 48 AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2010
The purpose of this report is to inform shareholders  
of the company's policy and practice on executive 
remuneration and the associated governance 
arrangements. As well as the required statutory 
disclosures, we aim to give a forward-looking 
statement of approach within the bounds of 
commercial confidentiality. Following a review of how 
the existing remuneration policy and practice 
supported our Vision 2015 strategy, various changes 
are proposed to incentive arrangements. These are 
summarised below and those which will require 
shareholder approval are described more fully in the 
shareholder circular setting out the resolutions to be 
put to the 2011 Annual General Meeting.
Remuneration committee structure  
and processes
During the year, the members of the remuneration 
committee were Mr T W Faithfull (Chairman),  
Ms M O Hesse (up to May), Mr S R Thompson,  
Mr N Carson (from August) and Mr C Day (from 
October). The Chairman of the board, Mr J Green-
Armytage, was a member of the committee up to  
June when the committee's terms of reference were 
updated to clarify that although he will normally  
attend meetings, he is no longer a member .  
The committee's terms of reference can be found at  
amec.com/aboutus/culture/corporategovernance  
or on request from the Company Secretary. 
In considering the matters within its remit, the 
committee takes account of recommendations from 
the Chairman in respect of the Chief Executive and 
from the Chief Executive in respect of other executive 
directors. It is advised both by the company's Human 
Resources department and independently by Hewitt 
New Bridge Street (HNBS). The terms of engagement 
between the company and HNBS are available from 
the Company Secretary. Neither HNBS nor its parent, 
Hewitt Associates, undertakes any material additional 
work for the company. Hewitt Associates is now  
wholly owned by Aon Corporation and while other 
companies within the Aon group do undertake  
material non-remuneration work for the company,  
the committee does not believe that the independence 
of its adviser is compromised in any way.
The committee has an established annual agenda of 
items that it considers at regular meetings normally 
held in February/March, June/August and November/
December, the major elements of which are 
summarised below:
November/ 
December
Overall remuneration policy and 
practices, incorporating risk 
review; review of individual base 
salaries and total remuneration
February/ 
March
Confirmation of annual bonus and 
long-term incentive outcomes and 
new awards; appointment of 
consultants
June/August Committee processes; incentive 
plan structures
In 2010 meetings were held in both June and August 
when a major additional item for discussion was the 
alignment of remuneration policy and practice to 
support the delivery of our Vision 2015 strategic 
objectives. 
Remuneration risk
In 2009 the committee established a process to 
conduct on an annual basis a formal risk review of  
its remuneration policy and practice. As part of this 
process, the committee receives input from its 
independent remuneration consultant. This process 
was described more fully in last year's report.  
This year's review also informed the strategic review  
of the remuneration policy as set out below.
Overall, and following the changes which will be made 
to the remuneration policy in 2011 (as set out below), 
the committee remains satisfied that the structure of 
executive remuneration supports the needs of the 
business in that the elements of fixed pay and benefits, 
annual bonus and long-term incentives provide 
sufficient flexibility to address the objectives of 
alignment, motivation and retention. In particular,  
the making of rolling three-year share awards on an 
annual basis, with revisions to targets as appropriate, 
encourages a culture of continuous performance 
improvement with a longer-term focus. The strong 
emphasis on executives investing and holding shares  
in the company helps build consistent alignment with 
shareholder value.

Remuneration policy
The objective of the remuneration policy, in respect of 
the executive directors and other senior executives, is to 
offer remuneration packages that are competitive in the 
markets in which the executives are based and which: 
O O
 allow AMEC to attract and retain senior executives  
of high calibre; and
O O
 incentivise senior executives to achieve superior 
short-term performance and increase the medium 
and long-term value of AMEC for its shareholders 
and encourage executives to build and retain a 
significant shareholding in AMEC. 
More specifically the policy is to set: 
O O
 base salaries which broadly equate to the mid-
market salary practices of a relevant group of oil 
equipment and services and other engineering and 
business support services companies and other 
companies regarded as comparable by virtue of, 
amongst other factors, revenue, employee numbers, 
market capitalisation and/or geographic coverage
O O
 annual bonuses which incentivise the achievement 
of stretching business and individual performance 
targets and offer the opportunity to achieve upper 
quartile annual cash earnings if these targets  
are achieved
O O
 longer term incentives which align the interests of 
shareholders and senior executives by offering the 
latter the opportunity to accumulate significant 
capital over a period but only if stretching financial 
and shareholder value targets are met
whilst accepting that within this policy there will be 
occasions when higher and/or lower levels of 
remuneration will be appropriate in particular 
circumstances. 
Following a review of the policy in the light of our  
Vision 2015 strategy and objectives (see page 6) and  
the vesting of the one-off Transformation Incentive 
Plan during 2011, the committee concluded that  
a greater relative emphasis should be placed on 
incentive pay and executive investment in order to drive 
even higher levels of earnings growth on a progressive 
basis without encouraging inappropriate risk taking. 
Accordingly and following consultation with major 
shareholders a number of changes are being made as 
set out more fully in the relevant sections following. 
In summary, the changes are:
O O
  No increases in base pay (other than for a significant 
role change) in 2011 for executive directors
O O
 An increase in annual bonus opportunity for 
executive directors, payable only if additional stretch 
EBITA is achieved, beyond the Maximum target that 
applies to other executives below board level 
O O
 The introduction of bonus deferral and  
claw-back arrangements
O O
 An increase in the co-investment/matching element 
of long-term incentives coupled with tougher 
earnings per share performance requirements 
(subject, where required, to shareholder approval  
as described in the shareholder circular)
O O
 An increase to share ownership requirements. 
The policy means that an increased proportion of 
executive directors' remuneration is performance 
related. The chart below shows the balance between 
fixed and incentive based payments for the Chief 
Executive at threshold and maximum performance 
levels. Maximum assumes achievement of maximum 
bonus and full vesting of shares under the 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) and assumes that the 
full investment/matching opportunity has been taken. 
Threshold values are 25 per cent of maximum bonus 
excluding the deferred element and 25 per cent vesting 
of the Performance Share Plan award.

Executive directors' base salaries 
The base salaries of executive directors are reviewed 
annually, having regard to personal performance, 
company performance, competitive market practice  
as determined by external research and pay levels 
more broadly within the company. The following annual 
salaries have been approved from 1 January 2011: 
S Y Brikho  875,500 No change
I P McHoul  486,675 No change
N A Bruce  450,000 + 15.4 per cent
Mr Bruce's increase reflects his appointment as  
Group Chief Operating Officer in August 2010, when  
he became additionally responsible for the Earth & 
Environmental business. He received an interim 
increase from  340,000 to  390,000 from 1 July 2010  
to reflect the previous increase in his responsibilities  
to include Power & Process.
In the senior management group, no executive has a 
base salary higher than any executive director . 
Annual bonuses 
The executive directors and other senior executives 
participate in the AMEC Executive Annual Bonus Plan 
which generates bonus payments calculated by 
reference to a mix of EBITA, cash flow and personal 
targets that vary from year to year and between 
individuals to reflect the business priorities associated 
with each role. 
Business performance targets are set so that a target 
level of bonus is paid normally for achieving the 
company's short-range plan. To achieve maximum 
bonus, a higher target has to be met. This takes 
account of the general business circumstances 
including the perceived difficulty inherent in the 
short-range plan and the need to balance stretch 
against risk. A threshold target is also set normally 
higher than the previous year's actual result, so that no 
bonus is paid unless there is year on year profit growth.
Business performance in 2010 exceeded the maximum 
targets set for this element. Accordingly total bonus 
payments for the year are near maximum. Further 
information on individual payments is set out in the 
notes to the table of directors' remuneration on  
page 56. 
As part of the changes referred to on page 49, the 
annual bonus opportunity for 2011 is being increased 
(for executive directors only) by 25 per cent of base 
salary for additional stretch EBITA performance, with 
any such additional bonus being deferred in AMEC 
shares for three years during which it would be subject 
to forfeiture and claw-back. The additional bonus would 
only begin to be earned for performance that exceeds 
the maximum target that applies to other executives 
below board level.
The breakdown of bonus potential (as a percentage of 
base salary) against targets for each executive director 
is as follows:

Executive directors' long-term incentives
Transformation Incentive Plan
A one-off incentive plan was approved in 2008 covering 
a three-year period up to 2010. It was designed to give 
additional impetus to the transformation of the 
company and to aid the retention of selected key top 
executives through this critical period. The plan required 
participants to invest and hold AMEC shares for a 
three-year period, with these investment shares then 
matched on an up to four-to-one basis. Mr Brikho 
participated in the plan with investment shares equal  
to 150 per cent of his annual salary at the time of 
invitation. Mr Bruce and Mr McHoul participated at  
an investment of 100 per cent of salary. 
Vesting of matched shares is based on achievement in 
2010 of operating margins on a sliding scale beginning 
at nil for a margin of 8 per cent and increasing on  
a straight line basis to full vesting for a margin of  
10 per cent. Margin calculation for this purpose is 
subject to the same earnings adjustments as apply in 
the Performance Share Plan (see below) other than  
a charge for one third of the total costs of the Plan.  
The awards were also subject to an earnings per share 
underpin of 53 pence and a review by the committee  
of the quality of the operating margin achieved: in this 
context, the committee had previously indicated that  
it would expect 2010 earnings per share of at least  
60 pence for full payout.
The committee considers that the Transformation 
Incentive Plan has achieved its objectives and has 
played an important role in supporting and rewarding 
the margin improvement over the three-year period. 
The committee has determined that the matching ratio 
on vesting will be 3.12 times the participant's original 
investment. The following numbers of shares will 
therefore vest for each of the executive directors on  
the dates shown:
Mr Brikho 426,488 shares on 15 May 2011
Mr Bruce 101,219 shares on 30 May 2011
Mr McHoul 160, 181 shares on 22 September 2011
There is a claw-back provision if the 2010 accounts 
have to be restated.
The plan has now ended and no further awards will be 
made under it.
Description of Performance Share Plan
Ongoing long-term incentives are provided through  
the Performance Share Plan under which annual 
awards are made of restricted shares that will vest 
after three years only to the extent that pre-determined 
performance targets are met. There are two 
performance conditions - total shareholder return 
(TSR) and earnings per share growth - each of  
which operates independently on different portions  
of the awards. 
Awards are made in two parts: a basic award and a 
matching award which requires participants to invest 
on a post-tax basis in AMEC shares that are held on 
their behalf as investment shares for the three-year 
performance period. If investment shares are 
withdrawn before the end of the performance period, 
the matching shares lapse. The policy for executive 
directors has been a basic award with a value at the 
time of award of up to 175 per cent of base salary plus 
a matching award up to a maximum of 25 per cent of 
base salary. Awards are also made to a wider group of 
executives, with lower levels of face value to reflect 
seniority and contribution. Awards are normally made 
in April following the publication of the annual results.
For the total shareholder return portion, the 
requirement for full vesting is for AMEC to be ranked  
in the top quartile of the chosen comparator group.  
No awards will vest if AMEC's performance is below 
median. If AMEC's performance is at the median,  
25 per cent of the award will vest. Between the median 
and the upper quartile, the award will vest on a 
straight-line basis. In addition, to ensure that AMEC's 
underlying performance is properly reflected,  
no awards will vest unless there has been sustained 
financial growth of the company to the satisfaction of 
the committee. 
For the earnings per share growth portion of the 
awards, threshold (25 per cent of that part of the award 
vests) and maximum (100 per cent of that award vests) 
requirements are set with straight-line vesting 
between these. This is determined by comparing the 
earnings per share achieved in the final year of the 
three-year period with that in the year immediately 
before the start of the period and expressing the 
growth as an annualised rate in excess of the increase 
in the UK Retail Prices Index over the same period.  52 AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2010
Earnings per share are adjusted for certain defined 
items and calculated on a consistent basis between 
base and final years. The remuneration committee 
takes appropriate external advice on the method of 
calculation and any adjusting and potentially adjusting 
items. Performance against the total shareholder 
return targets is calculated independently and reviewed 
by the remuneration committee. In the event of a 
change of control, awards will normally vest to the 
extent that the performance conditions have been met 
at the date the change of control takes place.
Awards are made by the trustee of the AMEC  
Employee Share Trust, currently BWCI Trust Company 
Limited. Shares held by the trustee in connection  
with the Performance Share Plan may be voted at  
their discretion.
Changes to the plan
For the reasons outlined on page 49, the committee 
has made a number of changes to the operation of  
the plan for the awards to be made in 2011 and  
future years. 
O O
 The composition of the comparator group, which is 
reviewed at the time of each set of awards, has up to 
2010 comprised only UK-listed companies in relevant 
FTSE subsectors. For 2011, the group has been 
amended to include a number of non-UK listed 
companies who are direct business competitors of 
AMEC and to exclude UK companies where there is 
little or no overlap in activities - see table on page 53. 
Lists of the comparator companies for the 2008 
awards that vested during the year and the awards 
made in 2009 can be obtained on request from the 
Company Secretary 
O O
 The previous policy of requiring compound annual 
earnings per share growth (over inflation) of 3 to 
10 per cent has been increased to a vesting range  
of 5 to 12 per cent growth. For any set of annual 
awards, in line with previous practice, the committee 
has the discretion to set absolute targets that 
represent a higher stretch for that particular 
three-year performance period
O O
 The matching share part of the award will be solely 
dependent on the revised earnings per share target. 
As before, half of the basic part of the award will 
continue to be dependent on earnings per share and 
half on total shareholder return
O O
 The matching award policy for executive directors 
and selected other senior executives (members of 
the Group Management Team) will be increased 
from 25 per cent to 75 per cent. To permit this for 
those receiving maximum awards, a change is 
required in the Plan rules to increase the overall 
maximum award from the current 200 per cent to 
250 per cent and shareholder approval is being 
sought for this change. The intention is to make  
2011 awards up to the existing maximum at the 
normal time in April and, if approval is obtained at 
the 2011 Annual General Meeting, to make 
subsequent top-up matching awards
O O
 To achieve the maximum 75 per cent of salary 
matching awards, the investment required will 
increase from 15 per cent to 37.5 per cent of net  
pay enabled by a change in the matching ratio on 
investment shares to two for one (from five for three) 
O O
 As previously approved by shareholders and provided 
for in the existing Plan rules, the number of shares 
vesting from these awards will be increased to take 
account of reinvested dividends during the three-
year performance period.

Other share plans 
No awards have been made under the Executive Share 
Option Scheme since 2004. Authority for this plan is 
due to lapse in 2012.
In addition, executive directors may participate in 
relevant all-employee share plans which provide 
options, without performance conditions, related to 
savings contracts with an aggregate limit of  250 
savings per month. 
Share ownership guidelines
Guidelines are in place requiring executive directors 
and other senior executives (which include all such 
participants in the Transformation Incentive Plan) to 
build up over a three-year period and retain a holding  
of AMEC shares received from incentive plans or 
purchased by them. The current level of targeted 
shareholding is two times salary for executive directors 
and one times salary for other senior executives. 
Details of directors' interests at the end of 2010 are 
listed on page 40 of the report of the directors.  
Based on the average share price and salaries during 
December 2010, these shareholdings represented the 
following percentages of base salary:
Mr Brikho 1,486 per cent
Mr Bruce 218 per cent
Mr McHoul 195 per cent
Mr McHoul joined in September 2008. 
Part of the proposal to increase the matching 
opportunity under the performance share plan is to 
raise the shareholding requirement to two and a half 
times salary for Executive Directors and one and a 
quarter times salary for other members of the Group 
Management Team. If this change is approved by 
shareholders, those affected would have until the end 
of 2013 to meet the higher target.
Up to date details of the interests and transactions of 
current directors are available on our website.  54 AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2010
Executive directors' pension arrangements 
and other benefits
Executive directors are eligible for membership of the 
AMEC Staff Pension Scheme and to have top-up 
benefits provided through the AMEC Executive Pension 
Scheme. The schemes are both defined benefit 
schemes registered with the UK's HM Revenue & 
Customs (HMRC) and also provide for life assurance 
cover and dependants' pensions. There are no 
unregistered pension arrangements.
Executive directors who participate in the pension 
schemes accrue pension rights which are linked to the 
length of pensionable service and to pensionable 
salary. Executive directors who remain in employment 
beyond normal pension age are able to continue to 
accrue further pension rights. Pensionable salary in 
respect of scheme membership up to the end of 2007 
is based on final salary and in respect of membership 
from 2008 onwards is based on career average 
revalued earnings. Benefits are restricted to a scheme 
earnings cap which was set at  135,000 for the 2010/11 
tax year ( 141,250 for 2011/12). In recognition of this 
restriction of pension benefits, participating executive 
directors also receive a taxable supplement of 20 per 
cent of their base salaries above the cap. 
Executive directors are able to opt-out in which case 
they will receive a salary supplement of 20 per cent  
of basic salary in lieu of further pension accrual.  
If individuals do accrue benefits that exceed either the 
Annual or the Life Time Allowances, the payment of the 
associated tax liability will be the responsibility of the 
individual and not AMEC. 
Mr Brikho is a member of both pension schemes with 
a normal pension age of 60 and also has the benefit of 
additional life assurance in respect of earnings above 
the cap. Mr Bruce also participates and has a normal 
pension age of 62 with a historic right to draw accrued 
pension from age 57 onwards without actuarial 
reduction for early payment. Mr McHoul has not joined 
the schemes and therefore receives the 20 per cent 
supplement on his full salary and also has the benefit 
of life assurance of four times his basic salary.
Employment related benefits, principally the provision 
of a company car or car allowance, long-term disability 
and private medical expenses insurance, are also 
provided to executive directors. 
Executive directors' employment contracts
AMEC's policy is that on appointment, executive 
directors will normally be employed with a notice period 
of one year . In the event of employment being 
terminated with less notice than this, damages will be 
determined at the time taking account of the 
circumstances leading up to the termination and the 
individual's duty to mitigate his loss. Executive directors 
are required to give six months' notice of resignation. 
This policy is followed for all current executive directors. 
Service contracts for executive directors do not provide 
for extended notice periods, other enhancements or 
payments in the event of a change of control. It is not 
the remuneration committee's intention to introduce 
such provisions.
The service contracts of the executive directors are 
available for review at the Company's registered office 
in accordance with relevant legislation.
External directorships
Executive directors are not permitted to accept external 
directorships without the prior approval of the board. 
Mr McHoul is a director and chairman of the audit 
committee of Premier Foods plc for which he received 
remuneration of  70,000 during the year .
Directors' remuneration report continued Chairman
The remuneration committee is responsible for 
determining the remuneration and other terms of 
appointment of the Chairman of the board. The 
agreement with the Chairman, Mr Green-Armytage, 
runs to 5 May 2011, which is the date of the 2011 Annual 
General Meeting and he intends to retire on that date. 
The search for his successor is well underway but as 
reported on page 40, Mr Green-Armytage has agreed to 
stay on as Chairman in the event that his successor has 
not been appointed by then. The chairman's fee of 
 245,000 per annum has not been increased for 2011. 
He is provided with life assurance cover of four times  
the AMEC pension scheme earnings cap. He does not 
participate in other benefit schemes or in any of the 
incentive schemes of the group.
Non-executive directors 
The remuneration of non-executive directors is 
determined by the chairman and the executive 
directors under delegated authority from the board. 
The non-executive directors receive fees for their 
services and do not participate in any of the incentive  
or benefit schemes of the group. The policy with regard 
to fee structure is to reflect time commitment and 
responsibility of the various roles.
Fees were reviewed with effect from 1 January 2011. 
The current base fee was increased by around three 
per cent to  54,000 per annum. There is an additional 
fee of  8,125 per annum paid to the senior independent 
director . Additional fees are paid for chairing 
committees of the board as follows:
Audit committee  13,125 
Remuneration committee  8,125 
Compliance and ethics committee  5,400
The board's policy is that non-executive director 
appointments are normally for three consecutive 
three-year terms, subject to review after the end of 
each term. The non-executive directors as at  
31 December 2010 have fixed-term contracts which 
run until the dates set out below:

shareholders at the AGM following initial appointment and every three 
years thereafter . As reported on page 40, the Board has recently agreed 
that all directors will submit themselves for re-election on an annual 
basis, in line with the recommendations in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
The contracts of non-executive directors may be 
terminated by the individual at any time and there are 
no specific provisions for compensation in the event of 
early termination by the company.

Notes 
(i)  For the PSP awards made in 2007, AMEC met the performance conditions for maximum vesting. The share price at the date of vesting  
was 799.0 pence. 
(ii) The terms and conditions of the PSP and TIP awards have not been varied during the year .
(iii)  The vesting date for awards under the TIP is three years from the date the individuals lodged their investment shares. The maximum number 
of shares that individuals could invest was based on salary and share price at the time of invitation. The award indicated represents the 
maximum four times match. Details of the expected vesting are included on page 51.
(iv)  The closing price of the shares at 31 December 2010 was 1150.0 pence (2009: 792.0 pence). Had the outstanding restricted shares detailed 
above vested in full on that date the approximate latent value before appropriate taxes for each of the current directors would have been:  
Mr Brikho  14,871,000, Mr Bruce  4,575,000 and Mr McHoul  7,185,000. These hypothetical figures assume that all relevant performance 
conditions would have been fully met, which in practice may not transpire.
(v) The range of the closing prices for the shares during the year was 733.5 pence to 1168.0 pence.
(vi)  The register of directors' interests, which is open to inspection at the company's registered office, contains full details of directors' 
shareholdings, share options and awards under the performance share plans.
