Directors' remuneration report Directors' remuneration report 
The purpose of this report is to show how the company 
determines the remuneration arrangements for 
executive directors and how this relates to the Vision 
2015 growth strategy and the company's performance. 
How we operate
The remuneration committee's membership 
comprises all the non-executive directors and the 
Chairman. Its terms of reference can be found at  
amec.com/aboutus/culture/corporategovernance 
or on request from the Company Secretary. 
In considering the matters within its remit, the 
committee takes account of recommendations from 
the Chairman in respect of the Chief Executive and 
from the Chief Executive in respect of other executive 
directors. It is advised both by our Human Resources 
department and independently by New Bridge Street 
(NBS). The terms of engagement between the 
company and NBS are available from the Company 
Secretary. NBS does not undertake any material 
additional work for AMEC. NBS is wholly owned by  
Aon Corporation and while other companies within the 
Aon group do undertake material non-remuneration 
work for the company, the committee does not believe 
that the independence of its adviser is compromised  
in any way. 
The committee normally meets three times a year  
and has an established annual agenda of items that it 
considers at the various meetings, the major elements 
of which are summarised below:

Remuneration structure and policy
Executive remuneration comprises four elements:  
base salary, benefits, annual bonus and long-term 
incentive (L TI).  The committee's aim is to balance each 
of these elements so as to provide remuneration 
packages that are competitive in the markets in which 
the executives are based and which incentivise senior 
executives to achieve superior short-term performance 
while increasing the medium and long-term value of 
AMEC for its shareholders. We are particularly keen to 
encourage executives to build and retain a significant 
shareholding in AMEC.
More specifically our approach is to:
   
Review base salaries annually taking account of pay 
levels more broadly within the company and the 
market including a review of the mid-market 
practices of a relevant group of companies regarded 
as comparable by virtue of, amongst other factors, 
revenue, employee numbers, market capitalisation 
and/or geographic coverage 
   
Set annual bonus financial targets that provide an 
incentive to achieve and improve on the company's 
demanding short-range plan and which link to the 
achievement of the company's longer-term strategy. 
The threshold for the EBITA element is also normally 
set higher than the previous year's actual result. The 
structure of the annual bonus plan is described in 
more detail on page 58
   
Make annual share-based awards that are subject  
to both absolute and comparative performance 
targets over a three-year period. A key element of  
this plan is that part of each year's award is dependent 
on the executives investing their own money in  
AMEC shares and holding these for the three-year 
period. The structure of the long-term incentive plan 
(Performance Share Plan - PSP) is described in  
more detail on pages 58 and 59
   
Review overall remuneration levels and the balance 
between these elements to ensure that they are in 
line with competitive market practice as determined 
by external research. Our current approach is to have 
a higher weighting on long-term than annual 
incentives to support the focus on delivering our 
Vision 2015 growth strategy. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 57 
Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 
The chart below shows the balance between fixed  
and incentive based payments for the Chief Executive 
at threshold and maximum performance levels. 
Maximum assumes achievement of maximum bonus 
and full vesting of shares under the PSP and assumes 
that the full investment/matching opportunity has 
been taken. Threshold values are 25 per cent of 
maximum bonus excluding the deferred element (see 
page 58) and 25 per cent vesting of the PSP award.

2011 performance and its reflection in 
pay levels
The company had another strong year with EBITA 
growing year on year by 12 per cent. The result was 
above the level that had been set for target bonus but 
below the target for maximum and hence also did  
not achieve the additional stretch for the deferred 
element. Cash flow was just above the threshold level.  
Achievement against strategic personal bonus targets 
was strong. This resulted in the following annual 
bonus payments to each of the three executive 
directors (expressed as percentage of base salary 
earned in the year):
Max Actual 2010
Samir Brikho 150 96 121
Ian McHoul 125 77 92
Neil Bruce 125 77 97
Three-year earnings per share growth (2011 versus 
2008) on the basis used for the PSP was 64.0 per cent.  
This exceeded the required growth of 45.5 per cent  
(10 per cent per annum plus RPI) for maximum 
payment for that element of the 2009 PSP awards. The 
second element is dependent on comparative Total 
Shareholder Return based on the average share price 
for the first quarter of each year . The outcome of this 
will not be known until April when the relevant portion 
of the shares will vest. 
The table on page 63 shows the number of shares 
vesting during 2011 under both the PSP and the 
one-off Transformation Incentive Plan. However 
both of these awards vested on the basis of 2010 
performance as explained in notes (ii) and (iii) to 
the table.  
As set out in last year's remuneration report, the 
one-off Transformation Incentive Plan covered the 
period 2008 to 2010 and was designed to give 
additional impetus to the transformation of the 
company and to aid retention of selected top 
executives through this critical period. The main 
performance measure was 2010 operating margin.  
A full description of the plan and the outcome against 
the performance measures was included in last year's 
remuneration report. The plan is now ended and no 
further awards can be made under it.
Changes for 2012
The following annual salaries have been approved 
from 1 January 2012: 
From 1 Jan 2012 
salary
From 1 Jan 2012 
% increase
1 Jan 2011

Samir Brikho  900,000 2.8 Nil
Ian McHoul  500,000 2.7 Nil
Neil Bruce  475,000 5.6 15.4
 
These increases are within the range of those 
awarded to AMEC UK-based employees generally.  
Awards to employees in other countries were 
generally higher with average increases by country 
ranging from 3 to 9 per cent. Neil Bruce's increase 
reflects his continuing development in the Group COO 
role to which he was appointed in the second half of 
2010.
The methodology for the cash element of the annual 
bonus has been adjusted to provide additional focus on 
the conversion of profit to cash. 58
Directors' remuneration report Directors' remuneration report continued
AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011
Annual bonus plan
The executive directors and other senior executives 
participate in the AMEC Executive Annual Bonus  
Plan which generates bonus payments calculated by 
reference to a mix of EBITA, cash flow and personal 
targets that vary from year to year and between 
individuals to reflect the business priorities associated 
with each role and link to the achievement of our overall 
Vision 2015 objectives.
Business performance targets are set so that a target 
level of bonus is paid normally for achieving the 
company's short-range plan. To achieve maximum 
bonus, higher targets have to be met. In determining 
targets, the committee takes account of the general 
business circumstances including the perceived 
difficulty inherent in the short-range plan and the need 
to balance stretch against risk. Executive directors have 
an additional bonus opportunity for super-stretch 
EBITA performance, with any such additional bonus 
being deferred in AMEC shares for three years during 
which it is subject to forfeiture and claw-back. The 
additional bonus only begins to be earned for 
performance that exceeds the maximum target that 
applies to other executives below board level.
Cash flow is split into two elements, one based on  
profit to cash conversion for the year as a whole and 
one based on average year-to-date cash flow.
The breakdown of bonus potential (as a percentage  
of base salary) for each executive director at various 
performance levels is as follows: 
Chief Executive COO and CFO
Threshold EBITA 17.5 13.75
Cash flow 6.25 5
Target EBITA 46.67 36.67
Cash flow 16.67 13.33
Maximum EBITA 70 55
Cash flow 25 20
Super stretch* EBITA 25 25
Other strategic 
objectives
30 25
Overall maximum 150 125
*This element, introduced in 2011, is paid as shares deferred for three 
years during which it is subject to forfeiture and claw-back.
Performance Share Plan
Long-term incentives for the top management group 
are provided through the Performance Share Plan 
under which annual awards are made of shares that 
will vest after three years only to the extent that 
pre-determined performance targets are met. For 
awards from 2011 onwards, the number of shares 
vesting from these awards is increased to take account 
of reinvested dividends during the three-year 
performance period. Where awards are made in the 
form of nil cost options, participants have an eighteen-
month period following vesting in which to exercise.  
Awards are made in two parts: a basic award and a 
matching award which requires participants to invest 
on a post-tax basis in AMEC shares that are held on 
their behalf as investment shares for the three-year 
performance period and matched two for one. If 
investment shares are withdrawn before the end of the 
performance period, the matching shares lapse. The 
policy for executive directors is a basic award with a 
value at the time of award of up to 175 per cent of base 
salary plus a matching award up to a maximum of  
75 per cent of base salary. This latter assumes the 
maximum investment of 37.5 per cent of post-tax 
salary - participants may invest less than this and the 
matching award reduces accordingly. Awards are 
normally made in April.
There are two performance conditions - total 
shareholder return (TSR) and earnings per share growth 
- each of which operates independently on different 
portions of the awards. Half of the basic part of the award 
is dependent on earnings per share and half on total 
shareholder return. The matching share part of the 
award is solely dependent on earnings per share.
For the total shareholder return portion, the 
requirement for full vesting is for AMEC to be ranked  
in the top quartile of the chosen comparator group. 
No awards will vest if AMEC's performance is below 
median. If AMEC's performance is at the median, 25 
per cent of the award will vest. Between the median 
and the upper quartile, the award will vest on a straight-
line basis. In addition, to ensure that AMEC's underlying 
performance is properly reflected, no awards will vest 
unless there has been sustained financial growth of the 
company to the satisfaction of the committee. The 
comparator group for the awards to be made in 2012  
is set out on the next page.  AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 59

Lists of the comparator companies for the 2008 
awards that vested during the year and the awards 
made in 2009, 2010 and 2011 were disclosed in 
previous years' reports.
For the earnings per share growth portion of the 
awards, threshold (25 per cent of that part of the 
award vests) and maximum (100 per cent of that 
award vests) requirements are set with straight-line 
vesting between these. This is determined by 
comparing the earnings per share achieved in the 
final year of the three-year period with that in the 
year immediately before the start of the period and 
expressing the growth as an annualised rate in 
excess of the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index 
over the same period. In line with the PSP awards 
granted in 2011, for the awards to be made in 2012, 
the real growth requirement for minimum vesting is 
5 per cent per annum and for maximum vesting it is 
12 per cent per annum. For the awards made in 2009 
and 2010 the growth requirement is 3 to 10 per cent 
with, in the case of the 2010 awards, an underpin that 
2012 earnings per share must be greater than 62 
pence. The 2008 awards had a range of 45 to 53 
pence for 2010 earnings per share.
The earnings per share figure is adjusted for certain 
defined items and calculated on a consistent basis 
between base and final years. The remuneration 
committee takes appropriate external advice on  
the method of calculation and any adjusting and 
potentially adjusting items. Performance against  
the total shareholder return targets is calculated 
independently and reviewed by the remuneration 
committee. In the event of a change of control, 
awards will normally vest to the extent that the 
performance conditions have been met at the date 
the change of control takes place. 
Awards are also made under the Plan to a wider 
group of senior managers, with lower levels of face 
value. The application of performance conditions and 
matching criteria may also be varied for this group.
Shares held by the trustee of the AMEC Employee 
Share Trust (currently BWCI Trust Company Limited), 
in connection with the Performance Share Plan, may 
be voted at their discretion.
Other share plans
No awards have been made under the Executive 
Share Option Scheme since 2004. Authority for this 
plan is due to lapse in 2012. In addition, executive 
directors may participate in relevant all-employee 
share plans that provide options, without 
performance conditions, related to savings contracts 
with an aggregate limit of  250 savings per month.
Directors' share interests

Except for interests under share option schemes  
and the Performance Share Plan, details of which are 
contained in this report, no director as at 31 December 
2011 had any other interests, beneficial or otherwise, 
in the share capital of the company or any of its 
subsidiaries. 
On 9 January 2012, John Connolly acquired 190 
shares, which he elected to receive for part of his 
shareholding, in lieu of the interim dividend paid on  
3 January 2012. There were no other changes in the 
directors' interests in the share capital of the company 
between 31 December 2011 and 21 February 2012.  
Up to date details of the interests and transactions  
of current directors are available on our website.
Share ownership guidelines
Guidelines are in place requiring executive directors 
and members of the Group Management team to 
build up over a three-year period and retain a holding 
of AMEC shares received from incentive plans or 
purchased by them. The level of targeted 
shareholding was increased during 2011 from 200  
to 250 per cent of base salary for executive directors 
and from 100 to 125 per cent of base salary for other 
senior executives. Executives have until the end of 
2013 to build up to the higher target. Based on the 
average share price and salaries during December 
2011, the shareholdings shown above represented the 
following percentages of base salary:
Samir Brikho 1,660  per cent
Ian McHoul 415  per cent
Neil Bruce 211  per cent
Executive directors' pension 
arrangements and other benefits
Executive directors are eligible for membership of  
the AMEC Staff Pension Scheme and to have top-up 
benefits provided through the AMEC Executive 
Pension Scheme. The schemes are both defined 
benefit schemes registered with the UK's HM Revenue 
& Customs (HMRC) and also provide for life 
assurance cover and dependants' pensions.  
There are no unregistered pension arrangements.
Executive directors who participate in the pension 
schemes accrue pension rights that are linked to the 
length of pensionable service and to pensionable 
salary. Executive directors who remain in employment 
beyond normal pension age are able to continue to 
accrue further pension rights. Pensionable salary in 
respect of scheme membership up to the end of 2007 
is based on final salary and in respect of membership 
from 2008 onwards is based on career average 
revalued earnings. Benefits are restricted to a 
scheme earnings cap which was set at  141,250 for 
the 2011/12 tax year ( 149,000 for 2012/13). In 
recognition of this restriction of pension benefits, 
participating executive directors also receive a taxable 
supplement of 20 per cent of their base salaries above 
the cap. Executive directors are able to opt-out, in 
which case they will receive a salary supplement of  
20 per cent of basic salary in lieu of further pension 
accrual. If individuals do accrue benefits that exceed 
either the Annual or the Life Time Allowances, the 
payment of the associated tax liability will be the 
responsibility of the individual and not AMEC.
Samir Brikho is a member of both pension schemes 
with a normal pension age of 60 and also has the 
benefit of additional life assurance in respect of 
earnings above the cap. Neil Bruce also participates 
and has a normal pension age of 62 with a historic 
right to draw accrued pension from age 57 onwards 
without actuarial reduction for early payment. Ian 
McHoul has not joined the schemes and therefore 
receives the 20 per cent supplement on his full salary 
and also has the benefit of life assurance of four times 
his basic salary.
Employment related benefits, principally the provision 
of a company car or car allowance, long-term 
disability and private medical expenses insurance,  
are also provided to executive directors.
Executive directors' employment contracts 
AMEC's policy is that on appointment, executive 
directors will normally be employed with a notice 
period of one year . In the event of employment being 
terminated with less notice than this, damages will  
be determined at the time taking account of the 
circumstances leading up to the termination and  
the individual's duty to mitigate the loss. Executive 
directors are required to give six months' notice of 
resignation. This policy is followed for all current 
executive directors.
Contracts for executive directors do not provide for 
extended notice periods, other enhancements or  AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 61 
Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 
payments in the event of a change of control. It is not 
the remuneration committee's intention to introduce 
such provisions. The contracts of the executive 
directors are available for review at the company's 
registered office in accordance with relevant 
legislation.
External directorships
Executive directors are not permitted to accept 
external directorships without the prior approval of 
the board. Ian McHoul is a director and chairman of 
the audit committee of Premier Foods plc for which 
he received remuneration of  70,000 during the year .  
Samir Brikho and Neil Bruce each hold one external 
directorship with a charity for which they receive no 
remuneration.
Samir Brikho's role as a member of the Advisory 
Board of Stena AB is not a non-executive directorship. 
He received fees of CHF60,000 during the year in 
relation to this appointment. 
Chairman
The remuneration committee is responsible for 
determining the remuneration and other terms of 
appointment of the Chairman of the board. John 
Connolly receives an annual fee of  300,000 which is 
due to be reviewed on 1 January 2013. He does not 
participate in any AMEC benefit schemes or incentive 
schemes. His engagement may be terminated on six 
months' notice on either side. The previous Chairman, 
Jock Green-Armytage, retired in May 2011, and was 
paid until the end of the second quarter .
Non-executive directors
The remuneration of non-executive directors is 
determined by the Chairman and the executive 
directors under delegated authority from the board. 
The non-executive directors receive fees for their 
services and do not participate in any of the incentive 
or benefit schemes of the group. The policy with 
regard to fee structure is to reflect time commitment 
and responsibility of the various roles. 
Fees were reviewed with effect from 1 January 2012 
and increased by an average 2.8 per cent. The current 
base fee is  55,500 per annum. There is an additional 
fee of  8,350 per annum paid to the Senior 
Independent Director . Additional fees are paid for 
chairing committees of the board as follows:
Audit committee  13,500
Remuneration committee  8,350
Ethics committee  5,550
The board's policy is that non-executive director 
appointments are normally for three consecutive 
three-year terms, subject to review after the end of 
each term. The non-executive directors as at 31 
December 2011 have fixed-term contracts that run 
until the dates set out below:
Date of contract Service review date
Tim Faithfull 10 February 2005 2014 AGM
Simon Thompson 21 January 2009 2012 AGM
Neil Carson 31 August 2010 2014 AGM
Colin Day 14 October 2010 2014 AGM
In accordance with the articles of association of 
AMEC, all directors are required to seek re-election 
by shareholders at the AGM following initial 
appointment and every three years thereafter . 
However, our practice is that all directors submit 
themselves for re-election on an annual basis, in line 
with the recommendations in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 
The contracts of non-executive directors may be 
terminated by the individual at any time. There are  
no specific provisions for compensation in the event 
of early termination by the company.

Notes
(i)  The terms and conditions of the above awards have not been varied during the year .
(ii)  For the PSP awards made in 2008, AMEC met the performance condition for maximum vesting of the portion dependant on earnings per 
share growth from 2007 to 2010 (actual adjusted EPS of 65.5 pence versus a target of 53 pence) and for 67 per cent vesting of the portion 
dependant on total shareholder return (ranking 10th out of 26). The share prices at the dates of vesting were 1192.0 pence for Samir Brikho 
and Neil Bruce and 899.0 pence for Ian McHoul.
(iii)   As reported last year, the achievement against the 2010 margin based performance condition for the TIP awards resulted in 78 per cent 
vesting. The vesting dates for awards under the TIP were three years from the dates the individuals lodged their investment shares and 
hence did not occur until 2011. The share prices at the respective dates of vesting were Samir Brikho 1175.0 pence, Neil Bruce 1154.0 pence 
and Ian McHoul 896.5 pence.
(iv)  The award made in June 2011 was a top-up to the award made in April, following shareholder approval at the AGM and the lodging of 
additional investment shares by the individual, and is subject to the same performance conditions and period.
(v)  The dividends which accrue on the PSP awards from 2011 onwards have increased the number of shares under the 2011 awards by 1.7 per 
cent at 31 December 2011. These will be awarded to the extent that the three-year performance targets are met.
(vi)   The closing price of the shares at 30 December 2011, the last trading day before year end, was 907.5 pence (2010: 1150.0 pence). Had the 
outstanding restricted shares detailed above vested in full, including the dividend accrual on the awards from 2011 onwards, on that date the 
approximate latent value before appropriate taxes for each of the current directors would have been: Samir Brikho  6,582,000, Neil Bruce 
 2,634,000 and Ian McHoul  3,660,000. These hypothetical figures assume that all relevant performance conditions would have been fully 
met, which in practice may not transpire.
(vii)   The range of the closing prices for the shares during the year was 740.5 pence to 1251.0 pence.
(viii)   The register of directors' interests, which is open to inspection at the company's registered office, contains full details of directors' 
shareholdings, share options and awards under the performance share plans. 64
