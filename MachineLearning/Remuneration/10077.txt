 AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2012 56
Directors' remuneration report
This year's report takes place against a backdrop of 
increased scrutiny of executive reward in general and 
impending legislation (taking effect for 2014) on how this 
is reported to and approved by shareholders. We welcome 
these moves to increase clarity and engagement and have 
sought to reflect elements of the changes in this year's 
report. AMEC has for many years already had two separate 
shareholder votes; one for the forward-looking policy and 
one for the whole remuneration report. We intend to 
continue this practice for the 2013 AGM and the relevant 
resolutions are contained in the shareholder circular .
2012 was another year of record performance for AMEC 
despite some of our markets becoming more challenging. 
In line with the committee's record over several years, 
we set stretching performance targets which were not 
fully met. Thus, overall levels of executive reward were 
lower than 2011. We will continue to take a robust 
approach to setting incentive targets at levels that will 
require significant out-performance against expectations 
in order to achieve the highest levels of reward. The first 
part of our report sets out in more detail the payments that 
relate to 2012 performance. Information on the termination 
arrangements for Neil Bruce, who stood down as an 
executive director and left AMEC in October following the 
restructuring of the business and the removal of his role 
as COO, is given on page 62.
As we do every year , we have reviewed our overall approach 
for the year ahead and concluded that the mix we have of 
fixed and variable pay (split between annual bonus and 
long-term share awards) remains broadly appropriate. 
We are therefore not proposing any substantive changes 
to policy . We are making a few minor changes to the 
operation of some of our plans and these are set out 
in the second part of the report.
I believe that the consistently good performance that we 
have achieved as a business over the last six years indicates 
that our approach to executive reward is doing its job. We 
will remain vigilant to ensure that it continues to support 
the growth of the business and that shareholders' views 
are appropriately reflected.
Tim Faithfull
Chairman, remuneration committee
How we operate
The committee' s membership comprises all the non-executive 
directors and the Chairman. Its terms of reference can be 
found at amec.com/aboutus/culture/corporategovernance 
or obtained on request from the Company Secretary . 
In considering the matters within its remit, the committee 
takes account of recommendations from the Chairman in 
respect of the Chief Executive and from the Chief Executive 
in respect of other executive directors and designated 
executives. It is advised both by the company's Human 
Resources department and independently by New Bridge 
Street (NBS). The terms of engagement between the 
company and NBS are available from the Company 
Secretary . NBS does not undertake any material additional 
work for the company . NBS is wholly owned by Aon plc 
and, while other companies within the Aon group do 
undertake material non-remuneration work for the 
company , the committee does not believe that the 
independence of its adviser is compromised in any way . 
NBS was paid  62,000 during the year for the advice 
provided to the committee. New Bridge Street is a member 
of the Remuneration Consultants Group and is a signatory 
to its code of conduct.
The committee normally meets three times a year and has 
an established annual agenda of items that it considers at 
the various meetings, the major elements of which are 
summarised below:
August
 Shareholder feedback/consultation
 Overall remuneration policy and 
practices
 Committee processes and 
appointment of consultants.
December
 Review of individual base salaries 
and total remuneration
 Incentive plan targets.
February
 Confirmation of short and long-term 
incentive outcomes
 New L TI awards.
The committee had two additional meetings in October 
2012; one to approve the termination arrangements for 
Neil Bruce and one to consider the directors ' remuneration 
reporting regulations.
The remuneration committee' s principal aims are to attract and retain 
good management and to incentivise them to increase the value of 
AMEC for its shareholders.  AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2012 57

Part 1 - 2012 performance and its reflection in pay levels
2012 performance
The main financial metrics that affect the level of incentive 
pay for directors and other senior executives are set out 
below, with a description of the outcomes. Overall 
performance was strong but in some areas fell below 
the demanding targets set for target and stretch reward:
EBITA Below target
Cash conversion Met stretch
Average cash Above target
Earnings per share (over three years) Met stretch
Further details of the EPS outcomes for the long-term 
incentive awards made in 2009 (vested in 2012) are set out 
under  Performance Share Plan' and for those made in 2010 
(due to vest in 2013) are set out under  Overall remuneration' .
Annual bonus
The bonus payments made to the two ongoing executive 
directors (expressed as a percentage of base salary earned 
during the year) are shown below reflecting the outcomes 
against the various performance elements described above:
Samir Brikho Ian McHoul
EBITA 95* 80*
Cash conversion 12.5* 10*
Average cash 12.5* 10*
Other strategic objectives 30* 25*
Maximum bonus 150 125
Actual bonus 85.4 68.5
* Maximum bonus opportunity for element 
 Other strategic objectives' for the Chief Executive included 
actions to grow the business through customer relationships, 
acquisition and geographic expansion; improving further 
our safety culture and performance; and succession 
management. For the CFO, they included better use of the 
balance sheet; accelerated reporting; extracting value from 
legacy work; and implementation of a major IT project.
None of the bonus earned for 2012 has been deferred 
into shares/options. 
The bonus amounts are shown in the table on page 62.
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Awards made under the Performance Share Plan in 2009 
vested during the year . This was based primarily on 2011 
performance. The targets set and the results achieved 
were as set out below.
% vesting
EPS (real CAGR)
Threshold RPI +3% 25%
Maximum RPI +10% 100%
Result RPI +13% 100%
TSR* ranking
Threshold Median 25%
Maximum 75th percentile 100%
Result 56th percentile 43%
* TSR = T otal Shareholder Return 
New awards were made under the plan in April 2012 to 
executive directors in line with current policy , namely a 
basic award with a face value of 175 per cent of base salary 
and a matching award with a face value up to 75 per cent of 
base salary . The matching award depends on the individual 
investing up to 37.5 per cent of post-tax salary in AMEC 
shares to be held for at least the three-year performance 
period, matched two for one. All executive directors took up 
the maximum opportunity . The basic award is subject to 
two performance conditions as before: EPS growth, with 
targets of RPI+ 5 per cent p.a. for threshold (25 per cent 
vesting) and RPI+ 12 per cent p.a. for maximum vesting; 
and relative TSR, underpinned by a financial growth. 
The matched award is subject to the EPS condition only .
The 2012 TSR comparator group comprises 12 UK 
companies, including AMEC, listed as being within the 
FTSE Oil & Gas or Industrials industries, with a market 
capitalisation greater than  1 billion, and the following 
international companies that AMEC competes directly 
with: Aker Solutions, Baker Hughes, Cameron Intl., 
Chicago Bridge & Iron, Fluor , Foster Wheeler , Halliburton, 
Jacobs, KBR, Saipem, Schlumberger , SNC-Lavalin Group, 
T echnip, URS and Worley Parsons. Details of the companies 
in the TSR comparator groups for previous years' awards 
are available from the Company Secretary on request.
Details of the numbers of shares vesting and awarded 
are included in the table on page 63. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2012 58
Part 1 - 2012 performance and its reflection in pay levels continued
Overall remuneration
The planned changes to the statutory reporting basis for 
future years include a requirement to show a single total 
remuneration figure for each director . The charts below 
illustrate the total remuneration paid to the two ongoing 
executive directors in respect of 2012 performance. 
This includes an estimate of the level of vesting of the 
award under the Performance Share Plan made in 2010 
which is not certain at the time of writing this report. This 
award, which is due to vest in April 2013, is subject to two 
performance conditions, each applying to half of the award. 
 The outcome of the earnings per share condition is 
dependent on the result achieved in 2012 compared 
to a base year of 2009. The EPS figure is adjusted for 
certain defined items and calculated on a consistent 
basis between base and final years. The remuneration 
committee takes appropriate advice on the method of 
calculation and any adjusting and potentially adjusting 
items. The actual growth achieved was 67.6 per cent 
compared to a required growth of 46.3 per cent for 
maximum payment (compound annual growth of 
12 per cent plus inflation measured by UK RPI). 
This half of the award will therefore vest in full
 The outcome of the total shareholder return condition 
is dependent on the average share price in the 
period 1 January to 31 March 2013 compared to the 
corresponding period in 2010. For the purposes of this 
illustration, we have assumed threshold vesting which 
equals 25 percent of this half of the award. The actual 
level of vesting may be higher or lower than this. 
For this illustration, the estimated number of shares has 
been valued at the share price on 31 December 2012.
Payments made to directors on the current statutory 
reporting basis are set out on page 62.
Performance graph 
This graph shows the value, by 31 December 2012, 
of  100 invested in AMEC plc on 31 December 2007 
compared with the value of  100 invested in the FTSE 100 
Index. The other points plotted are the values at intervening 
financial year ends.

from year to year and between 
individuals to reflect the 
business priorities associated 
with each role.
The additional stretch bonus is 
deferred in AMEC shares for 
three years during which time 
it is subject to forfeiture and 
claw-back. 
Bonus excluding additional 
stretch may at the directors' 
option, subject to the 
committee's agreement, be 
in the form of options over 
company shares of equivalent 
value instead of cash payment. 
The vesting is deferred for 
three months during which it 
is forfeit if the individual is a 
bad leaver . Options have a 
six-month exercise window.

of base salary for the  
Chief Executive and

The maximum opportunity 
is 150 per cent for the CEO 
and 125 per cent for the CFO 
which includes an additional 
stretch bonus of 25 per cent 
in each case.
Business performance 
targets are set so that a 
target level of bonus is paid 
normally for achieving the 
company' s short-range 
plan. T o achieve maximum 
bonus, higher targets have 
to be met. In determining 
targets, the committee takes 
account of the general 
business circumstances 
including the perceived 
difficulty inherent in the 
short-range plan and the 
need to balance stretch 
against risk. 
The additional stretch bonus 
is subject to EBITA targets 
and only begins to be earned 
for performance that exceeds 
the maximum target that 
applies to other executives.

Part 2 - Remuneration policy and changes for 2013 continued
Link between reward and business strategy
In determining and applying remuneration policy , our aim 
is to provide a mix of incentives supporting the overall 
business strategy of delivering sustainable growth that 
builds to superior performance over the longer term. 
T argets are set to be ambitious and stretching but not 
at a level that might encourage inappropriate risk-taking 
or short-termism.
Scenarios
The chart below shows the balance between fixed and 
incentive based payments for Samir Brikho at threshold 
and maximum performance levels:
The chart below shows the same for Ian McHoul:
 
Maximum assumes achievement of maximum bonus 
and full vesting of shares under the PSP and assumes 
that the full investment/matching opportunity has been 
taken. Threshold values are 25 per cent of maximum 
bonus excluding the additional stretch element and 
25 per cent vesting of the PSP award. The deferred bonus 
and PSP elements do not take account of any change in 
share price or reinvested dividend adjustments between 
award and vesting/exercise.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere 
in company and shareholder views
Our approach to the annual review of base salaries 
is to take account of personal performance, company 
performance and pay levels more broadly within the 
company . The increases for 2013 are within the range 
of increases awarded to AMEC staff in the UK generally . 
External benchmarking is also taken into account, 
particularly for new appointments.
Any proposals to change remuneration policy are 
considered against the  best practice' guidelines produced 
by shareholder bodies and we consult directly with major 
shareholders and their representative bodies when 
formulating any proposals for significant changes.
The Chairman of the company and the Chairman of 
the remuneration committee make themselves available 
to discuss any issues raised.
Service contracts and exit payments policy
AMEC's policy is that on appointment, executive directors 
will normally be employed with a notice period of twelve 
months. Executive directors are required to give six 
months' notice of resignation. This policy is followed for 
all current executive directors. There are no specified 
termination payments included in contracts but they do 
provide for payment to be made in lieu of all or part of the 
required notice at the company's discretion; there is no 
prescribed methodology for calculating such payment 
in lieu.
In the event of employment being terminated by AMEC 
with less notice than that provided for contractually , 
damages will be determined at the time taking account 
the circumstances leading up to the termination and 
the individual's duty to mitigate his or her loss.

Chairman
The remuneration committee is responsible for determining 
the remuneration and other terms of appointment of the 
Chairman of the board. The annual fee was reviewed on 
1 January 2013 and increased by 3 per cent to  309,000 
per annum. He does not participate in any AMEC benefit 
schemes or incentive schemes. His engagement may be 
terminated on six months' notice on either side. 
Non-executive directors
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined 
by the Chairman and the Chief Executive under delegated 
authority from the board. The non-executive directors 
receive fees for their services and do not participate in any 
of the incentive or benefit schemes of the group. The policy 
with regard to fee structure is to reflect time commitment 
and responsibility of the various roles.
Fees were reviewed with effect from 1 January 2013. The 
base fee was increased by 4.5 per cent to  58,000 per 
annum, subject to the approval of resolution 15 in the 
shareholder circular . There is an additional fee of  5,000 
per annum paid to the Senior Independent Director . 
Additional fees are paid for chairing committees of the 
board as follows:
Audit committee          17,500
Remuneration committee               12,500
Ethics committee           6,000
Linda Adamany receives a 20 per cent uplift that recognises 
the additional travelling time, given her home location in 
the US.
Fees are paid quarterly in advance. The contracts of 
non-executive directors may be terminated by the 
individual at any time. There are no specific provisions for 
compensation in the event of early termination by the 
company . As noted on page 43 our practice is that all 
directors submit themselves for re-election on an annual 
basis, in line with the recommendations in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.

capital of the company between 31 December 2012 and 
14 February 2013. Up-to-date details of the interests and 
transactions of current directors are available on our website.
Guidelines are in place requiring executive directors and 
members of the group management team to build up over 
a three-year period and retain a holding of AMEC shares 
received from incentive plans or purchased by them. The 
level of targeted shareholding is 250 per cent of salary for 
executive directors and 125 per cent for other senior 
executives. Based on the average share price and salaries 
during December 2012, the shareholdings shown above 
represented the following percentages of base salary:

for the part of the year prior to relocation.
Loss of office
Neil Bruce's employment terminated on the grounds of redundancy and he resigned from his executive directorship 
with immediate effect on 5 October 2012. His contractual notice period was 12 months. However , consistent with the 
company's policy of applying mitigation in determining severance, the company agreed with Neil Bruce that he would 
receive a payment in respect of six months ' notice only as a severance package. The package of  621,186 comprised: 
six months' basic salary and contractual benefits; a sum in respect of his 2012 bonus (calculated as a pre-estimate of 
his bonus for 2012, pro-rated to reflect the period worked by him); a statutory redundancy payment; accrued but untaken 
holiday entitlement as at the termination date; and legal fees. The treatment of his long-term incentives and pension is 
set out in the following tables and notes.

  The award made in June 2011 was a top-up to the award made in April, following shareholder approval at the AGM and the lodging of additional 
investment shares by the individual, and is subject to the same performance conditions and period
5
  The awards made in 2012 are in the form of nil-cost options which have an 18 month exercise period following vesting
6
   The dividends which accrue on the PSP awards from 2011 onwards have increased the number of shares under the 2011 awards by 4.9 per cent 
and the number of shares under the 2012 awards by 2.0 per cent at 31 December 2012. These will be awarded to the extent that the three-year 
performance targets are met
7
  The closing price of the shares at 31 December 2012 was 1,003.0 pence (2011: 907.5 pence). Had the outstanding restricted shares detailed 
above vested in full on that date, including the dividend accrual to date, the approximate latent value before appropriate taxes for each of the 
current directors would have been: Samir Brikho  6,159,000 and Ian McHoul  3,423,000. These hypothetical figures assume that all relevant 
performance conditions would have been fully met, which in practice may not transpire

 The range of the closing prices for the shares during the year was 923.0 pence to 1,172.0 pence

from age 62.
