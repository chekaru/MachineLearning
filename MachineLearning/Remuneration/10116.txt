Directors' remuneration report
Remuneration policy 
Introduction 
The description that follows sets out the policy that is subject to the new statutory binding vote at the 2014 AGM. It is 
intended that, if approved, it will take effect from that date (save that for the purposes of Section 226D(6) of the Companies 
Act, the effective date is the end of the financial year starting in 2014). It has been our practice in AMEC to seek shareholder 
approval on an annual basis for our remuneration policy and we will be following the policy approved at the 2013 AGM 
up to this new policy coming into effect.

Salary increases for executive directors will not normally 
exceed the average increase awarded to other employees 
based in the same country . Increases may be above this 
level if there is an increase in the scale, scope, complexity 
or responsibility of the role or to allow the base salary of 
newly appointed executives to move towards market 
norms as their experience and contribution increase. 
2014 salaries for executive directors are shown on 
page 69.
Pension 
and related 
benefits 
Normally through a fixed allowance, some or all of which can be 
paid in the form of a company contribution to a defined contribution 
pension plan with any balance paid as a cash supplement. Where the 
plan permits, individuals may also sacrifice on a like-for-like basis 
part of base salary in return for an enhanced company contribution. 
Pension plan membership is available on the same basis as for senior 
employees generally in the country in which the individual is based 
and there are no special arrangements for directors.
Life assurance is also provided.
Samir Brikho has a historic arrangement that provides for a pension 
payable from age 60 based on an accrual rate of one-thirtieth and on 
final pensionable salary in respect of service to 31 December 2007 
and career averaged revalued earnings in respect of service 
thereafter . Salary and earnings for pension purposes are subject 
to a cap, currently  153,000 pa for tax year 2013/14. The cap is 
increased annually , broadly in line with UK inflation. He also receives 
the pension allowance on salary above this cap as a cash supplement.
T o allow for the fluctuating value of defined benefit 
pension accrual and cost of life assurance, the 
aggregate value of those arrangements, company 
contribution to a defined contribution arrangement 
and cash supplement will not exceed 50 per cent 
of annual salary .
Other benefits Standard benefits typically include disability and healthcare insurance 
(including cover for eligible dependants), car/travel allowance, working 
lunches and tax return preparation assistance. 
Additional benefits may be paid where an individual is required by the 
company to relocate. This can include temporary housing prior to full 
relocation and a one-off payment to cover specific costs of moving 
home or an allowance of an equivalent amount paid for a fixed number 
of years. 
Where individuals are required to work in another country on a 
temporary basis, housing, travel, tax equalisation and cost of living 
adjustments may also be paid in line with the company' s normal policy 
for employees generally .
Other benefits may be provided from time to time where the 
committee feels it appropriate and in line with market practice 
to do so in the country in which the director is based.
The company may from time to time operate other arrangements that 
are open to employees in a particular country (for example, relating to 
savings, discounted purchase, salary sacrifice, holiday buy and sell, 
service recognition awards) that executive directors may participate 
in on the same basis as other employees in the country in which they 
are based.
The actual value of these benefits will vary from time 
to time depending, among other things, on the cost 
of insuring them. The intention is that the aggregate  
cost would be in line with market practice and will 
not exceed 100 per cent of annual salary where there 
is a relocation/expatriate element and 20 per cent of 
annual salary otherwise.
Annual bonus Rewards the achievement of annual 
financial and delivery of other 
strategic business targets.
Calculated by reference to a mix of financial and other strategic and 
personal objectives set by the remuneration committee that vary from 
year to year and between individuals to reflect the business priorities 
associated with each role. Profit-based measures will have a weighting 
of not less than 50 per cent. Part of the bonus is subject to an additional 
stretch profit target. Details of the actual measures for the periods under 
review are included in the Annual report on remuneration on page 69.
The target level of bonus on the financial targets element is two-thirds  
of maximum excluding additional stretch and the threshold level is  
25 per cent.
Payment of any bonus earned in relation to the additional stretch 
element is in the form of AMEC shares deferred for three years during 
which it is subject to  bad leaver' forfeiture and claw-back in the event 
that the accounts for the year for which the shares were earned are 
required to be restated for a correction of a prior period error . 
The balance of the bonus is normally paid as a cash allowance 
following the end of the year to which the payment relates. However , 
to facilitate higher levels of executive share ownership, the bonus may , 
at the director' s option and subject to the committee' s agreement, be 
in the form of options over company shares of equivalent value instead 
of cash payment. The vesting is deferred for three months during 
which it is forfeit if the individual is a bad leaver . Such options have 
a six-month exercise window.
The committee has discretion to amend performance measures 
and targets or adjust bonus payouts to take account of exceptional 
items, unbudgeted acquisitions or disposals, and other aspects 
of performance which have not been specifically identified in 
the targets.
The maximum opportunity is 150 per cent of annual 
salary for the Chief Executive and 125 per cent for 
other executive directors (including the additional  
stretch element). AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 63

the effective date of this policy but arising from commitments entered into prior to the effective date of the new policy , 
or at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the company .

Share Plan 
Incentivises directors to achieve 
long-term value creation and

to shareholders.
Annual awards of restricted shares or nil-cost options (with an 
18-month exercise period after vesting). Part of the award (the 
matched award) is conditional on the individual electing to lodge 
AMEC shares they beneficially own (investment shares) which are 
then held for the three years to vesting and is awarded in proportion  
to the number of investment shares on a ratio determined by the 
remuneration committee at the time of each award. These shares 
count towards satisfying the requirements of the shareholding 
guidelines, details of which are set out on page 76.
The basic award is subject to EPS growth and relative TSR measured 
over a three-year period with equal weighting on each measure. The 
matched award is subject to the same EPS measure only . Additionally , 
awards are subject to a provision that allows the committee to reduce 
vesting in the event that the accounts for any year over which the 
shares were earned are required to be restated for a correction of a 
prior period error . There is further provision to reduce leaver awards 
retrospectively on an individual basis as set out on page 67. 
The number of shares vesting from these awards is increased to take 
account of reinvested dividends during the performance period.
The committee will determine the applicable EPS range for each 
set of awards, with 25 per cent of the relevant portion of the awards 
vesting if the bottom of the range is achieved and 100 per cent if the 
top is achieved, with straight line vesting between. EPS is adjusted for 
certain defined items and calculated on a consistent basis between 
base and final years. 
The committee will determine the TSR comparator group for each 
set of awards with 25 per cent of the relevant portion of the awards 
vesting if AMEC's ranking is at median and 100 per cent if it is at 
upper quartile, with straight line vesting between. The committee 
has discretion not to vest the TSR portion if it is not satisfied that 
there has been sustained financial growth over the period.
The committee may amend the performance conditions if an 
event happens which the committee considers to be of a genuine, 
exceptional nature so that amended performance condition(s) would 
be a fairer measure of performance and would be neither easier nor 
more difficult to satisfy .
In the event of a change of control, awards will normally vest to the 
extent that the performance conditions have been met at that time. 
The committee has discretion to measure performance based solely 
against one of the performance conditions or to agree an exchange 
of awards instead of immediate vesting.
Award of shares with a face value at the time  
of award of up to 250 per cent of annual salary  
(ignoring dividend equivalents).
Sharesave Provides alignment with 
shareholders' interests.
Sharesave is an employee share plan under which discounted options 
over AMEC shares are granted linked to a savings arrangement. 
The exercise price can be up to a 20 per cent discount to the share 
price at the time of offer and the number of shares is that which can 
be bought at the exercise price with the expected proceeds of the 
savings contract. Executive directors are eligible to participate in this 
plan on the same basis as other employees in the country in which 
they are located. Invitations to participate may be made annually . 
Sharesave is not subject to performance conditions as the terms 
of the plan are subject to tax legislation in the UK and certain 
other countries including the US that preclude this. 
The maximum monthly savings level under any 
concurrent Sharesave plans is in line with the limit 
set by the UK government from time to time for such 
plans (currently  250 per month or the equivalent in 
other currencies). 
Chairman and non executive directors 
Note: The remuneration of non-executive directors is set by the Chairman and Chief Executive under delegated authority from 
the board rather than by the remuneration committee
Fees T o attract and retain individuals with 
the personal attributes, skills and 
experience required to determine 
strategy and governance, to apply 
executive oversight and to represent 
shareholders' interests.
Non-executive directors receive only fees for their services and do 
not participate in any of the incentive or benefit schemes of the group. 
Fee structure comprises a base fee and additional fees to reflect time 
commitment and responsibility of specific roles (SID and committee 
chair). Additional fees may also be paid to directors not resident in the 
UK to recognise the additional travelling time in attending meetings.
Increases in the Chairman's fee will not normally exceed 
the average increase awarded to executive directors. 
The company's articles currently set an aggregate limit 
of  600,000 for base fees for non-executive directors. 
T otal fees will not exceed market norms.

Selection of performance targets
Financial performance targets under the annual bonus plan are set so that the target level of bonus is paid normally for 
achieving the company's short-range plan. T o achieve maximum bonus, higher targets have to be met. In determining 
targets, the committee takes account of the general business circumstances including the perceived difficulty inherent in 
the short-range plan and the need to balance stretch against risk. The additional stretch bonus is subject to a profit target 
and only begins to be earned for performance that exceeds the maximum target that applies to other executives. Profit is 
chosen as the most appropriate measure of the company's short-term performance and the cash measures are chosen 
both to reflect the conversion of profit to cash and the management of cash flow across the year . AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 65

Overview Strategic report Governance Financials 
Policy on notice and payment for loss of office
Newly appointed executive directors will be employed on contracts that include the following provisions:
   
The individual will be required to give six months' notice if they wish to leave and the company will give up to 12 months' 
notice of termination other than for gross misconduct or other circumstances where employment may be terminated 
without notice 
   
At the company's discretion, the individual may be placed on garden leave for some or all of the period between the 
giving of notice and termination in which case the company will continue to pay salary and benefits for the garden leave 
period but will not make new share or other incentive awards
   
At any time, at the company's discretion, employment may be terminated before the end of the required notice period 
by making a payment in lieu of the balance and subject to mitigation as described more fully in the table below.
In the event of long-term incapacity , employment would not normally be terminated so long as the executive was entitled 
to payments under the company's group income protection insurance arrangements but the executive would be required 
to stand down from their role and as a director . 
Payment for loss of office will be determined according to the following principles set out below and, for the current 
executive directors, having regard to their existing contractual terms as described following the table.
Notice The executive will receive base salary , pension and other benefits for any part of the notice period worked (and any 
period of garden leave). On termination, the executive will be entitled to payment for any accrued but untaken 
holiday pay . 
The company may elect to pay a sum in lieu of notice for all or any part of the notice period, calculated by reference 
to the value of salary , pension and other contractual benefits (excluding bonus). In determining the payments to be 
made and the structure of such payments, the company will have regard to the executive's ability to mitigate their 
loss. In respect of any defined benefit pension rights, an augmentation of benefits for the relevant part of the notice 
period may be made. The committee has discretion to continue to provide certain benefits to the end of the notice 
period rather than including them in the payment in lieu.
Where the employment is being terminated by the company for gross misconduct (or other circumstances 
entitling the company to treat the contract as at an immediate end) termination will be immediate and no  
payment in lieu of notice will be made.
Annual  
bonus 
No bonus will be paid in the event of termination for gross misconduct.
In all other circumstances, the committee will consider whether it is appropriate to make a bonus payment for the 
year in question taking into account all relevant circumstances, including performance and conduct. Payment will 
usually be determined and paid in cash at the normal time. 
Deferred 
bonus from 
prior years
Deferred bonus will be forfeit in the event of termination for gross misconduct.
In the case of death it will be paid in full to the estate as soon as practicable thereafter . 
In other circumstances, it may be paid at the normal time at the committee' s discretion depending on the 
circumstances of termination.
Performance 
Share Plan
All unvested awards will lapse on leaving in the event of termination for gross misconduct or other  bad leaver' 
circumstances and any investment shares will be released. An example of a  bad leaver' would be an individual 
resigning in order to take up a position with a competitor .
Awards will immediately vest in full in the event of death. 
In other cases, unvested basic awards will be pro-rated for service, which may include any period for which payment 
was made in lieu. Provided the associated investment shares remain lodged, matched awards will normally 
be retained in full unless the committee decide to pro-rate for service. A further reduction may be made at the 
committee's discretion to take account of relevant circumstances at the time of leaving. The retained awards will 
vest in the normal way , taking account of the relevant performance conditions, and at the normal time subject to 
the committee being satisfied at that time that the individual remains a good leaver . AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 68
Other Redundancy pay in line with statutory provisions or those applying to employees generally in the country in which 
the director is based will be provided in the event of termination due to redundancy .
The cost of legal, tax or other advice incurred by the individual in connection with the termination and/or support 
with seeking alternative employment may be met up to a maximum of  100,000.
Additional payments may be made where required to settle legal disputes or as consideration for new or amended 
post-employment restrictions.
Where an individual is in receipt of relocation or expatriation benefits, the costs of actual expenses incurred in 
relation to any arrangements that are subject to term contracts may continue to be reimbursed for up to six 
months or , at the company's discretion, a one-off payment made to cover the costs of premature cancellation. 
The cost of repatriation will also be covered where this was part of the original expatriation terms.
Sharesave options lapse unless the director leaves because of specified good leaver reasons in which case 
they can be exercised for a limited period, to the extent of savings made to the date of exercise.
Samir Brikho and Ian McHoul are both employed under contracts (dated April 2007 and September 2008 respectively) with 
notice periods of twelve months from the company and which require them to give six months ' notice of resignation. The 
contracts permit for payment to be made in lieu of all or part of the required notice period at the company' s discretion but 
there is no prescribed methodology for calculating such payment in lieu or applying mitigation. Should circumstances 
arise where notice is given and the executive is not required to work all or part of the notice period, the terms of the 
existing contracts would be honoured. The individuals may be placed on garden leave for part of the notice period in which 
case the committee may determine that it is appropriate to pay an element of bonus for that garden leave period.
Existing directors' service contracts
The notice provisions for Samir Brikho and Ian McHoul are described above. There are no specified  
change-of-control provisions. 
The Chairman' s engagement may be terminated on six months' notice on either side. 
The contracts of non-executive directors may be terminated by the individual at any time. There are no specific 
provisions for compensation in the event of early termination by the company . As noted on page 80, our practice is that 
all directors submit themselves for re-election on an annual basis, in line with the recommendations in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in company and shareholder views
Our approach to the annual review of base salaries is to take account of personal performance, company performance, 
and pay levels more broadly within the company . The increases for 2014 are within the range of increases awarded to 
AMEC staff in the UK generally . External benchmarking is also taken into account, particularly for new appointments.
Any proposals to change remuneration policy are considered against the  best practice' guidelines produced by shareholder 
bodies and major shareholders are consulted directly when formulating any proposals for significant changes. The committee 
did consider these guidelines as well as representations made by certain individual shareholders in formulating its policy . 
There was no direct consultation with employees.
The Chairman of the company and the Chairman of the remuneration committee make themselves available at any time 
and also at each annual general meeting to discuss any issues raised. 
Differences in policy for directors compared to other employees
The structure of remuneration for executive directors is in line with other senior management. The primary differences 
compared to other employees are the structure of variable pay , which for senior management is in the form of 
performance-related incentives and for other employees is largely in the form of overtime and allowances reflecting 
the different emphases of the roles, and in the level of accrual under defined benefit arrangements.

Annual bonus measures and targets
The annual bonus plan will operate in much the same way as in 2013 and will be consistent with the policy described 
above. The following bonus measures and their weightings (maximum opportunity as a percentage of base salary) have 
been agreed for 2014. They reflect a range of financial and strategic measures that support the key strategic objectives of 
the company .

2014 targets against these measures are commercially sensitive and may be subject to revision so have not been disclosed. 
They will be disclosed retrospectively in next year' s report to the extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive at 
that time.
Long term incentive awards to be made in 2014
The Performance Share Plan will operate in the manner described in the policy set out above. The measures and their 
associated targets will be as follows:
Measure Threshold (25% vesting) Maximum (100% vesting)
TSR ranking Median Upper Quartile
EPS CAGR 5% 10%
The above EPS targets will be adjusted to reflect the proposed acquisition of Foster Wheeler AG, assuming it proceeds. 
The TSR comparator group will be the same as for the 2013 awards described on page 74. The matching ratio is two 
for one. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 70

Illustrations of application of policy 
The total remuneration for each of the executive directors that could result from the proposed remuneration policy in 2014 
under three different performance levels is shown below.

Notes
1   Fixed pay is base salary for 2014 plus the value of pension and benefits. The value of pension and benefits in kind is taken from the single total 
figure of remuneration for 2013.
2  On target performance is the level of performance required to deliver 66.67 per cent of the maximum annual bonus excluding the additional 
stretch element and 50 per cent of the full PSP award.
3  Maximum performance would result in the maximum bonus payment including the additional stretch element and 100 per cent vesting of 
PSP award.
4  PSP values ignore any change in share price or dividend equivalents.
 
Changes to Chairman' s and non executive directors' fees
The fee for the Chairman has been increased from 1 January 2014 in line with the percentage increases awarded

 Other strategic objectives' measures for the Chief Executive included actions to embed the new geographic structure, 
accelerate the development of activity in the Growth Regions, grow through acquisition, achieve appropriate settlements 
and cost savings, and safety leadership. For the CFO they included development and implementation of shared services 
and IT systems, achieving cost savings and delivering performance from the Investment Services activities. The committee 
has discretion to take other factors into account and uses its judgement in determining the amount to be paid under this item.
None of the bonus earned for 2013 is subject to compulsory deferral, as the EBIT A additional stretch minimum target 
was not met. 
The original EBIT A targets were adjusted to remove a provision for contribution from small acquisitions, following a change 
of priorities.
Performance Share Plan
The L TIP amount shown in the 2013   single total figure of remuneration' on page 71 is the award made under the 
Performance Share Plan in 2011. Vesting does not take place until April 2014 and is subject to two performance conditions 
each measured over three-year periods: (i) earnings per share (EPS*) growth between 2010 and 2013 and (ii) total 
shareholder return relative to a comparator group based on average share prices in the first quarter of 2014 compared 
to those in the corresponding period in 2011 (also subject to the committee being satisfied that there has been sustained 
financial growth of the company). The two performance conditions operate independently on different parts of the award: 
half of the basic award is dependent on EPS and the other half on TSR; the matched award depends solely on EPS.
*  EPS for this measure means the diluted earnings per share expressed to one decimal place of AMEC plc before goodwill and intangible 
amortisation, the charge or credits associated with executive share awards and exceptional items.  Real ' growth means in excess of the 
change in the UK Retail Prices Index for December 2013 compared to December 2010.
The committee took account of the share buyback that took place during 2012 and 2013 in determining the outcome for 
the EPS element. As the performance period for the TSR element has not yet been completed at the time of writing of this 
report, an estimated outcome has been used based on the average share price in the period 1 January to 31 January 2014. 
The performance achieved against the EPS target and the estimated TSR outcome are as follows:

Threshold -

The number of shares vesting based on the performance outcomes will be increased by 11.2 per cent to take account 
of reinvested dividends during the period from award to vesting. As the awards have not yet vested, the average share 
price in the final quarter of 2013 ( 11.19) has been applied to the estimated vesting percentage to determine the value

The actual vesting outcome and value may be different to this and will be confirmed in next year' s report. These awards 
were originally made as restricted shares but were amended during 2013 to be awards in the form of nil cost options with 
an 18-month exercise period post-vesting. If the option has not been exercised before the end of that period, it will be 
exercised automatically at that stage.
The L TIP amount shown in the 2012   single total figure of remuneration' on page 71 is the award made under the Performance 
Share Plan in 2010 that vested in April 2013. The performance measures for these awards were the same as for those 
made in 2011 but in this case the full award was subject to both EPS and TSR (each applying to half of the award) and 
there was no adjustment for reinvested dividends. The targets set and the outcomes against them were as follows:

of non-UK listed companies who are direct business competitors of AMEC and to exclude UK companies where there is 
little or no overlap in activities and comprised 28 companies including AMEC. Details of the specific companies included

Half of the basic award is subject to a TSR performance condition and the other half and all of the matched award is

The TSR measure is based on AMEC's ranking against the comparator group set out below based on the average share 
price over the final quarter of 2015 compared to the corresponding period in 2012. The threshold for any vesting to occur 
is that AMEC needs to be ranked at median or higher . If upper quartile ranking is achieved, full vesting will occur . Vesting 
is on a straight line basis between these threshold and maximum targets.

Overview Strategic report Governance Financials 
The EPS measure is based on the compound annual growth in excess of UK RPI (real CAGR) to 2015 from an adjusted 
2012 base of 85.7 pence. EPS for this purpose is defined as the diluted earnings per share expressed to one decimal place 
of AMEC plc before goodwill and intangible amortisation, the charge or credits associated with executive share awards and 
exceptional items (at the committee's discretion). The adjustment took account of the share buyback and an accounting 
standard change. Threshold (25 per cent) vesting will occur if real CAGR is 5 per cent and maximum (100 per cent) vesting 
will occur if real CAGR is 12 per cent or higher with straight line vesting for a result between these targets.
The number of shares vesting as determined by the performance conditions outcomes will be increased to take account 
of reinvested dividends including the UK tax credit in the period between award and vesting.
Payments to former directors
Apart from the 42,552 shares received by Neil Bruce under the PSP (referred to on page 73) no payments (including 
payments for loss of office) were made to former directors.

Percentage change in Chief Executive' s remuneration
The table below shows how the percentage change between 2012 and 2013 in the Chief Executive' s salary , benefits and 
bonus compares with the percentage change in the average of each of those elements of pay for a comparator group 
of employees. The committee has selected employees in the UK as the comparator group as they have broadly the 
same structure of remuneration and to eliminate the impact of exchange rate movements if employees in other 
countries were included.
Salary T axable benefits Bonus
2013 2012 % change 2013 2012 % change 2013 2012 % change
Chief Executive 927 900 +3% 66 42 +57% 717 769 -7%
UK staff +1% +11% -12%
As noted on page 71, Samir Brikho's 2013 taxable benefits figure includes an adjustment of circa  24,000 for prior years. The underlying change 
from 2012 to 2013 was 0%.
The year-on-year change for UK staff taxable benefits is based on data for tax years ending in 2013 and 2012 averaged over the number of 
employees in receipt of those benefits. The year-on-year changes for UK staff salary and bonus are based on the aggregate amounts paid 
in each year divided by the average number of employees in that year .
Relative importance of spending on pay 
The chart below illustrates the relative importance of spending on pay compared to distributions to shareholders 
(dividends and share buy-back) and other disbursements from profit or cash flow that are considered by the directors 
to be the most material expenditures in relation to the company's strategy .
