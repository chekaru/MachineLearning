Directors' remuneration report
This report sets out the policy and disclosures in relation to Directors' remuneration. At the Annual General Meeting of the company
to be held on 7 May 2003, this Directors' remuneration report will be submitted to shareholders for their approval. This Report ha s
been produced in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Composition and terms of reference of Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is responsible for determining the remuneration and the terms and conditions
of service of the Executive Directors. At the end of the year, the Committee was made up of seven independent Non-Executive
Directors. The membership of the Committee comprised Mr R D Lapthorne (the Chairman of the Board) as Chairman, Mr J Fr Odfjell
(the Deputy Chairman of the Board and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director), Mr D H Brydon, Prof E Thorsby,
Dr J S Patterson and Mr J F Rejeange. Prof M Uhl n joined the Committee in June 2002. The Chief Executive and the Human
Resources Director also attend the meetings of the Committee, except when their own remuneration is being considered.
Details of the Directors retiring by rotation at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 7 May 2003 are given in the Report
of the Directors on page 38. Of the Directors retiring, Prof M Uhl n and Prof E Thorsby are members of the Remuneration
Committee. Following the Annual General Meeting, Mr R D Lapthorne will retire from the Board and Dr J S Patterson will assume
the role of Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
In 2002, the Board accepted all the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee without amendment.
Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is reviewed by the Chief Executive who makes recommendations to the Board.
The Board determines the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors within the limits set out in the Articles of Association.
The responsibilities of the role and the level of fees paid in UK organisations of a similar size and complexity to Amersham ar e
considered in setting remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors.
The Report of the auditors on the financial statements covers the disclosures contained in this report that are specified for aud it
by the Financial Services Authority.
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors
In determining the remuneration policy for Executive Directors, the Committee has considered a number of factors including:
- the importance of attracting, retaining and motivating management of the appropriate calibre to further the success of
the business;
- the linking of reward to both individual and business performance; and
- ensuring that the interests of the Directors are aligned with those of the shareholders.
To this end, the Remuneration Committee seeks to pay Executive Directors base salaries at a median level and incentives (in the
form of bonuses and long term option arrangements) at an upper quartile level when compared to compensation levels and packages
in other companies of comparable size and complexity, and also in companies in the same business sector. The total package is
aimed to lie between the median and upper quartile. For 2003, the Committee aims to target 50% of total package in the form of
fixed remuneration (base salary and benefits) and 50% performance-related remuneration (target annual bonus and Black-Scholes
value of annual share option awards). In 2002, the ratio was 55% fixed and 45% performance-related remuneration.
In 2002, the Remuneration Committee considered a valuation of all elements of Executive Directors' remuneration to ensure that it
was aware of the total remuneration within the company and its selected comparators. This valuation approach included the use of
the Black-Scholes option valuation technique for assessing the value of long term incentives. The same approach will be used in 2003.
In establishing this policy, the Committee has appointed independent consultants, New Bridge Street Consultants, who provide
advice on remuneration and share plans both for Executive Directors and the wider executive population. The Committee has also
appointed Watson Wyatt who provide advice on pensions both for Executive Directors and advice to the company as a whole.
Neither New Bridge Street Consultants nor Watson Wyatt provide any other services to the company. In addition, the Committee
is advised on reward strategy by Mr Malcolm Saffin, Vice President of Compensation and Benefits for Amersham.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the policy adopted in its remuneration of Executive Directors and senior managers
has contributed to the sustained financial success and long term growth of the company. This policy has enabled the company
both to attract and keep a high calibre management team - essential for a well run and growing business. The strong shareholder
returns achieved by the company are a testament to this policy, which reflects best market practice. This policy will continue
to be reviewed in the light of changes in market practice and legislation, which impact upon the company.
The current elements of the remuneration packages can be summarised as follows:
Base salary and benefits
Base salaries for Executive Directors are reviewed by the Committee, normally annually, having regard to competitive market
practice and individual performance for the financial year.
The general benefits provided to the Executive Directors are a fully-expensed car, pension, life, disability and health insurance
and where appropriate relocation expenses. Annual performance-related bonus
The annual performance-related bonus is dependent upon a number of factors. The level of bonus is payable on a sliding scale
between 0% and 100% of the base salary. Bonus payments totalling  1,135,930 (2001 -  1,125,420) have been achieved, based
on the financial performance measures attained for 2002, namely sales and operating profit, cash flow, growth in earnings per
share and performance against a number of personal objectives for each Executive Director. In addition, the company has agreed
to pay Mr P Loescher an amount equivalent to the bonus he would have received from his previous company had he not joined
Amersham. The precise amount is not yet known, but is expected to lie within the range of euros 300,000 to euros 650,000.
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2003, it is proposed to pay a bonus on a sliding scale of 0% to 150% of base salary.
The actual payment will be based on the same financial performance measures as used in 2002. Two-thirds of the bonus shall be
paid in cash and one-third in the form of restricted shares, which will vest 50% on the second anniversary of the bonus payment
date and 50% on the third anniversary of the bonus payment date.
In conjunction with the increased annual bonus opportunity, the company has introduced Share Ownership guidelines, which will
require the Executive Directors to hold shares equivalent in value to two times their base salary. This holding must be acquired
within five years.
Share option schemes
T ax approved and unapproved Executive Share Option Schemes (ESOS) are available to Executive Directors and senior managers.
Options granted to Executive Directors prior to 2001 under the terms of the 1993 Executive Share Option Scheme are subject
to the attainment of growth in the group's earnings per share of at least 6% more than the increase in the Retail Prices Index
over any three consecutive financial years prior to the exercise of the option.
Options granted to Executive Directors from 2001 under the terms of the 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme are not normally
exercisable until the third anniversary of the date of grant and to the extent that the performance conditions specified prior t o
the grant of the option have been satisfied. For options granted to Executive Directors in 2001 and 2002 (which are detailed in
the Interests in share options table on page 49), 50% of each option grant will vest if the company's normalised earnings per
share growth (as determined by the Remuneration Committee) matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 
3% per annum. The entire option grant will vest if the company's normalised earnings per share growth matches or exceeds the
growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 5% per annum. There is proportionate vesting between 3% and 5%. Performance is always
measured from the end of the financial year prior to the grant of the option. 25% of the options may vest after one year with 
a further 25% after two years and a further 50% after three years. To the extent that these targets are not achieved by those
times, the performance period will be extended, one financial year at a time. To the extent that the performance conditions have
not been met by the fifth anniversary of the grant, the option lapses. Option grants made to Dr A Carr in 2001 and 2002 are not
subject to performance conditions as he was not an Executive Director at the date of grant. Option grants made to all Executive
Directors in 2003 are subject to the same performance conditions as applied to Executive Director option grants in 2001 and 200 2.
Although performance conditions are not a common feature of option plans operated by our international competitors, we recognise
that as a company with our primary listing in the UK, it is appropriate that options granted to our Executive Directors are subj ect
to performance conditions. The performance conditions we have chosen mean that options will only vest when there has been
a correspondingly good return for our shareholders. More demanding performance conditions would mean that the Black-Scholes
valuation of share options awarded would be lower and therefore in order to maintain the same Black-Scholes value of award,
higher option grants would need to be given.
The beneficial interests of the Executive Directors in share options are shown on page 49.
The following graph shows the value by the end of 2002 of  100 invested in Amersham on 31 December 1997 compared with
the value of  100 invested in the FTSE 100 index. Amersham has been a constituent of this index for most of this period and
therefore this index is deemed to be the most appropriate comparator.
Executive Directors are also entitled to participate in the UK Inland Revenue approved Sharesave (SAYE) share option scheme
which is available to all UK employees. The scheme is subject to a cumulative maximum investment of  250 per month for each
individual. The share option runs for three, five or seven years. At the end of the chosen period the shares may be purchased by
the employee at a 20 per cent discount to the share price at the start of the period.

Pensions
Sir William Castell is entitled to a total target pension upon retirement at age 60 of 60% of the average of the last three yea rs'
basic salary. The pension payable by the company will be this target pension, less pension benefits earned in previous
employments. This pension will also include the pension which could be notionally secured by Sir William Castell from past
remuneration supplements.
Approximately two-thirds of the total target pension is being funded, through a combination of approved and unapproved
arrangements. With effect from December 2002, this proportion will be increased over time with the objective that at retirement,
the whole of the target pension will be funded. Details of the accrual of his pension are provided below.
Mr G W Battersby, Mr G F B Kerr and Mr P Loescher accrue pension benefits through a combination of approved defined benefit
arrangements and unapproved defined contribution arrangements. Dr J M Padfield also accrued pension benefits through a
combination of approved defined benefit arrangements and unapproved defined contribution arrangements up to his retirement
on 31 December 2002. Details are shown below of the defined benefit accrual. The contribution to the Funded Unapproved
Retirement Benefits Scheme ( FURBS') element is identified in the column headed  pension contributions' in the table on page 47.
Dr A Carr accrues a defined benefit pension through both UK and US pension arrangements.
In previous years' accounts, disclosures of the accrual of defined benefits have been made under the requirements of the
Stock Exchange Listing Rules. These Rules are still in place, but it is now also necessary to make disclosure in accordance with
the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. The information below sets out the disclosures under the two sets
of requirements.

Notes:
1 The accrued pensions are the amounts which would be paid if the Director left service at the relevant date, but ignoring any vesting periods.
2 The transfer value represents the lump sum capital value of the Director's pension benefits as at the year end, calculated using assumptions certified by our actuary in accordance with actuarial guidance
note GN11 published by the Institute of Actuaries and Faculty of Actuaries. These assumptions include a link to current stockmarket levels for younger members and bond markets for older members.
Stockmarkets have fallen during the year and the transfer values for younger Directors have fallen accordingly.

Service contracts
Each of the Executive Directors is employed on a rolling contract subject to one year's notice if given by the company and
six months' notice if given by the Executive Director. This notice period was reduced in 2002 from two years and new
service contracts have been entered into as follows:
Director Employing company Date of contract
W M Castell Amersham plc 1 March 2002
G W Battersby Amersham plc 1 March 2002
A Carr Amersham Biosciences UK Limited 16 December 2002
G F B Kerr Amersham plc 1 March 2002
P Loescher Amersham plc 1 December 2002
The Committee believes that in order to attract Executive Directors of the right calibre and to compete for talent with our
competitors, it is necessary to offer service contracts with notice periods of one year, which explicitly set out the provisions
relating to termination of the contract.
Under the terms of the Executive Directors' service contracts, on termination of employment by the company, except in the
case of dismissal for cause, the company shall make a payment to the Executive Director equal to 95% of:
a) the Executive's basic salary for the period of notice,
b) the cost of provision of pension and benefits for the notice period and
c) the bonus applicable for the notice period, based on the actual bonus paid in the previous three years.
Such payment shall be reduced proportionately in the event that the Executive works part of his period of notice. When the
company has given notice of termination, such payment shall be made within three months of the date of notice. Any payment
shall be entirely discretionary when the Executive has given notice of termination. In the event that the employment is
terminated for any other reason, such payment shall be made forthwith. There are no special provisions in the event of a change
of control of the company except for Mr Battersby. In the event of a change of control of the company, which leads to Mr Battersb y
leaving the company within a period of 12 months following such change of control, the pension element of the Agreed Payment
detailed above may be enhanced by up to five years' contributions. This enhancement shall reduce progressively to zero by 2008
and was agreed at the time of his recruitment.
On 31 December 2002, Dr J M Padfield retired from the Board in order to facilitate succession planning. He received a payment 
of  841,035 in respect of his contractual entitlements, comprising 95% of the total of his salary ( 390,000), bonus ( 300,300),
pension benefits ( 156,000) and other benefits ( 39,000). These figures are included in the remuneration table and notes on 
page 47.
During the year, Mr P Loescher joined the company from Japan. The costs of his relocation, his housing and his children's education
are being met by the company in line with the company's expatriate policy. In addition, he received a signing-on bonus of
euros 500,000 ( 316,455). All amounts are disclosed in the Directors' remuneration table on page 47. The company has agreed to
compensate Mr Loescher for the loss of the bonus he would have received from his previous company had he not joined Amersham.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial period of three years, subject to subsequent renewal by agreement. Details 
of when each Director was appointed are shown in the Directors' biographies on pages 36 to 37. There are no compensation
provisions for early termination of Non-Executive Director appointments. Amersham plc 47

Restricted shares
On 4 December 2002, 77,320 restricted shares were awarded to P Loescher on his joining the company. 50% of these shares vest
on 4 December 2004 and the remaining 50% vest on 4 December 2005, subject to his still being an employee of the company.
The share price on the date of the award was  5.69. The shares for the award to P Loescher will be supplied by the Amersham
ESOP Trust. The Remuneration Committee concluded that such awards were necessary to recruit P Loescher and therefore,
the committee made such an award relying on the exemption in chapter 13.13A of the UKLA Listing Rules. In the event that
P Loescher ceases to be employed by the company, his awards will lapse unless the Remuneration Committee determine
otherwise, except in the circumstances of his death, when his personal representatives may exercise his awards. The Remuneration
Committee will not make amendments to the arrangements established for P Loescher that are to his advantage, without seeking
the consent of shareholders. No benefits under the arrangements are pensionable. Directors' remuneration report
