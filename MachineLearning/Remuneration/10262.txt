The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the  Committee') has
responsibility for making recommendations to the Board 
on the Company's general policy on remuneration and 
also determines specific packages for individual Directors. 
It carries out the policy on behalf of the Board.
The present members of the Committee are 
The Rt Hon the Lord Patten, who is Chairman, Mr J A Biles
and Mr G F Page. None of them has any personal financial
interest in any of the matters to be decided (other than as
shareholders), potential conflicts of interest arising from
cross-directorships or any day-to-day involvement in the
running of the business. There were 11 Committee meetings
in the financial year. The Board recognises that Directors'
remuneration is a legitimate concern to shareholders and 
is striving to follow current best practice. The Company
operates in a competitive environment and its performance
depends on the individual contribution of the Directors and
employees and it believes in rewarding vision and innovation.
Policy on Executive Directors' remuneration
The policy of the Board is to provide executive remuneration
packages designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors
of the calibre necessary to maintain the Group's position 
as a market-leader and to reward them for enhancing
shareholder value and return. The remuneration should also
reflect the Directors' responsibilities and contain incentives to
deliver the Company's objectives. The Committee consults
the Group Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer about
their proposals relating to the remuneration of other
Executive Directors. The Committee has access to
professional advice inside and outside the Company.
The Company appointed and the Committee took 
advice from the Monks Partnership in determining 
executive remuneration. 
The Committee has decided that it should in future select
and appoint advisers and these should report directly to 
the Committee. It has appointed Watson Wyatt for future
remuneration advice with effect from 24 September 2002. 
Mercer Human Resource Consulting were appointed by 
the Company and provide advice on executive pensions.
They are also actuaries to the Amey Pension Scheme and
Amey OS Pension Scheme.
There are five main elements of executive remuneration:
  basic salary;
  pensions and life assurance;
  annual performance related bonus;
  share option incentives;
  deferred annual bonus plan.
The Committee believes that the proportion of fixed and
variable pay is appropriate and that a significant proportion
of Executive Directors' remuneration depends on individual
and Company performance. This proportion is similar for all
executives. Base salary for an Executive Director is less than
half the overall package value where all targets are met.
Basic salary
In deciding upon appropriate levels of remuneration the
Committee seeks independent professional advice and has
regard to rates of pay for similar positions in comparable
companies as well as individual and Group performance. 
Salaries are based on market comparisons for each post
based on business support services and industrial and
services companies of a similar turnover. A notional salary
range of minus 15% to plus 20% of market median is
applied. The Director's position within these ranges is based
on both short and longer term personal performance and
relevant experience. 
Directors' salaries are reviewed on the above basis in April,
subject to a minimum increase equal to the percentage
increase in the latest figure available of the All Items Retail
Prices Index. 
Pensions and life assurance
The Amey Executive Pension Scheme (the  Pension
Scheme') has two sections. One provides a defined 
benefit pension, the other a defined contribution pension.
Under the defined benefit section, the pension is accrued 
at one forty-fifth of pensionable salary for each year of
pensionable service. Members of the defined contribution
section will receive a pension dependent upon the amount
of contributions and the investment return over the period 
to retirement. Executive Directors are provided with a death
in service benefit of four times salary.
During the year ended 31 December 2002, all Executive
Directors of the Group employed, with the exception of 
Mr C M Mogg, Mr J H Robinson and Mr M A Kayser 
who had private pension arrangements, were members 
of the Pension Scheme. Mr R W Entwistle, Mr M Ewell, 
Mr D J Miller and Mr R C Osborne participated in the
defined benefit section. Mr B L Staples participated in the
defined contribution section.
Under the defined contribution scheme, a contribution
based on basic salary is paid by the Company on behalf of
each Executive Director which varies in accordance with
each Executive Director's service agreement. The highest
contribution level paid on behalf of a particular Director under
the Pension Scheme or private pension arrangements in
respect of the period ended 31 December 2002 was 30%.
To the extent that an Executive Director's benefits from 
the Pension Scheme are restricted by Inland Revenue 
limits, individual alternative arrangements are in place 
(details of which are set out on pages 22 and 23).
The pension costs of Directors are charged over their
estimated working lives based on actuarial advice. Details of
the pension benefits which accrued during the year to the
Executive Directors under the Pension Scheme are set out
on page 23 in a separate table. Service as a Non-Executive
Director is not pensionable.
Annual Performance Related Bonus 
An Annual Performance Related Bonus (the  Annual Bonus')
is payable in each financial year to Executive Directors of the
Company. The Committee establishes the objectives which
must be met for a bonus to be paid. The Committee
believes that the award of any annual bonuses should be
tied to the interests of the Company's shareholders and 
that the principal measure of those interests is shareholder
value. Maximum bonus opportunities are again based 
on market comparisons with business support services 
and industrial services companies of a similar turnover.
Outstanding performance would result in total cash at 
an upper quartile level. The maximum Annual Bonus that 
can be paid is 60% of basic annual salary.
The Committee has unfettered discretion to look at the
amount awarded but has agreed in relation to the Annual
Bonus the following guiding principles:
  Real growth in profit each year should be a pre-condition
for reward.
  Targets should recognise the need for return on capital
each year to exceed the cost of capital.
  Clear and challenging targets should be in place and
communicated for all incentive plans.
Report on Directors' remuneration 20 Amey plc
In respect of the Annual Bonus for the year ended
31 December 2002 targets were set for: relative total
shareholder return, earnings per share growth, operational
cash flow delivery and individual performance targets. 
No Annual Bonus will be payable to Executive Directors in 
respect of 2002 performance.
Share option incentives 
The Company operates a 1994 Inland Revenue Approved
Executive Share Option Scheme (the  Approved Executive
Scheme') and a 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme (the
 Unapproved Executive Scheme') (both such schemes
together called the  Executive Schemes'). Options may be
granted at the discretion of the Committee. 
The Committee has established a policy on the conditions
for the granting and exercise of options under the Executive
Schemes and has agreed the principle that long-term
incentives (share options and the Deferred Annual Bonus
Plan) should be directly aligned with shareholder value by
virtue of appropriate performance conditions.
Participation in the Executive Schemes requires the
recommendation of the Group HR Director who will take 
into account both labour market needs and the level of 
the employee in the Group, as determined by a banding
process. Factors considered by the Committee when
making an award include performance, potential and level 
in the organisation of the employee. 
For senior executives, grants of options are phased over a
period of time and not made in one tranche. The maximum
award under the rules of the Schemes to any individual 
is four times earnings (i.e. annual salary and annual bonus)
and this limit was applied to Mr B L Staples. However for all
other Executive Directors it has been capped at four times
basic salary. Lower maximum limits are in operation for the
different bands of executives below Board level. 
Options may normally be exercised between the third and
tenth anniversary of the date of grant, conditional upon the
earnings per share of the Company increasing by not less
than 5% per annum (7% in the case of Executive Directors)
above the increase in RPI over a period of three years.  
The EPS condition was chosen to ensure that appreciation
in the value of options is in line with the creation of
shareholder value. 
The Company also operates a 1994 Savings Related Share
Option Scheme (the  SAYE Scheme'), in which all full-time
employees in all participating companies in the Group are
invited to participate. Options may be exercised in the period
of six months commencing on the first bonus date. The limit
on the aggregate number of shares that may be issued
under the rules of the Executive Schemes and the SAYE
Scheme is 15% of the issued share capital of the Company,
although for the two years up to 9 May 2002, the
Committee applied a lower limit of 12.5%, as approved by
the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2000.
The 15% limit would apply to the SAYE Scheme and the
Approved Executive Scheme until they expire on 7 June
2004 and, in the case of the Unapproved Executive
Scheme, would apply until that date, after which it would
revert back to 10%. 
Deferred Annual Bonus Plan 
The Deferred Annual Bonus Plan (the  Plan') comprises 
a discretionary trust, the Trustees of which are Jasmine
Trustees Limited, an independent trust company.
Participation is at the discretion of the Committee. 
A participating executive can elect to forfeit, as a maximum,
all of the bonus payable to him/her under the Annual Bonus
Scheme and an allocation of such number of Ordinary
shares of the Company ( bonus shares') will be made to
him/her, by reference to the market value of a share on the
day immediately before the award date. These bonus shares
are held in trust and vest automatically after a period of 
three years, unless a deferral is requested by the participant
and approved by the Trustees.
An additional allocation of Ordinary shares ( additional
shares') may be made to the executive in accordance with a)
an increase in real earnings per share over a three-year
period of not less than 2%, and b) the improvement in the
Company's total shareholder return (TSR) over a three-year
period compared to a list of comparator companies.
Currently the comparator companies are: Amec plc, 
Jarvis plc, WS Atkins plc, Aggreko plc, AEA Technology plc
and Serco Group plc. These measures were chosen to
ensure that scheme targets mirror shareholder interests and
the creation of shareholder value.
The Earnings Per Share target has to be met before any
additional shares are allocated. The number of additional
shares allocated (at the end of the three year period) is
calculated by the index resulting from dividing Amey's TSR
by that of the comparator group. One additional share is
given for each original bonus share when Amey's TSR
matches that of the group. The maximum award of
additional shares to any participant is two for each original
bonus share, when Amey's TSR is twice that of the group. 
A straight-line basis applies between these points.
The Committee has had limited discretion in applying 
the TSR index in exceptional circumstances. In 2002 the
EPS definition was altered to allow the Committee similar
discretion in exceptional circumstances. Discretion has 
not been exercised in either measure.
Total shareholder return 
The graphs below show the total shareholder return of Amey
plc for the five financial years ended 31 December 2002 as
shown against the total shareholder return of the FTSE 350
Index and the FTSE Support Services Index for the same
period. The Board believes that both the FTSE 350 Index
and the FTSE Support Services Index provide a broad equity
market index against which the performance of Amey plc
can be fairly compared, and that the FTSE Support Services
Index provides a particularly representative sample of
comparator companies.
Report on Directors'
remuneration 21 Amey plc
Report on Directors'
remuneration
Directors' contracts 
In compliance with the Combined Code, Executive Directors
have rolling 12-month contracts under which the Company,
in the event of termination by it without giving 12-months'
notice would be obliged to pay damages for the unexpired
portion of the contract if it is terminated early (subject to the
normal principles of mitigation of loss), but no compensation
would be payable in the event of the contract being
terminated by the Executive Director or for lawful early
termination by the Company. Company practice is to make
staged payments.
The Executive Directors' service agreements began on the 
following dates: 
Mr R W Entwistle - 18 August 1999.
Mr M Ewell - 1 September 2001.
Mr C M Mogg - 1 January 2000.
Mr B L Staples - 19 November 1997 
(resigned on 28 February 2003).
Unless terminated earlier, each Executive Director's service
agreement automatically terminates on the Director's 
65th birthday.
Executive Directors are required to obtain prior Board
approval before taking up any appointment from sources
outside the Company and the Board will on a case-by-case
basis consider whether any payment relating to such
appointment may be retained. None of the current three
Executive Directors (Mr M Ewell, Mr R W Entwistle or 
Mr C M Mogg) has an external appointment. During the last
financial year, Mr B L Staples held two external appointments
and retained the fees relating to these appointments.
Non-Executive Directors do not have contracts of service:
they are appointed to the Board for an initial fixed period of
three years, which may be extended at the discretion of the
Board, subject to rotation under the Articles of Association
and to Companies Act provisions relating to the removal 
of Directors. 
In respect of the Directors proposed for re-election at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting, Sir Ian Robinson does
not have a service contract, Mr R W Entwistle has a service
contract with a notice period of 12 months.
Non-Executive Directors 
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is
determined by the Board within the limits set out in the
Articles of Association. 
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is reviewed in
line with market practice every 24 months. Remuneration
was reviewed in 2002 and no increases were made other
than in respect of Mr J A Biles and The Rt Hon the Lord
Patten, whose fees as chairmen of the Audit Committee and
Remuneration Committee respectively were increased by
 3,000 per annum each, with effect from 1 April 2002. 
Non-Executive Directors cannot participate in any of the
Company's Annual Bonus Scheme, Executive Schemes,
SAYE Scheme or the Plan and are not eligible to join the
Pension Scheme.
Details of Directors' remuneration 
Full details of all elements of the remuneration package of
each Director and details of Directors' share interests and
share options are given on pages 22 to 25, which form part
of this Report on Directors' remuneration.

money purchase scheme, as Mr B L Staples was a fully contributed member in both years.
(2) Defined benefit pension scheme (see table on page 23).
(3) On his resignation as Chairman in the year ended 31 December 2001, Mr N Ashley was employed by Amey Construction
Limited on a part-time basis on  20,000 per annum and received  20,000 (2001:  13,424) under the terms of his
employment for the year ended 31 December 2002. This employment ends on 8 May 2003. In addition, Mr N Ashley
received  49,898 (2001:  49,898) as the second of five equal annual instalments in respect of his Unfunded Unapproved
Retirement Benefits Scheme entitlement.
(4) In respect of both Mr C M Mogg and Mr J H Robinson, the Company has undertaken to make a contribution of up 
to 25% (2001: 25%) of pensionable salary to personal pension plans. Mr J H Robinson was entitled to receive as salary 
the pension contribution normally payable in respect of his salary in excess of the earnings cap. In the year ended 
31 December 2002, Mr J H Robinson received such additional salary of  17,333 (2001:  25,438), which is disclosed within
the salary figure in the above table. In respect of Mr M A Kayser, the Company has undertaken to make a contribution of up
to 30% of pensionable salary to a personal pension scheme up to the pensions cap and a Funded Unapproved Retirement
Benefit Scheme (FURBS) for contributions over the pensions cap.
(5) On resigning as a Director, Mr D J Miller remained an employee until 31 December 2002 and received payments of
 77,458 in respect of that employment. On termination of his contract as an employee Mr D J Miller received  153,576 
for compensation for loss of office, of which  63,576 was in respect of buying out his Unfunded Unapproved Retirements
Benefits Scheme liability.
(6) On resigning as a Director, Mr M A Kayser remains as an employee until 16 October 2003 and received payments of
 64,077 in respect of that employment to 31 December 2002.

and not payable until 2003. 23 Amey plc
(8) Mr B L Staples resigned on 28 February 2003 and his compensation for loss of office was  361,036. His service
agreement provided for 12 months' notice but a compromise agreement was reached which reduced this to six months.
The total amount includes the following elements:  202,000 in lieu of salary during his notice period;  84,000 in lieu of
pension contribution/arrangements during his notice period; benefit in kind value, consideration for restrictive covenants,
and solicitors' costs totalling  40,036; and outplacement support up to  35,000. A number of these costs, including the
payment of  202,000 in lieu of salary, are subject to possible mitigation.
(9) Included in benefits are payments made for travel and associated costs for Directors whose principal place of employment
has changed to the Company' s offices in London. In the case of Mr B L Staples and Mr C M Mogg, their principal place of
employment was previously the Company' s head office at Sutton Courtenay. In the case of Mr R W Entwistle, his principal
place of employment was previously the Company' s office at Reading. Where these benefits result in a tax charge for the
Directors, the Company pays the Director an additional salary to compensate for this tax liability. 
(10) Mr J H Robinson was the highest paid Director in the year. 
(11) The 2001 comparative figure for contributions to the personal pension plan for Mr C M Mogg has been revised in 
the table on page 22 to reflect the retrospective change in contribution rate.
