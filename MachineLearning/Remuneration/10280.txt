 15 Amino Technologies plc Annual Report & Accounts 2005
INTRODUCTION
As a company listed on AIM, Amino T echnologies plc is not required to present a directors' remuneration report. However some 
voluntary disclosures have been given.
In framing its remuneration policy and the reporting of remuneration, the Committee has given consideration to the Combined Code.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee, chaired by Colin Smithers and including Nick Kuenssberg and Grant Masom, determines the 
Group's policy for executive remuneration and the individual remuneration packages for executive directors. In setting the 
Group's remuneration policy, the Committee considers a number of factors including the following:
   salaries and benefits available to executive directors of comparable companies;
   the need to both attract and retain executives of appropriate calibre; and
   the continued commitment of executives to the Group's development through appropriate incentive schemes.
REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Consistent with this policy, benefit packages awarded to executive directors comprise a mix of basic salary and performance-related 
remuneration that is designed as an incentive. 
The remuneration packages comprise the following elements:
   base salary: the Remuneration Committee sets base salaries to reflect responsibilities and the skills, knowledge and 
experience of the individual;
   bonus scheme: the executive directors are eligible to receive a bonus dependent on both individual and Group performance 
as determined by the Remuneration Committee; and
   car allowance: Company contribution into a personal pension scheme, life assurance, private medical insurance and 
permanent health insurance. 
The executive directors are engaged under separate contracts which require a notice period of six months given at any time by 
the Company or the individual.
REMUNERATION OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The fees paid to the non-executive directors are determined by the board. The non-executive directors do not receive any other 
forms of benefits such as health cover or pension. The notice periods of the non-executive chairman and non-executive directors 
are six months and three months respectively.
