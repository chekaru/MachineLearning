 13 Amino Technologies plc annual report and accounts 2006
Introduction
As a Company listed on AIM, Amino Technologies plc is not required to present a Directors' remuneration report, however, some voluntary disclosures 
have been made.
In framing its remuneration policy and the reporting of remuneration, the Committee has given consideration to the Combined Code (2003).
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, chaired by Keith Todd and including Colin Smithers and Olivier Hopkes, determines the Group's policy for executive 
remuneration and the individual remuneration packages for executive directors. In setting the Group's remuneration policy, the Committee considers 
a number of factors including the following:
  salaries and benefits available to executive directors of comparable companies;
  the need to both attract and retain executives of appropriate calibre; and
   the continued commitment of executives to the Group's development through appropriate incentive schemes (including the award of shares and 
share options).
Remuneration of executive directors
Consistent with this policy, benefit packages awarded to executive directors comprise a mix of basic salary and performance related remuneration that 
is designed as an incentive. 
The remuneration packages comprise the following elements:
  base salary: the Remuneration Committee sets base salaries to reflect responsibilities and the skills, knowledge and experience of the individual;
   bonus scheme: the executive directors are eligible to receive a bonus dependent on both individual and Group performance as determined by 
the Remuneration Committee;
   equity: shares and share options; and
  car allowance: Company contribution into a personal pension scheme, life assurance, private medical insurance and permanent health insurance. 
The executive directors are engaged under separate contracts which require a notice period of six months given at any time by the Company or  
the individual.
Remuneration of non-executive directors
The fees paid to the non-executive directors are determined by the Board. The non-executive directors do not receive any other forms of benefits such 
as health cover or pension. The notice periods of the non-executive Chairman and non-executive directors are three months.
