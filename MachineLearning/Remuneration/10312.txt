 15 Amino Technologies plc annual report and accounts 2007
Introduction
As a company listed on AIM, Amino Technologies plc is not required to present a Directors' remuneration report, however some 
voluntary disclosures have been made.
In framing its remuneration policy and the reporting of remuneration, the Committee has given consideration to the 
Combined Code (2006).
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, chaired by Keith T odd and including Colin Smithers, Andrew Burke and (subsequent to the year end) 
Peter Murphy, determines the Group's policy for executive remuneration and the individual remuneration packages for Executive Directors. 
In setting the Group's remuneration policy, the Committee considers a number of factors including the following:
  salaries and benefits available to Executive Directors of comparable companies;
  the need to both attract and retain executives of appropriate calibre; and
   the continued commitment of executives to the Group's development through appropriate incentive schemes (including the 
award of shares and share options).
Remuneration of Executive Directors
Consistent with this policy, benefit packages awarded to Executive Directors comprise a mix of basic salary and performance-related 
remuneration that is designed as an incentive. 
The remuneration packages comprise the following elements:
   base salary: the Remuneration Committee sets base salaries to reflect responsibilities and the skills, knowledge and experience 
of the individual;
   bonus scheme: the Executive Directors are eligible to receive a bonus dependent on both individual and Group performance 
as determined by the Remuneration Committee;
  equity: shares and share options; and
   car allowance, Company contribution into a personal pension scheme, life assurance, private medical insurance and 
permanent health insurance. 
The Executive Directors are engaged under separate contracts which require a notice period of six months given at any time 
by the Company or the individual.
Remuneration of Non-executive Directors
The fees and equity paid to the Non-executive Directors are determined by the Board. The Non-executive Directors do not 
receive any other forms of benefits such as health cover or pension. The notice periods of the Non-executive Chairman and 
Non-executive Directors are three months.
