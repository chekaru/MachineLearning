directors' remuneration report
Amino Technologies plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2011  |  12
introduction 
As a company listed on AIM, Amino Technologies plc is not required to present a directors' remuneration report, however a number of voluntary 
disclosures have been made. The company has complied with the disclosure requirements set out in the AIM Rules for Companies.
In framing its remuneration policy and the reporting of remuneration, the committee has given consideration to the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (June 2010).
r emuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee, chaired by Peter Murphy and including Colin Smithers, Keith Todd and Michael Bennett, determines the Group's 
policy for executive remuneration and the individual remuneration packages for executive directors.  In setting the Group's remuneration policy, 
the committee considers a number of factors including the following:
  Salaries and benefits available to executive directors of comparable companies;
  The need to both attract and retain executives of appropriate calibre; and
  The continued commitment of executives to the Group's development through appropriate incentive schemes (including the award of shares 
and share options).
r emuneration of executive directors 
Consistent with this policy, benefit packages awarded to executive directors comprise a mix of basic salary and performance-related remuneration 
that is designed as an incentive.      
The remuneration packages comprise the following elements:
  Base salary:  the Remuneration Committee sets base salaries to reflect responsibilities and the skills, knowledge and experience of the individual;
  Bonus scheme:  the executive directors are eligible to receive a bonus dependent on both individual and Group performance as determined by 
the Remuneration Committee;
  Equity: shares and share options; and
  Car allowance, company contribution into a personal pension scheme, life assurance, private medical insurance and permanent health 
insurance.     
The executive directors are engaged under separate contracts which require a notice period of six months given at any time by the Company or 
the individual.
r emuneration of non-executive directors 
The fees and equity paid to the non-executive directors are determined by the board. The non-executive directors do not receive any other forms 
of benefits such as health cover or pension. The notice periods of the non-executive chairman and non-executive directors are three months.
