Directors' remuneration report 
For the year ended 30 November 2013 
9   AMINO TECHNOLOGIES PLC 
Introduction 
 
As a company listed on AIM, Amino Technologies plc is not required to present a directors' remuneration report, 
however a number of voluntary disclosures have been made. The Company has complied with the disclosure 
requirements set out in the AIM Rules for Companies. 
In framing its remuneration policy and the reporting of remuneration, the committee has given consideration to the 
revised 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Remuneration Committee 
 
The Remuneration Committee, chaired by Peter Murphy and including Colin Smithers, Keith Todd and Michael 
Bennett, determines the Group's policy for executive remuneration and the individual remuneration packages for 
executive directors.  In setting the Group's remuneration policy, the committee considers a number of factors including 
the following: 
  salaries and benefits available to executive directors of comparable companies; 
  the need to both attract and retain executives of appropriate calibre; and 
  the continued commitment of executives to the Group's development through appropriate incentive schemes 
(including the award of shares and share options). 
Remuneration of executive directors 
 
Consistent with this policy, benefit packages awarded to executive directors comprise a mix of basic salary and 
performance-related remuneration that is designed as an incentive.    
The remuneration packages comprise the following elements: 
  base salary:  the Remuneration Committee sets base salaries to reflect responsibilities and the skills, 
knowledge and experience of the individual; 
  bonus scheme:  the executive directors are eligible to receive a bonus dependent on both individual and 
Group performance as determined by the Remuneration Committee; 
  equity: shares and share options; and 
  car allowance, company contribution into a personal pension scheme, life assurance, private medical 
insurance and permanent health insurance.   
The executive directors are engaged under separate contracts which require a notice period of six months given at 
any time by the Company or the individual.
