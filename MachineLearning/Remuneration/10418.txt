Report of the Board on Directors' Remuneration 
 
This report sets out the policy and disclosures in relation to Directors' Remuneration.  At the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company to be held on 24 November 2005, this report will be submitted to shareholders for 
their approval.  This report has been produced in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report 
Regulations 2002 which introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors' remuneration. 
 
Composition and terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the Company's remuneration policy and for determining the 
terms and conditions of service of the executive directors.  The Committee is chaired by Ms. M. R. Mountford 
and its other member is Mr. J. Samson, both of whom are independent non-executive directors.  The Chairman 
and Finance Director attend these meetings by invitation. 
 
Non-executive directors 
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is reviewed annually and is set by the Board.  The 
responsibilities of the role and the level of fees paid by similar sized companies are considered in setting the 
remuneration policy for non-executive directors. 
 
Remuneration policy for executive directors 
In framing its remuneration policy for executive directors, the Committee considers a number of factors 
including:- 
 
  the need to attract, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to ensure the Company is 
managed successfully for the benefit of shareholders; 
  the linking of remuneration to individual and business performance; and 
  ensuring that the interests of executive directors are in alignment with those of shareholders. 
 
Other than Sir Alan Sugar, the executive directors' remuneration packages consist of basic salary, benefits, 
performance related bonuses and share options.  Sir Alan Sugar's services are provided to Amstrad plc by 
Amshold Limited, a company owned by Sir Alan Sugar, and Amstrad plc is charged a fee for his services. 
 
The Board believes that a significant proportion of an executive director's remuneration package should be 
linked to performance and this is reflected in the operation of a performance related bonus scheme and a 
performance related share option scheme.  The Company does not currently expect its policy on directors' 
remuneration for subsequent years to change significantly. 
 
Basic salary and benefits 
The executive directors' basic salaries are reviewed by the Committee annually.  In reviewing salaries, 
consideration is given to both individual performance and market conditions. 
 
The benefits provided to the executive directors, other than Sir Alan Sugar, are a car allowance, health and 
long-term disability insurance and life assurance. 
 
Pensions 
The Company does not make any pension contributions to directors or on behalf of directors. 
 
Performance related bonuses 
An executive directors performance related bonus scheme is in place which is based on achievement of 
performance targets which are set by the Remuneration Committee at the start of every financial year.  
Performance is judged against a range of corporate, financial, operational and business development targets. 
 
Share option scheme 
The Company believes that the holding of options by executive directors strengthens the link between their 
personal interests and those of shareholders by giving them an interest in the Company's future.

Report of the Board on Directors' Remuneration (continued) 
 
Share option scheme (continued) 
All employees of the Company, including executive directors other than Sir Alan Sugar, are potential 
beneficiaries of the 1997 Performance Related Share Option Scheme.  The granting of options is generally 
limited to a period of six weeks from the dealing day following the announcement by the Company of its 
annual or half-yearly results.  The options are not transferable and no price is paid for the grant of an option.   
The price on exercise is the closing mid market price on the day preceding the grant of the option.  The options 
are not normally exercisable until the third anniversary of grant and may normally only be exercised if the 
performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee are met.  The performance conditions are that the 
Company's earnings per share have grown by an average of more than 2% per annum over the rate of inflation, 
as measured by the retail prices index, over a three year period.  Earnings per share is considered by the board 
to be an appropriate measure of the economic performance of the Company. 
 
Service agreements 
The Company's policy is for executive directors, other than Sir Alan Sugar, to be employed on a rolling 
contract basis subject to one year's notice on either side.  On termination by the Company, for reasons other 
than a serious breach of their service agreement, the Company will make payment to the executive director not 
exceeding the director's basic salary and benefits for the period of notice.   
 
Each of Messrs M. A. G. Bland, I. P. Saward, S. Sugar and J.S. Beattie have service agreements subject to the 
above terms.  Mr M. A. G. Bland's service agreement commenced on 11 August 1997, Mr I. P. Saward's and 
Mr S. Sugar's on 1 July 1998 and Mr J. S. Beattie's on 1 December 2003. 
 
Sir Alan Sugar's services are provided to Amstrad plc by Amshold Limited, a company owned by Sir Alan 
Sugar, under an agreement dated 3 November 1997 and amended on 1 July 1998.  The agreement is terminable 
on 12 months' notice by either side.  On termination by the Company, by reasons other than a serious breach of 
the agreement, the Company will make payment to Amshold Limited not exceeding the service fee for the 
period of notice. 
 
The non-executive directors are engaged under one year contracts.  Mr J. E. Samson's and Ms M. R. 
Mountford's contracts expire on 25 October 2005.
