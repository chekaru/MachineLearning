 Report of the Board on Directors' Remuneration
This report sets out the policy and disclosures in relation to Directors' Remuneration. At the Annual
General Meeting of the Company to be held on 23 November 2006, this report will be submitted to
shareholders for their approval. This report has been produced in accordance with the requirements
of the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002
and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Composition and terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the Company's remuneration policy and for
determining the terms and conditions of service of the executive directors. The Committee is chaired
by Ms. M. R. Mountford and its other member is Mr. J. E. Samson, both of whom are independent
non-executive directors. The Chairman and Finance Director attend these meetings by invitation.
Non-executive directors
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is reviewed annually and is set by the Board. The
responsibilities of the role and the level of fees paid by similar sized companies are considered in
setting the remuneration policy for non-executive directors.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
In framing its remuneration policy for executive directors, the Committee considers a number of
factors including:-
  the need to attract, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to ensure the
Company is managed successfully for the benefit of shareholders;
  the linking of remuneration to individual and business performance; and
  ensuring that the interests of executive directors are in alignment with those of shareholders.
Other than Sir Alan Sugar, the executive directors' remuneration packages consist of basic salary, benefits,
performance related bonuses and share options. Sir Alan Sugar's services are provided to Amstrad plc by
Amshold Limited, a company owned by Sir Alan Sugar, and Amstrad plc is charged a fee for his services.
The Board believes that a significant proportion of an executive director's remuneration package
should be linked to performance and this is reflected in the operation of a performance related
bonus scheme and a performance related share option scheme. The Company does not currently
expect its policy on directors' remuneration for subsequent years to change significantly.
Basic salary and benefits
The executive directors' basic salaries are reviewed by the Committee annually. In reviewing
salaries, consideration is given to both individual performance and market conditions.
The benefits provided to the executive directors, other than Sir Alan Sugar, are a car allowance,
health and long-term disability insurance and life assurance.
Pensions
The Company does not make any pension contributions to directors or on behalf of directors.
Performance related bonuses
An executive directors' performance related bonus scheme is in place which is based on
achievement of performance targets which are set by the Remuneration Committee at the start of
every financial year. Performance is judged against a range of corporate, financial, operational and
business development targets.
Share option scheme
The Company believes that the holding of options by executive directors strengthens the link between
their personal interests and those of shareholders by giving them an interest in the Company's future.

Share option scheme (continued)
All employees of the Company, including executive directors other than Sir Alan Sugar, are potential
beneficiaries of the 1997 Performance Related Share Option Scheme. The granting of options is
generally limited to a period of six weeks from the dealing day following the announcement by the
Company of its annual or half-yearly results. The options are not transferable and no price is paid for
the grant of an option. The price on exercise is the closing mid market price on the day preceding
the grant of the option. The options are not normally exercisable until the third anniversary of grant
and may normally only be exercised if the performance conditions set by the Remuneration
Committee are met. The performance conditions are that the Company's earnings per share have
grown by an average of more than 2% per annum over the rate of inflation, as measured by the retail
prices index, over a three year period. Earnings per share is considered by the board to be an
appropriate measure of the economic performance of the Company.
Service agreements
The Company's policy is for executive directors, other than Sir Alan Sugar, to be employed on a
rolling contract basis subject to one year's notice on either side. On termination by the Company, for
reasons other than a serious breach of their service agreement, the Company will make a payment to
the executive director not exceeding the director's basic salary and benefits for the period of notice.
Each of Messrs M. A. G. Bland, I. P. Saward, S. Sugar and J.S. Beattie have service agreements
subject to the above terms. Mr M. A. G. Bland's service agreement commenced on 11 August 1997,
Mr I. P. Saward's and Mr S. Sugar's on 1 July 1998 and Mr J. S. Beattie's on 1 December 2003.
Sir Alan Sugar's services are provided to Amstrad plc by Amshold Limited, a company owned by Sir
Alan Sugar, under an agreement dated 3 November 1997 and amended on 1 July 1998. The
agreement is terminable on 12 months' notice by either side. On termination by the Company, by
reasons other than a serious breach of the agreement, the Company will make a payment to
Amshold Limited not exceeding the service fee for the period of notice.
The non-executive directors are engaged under one year contracts. Mr J. E. Samson's and
Ms M. R. Mountford's contracts expire on 25 October 2006.
