On 21 February 2008 the Company exercised the option to acquire the remaining 50% indirect interest in 
Sodem S.A. for a consideration of US$33,637,333 plus costs of US$269,079 at a rate of US$2 to  1. The terms for 
the acquisition of the final 50% indirect interest in Sodem S.A. included the possibility of an earn out payment, 
which may be satisfied in cash and/or through the issue of new Company shares at the Company's option. 
However, under the terms of the stock purchase agreement, certain elements of the earn-out were open to 
interpretation and as the parties failed to reach agreement an arbitrator has now been appointed. The directors 
have submitted to the arbitrator a paper to support their belief that no earn-out is payable and therefore no 
provision has been made for any earn-out as at 31 December 2009.
The Company is deemed to control HASA by virtue of its controlling interest of 80% in Hidroelectrica del Sur 
S.A. (HDS ), which in turn has a controlling interest of 59% in HASA.
