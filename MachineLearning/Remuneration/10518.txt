DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
The purpose of the Remuneration Committee is to fix the remuneration of the executive directors and 
make recommendations to the Board on an overall remuneration policy for executive directors and other 
senior executives in order to retain, attract and motivate high-quality executives capable of achieving 
the Group's objectives.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
All service agreements for directors are terminable on 3 months notice. 
SHARE OPTIONS
The Group believes that share ownership by executive directors and senior executives strengthens the 
links between their personal interest and those of investors and the Board intends to consider the 
adoption of a share option scheme in due course.
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
The directors' remuneration information is set out in note 6 to the financial statements.
