The board recognises that directors' remuneration is of legitimate concern to shareholders and is committed to following current best
practice. The board presents the report of the remuneration committee for shareholder approval.
Remuneration committee
Since August 2001 the remuneration policy for executive directors and the determination of individual directors' remuneration
packages has been delegated to the remuneration committee which consists only of non-executive directors. During the financial
year ended 30 September 2006 the remuneration committee comprised Mr B Keating, Mr John Doherty and Mr Colin J Walsh
(Chairman).
Remuneration policy
Andor's executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the calibre necessary to maintain
the company's position as a growing international business. The performance measurement of the executive directors and the
determination of their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the committee. The four main elements of their remuneration
package are basic annual salary, participation in the company's profit related pay scheme, annual executive bonus payment, and
share option incentives.
The committee reviews each executive director's basic salary annually. In deciding upon appropriate levels of remuneration the
committee has regard to rates of pay for similar jobs in comparable companies as well as internal factors such as the achievement
of strategic objectives, improvement in operating efficiency and overall company performance. Executive directors' basic salaries
were last reviewed on 1 January 2006.
The committee establishes the objectives which must be met before an annual executive bonus may be paid. The committee believes
that the award of any bonus must be tied to the interests of the shareholders and that the principal measure of those interests is
sustainable long term growth in shareholder value. 
The committee considers that share ownership by directors strengthens the link between their personal interests and those of the
other shareholders. This is achieved through the award of options under the share schemes detailed at note 22 to the financial
statements. To date, the exercise of these options has not been subject to the achievement of performance conditions.
Service contracts
Each of the executive directors has service agreements with the company, which are terminable by either party within a defined notice
period as stipulated in their service agreement. The effective dates and notice periods are as follows:
The non-executive directors have letters of appointment. They do not participate in the company's bonus arrangements or pension
scheme.
