The board recognises that directors' remuneration is of legitimate concern to shareholders and is committed to following
current best practice. The board presents the report of the remuneration committee for shareholder approval.
Remuneration committee
Since August 2001, the remuneration policy for executive directors and the determination of individual directors'
remuneration packages has been delegated to the remuneration committee which consists only of non-executive
directors. During the financial year ended 30 September 2007, the remuneration committee comprised Mr B Keating,
Mr J A Doherty and Mr C J Walsh (Chairman).
Remuneration policy
Andor's executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the calibre necessary
to maintain the company's position as a growing international business. The performance measurement of the
executive directors and the determination of their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the committee. The
four main elements of their remuneration package are basic annual salary, participation in the company's profit related
pay scheme, annual executive bonus payment and share option incentives (available to all executive directors).
The committee reviews each executive director's basic salary annually. In deciding upon appropriate levels of
remuneration the committee has regard to rates of pay for similar jobs in comparable companies as well as internal
factors such as the achievement of strategic objectives, improvement in operating efficiency and overall company
performance. Executive directors' basic salaries were last reviewed on 1 January 2007 with the exception of Mr C Walsh
whose salary was reviewed on 29 May 2007.
The committee establishes the objectives which must be met before an annual executive bonus may be paid. The
committee believes that the award of any bonus must be tied to the interests of the shareholders and that the principal
measure of those interests is sustainable long term growth in shareholder value. 
The committee considers that share ownership by directors strengthens the link between their personal interests and
those of the other shareholders. This is achieved through the award of options under the share schemes detailed at
note 21 to the financial statements. To date, the exercise of these options has not been subject to the achievement of
performance conditions.
Service contracts
Each of the executive directors have service agreements with the company, which are terminable by either party within
a defined notice period as stipulated in their service agreement. The effective dates and notice periods are as follows:
The non-executive directors have letters of appointment. They do not participate in the company's bonus arrangements
or pension scheme.
