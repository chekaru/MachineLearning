The Board recognises that directors' remuneration is of legitimate concern to shareholders and is committed to following current 
best practice. 
Remuneration committee
Since August 2001, the remuneration policy for executive directors and the determination of individual directors' remuneration 
packages has been delegated to the remuneration committee which consists only of non-executive directors. During the financial 
year ended 30 September 2009, the remuneration committee comprised Dr B Keating, and Mr C J Walsh (Chairman).
Remuneration policy
Andor's executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the calibre necessary to maintain 
the company's position as a growing international business. The performance measurement of the executive directors and the 
determination of their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the remuneration committee. The four main elements of 
their remuneration package are basic annual salary, participation in the company's profit related pay scheme, annual executive 
bonus payment and share option incentives (available to all executive directors).
The committee reviews each executive director's basic salary annually. In deciding upon appropriate levels of remuneration the 
committee has regard to rates of pay for similar jobs in comparable companies as well as internal factors such as the achievement 
of strategic objectives, improvement in operating efficiency and overall company performance. Executive directors' basic salaries 
were last reviewed on 1 January 2009.
The committee establishes the objectives which must be met before an annual executive bonus may be paid. The committee 
believes that the award of any bonus must be tied to the interests of the shareholders and that the principal measure of those 
interests is sustainable long term growth in shareholder value. 
The committee considers that share ownership by directors strengthens the link between their personal interests and those of the 
other shareholders. This is achieved through the award of options under the share schemes detailed at note 20 to the financial 
statements. Options granted in the year are subject to the achievement of performance conditions.
Service contracts
Each of the executive directors have service agreements with the company, which are terminable by either party within a defined 
notice period as stipulated in their service agreement. The effective dates and notice periods are as follows:
The non-executive directors have letters of appointment. They do not participate in the company's bonus arrangements or
pension scheme.
