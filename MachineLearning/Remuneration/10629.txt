5. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations 
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The group makes estimates and assumptions 
concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.  The estimates 
and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are discussed below:
(a) Assessment of the fair value of acquired intangibles 
The fair value of the acquired intangibles is based on a number of assumptions, including a discount rate and growth rates in 
revenue. If the discount rate and growth rates were to have changed by 1% the effect on the fair value of the acquired intangibles 
as of the date of acquisition would have been:
 '000
Increase in discount rate by 1% (455)
Decrease in discount rate by 1% 488
Increase in revenue growth rates by 1% 360
Decrease in revenue growth rates by 1% (356)
The effect of a change in the fair value of the acquired intangibles of  100,000 on the consolidated comprehensive income statement 
for the year ended 30 September 2010 would be  6,998.
(b) Estimate of useful economic life of intangible assets 
The group assesses the useful economic life of intangible assets on an annual basis. The useful economic life of the intangible 
assets ranges from four years to ten years.  If the remaining useful economic lives had been shortened by 1 year, amortisation 
charged to the income statement during the year would have increased by  71,000 and if the remaining useful economic lives had 
been extended by 1year, amortisation charged to the income statement during the year would have decreased by  63,000.
(c) Accounting treatment of contingent consideration payable for acquisitions.
As part of the acquisition of Bitplane AG and Photonics Inc certain shareholders of those entities were employed by the group 
post acquisition. In accordance with IFRS 3 (Revised) management have determined that the contingent consideration payable is 
consideration rather than remuneration. Had management determined that the contingent consideration was remuneration the 
group's operating profit would have decreased by  1m.

the year ended 30 September 2010 (continued)
6. Segment information
Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the management board for strategic 
decision-making purposes. The management board has considered the business from both a geographic and market sector 
perspective. 
From a geographic perspective, the management board considers that the group has four operating segments: i) Rest of World; ii) 
United States of America; iii) Japan, and; iv) Bitplane, all of which are separate reportable segments.  The Rest of World, United States 
of America and Japan segments derive their revenues from the sale of high performance digital cameras and microscopy systems. 
Bitplane derives its revenues from the sale of microscopy image analysis software.
The segment information provided to the management board for the reportable segments for the years ended 30 September 2010 
and 30 September 2009 is as follows:
2010 2009
Segment revenues  '000  '000

* The results of the company's subsidiary undertaking, which was acquired during the year, are separately reported to the 
management board and are therefore disclosed as a separate reportable segment. Andor Technology PLC   Annual Report 2010

Sales between segments are carried out at arm's length. Revenue from external customers reported to the management board is 
measured in a manner consistent with that in the income statement. There are no significant seasonal fluctuations. The management 
board assesses the performance of each operating segment based on its material margin.  Material margin is measured in a manner 
consistent with that in the income statement.
The amounts provided to the management board with respect to total assets and liabilities are measured in a manner consistent 
with that of the financial statements. The assets are allocated based on the operations of the segment and their physical location. 
The liabilities are allocated based on the operations of the segment. The group interest bearing loan is not considered to be a 
segment liability.

A number of changes to the UK Corporation tax system were announced in the June 2010 Budget Statement. The Finance (No 2) 
Act 2010 is expected to include legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011. Further 
reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 24% by 1 April 2014. The changes had not been 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not included in these financial statements. 
The effect of the changes to be enacted in the Finance (No 2) Act 2010 would be to reduce the deferred tax asset provided at 30 
September 2010 by  56,000. This  56,000 decrease in the deferred tax asset would increase profit for the year by  21,000, with 
a reduction in deferred tax credit recognised in equity of  77,000. This decrease in the deferred tax asset is due to the reduction in 
the corporation tax rate from 28% to 27% with effect from 1 April 2011. 
The proposed reductions of the main rate of corporation tax by 1% per year to 24% by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted 
separately each year. The overall effect of the further changes from 27% to 24%, if these applied to the deferred tax balance at 30 
September 2010, would be to reduce the deferred tax asset by  168,000 (being  56,000 recognised each year until 2014).

11. Income tax expense (continued) 12. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per ordinary share is based on retained profit for the financial period and on the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue during the period. Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated using an adjusted number of shares 
reflecting the number of dilutive shares under option and the number of dilutive shares forming part of contingent consideration 
payable on acquisitions.
