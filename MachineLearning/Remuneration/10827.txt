 Pension Costs 
The contributions payable to the scheme in respect of employee
service rendered during each year is recognised as an expense
in that year. Contributions not paid at balance sheet date are
included within accruals.
Foreign Currency
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign
currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange
ruling at the date of the transaction. Exchange differences are
taken into account in arriving at the operating result. 
Leased Assets and Obligations
Where assets are financed by leasing agreements that give
rights approximating to ownership (finance leases ), the
assets are treated as if they had been purchased outright. The
amount capitalised is the present value of the minimum lease
payments payable during the lease terms. The corresponding
leasing commitments are shown as obligations to the lessor.
Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and
interest elements, and the interest is charged to the profit and
loss in proportion to the remaining balance outstanding. 
All other leases are  operating leases' and the annual rentals
are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis
over the lease term. 
Government Grants
Government grants of a revenue nature are credited to the
profit and loss account in the same period as the related
expenditure.
Share Based Payments
The Company issues equity settled share based payments to
certain employees. Equity settled share based payments are
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value
determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line
basis over an estimated vesting period. Fair value is measured
by use of a binomial model.   
Taxation
Tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the
period which may differ from net profit reported in the income
statement. 
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing
differences that have originated but not reversed at the
balance sheet date where transactions or events have
occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay
further tax, or a right to pay less tax in future. Timing
differences are differences between the Company's taxable
profits and its results as stated in the financial statements
that arise from the gains or losses in tax assessments in
period different from those in which they are recognised in the
financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised only
to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely
than not that there will be sufficient taxable profits from
which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences
can be deducted. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax
rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the
timing differences are expected to reverse.
