Remuneration report 
The Company is not required by either the Listing Rules or  
the Companies Act to produce a remuneration report, but  
has done so because of its commitment to maintaining  
the highest standards of Corporate Governance. The 
Company's remuneration policy is the responsibility of  
the Remuneration Committee.
r emuneration Policy
The Company's policy on remuneration is to attract, retain and 
incentivise the Directors and staff in a manner consistent with  
the goals of good corporate governance. In setting the Company's 
remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee considers  
a number of factors including the basic salary, incentives and 
benefits available to executive Directors, senior managers  
and staff of comparable companies. Consistent with this policy 
the Company's remuneration packages awarded to executive 
Directors and senior management are intended to be competitive, 
comprise a significant proportion of performance related 
remuneration and align employees with shareholders' interests. 
In 2005, the Remuneration Committee commissioned KPMG 
(UK) LLP to conduct an independent review of executive 
remuneration arrangements and make recommendations 
for improvement. Following the review the Company is 
introducing a Deferred Annual Bonus Plan and a Venture 
Investment Plan.
basic salary and benefits
Salary levels are reviewed annually. The Committee believes 
that basic pay should be competitive in the relevant 
employment market and reflect individual responsibilities  
and performance. Medical health insurance and life cover 
benefits are also provided to employees and in addition US 
employees have dental insurance and a defined contribution 
pension scheme. 
d eferred a nnual bonus Plan
The aim of the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan is to incentivise 
employees to achieve stretching annual performance  
targets and to align short term performance with long term 
shareholder interests by encouraging employees to defer 
bonuses into ANGLE plc shares.
Bonus targets under the plan are linked to Group and/or 
Business Unit profitability, operational performance and 
individual performance. The Remuneration Committee 
establishes the targets which must be achieved by Directors  
in order to receive a payment and these are reviewed annually. 
Directors and other senior management are required  
to compulsorily defer 50% of any earned bonus into  
ANGLE plc shares for a further three years subject to 
continued employment over the period. Additionally 
individuals have the opportunity to voluntarily defer any of 
their remaining bonus into shares, and receive one free 
matching share for each voluntarily deferred share at the end 
of the three year period. 
All employees in the company are eligible to participate to 
some extent in the plan though the bonus potential and 
performance targets reflect the seniority and responsibility  
of the individual. 
v enture investment Plan 
Executive Directors, regional chief executives and venture 
team staff are eligible to participate in the Venture Investment 
Plan. The aim of the plan is to provide a long term incentive 
linked to the realised cash gains from the Ventures business.
The level of bonus received by participants is a function of  
the cash profits realised from the Ventures business and the 
number of participation points an individual has earned. The 
cash profits are determined after recovering all ventures costs 
and achieving a hurdle rate.
share o Ptions
In future years, the company does not normally intend to grant 
share options to employees participating in the Deferred 
Annual Bonus and Venture Investment Plan. However, the 
Remuneration Committee has discretion to grant share 
options in special circumstances. 
None of the awards under the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan, 
Venture Investment Plan or Share Option arrangements  
are pensionable.
Non-executive Directors receive a fixed fee for their services 
and the reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in 
attending meetings. The remuneration of the Non-executive 
Directors is determined by the Board as a whole within the 
overall limits stipulated in the Articles of Association. Non-
executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the 
Company's incentive schemes. ANGLE plc  Annu Al Repo Rt And Accounts 2006
