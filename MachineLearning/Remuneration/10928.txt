 The Company is not required by either the Listing Rules or the 
Companies Act to produce a remuneration report, but has done 
so because of its commitment to maintaining high standards of 
Corporate Governance. The Company's remuneration policy is 
the responsibility of the Remuneration Committee.
r emuneration policy
The Company's policy on remuneration is to attract, retain and 
incentivise the Directors and staff in a manner consistent with the 
goals of good corporate governance. In setting the Company's 
remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee considers 
a number of factors including the basic salary, incentives and 
benefits available to Executive Directors, senior managers and 
staff of comparable companies. Consistent with this policy the 
Company's remuneration packages awarded to Executive 
Directors and senior management are intended to be competitive, 
comprise a significant proportion of performance related 
remuneration and align employees with shareholders' interests. 
Basic salary and benefits
Salary levels are reviewed annually. The Committee believes that 
basic pay should be competitive in the relevant employment 
market and reflect individual responsibilities and performance. 
Medical health insurance and life cover benefits are also 
provided to employees and in addition US employees have 
dental insurance and a defined contribution pension scheme. 
d eferred a nnual Bonus plan
The aim of the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan is to incentivise 
employees to achieve stretching annual performance targets 
and to align short term performance with long term shareholder 
interests by encouraging employees to defer bonuses into 
ANGLE plc shares.
Bonus targets under the plan are linked to Group and/or 
Business Unit profitability, operational performance and 
individual performance. The Remuneration Committee 
establishes the targets which must be achieved by Directors in 
order to receive a payment and these are reviewed annually. 
Directors and other senior management are required to defer 
50% of any earned bonus into ANGLE plc shares for a further 
three years subject to continued employment over the period. 
Additionally individuals have the opportunity to voluntarily defer 
any of their remaining bonus into shares, and receive one free 
matching share for each voluntarily deferred share at the end of 
the three year period. 
All employees in the Company are eligible to participate to 
some extent in the plan though the bonus potential and 
performance targets reflect the seniority and responsibility 
of the individual. 
Venture incentive plan 
Executive Directors, regional chief executives and venture team 
staff are eligible to participate in the Venture Incentive Plan. The 
aim of the plan is to provide a long term incentive linked to the 
realised cash gains from the Ventures business and is therefore 
closely aligned with the interests of shareholders.
The level of cash bonus received by participants is a function 
of the cash profits realised from the Ventures business and the 
number of participation points an individual has earned. The 
cash profits are determined after recovering all ventures costs 
and achieving a hurdle rate.
Share options
In future years, the Company does not normally intend to grant 
share options to employees participating in the Deferred Annual 
Bonus and Venture Incentive Plan. However, the Remuneration 
Committee has discretion to grant share options in special 
circumstances. 
None of the awards under the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan, 
Venture Incentive Plan or Share Option arrangements are 
pensionable.
Non-executive Directors receive a fixed fee for their services 
and the reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in 
attending meetings. The remuneration of the Non-executive 
Directors is determined by the Board as a whole within the 
overall limits stipulated in the Articles of Association. Non-
executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of 
the Company's incentive schemes.
