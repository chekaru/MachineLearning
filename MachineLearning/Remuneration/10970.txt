 Remuneration Report
ANGLE plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Page 23
The Company is not required by either the AIM Listing Rules or the Companies Act to produce a remuneration report, but has done so because of its
commitment to maintaining high standards of Corporate Governance. The Company's remuneration policy is the responsibility of the Remuneration
Committee.
Remuneration policy
The Company's policy on remuneration is to attract, retain and incentivise the Directors and staff in a manner consistent with the goals of good
corporate governance. In setting the Company's remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee considers a number of factors including the
basic salary, incentives and benefits available to Executive Directors, senior managers and staff of comparable companies. Consistent with this policy
the Company's remuneration packages awarded to Executive Directors and senior management are intended to be competitive, comprise a
significant proportion of performance related remuneration and align employees with shareholders' interests.
Basic salary and benefits
Salary levels are reviewed annually. The Committee believes that basic pay should be competitive in the relevant employment market and reflect
individual responsibilities and performance. Medical health insurance and life cover benefits are also provided to employees and in addition US
employees have dental insurance and a defined contribution pension scheme.
Deferred Annual Bonus Plan
The aim of the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan is to incentivise employees to achieve stretching annual performance targets and to align short term
performance with long term shareholder interests by encouraging employees to defer bonuses into ANGLE plc shares.
Bonus targets under the plan are linked to Group and/or Business Unit profitability, operational performance and individual performance.
The Remuneration Committee establishes the targets which must be achieved by Directors in order to receive a payment and these are reviewed
as required.
Directors and other senior management are required to compulsorily defer 50% of any earned bonus into ANGLE plc shares for a further three years
subject to continued employment over the period. Additionally individuals have the opportunity to voluntarily defer any of their remaining bonuses
into shares, and receive one free matching share for each voluntarily deferred share at the end of the three year period.
When in operation, all employees in the Group (excluding controlled investments) are eligible to participate to some extent in the plan though the
bonus potential and performance targets reflect the seniority and responsibility of the individual.
Venture Incentive Plan
Executive Directors, regional chief executives and venture team staff are eligible to participate in the Venture Incentive Plan. The aim of the plan is to
provide a long term incentive linked to the realised cash gains from the Ventures business and is therefore closely aligned with the interests of
shareholders.
The level of cash bonus received by participants is a function of the cash profits realised from the Ventures business and the number of participation
points earned. The cash profits are determined after recovering all ventures costs and achieving a hurdle rate.
Share options
The Company does not normally intend to grant share options to employees participating in the Deferred Annual Bonus and Venture Incentive Plan.
However, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to grant share options in special circumstances.
Discretionary incentives
The Group may operate with discretionary incentives either in addition to or instead of the incentives described above in any particular year,
dependent on the needs of the business.
None of the awards under the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan,Venture Incentive Plan, Share Option arrangements or discretionary incentives are
pensionable.
Non-executive Directors receive a fixed fee for their services and the reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in attending meetings.
The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is determined by the Board as a whole within the overall limits stipulated in the Articles of
Association. Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Company's incentive schemes.
