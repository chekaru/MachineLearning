 Remuneration Report
The Company is not required by either the AIM Listing Rules or the Companies Act to produce a remuneration report, but has provided the
information below because of its commitment to maintaining high standards of corporate governance. The Company's remuneration policy
is the responsibility of the Remuneration Committee.
Remuneration policy
The Company's policy on remuneration is to attract, retain and incentivise the Directors and staff in a manner consistent with the goals of good
corporate governance. In setting the Company's remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee considers a number of factors including the
basic salary, incentives and benefits available to Executive Directors, senior managers and staff of comparable companies. Consistent with this
policy the Company's remuneration packages awarded to Executive Directors and senior management are intended to be competitive, comprise
a significant proportion of performance related remuneration and align employees with shareholders' interests.
Basic salary and benefits
Salary levels are reviewed annually. The Committee believes that basic pay should be competitive in the relevant employment market and reflect
individual responsibilities and performance. Medical health insurance and life cover benefits are also provided to employees.
Trading Performance Annual Bonus Plan
The Company has a Trading Performance Annual Bonus Plan. This Plan seeks to focus efforts on increasing profitability by allocating a proportion of
the increase in Profits After Tax from Trading Performance compared to the prior year to a bonus pool for the Executive Directors and staff.
The former Deferred Annual Bonus Plan is being wound down and now refers only to the residual rights of a small number of employees and former
employees.
Proceeds of Realised Investments Bonus Plan
The Company has a Proceeds of Realised Investments Bonus Plan. This plan seeks to focus efforts on the achievement of investment realisations by
allocating 10% of all cash realisations to a bonus pool for the Executive Directors and staff.
It is the intention that for each  1 paid out as a bonus under this plan (payment of which will be subject to the cash needs of the business at that
time), an amount of  5 will be paid to shareholders as a distribution. Distributions will be subject to the availability of distributable reserves and when
appropriate the Company will seek the necessary approvals to allow this.
The former Venture Incentive Plan is being wound down and now refers only to the residual rights of a small number of employees and former
employees and specifically excludes the Executive Directors.
Share options
The Company has established an Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) Share Option Scheme and will operate this in conjunction with the existing
Approved and Unapproved share option schemes.
Discretionary incentives
The Group may operate with discretionary incentives either in addition to or instead of the incentives described above in any particular year,
dependent on the needs of the business.
Non-pensionable
None of the awards under the Trading Performance Annual Bonus Plan, Proceeds of Realised Investments Bonus plan, Share Option arrangements
or discretionary incentives are pensionable.
Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors receive a fixed fee for their services and the reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in attending meetings. The
remuneration of the Non-executive Directors, which is determined by the Board as a whole within the overall limits stipulated in the Articles of
Association, was unchanged during the year. Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Company's incentive schemes.
