ANGLE plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Remuneration Report
The Company is not required by either the AIM Listing Rules or the Companies Act to produce a remuneration report, but has provided the information below because 
of its commitment to maintaining high standards of corporate governance. The Company's remuneration policy is the responsibility of the Remuneration Committee.
Remuneration policy
The Company's policy on remuneration is to attract, retain and incentivise the Directors and staff in a manner consistent with the goals of good corporate governance.  
In setting the Company's remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee considers a number of factors including the basic salary, incentives and benefits available 
to Executive Directors, senior managers and staff of comparable companies. Consistent with this policy the Company's remuneration packages awarded to Executive 
Directors and senior management are intended to be competitive, comprise a significant proportion of performance related remuneration and align employees with 
shareholders' interests. 
Basic salary and benefits
Salary levels are reviewed annually. The Committee believes that basic pay should be competitive in the relevant employment market and reflect individual 
responsibilities and performance. Medical health insurance and life cover benefits are also provided to employees. 
Trading Performance Annual Bonus Plan
The Company has a Trading Performance Annual Bonus Plan. This Plan seeks to focus efforts on increasing profitability by allocating a proportion of the increase in 
Profits after tax from Trading Performance compared to the prior year to a bonus pool for the Executive Directors and staff. 
Proceeds of Realised Investments Bonus Plan 
The Company has a Proceeds of Realised Investments Bonus Plan. This Plan seeks to focus efforts on the achievement of investment realisations by allocating 10%  
of all cash realisations to a bonus pool for the Executive Directors and staff. It is the intention that for each  1 paid out as a bonus under this Plan (payment of which 
will be subject to the cash needs of the business at that time), an amount of  5 will be paid to shareholders as a distribution. Distributions will be subject to the 
availability of distributable reserves and when appropriate the Company will seek the necessary approvals to allow this. 
Share options
The Company has Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) and Unapproved share option schemes as a means of encouraging ownership and aligning interests of staff 
and external shareholders. 
Discretionary incentives
The Group may operate with discretionary incentives either in addition to or instead of the incentives described above in any particular year, dependent on the needs 
of the business.
Non-pensionable
None of the awards under the Trading Performance Annual Bonus Plan, Proceeds of Realised Investments Bonus Plan, share option schemes or discretionary incentives 
are pensionable.
Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors receive a fixed fee for their services and the reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in attending meetings. The remuneration of  
the Non-executive Directors, which is determined by the Board as a whole within the overall limits stipulated in the Articles of Association, was unchanged during  
the year. Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Company's incentive schemes.

Directors' interests - share options continued
Directors' options issued on the 29 July 2005, 30 March 2006, 27 April 2006 and 21 March 2007 were cancelled. As part of a revitalised remuneration scheme, new 
EMI (Enterprise Management Incentive) and Unapproved options were issued to Directors on 30 August 2011. No Directors' options were exercised during the year. 
Following the success in validating the Parsortix separation device for the capture of both breast cancer and prostate cancer cells added to healthy blood, the Board 
believe there is a major opportunity in cancer diagnostics.  To drive the future growth in the business, additional share options were issued to Directors and staff 
involved in Parsortix on 18 November 2011.
The share options issued during the year were subject to both performance and service (employment) conditions, and the earliest exercise date is determined 
according to these vesting conditions which are described in Notes (1) and (2) above for the respective awards. 
Note 20 provides additional information on share options.
