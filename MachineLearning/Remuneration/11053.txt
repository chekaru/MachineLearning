Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Remuneration Report
The Company is not required by either the AIM Listing Rules or the Companies Act to produce a remuneration report, but has provided the information below because 
of its commitment to maintaining high standards of corporate governance. The Company's remuneration policy is the responsibility of the Remuneration Committee.
Remuneration policy
The Company's policy on remuneration is to attract, retain and incentivise the Directors and staff in a manner consistent with the goals of good corporate  
governance. In setting the Company's remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee considers a number of factors including the basic salary, incentives and 
benefits available to Executive Directors, senior managers and staff of comparable companies. Consistent with this policy the Company's remuneration packages 
awarded to Executive Directors and senior management are intended to be competitive, comprise a significant proportion of performance related remuneration  
and align employees with shareholders' interests.
Basic salary and benefits
Salary levels are reviewed annually. The Committee believes that basic pay should be competitive in the relevant employment market and reflect individual 
responsibilities and performance. Medical health insurance and life cover benefits are also provided to employees. 
Trading Performance Annual Bonus Plan
The Company has a Trading Performance Annual Bonus Plan. This Plan seeks to focus efforts on increasing profitability by allocating a proportion of the increase  
in Profits after tax from Trading Performance compared to the prior year to a bonus pool for the Executive Directors and staff.
Proceeds of Realised Investments Bonus Plan 
The Company has a Proceeds of Realised Investments Bonus Plan. This Plan seeks to focus efforts on the achievement of investment realisations by allocating  
10% of all cash realisations to a bonus pool for the Executive Directors and staff. Funds raised from investment realisations will be allocated to the development  
of the Group's specialist medtech business. Surplus funds, if any, will be returned to shareholders as a distribution. Distributions will be subject to the availability  
of distributable reserves and when appropriate the Company will seek the necessary approvals to allow this.
Share options
The Company has Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) and Unapproved Share Option Schemes as a means of encouraging ownership and aligning interests  
of staff and external shareholders.
Discretionary incentives 
The Group may operate with discretionary incentives either in addition to or instead of the incentives described above in any particular year, dependent on the needs 
of the business.
Non-pensionable
None of the awards under the Trading Performance Annual Bonus Plan, Proceeds of Realised Investments Bonus Plan, Share Option Schemes or discretionary 
incentives are pensionable.
 
Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors receive a fixed fee for their services and the reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in attending meetings. The remuneration of the 
Non-executive Directors, which is determined by the Board as a whole within the overall limits stipulated in the Articles of Association, was unchanged during the 
year. Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Company's incentive schemes.
