Unaudited information: 
Remuneration Committee and Policy 
The remuneration committee is comprised of Howard Miller (chairman) and Danesh V arma. No remuneration 
consultants were employed during the year.  
The board s aim, implemented by the committee, with regard to executive and non-executive directors 
remuneration is to provide a package which will attract, retain and motivate directors of the calibre required and 
be consistent with the group s limited ability to pay directors in cash. Consequently share options form a maj or 
part of the executive directors remuneration and all of the non-executive directors remuneration.  
Terms and conditions of service 
There are no directors service contracts and, except in the case of Ian Cuthbertson, no arrangements in force 
whereby the group is under an obligation to pay fees, salaries, pensions or any other remuneration to any of the 
directors.  
All directors and employees are eligible to receive options. In determining the amount of options to be granted to 
each individual, the directors take into account the need for and value of his services, the amount of time he 
spends on the business of the group and any other remuneration receivable by him from the group.  
In respect of those share options marked with an asterisk in the table overleaf, there are performance criteria to 
be met, namely that the company s share price performance over the period from grant to exercise must exceed 
that of the companies in the top quartile of the FTS E 100 index. This index was selected as being an easily 
available benchmark of general corporate performance. There are no performance criteria to be met in respect of 
other share options, since these were awarded at a time when performance conditions were not generally applied 
to share options. Each grant of an option was made at a cost to the participant of  1.  
Total shareholder return graph 
This graph shows the total shareholder return over a five year period for the company and for the FTS E Allshare 
Mining index, being the most appropriate comparative available for the company covering the past five years.
