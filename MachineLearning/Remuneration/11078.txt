Remuneration Committee Policy and Share Option Scheme 
The remuneration committee is comprised of Howard Miller (chairman) and Danesh V arma. No remuneration 
consultants were employed during the year.  
The board s aim, implemented by the committee, with regard to executive and non-executive directors 
remuneration, is to provide a package which will attract, retain and motivate directors of the calibre required and 
be consistent with the group s limited ability to pay directors in cash. Consequently share options form a maj or 
part of the executive directors remuneration and all of the non-executive directors remuneration.  
The time period for issuing options under company s existing share option schemes having expired, the directors 
consider it to be desirable and in the best interests of the company that a new scheme be adopted by the 
company at the forthcoming AGM and that new and replacement share options be granted by the directors under 
that scheme. A copy of the rules of the proposed scheme is provided with this annual report. The scheme is open 
to all the directors, employees and consultants working for the company and has no limits on individual option 
grants but includes an overall limit on the number of options which may be issued under this or any other scheme 
of the company of 10% of the issued ordinary shares. The grant of share options is at the discretion of the 
R emuneration Committee and none of the benefits of the scheme are pensionable.  The Committee may alter the 
S cheme at any time provided that no alteration or addition to the advantage of any existing participant or person 
eligible to participate may be made without prior approval of the shareholders of the company unless such 
alteration is a minor amendment to benefit the administration of the Scheme. 
The directors believe the adoption of this scheme will provide the company with a valuable means of retaining 
and motivating those contributing to the success of the company. 
Terms and conditions of service 
There are no directors service contracts and, except in the case of Ian Cuthbertson, no arrangements in force 
whereby the group is under an obligation to pay fees, salaries, pensions or any other remuneration to any of the 
directors.  
All directors and employees are eligible to receive options. In determining the amount of options to be granted to 
each individual, the directors take into account the need for and value of his services, the amount of time he 
spends on the business of the group and any other remuneration receivable by him from the group.  
In respect of those share options marked with an asterisk in the table overleaf, there are performance criteria to 
be met, namely that the company s share price performance over the period from grant to exercise must exceed 
that of the companies in the top quartile of the FTS E 100 index. This index was selected as being an easily 
available benchmark of general corporate performance. There are no performance criteria to be met in respect of 
other share options. Each grant of an option was made at a cost to the participant of  1.
