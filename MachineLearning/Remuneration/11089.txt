  
Directors' Remuneration Report 2006 
 
Anglesey Mining plc 14 
Unaudited information: 
The Directors' Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with schedule 7A of the Companies Act 
1985. 
Remuneration Committee Policy and Share Options 
During the year the remuneration committee comprised Howard Miller (chairman) and Danesh Varma; no 
remuneration consultants were employed.  
The board's aim, implemented by the committee, with regard to executive and non-executive directors' 
remuneration, is to provide a package which will attract, retain and motivate directors of the calibre required 
and be consistent with the group's ability to pay. So far as is possible, it is the group's policy to keep contract 
durations, notice periods and termination payments to a minimum. A bonus for attainment of key corporate 
targets forms part of overall executive director remuneration. Share options continue to form a major part of 
the executive directors' remuneration and all of the non-executive directors' remuneration, however in the 
light of the recommendations of the Combined Code, the committee continues to review means by which non-
executive directors may be remunerated, other than the use of share options. 
The company has one share scheme, the 2004 Unapproved Share Option Scheme, and share options were issued 
during the year under the terms of that scheme. All directors and employees are eligible to receive options. In 
determining the amount of options to be granted to each individual, the directors take into account the need 
for and value of the services provided, the amount of time spent on the business of the group and any other 
remuneration receivable from the group.  
In respect of those share options marked with an asterisk in the table overleaf, there are performance criteria 
to be met, namely that the company's share price performance over the period from grant to exercise must 
exceed that of the companies in the top quartile of the FTSE 100 index. This index was selected as being an 
easily available benchmark of general corporate performance. There are no performance criteria to be met in 
respect of the other share option. 
Terms and conditions of service 
Bill Hooley (who joined the board during the year) and Ian Cuthbertson receive fees and a salary respectively, 
have notice periods not exceeding 6 months and no other entitlement to termination payments. They are 
eligible to receive performance bonuses when key corporate targets are attained. Other than these, there are 
no directors' service contracts, nor any arrangements in force whereby the group is under an obligation to pay 
fees, salaries, bonuses, pensions or any remuneration to any of the directors.  
Total shareholder return graph  
This graph shows the total shareholder return over a five year period for the company and for the FTSE Mining 
index, being the most appropriate comparative available for the company covering the past five years:
