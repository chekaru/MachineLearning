  
Directors' Remuneration Report 2007 
 
Unaudited information: 
The Directors' Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985. 
Remuneration Committee Policy and Share Options 
During the year the remuneration committee comprised Howard Miller (chairman) and Danesh Varma; no 
remuneration consultants were employed.  
The board's aim, implemented by the committee, with regard to executive and non-executive directors' 
remuneration, is to provide a package which will attract, retain and motivate directors of the calibre required and be 
consistent with the group's ability to pay. So far as is possible, it is the group's policy to keep contract durations, 
notice periods and termination payments to a minimum. A bonus for attainment of key corporate targets forms part of 
overall executive director remuneration. Share options continue to form a major part of the executive directors' 
remuneration and all of the non-executive directors' remuneration, however in the light of the recommendations of 
the Combined Code, the committee continues to review means by which non-executive directors may be 
remunerated, other than the use of share options. 
The company has one share scheme, the 2004 Unapproved Share Option Scheme; no share options were issued during 
the year under the terms of that scheme. All directors and employees are eligible to receive options. In determining 
the amount of options to be granted to each individual, the directors take into account the need for and value of the 
services provided, the amount of time spent on the business of the group and any other remuneration receivable from 
the group.  
In respect of those share options marked with an asterisk in the table overleaf, there are performance criteria to be 
met, namely that the company's share price performance over the period from grant to exercise must exceed that of 
the companies in the top quartile of the FTSE 100 index. This index was selected as being an easily available 
benchmark of general corporate performance. There are no performance criteria to be met in respect of the other 
share options, which were exercised during the year. 
Terms and conditions of service 
Bill Hooley and Ian Cuthbertson receive fees and a salary respectively, have notice periods not exceeding 6 months 
and no other entitlement to termination payments. They are eligible to receive performance bonuses when key 
corporate targets are attained. Other than these, there are no directors' service contracts, nor any arrangements in 
force whereby the group is under an obligation to pay fees, salaries, bonuses, pensions or any remuneration to any of 
the directors.
