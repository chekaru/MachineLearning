  
Directors' Remuneration Report 2008 
 
Anglesey Mining plc 12 
Unaudited information: 
The Directors' Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985. 
Remuneration Committee Policy and Share Options 
During the year the remuneration committee comprised Howard Miller (chairman) and Danesh Varma; no 
remuneration consultants were employed.  
The board's aim, implemented by the committee, with regard to executive and non-executive directors' 
remuneration, is to provide a package which will attract, retain and motivate directors of the calibre required and be 
consistent with the group's ability to pay. So far as is possible, it is the group's policy to keep contract durations, 
notice periods and termination payments to a minimum. In practice this results in rolling 12 month contracts. A bonus 
for attainment of key corporate targets forms part of overall executive director remuneration. Share options continue 
to form a major part of the directors' remuneration however with effect from 1 April 2007 a fee payment has been 
introduced for non-executive directors and the use of share options in future will be reduced accordingly. Any 
pensions contributions are to money purchase schemes and are regarded as a component of total remuneration.  
The company has one share scheme, the 2004 Unapproved Share Option Scheme. All directors and employees are 
eligible to receive options. In determining the amount of options to be granted to each individual, the directors take 
into account the need for and value of the services provided, the amount of time spent on the business of the group 
and any other remuneration receivable from the group. All share options are subject to a performance criterion, 
namely that the company's share price performance over the period from grant to exercise must exceed that of the 
companies in the top quartile of the FTSE 100 index. This index was selected as being an easily available benchmark 
of general corporate performance.  
Terms and conditions of service 
Bill Hooley and Ian Cuthbertson receive fees and a salary respectively, have written terms of employment with rolling 
notice periods of 12 months and no other entitlement to termination payments. They are eligible to receive 
performance bonuses when key corporate targets are attained.  
Each of the non-executive directors has a written contract for services, terminable at one month's notice.  
Other than these, there are no arrangements in force whereby the group is under an obligation to pay fees, salaries, 
bonuses, pensions or any remuneration to any director.
