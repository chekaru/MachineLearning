  
Directors' Remuneration Report 2010 
 
Anglesey Mining plc 13 
Unaudited information: 
 
The Directors' Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with schedule 8 part 3 of the Companies Act 
2006. 
Remuneration Committee policy and share options 
During the year the remuneration committee comprised Howard Miller (chairman) and Danesh Varma; no 
remuneration consultants were employed.  
The board's aim, implemented by the committee, with regard to executive and non-executive directors' 
remuneration, is to provide a package which will attract, retain and motivate directors of the calibre required and be 
consistent with the group's ability to pay. So far as is possible, it is the group's policy to keep contract durations, 
notice periods and termination payments to a minimum. In practice this results in rolling 12 month contracts.  
A bonus for attainment of key corporate targets forms part of overall executive director remuneration. Share options 
continue to form a major part of executive and non-executive directors' remuneration however a fee payment has 
been made to non-executive directors since April 2007 and future share option grants will be reduced or eliminated 
accordingly. Any pension contributions are to money purchase schemes and regarded as a component of total 
remuneration. There have been no new appointments during the year and the committee has not recommended any 
changes to existing remuneration packages.  
The company has one active share scheme, the 2004 Unapproved Share Option Scheme. All directors and employees 
are eligible to receive options. In determining the amount of options to be granted to each individual, the directors 
take into account the need for and value of the services provided, the amount of time spent on the business of the 
group and any other remuneration receivable from the group. All share options are subject to a performance 
criterion, namely that the company's share price performance over the period from grant to exercise must exceed 
that of the companies in the top quartile of the FTSE 100 index. This index was selected as being an easily available 
benchmark of general corporate performance.  
Terms and conditions of service 
Bill Hooley and Ian Cuthbertson have written terms of employment with rolling notice periods of 12 months and no 
other entitlement to termination payments. They are eligible to receive performance bonuses when key corporate 
targets are attained.  
Each of the non-executive directors has a written contract for services, terminable at one month's notice.  
Other than these, there are no arrangements in force whereby the group is under an obligation to pay fees, salaries, 
bonuses, pensions or any remuneration to any director. In addition there are no agreements with any director or 
employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover except that 
provisions of the share scheme may cause options and awards granted to employees under such schemes and plans to 
vest on a takeover.
