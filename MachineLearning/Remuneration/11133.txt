Corporate Governance 2011 
 
Anglesey Mining plc 14 
Principles 
The board bases its policies and practices in relation to corporate governance on the 2008 Financial Reporting Council 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code ). The group has made use of the Guidance for Smaller Quoted 
Companies published by the Quoted Companies Alliance in 2004 which relates to the implementation of corporate 
governance for smaller quoted companies. 
The board supports the highest standards in corporate governance and endeavours to implement the principles of the 
Combined Code constructively and in a sensible and pragmatic fashion with the objective of enhancing and protecting 
shareholder value. This is always harder in a small group than in the larger organisations with which the Combined 
Code is chiefly concerned. It is particularly problematic for a group such as Anglesey which is both small and engaged 
in mineral development rather than more routine trading operations.  
The Board  
The board is responsible for formulating, reviewing and approving the company's strategy, financial activities and 
operating performance. Day to day management is devolved to the executive directors who are charged with 
consulting the board on all significant financial and operational matters. In this way decisions can be made promptly, 
but also with consultation amongst the directors concerned where necessary and appropriate. 
The board comprises three executive directors and four non-executive directors, a structure which the board 
considers to be appropriate. For the purposes of the Combined Code Howard Miller is the senior independent non-
executive director and David Lean and Roger Turner are independent directors. Danesh Varma is not deemed to be 
independent. Howard Miller and David Lean have now served for more than nine years as independent non-executive 
directors however it is the board's opinion, after reviewing all the relevant factors, that this does not disqualify them 
from categorisation as independent directors. There are cases where board members are also directors of other 
companies; the board does not believe that these instances in any way compromise the independence or ability of the 
directors to carry out their duties in respect of the company.  
The board meets when required and all board members are supplied with relevant and timely information. The 
company's strategy is always determined by the whole board and the schedule of matters reserved to the board is 
therefore comprehensive. The board approves detailed budgets and activities and any material changes to budgets or 
planned activities are also approved by the whole board.  
There is an established procedure by which directors may, at the company's expense, take independent advice in the 
furtherance of their duties. They also have access to the advice and services of the company secretary who is charged 
with ensuring that board procedures are followed.  
There is a system for the board to monitor its own performance, including that of the board committees, and a 
programme to develop directors' skills and expertise. 
There are written terms of reference for the remuneration, audit and nomination committees, each of which deals 
with specific aspects of the group's affairs. The board receives periodic reports from all committees.  
The matter of going concern is dealt with in the directors' report.  
Remuneration committee 
The remuneration committee comprises Howard Miller and Danesh Varma. It is responsible for making 
recommendations to the board on the company's executive remuneration. The committee determines any contract 
terms, remuneration and other benefits, including share options, for each of the executive directors. The board itself 
determines the remuneration of the non-executive directors and directors may not vote in respect of their own 
remuneration. The report on directors' remuneration is set out in the previous section.  
Audit committee 
The committee's terms of reference have been approved by the board and follow published guidelines. The audit 
committee comprises Danesh Varma and David Lean. Both are chartered accountants with extensive mineral industry 
experience and have the necessary recent and relevant experience required by the Combined Code. 
The audit committee reviews the half-yearly and annual accounts before they are presented to the board, focusing in 
particular on accounting policies and areas of management judgement and estimation. The committee is responsible 
for monitoring the controls which are in force to ensure the information reported to the shareholders is accurate and 
complete. The committee discusses internal control issues and contributes to the board's review of the effectiveness 
of the group's internal control and risk management systems. It also considers the need for an internal audit function, 
which it believes is not required at present due to the limited staff and operations of the group. The members of the 
committee have agreed to make themselves available should any member of staff wish to make representations to 
them about the conduct of the affairs of the group.  
The committee advises the board on the appointment of external auditors and on their remuneration for both audit 
and non-audit work, and discusses the nature and scope of the audit with the external auditors. It meets formally at
