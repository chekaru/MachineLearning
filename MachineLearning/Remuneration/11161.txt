  
Directors' Remuneration Report 2014 
 
Anglesey Mining plc 10 
The Directors' Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 as amended in August 2013. As a result of the August 
2013 amendments the format has changed from that used in the group's last annual report.  
Until 31 July 2013 the remuneration committee comprised Howard Miller (chairman) and Danesh Varma; with effect 
from 1 August 2013 Roger Turner replaced Danesh Varma. No remuneration consultants were employed.  
The company's share option scheme was adopted in 2004 and will expire in October 2014. Consequently a new 
scheme with very similar provisions is being proposed for adoption at the AGM.  
Statement by the chair of the Remuneration Committee 
Although this report is substantially different from that presented last year, the group's policies with regard to 
directors' remuneration, which are set out below, have not changed. While the group is at its current stage of 
development  the committee considers that no policy changes are necessary or appropriate; the group needs to retain 
its executives while also conserving its resources for the tasks which lie ahead. The committee believes that the 
existing structure is the best way to do that in the current circumstances and for the year ahead.  
H. B. Miller 
Chairman, Remuneration Committee 
30 July 2014 
Directors' remuneration policy  
The statement of the directors' remuneration policy comprising the following four paragraphs will be put to 
shareholders for approval at the annual general meeting on 30 September 2014 and, if approved, will take effect 
following that meeting. 
The board's aim, implemented by the remuneration committee, with regard to executive and non-executive 
directors' remuneration, is to provide a package which will attract, retain and motivate directors of the 
calibre required and be consistent with the group's ability to pay. So far as is possible, it is the group's policy 
to keep contract durations, notice periods and termination payments to a minimum. In practice, for 
executive directors, this results in rolling 12 month contracts.  
A bonus for attainment of key corporate targets forms part of overall executive director remuneration and 
share options form a major part of executive directors' remuneration.  
Share options were granted to non-executive directors in the past however a fee payment is now being made 
to non-executive directors and future share option grants will be reduced or eliminated accordingly. At 
present there are no pension contributions of any type. There have been no new appointments during the 
year and the committee has not recommended any changes to existing remuneration packages.  
The company has one active share scheme, the 2004 Unapproved Share Option Scheme. All directors and 
employees are eligible to receive options. In determining the amount of options to be granted to each 
individual, the directors take into account the need for and value of the services provided, the amount of 
time spent on the business of the group and any other remuneration receivable from the group. All share 
options are subject to a performance criterion, namely that the company's share price performance over the 
period from grant to exercise must exceed that of the companies in the top quartile of the FTSE 100 index. 
This index was selected as being an easily available benchmark of general corporate performance.  
Annual report on remuneration 
Terms and conditions of service 
John Kearney, the chairman, does not receive fees; he has been remunerated by the grant of options over the 
company's shares.  
Bill Hooley has written terms of employment with rolling notice periods of 12 months and no other entitlement to 
termination or bonus payments.  
Ian Cuthbertson retired from the board on 31 July 2013 and Danesh Varma became finance director from that date 
forward.  
Each of the non-executive directors has a written contract for services, terminable at one month's notice.  
It is group policy that the period of notice for executive directors will not exceed 12 months and that the employment 
contracts of the executive directors are terminable at 364 days' notice by either party. The contracts of executive 
directors do not provide for any enhanced payments in the event of a change of control of the company, nor for 
liquidated damages. All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with the company for an initial period of 
three years from their date of appointment, subject to reappointment at the AGM and thereafter can be terminated 
with one month's notice.

Other than these, there are no arrangements in force whereby the group is under an obligation to pay fees, salaries, 
bonuses, pensions or any remuneration to any director. In addition there are no agreements with any director or 
employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover except that 
provisions of the share scheme may result in options granted to employees under such schemes vesting on a takeover.

All of these interests are beneficial. Ian Cuthbertson retired as a director on 31 July 2013. 
Relative importance of spend on pay 
The total pay for the year ended 31 March 2014 was  97,333 and for the year ended 31 March 2013 it was  100,000. 
The change between the years is a reduction of 3%. There are no dividends or distributions with which to compare 
this reduction and no relevant performance related pay to consider.  
Statement of voting at general meeting 
The voting in respect of the approval of the directors' remuneration report at the annual general meeting held on 24 
September 2013 was as follows: for the resolution 99.96%, against the resolution 0.01% and withheld votes 0.03%.  
Future remuneration policy 
The rates of remuneration and pay structures of the three executive directors to be considered in the future 
remuneration policy have not changed for several years. There is no current intention to change them and 
consequently the information which would normally constitute the future policy table has not been provided.  
Awards under previous remuneration policies 
Any awards or remuneration-related commitments made to directors under previous remuneration policies will 
continue to be honoured. 
Approach to recruitment remuneration 
In considering the remuneration levels for new directors, the remuneration committee takes into account the market 
rate for similar roles, as well as considering the emoluments offered to existing and previous directors. 
No compensation is normally offered for the forfeit of remuneration from previous employment. However, under 
exceptional circumstances, a one-off award may be made to a newly appointed executive director. Any such award 
will be made on a like-for-like basis, with a fair-value no higher than that of the awards forfeited after taking into 
account any conditions that would apply. 
Where a director is appointed as a result of internal promotion, any contractual commitments made prior to their 
promotion would be honoured, where appropriate. 
When recruiting a new non-executive director, the board would determine the appropriate fee level in line with the 
policy stated above. 
Service contracts 
Executive directors currently have employment contracts which may be terminated by the employer or employee at 
twelve months' notice. No other payments are made for loss of office. Other than payment for this notice period, 
there are no payments for directors that are triggered by a change of control, nor are there any other remuneration-
related contractual provisions such as side-letters. 
Each director has a formal letter of appointment setting out their duties and responsibilities. These letters are 
available for inspection at the registered office.

In these charts the  Base' represents the current annual salary and the value of any benefits received; the  Target' 
and  Maximum' columns also include any additional amounts which might be receivable in bonuses, which at present 
are not expected to arise.   
Policy on loss of office 
Generally any severance payments on termination are limited to established contractual arrangements only. Any 
payment in lieu of notice would be limited to salary and benefits, and subject to mitigation.  
A director who leaves the group in good standing would generally be entitled to receive an appropriate proportion of 
any potential bonus and would retain any share options for up to one year following his departure, subject to the 
rules of the share option scheme.  
In the event of a change of control, awards may vest, subject to pro-rating for the proportion of the vesting period 
elapsed and the extent to which performance conditions are determined to have been achieved. The remuneration 
committee will retain discretion to adjust awards, within any relevant plan rules to ensure fairness for participants 
and shareholders. 
Difference between director remuneration policy and that for other employees 
There are no senior executives at present who are not directors. Remuneration policy for other employees would be 
consistent with that for the executive directors. There were no employees to be consulted when directors' 
remuneration policies were established.  
Consideration of employment conditions 
When setting directors' remuneration, the remuneration and overall conditions for other employees would be taken 
into account. 
Consideration of shareholder views 
The remuneration committee would consult with major shareholders when considering any significant changes to 
remuneration policy and practices.
