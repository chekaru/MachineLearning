 Summary remuneration report
for the year ended 31 December 2005
In the case of the directors and top tier of management, half of the
bonus is payable in cash. From 2006, the cash element has been
adjusted to 90% (from 75%) of basic salary in the case of the chief
executive and to 75% (from 60%) of basic salary for the other
executive directors to sustain a competitive market position with
companies of a similar size and complexity. The maximum bonus would
only be paid for meeting targets which, in the opinion of the
Committee, represent an exceptional performance for the Group and
take account of the increased bonus potential. The other half of the
bonus is in the form of a conditional award of Bonus Shares equal in
value to the cash element. To encourage retention, Bonus Shares vest
only if the participant remains in employment with the Group until the
end of a three-year holding period, or (if having left during the holding
period) is, in the view of the Committee, deemed to be a good leaver.
The maximum potential of the Enhancement Shares is 75% of the face
value of the Bonus Shares (i.e. in the case of the CEO a maximum of
56% of basic salary). Awards will vest after three years only to the
extent that a challenging performance condition (based on EPS growth)
has been met.
On a change of control of the Company, Bonus Shares would be
released and Enhancement Shares would vest, to the extent that 
the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied. The BSP 
is not pensionable.
In 2005 the BSP was extended to all those tiers of management
globally who were previously eligible to receive share options.
Other long term incentive plans (L TIP)
Conditional LTIP awards continue to be made annually to executive
directors. The maximum grant level under the LTIP is 200% salary. It is
anticipated that in 2006, grants under the LTIP will be made at 200%
salary for the chief executive and 175% salary for the other directors. 
The Committee is content that the performance conditions that need to
be satisfied for these awards to vest in full are sufficiently stretching in
the context of the award levels. In determining annual award levels, the
Committee also gives consideration to market competitiveness and has
set the levels taking account of median expected value of long term
incentives relative to other companies. These awards are discretionary
and considered on a case-by-case basis. 
The LTIP closely aligns the interests of the shareholders and executive
directors by rewarding superior shareholder and financial performance
and by encouraging executives to build up a shareholding in Anglo
American plc.
Within five years of their appointment, executive directors are expected
to acquire a holding of shares with a value of two times' basic salary in
the case of the chief executive and one times' basic salary in the case
of other executive directors.
The vesting of LTIP awards made during 2005 is subject to the
achievement of stretching performance targets, relating to Total
Shareholder Return (TSR) and to an operating measure, currently Return
on Capital Employed (ROCE), over a fixed three year period. Half of
each award is subject to a Group TSR measure, while the other half is
subject to a Group ROCE measure. These performance measures were
selected on the basis that they clearly foster the creation of shareholder
value. There is no retesting of performance.

Remuneration Committee
Anglo American has a Remuneration Committee (the Committee)
consisting of independent non-executive directors, chaired by 
Rob Margetts, which is responsible for considering and making
recommendations to the Board on executive and senior management
remuneration policy, specific remuneration packages for executive
directors and the design and operation of the Company's share
incentive schemes.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
Each executive director's total remuneration consists of salary, annual
bonus, long-term incentives and benefits. The basic salary of the
executive directors is reviewed annually and is targeted at the median
of companies of comparable size, market sector, business complexity
and international scope. Company performance, individual performance
and changes in responsibilities are also taken into consideration in
setting salary levels at the end of each year. An appropriate balance is
maintained between fixed and performance-related remuneration and
between elements linked to short-term financial performance and those
linked to longer-term shareholder value creation. Assuming on-target
performance, the Committee's policy is that at least 50% (60% for the
CEO) or more of total executive director remuneration is performance-
related. In 2005, on average, 64% of executive directors' actual
remuneration on an expected value basis was performance-related.
Bonus Share Plan
The Bonus Share Plan (BSP) was first operated in 2004 and all
executive directors are eligible to participate in it. The BSP requires
executive directors to invest a significant proportion of their
remuneration in shares, thereby more closely aligning their interests
with those of shareholders, and encourages management at all levels
to build up a meaningful personal stake in the Company. Awards under
the BSP are made annually and consist of three elements: a
performance-related cash element, Bonus Shares as a conditional
award to a value equal to the cash element and an additional
performance-related element in the form of Enhancement Shares. 
The value of the bonus is calculated by reference to achievement
against annual performance targets which include measures of
corporate and, where applicable, business unit performance as well as
the achievement of specific individual objectives. For executive
directors, the corporate element is based on demanding Earnings Per
Share (EPS) targets. In 2005 the EPS targets were met in full. It is the
Committee's usual policy to base at least 50% of each annual bonus
award on the corporate or business measure and the remaining
percentage on key personal performance measures. The level of
bonuses payable will be reduced if certain overall safety improvement
targets are not met. 
The Committee reviews these measures annually to ensure they remain
appropriate and sufficiently stretching in the context of the economic
and performance expectations for the Company and its operating
businesses. 
Anglo American plc Annual Review 2005 | 29 Summary remuneration report continued
as being a broad equity market index consisting of companies of
comparable size and complexity to Anglo American plc. In drawing 
this graph, it has been assumed that all dividends paid have been 
re-invested. This graph has been produced in accordance with the
requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
Pensions
Each executive director participated in a defined contribution pension
scheme and two of the executive directors are also active members of
defined benefit pension schemes in South Africa. In the light of the new
UK pensions regime, which will apply from 6 April 2006, the Committee
has decided that, should an executive director request that his contract
be altered for service after 6 April 2006 so that further pension
benefits are reduced or cease to accrue, a pension allowance would be
paid to him at the same value as his defined contribution benefits
thereby forgone. Similarly, the Committee has decided that it will
consider requests from executive directors that their contracts be
altered for future service, so that supplementary pension contributions
are made into their defined contribution pension arrangements, in
return for the executive directors giving up their right to part of their
future basic salary and/or cash element of the BSP.
Executive directors' service contracts
In order properly to reflect their spread of responsibilities, Tony Trahar
and David Hathorn have contracts with Anglo American International
(IOM) Limited and with Anglo Operations Limited. The salaries under
these contracts are payable in sterling and/or South African rand as
appropriate. Ren  M dori is employed by Anglo American
International (IOM) Limited and Simon Thompson is employed by
Anglo American Services (UK) Limited. The employment contracts of
all executive directors are terminable at 12 months' notice by either
party. The Committee has taken note that the inclusion of liquidated
damages clauses is no longer in complete compliance with the latest
ABI guidelines and, as market practice has now moved away from
the inclusion of such clauses in service contracts, the contracts of
David Hathorn, Ren  M dori and Simon Thompson do not include
this provision.
Non-executive directors' remuneration and 
service contracts
Non-executive director remuneration is set at a level which is intended
to be sufficient to attract and retain world-class non-executive talent
and consistent with recognised best practice. Non-executive directors
may not participate in the Company's BSP, LTIP or pension
arrangements. The Board reviews non-executive directors' fees
periodically to ensure they remain market-competitive. All non-
executive directors have letters of appointment with Anglo American
plc for an initial period of three years from their date of appointment,
subject to re-election at the AGM.
For awards made prior to and including 2004, vesting of the TSR part of
the LTIP varies according to the Company's TSR over the performance
period relative to a weighted basket of international resources
companies (the Sector Index). However, from the 2005 award, to
reflect better the Company's diverse shareholder base, the portion of
each award that is based on TSR will now be measured 50% against
the Sector Index and 50% against the constituents of the FTSE 100.
Also from the 2005 award, to avoid problems arising from the
distorting effect of single-commodity companies, the definition of
above-target performance levels for the sector comparator group has
been adjusted. As a result of these changes, maximum vesting on the
TSR element of an award will only be possible if Anglo American
outperforms by a substantial margin both the sector benchmark and the
largest UK companies across all sectors. To achieve maximum vesting
for the whole LTIP award the Company would, in addition, have to
exceed demanding ROCE targets. These represent an extremely
challenging set of performance hurdles.
The Sector Index mentioned above comprises a weighted basket of
international resources companies. For awards made in 2005, the
companies constituting this index were as follows:
Mining Paper and Packaging Industrial Minerals
Category 
weighting 80% 12% 8%
Comparator BHP Billiton plc Sappi Limited CRH plc
companies Falconbridge
Limited SCA Hanson plc
Rio Tinto plc Stora Enso Oyj Holcim Limited
Vedanta Resources Lafarge
plc UPM-Kymmene Group
Xstrata plc
The LTIP closely aligns the interests of shareholders and executive
directors by rewarding superior shareholder and financial performance
and by encouraging executives to build up a shareholding in Anglo
American plc. 
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the number of
shares that vest under the LTIP will be calculated by reference to the
extent to which the applicable performance conditions have been met
at the time of the change of control.

2004 Remuneration Report, a special contribution of  5,600,000 was also made into the defined contribution scheme in 2005 in respect of the
pension benefits of T ony T rahar, being the actuarially-determined value necessary to replace the final salary pension benefits forgone by him. Further
details of these schemes are contained in the Remuneration Report in the 2005 Annual Report.
