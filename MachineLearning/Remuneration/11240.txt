1.  Remuneration Committee
This report sets out the Company's remuneration policy and practice for executive directors. It provides 
details of the remuneration and share interests of all executive directors and non-executive directors for the 
year ended 31 December 2006.
1.1 Role of the Remuneration Committee and Terms of Reference
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is responsible for considering and making recommendations 
to the Board on: 
 
 the Company's general policy on executive and senior management remuneration;
 
 the specifi c remuneration packages for executive directors of the Company, including basic salary, 
performance-based short and long term incentives, pensions and other benefi ts; and
 
 the design and operation of the Company's share incentive schemes.
The full Terms of Reference of the Committee can be found on the Anglo American website (www.
angloamerican.co.uk) and copies are available on request. The Committee met six times during 2006.
1.2 Membership of the Committee 
The Committee comprised the following non-executive directors during the year ended 31 December 2006: 
 
 Sir Rob Margetts (chairman);
 
 David Challen;
 
 Chris Fay; 
 
 Sir Mark Moody-Stuart (from 1 December 2006); and
 
 Fred Phaswana (until 1 November 2006).
The Company's chief executive attends the Committee meetings by invitation and assists the Committee in 
its considerations, except when issues relating to his own compensation are discussed. No directors are 
involved in deciding their own remuneration. In 2006, the Committee was advised by Russell King and Chris 
Corrin (Group Human Resources) and the Company's Finance function. It also took external advice from:

2. Remuneration policy on executive directors' remuneration
The Company's remuneration policy is formulated to attract and retain high-calibre executives and motivate 
them to develop and implement the Company's business strategy in order to optimise long term shareholder 
value creation. It is the intention that this policy should conform to best practice standards and that it will 
continue to apply for 2007 and subsequent years, subject to ongoing review as appropriate. The policy is 
framed around the following key principles:
 
 total rewards will be set at levels that are suffi ciently competitive to enable the recruitment and 
retention of high-calibre executives;
 
 total incentive-based rewards will be earned through the achievement of demanding performance 
conditions consistent with shareholder interests;
 
 incentive plans, performance measures and targets will be structured to operate soundly throughout 
the business cycle;
 
 the design of long term incentives will be prudent and will not expose shareholders to unreasonable 
fi nancial risk;
 
 in considering the market positioning of reward elements, account will be taken of the performance 
of the Company and of the individual executive director; and
 
 reward practice will conform to best practice standards as far as reasonably practicable. 
Representatives of the Company's principal investors are consulted on changes to remuneration policy.
3. Elements of executive director remuneration
3.1 Remuneration mix
Each executive director's total remuneration consists of salary, annual bonus, long term incentives and 
benefi ts. An appropriate balance is maintained between fi xed and performance-related remuneration and 
between elements linked to short term fi nancial performance and those linked to longer term shareholder 
value creation.
Assuming on-target performance, the Committee's policy is that at least 50% (60% for the chief executive) 
or more of total executive director remuneration is performance-related. In 2006, 69% of the chief 
executive's remuneration on an expected-value basis was performance-related; for the other executive 
directors, on average, the fi gure was 64% (see illustrative charts).
The Bonus Share Plan (BSP) and the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) are designed to align the longer term 
interests of shareholders and executives and to underpin the Company's performance culture. The 
Committee monitors the relevance and appropriateness of the performance measures and targets applicable 
to both plans. Further details of the BSP and of the LTIP are set out below and on page 68.
3.2 Basic salary
The basic salary of the executive directors is reviewed annually and is targeted at the market median of 
companies of comparable size, market sector, business complexity and international scope. This is adjusted 
either way based on experience and other relevant factors. The market for executives of main board calibre, 
in large international resource companies in particular, is currently very competitive and it is therefore 
deemed sensible to position basic salary for executive directors at no lower than the median point. 
Company performance, individual performance and changes in responsibilities are also taken into 
consideration in setting salary levels each year.
3.3 Bonus Share Plan (BSP)
The BSP was fi rst operated in 2004 and all executive directors are normally eligible to participate in it.
The BSP requires executive directors to invest a signifi cant proportion of their remuneration in shares, 
thereby more closely aligning their interest with those of shareholders, and encourages management at all 
levels to build up a meaningful personal stake in the Company. Awards under the BSP are made annually 
and consist of three elements:
 
 a performance-related cash element;
 
 Bonus Shares as a conditional award to a value equal to the cash element; and
 
 an additional performance-related element in the form of Enhancement Shares.

These bonus awards are not pensionable. The BSP operates as follows:
 
 the value of the bonus is calculated by reference to achievement against annual performance targets 
which include measures of corporate (and, where applicable, business unit) performance as well as 
the achievement of specifi c individual objectives. For executive directors, the corporate element is 
based on stretching Earnings Per Share (EPS) targets which are calculated using underlying earnings 
(reconciled in note 11 of the fi nancial statements). The key individual objectives are designed to 
support the Company's strategic priorities and in 2006 included safety improvement, strategy 
implementation, production growth, people management, succession planning, cost reduction and 
operational effi ciencies;
 
 the Committee reviews these measures annually to ensure they remain appropriate and suffi ciently 
stretching in the context of the economic and performance expectations for the Company and its 
operating businesses;
 
 in 2006, 60% of each annual bonus was based on the corporate or business measure and the remaining 
40% on key personal performance measures. The level of bonuses payable is reduced if certain overall 
safety improvement targets are not met. Bonus parameters are set on an individual basis;
 
 in the case of the directors and top tier of management, half of the bonus is payable in cash. The 
maximum cash element has been 90% of basic salary in the case of the chief executive and 75% of 
basic salary for the other executive directors (from 2007, the maximum cash element for the new chief 
executive will be 75% as outlined on page 74). The maximum bonus would only be paid for meeting 
targets which, in the opinion of the Committee, represent an exceptional performance for the Group. 
The other half of the bonus is in the form of a conditional award of Bonus Shares equal in value to the 
cash element. These Bonus Shares vest only if the participant remains in employment with the Group 
until the end of a three-year holding period (or is regarded by the Committee as a  good leaver'); and
 
 in order to encourage continuing focus on medium term performance, executive directors also receive 
a conditional award of Enhancement Shares at the same time as the award of Bonus Shares. The 
maximum potential, at face value, of the Enhancement Shares is 75% of the face value of the Bonus 
Shares (i.e. in the case of the chief executive a maximum of 68% of basic salary). Awards of 
Enhancement Shares made in 2006 will vest after three years only to the extent that a challenging 
performance condition (real EPS growth, based on earnings per share growth against growth in the UK 
Retail Price Index (RPI)) is met (see illustrative chart).
Real EPS growth is viewed as the most appropriate performance measure for this element of the BSP 
because it is a fundamental fi nancial performance indicator, both internally and externally, and links directly 
to the Company's long term objective of improving earnings. The targets have been approved by the 
Committee after reviewing performance over a number of years and have been set at a level which provides 
stretching performance levels for management. At the end of each performance period, the level of 
performance achieved and the proportion of awards vesting will be published in the subsequent 
remuneration report.
3.4 Share options and all-employee share schemes
No share options were granted to executive directors under the Company's Executive Share Option Scheme 
(ESOS) in 2006 and there is no intention to make future grants under the ESOS to executive directors. 
However, the ESOS is retained for use in special circumstances relating to the recruitment or retention of 
key executives.
Executive directors remain eligible to participate in the Company's Save As You Earn (SAYE) and Share 
Incentive Plan (SIP) schemes. As these schemes are offered to all UK employees, performance conditions 
do not apply to them.
3.5 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Grant levels
Conditional LTIP awards are made annually to executive directors. The maximum grant level under the LTIP 
is 200% of basic salary. It is anticipated that in 2007, grants under the LTIP will be made at 175% of basic 
salary for all the executive directors, including the new chief executive. The Committee is content that the 
performance conditions that need to be satisfi ed for these awards to vest in full are suffi ciently stretching in 
the context of the award levels. In determining annual award levels, the Committee also gives consideration 
to market competitiveness and has set the levels taking account of median expected value of long term 
incentives relative to other companies of a similar size. These awards are discretionary and considered on 
a case-by-case basis.
Performance measures
As in previous years, vesting of the LTIP awards made during 2006 is subject to the achievement of 
stretching performance targets relating to Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and to an operating measure, 
currently return on capital employed (ROCE), over a fi xed three-year period.
ANGLO AMERICAN plc
ANNUAL REPORT 2006
REMUNERATION REPORT Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 | 69
    
Half of each award is subject to a Group TSR measure while the other half is subject to a Group ROCE 
measure. These performance measures were selected on the basis that they clearly foster the creation 
of shareholder value and their appropriateness is kept under review by the Committee. At the end of 
each performance period, the level of ROCE performance achieved and the level of award earned will 
be published in the subsequent remuneration report. There is no retesting of performance.
The LTIP closely aligns the interests of shareholders and executive directors by rewarding superior 
shareholder return and fi nancial performance and by encouraging executives to build up a shareholding 
in the Company.
Total shareholder return (TSR)
The Committee considers comparative TSR to be a suitable long term performance measure for the 
Company's LTIP awards. Executives would benefi t only if shareholders have enjoyed returns on their 
investment which are superior to those that could have been obtained in other comparable companies.
For awards made from 2005 onwards, the portion of each award that is based on TSR is measured 50% 
against the Sector Index and 50% against the constituents of the FTSE 100. Maximum vesting on the TSR 
element of an award will only be possible if Anglo American outperforms by a substantial margin both the 
sector benchmark (as described below) and the largest UK companies across all sectors. Maximum vesting 
of the whole LTIP award, would, in addition, depend on the Company's performance exceeding demanding 
ROCE targets (also as described below). Taken as a whole, vesting depends on a very challenging set of 
performance hurdles.
Sector Index comparison
One half of the TSR element of an LTIP award vests according to the Company's TSR over the performance 
period, relative to a weighted basket of international natural resource companies (the Sector Index). Up until 
the end of 2006, the Sector Index comprised three categories: the fi rst consisted of six international 
diversifi ed mining companies, the second of four international paper and packaging companies, and the third 
of four international industrial minerals companies. From the start of 2007 the paper and packaging element 
will no longer be part of the Index because of the imminent demerger of the Group's paper and packaging 
division. The Committee may amend the list of comparator companies in the Sector Index, and relative 
weightings, if circumstances make this necessary (for example, as a result of takeovers or mergers of 
comparator companies). In calculating TSR it is assumed that all dividends are reinvested.
For awards made in 2006, the companies constituting the Sector Index were as follows (up until 
31 December 2006. After this date the percentage attributable to Paper and Packaging will fall to zero):
Mining Paper and Packaging Industrial Minerals
Category weighting 78% 13% 9%
Comparator companies BHP Billiton plc
CVRD
Rio Tinto plc
Teck Cominco
Vedanta Resources plc
Xstrata plc
Sappi Limited
SCA
Stora Enso Oyj
UPM-Kymmene Group
CRH plc
Hanson plc
Holcim Limited
Lafarge
Target performance for the Sector Index is assessed by calculating the median TSR performance within each 
sub-sector category, and then weighting these medians by the category weightings shown above. 
Shares contingent upon the Sector Index element of the TSR performance will vest as follows:
The Company's relative TSR compared to the Sector Index % Proportion of TSR element vesting
Below Target 0
Target (matching the weighted median of the Sector Index) 20
Target plus 5% per annum 50
Target plus 7.5% per annum (or above) 75
Shares will vest on a straight-line basis for performance between the levels shown in the table above. | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 70
FTSE 100 Comparison
The vesting of the other half of the TSR element of an LTIP award will depend on the Company's TSR 
performance over the performance period compared with the constituents of the FTSE 100 Index, as follows:
The Company's relative TSR compared to the FTSE 100 % Proportion of TSR element vesting
Below the median TSR of the FTSE 100 0
Equal to the median TSR of the FTSE 100 20
Equal to the 90th percentile TSR of the FTSE 100 50
Above the 90th percentile TSR of the FTSE 100 75
Shares will vest on a straight-line basis for performance between the levels shown in the table above.
The targets above were calibrated such that for the TSR element of the award there is approximately a 10% 
chance of achieving full vesting and a 25% chance of two-thirds vesting. These probabilities were assessed 
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP using the same Monte Carlo model used for calculating fair values of the 
LTIP under IFRS 2 Share-based payments. The estimated average fair value of an award under the TSR 
element is 48% of the value of shares awarded.
Graphs showing the Company's TSR performance against the weighted average of the Sector Index and 
against the FTSE 100 for the fi ve years from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2006 can be found on 
page 73.
Return on capital employed
Group ROCE is the second performance measure for LTIP grants. The Committee considers this to be among 
the most important factors which drive sustainable improvements in shareholder value in a natural resources 
business, as well as one of the most important measures of differentiation in performance in this sector.
The proportion of shares vesting based on Group ROCE will vary according to the degree of improvement 
in the Group's average annualised ROCE over the performance period. Unless certain minimum targets 
for improvement in returns (on both capital employed for the fi nancial year preceding the start of the 
performance period (existing capital employed) and on the additional capital employed during the 
performance period (incremental capital employed)), no shares will vest under this performance measure. 
The maximum ROCE targets are based on stretching levels of return on the existing capital employed.
The ROCE targets for each element conditionally awarded in 2006 are shown below. These are adjusted for 
movements in commodity prices, certain foreign exchange rate effects, capital in progress and for relevant 
changes in the composition of the Group.
Existing capital employed Incremental capital employed
Minimum ROCE Target 21.3% 10%
Maximum ROCE Target 23.3% 10%
The ROCE elements of the award vest as shown in the table below:
Proportion of ROCE element vesting
Below or equal to the Minimum Target 0%
Equal to or greater than the Maximum Target 100%
Shares will vest on a straight-line basis for performance between the Minimum Target and the 
Maximum Target.

3.6 Vesting of share incentives in the event of change of control or termination of employment
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the following provisions apply under the Company's 
incentive plans:
 
 share options granted under the former ESOS may be exercised irrespective of whether the applicable 
performance conditions have been met;
 
 the number of shares that vest under the LTIP will be calculated by reference to the extent to which the 
applicable performance conditions have been met at the time of the change of control;
 
 Bonus Shares awarded under the BSP will be released, but Enhancement Shares awarded under the BSP 
will vest on change of control, to the extent that the performance condition has been met at the time of 
the change of control;
 
 SAYE options may be exercised (to the extent of savings at the date of exercise); and
 
 participants may direct the SIP trustee as to how to deal with their SIP shares (although Matching 
Shares may be forfeited in some circumstances).
In the event that a director's employment is terminated, vesting of outstanding share options under the 
former ESOS is dependent upon the reasons the contract is terminated. Performance conditions fall away 
in the event of redundancy. However, if the executive resigns voluntarily, then all such options lapse unless 
the Committee determines otherwise.
In the case of LTIP interests, if a director resigns voluntarily, then his interests lapse. If he is made redundant, 
vesting at the end of the performance period is based on the normal performance criteria and then pro rated 
for the proportion of the performance period for which the director served. 
In the case of the BSP, if a director ceases to be employed before the end of the year in respect of which the 
annual performance targets apply, then no award will be made unless the Committee determines otherwise 
(taking into account the proportion of the year for which the director was an employee of the Group and
of performance to date against the annual performance targets at the date of cessation). If a director 
resigns voluntarily before the end of the three-year vesting period, the Bonus Share awards lapse and the 
Enhancement Shares are forfeited. If a director is made redundant, Bonus Share awards will be transferred 
as soon as practicable after the date of leaving and the Enhancement Shares will vest at the end of the 
performance period, to the extent that the performance conditions have been met. 
3.7 Employee Share Ownership Trust and policy on provision of shares for incentive schemes
The Group established an Employee Share Ownership Trust (the Trust) in 1999 to acquire and hold shares 
to facilitate the operation of the Company's share schemes. As at 31 December 2006, the trust held 
19,856,385 ordinary shares in the Company, registered in the name of Greenwood Nominees Limited. 
Shares held by the trust are not voted at the Company's general meetings. It is the Company's current 
policy and practice not to use newly issued shares to meet the requirements of share incentives. Such 
shares are provided from the Trust or from Treasury or by market purchase.
3.8 Pensions
Pension and life insurance benefi ts for executive directors refl ect practice in the countries in which they 
perform their principal duties. Details of individual pension arrangements are set out on pages 79 and 80.
During the year, in the light of the new UK pensions regime which applied from 6 April 2006, the 
Committee decided that it would consider requests from executive directors that their contracts be altered 
for future service, so that further pension benefi ts are reduced or cease to accrue and that a pension 
allowance be paid having the same value as the defi ned contribution benefi ts forgone.
Similarly, the Committee decided that it would consider requests from executive directors (as is the case 
for employees more generally) that their contracts be altered for future service, so that supplementary 
pension contributions are made into their defi ned contribution pension arrangements, in return for 
equivalent value reductions in their future basic salary and/or the cash element of the BSP.
3.9 Other benefi ts
Executive directors are entitled to the provision of either a car allowance or a fully expensed car, medical 
insurance, death and disability insurance, social club membership (in accordance with local market practice), 
limited personal taxation/fi nancial advice and reimbursement of reasonable business expenses. The 
provision of these benefi ts is considered to be market-competitive in the appropriate locality for executive 
director positions. | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 72
4. Executive shareholding targets
Within fi ve years of their appointment, executive directors are expected to acquire a holding of shares with 
a value of two times' basic salary in the case of the chief executive and one times' basic salary in the case 
of other executive directors.
The Committee takes into consideration achievement against these targets when making grants under the 
Company's various long term incentive plans.
At 31 December 2006, all executive directors with more than one year's service on the Board had met or 
exceeded their shareholding targets. 
5. External appointments
Executive directors are not permitted to hold external directorships or offi ces without the approval of the 
Board; if approved, they may each retain the fees payable from one such appointment. During the year 
ended 31 December 2006, Ren  M dori retained fees from one such appointment, amounting to  47,000.
6. Policy on non-executive directors' remuneration
Non-executive directors' remuneration is approved by the Board as a whole on the recommendation of the 
chairman and executive directors.
The Company's policy on non-executive directors' remuneration is based on the following key principles:
 
 Remuneration should be: 
 
   suffi cient to attract and retain world-class non-executive talent; 
 
   consistent with recognised best practice standards for non-executive directors' remuneration;
 
   in the form of cash fees, but with the fl exibility to forgo all or part of such fees to acquire shares in 
the Company if the non-executive director so wishes (after deduction of applicable income tax and 
social security contributions); and 
 
   set by reference to the responsibilities taken on by the non-executives in chairing the Board and its 
committees. 
 
 Non-executive directors may not participate in the Company's BSP, share option schemes, LTIP or 
pension arrangements.
The Board reviews non-executive directors' fees periodically to ensure they remain market-competitive. 
Additional fees are paid to the chairmen of Board committees and to the senior independent director (SID). 
Where non-executive directors have Executive Board roles within subsidiaries of the Company, then they 
may also receive additional remuneration on account of these increased responsibilities. With the exception 
of Bobby Godsell, who is remunerated by AngloGold Ashanti Limited in his capacity as its chief executive, 
none of the non-executive directors has any such role.
7. Chairman's fees
The chairman's fees are reviewed periodically (on a different cycle from the review of non-executive 
directors' fees). A recommendation is then made to the Board (in the absence of the chairman) by the 
Committee and chief executive, who take external advice on market comparators.
8. Directors' service contracts
Cynthia Carroll and Simon Thompson are employed by Anglo American Services (UK) Limited; Tony Trahar 
and David Hathorn have contracts with Anglo American International (IOM) Limited and with Anglo 
Operations Limited and Ren  M dori is employed by Anglo American International (IOM) Limited. It is
the Company's policy that the period of notice for executive directors will not exceed 12 months and the 
employment contracts of all executive directors except that of Cynthia Carroll are terminable at 12 months' 
notice by either party. As part of Cynthia Carroll's terms upon joining the Company, her initial notice period 
will be 24 months, which will reduce to 12 months after the initial 12 month period.

circumstances, to remove a director from offi ce.
9. Historical comparative TSR performance graphs
The graphs on this page represent the comparative TSR performance of the Company from 1 January 2002 
to 31 December 2006. In drawing these graphs it has been assumed that all dividends paid have been 
reinvested.
The fi rst graph shows the Company's performance against the performance of the FTSE 100 Index, chosen 
as being a broad equity market index comprising companies of a comparable size and complexity to Anglo 
American. This graph has been produced in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the 
Companies Act 1985.
The second graph shows the Company's performance against the weighted comparator group used to 
measure company performance for the purposes of the vesting of LTIP interests conditionally awarded in 
2004. This graph gives an indication of how Anglo American is performing against the targets in place for 
LTIP interests already granted, although the specifi cs of the comparator companies for each year's interests 
may vary to refl ect changes such as mergers and acquisitions amongst the Company's competitors or 
changes to the Company's business mix.
In accordance with the LTIP rules, TSR is calculated in US dollars, and the TSR level shown at 31 December

 The LTIP awards made in 2006 are conditional on two performance conditions as outlined on pages 68 to 70: the fi rst based on the Company's TSR relative to a 
weighted group of international natural resource companies and to the constituents of the FTSE 100, and the second based on an underlying operating measure 
which focuses on raising the Company's ROCE in the medium term. Further details on the structure of the LTIP, the required level of performance for the 2006 
award and how performance against targets is measured can be found on pages 68 to 70. The market price of the shares at the date of award was  20.72.
(2)
 The performance period applicable to each award is three years. The performance period relating to the 2003 LTIP awards (which were granted on 11 April 2003) 
ended on 31 December 2005. Vesting was subject to two performance conditions: the fi rst based on the Company's TSR relative to a weighted group of 
international natural resource companies and the second based on an underlying operating measure which focused on improvements in the Company's ROCE in 
the medium term. Part of each award was based on the TSR measure and part on the operating measure.

 In the case of the LTIP awards granted in 2003, the determinants for vesting were 50% on relative TSR and 50% on meeting specifi ed Group ROCE targets.
The ROCE targets are a function of targeted improvement in returns on existing capital employed at the start of the performance period and targeted returns in 
excess of the cost of capital on new capital investment over that period. The entry level target for any LTIP has been the actual return achieved on the capital 
employed, excluding capital work in progress, in the year immediately preceding the commencement of the performance period. In order to maintain the 
effectiveness of the plan in driving long term performance, the actual returns in the fi nal performance year are adjusted for movements in commodity prices, 
certain foreign exchange rate effects (e.g. translation windfalls), capital in progress (to refl ect the fact that mines under construction absorb large amounts of 
capital before producing a return), for relevant changes in the composition of the Group (e.g. signifi cant acquisitions and disposals) and other one off factors 
which would otherwise result in a misleading outcome.
 The threshold blended target (i.e. the target on existing and new capital) for the performance period for the 2003 LTIP was 18.8% and the upper blended target 
20.3%. The ROCE achieved was 21.1% and the outcome on this element of the LTIP was thus 100%. On the TSR measure, Anglo American achieved a TSR over 
the three year performance period of 129% which generated a nil vesting in terms of the 2003 Comparator Group. The overall vesting level for those directors 
with a 50% Group ROCE, 50% TSR split was therefore 50%.
(3)
 In addition to the LTIP award disclosed above, Ren  M dori was in June 2005 granted 50,600 forfeitable shares, of which 30,360 were released to him on
1 May 2006 and 20,240 will be released to him on 1 May 2007. These awards are conditional on his continued employment in the Group and are in partial 
compensation for long term incentives forgone at his previous employer. The market price of the shares at the date of this award was  13.34.

of their bonus (net of tax) to acquire shares in the Company. If these shares are held for three years, they

employment. No further awards have been made to directors under the DBP since 2003. The fi nal awards

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Independent Remuneration Report Review
This letter reports on the results of the review carried out by Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited of 
the processes followed by the Anglo American Remuneration Committee (the Committee) that support the 
Remuneration Report for the fi nancial year 2006. Mercer undertook the review at the request of the chairman 
of the Committee in order to provide shareholders with assurance that the remuneration processes followed 
are appropriate and that the Committee has complied with the policies set out in the Remuneration Report.
In order to reach our opinion, we reviewed the Committee's Terms of Reference and the minutes of its 
meetings held during the year as well as material presented to the Committee for its review. We also 
interviewed the Chairman and Secretary of the Committee. Our review was not intended to audit the 
compensation data set forth in the Remuneration Report or to evaluate the merits of Anglo American's 
remuneration programme.
Based on our review, Mercer is of the opinion that the processes followed by the Committee during 2006 
were fully consistent with its Terms of Reference and that the decisions taken by the Committee were in 
line with the principles set out in the Remuneration Report. It continues to be our view that the Committee 
takes a suitably robust and pro-active approach to its work.
We note the Committee has refi ned its modus operandi each year taking into account any comments we 
have made in our reviews.
In addition, the Committee has taken steps to improve its processes refl ecting areas for improvement 
highlighted in the Evaluation of the Committee undertaken with input from external advisors.
As a result we believe that the Anglo American Remuneration Committee is exemplary in its conduct, 
decision making and reporting.
The members of the Remuneration Committee are regularly updated on executive compensation and 
corporate governance matters.
Further detail regarding the Mercer review is included in a letter of this date addressed to the Committee 
Chairman which we understand will be made available on the Company's website.

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the fi nancial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare fi nancial statements for each fi nancial year. The directors 
are required by the IAS Regulation to prepare the Group fi nancial statements under International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. The Group fi nancial statements are also 
required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that IFRS fi nancial statements present fairly for each fi nancial 
year the Company's fi nancial position, fi nancial performance and cash fl ows. This requires the faithful 
representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the defi nitions 
and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting 
Standards Board's  Framework for the preparation and presentation of fi nancial statements'. In virtually all 
circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRS. However, 
directors are also required to:
 
 properly select and apply accounting policies;
 
 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable information; and 
 
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specifi c requirements in IFRS are insuffi cient 
to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
entity's fi nancial position and fi nancial performance.
The directors have elected to prepare the parent company fi nancial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
law). The parent company fi nancial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Company. In preparing these fi nancial statements, the directors are required to:
 
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 
 state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the fi nancial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the fi nancial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the parent company 
fi nancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
