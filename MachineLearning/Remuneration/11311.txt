REMUNERATION REPORT
ROLE OF THE REMUNERATION COMMIT TEE AND TERMS OF REFERENCE
The Remuneration Committee is a committee of the Board of directors and is responsible for the following:
   Making recommendations to the Board on the general policy on executive remuneration, benefits, conditions of service and staff retention.
   Determining the specific remuneration packages of executive directors and senior management of the Company including, but not limited to, basic 
salary, performance-based short- and long-term incentives, pensions and other benefits.
   The design and operation of the Company's share incentive schemes.
The full terms of reference of the committee are included on the Company's website.
MEMBERSHIP OF THE REMUNERATION COMMIT TEE DURING 2008
   Tom Wixley (chairman)
   Fred Phaswana
   Richard Dunne
   Russell King
All members of the committee are non-executive directors, of whom two are independent, including the chairman. The committee met five times during 
2008. The chief executive officer attends the committee meetings by invitation and assists the committee in its deliberations, except when issues relating 
to his own compensation are discussed. No director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration. In 2008, the committee was advised by the 
Group's finance and human resources functions, the holding company's human resource department, as well as PricewaterhouseCoopers, who assisted 
with the implementation and verification of calculations pertinent to the executive incentive schemes.
The Company's auditors, Deloitte & Touche, have not provided advice to the committee. However, in their capacity as Group auditors, they undertake 
agreed-upon procedures on the remuneration of directors.
REMUNERATION POLICY AND EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION
Principles of executive remuneration
Anglo Platinum's remuneration policy aims to attract and retain high-calibre executives and to motivate them to develop and implement the Company's 
business strategy in order to optimise long-term shareholder value creation. The policy conforms to best practice standards and is based on the following 
principles:
   Total rewards are set at levels that are competitive within the relevant market.
   Incentive-based rewards are earned through the achievement of demanding performance conditions consistent with shareholder interests over the 
short, medium and long term.
   Incentive plans, performance measures and targets are structured to operate effectively throughout the business cycle.
   The design of long-term incentives is prudent and does not expose shareholders to unreasonable financial risk. 153 ANGLO PLATINUM LIMITED 2 0 0 8
Elements of executive remuneration
   Base salary
   Benefits
   Annual bonus
   Long-term incentives
The committee seeks to ensure an appropriate balance between the fixed and performance-related elements of executive remuneration, and between 
those aspects of the package linked to short-term financial performance and those linked to longer-term shareholder value creation. A further 
consideration has been the need to retain critical skills in the Group. The committee considers each element of remuneration relative to the market and 
takes into account the performance of the Company and the individual executive in determining both quantum and design.
The policy relating to each component of remuneration is summarised below:
Base salary
The base salary of the executives is subject to annual review. It is set to be competitive at the median level, with reference to market practice in companies 
comparable in terms of size, market sector, business complexity and international scope. Company performance, individual performance and changes in 
responsibilities are also taken into consideration when determining annual base salaries.
Benefits
Benefits for executives include membership of a retirement fund and medical aid, to which contributions are made by the executives and the Company.
Annual bonus
All executives are eligible to participate in an annual bonus plan, with payment levels based on corporate and individual performance. Bonus potentials 
are set on an individual basis each year. The bonus plan is non-contractual and not pensionable. The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to 
make adjustments to bonuses earned at the end of the year on an exceptional basis, taking into account both Company performance and the overall and 
specific contribution of individual executives to meeting the Company's objectives.
The performance measures for the annual bonus plan include corporate performance targets as well as specific individual objectives. The corporate 
element in 2008 was based upon stringent production, cost and profitability targets. A reduction is made in cases where safety targets have not been 
achieved. 
The committee reviews measures annually to ensure that these, and the targets set, are appropriate given the economic context and the performance 
expectations for the Company. It is the committee's policy to base 75% of each annual bonus award on the corporate measures and the remaining 25% 
on the personal key performance indicators.
Long-term incentives
Since 2004, the current set of share incentive schemes, essential details of which are summarised below, has been in operation. The vesting of awards 
under the Executive Share Appreciation Scheme and Long-term Incentive Plan is subject to a number of performance conditions, which are designed to 
align the interests of senior executives with those of the Company's shareholders. The shareholding requirements for executives outlined below further 
strengthen the alignment. These schemes apply to senior executives. The Kotula Trust was registered during the course of the year and provides for the 
allocation of shares to employees who were not previously eligible to participate in the long-term incentive schemes. A new share scheme will be  A N N U A L F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S for the year ended 31 December

REMUNERATION REPORT
presented for approval by shareholders at the Company's annual general meeting to be held on 30 March 2009. It is proposed that the Bonus Share Plan 
(BSP) will largely replace the current Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP),  Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) and Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) share 
schemes. Senior executives will continue to receive allocations on the LTIP scheme and will also participate in the BSP with effect from April 2009. 
However, all previous allocations on the ESOS and LTIP will continue to vest over a three-year period and may be exercised in the normal course from date 
of vesting until a period of 10 years has elapsed or prior to termination of employment, whereupon they lapse.
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS)
The Remuneration Committee makes allocations of share options to executives on an annual basis. On 1 March 2008, the Remuneration Committee 
made an allocation of share options in terms of this scheme to all senior executives. The option is conditional on performance and is subject to a three-
year vesting period. The option price is set at the market price on the date immediately prior to allocation. Shares equal to the value of the growth of the 
option from the allocation date to the exercise date will be transferred to the participants upon exercising, provided that the performance condition has 
been met. The performance condition is an increase in headline earnings per share measured in US dollars of at least 6% over the three-year period. 
Options are normally exercisable, subject to satisfaction of the performance condition, between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Annual conditional allocations of LTIP shares are made to senior executives. The shares vest over a three-year period subject to the achievement of two 
stringent performance measures over this period: total shareholder return measured against a group of comparable companies, and return on capital 
employed. These performance conditions have been selected on the basis that they clearly foster the creation of shareholder value. The LTIP closely aligns 
the interests of shareholders and executives by rewarding superior shareholder and financial performance, and by encouraging executives to build up a 
shareholding in Anglo Platinum.
Deferred Bonus Plan
Under the DBP , senior executives are required to defer between 50% and 100% of their bonus on a year-by-year basis (net of tax) to acquire shares in Anglo 
Platinum. If these shares are held for three years, they are matched by the Company on a one-for-one basis (or in such specified ratio as determined by 
the Remuneration Committee), conditional upon the executive's continued employment. Use of this share match will allow Anglo Platinum to maintain 
competitiveness in annual bonus plan levels and encourage executives to invest in the shares of the Company, thus increasing the proportion of executive 
rewards linked to both short-term performance and longer-term total shareholder returns. The deferred bonus and share match will also act as a retention 
tool, and ensure that senior executives share a significant level of personal risk with the Company's shareholders.
Executive shareholding targets
Within five years of their appointment, members of the Executive are expected to accumulate a holding of shares and conditional awards in the Company 
with a value of 150% of annual base salary for the CEO and 100% of annual base salary in the case of other executives. In accumulating holdings, 
executives are not required to use their own funds to purchase shares in the market as it is anticipated thatthe retention of all or a portion of the share 
incentive awards which they receive will satisfy this goal. In measuring the extent to which the guidelines have been satisfied, holdings are valued at 
closing prices at the end of each financial year and base salary is taken at the amount earned in respect of the year just ended.
The current executive shareholding/awards as at 31 December 2008 for each of the seven share schemes indicated that the shareholding in Anglo 
Platinum was more than adequate to fulfil the requirements of the policy. 155 ANGLO PLATINUM LIMITED 2 0 0 8
Former share option plans
Certain executives still hold share options granted under the previous Anglo Platinum share option scheme. The options were allocated at the middle 
market price ruling on the trading day prior to the date of allocation, vest after stipulated periods and are exercisable up to a maximum of 10 years from 
the date of allocation. No allocations of these options to senior executives or executive directors were made after 2004.
Non-conditional LTIPS
With effect from 1 March 2008 managers at more junior levels, instead of receiving LTIPS, received non-conditional share awards which have no 
performance conditions. The reason for amending the performance conditions attached to these allocations is that managers at these levels are not 
directly in a position to personally contribute to the attainment of all of the Company's performance criteria. To qualify for vesting  of non-conditional LTIP 
shares, the only requirements are remaining in the employ of the Group company for three years from date of allocation as well as satisfactorry personal 
performance assessment ratings. The rules of the scheme provide for performance criteria which do not have to be company related and therefore the 
Remuneration Committee was afforded discretion to replace the Company performance conditions with personal performance conditions within the 
scope confines and intention of the Scheme Rules.
Kotula Trust Employee Share Ownership Plan
Anglo Platinum decided to implement the Employee Share Participation Scheme, the Anglo Platinum Kotula ESOP (the Scheme) to incentivise its 
employees, and recognised that the Scheme will contribute to the alignment of shareholders' and employees' interests in respect of the value growth of 
the Company. Anglo Platinum is fully supportive of BEE as a strategic transformation objective and recognised the importance of the participation of its 
employees in its transformation initiatives. Anglo Platinum reached consensus with its recognised unions on the key terms and structure of the Scheme 
and the Scheme was approved at a combined general meeting of shareholders on 31 March 2008. The Scheme has empowered those Anglo Platinum 
employees who were not participating in any other Anglo Platinum share scheme to acquire approximately 1% of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company, subject to the provisions of the Trust.  The Scheme has a seven year term and to faciliate the Scheme, Anglo Platinum established the Kotula 
Trust. The Trust subscribed for 1,008,519 ordinary Shares and 1,512,780 A  ordinary shares to the Kotula Trust on 16 May 2008. The A  ordinary shares were 
created specifically to facilitate the implementation of the Scheme.  The Scheme is unitised. The Trust will allocate 10,000,000 Kotula shares to participants 
annually, based on an employee's employment status on 31 March every year. On each vesting date, the beneficiaries will become entitled to receive their 
distribution shares and will correspondingly realise that portion of their Kotula shares that corresponds to the distribution shares distributed by the Trust. 
Vesting will occur on the fifth, sixth and seventh anniversaries of the subscription date.   The Trust will pay dividends (after making provision for Trust 
expenses and liabilities) to the beneficiaries in proportion to the number of Kotula shares accumulated by each benficiary, in November of each year.
Bonus Share Plan (BSP)
It was considered that the proposed substitution of the BSP for the previous incentive schemes will provide better alignment between the interests of 
executives and shareholders and will also facilitate the transfer of skilled employees within the greater Anglo American Group. In terms of the new plan 
annual cash bonuses will continue to be awarded based on individual and Company performance. In addition a forfeitable award of Anglo Platinum 
shares based on the amount of cash bonus will be made. The award will vest after three years, provided that the manager is still in the Group's employ.
Cash bonus award to members of staff aged 58 to 60
The Company's long-term incentive share scheme rules do not permit allocations to individuals within two years of retirement. However, in order to 
continue to recognise individual performance, value-add and meaningful contributions to the Company's performance by managers from age 58, a cash 
bonus award has been implemented on 1 March 2008. The award is based on the estimated fair value of the annual award for executives at a similar level 
who are not within two years of retirement. Participants are required to remain in the employ of the Company until the normal retirement age of 60. A N N U A L F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S for the year ended 31 December

Other matters affecting remuneration of directors
External appointments
Executive directors are not permitted to hold external directorships or offices without the approval of the Board. If approval is granted, directors may 
retain the fees payable from one such appointment.
Non- executive directors
The Board, in reviewing non-executive directors'  fees, makes recommendations to shareholders in the light of fees payable to non-executive directors of 
comparable companies and the importance attached to the retention and attraction of high-calibre individuals as non-executive directors. Levels of fees are 
also set by reference to the responsibilities assumed by the non-executive directors in chairing the Board and in chairing or participating in its committees.
Directors' fees
For 2008, the chairman received a sum of R800,000 per annum (2007: R750,000). Each of the non-executive directors received directors' fees at the rate of 
R135,000 per annum (2007: R130,000). The deputy chairman received a fee of R230,000 per annum (2007: R215,000). Non-executive directors (other than 
the chairman) who serve on the Anglo Platinum Group committees each received fees per annum as follows: Audit Committee R75,000 (2007: R70,000); 
Corporate Governance Committee R55,000 (2007: R50,000); Nomination Committee R55,000 (2007: R50,000); Remuneration Committee R60,000 (2007: 
R55,000); Safety and Sustainable Development Committee R55,000 (2007: R50,000), and the Transformation Committee R55,000. The chairmen who serve

Increase in directors' fees
At the annual general meeting on 30 March 2009, members will be asked to pass ordinary resolutions approving the following (as recommended by the 
Board):
   That the annual fees payable to non-executive directors of the Company be increased from R135,000 per annum to R145,000 per annum.
   That the annual fee payable to the deputy chairman of the Board be increased from R230,000 per annum to R250,000 per annum.
   That the annual fee payable to the chairman of the Board be increased from R800,000 per annum to R1,000,000 per annum.
   That the fees payable to non-executive directors for serving on the committees of the Board be increased as follows:
 - Audit Committee: member's fee to increase from R75,000 per annum to R80,000 per annum; chairman's fee to increase from R110,000 per annum 
to R115,000 per annum.
 - Corporate Governance Committee: member's fee to increase from R55,000 per annum to R60,000 per annum; chairman's fee to increase from 
R90,000 per annum to R95,000 per annum.
 - Nomination Committee: member's fee to increase from R55,000 per annum to R60,000 per annum; chairman's fee to increase from R90,000 per 
annum to R95,000 per annum.
 - Remuneration Committee: member's fee to increase from R60,000 per annum to R65,000 per annum; chairman's fee to increase from R100,000 per 
annum to R105,000 per annum.
 - Safety & Sustainable Development Committee member's fee to increase from R55,000 per annum to R60,000 per annum; chairman's fee to increase 
from R90,000 per annum to R95,000 per annum.
 - The Transformation Committee member's fee to increase from R55,000 per annum to R60,000 per annum; chairman's fee to increase from R90,000 
per annum to R95,000 per annum.
The increase in directors' fees is proposed for the purposes of remaining market competitive and attracting and retaining non-executive directors of high 
calibre and with the skills required to meaningfully contribute to the operation of the Board and its committees.
Non-executive directors do not participate in the Company's annual bonus plan, or any of its share incentieve schemes.
Directors' and executive management service contracts
It is the Company's policy that the period of notice required for executive directors does not exceed 12 months. In order to reflect their spread of 
responsibilities properly, all the executive directors have contracts with Anglo Platinum Limited.
None of the non-executive directors has a contract of employment with the Company. Their appointments are made in terms of the Company's  
articles of association and are confirmed initially at the first annual general meeting of shareholders following their appointment, and thereafter at three-
year intervals.
