1.1  Role of the Remuneration Committee 
and Terms of Reference
The Remuneration Committee (the 
Committee) is responsible for considering  
and making recommendations to the  
Board on:
   The Company's general policy on executive 
and senior management remuneration
   The specific remuneration packages for 
executive directors of the Company, 
including basic salary, performance-based 
short-term and long-term incentives, 
pensions and other benefits 
  The remuneration of the chairman
   The design and operation of the Company's 
share incentive schemes
The full Terms of Reference of the Committee 
can be found on the Anglo American website 
(www.angloamerican.com) and copies are 
available on request.
The Committee met three times during 2010 
and dealt with ad hoc items between formal 
meetings by  round robin' resolutions.
1.2  Membership of the Committee
The Committee comprised the following 
non-executive directors during the year ended 
31 December 2010:
  Sir Philip Hampton (chairman with effect 
from 22 April 2010)
  Sir Rob Margetts (resigned 22 April 2010)
  David Challen
  Sir CK Chow 
  Jack Thompson (appointed with effect from 
16 February 2010)
  Peter Woicke 
The Company's chief executive attends the 
Committee meetings by invitation and assists 
the Committee in its deliberations, except 
when issues relating to her own compensation 
are discussed. No directors are involved in 
deciding their own remuneration. In 2010, the 
Committee was advised by the Company's 
Human Resources and Finance functions  
and, specifically, by Mervyn Walker and Chris 
Corrin. It also took external advice as shown  
in Figure 1. Certain overseas operations within 
the Group are also provided with audit related 
services from Deloitte's and PwC's worldwide 
member firms and non-audit related services 
from Mercer's worldwide member firms.

GOVERNANCE: Directors' remuneration report 2.  Remune Ration policy  
on executive Di Recto R 
Remune Ration The Company's remuneration policy is 
formulated to attract and retain high-calibre 
executives and to motivate them to develop 
and implement the Company's business 
strategy in order to optimise long-term 
shareholder value creation. The Committee 
intends that this policy will continue to apply 
for 201 1 and subsequent years, subject to 
ongoing review as appropriate. The policy is 
framed around the following key principles: 
  Total rewards will be set at levels that are 
sufficiently competitive to enable the 
recruitment and retention of high-calibre 
executives
  Incentive-based rewards will be earned 
through the achievement of demanding 
performance conditions consistent with 
shareholder interests
  Incentive plans, performance measures and 
targets will be structured to operate soundly 
throughout the business cycle
  The design of long-term incentives will be 
prudent and will not expose shareholders to 
unreasonable financial risk
  In considering the market positioning of 
reward elements, account will be taken of 
the performance of the Company and of the 
individual executive director
  Reward practice will conform to best 
practice standards as far as reasonably 
practicable
Representatives of the Company's principal 
investors are consulted on material changes to 
remuneration policy.
3.  e lements of executive 
Di Recto R Remune Ration 3.1 Remuneration mix
Each executive director's total remuneration 
consists of salary, annual bonus, long-term 
incentives and benefits. An appropriate 
balance is maintained between fixed and 
performance-related remuneration and 
between elements linked to short-term 
financial performance and those linked to 
longer-term shareholder value creation.
Assuming on-target performance, the 
Committee's policy is that at least 50%  
(60% for Cynthia Carroll) of each executive 
director's remuneration is performance-
related. In 2010, 72% of the chief executive's 
and 71% of the finance director's 
remuneration on an expected-value basis  
was performance-related as shown in  
Figure 2 on page 100.
The Bonus Share Plan (BSP) and the Long 
Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) are designed to 
align the longer-term interests of shareholders 
and executives and to underpin the Company's 
performance culture. The Committee 
monitors the relevance and appropriateness 
of the performance measures and targets 
applicable to both plans. Further details of  
the BSP and the LTIP are set out on pages 
100 to 103.
Incentive levels are set taking account of  
the median expected value of long-term 
incentives relative to other companies of  
a similar size. 
Shareholder approval for the current LTIP 
expires in May 201 1 and a new LTIP will be put 
to shareholders at the AGM in April 201 1. The 
Committee therefore decided in the second 
half of 2010 that this was a sensible point at 
which to review the current short- and long- 
term incentive levels of executives to ensure 
that they remain market competitive. PwC 
were retained to provide external advice in  
this respect. 
The review found that the incentive 
opportunity for executives had fallen to levels 
that were uncompetitive when measured 
against FTSE 30 market practice. Whilst 
sensitive to shareholder concerns about  
the use of benchmarking in setting 
remuneration levels, the Committee feel it 
necessary to ensure that incentive levels 
remain appropriate to attract, retain and 
incentivise the senior management of a 
geographically diverse and operationally 
complex group. The recommendations  
from this review ( the Review') are set out in 
more detail under the relevant remuneration 
headings below. It is expected that the 
incentive opportunities proposed will 
remain in effect for the foreseeable future.
3.2 Basic salary
The basic salary of the executive directors 
is reviewed annually and is targeted at the 
market median of companies of comparable 
size, market sector, business complexity  
and international scope. This is adjusted  
either way based on experience and other 
relevant factors. The market for executives  
of main-board calibre, in large international 
mining companies in particular, has continued 
to be very competitive in recent years and it  
is therefore deemed sensible to position  
basic salary for executive directors at no  
lower than the median point. Company 
performance, individual performance and 
changes in responsibilities are also taken  
into consideration in setting salary levels  
each year.

The Review found that basic salaries were 
fairly positioned against the FTSE 30 and  
that there was no need for any fundamental 
realignment of executive director salaries. 
Accordingly, basic salary increases for 
executive directors with effect from January 
201 1 were limited to an inflation adjustment  
in line with the general salary review for the 
broader employee population. 
3.3  Bonus Share Plan (BSP)
The BSP was first operated in 2004 and all 
executive directors are normally eligible to 
participate in it.
The BSP requires executive directors to invest 
a significant proportion of their remuneration 
in shares, thereby more closely aligning their 
interests with those of shareholders, and 
encourages management at all levels to build 
up a meaningful personal stake in the 
Company. Awards under the BSP are not 
pensionable, are made annually and consist  
of three elements:
  A performance-related cash element
  Bonus Shares as a conditional award, 
normally to a value equal to the cash 
element
  An additional performance-related element 
in the form of Enhancement Shares
The award and matching levels are 
summarised in Figure 3. The BSP operates  
as follows: 
  The value of the bonus is calculated by 
reference to achievement against annual 
performance targets which include 
measures of corporate (and, where 
applicable, business unit) performance as 
well as the achievement of specific individual 
objectives. For executive directors, the 
corporate element is based on stretching 
earnings per share (EPS) targets which are 
calculated using underlying earnings 
(reconciled in note 13 of the financial 
statements). The key individual objectives 
are designed to support the Company's 
strategic priorities and in 2010 included cost 
and asset optimisation, project execution, 
portfolio restructuring, strategic initiatives, 
organisational structure and capabilities, 
CSR initiatives and safety improvements
  The Committee reviews these measures 
annually to ensure they remain appropriate 
and sufficiently stretching in the context of 
the broader macro-economic outlook and 
more specific performance expectations for 
the Company and its operating businesses
  In 2010, 50% of each annual bonus was 
based on the corporate financial measure 
and the remaining 50% on key personal 
performance measures. This split is 
designed to reflect the importance of the 
ongoing projects and strategic repositioning 
of the Group as well as the volatile nature of 
commodity prices with the implications of 
this on setting earnings targets. Bonus 
parameters are set on an individual basis 
and the level of bonus payable is reduced if 
certain overall safety improvement targets 
are not met
  In 2010 the maximum cash element was 
75% of basic salary in the case of both 
Cynthia Carroll and Ren  M dori. The Review 
found that the total incentive opportunity for 
executive directors had fallen below the 
median opportunity offered within FTSE 30 
companies. Consequently, for 2011 the 
Committee is proposing to increase the 
maximum cash element from 75% to 87.5% 
of basic salary for executive directors
 Normally, half of any bonus earned is 
payable in cash and the other half is 
deferred into shares. The maximum bonus 
is payable only for meeting targets which,  
in the opinion of the Committee, represent 
an exceptional performance for the Group 
in the light of prevailing market conditions. 
The part of the bonus that is deferred is 
delivered in the form of a conditional award 
of Bonus Shares. These Bonus Shares  
vest only if the participant remains in 
employment with the Group until the end of 
a three-year holding period (or is regarded 
by the Committee as a  good leaver'). As 
reported in 2009, the Committee concluded 
that the proportion of the bonus deferred 
into shares should be increased from 50% 
to 75% for a second year running to 
increase the alignment with shareholders' 
interests; the Committee will allow 
executive directors to elect to continue 
deferral of bonus up to these percentages 
from 201 1 onwards
  From 201 1 onwards, the Committee 
intends to apply a clawback of deferred 
Bonus Shares in the event that, during the 
relevant deferral period, the Committee 
becomes aware of a material error in the 
Company's results for the relevant bonus 
performance period
  Executive directors also receive a 
conditional award of Enhancement Shares 
at the same time as the award of Bonus 
Shares. The maximum potential, at face 
value, of the Enhancement Shares is 75% of 
the face value of the Bonus Shares. Awards 
of Enhancement Shares made in 2010 will 
vest after three years only to the extent  
that a challenging performance condition 
(based on earnings per share growth 
against growth in the UK Retail Price Index 
(RPI) - Real EPS growth) is met as shown in 
Figure 4. Real EPS growth is viewed as the 
most appropriate performance measure  
for this element of the BSP because it is  
a fundamental financial performance 
indicator, both internally and externally, and 
links directly to the Company's long-term 
objective of improving earnings. There is  
no retesting of this performance condition. 
Enhancement Shares will be subject to  
the same clawback provisions mentioned 
previously
The BSP targets have been approved by the 
Committee after reviewing performance over 
a number of years and have been set at a level 
which provides stretching performance levels 
for management. 
The level of performance achieved and the 
proportion of awards vesting in respect of 
each performance period will be published  
in the subsequent remuneration report.
3.4  Share options and all-employee 
share schemes
No share options were granted in 2010 to 
executive directors under the Company's 
Discretionary Option Plan (DOP) and there is 
no intention to make future grants under the 
unapproved part of the DOP to executive 
directors. However, the DOP is retained for 
use in special circumstances relating to the 
recruitment or retention of key executives. 
UK-based executive directors are eligible to 
participate in the Company's Save As You 
Earn scheme (SAYE) and Share Incentive 
Plan (SIP). Performance conditions do not 
apply to these schemes because they are 
offered to all UK-based employees.

3.5  Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
At the AGM in April 201 1, shareholders will be 
asked to approve a new LTIP to replace the 
existing LTIP , which will expire in mid-201 1. The 
new LTIP will be broadly similar to the existing 
LTIP , except as described in the summary table, 
Figure 5, and the sections below.
Award levels
Conditional LTIP awards are granted annually 
to executive directors. The maximum award 
level under the current LTIP is 200% of basic 
salary. The Review's findings showed that this 
award level is well behind market practice for 
the FTSE 30 and, for the new LTIP , the 
Committee is proposing that the normal 
maximum award level be increased for 201 1 to 
350% and 300% of basic salary respectively 
for the chief executive and finance director, 
with an overall scheme maximum of 350% of 
basic salary. The Committee is satisfied that 
the performance conditions that need to be 
met for these awards to vest in full are 
sufficiently stretching in the context of the 
award levels. These awards are discretionary 
and are considered on a case-by-case basis.
Performance measures
As in previous years, vesting of the LTIP 
awards made during 2010 is subject to the 
achievement, over a fixed three-year period,  
of stretching Group performance targets.
Half of each award is subject to a Group Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) measure, while the 
other half is subject to a Group operational 
measure. As set out in last year's report, the 
Committee examined the possible use of an 
Asset Optimisation Supply Chain (AOSC) 
efficiency measure in place of the return on 
capital employed metric. Following this review 
and dialogue with the Company's major 
investors, an AOSC measure was put in place 
in respect of the 2010 LTIP award for the first 
time. The performance measures for the 201 1 
LTIP award will be the same as those used in 
2010. These measures are described in 
greater detail on the following page.

101 Anglo American plc     Annual Report 2010
Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Other information These performance measures were selected 
on the basis that they foster the creation of 
shareholder value and their appropriateness is 
kept under review by the Committee. Taken as 
a whole, vesting depends on meeting a very 
challenging set of performance hurdles.
At the end of each performance period, the 
levels of TSR and AOSC performance 
achieved and the level of award earned will be 
published in the subsequent remuneration 
report. There is no retesting of the 
performance conditions.
The LTIP is intended closely to align the 
interests of shareholders and executive 
directors by rewarding superior shareholder 
returns and financial performance and by 
encouraging executives to build up a 
shareholding in the Company.
From 201 1 onwards, the Committee intends  
to apply a clawback of conditional LTIP  
awards in the event that, during the relevant 
performance period, the Committee becomes 
aware of a material error in the Company's 
results for the relevant performance period.
Total shareholder return (TSR)
The Committee considers comparative  
TSR to be a suitable long-term performance 
measure for the Company's LTIP awards. 
Executives would benefit under this measure 
only if shareholders have enjoyed returns on 
their investment which are superior to those 
that could have been obtained in other 
comparable companies.
50% of the proportion of each award that is 
based on TSR is measured against the Sector 
Index and 50% is measured against the 
constituents of the FTSE 100. Maximum 
vesting of the TSR element of an award will be 
possible only if Anglo American outperforms 
by a substantial margin both the sector 
benchmark (as described in the following 
section) and the largest UK companies across 
all sectors.
Sector Index comparison
One half of the TSR element of an LTIP award 
vests according to the Company's TSR over  
the performance period, relative to a weighted 
basket of international mining companies  
(the Sector Index). The Committee may amend 
the list of comparator companies in the Sector 
Index, and relative weightings, if circumstances 
make this necessary (for example, as a result  
of takeovers or mergers of comparator 
companies or significant changes in the 
composition of the Group). In calculating TSR  
it is assumed that all dividends are reinvested.
For awards made in 2010, the companies 
constituting the Sector Index were as shown in 
Figure 6 on page 101. Should the Tarmac Group 
be sold or demerged during the performance 
period relating to this award, the percentage 
attributable to Industrial Minerals will fall to zero.
Target performance for the Sector Index is 
assessed by calculating the median TSR 
performance within each sub-sector category, 
and then weighting these medians by the 
category weightings shown in Figure 6 on 
page 101. For 2010 and 201 1 that part of any 
award that is contingent upon the Sector Index 
element of the TSR performance will vest as 
shown in Figure 7 on page 101. The outcome 
of the Review is that, for proposed awards in 
201 1 and onwards, threshold vesting would  
be reduced and maximum vesting would be 
capped at 50% (previously 75%). Shares will 
vest on a straight-line basis for performance 
between the levels shown in Figure 7 on  
page 101. 
FTSE 100 comparison
The vesting of the other half of the TSR 
element of an LTIP award will depend on  
the Company's TSR performance over the 
performance period compared with the 
constituents of the FTSE 100 Index, as 
outlined in Figure 8 for awards in 2010 and 
Figure 9 for proposed awards for 201 1 
onwards. Again, threshold vesting would be 
reduced and maximum vesting would be 
capped at 50% (previously 75%) which would 
now occur at the 80th percentile (previously 
90th). Shares will vest on a straight-line basis 
for performance between the levels shown in 
Figures 8 and 9.
The targets were calibrated such that for  
the TSR elements of the award there is 
approximately a 15% chance of achieving full 
vesting and a 25% chance of three-quarters 
vesting. These probabilities were assessed by 
PwC using the same Monte Carlo model used 
for calculating fair values of the LTIP under 
IFRS 2 (Share-based Payments). The 
estimated average fair value of an award under 
the TSR element using these proposed 
targets is 60% of the face value (this is lower 
than for the 2010 LTIP targets which had a 
maximum vesting percentage of 150% and  
a fair value of 50% of the maximum number  
of shares that could vest).
Graphs showing the Company's TSR 
performance against the weighted average  
of the Sector Index and against the FTSE 100 
for the five years from 1 January 2006 to 
31 December 2010 can be found in Figure 14 
on page 104.
Asset Optimisation and Supply Chain
AOSC is the second performance measure  
for LTIP awards. The Company's AOSC 
programmes strive to unlock value from the 
Company's assets in a sustainable way through 
structured Group-wide programmes aimed  
at reducing costs, increasing volumes and 
improving overall operational efficiencies.  
In 2010, the Group's AOSC programmes 
delivered $2.5 billion of benefits from the core 
businesses ($3.0 billion from the total Group),

and capital expenditure savings realised in  
the year, over and above the performance 
expected had the programmes not been 
initiated. These benefits are valued employing 
2010 commodity prices and exchange rates.
Tying the AOSC measure directly to a 
meaningful portion of executives' incentive pay 
reflects the importance of the AOSC initiative in 
delivering increased value to shareholders, as 
evidenced by the very significant and stretching 
level of the targets. The adjudication of targets 
will be reviewed by internal audit and reported 
at the end of each performance period. 
The proportion of shares vesting based on 
AOSC will vary according to the aggregate 
AOSC value delivered over the performance 
period. Unless a certain minimum value  
target is met, no shares will vest under this 
performance measure. The maximum  
AOSC target is based on a stretching level  
of value delivered.
The targets for the AOSC element of the 2010 
conditional award are shown in Figure 10.
The AOSC element of the award vests as 
shown in Figure 1 1.
Shares will vest on a straight-line basis for 
performance between the Minimum AOSC 
Target and the Maximum AOSC Target.
3.6  Vesting of share incentives in the 
event of change of control or 
termination of employment
In the event of a change of control of the 
Company, the following provisions apply 
under the Company's incentive plans: 
  The number of shares that vest under the 
LTIP will be calculated by reference to the 
extent to which the applicable performance 
conditions have been met at the time of the 
change of control
  The Bonus Shares awarded under the BSP 
will be released and the Enhancement 
Shares awarded under the BSP will only 
vest to the extent that the performance 
condition has been met at the time of the 
change of control
  Share options granted under the DOP or 
under the Company's legacy Executive 
Share Option Scheme (ESOS) may be 
exercised irrespective of whether the 
applicable performance conditions have 
been met
  SAYE options may be exercised (to the 
extent of savings at the date of exercise)
  Participants in the SIP may direct the SIP 
trustee as to how to deal with their shares
In the event that an executive director's 
employment is terminated, vesting of any 
outstanding share options under the DOP  
or under the ESOS is dependent upon the 
reasons for termination. Performance 
conditions fall away in the event of 
redundancy. However, if the director resigns 
voluntarily, then all such options lapse unless 
the Committee determines otherwise. 
In the case of LTIP awards, the Committee 
would normally exercise its discretion when  
an executive director's employment ceases as 
follows: if the director resigns voluntarily, then 
his/her interests lapse. If he/she retires with 
the consent of the Committee, is made 
redundant or is considered by the Committee 
to be a  good leaver', vesting on leaving is 
based on the normal performance criteria at 
the time of leaving and then pro rated for the 
proportion of the performance period for 
which the director served. 
In the case of the BSP , if an executive director 
ceases to be employed before the end of  
the year in respect of which the annual 
performance targets apply, then no award will 
be made unless the Committee determines 
otherwise (taking into account the proportion 
of the year for which the director was an 
employee of the Group and of performance to 
date against the annual performance targets 
at the date of cessation). If a director resigns 
voluntarily before the end of the three-year 
vesting period, the Bonus Shares lapse and 
awards of Enhancement Shares are forgone. 
If a director retires with the consent of the 
Committee, is made redundant or is considered 
by the Committee to be a  good leaver', Bonus 
Shares already awarded will be transferred as 
soon as practicable after the date of leaving. 
Enhancement Shares will vest only to the extent 
that the performance condition has been met 
and if vesting is accelerated to the time of leaving 
will be pro rated for the proportion of the 
performance period for which the director served.
3.7  Employee Share Ownership Trust 
and policy on provision of shares  
for incentive schemes
The Group has hitherto used an Employee 
Share Ownership Trust (the Trust) to acquire and 
hold shares for use in the operation of its share 
schemes. As at 31 December 2010, the Trust 
held 985 ordinary shares in the Company, 
registered in the name of Greenwood Nominees 
Limited. Shares held by the Trust are not voted  
at the Company's general meetings. It is the 
Company's current policy to meet the 
requirements of share incentive schemes by 
using a mix of Treasury Shares, shares from the 
Trust or by market purchases, as appropriate. 
The Company also has the necessary authorities 
to utilise newly issued shares if required.
3.8 Pensions
Details of individual pension arrangements  
are set out on page 107. The Review found 
that the current level of company pension 
contribution was in line with market practice 
and was not in need of change at present. 
Executive directors (and UK employees  
more generally) have the option of all or part 
of their employer-funded defined-contribution 
pension contributions being paid as an 
alternative to an unregistered retirement 
benefits scheme (an EFRBS). 
Since the inception of the new UK pensions 
regime applicable from 6 April 2006, the 
Committee has been prepared to consider 
requests from executive directors (as is the case 
for London-based employees more generally) 
that their contracts be altered for future service, 
so that future pension benefits are reduced or 
cease to accrue and that a pension allowance be 
paid having the same value as the defined-
contribution benefits forgone.
Similarly, the Committee is prepared to 
consider requests from executive directors  
(as is the case for London-based employees 
more generally) that their contracts be altered 
for future service, so that supplementary 
pension contributions are made into their 
defined-contribution pension arrangements, 
in return for equivalent reductions in their 
future basic salaries and/or other elements of 
their remuneration.
3.9 Other benefits
Executive directors are entitled to the 
provision of a car allowance, medical 
insurance, death and disability insurance, 
social club membership and limited personal 
taxation/financial advice, in addition to 
reimbursement of reasonable business 
expenses. The provision of these benefits is 
considered to be market-competitive.
4.  e xecutive sha Rehol Ding 
ta Rgets Within five years of their appointment, 
executive directors are expected to acquire 
and maintain a holding of shares with a value 
of two times basic salary in the case of the 
chief executive and one and a half times 
(previously one times) basic salary in the case 
of any other executive director.
The Committee takes into consideration 
achievement against these targets when 
making grants under the Company's various 
long-term incentive plans.
5. e xte Rnal appointments Executive directors are not permitted to hold 
external directorships or offices without the 
prior approval of the Board; if approved, they 
may each retain the fees payable from one 
such appointment. During the year ended 
31 December 2010, Cynthia Carroll and 
Ren  M dori each retained fees amounting  
to  90,000 and  66,000 respectively.

6.  p olicy on non-executive 
Di Recto R Remune Ration Non-executive director remuneration is 
approved by the Board as a whole on the 
recommendation of the chairman and 
executive directors.
The Company's policy on non-executive 
director remuneration is based on the 
following key principles: 
  Remuneration should be: 
 -  sufficient to attract and retain world-class 
non-executive talent
 -  consistent with recognised best practice 
standards for non-executive director 
remuneration
 -  in the form of cash fees, but with the 
flexibility to forgo all or part of such fees 
(after deduction of applicable income tax 
and social security contributions) to 
acquire shares in the Company should the 
non-executive director so wish
 -  set by reference to the responsibilities 
taken on by the non-executives in chairing 
the Board and its committees
  Non-executive directors may not participate 
in the Company's share incentive schemes 
or pension arrangements
It is the intention that this policy will continue to 
apply for 201 1 and subsequent years, subject 
to ongoing review as appropriate.
The Board reviews non-executive directors' 
fees periodically to ensure that they remain 
market-competitive. Additional fees are paid 
to the chairmen of Board Committees and to 
the senior independent director (SID). Should 
non-executive directors acquire executive 
board roles within subsidiaries of the 
Company, then they might also receive 
additional remuneration from the relevant 
subsidiaries on account of these increased 
responsibilities. Non-executive directors'  
fees were last increased following a review  
in December 2009 (and took effect in  
January 2010). Fees will next be reviewed  
in December 201 1.
7. c hai Rman's fees The chairman's fees are reviewed  
periodically (on a different cycle from the 
review of other non-executive directors' fees).  
A recommendation is then made to the Board 
(in the absence of the chairman) by the 
Committee and chief executive, who will take 
external advice on market comparators. 
As set out in last year's report, at the time of 
the chairman's appointment in August 2009, 
he received a restricted award of shares in  
the Company to a value of  500,000 which  
he undertook to match with his personal 
funds. The award will be released on the  
third anniversary of his appointment  
subject to his still being chairman.

104 Anglo American plc     Annual Report 2010
GOVERNANCE: Directors' remuneration report - continued The Committee concluded in December 2010 
that it would be appropriate to offer Sir John  
a further share award to a value of  250,000  
in the first quarter of 201 1; the award would  
be released in full at the third anniversary of 
the grant subject to his still being chairman 
and would again be matched by Sir John 
progressively over the three-year period.  
This further share award was contemplated by 
the terms agreed on Sir John's appointment. 
Consultation with shareholders has taken 
place on this basis and it is intended to make 
the award shortly after the announcement  
of results.
8. Di Recto Rs' se Rvice cont Racts Cynthia Carroll and Ren  M dori are 
employed by Anglo American Services  
(UK) Ltd (AAS).
It is the Company's policy that the period  
of notice for executive directors will not 
exceed 12 months and accordingly the 
employment contracts of the executive 
directors are terminable at 12 months' notice 
by either party. 
The contracts of executive directors do not 
provide for any enhanced payments in the 
event of a change of control of the Company, 
nor for liquidated damages.
All non-executive directors have letters of 
appointment with the Company for an initial 
period of three years from their date of each 
appointment, subject to reappointment at the 
AGM as shown in Figure 13.
9.  h isto Rical compa Rative ts R 
pe Rfo Rmance g Raphs The graphs shown in Figure 14 represent  
the comparative TSR performance of  
the Company from 1 January 2006 to 
31 December 2010. In drawing up these 
graphs it has been assumed that all dividends 
paid have been reinvested.
The first graph shows the Company's 
performance against the performance of the 
FTSE 100 Index, chosen as being a broad 
equity market index which includes 
companies of a comparable size and 
complexity to Anglo American. This graph has 
been produced in accordance with the Large 
and Medium Sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008.
The second graph shows the Company's 
performance against the weighted Sector 
Index comparator group used to measure 
company performance for the purposes of the 
vesting of LTIP interests conditionally awarded 
in 2008. This graph gives an indication of how 
the Company is performing against the targets 
in place for LTIP interests already granted, 
although the specifics of the comparator 
companies for each year's interests may vary 
to reflect changes such as mergers and 
acquisitions among the Company's 
competitors or changes to the Company's 
business mix. TSR is calculated in US dollars, 
and the TSR level shown as at 31 December 
each year is the average of the closing daily 
TSR levels for the five-day period up to and 
including that date.

The performance period applicable to each award is three years. Cynthia Carroll did not receive a BSP award in 2007 (in respect of the 2006 financial year) and consequently no shares vested in 2010.

In the case of the BSP awards granted in 2007, the determinant for the vesting of Enhancement Shares was real EPS growth, based on earnings per share growth against growth in the UK Retail Price Index 
(RPI) over the performance period. 44% of the Enhancement Shares would vest if EPS growth was RPI+9%, and 100% would vest if EPS growth was RPI+15%. As the EPS growth was below the threshold 
target over the period, nil vesting of the Enhancement Shares occurred.
(2) 
Where permitted by finance legislation, awards of Bonus Shares under the BSP are granted as forfeitable shares, which would be forfeited in the event that an executive director leaves service, other than as 
a  good leaver', before the shares are released. The number of Bonus Shares awarded in 2010 was reduced to meet income tax liabilities. The reduction in respect of Cynthia Carroll was 19,231 shares and in 
respect of Ren  M dori was 12,088 shares (at a value of  529,419 and  332,776 respectively).
(3) 
In accordance with her terms upon joining, Cynthia Carroll was granted 132,718 forfeitable shares, in compensation for long-term incentives forgone at her previous employer. The market price of the shares 
at the date of this award was  24.91. These shares are forfeitable in the event that she leaves service before they are released to her. As a result of the share consolidation following the demerger of Mondi, 
11,945 shares lapsed and the resultant forfeitable award was 120,773 forfeitable shares, of which 72,464 were released to her in February 2008, 24,155 were released to her in February 2009 and 24,154  
were released to her in February 2010, as follows:

The LTIP awards made in 2010 are conditional on two performance conditions as outlined on pages 101 to 103: the first is based on the Company's TSR relative to a weighted group of international mining 
companies and to the constituents of the FTSE 100; the second is based on the value delivered from AOSC initiatives during the medium term. Further details on the structure of the LTIP, the required level of 
performance for the 2010 award and how performance against targets is measured can be found on pages 101 to 103. The market price of the shares at the date of award was  25.69.
(2) 
The performance period applicable to each award is three years. The performance period relating to the LTIP awards in 2007 (which were granted on 23 March) ended on 31 December 2009. Vesting 
was subject to two performance conditions: the first based on the Company's TSR relative to a weighted group of international mining companies and the FTSE 100; the second based on an underlying 
operating measure which focused on improvements in the Company's ROCE in the medium term. Part of each award was based on the TSR measure and part on the operating measure. These awards are  
as follows:

Ren  M dori 30,403 23/03/2007 24.63 29.27 889,896 
 
In the case of the LTIP awards granted in 2007, the determinants for vesting were 50% on relative TSR and 50% on meeting specified Group ROCE targets. The ROCE targets are a function of targeted 
improvement in returns on existing capital employed at the start of the performance period and targeted returns in excess of the cost of capital on new capital investment over that period. The entry-level target 
for any LTIP has been the actual return achieved on the capital employed, excluding capital work in progress, in the year immediately preceding the commencement of the performance period. In order to 
maintain the effectiveness of the plan in driving long-term performance, the actual returns in the final performance year are adjusted for movements in commodity prices, certain foreign exchange rate effects 
(e.g. translation windfalls), capital in progress (to reflect the fact that mines under construction absorb large amounts of capital before producing a return), relevant changes in the composition of the Group  
(e.g. significant acquisitions and disposals) and other one-off factors which would otherwise result in a misleading outcome. 
 The threshold blended target (i.e. the target on existing and new capital) for the performance period for the 2006 LTIP was 37.46% and the upper blended target 39.46%. The ROCE achieved was 43.20% and 
the outcome on this element of the LTIP was thus 100%. On the TSR measure, Anglo American achieved a TSR over the three-year performance period of -25% which generated a nil% vesting in terms of the 
2006 Sector Index Comparator Group (against a median target of 23%) and a 44% vesting against the FTSE 100 (being between the 50th percentile and 90th percentile). The overall vesting level for those 
directors with a 50% Group ROCE, 25% Sectoral TSR and 25% FTSE 100 TSR split was therefore 61%.

was 120,773 forfeitable shares, of which 72,464 were released to her in February 2008, 24,155 were released to her in February 2009 and 24,154 were released to her in February 2010.

109 Anglo American plc     Annual Report 2010
Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Other information This letter contains the findings and 
conclusions from our review of the processes 
followed by Anglo American's Remuneration 
Committee (the Committee) during 2010.  
The review was undertaken at your request  
as Chairman of the Committee in order to 
provide shareholders with assurance that  
the processes followed by the Committee 
supported the policy stated in Anglo American's 
Remuneration Report.
It is our view that the processes followed by 
the Committee during 2010 fully supported 
the Company's remuneration policy. Please 
find below a description of the process that  
we followed in coming to our conclusion,  
along with our detailed observations and 
recommendations.
Review p Rocess In order to reach our view we undertook the 
following:
  A review of the Committee's terms of 
reference
  A review of the minutes of the Committee 
covering the period from January to 
December 2010
  A review of any briefing materials prepared 
for the Committee during the year
  An interview with Chris Corrin in his capacity 
as Secretary to the Committee 
  An interview with the Chairman of the 
Committee
f in Dings The Committee comprises entirely of 
independent non-executive directors. It  
met formally on three occasions in 2010. 
We reviewed the minutes of each meeting 
along with any supporting papers or 
documentation that was tabled. We found  
that the decisions taken by the Committee 
were in line with Anglo American's stated 
remuneration policy namely that levels of 
reward, whilst competitive, require demanding 
performance conditions to be met which are 
consistent with shareholder interests. We are 
satisfied that the Committee closely adheres 
to the stated policy of setting base pay levels  
at the median of comparable companies, that 
at least 50% of remuneration for the executive 
directors is performance related and that 
variable pay is consistent with business 
performance, market conditions and retention 
of talent.
We are satisfied that the Committee 
challenges the proposals put forward by 
executive management and adopts a rigorous 
and robust approach to decision making. 
We are also satisfied that the Committee 
seeks the advice of external consultants on 
technical issues where appropriate and gives 
careful consideration to the information and 
recommendations that it receives, before 
reaching an informed decision.
i n Depen Dent Remune Ration Repo Rt Review c onclusions On the basis of the document review  
referred to above and the interviews with  
the Chairman and Secretary of the 
Committee, we are comfortable that the 
Committee has discharged its duties in line 
with the Policy of Executive Remuneration 
stated in Anglo American's Annual Report.
We note that in line with the requirements  
of the Combined Code the composition of the 
Committee including the chairmanship has 
been changed.
Yours sincerely

GOVERNANCE: Independent remuneration report review p rin Cipal a Ctivities and 
Business review Anglo American plc is one of the world's 
largest mining companies, is headquartered  
in the UK and listed on the London  
and Johannesburg stock exchanges. 
Anglo American's portfolio of mining 
businesses spans precious metals and 
minerals - in which it is a global leader in  
both platinum and diamonds; base metals - 
copper and nickel; and bulk commodities - 
iron ore, metallurgical coal and thermal coal. 
Anglo American is committed to the highest 
standards of safety and responsibility across 
all its businesses and geographies and to 
making a sustainable difference in the 
development of the communities around its 
operations. The Company's mining operations 
and extensive pipeline of growth projects are 
located in southern Africa, South America, 
Australia, North America and Asia. 
More detailed information about the  
Group's businesses, activities and financial 
performance is incorporated in this report by 
reference and can be found in the Chairman's 
and Chief executive's statements on pages 
6 to 7 and 12 to 13 respectively and the 
Operating and financial review on pages  
14 to 85. The Corporate governance 
statement is on pages 86 to 97 and is 
incorporated in this Directors' report 
by reference.
g oing Con Cern The financial position of the Group, its cash 
flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
are set out in the Group financial performance 
review on pages 42 to 45. In addition, detail  
is given on the Group's policy on managing 
credit and liquidity risk in the Risk section on 
pages 46 to 53, with details of our policy on 
capital risk management being set out in note 
25 to the financial statements. The Group's net 
debt at 31 December 2010 (including related 
hedges) was $7.4 billion (2009: $1 1.3 billion), 
representing a gearing level of 16.3%  
(2009: 28.7%). Details of borrowings and 
facilities are set out in notes 24 and 25 and  
net debt is set out in note 31.
The directors have considered the Group's 
cash flow forecasts for the period to the end  
of March 2012. The Board is satisfied that the 
Group's forecasts and projections, taking 
account of reasonably possible changes in 
trading performance show that the Group  
will be able to operate within the level of its 
current facilities for the foreseeable future.  
For this reason the Group continues to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing its 
financial statements.
dire Ctors'
r eport The directors have pleasure in submitting  
the statutory financial statements of the  
Group for the year ended 31 December 2010.
d ividends An interim dividend of 25 US cents per 
ordinary share was paid on 16 September 
2010. The directors are recommending that  
a final dividend of 40 US cents per ordinary 
share, be paid on 28 April 201 1 to ordinary 
shareholders on the register on 1 April 201 1, 
subject to shareholder approval at the  
Annual General Meeting (AGM) to be held  
on 21 April 201 1. This would bring the total 
dividend in respect of 2010 to 65 US cents  
per ordinary share. In accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS), the final dividend will be accounted for 
in the financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 201 1.
Two shareholders have waived their rights
to receive dividends. In both cases, these
shareholders act as trustees/nominees 
holding shares for use solely in relation to  
the Group's employee share plans. These 
shareholders and the value of dividends 
waived during the year were:

p ayment of suppliers Anglo American plc is a holding company  
and, as such, has no material trade creditors.
Businesses across the Group are responsible 
for agreeing the terms under which 
transactions with their suppliers are conducted, 
reflecting local and industry norms and group 
purchasing arrangements which may have 
been made with a supplier. The Group values 
its suppliers and recognises the benefits to be 
derived from maintaining good relationships 
with them. Anglo American acknowledges the 
importance of paying invoices, especially those 
of small businesses, promptly.
v alue of land Land is mainly carried in the financial 
statements at cost. It is not practicable to 
estimate the market value of land and mineral 
rights, since these depend on product prices 
over the next 20 years or more, which will vary 
with market conditions.
p ost- Balan Ce sheet events Post-balance sheet events are set out in note 
38 to the financial statements on page 168.
a udit information The directors confirm that, so far as they are 
aware, there is no relevant audit information of 
which the auditors are unaware and that all 
directors have taken all reasonable steps to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the auditors 
are aware of that information.
e mployment and other poli Cies The Group's key operating businesses are 
empowered to manage, within the context of 
the different legislative and social demands  
of the diverse countries in which those 
businesses operate, subject to the standards 
embodied in Anglo American's Good 
Citizenship: Our Business Principles. In 2009, 
after an extensive review, the Business 
Principles were updated.
Within all the Group's businesses, the safe and 
effective performance of employees and the 
maintenance of positive employee relations 
are of fundamental importance. Managers are 
charged with ensuring that the following key 
principles are upheld:
  Adherence to national legal standards on 
employment and workplace rights at all 
times
  Adoption of fair labour practices
  Prohibition of child labour
  Prohibition of inhumane treatment of 
employees and any form of forced labour, 
physical punishment or other abuse
  Continual promotion of safe and healthy 
working practices
  Promotion of workplace equality and 
elimination of all forms of unfair 
discrimination
  Provision of opportunities for employees 
to enhance their work-related skills and 
capabilities
  Recognition of the right of our employees 
to freedom of association
  Adoption of fair and appropriate procedures 
for determining terms and conditions of 
employment
Further, the Group is committed to treating 
employees at all levels with respect and 
consideration, to investing in their 
development and to ensuring that their 
careers are not constrained by discrimination 
or arbitrary barriers.
1 12 Anglo American plc     Annual Report 2010
Govern Ance : Directors' report - continued The Business Principles are supplemented  
by four Anglo American  Way' documents, 
covering the safety, environmental, 
occupational health and social aspects  
of sustainable development. These set  
out specific standards for each of these 
subject areas. 
Copies of the Good Citizenship: Our Business 
Principles and the Anglo American  Way' 
documents are available from the Company 
and may be accessed on the Company's 
website at www.angloamerican.com
The Business Integrity Policy and 
Performance Standards set out how Group 
employees, business partners and major 
suppliers must act to ensure that our zero 
tolerance of corruption is upheld. During 2010, 
training was held at all Business Units for 
employees to embed knowledge of the policy 
as well as the recently enacted UK Bribery Act 
and how to behave in corruption risk 
situations. This training will be ongoing and 
mandatory for all senior levels and others 
where it is deemed appropriate. 
The Group has a well-used enterprise 
information portal, theSource, which seeks to 
ensure that employees are regularly updated 
on developments within the Group, and 
feedback is encouraged. In addition, the 
Company regularly publishes Optima 
(available on the Company's website) and 
OurWorld, which contain items of news, 
current affairs and information relevant to 
Group employees.
Charita Ble donations During the year, Anglo American, its 
subsidiaries and the Anglo American Group 
Foundation made donations for charitable 
purposes or wider social investments 
amounting to $1 1 1 million (1.31% of operating 
profit from subsidiaries and joint ventures). 
Charitable donations of $0.8 million were 
made in the UK, of which the main categories 
were: education and training (43%) and 
community development (39%). These 
figures were compiled with reference to the 
London Benchmarking Group model for 
defining and measuring social investment 
spending. A fuller analysis of the Group's 
social investment activities can be found in  
the Sustainable Development Report 2010.
p oliti Cal donations No political donations were made during 2010. 
Anglo American has an established policy of 
not making donations to, or incurring expenses 
for the benefit of, any political party in any part 
of the world, including any political party or 
political organisation as defined in the Political 
Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.
a nnual g eneral m eeting The AGM will be held on 21 April 201 1 when 
shareholders will have the opportunity to put 
questions to the Board, including the chairmen 
of the various committees. A separate booklet 
enclosed with this report contains the notice 
convening the meeting together with a 
description of the business to be conducted.
Facilities have been put in place to enable 
shareholders on the UK register to receive 
Company communications electronically 
rather than by mail and, for those unable to 
attend the meeting, to cast their votes by 
electronic means, including those 
shareholders whose shares are held in the 
CREST system.
In accordance with best practice, voting on 
each resolution to be proposed at the AGM 
will be conducted on a poll rather than by  
a show of hands. The results of the poll will  
be announced to the press and on the 
Company's website.
 
ele Ctroni C Communi Cations 
As a result of the implementation of the 
electronic communications provisions in the 
Companies Act 2006, the Company has 
substantially reduced the cost of annual report 
production and distribution. Shareholders may 
elect to receive notification by email of the 
availability of the annual report on the 
Company's website instead of receiving  
paper copies.
a dditional information  
for shareholders Set out below is a summary of certain 
provisions of the Company's current Articles 
of Association (the Articles) and applicable 
English law concerning companies (the 
Companies Act 2006 (the Companies Act)) 
required as a result of the implementation of 
the Takeovers Directive in English law. This is  
a summary only and the relevant provisions of 
the Articles or the Companies Act should be 
consulted if further information is required.
Dividends and distributions
Subject to the provisions of the Companies 
Act, the Company may by ordinary resolution 
from time to time declare dividends not 
exceeding the amount recommended by the 
Board. The Board may pay interim dividends 
whenever the financial position of the 
Company, in the opinion of the Board, justifies 
such payment.
The Board may withhold payment of all or any 
part of any dividends or other monies payable 
in respect of the Company's shares from a 
person with a 0.25% interest or more (as 
defined in the Articles) if such a person has 
been served with a notice after failing to 
provide the Company with information 
concerning interests in those shares required 
to be provided under the Companies Act.
Rights and obligations attaching  
to shares
The rights and obligations attaching to the 
ordinary and preference shares are set out in 
the Articles. The Articles may only be changed 
by the shareholders by special resolution.
Voting
Subject to the Articles generally and to any 
special rights or restrictions as to voting 
attached by or in accordance with the Articles 
to any class of shares, on a show of hands 
every member who is present in person at a 
general meeting shall have one vote and, on a 
poll, every member who is present in person 
or by proxy shall have one vote for every share 
of which he/she is the holder. It is, and has 
been for some years, the Company's practice 
to hold a poll on every resolution at 
shareholder meetings.

Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Other information Where shares are held by trustees/nominees 
in respect of the Group's employee share 
plans and the voting rights attached to such 
shares are not directly exercisable by the 
employees, it is the Company's practice that 
such rights are not exercised by the relevant 
trustee/nominee.
Under the Companies Act, members are 
entitled to appoint a proxy, who need not be a 
member of the Company, to exercise all or any 
of their rights to attend and to speak and vote 
on their behalf at a general meeting or class 
meeting. A member may appoint more than 
one proxy in relation to a general meeting or 
class meeting provided that each proxy is 
appointed to exercise the rights attached to a 
different share or shares held by that member. 
A member that is a corporation may appoint 
one or more individuals to act on its behalf at a 
general meeting or class meeting as a 
corporate representative. The debate around 
s323 of the Companies Act has been resolved 
so that where a shareholder appoints more 
than one corporate representative in respect 
of its shareholding, but in respect of different 
shares, those corporate representatives can 
act independently of each other, and validly 
vote in different ways.
Restrictions on voting
No member shall, unless the directors 
otherwise determine, be entitled in respect of 
any share held by him/her to vote either 
personally or by proxy at a shareholders' 
meeting or to exercise any other right 
conferred by membership in relation to 
shareholders' meetings if any call or other sum 
presently payable by him/her to the Company 
in respect of that share remains unpaid. In 
addition, no member shall be entitled to vote if 
he/she has been served with a notice after 
failing to provide the Company with 
information concerning interests in those 
shares required to be provided under the 
Companies Act.
Issue of shares
Subject to the provisions of the Companies 
Act relating to authority and pre-emption 
rights and of any resolution of the Company in 
a UK general meeting, all unissued shares of 
the Company shall be at the disposal of the 
directors and they may allot (with or without 
conferring a right of renunciation), grant 
options over or otherwise dispose of them to 
such persons, at such times and on such terms 
as they think proper.
Shares in uncertificated form
Directors may determine that any class of 
shares may be held in uncertificated form and 
title to such shares may be transferred by 
means of a relevant system or that shares of 
any class should cease to be so held and 
transferred. Subject to the provisions of the 
Companies Act, the CREST Regulations and 
every other statute, statutory instrument, 
regulation or order for the time being in force 
concerning companies and affecting the 
Company (together, the Statutes), the 
directors may determine that any class of 
shares held on the branch register of 
members of the Company resident in South 
Africa or any other overseas branch register of 
the members of the Company may be held in 
uncertificated form in accordance with any 
system outside the UK which enables title to 
such shares to be evidenced and transferred 
without a written instrument and which is a 
relevant system. The provisions of the Articles 
shall not apply to shares of any class which are 
in uncertificated form to the extent that the 
Articles are inconsistent with the holding of 
shares of that class in uncertificated form, the 
transfer of title to shares of that class by 
means of a relevant system or any provision of 
the CREST Regulations.
Deadlines for exercising voting rights
Votes are exercisable at a general meeting  
of the Company in respect of which the 
business being voted upon is being heard. 
Votes may be exercised in person, by proxy, or 
in relation to corporate members, by corporate 
representative. The Articles provide a deadline 
for submission of proxy forms of not than less 
than 48 hours before the time appointed for the 
holding of the meeting or adjourned meeting.
Variation of rights
Subject to statute, the Articles specify that 
rights attached to any class of shares may be 
varied with the written consent of the holders 
of not less than three-quarters in nominal 
value of the issued shares of that class, or with 
the sanction of an extraordinary resolution 
passed at a separate general meeting of the 
holders of those shares. At every such 
separate general meeting the quorum shall  
be two persons holding or representing by 
proxy at least one-third in nominal value of  
the issued shares of the class (calculated 
excluding any shares held as treasury shares). 
The rights conferred upon the holders of any 
shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly 
provided in the rights attaching to those 
shares, be deemed to be varied by the 
creation or issue of further shares ranking  
pari passu with them.
Transfer of shares
All transfers of shares which are in  
certificated form may be effected by transfer 
in writing in any usual or common form or in 
any other form acceptable to the directors  
and may be under hand only. The instrument 
of transfer shall be signed by or on behalf of 
the transferor and (except in the case of 
fully-paid shares) by or on behalf of the 
transferee. The transferor shall remain the 
holder of the shares concerned until the name 
of the transferee is entered in the register. All 
transfers of shares which are in uncertificated 
form may be effected by means of the  
CREST system.
The directors may decline to recognise any 
instrument of transfer relating to shares in 
certificated form unless it:
(a) is in respect of only one class of share; and
(b) is lodged at the transfer office (duly 
stamped if required) accompanied by the 
relevant share certificate(s) and such 
other evidence as the directors may 
reasonably require to show the right of the 
transferor to make the transfer (and, if the 
instrument of transfer is executed by some 
other person on his/her behalf, the 
authority of that person so to do).
The directors may, in the case of shares in 
certificated form, in their absolute discretion 
and without assigning any reason therefor, 
refuse to register any transfer of shares (not 
being fully-paid shares) provided that, where 
any such shares are admitted to the Official 
List of the London Stock Exchange, such 
discretion may not be exercised in such a way 
as to prevent dealings in the shares of that 
class from taking place on an open and proper 
basis. The directors may also refuse to register 
an allotment or transfer of shares (whether 
fully paid or not) in favour of more than four 
persons jointly.
If the directors refuse to register an allotment 
or transfer, they shall send within two months 
after the date on which the letter of allotment 
or transfer was lodged with the Company, to 
the allottee or transferee, a notice of the 
refusal.
A shareholder does not need to obtain the 
approval of the Company, or of other 
shareholders of shares in the Company,  
for a transfer of shares to take place.
1 14 Anglo American plc     Annual Report 2010
Govern Ance : Directors' report - continued Directors
Directors shall not be less than ten nor more 
than 18 in number. A director is not required to 
hold any shares of the Company by way of 
qualification. The Company may by ordinary 
resolution increase or reduce the maximum  
or minimum number of directors.
Powers of directors
Subject to the Articles, the Companies Act and 
any directions given by special resolution, the 
business of the Company will be managed by 
the Board who may exercise all the powers of 
the Company.
The Board may exercise all the powers of the 
Company to borrow money and to mortgage 
or charge any of its undertaking, property  
and uncalled capital and to issue debentures 
and other securities, whether outright or  
as collateral security for any debt, liability  
or obligation of the Company or of any  
third party.
The Company may by ordinary resolution 
declare dividends but no dividend shall be 
payable in excess of the amount 
recommended by the directors. Subject to the 
provisions of the Articles and to the rights 
attaching to any shares, any dividends or other 
monies payable on or in respect of a share 
may be paid in such currency as the directors 
may determine. The directors may deduct 
from any dividend payable to any member all 
sums of money (if any) presently payable by 
him/her to the Company on account of calls or 
otherwise in relation to shares of the 
Company. The directors may retain any 
dividends payable on shares on which the 
Company has a lien, and may apply the same 
in or towards satisfaction of the debts, 
liabilities or engagements in respect of which 
the lien exists.
Appointment and replacement  
of directors
The directors may from time to time appoint 
one or more directors.
The Board may appoint any person to be a 
director (so long as the total number of 
directors does not exceed the limit prescribed 
in the Articles). Any such director shall hold 
office only until the next AGM and shall then 
be eligible for election.
The Articles provide that at each AGM all 
those directors who have been in office for 
three years or more since their election or last 
re-election shall retire from office. In addition, 
a director may at any AGM retire from office 
and stand for re-election. However, in 
accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, all directors will be  
subject to annual re-election.
Significant agreements: Change  
of control
At 31 December 2010, Anglo American had 
committed bilateral and syndicated borrowing 
facilities totalling $14.4 billion with a number of 
relationship banks which contain change of 
control clauses. The ZAR 20 billion South 
African Medium Term Note Programme and 
$7.3 billion of the Group's bond issues also 
contain change of control provisions. In 
aggregate, this financing is considered 
significant to the Group and in the event of a 
takeover (change of control) of the Company, 
these contracts may be cancelled, become 
immediately payable or be subject to 
acceleration. 
Purchases of own shares
At the AGM held on 22 April 2010, authority 
was given for the Company to purchase,  
in the market, up to 197.3 million Ordinary 
Shares of 54
86
/ 91 US cents each. The 
Company did not purchase any of its own 
shares during 2010.
Indemnities
To the extent permitted by law and the Articles 
the Company has made qualifying third party 
indemnity provisions for the benefit of its 
directors during the year and which remain in 
force at the date of this report. Copies of these 
indemnities are open for inspection at the 
Company's registered office.

Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Other information The directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable  
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law the directors are required to 
prepare the group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation and have elected to prepare the 
parent company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and 
applicable law). Under company law the 
directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
company and of the profit or loss of the 
company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
  Select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently
  Make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent
  State whether applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements
  Prepare the financial statements 
on the going concern basis unless it  
is inappropriate to presume that the  
company will continue in business
In preparing the group financial statements, 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires 
that directors:
  Properly select and apply accounting 
policies
  Present information, including accounting 
policies, in a manner that provides relevant, 
reliable, comparable and understandable 
information
  Provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific requirements 
in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users  
to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions  
on the entity's financial position and 
financial performance
  Make an assessment of the company's 
ability to continue as a going concern
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the company's 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position  
of the company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with  
the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of  
the company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of  
fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
company's website. Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Company financial 
statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters  
we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors' responsibilities, the 
directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit  
and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board's (APB's) Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group's and the Company's circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's 
and of the Company's affairs as at 31 December 2010 and of the Group's 
profit for the year then ended;
  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
  the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting  
Practice; and
  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
  the part of the Remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
  the information given in the Directors' report for the financial year for which 
the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or
  the Company financial statements and the part of the Remuneration report to 
be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
  certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
  the directors' statement contained within the Directors' report in relation to 
going concern; 
  the part of the Corporate governance section relating to the Company's 
compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 Combined Code 
specified for our review; and
  certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors' 
remuneration.
