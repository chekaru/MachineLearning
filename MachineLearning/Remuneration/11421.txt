THE ECONOMY
FALTERING ECONOMIC RECOVERY
Early in 201 1, the world economy appeared  
to be growing robustly. Most regions were 
enjoying robust economic growth after the 
dislocation of the global financial crisis and  
a severe recession. The large emerging 
economies - notably China, India and Brazil 
- were leading the upswing, but there were 
also more encouraging trends in the major 
advanced economies. During the year, all  
of the world's major economies faltered, 
contributing to a marked global slowdown. 
There were three reasons.
First, there were some significant  shocks' 
during the year. Political uncertainty in North 
Africa and the Middle East pushed up oil 
prices, which depressed activity in the major 
oil-importing countries. Additionally, Japan's 
earthquake/tsunami and consequent nuclear 
power emergency led to a severe fall in 
domestic production and severely disrupted 
global supply chains, notably in the auto 
industry. The recovery has been slow.
Second, policy settings in the emerging 
economies became much more restrictive  
in the first half of 201 1, contributing to the 
slowdown in the second half. In particular, 
central banks tightened monetary policy 
aggressively as they sought to restrain 
inflationary pressure. The Brazilian central 
bank was particularly aggressive and its 
monetary tightening led to a pronounced 
economic slowdown in 201 1. The Reserve 
Bank of India (RBI) and the People's Bank  
of China (PBOC) also tightened policy 
appreciably, with the macro-economic 
effects becoming clearer during 201 1.
Third, Europe's financial crisis intensified 
during 201 1. Critically, the crisis spread  
from small peripheral economies to larger 
economies at the core of the euro zone. 
During the year, financial markets began  
to question the government solvency of 
Spain and Italy. Additionally, investors 
became much more nervous about the 
implications of strained government finances 
on the European banking system. In spite of a 
series of policy initiatives, markets remained 
sceptical that policymakers would resolve the 
crisis. Increasing market volatility and rising 
risk premiums contributed to a European 
economic slowdown.
THE MACRO!ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
By the end of 201 1, most of the world's 
leading economies had reported a material 
weakening. China, India and Brazil reported 
slower GDP growth rates and falling inflation. 
This opened up the scope for looser policy. 
Brazil and China have already moved to 
loosen policy settings and this should help  
to cushion their economies in 2012. Lower 
inflation should enable the RBI to loosen 
monetary policy, which should also support 
India's economy. In 2012, real GDP growth 
should be lower than in 201 1, but the major 
emerging economies should avoid a  
sharp downturn.
In the longer term, we expect  
further significant growth in  
the main emerging economies  
as they  catch up' with the  
advanced economies.
Surprisingly, the US economy strengthened 
late in 201 1 as the effects of higher oil prices 
and the disruption from Japan's natural 
disaster began to fade. While there are still 
some concerns around the economy's 
underlying growth rate, further policy 
stimulus should support a continuing 
recovery in 2012.
Europe remains the principal source of 
concern. There are growing worries that the 
crisis has now become so complex there is  
no practicable solution. It is possible this 
could lead to a further intensification of the 
crisis in 2012 and a deep recession. More 
likely, policymakers seem to have done 
enough to contain the crisis. Governments 
have emphasised their commitment to 
stabilising the euro and the European Central 
Bank (ECB) has become more involved in 
providing liquidity. This should be enough to 
remove the extreme downside risks to the 
economy and the financial system.
In the longer term, we expect further 
significant growth in the main emerging 
economies as they  catch up' with the 
advanced economies. With real GDP per 
capita still well below levels in the US, there is 
considerable scope for the convergence of 
living standards through technology transfer 
and productivity gains. Over the next decade, 
this should mean all of the major emerging 
economies grow rapidly.
