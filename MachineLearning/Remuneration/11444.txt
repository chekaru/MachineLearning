HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE WITH  
OUR INVESTORS?
We place a great deal of importance on 
maintaining an active dialogue with our 
investor base around the world. We plan  
to increase our interaction in 2012 by  
further exposing our operating management 
to investors.
The Company maintains an active 
engagement with its key financial audiences, 
including institutional shareholders and  
sell side analysts as well as potential 
shareholders. The Investor Relations 
department manages the interaction with 
these audiences and regular presentations 
take place at the time of interim and final 
results as well as during the rest of the year. 
An active programme of communication with 
potential shareholders is also maintained.
Board oversight
Any significant concerns raised by a 
shareholder in relation to the Company  
and its affairs are communicated to the 
Board. The Board is briefed on a regular  
basis by the Investor Relations department 
and analysts' reports are circulated to the 
directors. Feedback from meetings held 
between executive management, or the 
Investor Relations Department, and 
institutional shareholders is also 
communicated to the Board.
Institutional investors
During the year there were regular 
presentations to, and meetings with, 
institutional investors in the UK, South Africa, 
continental Europe, the US and Asia Pacific 
to communicate the strategy and 
performance of Anglo American. Executive 
directors, as well as key executives, including 
business unit heads, host such presentations, 
including seminars for investors and analysts, 
and one-on-one meetings. Throughout the 
year, executive management also presents  
at industry conferences, which are mainly 
organised by investment banks for their 
institutional investor base. In late 2010, 
Sir John Parker met with a number of key 
investors to discuss  Strategy, The Board, 
Board Changes & Operating Performance'. 
David Challen in his capacity as the SID  
works closely with Sir John to maintain his 
understanding of the issues and concerns  
of major shareholders. David Challen 
attended the Australian site visit dinner with 
analysts and investors. The chairman, SID 
and other non executive directors are also 
available to shareholders to discuss any 
matter they wish to raise. We look forward  
to increased communication with investors 
following the recent introduction of the 
Stewardship Code.
The Company's website provides  
the latest news and historical financial 
information, details about forthcoming  
events for shareholders and analysts, and 
other information on Anglo American.

WHAT ARE THE COMMITTEES OF THE 
BOARD AND WHAT DO THEY DO?
Subject to those matters reserved for its 
decision, the Board delegates certain 
responsibilities to a number of standing 
committees - the Safety and Sustainable 
Development, Remuneration, Nomination 
and Audit Committees. The terms of 
reference for each of these committees 
and a schedule of matters reserved for 
the Board's decision are published on the 
Company's website.
SAFETY & SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE
Composition
 Peter Woicke - chairman 
 Cynthia Carroll 
 Sir John Parker
 Ray O'Rourke
 Mamphela Ramphele
 Jack Thompson 
 Brian Beamish 
 David Weston
Roles and responsibilities
 Reviewing the development  
of framework policies and 
guidelines for the management 
of sustainable development 
(SD) issues including safety, 
health and environment.
 Reviewing the performance  
of the Company and the 
progressive implementation  
of its safety and sustainable 
development (S&SD) policies. 
 Receiving reports covering 
matters relating to material 
S&SD risks and liabilities.
 Monitoring key indicators and 
learning on incidents and, 
where appropriate, ensuring 
they are communicated 
throughout the Group.
 Considering material  
national and international 
regulatory and technical 
developments in the fields  
of S&SD management.
Besides the regular S&SD 
Committee members, the 
meetings were well attended by 
other Group directors and 
business unit (BU) CEOs. At each 
meeting the Committee received 
a functional performance review 
led by the Group chief executive, 
Cynthia Carroll. Safety remains a 
critical focus area and receives 
significant attention at each 
meeting. Key themes such as 
occupational health, HIV and 
AIDS, energy, climate change, 
water, social performance and 
SD within our supply chain were 
reviewed at each meeting. Other 
topics, such as gender diversity, 
received periodic focus.
What did the Committee 
discuss in 2011?
 A detailed account of every 
fatal incident that occurred  
in the period under review  
by the relevant BU CEO,  
along with the related 
management response.
 Oversight of risk, including 
major risks such as methane 
explosion; technical risks such 
as waste containment facilities 
and shaft infrastructure; an 
annual review of legal risk 
across the Group; and 
significant outcomes of 
external assurance work.
 Presentations by BU CEOs  
on a rotational basis on  
that respective business'  
SD performance.
 Presentations by NGOs  
on issues important to the 
business. For example,  
the Committee received 
presentations by the Institute 
for Human Rights on the links 
between business, human 
rights and water.
 Reports on projects of  
strategic interest such as the 
value of S&SD.
The S&SD Committee's remit spans 
across the environmental, social and 
workplace risks and opportunities 
faced by Anglo American. Increasingly, 
we seek out investments to effect 
positive change in more than one of 
these areas. For example, a new 
enterprise development fund in  
South Africa has been established  
to help create jobs while delivering 
environmental benefits. The Zimele 
Green Fund will target investment 
opportunities that mitigate carbon 
emissions, reduce energy and water 
consumption, and improve waste and 
emissions management. Created in 
November 2011, the Fund is already 
reviewing potential investments to 
assess their commercial and 
technical viability and degree of 
alignment with Anglo American's 
environmental objectives, such as  
the retrofitting of low income 
government provided housing in 
South Africa with solar water heaters.
To be successful, sustainability 
considerations need to be integral  
to our thinking in all areas of our 
business, such as in the design and 
evaluation of our projects, mine 
planning and decommissioning, and 
the ways in which capital is allocated 
to fund our projects.

GOVERNANCE BOARD IN ACTION  Anglo American plc  Annual Report 201 1 101
Governance
 Any partner designated as a key audit 
partner of Anglo American shall not be 
employed by Anglo American in a key 
management position unless a period of  
at least two years has elapsed since the 
conclusion of the last relevant audit.
 The external auditors are required to assess 
periodically, in their professional judgement, 
whether they are independent of the Group.
 The Audit Committee ensures that the 
scope of the auditors' work is sufficient and 
that the auditors are fairly remunerated.
 The Audit Committee has primary 
responsibility for making recommendations 
to the Board on the appointment,  
re-appointment and removal of the  
external auditors.
 The Audit Committee has the authority  
to engage independent counsel and  
other advisers as they determine necessary 
in order to resolve issues on auditor 
independence.
 An annual assessment is undertaken of  
the auditors' performance, independence 
and objectivity. The results are shared with 
the Audit Committee.
What did the Audit Committee 
conclude for 2011?
The Audit Committee has satisfied itself  
that the United Kingdom professional and 
regulatory requirements for audit partner 
rotation and employment of former 
employees of the external auditors have  
been complied with.
The Audit Committee considered information 
pertaining to the balance between fees for 
audit and non audit work for the Group in 
201 1 and concluded that the nature and 
extent of the non audit fees do not present a 
threat to the external auditors' independence. 
Details of fees paid are provided on page 140.
Furthermore, after reviewing a report from 
the external auditors on all their relationships 
with Anglo American that might reasonably 
have a bearing on the external auditors' 
independence and the audit engagement 
partner and staff's objectivity, and the related 
safeguards and procedures, the Committee 
has concluded that the external auditors' 
independence was not impaired.
The Audit Committee held meetings with the 
external auditors without the presence of 
management on two occasions and the 
chairman of the Audit Committee held 
regular meetings with the audit engagement 
partner during the year. 
What will the Audit Committee do  
in 2012?
During 2012 the Audit Committee will 
continue its role in monitoring the integrity  
of the financial statements and reviewing  
the effectiveness of the Company's internal 
control and risk management systems. An 
item of key interest to the Audit Committee  
will be to understand how the risk and audit 
processes operate in De Beers and how 
these will be integrated into Anglo American 
at the appropriate time.
How is the appointment of the external 
auditors considered?
The appointment of Deloitte LLP as the 
Group's external auditors (incumbents since 
the listing in 1999) is kept under annual 
review, and if satisfactory, the Committee  
will recommend the re-appointment of the 
audit firm. The appointment of Deloitte LLP 
followed a detailed evaluation, at the time of 
the listing, of the predecessor audit firms and, 
rather than adopting a policy on tendering 
frequency, an annual review of the 
effectiveness of the external audit is 
supplemented by a periodic, comprehensive 
reassessment by the Committee. The 
Committee's assessment of the external 
auditors' performance and independence 
underpins its recommendation to the  
Board to propose to shareholders the 
re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as auditors  
until the conclusion of the AGM in 2013. 
Resolutions to authorise the Board to 
re-appoint and determine their remuneration 
will be proposed at the AGM on 19 April 2012.
What is the role of internal audit?
The Group has an internal audit department 
that reports centrally with responsibility for 
reviewing and providing assurance on the 
adequacy of the internal control environment 
across all of Anglo American's operations. 
The head of internal audit is responsible for 
reporting and following up on the findings of 
this internal audit work to local management 
and the Audit Committee on a regular basis. 
Internal audit teams operated in all the 
Group's principal divisions in the period under 
review, reporting findings to local senior 
management. The internal audit function's 
mandate and annual audit coverage plans 
were approved by the Audit Committee.
The internal audit activities are performed  
by teams of appropriate, qualified and 
experienced employees, supplemented  
if necessary through the engagement of 
external practitioners upon specified and 
agreed terms. A summary of audit results  
and risk management information was 
presented to the Committee and Group 
AUDIT COMMITTEE 
REPORT
HOW DO WE ENSURE INDEPENDENCE 
OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITORS?
Anglo American's policy on auditors' 
independence, is consistent with the  
ethical standards published by the Audit 
Practices Board.
A key factor that may impair auditors' 
independence is a lack of control over  
non audit services provided by the external 
auditors. In essence, the external auditors' 
independence is deemed to be impaired if 
the auditors provide a service which:
 results in the auditors acting as a manager 
or employee of the Group
 puts the auditors in the role of advocate  
for the Group; or
 creates a mutuality of interest between  
the auditors and the Group.
Anglo American addresses this issue  
through three primary measures, namely:
 disclosure of the extent and nature of  
non audit services
 the prohibition of selected services -  
this includes the undertaking of internal 
audit services
 prior approval by the Audit Committee 
chairman of non audit services where the 
cost of the proposed assignment is likely  
to exceed $50,000.
Anglo American's policy on the provision  
of non audit services is regularly reviewed. 
The definition of prohibited non audit  
services corresponds with the European 
Commission's recommendations on auditors' 
independence and with the Ethical Standards 
issued by the Audit Practices Board in the UK.
What other safeguards exist?
 The external auditors are required to adhere 
to a rotation policy based on best practice 
and professional standards in the United 
Kingdom. The standard period for rotation 
of the audit engagement partner is five 
years and, for any key audit partner, seven 
years. The audit engagement partner  
was appointed in 2010 in accordance  
with this requirement.
GOVERNANCE AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 102 Anglo American plc  Annual Report 201 1
senior management at regular intervals 
throughout the year. The Group's head of 
internal audit reports to the Audit Committee 
on the internal audit function's performance 
against the agreed internal audit plan.
During 201 1, over 420 audit projects were 
completed covering a variety of financial, 
operational, strategic and compliance related 
business processes across all business units 
and functions. In addition, the internal audit 
department responded to a number of 
management requests to investigate alleged 
breaches of our business principles.
HOW IS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF 
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK 
MANAGEMENT ASSESSED?
The GMC, as mandated by the Board, 
maintains a Group wide system of internal 
control to manage significant Group risks. 
This system, which has been operating 
throughout the year and to the date of this 
report, supports the Board in discharging its 
responsibility for ensuring that the wide range 
of risks associated with the Group's diverse 
international operations is effectively 
managed in support of the creation and 
preservation of shareholder wealth. Please 
see pages 48 to 53 for further information  
on the key risk factors Anglo American is 
exposed to. Where appropriate, necessary 
action has been or is being taken to remedy 
any failings or weakness identified from 
review of the effectiveness of the internal 
control system.
How is assurance obtained on the 
internal control environment?
The system of internal control, which is 
embedded in all key operations, provides 
reasonable rather than absolute assurance 
that the Group's business objectives will be 
achieved within the risk tolerance levels 
defined by the Board. Regular management 
reporting, which provides a balanced 
assessment of key risks and controls, is an 
important component of board assurance.  
In addition, certain Board Committees focus 
on specific risks such as safety and capital 
investment and provide assurance to the 
Board. The chief financial officers of the 
Group's business units provide confirmation, 
on a six monthly basis, that financial and 
accounting control frameworks have 
operated satisfactorily. The Board also 
receives assurance from the Audit 
Committee, which derives its information,  
in part, from regular internal audit reports  
on risk and internal control throughout the 
Group and external audit reporting. The 
Group's internal audit function has a formal 
collaboration process in place with the 
external auditors to ensure efficient coverage 
of internal controls. The Anglo American 
internal audit function is responsible for 
providing independent assurance to 
executive management and the Board on  
the effectiveness of the risk management 
process throughout the Group.
Anglo American seeks to have a sound 
system of internal control, based on the 
Group's policies and guidelines, in all material 
associates and joint ventures. In those 
companies that are independently managed, 
as well as joint ventures, the directors who are 
represented on these organisations' boards 
seek assurance that significant risks are 
being managed.
Assurance regarding the accuracy and 
reliability of Mineral Resources and Ore 
Reserves disclosure is provided through a 
combination of internal technically proficient 
staff and independent third parties.
Whistleblowing programme
The Group has had in place for a number of 
years a whistleblowing programme in all its 
managed operations. The programme, which 
is monitored by the Audit Committee, is 
designed to enable employees, customers, 
suppliers, managers or other stakeholders, 
on a confidential basis, to raise concerns in 
cases where conduct is deemed to be 
contrary to our values. It may include:
 actions that may result in danger to the 
health and/or safety of people or damage  
to the environment
 unethical practice in accounting, internal 
accounting controls, financial reporting and 
auditing matters
 criminal offences, including money 
laundering, fraud, bribery and corruption
 failure to comply with any legal obligation
 miscarriage of justice
 any conduct contrary to the ethical 
principles embraced in our Business 
Principles or any similar policy
 any other legal or ethical concern
 concealment of any of the above.
BUSINESS INTEGRITY
During 2011 we continued 
to implement the 
necessary procedures to 
ensure that our Business 
Integrity policy operates 
effectively across the 
Group, and minimises the 
risk of bribery as far as 
possible. We have now 
trained over 2,000 
managers through 
workshops in the business 
units and developed 
supplementary online 
training. During the year 
we developed enhanced 
guidelines regarding 
acceptance and provision 
of gifts and entertainment 
and provided specific 
guidance on due  
diligence procedures for 
transactions where risks 
are considered higher. We 
conducted an assessment 
of the risks of bribery and 
corruption in each of our 
businesses taking into 
consideration external  
and internal factors and 
identified those areas 
where additional measures 
are necessary. We applied 
a risk assessment process 
in individual transactions 
to identify necessary 
actions that mitigate risk 
of bribery in those 
arrangements.
For 2012 we will continue 
to develop our procedures 
and obtain assurance  
that they are being 
implemented as we expect 
across the Group.

of telephonic, email, web based and surface 
mail communication channels to any person 
in the world who has information about 
unethical practice in Anglo American and  
its managed operations. The multilingual 
communication facilities are operated by 
independent service providers who remove 
all indications from information received as to 
the identity of the callers before submission 
to designated persons in the Group.
During 201 1, 299 reports were received via 
the global  Speakup' facility, covering a broad 
spectrum of concerns, including:
 ethical
 criminal
 supplier relationships
 health and safety
 human resource type issues.
Reports received were kept strictly 
confidential and were referred to appropriate 
line managers within the Group for resolution. 
Where appropriate, action was taken to 
address the issues raised. The reports are 
analysed and monitored to ensure the 
process is effective.
How does risk management work at 
Anglo American?
The Board's policy on risk management 
encompasses all significant business risks  
to the Group, including:
 financial risk
 operational, including safety, technical, 
fraud and corruption risk
 compliance risk 
which could undermine the achievement  
of business objectives.
This system of risk management is  
designed so that the different businesses  
are able to tailor and adapt their risk 
management processes to suit their specific 
circumstances. This flexible approach has  
the commitment of the Group's senior 
management. There is clear accountability 
for risk management, which is a key 
performance area of line managers through 
the Group. The requisite risk and control 
capability is assured through Board challenge 
and appropriate management selection and 
skills development. Managers are supported 
in giving effect to their risk responsibilities 
through policies and guidelines on risk and 
control management. Support through 
facilitated risk assessments is provided by 
a central team responsible for ensuring 
a robust process is implemented for risk 
management. During 201 1, over 149 
separate risk assessment workshops were 
conducted reviewing:
 risk in business unit strategies
 risks to achieving mine plans
 risks in capital projects
 risks to key change programmes.
The results of these risk assessments were 
reported to senior management and the 
Audit Committee. The process of risk 
management is designed to identify internal 
and external threats to the business and to 
assist management in prioritising their 
response to those risks. Continuous 
monitoring of risk and control processes, 
across headline risk areas and other business 
specific risk areas, provides the basis for 
regular and exception reporting  
to business management and boards, ExCo, 
the Audit Committee and the Board.
Some of the headline risk areas, which  
have been elaborated upon in the financial 
review, set out on pages 48 to 53, are:
 commodity price risk
 political risk
 counterparty risk
 infrastructure and operational  
performance risks.
The risk assessment and reporting criteria 
are designed to provide the Board with a 
consistent, Group wide perspective of the  
key risks. The reports to the Board, which are 
submitted at least every six months, include 
an assessment of the likelihood and impact of 
risks materialising, as well as risk mitigation 
initiatives and their effectiveness.
In conducting its annual review of the 
effectiveness of risk management, the Board 
considers the key findings from the ongoing 
monitoring and reporting processes, 
management assertions and independent 
assurance reports. The Board also takes 
account of material changes and trends in the 
risk profile and considers whether the control 
system, including reporting, adequately 
supports the Board in achieving its risk 
management objectives.
During the course of the year the Board 
considered the Group's responsiveness to 
changes within its business environment.  
The Board is satisfied that there is an ongoing 
process, which has been operational during  104 Anglo American plc  Annual Report 201 1

REMUNERATION REPORT
OF THE DIRECTORS
It is important to ensure that levels of reward  
are commensurate with performance and  
that the Company's reward policy creates a 
strong alignment between its shareholders  
and executives.

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee  Anglo American plc  Annual Report 201 1 105
Governance
2.  P OLICY ON EXECUTIVE  
DIRECTOR REMUNERATION
The Company's remuneration policy is 
formulated to attract and retain high-calibre 
executives and to motivate them to develop 
and implement the Company's business 
strategy in order to optimise long-term 
shareholder value creation. The Committee 
intends that this policy will continue to apply 
for 2012 and subsequent years, subject to 
ongoing review as appropriate. The policy is 
framed around the following key principles: 
 Total rewards will be set at levels that are 
sufficiently competitive to enable the 
recruitment and retention of high-calibre 
executives.
 Incentive-based rewards will be earned 
through the achievement of demanding 
performance conditions consistent with 
shareholder interests.
 Incentive plans, performance measures  
and targets will be structured to operate 
soundly throughout the business cycle.
 The design of long-term incentives will be 
prudent and will not expose shareholders  
to unreasonable financial risk.
 In considering the market positioning  
of reward elements, account will be  
taken of the performance of the Company 
and of the individual executive director.
 Reward practice will conform to best 
practice standards as far as reasonably 
practicable.
Representatives of the Company's principal 
investors are consulted on material changes 
to remuneration policy. The Committee 
Chairman consulted with this group of 
investors on the LTIP changes and the 
Chairman's share award in the first quarter  
of 201 1.
3.  ELEMENTS OF EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTOR REMUNERATION
3.1 Remuneration mix
Each executive director's total remuneration 
consists of basic salary, annual bonus, 
long-term incentives and benefits. An 
appropriate balance is maintained between 
fixed and performance-related remuneration 
and between elements linked to short-term 
financial performance and those linked to 
longer-term shareholder value creation.
Assuming on-target performance, the 
Committee's policy is that at least 50%  
(60% for Cynthia Carroll) of each executive 
director's remuneration is performance-
related. In 201 1, 78% of the chief executive's 
and 76% of the finance director's 
remuneration on an expected-value basis 
was performance-related as shown in  
Figure 2 on page 106.
The Bonus Share Plan (BSP) and the  
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) are 
designed to align the longer-term interests  
of shareholders and executives and to 
underpin the Company's performance 
culture. The Committee monitors the 
relevance and appropriateness of the 
performance measures and targets 
applicable to both plans. Further details  
of the BSP and the LTIP are set out on  
pages 106 to 109.
Incentive levels are set taking account of  
the median expected value of long-term 
incentives relative to other companies of  
a similar size. 
3.2 Basic salary
The basic salary of the executive directors 
is reviewed annually and is targeted at the 
market median of companies of comparable 
size, market sector, business complexity and 
international scope. This is adjusted (either 
way) based on experience and other relevant 
factors. The market for executives of 
main-board calibre, in large international 
mining companies in particular, has 
continued to be very competitive in recent 
years and it is therefore deemed sensible to 
position basic salary for executive directors  
at no lower than the median point. Company 
performance, individual performance and 
changes in responsibilities are also taken  
into consideration in setting salary levels  
each year.
Basic salary increases for executive  
directors with effect from January 2012  
were limited to an inflation adjustment in  
line with the general salary review for the 
broader employee population.

GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
3.3 Bonus Share Plan (BSP)
The BSP was first operated in 2004 and all 
executive directors are normally eligible to 
participate in it.
The BSP requires executive directors to 
invest a significant proportion of their 
remuneration in shares, thereby more  
closely aligning their interests with those of 
shareholders, and encourages management 
at all levels to build up a meaningful personal 
stake in the Company. Awards under the BSP 
are not pensionable, are made annually and 
consist of three elements:
 A performance-related cash element.
 Bonus Shares as a conditional  
award, normally to a value equal to  
the cash element.
 An additional performance-related element 
in the form of Enhancement Shares.
The award and matching levels are 
summarised in Figure 4. The BSP operates  
as follows: 
 The value of the bonus is calculated by 
reference to achievement against annual 
performance targets which include 
measures of corporate (and, if applicable, 
business unit) performance as well as  
the achievement of specific individual 
objectives. For executive directors, the 
corporate element is based on stretching 
earnings per share (EPS) targets which  
are calculated using underlying earnings 
(reconciled in note 13 of the financial 
statements). The key individual objectives 
are designed to support the Company's 
strategic priorities and in 201 1 included cost 
and asset optimisation, project execution, 
portfolio restructuring, strategic initiatives, 
organisational structure and capabilities, 
CSR initiatives and safety improvements.
 The Committee reviews these measures 
annually to ensure that they remain 
appropriate and sufficiently stretching in  
the context of the broader macro-economic 
outlook and more specific performance 
expectations for the Company and its 
operating businesses.
 In 201 1, 50% of each annual bonus was 
based on the corporate financial measure 
and the remaining 50% on key personal 
performance measures. This split is 
designed to reflect the importance of  
the ongoing projects and strategic 
repositioning of the Group as well as the 
volatile nature of commodity prices with  
the implications of this on setting earnings 
targets. Bonus parameters are set on an 
individual basis and the level of bonus 
payable is reduced if certain overall safety 
improvement targets are not met.
 In 201 1 the maximum cash element was 
87.5% of basic salary in the case of both 
Cynthia Carroll and Ren  M dori. Normally, 
half of any bonus earned is payable in cash 
and the other half is deferred into shares. 
The maximum bonus is payable only for 
meeting targets which, in the opinion of  
the Committee, represent an exceptional 
performance for the Group in the light of 
prevailing market conditions. The part of  
the bonus that is deferred is delivered in  
the form of a conditional award of Bonus 
Shares. These Bonus Shares vest only if the 
participant remains in employment with the 
Group until the end of a three-year holding 
period (or is regarded by the Committee as 
a  good leaver'). To increase the alignment 
with shareholders' interests, the Committee 
allows executive directors to elect to defer 
75% of the total bonus.
 The Committee is able to apply a clawback 
of deferred Bonus Shares in the event that, 
during the relevant deferral period, the 
Committee becomes aware of a material 
error in the Company's results for the 
relevant bonus performance period.
 Executive directors also receive a 
conditional award of Enhancement Shares 
at the same time as the award of Bonus 
Shares. The maximum potential, at face 
value, of the Enhancement Shares is 75% 
of the face value of the Bonus Shares. 
Awards of Enhancement Shares made in 
201 1 will vest after three years only to the 
extent that a challenging performance 
condition (based on earnings per share 
growth against growth in the UK Retail 
Price Index (RPI) - Real EPS growth) is  
met as shown in Figure 3. Real EPS  
growth is viewed as the most appropriate 
performance measure for this element  
of the BSP because it is a fundamental 
financial performance indicator, both 
internally and externally, and links directly  
to the Company's long-term objective of 
improving earnings. There is no retesting of 
this performance condition. Enhancement 
Shares will be subject to the same clawback 
provisions mentioned previously.
The BSP targets have been approved by the 
Committee after reviewing performance over 
a number of years and have been set at a level 
which provides stretching performance levels 
for management.

The level of performance achieved and the 
proportion of awards vesting in respect of 
each performance period will be published  
in the subsequent remuneration report.
3.4 Share options and all-employee 
share schemes
No share options were granted in 201 1 to 
executive directors under the Company's 
Discretionary Option Plan (DOP) and there  
is no intention to make future grants under 
the unapproved part of the DOP to executive 
directors. However, the DOP is retained for 
use in special circumstances relating to the 
recruitment or retention of key executives. 
UK-based executive directors are eligible  
to participate in the Company's Save As You 
Earn scheme (SAYE) and Share Incentive 
Plan (SIP). Performance conditions do not 
apply to these schemes because they are 
offered to all UK-based employees. 
3.5 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
At the AGM in April 201 1, shareholders 
approved a new LTIP to replace the previous 
LTIP , which expired in mid-201 1 and the main 
features are summarised in Figure 5.
Award levels
Conditional LTIP awards are granted annually 
to executive directors. The normal maximum 
award level under the LTIP is 350% and 
300% of basic salary respectively for the 
chief executive and finance director, with an 
overall scheme maximum of 350% of basic 
salary. It is anticipated that, in 2012, awards 
under the LTIP will be made at this level. The 
Committee is satisfied that the performance 
conditions that need to be met for these 
awards to vest in full are sufficiently stretching 
in the context of the award levels. These 
awards are discretionary and are considered 
on a case-by-case basis.
Performance measures
As in previous years, vesting of the LTIP 
awards made during 201 1 is subject to the 
achievement, over a fixed three-year period, 
of stretching Group performance targets.
Half of each award is subject to a Group  
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measure, 
while the other half is subject to a Group 
operational measure, an Asset Optimisation 
and Supply Chain (AOSC) efficiency 
measure. The measures are described in 
greater detail on the following page.

GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
These performance measures were selected 
on the basis that they foster the creation of 
shareholder value and their appropriateness 
is kept under review by the Committee. Taken 
as a whole, vesting depends on meeting a 
very challenging set of performance hurdles.
At the end of each performance period,  
the levels of TSR and AOSC performance 
achieved and the level of award earned will  
be published in the subsequent remuneration 
report. There is no retesting of the 
performance conditions.
The LTIP is intended closely to align the 
interests of shareholders and executive 
directors by rewarding superior shareholder 
returns and financial performance and by 
encouraging executives to build up a 
shareholding in the Company.
The Committee is able to apply a clawback  
of conditional LTIP awards in the event that, 
during the relevant performance period, the 
Committee becomes aware of a material 
error in the Company's results for the relevant 
performance period.
Total Shareholder Return 
The Committee considers comparative  
TSR to be a suitable long-term performance 
measure for the Company's LTIP awards. 
Executives would benefit under this measure 
only if shareholders have enjoyed returns on 
their investment which are superior to those 
that could have been obtained in other 
comparable companies.
50% of the proportion of each award that  
is based on TSR is measured against the 
Sector Index and 50% is measured against 
the constituents of the FTSE 100. Maximum 
vesting of the TSR element of an award  
will be possible only if Anglo American 
outperforms by a substantial margin both  
the sector benchmark (as described in the 
following section) and the largest UK 
companies across all sectors.
Sector Index comparison
One half of the TSR element of an LTIP  
award vests according to the Company's  
TSR over the performance period, relative  
to a weighted basket of international  
mining companies (the Sector Index). The 
Committee may amend the list of comparator 
companies in the Sector Index, and relative 
weightings, if circumstances make this 
necessary (for example, as a result of 
takeovers or mergers of comparator 
companies or significant changes in the 
composition of the Group). In calculating TSR 
it is assumed that all dividends are reinvested.
For awards made in 201 1, the companies 
constituting the Sector Index were as shown 
in Figure 6 on page 107. Should the Tarmac 
Group be sold or demerged during the 
performance period relating to this award, the 
percentage attributable to Industrial Minerals 
will fall to zero.
Target performance for the Sector Index is 
assessed by calculating the median TSR 
performance within each sub-sector 
category, and then weighting these medians 
by the category weightings shown in Figure 6 
on page 107. For 201 1 that part of any award 
that is contingent upon the Sector Index 
element of the TSR performance will vest  
as shown in Figure 7. Shares will vest on a 
straight-line basis for performance between 
the levels shown in Figure 7. 
FTSE 100 comparison
The vesting of the other half of the TSR 
element of an LTIP award will depend on  
the Company's TSR performance over the 
performance period compared with the 
constituents of the FTSE 100 Index, as 
outlined in Figure 8 for awards in 201 1. 
Shares will vest on a straight-line basis for 
performance between the levels shown  
in Figure 8.
The targets were calibrated such that for  
the TSR elements of the award there is 
approximately a 15% chance of achieving full 
vesting and a 25% chance of three-quarters 
vesting. These probabilities were assessed  
by PwC using the same Monte Carlo model 
used for calculating fair values of the LTIP 
under IFRS 2 (Share-based Payments). The 
estimated average fair value of an award 
under the TSR element using these proposed 
targets is 60% of the face value.

31 December 201 1 can be found in Figure 13 
on page 1 10.
Asset Optimisation and Supply Chain
AOSC is the second performance measure 
for LTIP awards and was introduced in 2010. 
The Company's AOSC programmes strive  
to unlock value from the Company's assets  
in a sustainable way through structured 
Group-wide programmes aimed at reducing 
costs, increasing volumes and improving 
overall operational efficiencies. In 201 1,  
the Group's AOSC programmes delivered 
$3.2 billion of benefits from the core 
businesses, excluding benefits from the 
Niobium and Phosphates businesses that 
were not core when targets were set 
($3.5 billion from the total Group). This 
represents the additional operating profit  
and capital expenditure savings realised in 
the year, over and above the performance 
expected had the programmes not been 
initiated. The above benefits are valued 
employing 201 1 commodity prices and 
exchange rates. The Committee further 
refined the target by determining that, for the 
201 1 award onwards, the effect of changes in 
both commodity prices and exchange rates 
should be stripped out of the AOSC targets 
and results so that only directly attributable 
management actions would be recognised.
Tying the AOSC measure directly to a 
meaningful portion of executives' incentive 
pay reflects the importance of the AOSC 
initiative in delivering increased value to 
shareholders, as evidenced by the very 
significant and stretching level of the targets. 
The adjudication of targets will be reviewed 
by internal audit and reported at the end of 
each performance period.
The proportion of shares vesting based on 
AOSC will vary according to the aggregate 
AOSC value delivered over the performance 
period. Unless a certain minimum value 
target is met, no shares will vest under this 
performance measure. The maximum  
AOSC target is based on a stretching level  
of value delivered.
The targets for the AOSC element of the 201 1 
conditional award, with the effect of changes 
in commodity prices and exchange rates 
stripped out, are shown in Figure 9.
The AOSC element of the award vests as 
shown in Figure 10.
Shares will vest on a straight-line basis for 
performance between the Minimum AOSC 
Target and the Maximum AOSC Target.
3.6 Vesting of share incentives in  
the event of change of control or 
termination of employment
In the event of a change of control of the 
Company, the following provisions apply 
under the Company's incentive plans: 
 The number of shares that vest under the 
LTIP will be calculated by reference to the 
extent to which the applicable performance 
conditions have been met at the time of the 
change of control.
 The Bonus Shares awarded under the  
BSP will be released and the Enhancement 
Shares awarded under the BSP will only 
vest to the extent that the performance 
condition has been met at the time of the 
change of control.
 Share options granted under the DOP or 
under the Company's legacy Executive 
Share Option Scheme (ESOS) may be 
exercised irrespective of whether the 
applicable performance conditions have 
been met.
 SAYE options may be exercised (to the 
extent of savings at the date of exercise).
 Participants in the SIP may direct the SIP 
trustee as to how to deal with their shares.
In the event that an executive director's 
employment is terminated, vesting of any 
outstanding share options under the DOP  
or under the ESOS is dependent upon the 
reasons for termination. Performance 
conditions fall away in the event of 
redundancy. However, if the director resigns 
voluntarily, then all such options lapse unless 
the Committee determines otherwise. 
In the case of LTIP awards, the Committee 
would normally exercise its discretion when  
an executive director's employment ceases 
as follows: if the director resigns voluntarily, 
then his/her interests lapse. If he/she retires 
with the consent of the Committee, is made 
redundant or is considered by the Committee 
to be a  good leaver', vesting on leaving is 
based on the normal performance criteria at 
the time of leaving and then pro rated for the 
proportion of the performance period for 
which the director served. 
In the case of the BSP , if an executive director 
ceases to be employed before the end of the 
year in respect of which the annual 
performance targets apply, then no award will 
be made unless the Committee determines 
otherwise (taking into account the proportion 
of the year for which the director was an 
employee of the Group and of performance 
to date against the annual performance 
targets at the date of cessation). If a director 
resigns voluntarily before the end of the 
three-year vesting period, the Bonus Shares 
lapse and awards of Enhancement Shares 
are forgone. If a director retires with the 
consent of the Committee, is made 
redundant or is considered by the Committee 
to be a  good leaver', Bonus Shares already 
awarded will be transferred as soon as 
practicable after the date of leaving. 
Enhancement Shares will vest only to the 
extent that the performance condition has 
been met and, if vesting is accelerated to the 
time of leaving, will be pro rated for the 
proportion of the performance period for 
which the director served.
3.7 Employee Share Ownership Trust 
and policy on provision of shares  
for incentive schemes
The Group has hitherto used an Employee 
Share Ownership Trust (the Trust) to acquire 
and hold shares for use in the operation of its 
share schemes. As at 31 December 201 1,  
the Trust held 985 ordinary shares in the 
Company, registered in the name of 
Greenwood Nominees Limited. Shares held 
by the Trust are not voted at the Company's 
general meetings. It is the Company's current 
policy to meet the requirements of share 
incentive schemes by using a mix of Treasury 
Shares, shares from the Trust or by market 
purchases, as appropriate. The Company 
also has the necessary authorities to utilise 
newly issued shares if required.
3.8 Pensions
Details of individual pension arrangements 
are set out on pages 1 12 and 1 15.
Prior to 6 April 201 1, executive directors (and 
UK employees more generally) had the 
option of all or part of their employer-funded 
defined-contribution pension contributions 
being paid into an unregistered retirement 
benefits scheme (an EFRBS). Since 6 April 
201 1, executive directors (and UK employees 
more generally) have the option of all or part 
of their employer-funded defined-
contribution pension contributions being 
treated as being paid to an unregistered 
unfunded retirement benefits scheme. 
Since the inception of the new UK pensions 
regime applicable from 6 April 2006, the 
Committee has been prepared to consider 
requests from executive directors (as is the 
case for London-based employees more 
generally) that their contracts be altered  
for future service, so that future pension 
benefits are reduced or cease to accrue  
and that a pension allowance be paid having 
the same value as the defined-contribution 
benefits forgone. 110 Anglo American plc  Annual Report 201 1
GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
Similarly, the Committee is prepared to 
consider requests from executive directors 
(as is the case for London-based employees 
more generally) that their contracts be 
altered for future service, so that 
supplementary pension contributions are 
made, or treated as being made, into their 
defined-contribution pension arrangements, 
in return for equivalent reductions in their 
future basic salaries and/or other elements  
of their remuneration.
3.9 Other benefits
Executive directors are entitled to the 
provision of a car allowance, medical 
insurance, death and disability insurance, 
social club membership and limited personal 
taxation/financial advice, in addition to 
reimbursement of reasonable business 
expenses. The provision of these benefits  
is considered to be market-competitive.
4.  EXECUTIVE SHAREHOLDING 
TARGETS 
Within five years of their appointment, 
executive directors are expected to acquire 
and maintain a holding of shares with a value 
of two times basic salary in the case of the 
chief executive and one and a half times basic 
salary in the case of any other executive 
director. At the date of this report these 
shareholding targets had been exceeded.
The Committee takes into consideration 
achievement against these targets when 
making grants under the Company's various 
long-term incentive plans.

5. EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
Executive directors are not permitted to hold 
external directorships or offices without the 
prior approval of the Board; if approved, they 
may each retain the fees payable from one 
such appointment. During the year ended 
31 December 201 1, Cynthia Carroll and  
Ren  M dori each retained fees amounting 
to  78,000 and  68,000 respectively.
6.  POLICY ON NON!EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTOR REMUNERATION
Non-executive director remuneration is 
approved by the Board as a whole on the 
recommendation of the chairman and 
executive directors.
The Company's policy on non-executive 
director remuneration is based on the 
following key principles: 
 Remuneration should be: 
 - sufficient to attract and retain world class 
non-executive talent
 - consistent with recognised best practice 
standards for non-executive director 
remuneration
 - in the form of cash fees, but with the 
flexibility to forgo all or part of such fees 
(after deduction of applicable income tax 
and social security contributions) to 
acquire shares in the Company should  
the non-executive director so wish
 - set by reference to the responsibilities 
taken on by the non-executives in chairing 
the Board and its Committees
 Non-executive directors may not participate 
in the Company's share incentive schemes 
or pension arrangements.
It is the intention that this policy will continue 
to apply for 2012 and subsequent years, 
subject to ongoing review as appropriate.
The Board reviews non-executive directors' 
fees periodically to ensure that they remain 
market-competitive. Additional fees are paid 
to the chairmen of Board Committees and to 
the senior independent director (SID). Should 
non-executive directors acquire executive 
board roles within subsidiaries of the 
Company, then they might also receive 
additional remuneration from the relevant 
subsidiaries on account of these increased 
responsibilities. Non-executive directors' 
fees were last reviewed in 2009 and were 
therefore again reviewed in December 201 1. 
It was decided that no increase would be 
made to the basic fees for a non-executive 
director, although the fees for committee 
chairmen and the SID would be increased 
with effect from January 2012 as follows:
 Chairmen of the Audit Committee, Safety 
and Sustainable Development Committee 
and Remuneration Committee to  25,000 
per annum.
 Chairman of the Nomination Committee to 
 12,500 per annum.
 Senior Independent Director to  25,000  
per annum.
These fees will next be reviewed in 
December 2013.
7. CHAIRMAN'S FEES
The chairman's fees are reviewed periodically 
(on a different cycle from the review of  
other non-executive directors' fees). 
A recommendation is then made to the  
Board (in the absence of the chairman) by  
the Committee and chief executive, who will 
take external advice on market comparators. 
The chairman's fees will be reviewed  
during 2012.
8. DIRECTORS' SERVICE CONTRACTS
Cynthia Carroll and Ren  M dori are 
employed by Anglo American Services (UK) 
Ltd (AAS).
It is the Company's policy that the period  
of notice for executive directors will not 
exceed 12 months and accordingly the 
employment contracts of the executive 
directors are terminable at 12 months'  
notice by either party. Should Cynthia Carroll 
not be required to work her full notice, AAS  
is able to discharge its liability for the 
unexpired portion of her notice period by 
making a payment in lieu of her salary and 
other contractual benefits; in the case of 
Ren  M dori, whose contract dates from 
2005, the payment would also include a 
pro-rated bonus.
The contracts of executive directors do not 
provide for any enhanced payments in the 
event of a change of control of the Company, 
nor for liquidated damages.
All non-executive directors have letters  
of appointment with the Company for an 
initial period of three years from their date  
of each appointment, subject to annual 
reappointment at the AGM as shown  
in Figure 12.
9.  H I S T O R I C AL COMPARATIVE TSR 
PERFORMANCE GRAPHS
The graphs shown in Figure 13 represent  
the comparative TSR performance of  
the Company from 1 January 2007 to  
31 December 201 1. In drawing up these 
graphs it has been assumed that all  
dividends paid have been reinvested.
The first graph shows the Company's 
performance against the performance  
of the FTSE 100 Index, chosen as being a  
broad equity market index which includes 
companies of a comparable size and 
complexity to Anglo American. This graph 
has been produced in accordance with the 
Large and Medium Sized Companies  
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008.
The second graph shows the Company's 
performance against the weighted Sector 
Index comparator group used to measure 
company performance for the purposes of 
the vesting of LTIP interests conditionally 
awarded in 2009. This graph gives an 
indication of how the Company is performing 
against the targets in place for LTIP interests 
already granted, although the specifics of  
the comparator companies for each year's 
interests may vary to reflect changes such  
as mergers and acquisitions among the 
Company's competitors or changes to the 
Company's business mix. TSR is calculated  
in US dollars, and the TSR level shown as at 
31 December each year is the average of the 
closing daily TSR levels for the five-day 
period up to and including that date. 11 2 Anglo American plc  Annual Report 201 1

10.1 Directors' emoluments 
Executive directors
Figure 14 sets out an analysis of the pre-tax 
remuneration during the years ended 
31 December 201 1 and 2010, including 
bonuses but excluding pensions,  
for individual directors who held office  
in the Company during the year ended 
31 December 201 1.
Non-executive directors
Figure 15 sets out the fees and other 
emoluments paid to non-executive directors 
during the year ended 31 December 201 1 
which amounted to  1,367,000  
(2010:  1,489,000).
10.2 Bonus Share Plan
Details of shares awarded under the BSP  
to executive directors during 201 1 and their 
current holdings are shown in Figure 16.
10.3 Long Term Incentive Plan 
Conditional awards of shares were made  
in 201 1 to executive directors under the  
LTIP as shown in Figure 17.
10.4 Directors' share options
No executive share options have been 
granted to any director since 2003. Options 
granted under SAYE are shown in Figure 18.
The highest and lowest mid-market prices  
of the Company's shares during the period 
1 January 201 1 to 31 December 201 1 were 
 34.37 and  21.39 respectively. The 
mid-market price of the Company's shares  
at 31 December 201 1 was  23.79.
10.5 Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
During the year, Cynthia Carroll and Ren  
M dori each purchased 53 shares under the 
SIP , in addition to the shares held by them at 
1 January 201 1. If these shares are held for 
three years, they will be matched by the 
Company on a one-for-one basis, conditional 
upon the director's continued employment. 
In addition, and in common with other 
participants in the SIP , Cynthia Carroll and 
Ren  M dori were each awarded 91 free 
shares under the SIP in March 201 1. 
Participants in the SIP are entitled to receive 
dividends on their shares. 
The information provided in sections 10.2  
to 10.5 is a summary. However, full details  
of directors' shareholdings and options are 
contained in the Register of Directors'

(1) 
The LTIP awards made in 2011 are conditional on two performance conditions as outlined on pages 107 to 109: the first is based on the Company's TSR relative to a weighted group of 
international mining companies and to the constituents of the FTSE 100; the second is based on the value delivered from AOSC initiatives during the medium term. Further details on the 
structure of the LTIP, the required level of performance for the 2011 award and how performance against targets is measured can be found on pages 107 to 109. The market price of the  
shares at the date of award was  31.99.
(2) 
The performance period applicable to each award is three years. The performance period relating to the LTIP awards in 2008 (which were granted on 17 March) ended on 31 December  
2010. Vesting was subject to two performance conditions: the first based on the Company's TSR relative to a weighted group of international mining companies and the FTSE 100; the  
second based on an underlying operating measure which focused on improvements in the Company's ROCE in the medium term. Part of each award was based on the TSR measure and  
part on the operating measure. Cynthia Carroll and Ren  M dori contractually agreed with AAS that supplementary pension contributions would be made in return for their surrendering the 
potential right to receive shares in the Company, pursuant to an award granted in 2008 under the LTIP. Had Cynthia Carroll and Ren  M dori not surrendered this right, vesting of the 2008 
LTIP would have been:

In
 
the case of the LTIP awards granted in 2008, the determinants for vesting were 50% on relative TSR and 50% on meeting specified Group ROCE targets. The ROCE targets are a function of 
targeted improvement in returns on existing capital employed at the start of the performance period and targeted returns in excess of the cost of capital on new capital investment over that 
period. The entry-level target for any LTIP has been the actual return achieved on the capital employed, excluding capital work in progress, in the year immediately preceding the commencement 
of the performance period. In order to maintain the effectiveness of the plan in driving long-term performance, the actual returns in the final performance year are adjusted for movements in 
commodity prices, certain foreign exchange rate effects (e.g. translation windfalls), capital in progress (to reflect the fact that mines under construction absorb large amounts of capital before 
producing a return), relevant changes in the composition of the Group (e.g. significant acquisitions and disposals) and other one-off factors which would otherwise result in a misleading outcome. 
The threshold blended target (i.e. the target on existing and new capital) for the performance period for the 2008 LTIP was 39.67% and the upper blended target 41.67%. The ROCE achieved was 
51.85% and the outcome on this element of the LTIP was thus 100%. On the TSR measure, Anglo American achieved a TSR over the three-year performance period of -17% which generated a nil 
vesting in terms of the 2008 Sector Index Comparator Group (against a median target of -2%) and a nil vesting against the FTSE 100 (being lower than the 50th percentile). The overall vesting 
level for those directors with a 50% Group ROCE, 25% Sectoral TSR and 25% FTSE 100 TSR split would therefore have been 50%.

In the case of the BSP awards granted in 2008, the determinant for the vesting of Enhancement Shares was real EPS growth, based on earnings per share growth against growth in the UK Retail Price 
Index (RPI) over the performance period. 44% of the Enhancement Shares would vest if EPS growth was RPI+9%, and 100% would vest if EPS growth was RPI+15%. As the EPS growth was below the 
threshold target over the period, the Enhancement Shares did not vest.
