 1.  INTRODUCTORY LETTER
Dear Shareholder,
It is the role of the Company's 
Remuneration Committee to ensure 
that the remuneration arrangements 
for executive directors and other 
members of the Executive Committee 
offer every encouragement to enhance 
the Company's performance and 
deliver our strategy - responsibly. 
We also need to ensure that the actual 
rewards received by the executive 
directors are proportionate to the 
levels of performance achieved 
and the returns received by you as 
shareholders. As a Committee, we 
therefore give full consideration to the 
Company's priorities, its performance, 
your interests and the interests of the 
wider communities we touch.
To help us clearly explain what our 
executive remuneration arrangements 
are and what rewards have been 
received over the past year and why, 
we have decided to adopt many of 
the changes being proposed by the 
UK Government to the reporting 
of directors' remuneration a year 
earlier than required. The contents 
of our new form of report are set out 
on the left and the new  Single Figure' 
is shown in Figure 13 on page 1 19.
As the chief executive reported in 
her introduction to this year's Annual 
Report, the current volatility in 
commodity prices is affecting the 
Company's short-term earnings but 
the Company continues to make 
progress towards sustainable growth 
over the mid to long-term. These 
challenges and successes are 
refl ected in the remuneration received 
by executive directors for 2012.
   The signifi cant drop in the 
Company's earnings in 2012 
means that no bonus was payable 
to executive directors in respect 
of earnings performance. The 
bonus amount that was earned 
refl ects management action taken 
in weak market conditions and the 
successful delivery of key strategic 
operational priorities.
   The drop in earnings also means 
that, of the Enhancement Shares 
initially awarded in 2010, none vested 
at the end of 2012, as the required 
three-year earnings growth was 
not achieved.
   The success over the last three years 
of the Company's longer-term 
effi ciency programmes means that 
around half the LTIP awards initially 
granted to executive directors in 
2010 are likely to vest. The other half 
will not vest as the full value of these 
savings have yet to be returned to you 
as shareholders in the form of 
superior TSR.
   With respect to 2012 there are 
two aspects of our remuneration 
arrangements that I would like to 
highlight:
   The Committee decided to 
remove the opportunity for 
executive directors to defer future 
additional amounts of bonus into 
shares and to receive 
correspondingly higher awards 
of Enhancement Shares; and
   The Chairman voluntarily waived 
the increase in his fee level that 
was due to take effect from August 
2012. There has, therefore, been 
no increase to his fees taken since 
joining the Company in 2009.

 GOVERNANCE  DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT Investors will be aware from the 
announcement on 8 January that 
Cynthia Carroll will step down from 
the Board at the Company's Annual 
General Meeting in April 2013 and 
will leave Anglo American at the end 
of that month. She will be succeeded 
as chief executive by Mark Cutifani 
whose appointment will take effect 
from 3 April 2013. The details of 
Mr Cutifani's remuneration package 
and Mrs Carroll's termination 
arrangements can be found on 
page 125 of this report.
With the advent of a new chief 
executive, the Committee intends 
to review the performance measures 
for the Company' s incentive plans 
during 2013, to ensure that they 
remain aligned with Company strategy 
and are suffi ciently stretching. We will 
of course consult with shareholders 
before making any changes.
We hope you fi nd the new form of 
report helpful and look forward to 
your feedback.

Remuneration levels are reviewed annually to ensure they 
remain competitive with reference to median levels in relevant 
FTSE 50 and global extractive companies
Basic salary To recruit 
and retain 
high-calibre 
executives
There is no prescribed maximum 
annual increase. The Committee 
is guided by the general increase 
for the broader UK employee 
population but on occasions may 
need to recognise, for example, 
development in role, change in 
responsibility, and/or specifi c 
retention issues
Basic salary levels are reviewed annually by the Committee, 
taking account of Company performance, individual 
performance, changes in responsibility and levels of increase 
for the broader UK population
Reference is also made to median levels within relevant 
FTSE 50 and global extractive companies, as 
mentioned above
The Committee considers the impact of any basic salary 
increase on the total remuneration package

   A performance-related share element, in the form of a 
conditional award of Bonus Shares made after the end of the 
relevant fi nancial year with a value equal to the cash element 
and vesting subject to a further three-year holding period
   An additional performance-related element, in the form of 
Enhancement Shares granted after the end of the fi nancial 
year to a face value of 75% of the Bonus Shares
The Committee reviews the BSP measures annually to ensure 
they remain appropriate
BSP targets are reviewed at the same time to ensure they are 
demanding yet realistic, given latest company strategy, prior 
performance, and external expectations
Dividends are payable on the Bonus Shares during the 
holding period
The Committee is able to claw back any unvested Bonus and 
Enhancement Shares in the event of a material misstatement 
in the Company's results

Executive directors participate in defi ned contribution 
pension arrangements
Prior to 6 April 201 1, executive directors had the option of 
all or part of their employer-funded defi ned contribution 
arrangements to be paid into an unregistered retirement 
benefi ts scheme (an EFRBS). Since 6 April 201 1, executive 
directors have the option for all or part of these contributions 
to be treated as if paid to an unregistered unfunded retirement 
benefi t scheme (an UURBS)
The Committee is prepared to consider requests from 
executive directors for a pension allowance to be paid in place

Not pre-determined For external appointments the Committee may offer 
additional cash and/or share-based elements when it 
considers these to be in the best interests of the Company 
(and therefore shareholders). Such payments would take 
account of remuneration relinquished when leaving the 
former employer and would refl ect the nature, time 
horizons and performance requirements attaching to that 
remuneration. Shareholders will be informed of any such 
payments at the time of appointment. The Company has 
retained its Discretionary Option Plan to use in such 
circumstances, if appropriate
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element 
awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay 
out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into 
account the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing 
remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may 
continue, provided that they are put to shareholders for 
approval at the earliest opportunity 
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may

as appropriate

The Committee will only make such an award if it is considered 
to be the most effective mitigation against such a risk and if it 
is deemed to be in the long-term interests of the Company 
(and shareholders) to do so
Any such awards would vest subject to continuing 
employment and could have performance conditions

Total pay for above target performance comprises basic salary, benefi ts, pension, 100% of maximum bonus 
opportunity (50% of which is deferred into Bonus Shares), a 0.75 for 1 match of Enhancement Shares (100% of 
maximum) and 100% of maximum LTIP opportunity. For this level of pay, three-year EPS growth would need to

2.2  Supplementary information
The Company has additional 
guidance for executive directors on 
shareholding targets and external and 
internal directorships.
Shareholding targets
Within fi ve years of appointment, 
executive directors are expected to 
hold Company shares with a value 
of two times basic salary for the 
chief executive and one and a half 
times basic salary for other executive 
directors. The Committee takes into 
consideration achievement against 
these targets when making grants 
under the Company's various 
long-term incentive plans.
External directorships
Executive directors are not permitted 
to hold external directorships or 
offi ces without the prior approval of 
the Board. If approved, they may each 
retain the fees payable from only one 
such appointment.
Internal directorships
Any fees earned through internal 
directorships must be ceded to 
the Company. 
In addition: 
   The remuneration provisions 
within the service contracts for 
Cynthia Carroll and Ren  M dori 
are consistent with the policy outlined 
in Figure 1 above and in Figure 4 
(termination provisions). 
   The remuneration arrangements 
for the executive directors outlined 
in Figure 1 are consistent with those 
for other executives serving on the 
Group Management Committee and 
the Executive Committee, although 
opportunity levels vary. 
   The performance conditions 
attaching to the longer-term incentive 
arrangements for executive directors 
were chosen to ensure alignment 
with the Company's strategic 
objective of operating effi ciency 
(AOSC - LTIP) and with the returns 
being delivered to shareholders 
(TSR - LTIP) or the funding of those 
returns (real EPS growth - BSP 
Enhancement Shares).
2.3 Indicative total 
remuneration levels
The Company's policy results in a 
signifi cant portion of remuneration 
received by executive directors being 
dependent on Company performance. 
Figure 3 illustrates how the total pay 
opportunities for the current chief 
executive and the fi nance director vary 
under three different performance 
scenarios: above, target and below. 
These charts are indicative as share 
price movement and dividend accrual 
have been excluded. All assumptions 
made are noted below the charts.
Governance
 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2012 11 3 2.4 Service agreements 
and termination
2.4.1 Executive directors
Cynthia Carroll and Ren  M dori are 
employed by Anglo American Services 
(UK) Ltd. The service agreements for 
both can be terminated at 12 months' 
notice by either party, in line with the 
Company's policy that the period of 
notice for executive directors should 
not exceed 12 months, except on 
appointment, when the Committee 
may agree an extended Company 
notice period only for the fi rst year 
following appointment.
Figure 4 sets out key provisions 
relating to termination of employment 
from the executive directors' service 
agreements and from the incentive 
plan rules. It also sets out key 
provisions relating to change of 
control, where there is no termination. 
There are no provisions for enhanced 
payments in the event of a change of 
control of the Company. 
2.4.2 Non-executive directors
All non-executive directors have 
letters of appointment with the 
Company for an initial period of 
three years, subject to annual 
re-appointment at the AGM. The 
Chairman's appointment may be 
terminated by the Company with 
six months' notice. The appointment 
letters for the Chairman and 
non-executive directors provide 
that no compensation is payable 
on termination, other than accrued 
fees and expenses.

and change of control

Salary and benefi ts
The period of notice for both executive directors is 12 months. Should Cynthia 
Carroll not be required to work her full notice, Anglo American Services is able 
to discharge its liability for the unexpired portion of her notice period by making 
a payment in lieu of her salary and other contractual benefi ts; in the case of 
Ren  M dori, whose contract dates from 2005, the payment would also include 
a pro-rated bonus
The contracts of executive directors do not provide for liquidated damages
Incentive plan 
provisions 
relating to 
termination 
Annual bonus
For the BSP , if an executive director ceases to be employed before the end 
of the year in respect of which the annual performance targets apply, then no 
award will be made unless the Committee determines otherwise (taking into 
account the proportion of the year for which the director was an employee of 
the Group and of performance to date against the annual performance targets 
at the date of cessation)
Bonus Shares and Enhancement Shares
If an executive director resigns voluntarily before the end of the three-year 
vesting period:
   Bonus Shares lapse
   Enhancement Share awards are foregone
If an executive director retires with the consent of the Committee, is made 
redundant or is considered by the Committee to be a Good Leaver:
   Bonus Shares already awarded will be transferred as soon as practicable 
after the date of leaving
   Enhancement Shares will vest only to the extent that the performance 
condition has been met and will be pro-rated for the proportion of the 
performance period for which the director served
LTIP awards
For outstanding LTIP awards, the Committee would normally exercise its 
discretion when an executive director's employment ceases as follows:
   If the director resigns voluntarily, then his/her interests lapse
   If he/she retires with the consent of the Committee, is made redundant or is 
considered by the Committee to be a Good Leaver, vesting is based on the 
normal performance criteria at the end of the normal performance period and 
then pro-rated for the proportion of the performance period for which the 
director has served
   The Committee retains fl exibility to accelerate the vesting of outstanding 
awards on termination. In such circumstances vesting is based on the normal 
performance criteria at the time of leaving and then pro-rated for the 
proportion of the performance period served

GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT 2.5 Development of 
director remuneration policy
In developing and reviewing the 
Company's remuneration policy 
for executive directors and other 
senior executives, the Committee is 
receptive to the views of shareholders 
and sensitive to the relationship 
between the arrangements for 
executive directors and those for 
other employee groups. 
Specifi cally:
   Whenever any signifi cant changes 
are made to remuneration, the 
Committee seeks feedback from 
investors. The Committee 
also listens to and takes into 
consideration investor views 
throughout the year. For example, 
following investor feedback, the 
Committee has decided, with effect 
from 2013, to withdraw the ability 
of executive directors and other 
executives to defer additional 
amounts of bonus into shares and 
receive correspondingly higher 
awards of Enhancement Shares; 
   The Committee considers the 
general basic salary increase 
for the broader UK employee 
population when determining the 
annual salary increases for the 
executive directors. For 2012 
and 2013, the rate of basic salary 
increase for the chief executive 
and the fi nance director has been 
the same as or lower than the 
general increase for the UK 
employee population (at 4% 
and 0% respectively); 
   Each year the Committee 
also reviews in detail how the 
arrangements for the executive 
directors compare to those for 
other members of the Group 
Management Committee and 
Executive Committee to ensure 
an appropriate relationship and 
to support career development 
and succession.

Given the geographic spread of 
the Company's workforce, the 
Committee does not consider that 
consulting with employees on the 
remuneration policy for directors is 
a viable use of resources. Many of 
the Company's UK-based employees 
are shareholders, through the SAYE 
and SIP schemes and they, like other 
shareholders, are able to express 
their views on director remuneration 
at each general meeting.

IN 2012
The information set out in this section 
has been subject to external audit.
3.1 Basic salary for 2012
In 2012 basic salary increases for 
the executive directors were limited 
to an infl ation adjustment in line with 
the increase for the broader UK 
employee population.
BSP KEY PERFORMANCE 
ASPECTS
   The weaker prices for the 
Company's main commodities 
impacted the executive directors' 
ability to deliver the target earnings; 
EPS performance was below the

GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT 3.3 BSP Enhancement 
Share outcomes for 2012 
In 2010 Cynthia Carroll and Ren  
M dori were awarded Enhancement 
Shares under the BSP . Vesting was 
subject to the Company's real EPS 
growth over the three-year period 
to 31 December 2012. The fall in 
commodity prices in 2012 - the fi nal 
year of the performance period - 
impacted the Company's EPS growth 
and as a consequence no shares 
will vest. 
BSP KEY PERFORMANCE 
ASPECTS
   The weaker prices for the 
Company's main commodities 
impacted the executive directors' 
ability to deliver the target earnings; 
EPS performance was below the 
required threshold level.
   Ren  M dori oversaw the 
issuance of corporate bonds with a 
US$ equivalent value of $5.1 billion 
in the US, European and South 
African markets increasing debt 
headroom and extending maturity. 
In addition, 99% of the Group's 
$1.7 billion convertible bonds were 
converted into equity, reducing net 
debt and interest.
   Anglo American's divestment 
programme, as set out in October 
2009, was successfully completed 
raising $4.0 billion of cumulative 
proceeds on a debt and cash 
free basis.
   Strong progress was achieved 
in the Supply Chain programme 
which drives sustained business 
improvement.
   Two major projects - Kolomela 
and Los Bronces - are due to reach 
full production on or ahead of 
schedule. Minas-Rio experienced 
a timetable delay and an increase 
in budget.
   Continued progress achieved in 
the drive for safety improvement.

SECTOR INDEX COMPARISON 
(25% OF TOTAL AWARD)
   The Sector Index measure 
compares the Company's 
three-year TSR performance 
with the weighted median of six 
international mining companies 
(94%) and four industrial mineral 
companies (6%).
   Vesting required the Company's 
TSR performance to be at least 
equal to the weighted median. 
   As at 31 December 2012 the 
Company's TSR performance 
was below the weighted median 
(at - 13%); it is therefore not 
expected that any shares will vest 
for this part of the award.
FTSE 100 COMPARISON 
(25% OF TOTAL AWARD)
   The FTSE 100 measure compares 
the Company's three-year TSR 
performance with the constituents 
of the FTSE 100.
   Vesting required the Company's 
TSR to be at least equal to the 
median TSR of the FTSE 100. 
   As at 31 December 2012 the 
Company's TSR performance 
was ranked below the 50th 
percentile of the FTSE 100; it is 
therefore expected that no shares 
for this part of the award will vest.
AOSC (50% OF TOTAL AWARD)
   The AOSC measure rewards 
the delivery of additional operating 
profi t and capital expenditure 
savings delivered through the 
Company's Asset Optimisation 
and Supply Chain programmes.
   Minimum vesting required 
cumulative savings to 31 December 
2012 of $5.13bn and maximum 
vesting required savings of 
$6.27bn.
   Actual performance was above the 
maximum target, leading to full 
vesting of this part of the award.
Figure 11: LTIP assessment for 2012
3.4 Long term incentive 
plan outcomes for 2012
In 2010 Cynthia Carroll and Ren  
M dori received LTIP grants with 
vesting subject to (a) the Company's 
TSR performance relative to (i) a 
weighted group of international 
mining companies and (ii) FTSE 100 
companies over the three-year 
period to announcement of the 2012 
results, and (b) the level of savings 
delivered by the Asset Optimisation 
and Supply Chain programmes to 
31 December 2012.
Figure 1 1 sets out further details of 
the measures, the Company's 
performance against each and the 
assumed outcomes for each executive 
director. As the performance period for 
the TSR measures ends immediately 
after the date of this report on the 
announcement of the 2012 results, 
performance and vesting in respect 
of the TSR measures is based on the

GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT LTIP KEY PERFORMANCE 
ASPECTS
   During 2012, the Company 
has continued to focus on 
infl uencing behaviours necessary 
for delivering AOSC benefi ts 
across businesses.
Operation reviews were 
performed at sites across 
Copper, Platinum, De Beers and 
Phosphates businesses to build 
on work done since 2010 to 
identify and prioritise business 
improvement opportunities.
Improved relationships with 
suppliers have resulted in 
minimised lead times for major 
equipment delivery and supply 
risk to our business.
Framework agreements are 
now in place with 38 of our key 
suppliers representing a formal 
alignment in our commercial 
relationship.
   As at 31 December 2012, the 
Company achieved a TSR over 
the 2010 LTIP performance 
period of - 13% which would 
generate a nil vesting in terms 
of the Sector Index (against a 
median target of 7%) and a nil 
vesting against the FTSE 100 
(being lower than the 50th 
percentile). 
The actual performance period 
for both TSR measures ends 
immediately after the date of 
this report. 
   If the 2010 LTIP awards vest 
at 50%, 43,791 shares are 
receivable by Cynthia Carroll 
and 27,520 by Ren  M dori. 
At a share price of  18.32 (the 
average for the last quarter of 
2012), this results in values 
of  802,251 and  504,166 
respectively.

   One quarter of the LTIP awards 
granted in 2012 vests according 
to the Company's three-year TSR 
performance compared with the 
TSR performance of the constituents 
of the FTSE 100 Index.
   The FTSE 100 performance 
targets and vesting schedule for 
the 2012 LTIP awards are outlined 
in Figure 18.
The performance targets for both 
TSR measures were calculated so 
that there is approximately a 15% 
chance of achieving full vesting 
and a 25% chance of three-quarters 
vesting. These probabilities were 
assessed by PwC using a Monte 
Carlo model.
Total shareholder return for both the 
TSR measures is calculated based 
on average returns over the fi ve 
working days immediately following 
announcement of the Company's 
annual results. It is assumed that all 
dividends are reinvested.

4.3.1 TSR - Sector Index 
comparison 
   One quarter of the LTIP awards 
granted in 2012 vests according to 
the Company's three-year TSR 
performance relative to a weighted 
basket of international mining 
companies (the Sector Index).
   The constituent companies of the 
Sector Index for the 2012 awards 
are shown in Figure 17a.
   The Committee may amend the 
list of comparator companies in 
the Sector Index, and relative 
weightings, if circumstances make 
this necessary (for example, as a 
result of takeovers or mergers 
of comparator companies or 
signifi cant changes in the 
composition of the Group).
   The Sector Index performance 
targets and the vesting schedule 
for the 2012 LTIP awards are 
summarised in Figure 17b. 
   Target performance for the 
Company requires the Company's 
three-year TSR to equal the 
weighted median TSR performance 
of the Sector Index. 
   Maximum vesting occurs when the 
Company's TSR outperforms the 
weighted median TSR of the Sector 
Index by 5% pa.

Governance
 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2012 121 4.3.3 Asset Optimisation 
and Supply Chain 
   Vesting of one half of LTIP awards 
granted in 2012 depends on the 
performance of the Company's 
strategic Asset Optimisation and 
Supply Chain (AOSC) programmes 
over the three-year period to 
31 December 2014. 
   These programmes strive to unlock 
value from the Company's assets 
in a sustainable way through 
structured Group-wide programmes 
aimed at reducing costs, increasing 
volumes and improving overall 
operational effi ciencies.
   The AOSC performance targets 
represent the operating and capital 
expenditure savings that the 
programme is yielding, compared 
with the savings made if the 
programme had not been 
implemented. These savings are 
realised cumulatively over the 
three-year performance period.
   For 201 1 LTIP awards onwards, 
the effect of changes in both 
commodity prices and exchange 
rates have been stripped out of the 
AOSC targets and results so that only 
directly attributable management 
actions are recognised.
   The AOSC targets and vesting 
schedule for the 2012 LTIP awards 
are shown in Figure 19.
   The Committee reviews the 
AOSC targets prior to each LTIP 
award to ensure they remain 
appropriately stretching and the 
benefi ts delivered are signifi cant 
to the Company. 
   At the end of each performance 
period, the assessment of 
performance against targets is 
reviewed by internal audit and 
reported to shareholders. 
   Figure 20 shows an example 
of AOSC improvements at 
Metallurgical Coal.
Figure 20: Asset Optimisation and Supply Chain
At our Metallurgical Coal Business 
Unit, we set out to focus on improving 
equipment performance which is 
driven by rate, availability and 
utilisation of our fl eet at open cut 
mines. Effective work area setup 
was the key to rate improvements, 
whilst utilisation improvements 
increase the productive time that 
equipment operates through 
reducing non-value adding activities. 
Benchmarking best practice 
equipment performance has 
supported identifi cation of the gaps 
and valuing the improvement. 
Improvements are  locked in' to the 
Operational Management System 
which defi nes the practices and 
processes by which our Metallurgical 
Coal sites operate, both from a mine 
planning perspective as well as an 
operational perspective. 
This approach was rolled out in 
Metallurgical Coal in 2008 and is 
delivering benefi ts.

(Figures are not subject to external audit)
By improving the rate, availability 
and utilisation of our equipment,more 
tonnes are moved for processing 
and ultimately available for sale to 
our customers. Our equipment 
performance benefi t is calculated 
on the improvement in controllable 
variables (which could be availability 
and/or utilisation and/or rate) against 
actual performance in the previous 
year, whilst all other variables are 
treated as uncontrollable and thus 
excluded from the benefi t calculation. 
The additional material moved is 
multiplied by the strip ratio to provide 
additional run of mine tonnes. The 
run of mine tonnes are multiplied by 
the yield achieved in the processing 
plant to deliver additional saleable 
production. Any incremental costs

124 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2012
GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT 5.  CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
ARRANGEMENTS
5.1 Appointment of new 
chief executive
Mark Cutifani's remuneration 
package will comprise a basic salary 
and variable incentive arrangements 
which are entirely in line with 
Anglo American's current 
remuneration policy and practice. 
The key elements of the package 
are as follows:
   Basic salary -  1.2m per annum.
   Bonus Share Plan (BSP) - 
Mr Cutifani will have the opportunity 
to participate in Anglo American's 
annual incentive arrangements (the 
BSP) for 2013 in line with the policy 
set out on page 1 10.
   Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) - 
Mr Cutifani will be eligible for an 
annual award under the LTIP in line 
with the policy set out on page 1 10.
   Compensation for incentives 
forfeited - Mr Cutifani will receive 
an award of restricted shares to 
compensate him for the loss of 
incentives from his previous 
employer AngloGold Ashanti (AGA). 
The Committee has decided that, 
so far as possible, the compensatory 
awards should be on a comparable 
basis to the foregone awards. As 
such, the Company commissioned 
a third-party valuation to determine 
the extent to which the performance 
conditions were, at the date of 
assessment, likely to be achieved.
Based on the AGA share price 
and exchange rates at the date of 
this report, the total value of the 
compensatory award is c.  2.29m; 
this fi gure will be updated at the 
time of Mr Cutifani's joining Anglo 
American, once the value of the 
shares foregone under the 2013 AGA 
Bonus Share Plan award (based on 
performance during 2012) is known, 
using the average share price and 
exchange rates over the week prior 
to that event.
In order to enhance alignment with 
the interests of Anglo American 
shareholders, the Committee has 
taken the decision to utilise Anglo 
American shares, rather than cash, 
as the medium for compensation. 
These restricted shares will vest over 
the next three years, in line with the 
vesting schedule of the incentives 
foregone. They will be subject to 
clawback in the event of Mr Cutifani's 
leaving the Company (except 
as a Good Leaver) or in the 
circumstances in which the 
Company's standard clawback 
provisions are triggered.
   Shareholding requirements - 
Mr Cutifani will be required to 
accumulate a shareholding in 
Anglo American to the value of 
two times basic salary within fi ve 
years of his appointment.
   Pension - Anglo American will make 
an annual contribution of 30% of 
basic salary in respect of Mr Cutifani's 
pension provision which may 
be invested into the Company's 
pension arrangements or taken 
as a cash allowance.
   Notice Period - The notice period in 
Mr Cutifani's service contract will be 
12 months for either party save that, 
should the Company serve notice 
before the fi rst anniversary of his 
appointment, it will be 18 months.
5.2 Termination arrangements 
for outgoing chief executive
In terms of her leaving arrangements, 
Cynthia Carroll will receive phased 
monthly payments, comprising basic 
salary and benefi ts, for the outstanding 
nine months of her notice period, in line 
with her contractual provisions. These 
payments will be subject to mitigation.
The Committee has determined that 
Cynthia Carroll will be eligible for 
consideration for a BSP award for 
2013 in respect of the period she will 
have served. However, there will be no 
award of Enhancement Shares or any 
award under the LTIP in 2013.
The Bonus Shares held by 
Cynthia Carroll will be released 
to her on termination.
With respect to the Enhancement 
Share and LTIP awards made in 
201 1 and 2012, the Committee has 
determined that these awards will vest 
on the normal vesting dates, to the 
extent that the performance conditions 
have been satisfi ed, and will be 
pro-rated for the proportion of 
each performance period served.
Full details of any amounts paid to 
Cynthia Carroll will be disclosed in the 
2013 Directors' Remuneration Report.

compliance with the Company's 
current disclosure obligations 
under the Large and Medium Sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts

7.1 Five-year relative TSR graphs
The top chart in Figure 27 shows the 
Company's TSR performance against 
the performance of the FTSE 100 
Index from 1 December 2008 to 
31 December 2012. The FTSE 100 
Index was chosen as being a broad 
equity market index which includes 
companies of a comparable size and 
complexity to Anglo American. 
The bottom chart in Figure 27 shows 
the Company's performance against 
a weighted Sector Index comparator 
group over the same fi ve-year period. 
The Sector Index comparator group 
is the same as used to measure the 
Company's performance for the 
purposes of the vesting of LTIP 
interests conditionally awarded in 
2010. This graph gives an indication 
of how the Company is performing 
against the targets in place for LTIP 
interests already granted, although the 
specifi cs of the comparator companies 
for each year's interests may vary to 
refl ect changes such as mergers and 
acquisitions among the Company's 
competitors or changes to the 
Company's business mix.
