DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT 
 
 
 
The Remuneration Committee comprises: 
 
A.H. Yadgaroff (Chairman) 
M.H. Atkinson 
J.G. Whellock 
 
The Remuneration Committee is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code.  
The members of the committee are all independent non-executive directors and the committee is chaired by 
A.H. Yadgaroff. 
 
The Policy and objectives 
 
The committee's policy is to attract, retain and motivate quality senior management with a competitive salary 
package. The principal components of the package are salary and performance related bonus awards for 
individuals annually at the discretion of the committee.  
 
The committee confirms that it complies with section 1 of the Combined Code in determining the Group's 
policy on remuneration of its executive directors, including service contracts and compensation. 
 
Executive directors' remuneration 
 
(i) Basic salary and benefits 
 Basic salaries and benefits in kind are reviewed within the policy on an annual basis. 
 
(ii) Share schemes 
 The Executive Share Option Scheme is an unapproved scheme and in accordance with its terms senior 
employees including executive directors, have received options at current market value to be exercised, 
in normal circumstances, between three and seven years after grant. 
 
(iii) Elements of remuneration 
 The components of remuneration are: 
 
 Salary - Fixed sum paid monthly. The committee reviews salaries annually in line with directors of 
comparable companies. 
 
 Pension - Executive directors are eligible to participate in the Executive Pension Scheme, described 
below. 
 
 Bonus - A scheme has been established which creates a bonus pool divisible between all executive 
directors in proportions to be determined by the Committee from time-to-time.  The Committee 
believes that it is fairest to all concerned for the scheme to be based on enhancement in shareholder 
value, measured by the Company's share price performance. 
 
 Share schemes - Executive directors are eligible to participate in all executive share schemes. 
 
(iv) Pension rights 
 The Company operates a Money Purchase Group Personal Pension Scheme which all employees and 
executive directors are eligible to join.  Pension scheme assets are held by Standard Life.  During the 
year 2 directors accrued benefits under the scheme. 
 
(v) Service contracts 
 Service contracts remain in force for P.M. Boycott, B.M. Wides and M.J. Tack.  It is the Company's 
policy that executive directors should have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a period of 
notice of twelve months.  In the event of early termination, the directors' contracts provide for 
compensation for this period.  The Board considers that this provision is appropriate in a competitive 
market place.
