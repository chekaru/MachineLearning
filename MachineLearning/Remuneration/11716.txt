The Remuneration Committee comprises: 
 
A.H. Yadgaroff (Chairman) 
M.H. Atkinson 
J.G. Whellock 
 
The Remuneration Committee is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code.  
The members of the committee are all independent non-executive directors and the committee is chaired by 
A.H. Yadgaroff. 
 
The Policy and objectives 
 
The committee's policy is to attract, retain and motivate quality senior management with a competitive salary 
package. The principal components of the package are salary and performance related bonus awards for 
individuals annually at the discretion of the committee.  In light of its latest review the committee decided to 
adjust the balance between salary and bonus to align it more closely with small company practice. 
 
The committee confirms that it complies with section 1 of the Combined Code in determining the Group's 
policy on remuneration of its executive directors, including service contracts and compensation. 
 
Executive directors' remuneration 
 
(i) Basic salary and benefits 
 Basic salaries and benefits in kind are reviewed within the policy on an annual basis.  There are no 
agreements between the Company and its directors resulting in compensation for loss of office or 
employment that may occur as a result of a takeover bid. 
 
(ii) Share schemes 
 The Executive Share Option Scheme is an unapproved scheme and in accordance with its terms senior 
employees including executive directors, have received options at current market value to be exercised, 
in normal circumstances, between three and seven years after grant. 
 
(iii) Elements of remuneration 
 The components of remuneration are: 
 
 Salary - Fixed sum paid monthly. The committee reviews salaries annually against those of directors of 
comparable companies. 
 
 Pension - Executive directors are eligible to participate in the Executive Pension Scheme, described 
below. 
 
 Bonus - A scheme has been established which creates a bonus pool divisible between all executive 
directors in proportions to be determined by the committee from time-to-time.  The committee believes 
that the scheme should be based on enhancement in shareholder value over the coming year, measured 
by the profit and asset growth as well as the Company's share price performance. 
 
 Share schemes - Executive directors are eligible to participate in all executive share schemes. 
 
(iv) Pension rights 
 The Company operates a Money Purchase Group Personal Pension Scheme which all employees and 
executive directors are eligible to join.  Pension scheme assets are held by Standard Life.  During the 
year, 1 director accrued benefits under the scheme.  Anglo Pacific Group PLC

(v) Service contracts 
 Service contracts remain in force for P.M. Boycott, B.M. Wides and M.J. Tack.  It is the Company's 
policy that executive directors should have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a period of 
notice of twelve months.  In the event of early termination, the directors' contracts provide for 
compensation for this period.  The Board considers that this provision is appropriate in a competitive 
market place.
