DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT 
 
 
 
22
 
The Remuneration Committee comprises: 
 
A.H. Yadgaroff (Chairman) 
M.H. Atkinson 
J.G. Whellock 
 
In accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code all the members of the Committee are 
independent non-executive directors.  The Committee is responsible for determining the Group's policy on 
remuneration of its executive directors, including service contracts and compensation in the event of early 
termination.  The Committee's full terms of reference are available on the Group's website. 
 
The fees of non-executive directors are determined by the Board having regard to the commitment of time 
required and the level of fees in similar companies.  Non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in 
the Company's bonus plan, share option schemes or pension scheme. 
 
The Group's non-executive directors are employed on rolling contracts with a 30 day notice period by either 
party. 
 
The Policy and objectives 
 
The Committee's policy is to attract, retain and motivate full-time high quality executive directors with a 
competitive salary package which comprises a fixed monthly basic salary and a significant performance-related 
bonus award that is strongly aligned with the interests of shareholders.  The Committee reviews the salary 
package annually having regard, amongst other factors, to the remuneration paid by companies of comparable 
size and business. 
 
It is the Committee's policy that executive directors should have service contracts with an indefinite term 
providing for a notice of twelve months.  Service contracts remain in force for P.M. Boycott, B.M. Wides, and 
M.J. Tack, who are all full-time employees of the Group. 
 
The committee confirms that it complies with section 1 of the Combined Code in determining the Group's 
policy on remuneration of its executive directors, including service contracts and compensation. 
 
Executive directors' remuneration 
 
(i) Basic salary 
 The basic salary component is low relative to that paid by comparator companies, and the Committee's 
aim is to achieve an appropriate balance between basic salary and performance-related pay which 
provides a strong incentive for high performance.  Executive directors' basic salaries have remained 
unchanged since July 2007. 
 
(ii) Performance-Related Bonus 
 A performance-related bonus scheme has been established which creates a pool divisible between all 
executive directors at the discretion of the Committee from time to time.  Half the bonus opportunity in 
2008 relates to the Group's share price performance, and half to profit and asset growth achieved 
during 2007; total bonus payable is capped at twice basic salary.  Of the total  490,000 bonus paid in 
2008,  390,000 was paid in April 2008 and  100,000 in October 2008. 
 
(iii) Share schemes 
 
 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme 
 
 No executive share options have been granted to directors since 1999 and no options are currently 
exercisable under the scheme, which is unapproved by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).

 The vesting period for the option scheme is either 3 or 5 years. In any event, if an option under the 
scheme remains unexercised after a period of 7 years from the date of grant, the option will lapse.  The 
exercise condition of the option scheme stipulates that the Group's Earnings per Share (EPS) must 
grow at a rate of 2% in excess of the UK Retail Price Index (RPI) over the vesting period if it is 3 years 
or 4% in excess of the RPI over the vesting period if it is 5 years. 
 
 The market price of the shares at 31
st
 December 2008 was 100p and the range during the year was 77p 
to 252p. 
 
 Approved Employee Share Option Plan 
 
 The Group operates a HMRC approved Company Share Option Plan.  No options were granted to 
directors during the year under this plan.

 There was no difference in the market price and the exercise price on the date the share options were 
granted. 
 
 The vesting period for the option plan is 3 years and, if an option remains unexercised after a period of 
10 years from the date of grant, the option will lapse.  The exercise condition of the option plan 
stipulates that the Group's Earnings per Share (EPS) must grow at a rate of 2% in excess of the UK 
Retail Price Index (RPI) over the vesting period.  No options were exercised during the year. 
 
(iv) Pension rights 
 The Company operates a Money Purchase Group Personal Pension Scheme which all employees and 
executive directors are eligible to join.  Pension scheme assets are held by Standard Life.  During the 
year the Group paid pension contributions in respect of M.J. Tack of  5,000 (2007:  4,125). 
 
(v) Early termination 
 In the event of early termination, the executive directors' service contracts provide for compensation 
limited to 12 month's basic salary.  There are no agreements between the Group and its directors 
resulting in compensation for loss of office or employment that may occur as a result of a takeover bid.  
The Board considers that this provision is appropriate in a competitive market place.
