DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT 
24
The Remuneration Committee comprises: 
A.H. Yadgaroff (Chairman) 
M.H. Atkinson 
J.G. Whellock 
In accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code all the members of the Committee are 
independent non-executive directors.  The Committee is responsible for determining the Group's policy on 
remuneration of its executive directors, including service contracts and compensation in the event of early 
termination.  The Committee's full terms of reference are available on the Group's website. 
The fees of non-executive directors are determined by the Board having regard to the commitment of time 
required and the level of fees in similar companies.  Non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in 
the Company's bonus plan, share option schemes or pension scheme. 
The Group's non-executive directors are employed on rolling contracts with a 30 day notice period by either 
party. 
The Policy and objectives 
The Committee's policy is to attract, retain and motivate full-time high quality executive directors with a 
competitive salary package which comprises a fixed monthly basic salary and a significant performance-related 
bonus award that is strongly aligned with the interests of shareholders.  The Committee reviews the salary 
package annually having regard, amongst other factors, to the remuneration paid by companies of comparable 
size and business. 
It is the Committee's policy that executive directors should have service contracts with an indefinite term 
providing for a notice period of six months.  Service contracts remain in force for all executive directors. 
The committee confirms that it complies with section 1 of the Combined Code in determining the Group's 
policy on remuneration of its executive directors, including service contracts and compensation. 
Executive directors' remuneration
(i) Basic salary 
 The basic salary component is low relative to that paid by companies of a similar size and nature, and 
the Committee's aim is to achieve an appropriate balance between basic salary and performance-related 
pay which provides a strong incentive for high performance. 
(ii) Performance-Related Bonus 
 A performance-related bonus scheme has been established which creates a pool divisible between all 
executive directors at the discretion of the Committee from time to time.  The Committee consider the 
performance of the directors against a number of criteria, including the movement in the Group's share 
price and the four main KPIs outlined on page 12. A proportion of this bonus is payable in shares to 
align the directors' interests with shareholders. 
(iii) Share schemes 
Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme 
 No executive share options have been granted to directors since 1999 and no options are currently 
exercisable under the scheme, which is unapproved by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).  Under the 
scheme rules no options may be granted after November 2007.  As a result this scheme has now closed.  Anglo Pacific Group PLC
