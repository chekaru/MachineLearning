The Remuneration Committee comprises:
A.H. Yadgaroff (Chairman)
M.H. Atkinson
J.G. Whellock
All the members of the Remuneration Committee are non-executive 
directors and are considered to be independent.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the 
Group's policy on remuneration of its executive directors, including 
service contracts and compensation in the event of early termination. 
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available 
on the Group's website at www.anglopacificgroup.com.
Advice to the Remuneration Committee
During the year, Kepler Associates were appointed by the 
Remuneration Committee to provide advice that materially assisted 
the Remuneration Committee. Kepler Associates provided no other 
services to the Group.
The policy and objectives
The Remuneration Committee's policy is to attract, retain and 
motivate full-time high quality executive directors with a competitive 
salary package which comprises a fixed monthly basic salary and a 
significant performance-related bonus award that is strongly aligned 
with the interests of shareholders.
In determining remuneration, consideration will be given to reward 
levels throughout the Group as well as in the external employment 
market. The remuneration committee aim to reward all employees 
fairly based on their role, their performance and salary levels in the 
wider market.
Executive directors' remuneration
(i) Basic salary
  The basic salary component is low relative to that paid by 
companies of a similar size and nature, and the Committee's aim 
over time is to achieve an appropriate balance between basic 
salary and performance-related pay which provides a strong 
incentive for high performance.
(ii) Performance-Related Bonus
  A performance-related bonus scheme has been established which 
creates a pool divisible between all executive directors at the 
discretion of the Committee from time to time. The Committee 
consider the performance of the directors against a number of 
criteria, including the movement in the Group's share price and the 
four main key performance indicators outlined on  page 12.  
A proportion of this bonus is payable in shares to align the 
directors' interests with shareholders.
(iii) Share schemes
 Company Share Option Plan
  The Group operates a HMRC approved Company Share Option 
Plan (the CSOP ).
  The options of the directors at December 31, 2010 under the CSOP 
were as undernoted for which nil has been paid.

  There was no difference in the market price and the exercise price 
on the date the share options were granted.
  The vesting period for the option plan is three years and, if an 
option remains unexercised after a period of 10 years from the 
date of grant, the option will lapse. The exercise condition of the 
option plan stipulates that the Group's Earnings per Share (EPS) 
must grow at a rate of 3% in excess of the UK Retail Price Index 
(RPI) over the vesting period.
  The market price of the shares at December 31, 2010 was 360p 
and the range during the year was 223p to 360p.
  The market price when Mr M.J. Tack exercised his share options 
was 251.5p.
 Joint Share Ownership Plan 
  Under the Company's Joint Share Ownership Plan (the JSOP ), 
the Remuneration Committee invites selected employees to enter 
into an agreement with the Anglo Pacific Group Employee Benefit 
Trust (the Co-owner ) to acquire a number of ordinary shares in 
the capital of the Company. The shares are held in the name of the 
Co-owner; however, the selected employees maintain a beneficial 
interest in these shares.
  The beneficial interests of the directors at December 31, 2010 
under the JSOP were as undernoted for which nil has been paid. 22 Governance

  Awards under the JSOP are conditional on the employee 
completing three years' service (the vesting period) and the 
Group's absolute total shareholder return growing at an annual 
rate (not compounded) of 3% in excess of the UK Retail Price 
Index over the three year vesting period. In addition the Company's 
share price must reach a hurdle price during the three year vesting 
period as determined by the Remuneration Committee at the time 
of making the award.
  Upon satisfying the performance targets and service requirements, 
the beneficial interest conferred will entitle the employee to 
receive a proportion of the proceeds of sale of the ordinary shares. 
Their entitlement will be to receive the equivalent of all sales 
proceeds in excess of the threshold amount, settled in ordinary 
shares of the Company. The threshold amount is fixed by the 
Remuneration Committee and will not be set less than the market 
value of the ordinary shares of the Company, at the time the JSOP 
award is made.
(iv) Pension rights
  The Company operates a Money Purchase Group Personal Pension 
Scheme which all employees and executive directors are eligible to 
join. Pension scheme assets are held by Standard Life. During the 
year the Group paid pension contributions in respect of directors 
as follows:
2010
 
2009
 
A.C. Orchard 10,500 3,500
M.J. Tack 10,500 5,583
J. Theobald 8,000 3,500
(v) Early termination
  In the event of early termination, the executive directors' service 
contracts provide for compensation of payment in lieu of notice 
plus a termination payment equivalent to six months' basic salary. 
There are no agreements between the Group and its directors 
resulting in compensation for loss of office or employment that 
may occur as a result of a takeover bid. The Board considers that 
this provision is appropriate in a competitive market place.
Non-executive directors' remuneration
The fees of non-executive directors are determined by the Board 
having regard to the commitment of time required and the level of 
fees in similar companies. Non-executive directors are not eligible 
to participate in the Company's bonus plan, share option schemes or 
pension scheme.
External appointments
It remains the Group's policy that all earnings from non-executive 
directorships held by the Group's executive directors be retained by 
the Group. 
Directors' service contracts
It is the Group's policy that executive directors' service contracts have 
a notice period of not more than one year.
The Group's non executive directors are employed on rolling contracts 
with a 30 day notice period by either party.
The details of the service contracts of the directors in office at 
December 31, 2010 are as follows:
