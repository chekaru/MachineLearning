Directors' remuneration report
The components of the package are set out below.
Executive directors' remuneration
(i) Basic salary
  The basic salary component is low relative to that paid by  
FTSE 250 companies of a similar size and nature, and the 
Remuneration Committee's aim over time is to continue steadily 
to narrow the gap with the lower quartile of basic salaries paid  
by such companies.
(ii) Annual incentive award
  The Group continues to operate an annual performance-related 
incentive plan, which creates a pool divisible between all executive 
directors at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee 
from time to time. The maximum award payable is capped at 
150% of basic salary. The Remuneration Committee considers 
the performance of the executive directors against a number of 
criteria, including the movement in the Company's share price, 
the acquisition of new royalties, and the other three main key 
performance indicators outlined on  page 14.  
A proportion of this award is normally payable in shares.
(iii) Share schemes
  The Group operates two share schemes: an HMRC-approved 
Company Share Option Plan (the CSOP ) and a Joint Share 
Ownership Plan (the JSOP ).
 Company Share Option Plan
  The CSOP is open to certain employees and directors of the 
Company, as selected by the Board at its absolute discretion. 
The CSOP was approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting held on April 21, 2010.
  Share options are granted at the prevailing market price on the 
date of grant. The vesting period for the option plan is three 
years and, if an option remains unexercised after a period of 10 
years from the date of grant, the option will lapse. The exercise 
condition of the option plan stipulates that the Group's absolute 
total shareholder return must grow at a rate of 3% per annum 
(not compounded) in excess of the UK Retail Price Index over the 
vesting period.
  The market price of the shares at December 31, 2011 was 276p 
and the range during the year was 226p to 369p.
  The table below shows, for the directors who served during the 
year, the options outstanding at December 31, 2011 for which nil 
has been paid.

  In accordance with the rules of the CSOP, all of Mr M.J. Tack's 
outstanding options were forfeited following his resignation on 
September 23, 2011.
 Joint Share Ownership Plan 
  Under the JSOP, the Remuneration Committee invites selected 
employees and directors to enter into an agreement with the 
Anglo Pacific Group Employee Benefit Trust (the Co-owner ) to 
acquire a number of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company. 
The shares are held in the name of the Co-owner; however, the 
selected employees maintain a beneficial interest in these shares. 
The JSOP was approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting held on April 21, 2010.
  Awards under the JSOP are conditional on the employee 
completing three years' service (the vesting period) and the 
Group's absolute total shareholder return growing at an annual 
rate (not compounded) of 3% in excess of the UK Retail Price 
Index over the three year vesting period. In addition, the 
Company's share price must reach a hurdle price during the 
three year vesting period as determined by the Remuneration 
Committee at the time of making the award.
  Upon satisfying the performance targets and service requirements, 
the beneficial interest conferred will entitle the employee to 
receive a proportion of the proceeds of sale of the ordinary shares. 
Their entitlement will be to receive the equivalent of all sales 
proceeds in excess of the threshold amount, settled in ordinary 
shares of the Company. The threshold amount is fixed by the 
Remuneration Committee and will not be set less than the market 
value of the ordinary shares of the Company at the time the JSOP 
award is made.
  The JSOP awards are limited in value such that the initial value of 
shares acquired jointly with the Co-owner under the award will not 
exceed 400% of the employee's gross annual salary. In the first 
year of the JSOP (2010), the Board (on the recommendation of the 
Remuneration Committee), awarded shares equivalent to 350% 
of basic salary to Mr A.C. Orchard, Mr M.J. Tack and Mr J. Theobald; 
and in 2011, a further award of 175% of basic salary was made to 
each of these individuals. 24 Governance

(iv) Pension rights

 1 Mr M.J. Tack resigned as a director on September 23, 2011. 
Executive directors' service contracts
Although all of the executive directors' service contracts are for an 
indefinite term, it is the Group's policy that the service contracts 
do not have a notice period of more than one year. In the event of 
termination, the service contracts allow the Company to make a 
payment in lieu of notice. The service contracts of Mr J. Theobald and 
Mr A.C. Orchard also provide for an additional termination payment 
equivalent to six months' basic salary, whereas the service contracts 
of Mr P.M. Boycott and Mr B.M. Wides simply limit payment for loss 
of office to twelve months' basic salary. The service contracts provide 
that any such payments will be without prejudice to the director's  
duty to mitigate his loss. No executive director has provisions in his 
service contract that relate to a change of control of the Company.  
The details of the service contracts of the executive directors in office 
at December 31, 2011 are as follows:
Contract date Notice period
Executive directors
P.M. Boycott November 1, 2010 6 months
A.C. Orchard March 26, 2010 6 months
J. Theobald March 26, 2010 6 months
B.M. Wides October 1, 2010 6 months
Non-executive directors' terms of appointment
The Group's non-executive directors have letters of appointment 
for an indefinite term, although they may be terminated by either 
party subject to 30 days' notice. None of the letters have provisions 
that relate to a change of control of the Company. The fees of non-
executive directors are determined by the Board having regard to 
the commitment of time required and the level of fees in similar 
companies. Non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in 
the Company's annual performance-related incentive award, share 
option schemes or pension scheme. The details of the non-executive 
directors' letters of appointment in office at December 31, 2011 are  
as follows:

the Group.  Governance
