Anglo Pacific Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Directors' remuneration report
During the whole of 2012, the Remuneration Committee comprised 
Mr. Atkinson, Dr. Whellock and Mr. Yadgaroff, who was also the 
Chairman of the Committee. Following Mr. Blyth's appointment to 
the Board on March 20, 2013, the Committee is currently comprised 
of Mr. Blyth and Mr. Atkinson who is now the Chairman of the 
Committee. The Remuneration Committee held two meeting during 
the year.
The Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the 
Board on the Company's framework for executive remuneration and 
its cost. The Committee determines the contract terms, remuneration 
and other benefits for each of the Executive Directors (including the 
Chairman), including performance related bonus schemes, pension 
rights and compensation payments. It has access to the advice of 
independent remuneration consultants when required. The Board itself 
determines the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors.  
No director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
Policy
There are three important elements that impact on the Committee's 
policy. The Group has:
 a high market capitalisation ( 296m at December 2012) relative to 
the size of its management team (staff total: eleven, four of whom 
are Executive Directors);
 long investment horizons (typically there can be an interval of 
between two and ten years before a royalty comes on stream and 
the royalty may continue to flow for twenty years or more);
 no comparable peer group, certainly in the UK, for the purposes of 
benchmarking director performance. 
As with any  people' business the loss of key executives could be 
seriously disruptive. The Committee has accordingly taken the 
retention of Executive Directors as a key objective of its remuneration 
policy, alongside incentivising their performance in acquiring new 
royalties. Other objectives include a strong alignment of directors' 
interests with those of shareholders, and a remuneration level  
and structure that relates sensibly to the pay and bonuses of  
non-Board employees.
Over the last two to three years, the Committee has pursued a 
consistent and coherent policy for delivering these objectives. As 
discussed more fully below, the main elements of the remuneration 
package are:
 a fixed monthly basic salary;
 an annual performance-relate bonus; and
 longer-term share schemes, particularly a Joint Share Ownership  
Plan (JSOP).
Basic Salary
Given the relative simplicity of the Group's business model, the 
Committee has taken as its benchmark the lower quartile of basic 
salaries paid by FTSE companies of similar market capitalisation and 
nature. The basic salaries paid by the Group have been well below this 
level. Over the last three years, the Committee's policy has been to 
increase the basic salaries of full-time Executive Directors by  20,000-
25,000 per annum in order to narrow this gap, which nevertheless 
remains significant (it would require an additional increase in the 
Chief Investment Officer's salary of approximately 23% to match the 
lower quartile of operational heads and of 78% in the Chief Executive 
Officer's salary to match that of the top full time executive).  
Mr. B.M. Wides receives fees in lieu of salary. 
The Committee's policy in 2013 - and, most likely, 2014 - is to 
continue to steadily raise the basic salaries towards the lower quartile 
of FTSE companies of comparable size and nature, with further 
increases of  20,000-25,000 in each year for full-time Executive 
Directors and pro rata for part-time Executive Directors. This is 
considered to be important for both retention and for attracting new 
Executive Directors and senior managers in the future. 
Annual Bonus
The Committee views the annual bonus as the primary means  
for incentivising the performance of the Executive Directors.  
Annual bonus is capped at 150% of basic salary. Awards over the 
last three years have been assessed principally by reference to the 
performance achieved against the Key Performance Indicators set  
out on  page 17, i.e.:
 value of new royalties achieved;
 operating profit; and
 dividends per share.
Other factors including adjusted net asset value are also taken into 
account. Where a new royalty that has been recognised in a bonus 
award subsequently fails to come into production, the bonus paid in 
the year the royalty fails will be reduced. Significant and successful 
corporate activity may also be recognised through a bonus award.  
A significant increase in the company's share price during the year, 
while it will not on its own trigger a bonus, may nevertheless amplify 
the level of bonus awarded; conversely, a significant decrease in the 
share price may constrain the level of bonus awarded. The Group's 
policy is that at least 25% of any annual bonus award will normally be 
in the form of shares.
It is proposed to retain the annual bonus offer for 2013 on the same 
basis. The threshold for bonus in respect of the aggregate value of 
royalty acquisitions remains at $40m.
Longer-Term Share Schemes 
The Group operates two share schemes for Executive Directors and 
certain employees: a Company Share Option Scheme (CSOP ) and a 
Joint Share Ownership Plan (JSOP ). Both schemes were introduced in 
2010, with three purposes. 
Their primary purpose was to incentivise retention of key personnel: 
awards under both schemes are dependent on the employee 
completing three years' service following the grant of the options (the 
vesting period). Secondly, the Committee believes that a substantial 
shareholding in the Group helps provide assurance that the interests of 
directors and key employees will be firmly aligned with shareholders. 
Thirdly, the schemes incentivise longer-term performance. Under 
both schemes, awards are conditional upon the Group's absolute total 
shareholder return growing at an annual rate (not compounded) of 
3% in excess of the UK Retail Price Index over the three year vesting 
period, and, in the case of the JSOP, also upon the Group's share price 
reaching a hurdle level during the vesting period, as determined by the 
Committee at the time the option is granted.
The Committee believes that the current shareholdings of Executive 
Directors, together with the share options available under the JSOP, 
are now sufficient to assure the alignment of their interests with those 
of shareholders. No further awards to existing Directors under the 
JSOP are accordingly envisaged during 2013, although awards may still 
be made to any new Executive Directors appointed during the year. 
Previous initial awards of JSOP have been substantial (up to 350% of 
basic salary), falling steadily in subsequent years, and this pattern is 
expected to be followed in the future. Aside from the usual restrictions 
on share dealings, the shares awarded to Directors are not subject to  Governance Anglo Pacific Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
29
Directors' remuneration report
any additional specific restrictions on sale. However, the Committee 
has indicated that disposals would make further awards to that 
Director unlikely. 
Company Share Option Plan
Share options are granted at the prevailing market price on the date 
of grant. The vesting period for the option plan is three years and, if an 
option remains unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of 
grant, the option will lapse. The exercise condition of the option plan 
stipulates that the Group's absolute total shareholder return must 
grow at a rate of 3% per annum (not compounded) in excess of the UK 
Retail Price Index over the vesting period.
Joint Share Ownership
Under the JSOP, the Remuneration Committee invites selected 
employees and Directors to enter into an agreement with the Anglo 
Pacific Group Employee Benefit Trust (the Co-owner ) to acquire 
a number of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company. The 
shares are held in the name of the Co-owner; however, the selected 
employees maintain a beneficial interest in these shares. The JSOP  
was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on  
April 21, 2010. 
Awards under the JSOP are conditional on the employee completing 
three years' service (the vesting period) and the Group's absolute total 
shareholder return growing at an annual rate (not compounded) of 
3% in excess of the UK Retail Price Index over the three year vesting 
period. In addition, the Company's share price must reach a hurdle 
price during the three year vesting period as determined by the 
Remuneration Committee at the time of making the award. 
Upon satisfying the performance targets and service requirements, 
the beneficial interest conferred will entitle the employee to receive 
a proportion of the proceeds of sale of the ordinary shares. Their 
entitlement will be to receive the equivalent of all sales proceeds 
in excess of the threshold amount, settled in ordinary shares of 
the Company. The threshold amount is fixed by the Remuneration 
Committee and will not be set less than the market value of the 
ordinary shares of the Company at the time the JSOP award is made. 
The JSOP awards are limited in value such that the initial value of 
shares acquired jointly with the Co-owner under the award will not 
exceed 400% of the employee's gross annual salary. 
During the vesting period, the Co-owner and the employee have 
agreed to limit the exercise of their voting rights to matters concerning 
alterations to the Articles of Association of the Company that could 
adversely affect the employee's rights under the JSOP, and to waive 
their rights to dividends.
The Committee continues to review the scope for an alternative long-
term incentive plan designed to offer graduated rewards for increasing 
levels of long-term performance; but, as noted in last year's Report, 
the long investment horizons and the absence of comparable royalty 
companies in the UK make this difficult.
Pension rights
The Company makes contributions to employees' pensions and has 
designated AEGON Scottish Equitable PLC as its stakeholder pension 
provider. The Committee is prepared to pay additional basic salary (or 
fees) in lieu of part or all of a director's pension contribution.
Executive Directors' service contracts
Although all of the Executive Directors' service contracts are for an 
indefinite term, it is the Group's policy that the service contracts 
do not have a notice period of more than one year. In the event of 
termination, the service contracts allow the Company to make a 
payment in lieu of notice. The service contracts of Mr J. Theobald and 
Mr A.C. Orchard also provide for an additional termination payment 
equivalent to six months' basic salary, whereas the service contracts 
of Mr P.M. Boycott and Mr B.M. Wides simply limit payment for loss 
of office to twelve months' basic salary. The service contracts provide 
that any such payments will be without prejudice to the director's 
duty to mitigate his loss. No executive director has provisions in his 
service contract that relate to a change of control of the Company.  
The details of the service contracts of the Executive Directors in office 
at December 31, 2012 are as follows:
Contract 
date

period
Executive Directors
P.M. Boycott November 1, 2010 6 months
A.C. Orchard March 26, 2010 6 months
J. Theobald March 26, 2010 6 months
B.M. Wides October 1, 2010 6 months
Non-Executive Directors
Other than Mr. W.M. Blyth and Mr. P.N.R. Cooke, the Group's Non-
Executive Directors have letters of appointment for an indefinite term, 
although they may be terminated by either party subject to 30 days' 
notice. Mr. Blyth and Mr. Cooke were appointed on rolling three-year 
contracts with a one month notice period and the Board intends that all 
future Non-Executive Director appointments will be on similar terms. 
None of the letters have provisions that relate to a change of control of 
the Company. The fees of Non-Executive Directors are determined by 
the Board and reviewed bi-annually having regard to the commitment 
of time required and the level of fees in similar companies. Additional 
amounts are awarded to reflect the increased commitment required 
for members and chairpersons of the various Board committees 
and associated with the role of Senior Independent Director. Non-
Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the Company's 
annual performance-related incentive award, share option schemes or 
pension scheme. The details of the Non-Executive Directors' letters of 
appointment in office at December 31, 2012 are as follows:

J.G. Whellock May 19, 2003 30 days
A.H. Yadgaroff May 19, 2003 30 days
External Appointments
It remains the Group's policy that all earnings from Non-Executive 
Directorships held by the Group's Executive Directors be retained by 
the Group.
Implementation
(i) Basic Salary
The basic salaries of the Executive Directors were last increased in 
December 2011. Despite a recommendation from the Committee 
that the salary increases continue in line with its policy, the Board 
concluded that no further increase should be made until at least 
Spring 2013. This would allow the Group additional time to canvass 
shareholder views on the Group's broader remuneration policy.

(ii) Annual Bonus
In 2010, bonus awards were around 100% of basic salaries, and in 2011 
around 55%. For 2012, the Committee agreed that the award of bonus 
would be primarily dependent on the acquisition of $40m of new 
royalties. The value of new royalties acquired during the year fell short 
of this. As regards the other key performance indicators, although 
dividends per share rose, operating profit - and to a lesser extent net 
asset value - fell. The Committee accordingly concluded that no bonus 
should be paid in respect of 2012.
(iii) Longer-Term Share Schemes
The market price of the shares at December 31, 2012 was 269.75p and 
the range during the year was 220p to 345p.
Company Share Option Plan
In 2010, share options were granted under the CSOP to Mr. A.C. 
Orchard and Mr. J. Theobald up to the cumulative limit allowable 
under HMRC rules, and no Executive Director has received further 
CSOP options since then.

Joint Share Ownership Plan
In the first year of the JSOP (2010), the Board (on the recommendation 
of the Remuneration Committee), awarded share equivalent to 350% 
of basic salary to Mr A.C. Orchard and Mr J. Theobald; an award of 
175% of basic salary was made in 2011 to each of these individuals and 
in 2012, a further award of 87.50% of basic salary was made to each of 
these individuals.

Non-Executive Directors
During the year, the Board conducted its bi-annual review of the Non-
Executive Directors' fees and agreed to increase them to  38,000 a 
year commencing January 1, 2013. It was further agreed to pay  
Mr. M. Atkinson an additional  4,000 a year, in order to reflect his 
additional duties as Senior Independent Director. Mr. W.M. Blyth 
receives  38,000 a year, whereas Mr. P.N.R. Cooke receives  36,000 
a year - a lesser amount to reflect that he is neither a member, nor a 
chair person of any of the Board committees. Governance
