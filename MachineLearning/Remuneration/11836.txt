 Directors' remuneration report
Dear Shareholder,
Our remuneration report is, as last year, in two parts: a statement 
of the Company's policy on Directors' remuneration, and an 
Annual Remuneration Report which describes how the policy 
was implemented in 2013. What is different this year is that, in 
accordance with new regulations governing the disclosure and 
approval of directors' remuneration, the Policy Report is being 
put to a binding shareholder resolution at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting ( AGM') and the Annual Remuneration Report 
will be subject to an advisory shareholder resolution.
There have been significant changes in our remuneration 
strategy over the last few months, and I thought it might be 
helpful to briefly explain the background and put the changes  
in context. 
All four Executive Directors in post at the last AGM have either 
left the Board or will be doing so at the forthcoming AGM. In 
October 2013, we recruited in their place a strong team of two 
Executive Directors, Mr. Treger as CEO, and Mr. Potter, as CIO 
with a venture capital background and a mission to reinvigorate 
the Company and achieve a significant increase in total 
shareholder return over the next five years.
The basic salaries paid to the previous Directors were well below 
those in companies of comparable size, but this was offset by  
a relatively high annual bonus opportunity of 150% of salary.  
To recruit the new Directors we needed to offer basic salaries  
in line with market rates. Their annual bonuses have, however, 
been capped at 100%, the bonus criteria are being made more 
specific, and the increases in basic salary for the following two 
years have been pre-determined.
The major change, however, is a five year Long-Term Incentive 
Plan ( LTIP') in the form of a Value Creation Plan ( VCP') which 
will offer awards of shares (in the form of nil cost share options) 
at the end of five years to the two Executive Directors (and to  
a lesser extent to other senior managers) for increases in Total 
Shareholder Return ( TSR') at rates above 7% per annum. 
Shareholder approval for the VCP will be sought at our 
forthcoming AGM and will replace the previous Joint Share 
Option Plan (  JSOP'), which has not rewarded outperformance.
The VCP offers potentially significant rewards for 
outperformance, but only to the extent of the increase in TSR 
actually achieved over the five year period. The Remuneration 
Committee has worked hard with our remuneration advisers, 
New Bridge Street ( NBS'), to ensure that the Plan supports the 
ambitious growth strategy discussed earlier in the Annual Report, 
and we believe that the incentives offered are strongly aligned 
with shareholder interests.
I accordingly hope you will feel able to support our new 
remuneration policy at this year's forthcoming AGM, as well  
as endorsing the level of remuneration paid during 2013.
Yours sincerely
M.H. Atkinson 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
March 27 , 2014
 
Introduction
The Remuneration Committee (the  Committee') determines, on 
behalf of the Board, the Company's policy on the remuneration of 
the Chairman and the Executive Directors. It also recommends 
and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for other 
senior executives. The Committee's terms of reference are 
available on the Company's website.
Membership of the Remuneration Committee
Membership of the Committee during 2013 is set out in the table 
below, together with the attendance record for meetings of the 
Committee. Since March 2013, all of the Committee's members 
have been independent Non-Executive Directors, in accordance 
with the Corporate Governance Code.

Following Mr. Stan's appointment to the Board on February 19, 
2014, the Remuneration Committee is now comprised of 
Mr. Atkinson, Mr. Blyth and Mr. Stan.
External advisors
The Committee has access to the advice of independent 
remuneration consultants when required. No such consultants 
were used during 2013. However, during 2014, the Committee 
has received advice from NBS. NBS was appointed by the 
Committee on January 20, 2014. NBS is a signatory to the 
Remuneration Consultants' Code of Conduct and has no other 
connection with the Company. The Committee is satisfied that 
the advice that it receives from NBS is objective and 
independent.
The remuneration report is in two parts. 
The first part constitutes the  Remuneration Policy Report' and 
sets out the remuneration strategy that the Company proposes 
to apply for 2014 onwards. It has been developed taking into 
account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
2012 and the views of our major shareholders. The Policy Report 
will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM and 
the policy will take formal effect from that date. It is structured  
in the following sections:
A. Strategic overview and policy drivers;
B.  How the views of shareholders and employees have been 
taken into account;
C. The new remuneration policy for Executive Directors;
D. Reasons for changing the previous remuneration policy;
E.  Annual bonus - Choice of performance measures and 
approach to target-setting;

GOVERNANCE
GOVERNANCE These are continuing factors. However, there have been major 
changes in our remuneration strategy since last year, driven by 
the decision to rejuvenate and reinvigorate the Board and to 
sharpen the focus of the executive team on raising total 
shareholder returns over the next five-year period. It is anticipated 
that by this year's AGM, all Executive Directors in post at the last 
AGM will have left the Board. In October 2013 the Company 
recruited two new Executive Directors Mr. Treger as CEO, and 
Mr. Potter as CIO on the explicit basis that they would be entitled 
to a significant share of any increase in shareholder value created 
from when they joined. The Committee has worked with its 
remuneration advisers, NBS, on designing a new LTIP in the form 
of a VCP , the details of which are discussed at section F below.
The VCP is based on the growth in the absolute TSR achieved 
over the next five years. We believe that this offers the most direct 
alignment of Directors' interests with those of shareholders. We 
have considered how far a TSR measure could lead to over- or 
under-rewarding due to the impact on the share price of factors 
outside management control such as commodity price volatility. 
We believe this risk is limited, partly by the length of the 
performance period which comes close to covering a full 
commodity price cycle, partly by the relative predictability of royalty 
volumes; and partly by the relatively large dividend component  
of the TSR expected to flow from the Company's progressive 
dividend strategy. The performance target that has to be achieved 
before any options are awarded is considered challenging; and 
there is a powerful incentive for both outperformance and 
retention over the next five years. If shareholders endorse these 
remuneration proposals, the Committee proposes to offer senior 
non-Board managers some access to the LTIP . 
To attract the new Executive Directors the Company needed  
to offer basic salaries closer to market levels than the sub-lower 
quartile salaries of the past. However, they have been pre-set  
for the period through to December 2016 and, as part of the 
package, the cap on annual bonus has been reduced from 150% 
of salary to 100% whilst the bonus criteria has been made more 
transparent. The Committee is reviewing the bonus structure for 
non-Board senior managers to ensure a sensible relationship 
between Board and non-Board remuneration (see section I below).
B. How the views of shareholders and employees have been taken 
into account
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in 
relation to the AGM each year. Details of votes cast for and against 
the resolution to approve last year's remuneration report are 
provided in the Annual Remuneration Report. This feedback, plus 
any additional feedback received during any meetings from time 
to time, is then considered as part of the Company's annual 
review of remuneration policy. Feedback during 2013 included 
concern that the Company's JSOP did not reward performance 
above the hurdle rate and concern about its  all or nothing' nature.
The Committee actively engaged with major shareholders  
on the proposed remuneration of the new Directors, and was 
encouraged by the general support shown for the proposals  
on basic salary and annual bonus. We have made a number of 
changes to the LTIP in response to the constructive feedback we 
received. A remuneration framework has now been set for the 
next three years. If there is a need for a material change to the 
framework within this period, the Committee Chairman will 
consult major shareholders in advance.

Remuneration policy report
A. Strategic overview and policy drivers
In our 2012 Report we identified three important elements that 
had historically shaped the Company's remuneration policy. The 
Company has:
  Long investment horizons (typically there can be an interval of 
between two and 10 years before a royalty comes on stream 
and the royalty may continue to flow for 20 years or more). As 
the business focus has increasingly shifted towards royalty 
acquisition, we have given greater weighting towards 
incentivising longer-term performance.
  No comparable peer group, certainly in the UK, for the 
purposes of benchmarking Director performance. As a result, 
our incentive plans are based on absolute performance rather 
than performance relative to other companies.
  A high ratio between its market capitalisation ( 204m as at 
December 31, 2013) and the number of its employees (13 as at 
March 28, 2014, of whom three were Executive Directors). The 
risk to the business of losing key employees is correspondingly 
significant, and we have traditionally regarded retention as an 
important objective of our remuneration strategy.

and level of their own pay and bonuses.
C. The new remuneration policy for Executive Directors
The policy proposed for shareholder approval in respect of basic salary and annual bonus covers the three years 2014-16. The LTIP covers a 
five year period from the date of its grant (i.e. to mid-2019). The Committee expects to seek shareholder agreement in 2016 to a follow-on 
policy on basic salary and annual bonus, and probably also to further long-term incentive arrangements covering the period beyond 2018.
The Committee's specific policy for each element of remuneration is as follows:
Element, purpose  
and link to strategy Operation Maximum
Salary
To recruit, retain and reward 
executives of a suitable calibre 
for the role and duties 
required.
Salaries are set with reference to individual performance, 
experience and responsibilities to reflect the market rate 
for the individual and their role, determined with 
reference to remuneration levels in companies of similar 
size and complexity, taking into account pay levels within 
the Company in general.
There is no prescribed maximum annual increase but 
salaries have been set for 2014 to 2016 on a full-time 
equivalent basis, as follows:
 '000 2014 2015 2016
CEO 360 380 400
CIO 180 190 200
Pension and benefits
To provide market competitive
benefits
A Company contribution to a money purchase pension 
scheme, or a cash allowance in lieu of pension at the 
request of the individual. Other than a death in service 
policy which the Company subscribes to, no other benefits 
are provided.
Executive Directors are entitled to 30 days' leave.
Pension: 10% of salary.
Death in service policy: five times salary.
Annual bonus
To encourage and reward 
delivery of the Company's 
operational objectives
The annual bonus will be paid wholly in cash with no 
deferred component, but with a provision for clawback. 
Up to 60% may be awarded for in-year achievement 
of corporate performance targets which are to be agreed 
by the Board at the beginning of the year.
Up to 40% may be awarded for in-year achievement 
of personal performance targets which are to be agreed 
with the Chairman and the Committee. 
The Committee will use a balanced scorecard approach to 
assess performance against targets at the end of the year.
The targets are discussed more fully at section E below.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity is 100% of salary.
Long-term incentives
To encourage and reward 
delivery of the Company's 
strategic objectives and 
provide alignment with 
shareholders through the use 
of shares and incentivise 
retention of key personnel.
The LTIP will take the form of a VCP with a performance 
period of five years from the date of grant (i.e. to 
mid-2019).
Awards will be subject to a TSR performance condition.
The detailed design is discussed at section F below.
The maximum number of shares that can be awarded under 
the option grants equates to 7.5% of the Company's issued 
share capital as at the end of the measurement period.
The Committee intends to allocate the pool as follows:
CEO   56%
CIO   24%
Non-Board senior managers  20%
The potential rewards achievable by Executive Directors under the remuneration policy are illustrated at section G. The policy in respect 
of any future Director appointments is discussed at section J below.
D. Reasons for changing the previous remuneration policy
The new remuneration package summarised above represents a significant change to the remuneration policy that has applied up 
until 2013. 
Previously basic salaries were reviewed annually by the Committee, with a view to progressive alignment with lower quartile levels 
within similar sized FTSE companies through annual increases of around  20-25,000, and with a primary aim of retention. To attract 
new directors, the Company has had to offer, in addition to stronger long-term incentives, initial basic salaries closer to the median 
market rate for similar companies.
The annual bonus opportunity was previously capped at 150% of basic salary. It was designed to encourage and reward delivery of the 
Company's operational objectives and to build Directors' shareholding in the Company (through part payment in shares). The cap has 
now been reduced to 100%, partly reflecting the higher basic salary, but mainly to reflect the Committee's concern to tilt the remuneration 
package towards incentivising longer-term TSR performance through a new LTIP . The focus of the annual bonus has also changed. 
It was previously geared largely to securing a threshold value of new royalty agreements during the year, which meant that Directors' 
remuneration was not directly exposed to the risk that income from them might be later or lower than expected. Under the new 
remuneration policy, royalty acquisition is principally rewarded through the LTIP , and those rewards will accordingly reflect any royalty delays 
and shortfalls to a much greater extent. The annual bonus is now focused on the achievement of in-year corporate business, financial and 
relationship objectives, together with a greater emphasis on achievement of personal objectives by individual Directors (see section E).

APG01 | AR13 | 31/03/2014 | BACK proof 7
GOVERNANCE Directors' remuneration report
  Subject to such threshold growth, participants would become 
entitled to receive nil or nominal cost options over ordinary 
shares in the capital of the Company, subject to a cap, set by 
reference to a share of a pool value equal to 10% of the growth 
in the Company's TSR over the five year period or, if less, 50% 
of the growth in the Company's TSR over the five-year period in 
excess of the threshold growth.
  The maximum number of shares to be awarded under the 
option grants will not be capable of exceeding such number 
equating to 7.5% of the Company's issued share capital as at 
the end of the measurement period. This cap would apply for 
total growth in TSR above 300%.
  This will mean that, if the total growth in TSR over the five-year 
period is:
 - below approximately 40%, no value accrues;
 - between approximately 40% and 50%, the value that 
accrues is equal to 50% of the growth in the Company's TSR 
over the five-year period in excess of the threshold growth;
 - between 50% and the 300% cap, the value that accrues is 
equal to 10% of the growth in the Company's TSR over a 
five-year period; and
 - above the cap, the value that accrues is equal to the value of 
7.5% of the Company's issued share capital as at the end of 
the measurement period.
  Options to which participants become entitled at the end of the 
five-year period will become exercisable as follows:
 - One-third immediately;
 - One-third after 12 months;
 - One-third after 24 months.
  Awards will be made following shareholder approval of the VCP 
at the forthcoming AGM, and no other grants to the Executive 
Directors under the VCP are planned during the five year plan 
period; although the Committee will have discretion to dilute 
the pool by an additional 10% for new joiners.
  The Committee intends to allocate the pool as follows:
 - CEO - 56%
 - CIO - 24%
 - Non-Board senior managers - 20%
The following table and graph illustrates the potential return for 
participants and shareholders for various levels of growth in TSR 
over the five-year period:

Under the previous strategy it was normal for part of the annual 
bonus to be paid in the form of shares. However the rewards 
available under the new LTIP will be wholly in the form of shares. 
In addition the Executive Directors have separately agreed to inject 
substantial new share capital into the Company over time. The 
Committee accordingly believes it is appropriate that the annual 
bonus for Executive Directors should be paid wholly in cash.
The Company has previously offered two share-based longer-
term share schemes to Executive Directors and certain other 
employees: a Company Share Option Scheme ( CSOP') and the 
JSOP . Awards were granted subject to continued employment 
and satisfaction of performance conditions measured over three 
years including a TSR performance condition. No grants were 
made under either plan in 2013, and it is not intended that further 
grants under either scheme will be made to Executive Directors. 
E. Annual bonus - Choice of performance measures and approach 
to target setting
Annual bonuses for 2014 and the two subsequent years will be 
based on a scorecard of performance during the year. The 
scorecard will set challenging targets for triggering bonus, and for 
rewarding out performance on a sliding scale. The scorecard will 
be split on a 60/40 basis between corporate objectives and 
personal objectives.
The corporate objectives will be agreed by the Board at the 
beginning of each year, together with an assessment of the 
potential for outperformance and the risk of shortfall. They will 
cover such areas as business performance, finance, relationships 
and reputation. These will constitute the criteria for triggering a 
bonus and for assessing the levels of challenge and 
outperformance that would warrant higher levels of bonus. The 
CEO's personal objectives for the year will be agreed at the 
beginning of the year by the Chairman of the Board in conjunction 
with the Committee, who will also agree the personal objectives 
of the CIO in conjunction with the CEO. The personal objectives 
will focus on the required contribution of the individual Director to 
the achievement of the Company's objectives for the year, but 
also on important but less measurable aspects such as 
leadership, building personal and team relationships, and the 
extent to which they personally have  gone the extra mile'.
The CEO's and CIO's performance against corporate and 
personal objectives will be assessed by the Board Chairman and 
the Committee at the beginning of the following year, and bonus 
will be awarded on the basis of the agreed criteria.
F. LTIP - Principal terms and conditions and reward scenarios
The LTIP will take the form of a VCP . The key features of the VCP 
are as follows: 
  All employees will be eligible to participate in the VCP; although 
it is currently expected that initial participation will be limited to 
the two new Executive Directors together with other non-Board 
members of the senior management team at the discretion of 
the Committee acting in consultation with the CEO.
  No value would accrue under the VCP to its participants unless 
growth in the Company's TSR over a five year performance 
period is at least equal to 7% growth per annum (or 
approximately 40% total growth over the period).

  Salary levels (on which other elements of the package are

determinations and apply certain operational discretions.  
These include the following:
  selecting the participants in the plans on an annual basis;
  determining the timing of grants of awards and/or payment;
  adjusting basic salaries for changes in time commitment  
(within the full-time equivalent levels set out in this policy);
  determining the quantum of awards and/or payments

the nature and time horizons attaching to that remuneration and 
the impact of any performance conditions. Shareholders will be 
informed of any such payments at the time of appointment. 
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable  
pay element awarded in respect of the prior role will be allowed 
to pay out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take  
into account the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing 
remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may 
continue, provided that they are put to shareholders for approval 
at the earliest opportunity. 
For external Executive Director appointments, the Committee

to ensure that these reflect best practice. 
Although all of the Executive Directors' service contracts are  
for an indefinite term, it is the Company's continuing policy that 
service contracts should not have a notice period of more than 
one year.
The service contracts contain provision for early termination. 
A Director's service contract may be terminated without notice 
and without any further payment or compensation, except for 
sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence 
of certain events such as gross misconduct. If the employing 
company terminates the employment of an Executive Director 
in other circumstances, compensation is limited to salary due 
for any unexpired notice period and any amount assessed by 
the Committee as representing the value of other contractual 
benefits (including pension) which would have been received 
during the period. Payments in lieu of notice are not pensionable. 
The service contracts of Mr. Potter and Mr. Treger provide for a 
six month notice period and an additional termination payment 
equivalent to six months' basic salary (as did the service 
contracts of Mr. Theobald and Mr. Orchard), whereas the service 
contract of Mr. Wides simply limits payment for loss of office  
to twelve months' basic salary (as did the service contract of 
Mr. Boycott). In the event of a change of control of the Company 
there is no enhancement to contractual terms. Service contracts 
are available for inspection at the Company's registered office.
  making the appropriate adjustments required in certain 
circumstances (e.g. change of control, variation of share capital 
including rights issues and corporate restructuring events,  
and special dividends); 
  determining  good leaver' status for incentive plan purposes 
and applying the appropriate treatment; and
  undertaking the annual review of weighting of performance 
measures, and setting targets for the annual bonus plan from 
year to year.
If an event occurs which results in the annual bonus plan or 
long-term incentive performance conditions and/or targets  
being deemed no longer appropriate (e.g. a material acquisition  
or divestment), the Committee will have the ability to adjust 
appropriately the measures and/or targets and alter weightings, 
provided that the revised conditions or targets are not materially 
less difficult to satisfy.
I. Differences in remuneration policy for Executive Directors 
compared to other employees
The Committee aims to ensure, over time, a proper differential 
between the level of the remuneration of Executive Directors and 
other employees, but also appropriate differences in the structure 
of remuneration to reflect different levels of responsibility and 
planning horizons of employees across the Company.
The remuneration framework of non-Board employees will be 
reviewed for 2014 and subsequent years in the light of the overall 
remuneration package shareholders agree for the new Executive 
Directors. There are likely to be two main differences: 
  the Committee will reserve access to the LTIP to the most 
senior executives who have the greatest potential to influence 
the Company's long-term performance; and
  the Executive Directors will receive any annual bonus wholly in 
cash because of the large potential shareholding offered by the 
LTIP; but in order to encourage employees without access (or 
with less access) to the LTIP to build up a shareholding in the 
Company, consideration will be given to either including a share 
component in any annual bonuses awarded to non-Board 
employees, or continuing to offer them a CSOP arrangement, 
or a combination of the two. 
J. Approach to appointment of new Executive Directors
The remuneration package for a new Director would be set  
in accordance with the terms of the Company's approved 
remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment. 
Currently, for an Executive Director, this would include a potential 
annual bonus of no more than 100%. There is provision within 
the proposed LTIP arrangement for the Committee to dilute the 
pool by an additional 10% for new appointees.
The salary for a new Executive Director may be set below the 
normal market rate, with phased increases following an initial 
probationary period and over the first few years as the executive 
gains experience in their new role. This is the salary profile 
applied to the two Executive Directors appointed in 2013.
The Committee may offer new appointees additional cash and/or 
share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best 
interests of the Company and its shareholders, including the use 
of awards made under 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules. Such payments 
would take account of remuneration relinquished when leaving

GOVERNANCE Directors' remuneration report
In summary, the contractual provisions for Executive Directors are as follows:
Provision Detailed terms 
Notice period One year or less.
Termination payment Basic salary plus benefits (including pension), paid monthly and subject to mitigation.
In addition, any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection  
with the termination would be paid as necessary.
Additional termination payment to bring total to the equivalent of twelve months' basic salary.
Remuneration entitlements A pro-rata bonus may also become payable for the period of active service along with vesting  
for outstanding share awards (in certain circumstances - see below). 
In all cases performance targets would apply.
Change of control There are no enhanced terms in relation to a change of control.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the VCP will be determined based on the plan rules. The default 
treatment is that any outstanding unvested awards lapse on cessation of employment. However, in certain prescribed circumstances, 
such as death, disability, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee (taking into account the individual's 
performance and the reasons for their departure)  good leaver' status can be applied. For good leavers, the unvested awards remain 
subject to performance conditions (measured over the original time period) and are reduced pro-rata in size to reflect the proportion of 
the performance period actually served. The Committee has the discretion to disapply time pro-rating if it considers it appropriate to  
do so. In determining whether an executive should be treated as a good leaver or not, the Committee will take into account the 
performance of the individual and the reasons for their departure.
L. Non-Executive Directors
The Company aims to attract and retain a high-calibre Chairman and Non-Executive Directors by offering a market competitive fee 
level. 
The Committee's specific policy is as follows: 
Element, purpose  
and link to strategy Operation Maximum
Fee
Attract, retain and 
fairly reward high 
calibre individuals.
Fees are paid in cash. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the Company's  
annual performance related incentive schemes, share option schemes or pension scheme. 
The Chairman is paid a single fee for all his responsibilities. The Non-Executive Directors are paid  
a basic fee. Additional fees are paid to Chairmen and members of the main Board Committees and  
to the SID to reflect their extra responsibilities.
Fees are reviewed by the Board taking into account individual responsibilities, factors such as 
Committee Chairmanships, time commitment, other pay increases being made to employees in  
the Company, and fees payable for the equivalent role in comparable companies. 
Normally fees are reviewed bi-annually and fee increases are generally effective from annual 
re-election after the AGM.
The Board may adjust the fees for an individual Non-Executive Director during the intervening period 
if there is a significant change in their responsibilities and/or time commitments.
Current fee levels are set 
out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
Overall fee limit will be 
within the  400,000 limit 
set out in the Company's 
Articles of Association.
Mr. Yadgaroff, Dr. Whellock and Mr. Atkinson have letters of appointment for an indefinite term, although they may be terminated 
by either party subject to one month's notice. Mr. Cooke , Mr. Blyth and Mr. Stan were appointed on rolling three-year contracts 
with a one-month notice period and the Board intends that all future Non-Executive Directors appointments will be on similar terms. 
None of the letters of appointment have provisions that relate to a change of control of the Company. 
The details of the Non-Executive Director's letters of appointment are as follows:
Non-Executive Date of appointment Notice period
M.H. Atkinson February 9, 2006 30 days
W.M. Blyth March 20, 2013 One month

GOVERNANCE Directors' remuneration report
B. Annual bonus for the year ending December 31, 2013
The bonus award for the year under review was based on performance against the value of new royalties achieved, operating profit and 
dividends per share. As in 2012, the value of new royalties acquired during the year fell short of the target. Further, although the dividend was 
maintained, the fall in operating profit and net asset value led the Committee to conclude that no bonus should be paid in respect of 2013.
C. Vesting of long-term incentive awards
Awards granted on May 20, 2010 under the CSOP were subject to a performance condition that the Company's absolute TSR must 
grow at a rate of 3% per annum (not compounded) in excess of the UK Retail Price Index over the three years from the date of grant. 
This condition was not met and, consequently, no awards vested.
Awards granted on May 19, 2010 under the JSOP were subject to two performance conditions as follows: 
(a)  that the Company's share price must reach a hurdle price of 315p during the three years from the date of grant; and 
(b)  that the Company's absolute total shareholder return must grow at a rate of 3% per annum (not compounded) in excess of the  
UK Retail Price Index over the three years from the date of grant. 
Whilst the first condition was met, the second was not and, consequently, no awards vested. 
The following table summarises the awards held by Executive Directors who served during the year and whose performance periods 
ended during the year.

Long-term incentive awards made during the year
There were no awards granted to Executive Directors under either the JSOP or the CSOP in 2013.
Outstanding share awards
There are currently no awards to Executive Directors outstanding under either the JSOP or the CSOP . 
D. Directors' shareholding and share interests
The Committee encourages the Executive Directors to build up a shareholding in the Company, so as to ensure the alignment of their 
interest with those of shareholders; but there is no formal shareholding guideline. In addition, the proposed new VCP is designed to 
increase this alignment. The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are also encouraged to hold shares in the Company although the 
Chairman and independent Non-Executive Directors are expected to ensure that the level of their shareholding is not significant and 
cannot call into question their continuing independence.
Details of the Directors' interests in shares are shown in the table below.

The Company makes contributions to employees' pensions and 
has designated AEGON Scottish Equitable PLC as its stakeholder 
pension provider. The Committee is prepared to pay additional 
basic salary (or fees) in lieu of part or all of a Director's pension 
contribution.
During 2013, the Company paid additional basic salary (or fees) 
in lieu of pension contribution to Mr. Boycott, Mr. Wides, and 
Mr. Orchard.
F. Loss of office payments
Mr. Theobald and Mr. Orchard left the Company on October 21, 
2013. Mr. Theobald received his annual salary and pension up to 
November 30, 2013 and Mr. Orchard received his annual salary 
and pension up to October 31, 2013. Under the terms of their 
service agreements, the Company then paid them termination 
payments equivalent to 6 months' salary and payments in lieu 
of notice as compensation for loss of office as follows:
J. Theobald A.C. Orchard
Termination payment  
(equivalent to six months salary)  95,000  85,000
Payment in lieu of notice  63,333  70,833
Total  158,333  155,833
Mr. Theobald and Mr. Orchard each also received  2,400 as a 
contribution to legal fees incurred by them in connection with 
their departures.

  This reflects the salary for Mr. Theobald up until October 21, 2013, the date 
Mr. Theobald resigned from the Board and Mr. Treger joined, and the salary 
(on a full-time equivalent basis) for Mr. Treger thereafter.
The table above shows the movement in the salary, benefits and 
annual bonus for the CEO between the current and previous 
financial year compared to that for the average UK employee. 
The Committee has chosen this comparator and it feels that it 
provides a more appropriate reflection of the earnings of the 
average worker than the movement in the Group's total wage bill, 
which is distorted by movements in the number of employees. 
For the benefits and bonus per employee, this is based on those 
employees eligible to participate in such schemes.
H. Total shareholder return
The performance of the Company's ordinary shares compared with the FTSE 350 Mining Index for the five-year period ended on 
December 31, 2013 is shown in the graph above. Both have been rebased at the start of the period in order to provide a graphical 
measure of comparative performance.
The Company has chosen the FTSE 350 Mining Index as a comparator for historical reporting purposes as it believes it to be the 
nearest relevant index appropriate to the Group.
The middle market price of an ordinary share on December 31, 2013 was 184p. During the year the share price ranged from a low  
of 159p to a high of 293p.

M. Fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
As detailed in the remuneration policy, the Company's approach 
to setting Non-Executive Directors' remuneration is with 
reference to market levels in similar companies, levels of 
responsibility and time commitments. A summary of current  
fees is as follows: 
2014 2013 % Increase
Chairman 95,000 N/A
1
n/a
Base fee 36,000 36,000 0%
Senior Independent 
Director 42,000 42,000 0%
Committee Chairman 
or Member 38,000 38,000 0%
1)
 The Chairman during 2013 was an acting Executive Chairman
Up to the end of March 2014, the Chairman was a part-time 
Executive Director post, and the Chairmanship component was 
not separately remunerated. On March 28, 2014, the Company 
announced the appointment of Mr. Blyth as Non-Executive 
Chairman with effect from April 1, 2014. On the recommendation 
of the other members of the Remuneration Committee his fee 
was set at  95,000 per annum for a two-year period having 
regard to the time commitment required (6 days a month) and 
the level of fees in similar companies.
Chairmen and members of the main Board Committees are paid 
an additional amount, currently  2,000 per annum, to reflect 
extra commitments. The SID also receives a further additional 
fee, currently  4,000 per annum, to reflect his extra duties.
N. Performance targets for the annual bonus and LTIP awards  
to be granted in 2014 and beyond
Annual bonuses and long-term incentive awards for 2014 will be 
made in accordance with the new policy, further details of which 
are detailed in the Remuneration Policy Report.
For 2014, annual bonuses will be based on a scorecard of 
performance during the year. The scorecard will set challenging 
targets for triggering bonus, and for rewarding outperformance 
on a sliding scale. The scorecard will be split on a 60/40 basis 
between corporate objectives and personal objectives.  
Corporate objectives for 2014 will cover areas such as business 
performance, finance, relationships and reputation. 
The Committee has chosen not to disclose the performance 
targets for the forthcoming year in advance as these include 
items which the Committee considers commercially sensitive. 
Retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against 
them will be provided in next year's Annual Remuneration 
Report.
Long-term incentive awards for 2014 will be made under a  
new one-off VCP (subject to approval by shareholders at the 
forthcoming AGM) with a five-year performance period from the 
date of grant (i.e. to mid-2019). No value accrues under the VCP 
to its participants unless growth in the Company's TSR over the 
performance period is at least equal to 7% growth per annum  
(or approximately 40% total growth over the period).
