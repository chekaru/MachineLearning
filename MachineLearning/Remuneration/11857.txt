 ANGLO - EASTERN PLANTATIONS PLC

This report by the remuneration committee has been approved by the board of directors for submission to
shareholders for their approval at the forthcoming annual general meeting.
Membership
The remuneration committee comprised throughout the year Mr Ho and Mr O'Connor and was chaired by
Datuk Chin.  The committee met three times in 2005 attended by all members.
Policy
The remuneration committee makes recommendations on senior management pay and conditions, after
consultation with the chief executive, and recommends to the board the terms of executive directors.
Non-executive directors' remuneration is considered by the board as a whole.
The committee recommends remuneration terms by reference to individual performance, market
conditions, the company's performance and the need to maintain an economic operation.
Components
Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed on an annual basis by the remuneration committee or when an individual
changes responsibilities.  Non-executive directors receive no benefits other than a fee.
Bonus
The group operates a bonus scheme for senior executives and managers which is generally determined by
operating performance criteria.  Annual bonuses for senior executives and managers are capped at 66% of
base salary.  Executive directors receive a bonus which has ranged from 0% to 41% in past years, at the
discretion of the board.
Share options
The UK and overseas executive share option schemes of the company are administered and supervised by
a committee consisting, in the majority, of non-executive directors.  These schemes are limited over their
10 year life to issuing no more than 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the company from time to
time.  They provide for options to be granted over treasury shares as well as over new shares.  To avoid
dilution, the board intends generally to follow the treasury share route.  
Individual grants are phased over three years.  The total grant to each holder is determined by seniority and
total market value at date of grant is limited to four times base salary.  Exercise of options is only permitted
three years after grant.  There are no performance criteria for exercise.
Pensions
There is no company pension scheme for executive directors or senior executives and management.  In the
case of one executive director, Mr Barnes, the company makes contributions based on base salary only to
a personal money purchase scheme.  Senior executives who leave voluntarily after more than five years'
service are entitled to a gratuity of one month's base salary for each year of service.
Service contracts
Other than Mr Barnes, as a matter of policy no director has either a service contract or notice period.  Mr
Barnes has a contract which expires in May 2007.  In the event of an early termination by the company this
contract provides for a termination payment equivalent to the lower of one year or the outstanding term of
the contract.  Notice periods for all other senior management are generally three and six months.
Directors' remuneration report Performance graph
The graph on the right shows the company's
performance, measured by capital return, compared
to the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE)
Plantation Index for the period 1 January 2000 to 27
March 2006.  This is the only relevant index
available in terms of sector but, any comparison
should be qualified; many Malaysian plantation
companies are diversified, as well as not holding as
great a proportion of their assets in Indonesia as
Anglo-Eastern.
In determining senior management compensation,
the remuneration committee is influenced by the
operating performance of the company and not
directly by the share price.
