 19 Annual Report 2009 | Anglo-Eastern Plantations Plc 
 
Directors' Remuneration Report 
 
 
This report by the remuneration committee has been approved by the board of directors for submission to 
shareholders for their approval at the forthcoming annual general meeting. 
 
Membership 
The remuneration committee comprised during the year Dato' John Lim (chairman), Datuk Henry Chin (former 
chairman until retirement on 19 June 2009) and Drs.Kanaka Puradiredja (appointed 1 August 2009). The committee 
met once in 2009 and again in 2010, attended by both members. 
 
Policy 
The remuneration committee makes recommendations on senior management pay and conditions, after consultation 
with the Chairman, and recommends to the board the terms of executive directors. 
 
Non-executive directors' remuneration is considered by the board as a whole. 
 
The committee recommends remuneration terms by reference to individual performance, market conditions, the 
company's performance and the need to maintain an economic operation. 
 
Components 
Base salary 
Base salaries are reviewed on an annual basis by the remuneration committee or when an individual changes 
responsibilities. Non-executive directors receive no benefits other than a fee. 
 
Bonus 
The group operates a bonus scheme for senior executives and managers of operating units, which is determined by 
weighted performance criteria. Annual bonuses for the Chairman and executive directors are determined at the 
discretion of the board. 
 
Share options 
The UK and overseas executive share option schemes of the company are administered and supervised by a 
committee consisting, in the majority, of non-executive directors. These schemes are limited over their 10 year life to 
issuing no more than 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the company from time to time. They provide for 
options to be granted over treasury shares as well as over new shares. To avoid dilution, the board intends generally 
to follow the treasury share route. 
 
Individual grants are phased over three years. The total grant to each holder is determined by seniority and total 
market value at date of grant is normally limited to two times base salary. Exercise of options is only permitted three 
years after grant, provided that the holder remains an employee of the group throughout the period. There are no 
other performance criteria for exercise of options granted so far. 
 
Pensions 
There is no company-sponsored pension scheme for executive directors or senior executives and management.  
 
Service contracts 
All directors, executive and non-executive, have formal appointment letters. Those of the non-executives are all for 
two to three year terms with notice periods of one month. Mr. Donald Low's contract had been extended to 25 
November 2009 with a further extension until 25 May 2010. Notice periods for all other senior management are 
generally between three and six months.
