Directors' Remuneration Report 
 
 
 
This report by the remuneration committee has been approved by the Board of Directors for submission to 
shareholders for their approval at the forthcoming annual general meeting. 
 
Membership 
The remuneration committee comprised during the year Drs. Kanaka Puradiredja (Chairman), Mr. Chan Teik Huat 
(appointed on 1 September 2010 and retired on 31 January 2011), and Mr. Nik Din Nik Sulaiman (appointed on 1 
September 2010). The committee met three times in 2010, attended by all members, Dato John Lim resigned as 
Chairman of remuneration committee on 31 August 2010 and was re-appointed as a member on 8 April 2011. 
 
Policy 
The remuneration committee makes recommendations on senior management pay and conditions, after 
consultation with the Chairman, and recommends to the Board the terms of Executive Directors. 
 
Non-Executive Directors  remuneration is considered by the Board as a whole. 
 
When determining executive director s remuneration, the committee reviews the pay policy and levels for 
executives below the board, as well as pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group. Other factors 
considered are individual performance, market conditions, the Company s performance and the need to maintain 
an economic operation. 
 
Components 
Base salary 
Base salaries are reviewed on an annual basis by the remuneration committee or when an individual changes 
responsibilities. Non-Executive Directors receive no benefit other than a fee.  
 
Bonus 
The Group operates a bonus scheme for senior executives and managers of operating units, which is determined 
by weighted performance criteria. Annual bonus for Executive Director is determined at the discretion of the Board. 
 
Share options 
The UK and overseas executive share option schemes of the Company are administered and supervised by a 
committee consisting, in the majority, of Non-Executive Directors. These schemes are limited over their 10 year life 
to issuing no more than 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company from time to time. They provide 
for options to be granted over treasury shares as well as over new shares. To avoid dilution, the Board intends 
generally to follow the treasury share route. 
 
Individual grants vest over three years. The total grant to each holder is determined by seniority and total market 
value at date of grant is normally limited to two times base salary. Exercise of options is only permitted three years 
after grant, provided that the holder remains an employee of the Group throughout the period. There are no other 
performance criteria for exercise of options granted so far. 
 
Pensions 
There is no company-sponsored pension scheme for Executive Directors or Senior Executives and management.  
 
Service contracts 
All Directors, Executive and Non-Executive, have formal appointment letters. Those of the Non-Executives are all 
for two year terms with notice periods of one month. Mr. Donald Low resigned from the Board and relinquished the 
role of Acting Chief Executive upon the expiry of his contract on 25 May 2010. Notice periods for all other senior 
management are generally two months.
