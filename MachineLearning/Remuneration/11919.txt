Directors' Remuneration Report 
 
 
 
This report by the Remuneration Committee has been approved by the Board of Directors for submission to 
shareholders for their approval at the forthcoming annual general meeting. 
 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee comprises of Drs. Kanaka Puradiredja (Chairman), Mr. Nik Din Bin Nik Sulaiman 
and Dato' John Lim. The Committee had three meetings during 2011, attended by all members. Drs. Kanaka was 
appointed as Chairman on 31 August 2010 after Dato' John Lim resigned as Chairman. Mr. Nik Din Nik Sulaiman 
was appointed to the Committee on 1 September 2010. Mr. Chan Teik Huat sat in the Committee from 1 
September 2010 until his retirement on 31 January 2011. Dato John Lim was appointed as a member on 8 April 
2011.  
 
Policy 
The Remuneration Committee makes recommendations on senior management pay and conditions, after 
consultation with the Chairman, and recommends to the Board the terms of Executive Directors. 
 
Non-Executive Directors' remuneration is considered by the Board as a whole. 
 
When determining Executive Director's remuneration, the committee reviews the pay policy and levels for 
executives below the board, as well as pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group. Other factors 
considered are individual performance, market conditions, the Company's performance and the need to maintain 
an economic operation. 
 
Components 
Base salary 
Base salaries are reviewed on an annual basis by the Remuneration Committee or when an individual changes 
responsibilities. Non-Executive Directors receive no benefit other than a fee.  
 
Bonus 
The Group operates a bonus scheme for senior executives and managers of operating units, which is determined 
by weighted performance criteria.  
 
Share options 
The UK and overseas executive share option schemes of the Company are administered and supervised by a 
committee consisting, in the majority, of Non-Executive Directors. These schemes are limited over their 10 year life 
to issuing no more than 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company from time to time. They provide 
for options to be granted over treasury shares as well as over new shares. To avoid dilution, the Board intends 
generally to follow the treasury share route. 
 
Individual grants vest over three years. The total grant to each holder is determined by seniority and total market 
value at date of grant is normally limited to two times base salary. Exercise of options is only permitted three years 
after grant, provided that the holder remains an employee of the Group throughout the period. There are no other 
performance criteria for exercise of options granted so far. 
 
Pensions 
The operating units in Indonesia participate in mandatory pension schemes for their local executives and 
management. There is no Company-sponsored scheme for senior executives outside of Indonesia. 
 
Service contracts 
All Directors, Executive and Non-Executive, have formal appointment letters. Those of the Non-Executives are all 
for two year terms with notice periods of one month. Notice periods for all other senior management are generally 
two months.  25 Annual Report 2011 | Anglo-Eastern Plantations Plc
