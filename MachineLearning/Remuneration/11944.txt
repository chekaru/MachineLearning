 Directors' Remuneration Report 
 
Annual Report 2012 | Anglo-Eastern Plantations Plc 33 
This report by the Remuneration Committee has been approved by the Board of Directors for submission to 
shareholders for their approval at the forthcoming annual general meeting. 
 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee comprises of Drs. Kanaka Puradiredja (Chairman), Mr. Nik Din Bin Nik Sulaiman and 
Dato' John Lim. The Committee had two meetings during 2012, attended by all members. Drs. Kanaka was 
appointed as Chairman on 31 August 2010. Mr. Nik Din Nik Sulaiman was appointed to the Committee on 1 
September 2010 while Dato John Lim was appointed as a member on 8 April 2011.  
 
Compliance 
The directors are satisfied that as far as practical the Company has complied with the provision of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and Revised Combined Code relating to Directors' Remuneration throughout the year. 
Policy 
The Remuneration Committee makes recommendations on senior management pay and conditions, after 
consultation with the Chairman, and recommends to the Board the terms for Executive Director. 
 
Non-Executive Directors' remuneration is considered by the Board as a whole. 
 
When determining Executive Director's remuneration, the committee reviews the pay policy and levels for executives 
below the board, as well as pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group. Other factors considered are 
individual performance, market conditions, the Company's performance, pay and employment conditions of its other 
employees in the organisation and the need to maintain an economic operation. This policy is currently to be applied 
in subsequent years. 
 
Components 
Base salary 
Base salaries are reviewed on an annual basis by the Remuneration Committee or when an individual changes 
responsibilities. Non-Executive Directors receive no benefit other than a fee.  
 
Bonus 
The Group operates a bonus scheme for senior executives and managers of operating units, which is determined by 
weighted performance criteria.  
 
Share options 
The UK and overseas executive share option schemes of the Company are administered and supervised by a 
committee consisting, in the majority, of Non-Executive Directors. These schemes are limited over their 10 year life 
to issuing no more than 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company from time to time. They provide for 
options to be granted over treasury shares as well as over new shares. To avoid dilution, the Board intends generally 
to follow the treasury share route. 
 
Individual grants vest over three years. The total grant to each holder is determined by seniority and total market 
value at date of grant is normally limited to two times base salary. Exercise of options is only permitted three years 
after grant, provided that the holder remains an employee of the Group throughout the period. There are no other 
performance criteria for exercise of options granted so far.

Pensions 
The operating units in Indonesia participate in mandatory pension schemes for their local executives and 
management. There is no Company-sponsored scheme for senior executives outside of Indonesia. 
 
Service contracts 
All Directors, Executive and Non-Executive, have formal appointment letters. Those of the Non-Executives are all for 
two year terms with notice periods of one month. Notice periods for all other senior management are generally two 
months. 
 
Performance Graph 
The performance graph is set out on page 4 and shows the Company's share price performance compared to FTSE 
100 index for the period of 2008 to 2013 (last 5 years) to indicate the volatility and trend of the market generally. Our 
share price performance consistently outperformed the FTSE 100 index throughout these periods. In determining 
senior management compensation, the Remuneration Committee is influenced by the operating performance of the 
Company and not directly by the share price.
