 Directors' Remuneration Report 
 
Annual Report 2013 | Anglo-Eastern Plantations Plc 40 
Remuneration Committee Chairman's Statement 
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2013. 
 
The Companies Act 2006 governing the disclosures of the Directors' remuneration was revised and came into effect 
on 1 October 2013. Besides requiring additional disclosures the regulations also provide for the shareholders to 
approve Directors' Remuneration Report for the year under review and to approve the Directors' Remuneration 
Policy under Sec 439A of the Companies Act 2006. 
 
The Executive Director's compensation is not linked to the profitability of the Group. It is linked to his role in respect 
of activities relating to corporate finance and corporate affairs, including liaising with the Company's advisers and 
regulators and interaction with shareholders. The operating units in Indonesia and Malaysia however have in place 
variable compensation policy that rewards senior executives and employees bonuses ranging from 2 to 5 months' 
pay based on individual and operating units' performance. The variable compensation policy has remained 
unchanged since 2009. 
 
The Directors' remuneration policy includes a capped basic salary at  75,000 per annum or US$ equivalent for 
Executive Director. 
 
The Executive Director salary was increased by 20% from  62,400 to  75,000 when his contract was renewed for 
another 2 years in August 2012. 
 
The Directors' Remuneration Policy for the forthcoming year is set out as above. 
 
The Committee would welcome your support for our Remuneration Report.   
 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee comprises of Mr. Jonathan Law Ngee Song (Chairman), Mr. Nik Din Bin Nik Sulaiman 
and Dato' John Lim. Mr. Jonathan Law Ngee Song was appointed as member of the Remuneration Committee on 4 
July 2013 and assumed the Chairmanship of the Committee after Drs Kanaka's resignation on 31 July 2013. 
 
The Committee had two meetings during 2013, attended by all members.  
 
During the year the Remuneration Committee reviewed the annual increment and bonus entitlement of senior 
management in Indonesia and made the necessary recommendation to the Board. The Committee also deliberated 
on the 2012 Remuneration Report and recommended to the Board for acceptance.   
 
Policy 
The Remuneration Committee makes recommendations on senior management pay and conditions, after 
consultation with the Chairman, and recommends to the Board the terms for Executive Director. It periodically 
assesses the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors and submits proposal to the Board.  
 
In determining the remuneration policy of senior management, the Committee takes into account the need to attract, 
retain and motivate employees. It also make external comparison with the current market trends and practices of 
equivalent roles taking into account the size, business complexity and relative performance. 
  
Non-Executive Directors' remuneration is considered by the Board and consist exclusively of a fixed payment. 
 
  Directors' Remuneration Report 
 
Annual Report 2013 | Anglo-Eastern Plantations Plc 41 
When determining Executive Director's remuneration, the Committee reviews the pay policy and levels for 
executives below the board, as well as pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group. Other factors 
considered are individual performance, market conditions, the Company's performance, pay and employment 
conditions of its other employees in the organisation and the need to maintain an economic operation. This policy 
continue to be applied in subsequent years.  
 
Components 
Base salary 
Base salaries of senior management are reviewed on an annual basis by the Remuneration Committee or when an 
individual changes responsibilities. Non-Executive Directors receive no benefit other than a fee.  
 
Bonus 
The Group operates a bonus scheme for senior executives and managers of operating units, which is determined by 
weighted performance criteria including crop production, external crop purchase, increased in planted area, 
efficiency of mill performance and overall profitability. There is no bonus scheme for the Executive Director.  
 
Share options 
The UK and overseas executive share option schemes of the Company are administered and supervised by a 
committee consisting, in the majority, of Non-Executive Directors. These schemes are limited over their 10 year life 
to issuing no more than 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company from time to time. They provide for 
options to be granted over treasury shares as well as over new shares. To avoid dilution, the Board intends generally 
to follow the treasury share route. 
 
Individual grants vest over three years. The total grant to each holder is determined by seniority and total market 
value at date of grant is normally limited to two times base salary. Exercise of options is only permitted three years 
after grant, provided that the holder remains an employee of the Group throughout the period. There are no other 
performance criteria for exercise of options granted so far. 
 
Pensions 
The operating units in Indonesia participate in mandatory pension schemes for their local executives and 
management. There is no company-sponsored scheme for senior executives outside of Indonesia.

100 index for the period of 2009 to 2013 (last 5 years) to indicate the volatility and trend of the market generally. Our
