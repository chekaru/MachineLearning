Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee was originally constituted by the board on 28 February 2000 and its terms of reference were 
updated on 23 January 2004. It comprises a non-executive director, M Martineau, and, except when matters concerning their 
own positions are being considered, R Burt (Chairman of the Committee) and R M Andrews (Chairman & acting Chief Executive). 
The Committee meets as appropriate during the year. 
The Committee is responsible for determining annual salaries, incentive arrangements, service contracts and all other terms 
and conditions of employment of the executive directors, and the performance and development of its senior management. The 
Committee also provides advice to the executives on signifi cant policies affecting the remuneration of senior management below  
board level. The Committee has access to advice from external consultants as necessary. The Committee is also responsible for 
approving the terms of the share incentive arrangements for all senior management and employees across the Group.
At the present time, the Company provides neither post-retirement benefi ts, such as pensions, nor any benefi ts, such as private 
health care, to its executive directors. Consideration is, however, being given to the provision of such benefi ts in order to ensure 
that remuneration packages remain competitive.
Remuneration of non-executive directors
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the board as a whole. The non-executive directors do not take part 
in discussions on their remuneration. Non-executive directors have share options on the basis that their fees are regarded as 
below market rates. Non-executive directors do not have any pension arrangements with the Company.
Directors' remuneration
The remuneration of the directors of the Company for the year ended 28 February 2005 is disclosed in note 2 to the fi nancial statements:
