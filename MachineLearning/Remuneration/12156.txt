Role of the Remuneration Committee and terms of reference
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee ) operates within agreed terms of reference and determines:
  the Company's general policy on remuneration and benefits of the Executive Directors;
  the specific remuneration packages for Executive Directors of the Company including, but not limited to, basic salary, benefits 
and pensions, together with any annual performance-related incentive or share incentives; and
  the terms and conditions of employment of the Executive Directors.
Membership of the Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee is comprised of the Non-Executive Directors for the year ended 30 April 2003 and at all times when 
the Directors' remuneration for this year was being determined, namely:
  G S Caleb (Chairman)
  A Daly
  D A Thorpe
During the year under review, the members of the Remuneration Committee were considered to be independent of management 
and free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. 
On 22 May 2003, David Thorpe was appointed interim Chief Executive and ceased to be a member of the Committee. The Committee
met five times between 1 May 2002 and 30 April 2003. The Executive Directors may attend the Committee meetings by invitation and
assist the Committee in its considerations but they are not present when issues relating to their own compensation are discussed. No 
Director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration. 
For the year ending 30 April 2003, the Remuneration Committee consulted with the the following companies: 
  Hewitt, Bacon & Woodrow - Hewitt, Bacon & Woodrow were appointed by the Committee in February 2002 as independent
advisers to the Committee to advise on total remuneration, benchmarking, performance measurement and incentive design; 
  Olswang - Olswang gave general advice on matters relating to employment contracts and advised on certain aspects of the
Company's share option schemes; and
  UBS Investment Bank - UBS Investment Bank's opinion was sought on certain aspects of the Company's remuneration proposals 
and provided some raw data used to calculate the achievement of targets under the Group's share option schemes.
In the year ending 30 April 2003, the following advisers also provided services to the Company, as follows:
  Olswang as one of the Company's legal advisers; and
  UBS Investment Bank as the Company's financial adviser.
Remuneration policy 
Principles of executive remuneration
The Company's remuneration policy is designed to attract, retain and motivate executives of a high calibre. To achieve this objective,
the executive remuneration policy is framed around the following core principles:
  total rewards are designed to provide competitive packages within the market, taking each Director's total remuneration package
as a whole;
  incentive-based rewards are dependent upon the achievement of demanding performance conditions consistent with corporate
strategy in the short, medium and longer-term; and
  the design of long-term incentives is prudent, and designed to support the Company's business strategy.

Elements of executive remuneration
The Remuneration Committee will normally target the significant elements of the Executive Directors' remuneration as follows:
% of compensation
  salary 25
  annual bonus 25
(for achievement of stretching targets based on EPS and cash generation)
  long-term rewards 50
(50% for achievement of stretching targets based on profit and 50% based on 
total shareholder return (TSR )  when compared with a comparator group of companies)
TOTAL 100
However, with the critical need to appoint both a new Chief Executive and a new Finance Director in 2003 the Remuneration
Committee is anticipating a need to modify its policy in line with market norms by guaranteeing 50% of the executives' bonus for 
the year 2003/04. If fully adopted, this change in policy will modify the significant elements of its Executive Directors' remuneration 
as follows:
% of compensation
  salary 25
  annual bonus
a) Guaranteed 12.5
b) For achievement of stretching targets based on EPS and cash generation 12.5
  long-term rewards 50
(50% for achievement of stretching targets based on profit and 50% based on 
TSR when compared with a comparator group of companies)
TOTAL 100
The Company has regard to the market in determining the most appropriate levels of fixed and variable remuneration and
consideration is given to this during the annual review of remuneration. 
The policy relating to each component of remuneration is summarised below:
Short-term rewards
Annual salary
Basic salaries are set with reference to independent advice on salary levels for similar roles in other comparable companies whilst still
taking into account the position and performance of the relevant Director. The factors for comparability are based on size, market
sector and business complexity looking at each executive position independently. The Remuneration Committee resolved not to
increase the salaries of the Executive Directors for the financial year ended 30 April 2003. The Committee will review the salary of 
the Finance Director twelve months from the date of his appointment on 3 February 2003 and the remuneration for the new Chief
Executive will be determined on appointment.
David Thorpe was appointed as interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company with effect from 22 May 2003. His appointment is for a
minimum period of six months, but may be extended, by the Company, if a handover period is required to ensure an effective transfer
of responsibilities to Mr Thorpe's replacement. The Company and Mr Thorpe may agree an extension to Mr Thorpe's initial term if no
replacement has been appointed prior to the expiry of six months from the commencement of his appointment. Mr Thorpe's basic
monthly salary is  25,000. Within one month of the termination of his appointment, Mr Thorpe will be paid an additional amount
equal to the difference between his monthly salary and that of his successor, multiplied by the number of months service during which
he has served as interim Chief Executive Officer.
Benefits
Executive Directors are entitled to the provision of a car allowance or a fully expensed car, medical insurance, death and disability
allowance and reimbursement of reasonable business expenses.  Anite Group plc annual report and accounts 2003 29
Bonus
The terms of the annual incentive scheme for Executive Directors are agreed annually. The maximum potential annual bonus award 
for Executive Directors will not exceed 100% of salary. The annual incentive scheme for Executive Directors is non-contractual. Bonus
payments are subject to the achievement of performance conditions and are set by the Remuneration Committee each year. The
Executive Directors' bonus performance targets ending 30 April 2003 were completely dependent on EPS growth. The bonus potential
for the year ending 30 April 2004 will be based on the following: 70% on EPS growth and 30% on cash generation.
Long-term rewards
The Executive Directors have been awarded options under the Executive Share Option Scheme No.3 (ESOS) which was approved 
by shareholders in 1994 and the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) which was approved by shareholders in 1998. Both schemes were
amended and those amendments were approved by shareholders on 5 September 2001 and now have broadly similar rules. The ESOS
will lapse in 2004. Each Executive Director is eligible for the grant of options, the value of which may not in any financial year of the
Company exceed two times the annual remuneration of the Executive Director, save that in exceptional circumstances (as determined 
by the Remuneration Committee) this can be exceeded and options valued at up to four times remuneration can be granted, provided
that in any three consecutive financial years the aggregate value of options granted does not exceed six times remuneration. 
The Remuneration Committee has agreed to issue Mr Humphrey an option over 727,273 shares under the LTIP at the next available
opportunity. 50% of the target attached to these options will be based on a profit figure yet to be agreed and 50% will be based 
on TSR against comparator companies (see below).
The Company has established the Anite Group plc Approved Share Option Plan 2001 but no options have been granted to Executive
Directors under the plan.
Options granted up to 30 April 2003 are included in the table on page 32.
All share options are subject to stretching performance measures. For ESOS options granted before 5 September 2001 the performance
targets were based on profit growth and the target periods are now over. For LTIP options granted before 5 September 2001, the
performance target is growth in earnings per share (EPS) which is calculated, in line with standard practice, as follows:
Adjusted EPS growth over the performance period to exceed A + B + C where:
  A  is the percentage increase in RPI during the first year plus 7%;
  B  is the increase in RPI during the second year plus 7% expressed as a percentage of the base RPI; and
  C  is the increase in RPI during the third year plus 7% expressed as a percentage of the base RPI
and for each year during the Performance Period to exceed the percentage growth in RPI during that year.
For the purposes of this target:
  adjusted EPS  means, in relation to any year and in relation to any company, the headline earnings of the company (as set out 
in the Statement of Investment Practice No.1 of the institute of Investment Management and Research) for that year, expressed 
as an EPS figure calculated on a fully diluted basis; and
  base RPI  means RPI for the month immediately preceding the date of grant.
This target was chosen to demonstrate an emphasis on sustained financial growth.
For options under either scheme granted since 5 September 2001, 50% of the options granted have a performance target based on
TSR, which was chosen to reflect corporate performance relative to companies with similar characteristics and subject to similar market
conditions and to demonstrate the minimum return to shareholders required to justify the use of executive share options. The other
50% of options granted have targets based on profit growth in order to align the level of executive rewards with the financial
performance of the Company. 30 Anite Group plc annual report and accounts 2003
Report by the Board to the shareholders 
on Directors' remuneration continued
To meet the minimum TSR target, the Company must rank no lower than the median position when measured against a group of
comparator companies (see below). To achieve the maximum target the Company must rank in the upper quartile. The profit target 
for the most recent options granted on 12 October 2001 was  30m profit before tax for the financial year ended 30 April 2002. The
performance period for the profit target is the financial year in which the option is granted unless it is granted in the second half of
the financial year when the performance target is the next financial year. The performance period for the TSR target is the 12-month
period commencing with the date the option is granted. The exercise period in both cases, provided the performance targets are met,
is the period of seven years starting from the third anniversary of the date of grant. If the performance target is not met at the end of
the relevant performance period the relevant percentage of the option will lapse. There is no retesting.
TSR calculation and comparator group
For the purposes of calculating TSR, it is assumed that dividends are reinvested. The TSR of the Company and the comparator
companies is calculated by Hewitt, Bacon & Woodrow (UBS Investment Bank have supplied the raw data).
The Committee may amend the list in the comparator group if circumstances make this necessary (for example as a result of takeovers
or mergers of comparator companies). The comparator companies used for the option grant on 12 October 2001 were: Logica, CMG,
Misys and Xansa. Logica and CMG have merged since the target was set. The comparator group for 2003/04 will comprise the
following: Logica CMG, Misys, Xansa, ISOFT Group, Torex, Northgate, ITNET, Sage Group and Parity.
The Executive Directors may also participate in the Anite Group plc Savings Related Share Option Scheme. This is an Inland Revenue
approved scheme and has no performance conditions under tax legislation. The Company grants options under the SAYE to enable 
all eligible employees to benefit from long-term share price appreciation.
Pensions
The Executive Directors are required to make their own pension arrangements and the Group makes no payment in respect of this. 
Share dilution through the operation of share plans
Where shares are issued through share plans, the aggregate dilution will not exceed 15% in any ten-year period. 
External appointments
Executive Directors are not permitted to hold external directorships or offices without the approval of the Board. The Board has
previously permitted Executive Directors to retain payments from sources outside of the Company for the external directorships or
offices they currently hold. This is at the sole discretion of the Board. The Board's policy is to continue using its discretion and it will
consider each situation as it arises based on the circumstances of the Company at the time.
Directors' service contracts 
The Remuneration Committee's policy on service contracts is as follows:
All contracts will consist of one year's rolling duration. With the exception of gross misconduct, contracts will be honoured in full.
Information regarding Executive Directors' service contracts is summarised in the table below.
Executive Director Date of contract Notice period
J E Hawkins (ceased to be a Director on 22 May 2003) 3 November 1997 12 months
C J Humphrey 3 February 2003 12 months
S A Hunt (resigned 3 September 2002) 26 June 1996 24 months
D A Thorpe 22 May 2003 Fixed duration with no notice period
The contracts of Executive Directors contain a provision that sets out the compensation payable if the Company terminates the contract
(other than for cause) or the executive resigns in circumstances where there has been a material adverse change in role, responsibilities
or remuneration. Compensation is based on the provisions set out in each Director's service contract. The contract of Mr Hawkins
permitted the Company to be able to terminate the contract with 12 months' notice. The contract with Mr Humphrey permits the
Company to terminate the contract by giving 12 months' notice. The Company has the right to pay Mr Humphrey in lieu of notice 
in which case a sum of six months' salary and contractual benefits is payable within seven days of termination and the balance is 
then payable on a monthly basis but will stop if Mr Humphrey commences comparably paid employment with a new employer. 
The Company reserves the right to make payment in lieu of the notice periods set out above, together with payment in respect
of holiday entitlement accrued but not taken in the relevant year. Anite Group plc annual report and accounts 2003 31
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts. Their terms of appointment are one year and are reviewed annually by the
Board. There is no notice period or provision for compensation for loss of office. The Board also reviews Non-Executive Directors' fees
annually in the light of fees payable to Non-Executive Directors for comparability. Levels of fees are also set by reference to the
responsibilities taken by the Non-Executive Directors in chairing the Board and its committees.
