 28 ANITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004
Report on Directors' remuneration
This report is presented in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance and the Directors' Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002. The Regulations require the auditors to report on certain sections of this report only and the audited information is clearly identified.
ROLE OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE AND TERMS OF REFERENCE
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee ) operates within agreed terms of reference and determines:
 
the Company's general policy on remuneration and benefits of the Executive Directors;
 
the specific remuneration packages for the Executive Directors including, but not limited to, basic salary and benefits, together with any annual
performance-related incentives and long-term incentives; and
 
the terms and conditions of employment of the Executive Directors.
MEMBERSHIP OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
During the year, membership of the Committee was as follows:
 
Mr G S Caleb (Chairman)
 
Mr A Daly
 
Mr D A Thorpe (except 22 May to 3 November 2003)
Mr Peter Bertram was appointed as a member of the Committee with effect from 1 June 2004. Mr Thorpe has tendered his resignation as a Director
with effect from 1 August 2004.
During the year, the Committee members were considered to be independent of management and free from any business or other relationship which
could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. The Committee met four times during the year. The Executive Directors may
attend the Committee meetings by invitation and assist the Committee in its considerations, but they are not present when issues relating to their own
compensation are discussed. No Director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
During the year, the Committee consulted with the following firms of advisers:
 
Hewitt, Bacon & Woodrow - independent advisers to the Committee, who advised on total remuneration;
 
UBS Investment Bank - whose opinion was sought on aspects of the Company's remuneration proposals; and
 
Olswang - who gave general advice on matters relating to employment contracts and aspects of the Company's share option schemes. Subsequent
to the year end, Olswang ceased to provide employment and benefits advice to the Committee.
During the year, additional services were provided to the Company by Olswang, as one of the Company's legal advisers, and by UBS Investment Bank
as financial adviser.
REMUNERATION POLICY 
Principles of executive remuneration
The Company's remuneration policy is designed to attract, retain and motivate executives of a high calibre. To achieve this objective, the executive
remuneration policy is framed around the following core principles:
 
total rewards are designed to provide competitive packages within the market, taking each Director's total remuneration package as a whole;
 
incentive-based rewards are dependent upon the achievement of demanding performance conditions consistent with corporate strategy in the
short, medium and longer terms; and
 
the design of long-term incentives is prudent, and designed to support the Company's business strategy.
Elements of executive remuneration
The Committee will normally target the projected value of the significant elements of the Executive Directors' remuneration over the longer term as set
out below.
During the year, there was no change to the policy on the ratio of fixed to variable elements of the Executive Directors' remuneration. However, the
Committee has further refined the analysis by adopting the Black Scholes method of calculation. ANITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 29

2 50% for achievement of stretching targets based on profit and 50% based on total shareholder return (TSR) when compared with a comparator group of companies
However, with the critical need to appoint both a new Chief Executive and a new Finance Director in 2003 the Committee anticipated the need 
to modify its policy in line with market norms, by guaranteeing 50% of the Executive Directors' bonuses for the year 2003/04, as set out in the
Committee's report in 2003.
The Company has regard to the market in determining the most appropriate levels of fixed and variable remuneration and consideration is given to this
during the annual review of remuneration.
The policy relating to each component of remuneration is summarised below:
SHORT-TERM REWARDS
Annual salary
Basic salaries are set with reference to independent advice on salary levels for similar roles in other comparable companies, while taking into account
the Director's position and performance. The factors for comparability are based on size, market sector and business complexity, taking each Director
separately.
Benefits in kind
Executive Directors are entitled to a car allowance, medical insurance, death-in-service and permanent health insurance, local accommodation costs and
reimbursement of reasonable business expenses.
Bonus
The terms of the annual incentive scheme for Executive Directors are agreed annually. The on-target bonus is 75% of salary and the maximum
potential annual bonus award, for exceptional performance (as determined by the Committee), for Executive Directors will not exceed 100% of salary.
Bonus payments are subject to the achievement of performance conditions and are set by the Committee each year. The Executive Directors' bonus
performance targets are based 70% on EPS growth and 30% on cash balances.
EPS is measured by reference to the profit after tax of the ongoing businesses before goodwill, amortisation and exceptional items. Cash balances are
taken at the end of the financial year.
LONG-TERM REWARDS
Long-term awards comprise options granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan which was approved by shareholders in 1998 and amended by them
in 2001, and the Approved Share Option Plan which was approved by shareholders in 2001. The principles governing the Executive Directors'
participation in the plans are set out in guidelines adopted by the Committee during the year. Each Executive Director is eligible for the grant of
options, the value of which, based on the current market value of the Company's ordinary shares, may not in any financial year exceed two times the
annual remuneration of the Executive Director, save that in exceptional circumstances (as determined by the Committee) this can be exceeded and
options valued at up to four times remuneration can be granted, provided that in any three consecutive financial years the aggregate value of options
granted does not exceed six times remuneration.
Options granted up to 30 April 2004 are included in the table on pages 32 and 33.
Since 5 September 2001, 50% of the options granted under the schemes have a performance target based on TSR, which was chosen to reflect
corporate performance relative to companies with similar characteristics and subject to similar market conditions and to demonstrate the minimum
return to shareholders required to justify the use of executive share options. The remaining 50% of options granted under the schemes have targets
based on growth of profit before tax, in order to align the level of executive rewards with the financial performance of the Company. 30 ANITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004
Report on Directors' remuneration 
To meet the minimum TSR target, the Company must rank no lower than the median position when measured against a group of comparator
companies (see below). To achieve the maximum target, the Company must rank in the upper quartile.
For an option to vest, the actual profit must be no less than 80% of the target figure (the minimum profit target ). The performance period for the profit
target is the financial year in which the option is granted unless it is granted in the second half of the financial year when the performance period is the
next financial year. The performance period for the TSR target is the 12-month period beginning on the date of grant. The exercise period in both cases,
provided the performance targets are met, is the period of seven years beginning on the third anniversary of the date of grant. The performance target is
tested at the end of the relevant performance period and, subject to the achievement of the minimum profit target, the option vests on a proportionate
basis. Any unvested part of an option will lapse. There is no retesting.
TSR calculation and comparator group
For the purposes of calculating TSR, it is assumed that dividends are reinvested. TSR for the Company and the other companies in the comparator group 
is calculated by Hewitt, Bacon & Woodrow using data supplied by Datastream.
The Committee may make changes to membership of the comparator group if circumstances require, for example as a result of takeovers or mergers. The
comparator group used for the option grants on 15 July 2003 comprised: iSOFT Group plc, ITNET plc, LogicaCMG plc, Misys plc, Northgate Information
Solutions plc, Parity Group plc, The Sage Group plc, Torex plc and Xansa plc.
The comparator group for the option grants on 16 December 2003 and 23 January 2004 comprised: Alphameric PLC, Autonomy Corporation plc, AVEVA
Group plc, Axon Group plc, Computacenter plc, Detica Group plc, DICOM Group plc, Dimension Data Holdings plc, Eidos plc, Emblaze plc, Gresham
Computing plc, Intec Telecom Systems plc, iSOFT Group plc, ITNET plc, LogicaCMG plc, Marlborough Stirling plc, Misys plc, Morse plc, Northgate
Information Solutions plc, NSB Retail Systems plc, Research Machines plc, Royalblue Group plc, SurfControl plc, Synstar plc, The Innovation Group Plc,
The Sage Group plc and Xansa plc.
The Executive Directors may also participate in the Anite Group plc Savings Related Share Option Scheme (SAYE ). This is an Inland Revenue approved
scheme and has no performance conditions. The Company grants options under the scheme to enable all eligible employees to benefit from long-term
share price appreciation.
Pensions
The Executive Directors make their own pension arrangements and the Group makes no payment in respect of this.
With effect from 28 October 2003, the Committee has determined that the Executive Directors be permitted to elect to sacrifice part of their basic salary
in return for the Company making contributions to a pension fund on their behalf. During the year, no Executive Director made such an election.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
Executive Directors are not permitted to hold external directorships or offices without the approval of the Board. The Board has previously exercised its
discretion and permitted Executive Directors to retain payments from sources outside of the Company for the external directorships or offices they hold.
The Board considers each case as it arises, based on the circumstances of the Company at the time.
DIRECTORS' SERVICE CONTRACTS 
The Committee's policy is that all service contracts will be rolling contracts of one year's duration. Other than in the case of dismissal for gross
misconduct, the provisions of service contracts will be honoured in full.
Information regarding the Executive Directors' service contracts is summarised in the table below.
Executive Director Date of contract Notice period
C J Humphrey 3 February 2003 12 months
S P Rowley (appointed as a Director on 3 November 2003) 3 November 2003 12 months

The table below sets out the contractual compensation payable to Executive Directors i) if the Company terminates the contract (other than for cause)
or, ii) in the case of Mr Rowley, if he resigns in circumstances where there has been a material adverse change in role, responsibilities or remuneration.

During the year, Mr Hawkins received a severance payment for loss of office of  743,098, comprising a lump sum of  407,917, nine monthly payments
of  25,000 each in lieu of notice and a total of  110,181 in respect of salary between 22 May and 31 August 2003 (the date of his Compromise
Agreement).
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts. With the exception of Mr Bertram, who has a three-year term of office, terms of appointment 
are for one year and are reviewed annually by the Board. There is no notice period or provision for compensation for loss of office. The Board also reviews
Non-Executive Directors' fees annually, in the course of which it compares fees paid to Non-Executive Directors of comparable companies. The additional
responsibilities undertaken by the Non-Executive Directors in chairing the Board and its committees are taken into account when determining their fees.
Non-Executive Director Date of letter of appointment
A Daly 1 October 1995
P M Bertram 25 May 2004
G S Caleb 16 February 1999

ANITE GROUP PLC TOTAL RETURN INDEX VS FTSE SOFTWARE AND COMPUTER SERVICES SECTOR TOTAL RETURN INDEX FOR 
THE FIVE FINANCIAL YEARS ENDED 30 APRIL 2004
This graph shows the performance of the Company against the performance of the FTSE Software and Computer Services Sector for the five financial
years ended 30 April 2004. This sector has been chosen as representing a broad equity market index consisting of companies that are comparable 
to the Company. In drawing this graph, it has been assumed that all dividends paid have been reinvested, and share price averaging over a 30-day
period has been used to reduce the impact of short-term equity-price volatility.
