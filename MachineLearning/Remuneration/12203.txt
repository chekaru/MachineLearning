 This report has been prepared in accordance with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance and the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations
2002 (the Regulations). A resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 4 October 2005.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company's members on the auditable part of the report on Directors' remuneration and
to state whether, in their view, this part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by
the Regulations). The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.

Remuneration Committee
Membership
The Remuneration Committee is a committee of the Board and is comprised of Non-Executive Directors who are independent of management
and free from any business or other relationship which could interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
The Committee invites the Executive Directors and other senior managers to attend its meetings as appropriate, although none are involved in
discussions regarding their own remuneration.
During the year, membership of the Committee was as follows:
Peter Bertram (Chairman) appointed as a member on 1 June 2004. Appointed as Chairman of the Committee on 28 September 2004.
Graham Caleb resigned as a member and Chairman of the Committee on 28 September 2004.
Alec Daly
David Hurst-Brown appointed on 23 August 2004.
David Thorpe resigned on 1 August 2004.
Both Peter Bertram and David Hurst-Brown are considered by the Board to be independent  as defined by provision A.3.1 of the Combined
Code. Mr Bertram is the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.
In view of the fact that there was a complete change of independent Non-Executive Directors on both the Board and the Remuneration
Committee during the year, it was decided that, to ensure continuity, Mr Daly, the Chairman of the Company, should remain as a member 
of the Committee. Mr Daly will cease to be a member of the Committee when he retires as a Director at the 2005 AGM.
Meetings
The Committee met seven times during the year. Details of attendance at the meetings are shown in the table in the corporate governance
report on page 28.
Role, responsibilities and terms of reference
The principal function of the Committee is to make recommendations to the Board on the remuneration policy for Executive Directors. It is also
responsible for setting the individual remuneration packages for the Chairman, the Executive Directors and the Chief Executive's direct reports,
and for monitoring and approving all share-based incentive arrangements. The Committee also determines the terms and conditions of
employment of the Executive Directors.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference, which are posted on the Company's website.
Advice and assistance
During the year the Committee appointed New Bridge Street Consultants LLP as its professional advisers on executive remuneration and
employee share schemes. New Bridge Street Consultants provides no other services to the Company.
A statement of the relationship of New Bridge Street Consultants with the Company is available on the Company's website.
The Company Secretary (who is also the Secretary to the Committee) and the Group HR Director both provide the Committee with
information and assistance. The Chief Executive is also invited to attend Committee meetings to provide his own insights on business objectives
and the individual performance of his direct reports. Naturally, he is not present when his own remuneration is being discussed.
Executive Directors' remuneration
Main principles
The Company's objective is to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre executives who can drive the business forward and increase shareholder
value. To meet this objective, the Company follows three key principles:
 
Total rewards are designed to be competitive, with the remuneration package of each Executive Director benchmarked regularly against the market.
 
Incentive-based rewards are seen as an important part of each Executive Director's total remuneration and are designed to drive and reward
exceptional performance.
 
Long-term incentive arrangements are designed to align the interests of the Executive Directors and senior managers with those of the
shareholders and to support the Company's business strategy.
32 Anite Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2005
Report on Directors' remuneration Reward structure
The Executive Directors' total remuneration packages consist of:
 
Base salary.
 
Annual performance bonus.
 
Long-term incentive arrangements.
 
Other benefits and allowances.
The Executive Directors make their own pension arrangements and the Group makes no payment in this respect.
Base salary
Base salary is set with reference to independent advice on salary levels for similar roles in other comparable companies in the Software and
Computer Services sector and the market generally. The factors for comparability are based on market sector, size and business complexity.
Final recommendations will also reflect overall individual performance.
Annual performance bonus
The terms of the annual incentive bonus scheme for Executive Directors are agreed annually. Performance targets for the financial year 
ended 30 April 2005 are based totally on EPS growth. On target  performance (which involves achieving demanding targets) under the plan
rules may deliver up to 75% of base salary. For exceptional performance (as determined by the Remuneration Committee) payment of up to
100% of base salary may be made.
The Committee will take external advice on the effects of the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards, on the performance
conditions applying to the annual bonus and any other incentive award.
Long-term incentive arrangements
Until recently the long-term incentive arrangements operated by the Company for Executive Directors comprised:
 
Executive options granted under the Approved Share Option Plan (approved by shareholders in 2001).
 
Executive options granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan (approved by shareholders in 1998 and amended by shareholder approval 
in 2001).
The maximum limit for option grants under these plans was 200% of remuneration per annum, although this maximum could be exceeded 
in exceptional circumstances up to 400% per annum (subject to an overall maximum of 600% of remuneration in three years).
For the Executive Directors, the performance conditions governing the exercise of options were based 50% on Group profit targets and 50% 
on the Company's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance relative to a comparator group of other Software and Computer Services sector
companies. For both elements, performance was measured over a one-year period, although the options were not exercisable until three years
from grant. To meet the minimum TSR target, the Company must rank no lower than the median position when measured against the group 
of comparator companies. To achieve the maximum target, the Company must rank in the upper quartile. In order for the profit-related half of
the options to vest, the actual profit must be no less than 80% of the target, at which point 80% of these options will vest, with straight-line
vesting through to 100% where the target is achieved in full. There is no further testing, and any unvested options lapse.
On 26 April 2005, recognising that the existing option schemes are not compliant with current best practice, the Company held an
Extraordinary General Meeting at which the shareholders approved the introduction of two new long-term share-based incentive plans,
as follows:
 
Performance Share Plan (PSP).
 
Share Matching Plan (SMP).
It is intended that these new plans will now be the only executive incentive arrangements under which share-based awards will be made.
The Committee will consult with the Company's major shareholders before any further options are granted to senior executives under the
Approved Share Option Plan and the Long Term Incentive Plan (unless circumstances make it inappropriate to do so). If granted, those options
will be made subject to performance conditions that take account of best and market practice prevailing at the time.
Under the PSP an individual may receive an award over shares worth up to 100% of salary per annum (although in exceptional circumstances
an award of up to 200% of salary may be made). The awards will be made as conditional awards of free shares.
The Executive Directors and a small number of the most senior executives will also be able to participate in the SMP. This will allow them 
to lodge in the SMP shares worth up to 30% per annum of base salary, which will then be matched on a two for one (gross) basis.
Anite Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2005 33 The awards will be subject to three-year performance conditions. The first awards made under the plans will be subject to a TSR performance
condition which will measure the Company's TSR performance against a comparator group comprising the constituents of the FTSE All-Share
Software and Computer Services sector over a single three-year performance period commencing on the first day of the financial year in which
the award is made. 25% of the award will vest if the Company is ranked at the median at the end of the performance period, with 100% of the
award vesting if the Company is at or above the upper quartile (with straight-line vesting in between). However, before any awards vest, the
Committee must have satisfied itself that the Company's underlying financial performance over the performance period warrants the level of
vesting determined by reference to the TSR performance condition.
The performance condition was chosen as it encourages Executive Directors to generate outstanding returns to shareholders as compared with
the Company's sector peers. The extent to which the performance condition is satisfied will be calculated by external consultants to ensure the
appropriate level of third-party verification.
To provide a further alignment of interest with shareholders, the Executive Directors and others participating in the SMP will be required to
retain in shares an amount equal in value to 50% of the after-tax gain made on the vesting of awards until they have built up a shareholding
equal to 100% of base salary.
It is anticipated that the first awards under the PSP and SMP will be made in July 2005, following the preliminary announcement of the full-
year results. The Committee intends to make an initial grant under the PSP to Steve Rowley, the Chief Executive, in excess of the normal 100%
of salary limit. This is because as part of Mr Rowley's recruitment package, it was agreed that he would be granted options under the existing
option schemes worth 400% of salary, on or shortly after joining the Company. In the event, he has only been granted options over shares
worth 200% of salary. However, rather than grant him a further 200% of salary's worth of options under the existing option schemes, the
Committee proposes to grant Mr Rowley an enhanced first award under the PSP over shares worth 200% of salary. The size of this grant will
reflect both (i) the grant that Mr Rowley would normally receive under the PSP and (ii) an enhanced grant which is of an equivalent expected
value  to the options that he would otherwise be entitled to receive.
Detailed information on the two plans was set out in a circular and notice of meeting sent to shareholders on 8 April 2005, which is available
on the Company's website.
The Executive Directors also participate in the Savings Related Share Option Scheme. There was no invitation under this scheme in the current
year and it is not anticipated that any further invitations will be made, as the Company plans to offer a matching share element under the Share
Incentive Plan (SIP) as the share-based incentive arrangement for all employees. The Executive Directors will be able to participate in the SIP.
Share dilution through operation of the share plans
The use of new issue or treasury shares to satisfy awards made under the share plans is subject to a 15% dilution limit in any ten-year period.
However, the Company recognises that its shareholders wish this limit to be reduced, and the Remuneration Committee intends to achieve this
as soon as it is appropriate to do so.
Other benefits and allowances
Executive Directors are entitled to a car allowance, fuel, medical insurance, death-in-service and permanent health insurance, together with
reimbursement of reasonable business expenses.
Service contracts
The Committee's policy is that all Executive Directors' service contracts will be rolling contracts of one year's duration. Other than in the case
of dismissal for gross misconduct, the provisions of service contracts will be honoured in full.
Information regarding the Executive Directors' service contracts is summarised in the table below.
Executive Director Date of contract Notice period

Executive Directors are not permitted to hold external directorships or offices without the approval of the Board. The fees received by Executive
Directors in respect of their service on outside Boards are not disclosed, since this information is not considered relevant to Anite.
The table below sets out the rights the Company has to pay Executive Directors in lieu of notice together with the contractual compensation
payable to Executive Directors if the Company terminates the contract (other than for cause) without notice.

1 Contractual benefits include the annual performance bonus the Executive Director would have received had he continued to be employed from the date of termination until the 
expiry of the notice period.
2 Payments cease, in effect, if the Executive Director commences employment with a new employer during the payment period.
34 Anite Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2005
Report on Directors' remuneration continued Furthermore, for a period of six months following a change in control of the Company, Steve Rowley may terminate his employment on 
28 days' notice at which point he will be entitled to the same payments as set out in the table above (which, as can be seen, shall not exceed
12 months' remuneration).
The Company is aware of the provisions in the Combined Code which state that compensation payments should reflect a departing Director's
obligation to mitigate his loss. However, the Company has adopted the above described approach to determining the compensation that is
payable in the event that an Executive Director's service contract is terminated as it believes that it is in shareholders' interests that the
obligations of each party in such circumstances are transparent and agreed in advance to provide certainty.

If the Company terminates an Executive Director's employment without cause, pursuant to the terms of their service contracts, the Company
will recommend that the Remuneration Committee exercises any discretion it has under the terms of any share incentive plans in favour 
of the departing Executive Director. If the Remuneration Committee determines not to follow this recommendation, the departing Executive
Director shall be entitled to damages.
Non-Executive Directors
Mr Bertram and Mr Hurst-Brown each have a three-year term of office. Mr Daly does not have a service contract. There is no notice period 
or provision for compensation for loss of office.
The Board reviews the independent Non-Executive Directors' fees annually, in the course of which it compares fees paid to Non-Executive
Directors of comparable companies. Fees recognise the additional responsibilities undertaken by the Non-Executive Directors in chairing the
Board and its committees.
The Chairman's fees are set by the Remuneration Committee. As previously explained, Mr Daly is currently a member of the Committee,
although this will cease upon his retirement as a Director at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Naturally, Mr Daly is not present at any
discussion of his own remuneration.
