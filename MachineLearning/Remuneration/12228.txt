 Anite Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2006   
34
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance and the Directors' Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002 (the Regulations ). A resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 
3 October 2006.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company's members on the auditable part of the report on Directors' remuneration and
to state whether, in their view, this part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended 
by the Regulations). The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.

Remuneration Committee
Membership
The Remuneration Committee is a committee of the Board and is comprised of Non-Executive Directors who are independent of management
and free from any business or other relationship which could interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
During the year, membership of the Committee was as follows:
Peter Bertram (Chairman)
Alec Daly retired on 4 October 2005
David Hurst-Brown
Both Peter Bertram and David Hurst-Brown are considered by the Board to be independent  as defined by Provision A.3.1 of the Combined
Code. Mr Bertram is the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.
Alec Daly, the former Chairman of the Company, ceased to be a member of the Committee when he retired as a Director at the 2005 AGM.
His successor as Chairman, Clay Brendish, is not a member of the Committee, and attends meetings by invitation only.
The Committee also invites the Executive Directors and other senior managers to attend its meetings as appropriate.
Meetings
The Committee met five times during the year. Details of attendance at the meetings are shown in the table in the corporate governance
report on page 27.
Role, responsibilities and terms of reference
The principal function of the Committee is to make recommendations to the Board on the remuneration policy for Executive Directors. It is
also responsible for setting the individual remuneration packages for the Chairman, the Executive Directors and the Chief Executive's direct
reports, and for monitoring and approving all share-based incentive arrangements. The Committee also determines the terms and conditions 
of employment of the Executive Directors.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference, which are posted on the Company's website.
Advice and assistance
During the year the Committee used New Bridge Street Consultants LLP as its professional advisers on executive remuneration and employee
share schemes. New Bridge Street Consultants provide no other services to the Company.
A statement of the relationship of New Bridge Street Consultants with the Company is available on the Company's website.
The Company Secretary (who is also the Secretary to the Committee) and the Group HR Director both provide the Committee with
information and assistance. The Chief Executive regularly attends Committee meetings to provide his own insights on business objectives 
and the individual performance of his direct reports. He is not present when his own remuneration is being discussed.
Executive Directors' remuneration
Main principles
The Company's objective is to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre executives who can drive the business forward and increase 
shareholder value. To meet this objective, the Company follows three key principles:
 
Total rewards are designed to be competitive, with the remuneration package of each Executive Director benchmarked regularly against the
market.
 
Incentive-based rewards are seen as an important part of each Executive Director's total remuneration and are designed to drive and
reward exceptional performance.
 
Long-term incentive arrangements are designed to align the interests of the Executive Directors and senior managers with those of the
shareholders and to support the Company's business strategy.

Reward structure
The Executive Directors' total remuneration packages consist of:
 
Base salary.
 
Annual performance bonus.
 
Long-term incentive arrangements.
 
Other benefits and allowances.
The Executive Directors make their own pension arrangements and the Group makes no payment in this respect.
Base salary
Base salary is set with reference to independent advice on salary levels for similar roles in other comparable companies in the software and
computer services sector and the market generally. The factors for comparability are based on market sector, size and business complexity.
Annual performance bonus
The terms of the annual incentive bonus for Executive Directors are agreed annually. 2005/06 was a transitional year as the Group moved 
to IFRS. In order for the Executive Directors to achieve 75% of base salary as a bonus a growth rate of 20% in adjusted EPS pre-tax was
required. Adjusted EPS represented profit before tax and before the utilisation of onerous contract provisions. For exceptional performance 
(as determined by the Remuneration Committee), payment of up to 100% of base salary may be made. In view of the underlying business
performance and following the resolution of the SoV contract, the Remuneration Committee has exercised its discretion in awarding this year's
Executive Directors' bonuses.
Long-term incentive arrangements
Until April 2005 the long-term incentive arrangements operated by the Company for Executive Directors comprised:
 
Executive options granted under the Approved Share Option Plan (approved by shareholders in 2001).
 
Executive options granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (approved by shareholders in 1998 and amended by shareholder approval 
in 2001).
For the Executive Directors, the performance conditions governing the exercise of options were based 50% on Group profit targets and 50%
on the Company's total shareholder return (TSR ) performance relative to a comparator group of other software and computer services sector
companies. For both elements, performance was measured over a one year period, although the options were not exercisable until three years
from grant. To meet the minimum TSR target, the Company had to rank no lower than the median position when measured against the
comparator group. To achieve the maximum target, the Company needed to rank in the upper quartile. In order for the profit-related half of
the options to vest, the actual profit had to be no less than 80% of the target, at which point 80% of these options would vest, with straight-
line vesting through to 100% where the target was achieved in full. There was no further testing, and any unvested options lapsed.
In April 2005, recognising that these option schemes were not compliant with current best practice, the Company introduced the following
two long-term share-based incentive plans:
 
The Performance Share Plan (PSP ).
 
The Share Matching Plan (SMP ).
It is intended that these new plans will now be the only executive incentive arrangements under which share-based awards will be made.
The Committee will consult with the Company's major shareholders before any further options are granted to senior executives under the
Approved Share Option Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan (unless circumstances make it inappropriate to do so). If granted, those options
will be made subject to performance conditions that take account of best and market practice prevailing at the time.
Under the PSP an individual may receive an award of shares worth up to 100% of salary per annum (although in exceptional circumstances 
an award of up to 200% of salary may be made). The awards are made as conditional awards of free shares.
The Executive Directors and a small number of the most senior executives are also able to participate in the SMP. This allows them to lodge 
in the SMP shares worth up to 30% per annum of base salary, which are then matched on a two for one (gross) basis.
The awards are subject to three year performance conditions. The awards made so far under the plans have been subject to a TSR performance
condition which will measure the Company's TSR performance against a comparator group comprising the constituents of the FTSE All-Share
software and computer services sector over a single three year performance period commencing on the first day of the financial year in which
the award is made. 25% of the award will vest if the Company is ranked at the median at the end of the performance period, with 100% of
the award vesting if the Company is at or above the upper quartile (with straight-line vesting in between). However, before any awards vest,
the Committee must have satisfied itself that the Company's underlying financial performance over the performance period warrants the level
of vesting determined by reference to the TSR performance condition.
This performance condition was chosen as it encourages Executive Directors to generate outstanding returns to shareholders as compared with
the Company's sector peers. The extent to which the performance condition is satisfied will be calculated by external consultants to ensure the
appropriate level of third-party verification.

To provide a further alignment of interest with shareholders, the Executive Directors and others participating in the SMP are required to retain
in shares an amount equal in value to 50% of the after-tax gain made on the vesting of awards until they have built up a shareholding equal
to 100% of base salary.
The first awards under the PSP and SMP were made in July 2005, following the preliminary announcement of the full-year results. Mr Rowley
received an enhanced first award under the PSP over shares worth 200% of salary. This was because as part of his recruitment package,
it had been agreed that he would be granted options under the existing option schemes worth 400% of salary, on or shortly after joining 
the Company. In the event, he had only been granted options over shares worth 200% of salary. Therefore, the enhanced award reflected 
both (i) the grant that Mr Rowley would normally have received under the PSP and (ii) an enhanced grant which was of an equivalent
expected value  to the options he would otherwise have been entitled to receive.
The Executive Directors also participate in the Savings Related Share Option Scheme and the Share Incentive Plan.
The use of new issue or treasury shares to satisfy awards made under the share plans is subject to a 15% dilution limit in any ten year period.
However, in line with its commitment to reduce this limit, the Remuneration Committee is working under an informal dilution limit of 12.5%.

Other benefits and allowances
Executive Directors are entitled to a car allowance, fuel, medical insurance, death-in-service and permanent health insurance, together with
reasonable business expenses.
Service contracts
The Committee's policy is that all Executive Directors' service contracts will be rolling contracts of one year's duration. Other than in the case
of dismissal for gross misconduct, the provisions of service contracts will be honoured in full.
Information regarding the Executive Directors' service contracts is summarised in the table below.
Executive Director Date of contract Notice period

28 days' notice at which point he will be entitled to the same payments as set out in the table above (which, as can be seen, shall not exceed
12 months' remuneration).

The Company is aware of the provisions in the Combined Code which state that compensation payments should reflect a departing Director's
obligation to mitigate his loss. However, the Company has adopted the above described approach to determining the compensation that is
payable in the event that an Executive Director's service contract is terminated as it believes that it is in shareholders' interests that the
obligations of each party in such circumstances are transparent and agreed in advance to provide certainty.

If the Company terminates an Executive Director's employment without cause, pursuant to the terms of their service contracts, the Company
will recommend that the Remuneration Committee exercises any discretion it has under the terms of any share incentive plans in favour of
the departing Executive Director. If the Remuneration Committee determines not to follow this recommendation, the departing Executive
Director shall be entitled to damages.
Non-Executive Directors
Mr Brendish has a three year term of office with six months' notice of termination required by either party. Mr Bertram and Mr Hurst-Brown
each have a three year term of office with no notice period or provision for compensation for loss of office.
The Board reviews the independent Non-Executive Directors' fees annually, in the course of which it compares fees paid to Non-Executive
Directors of comparable companies. Fees recognise the additional responsibilities undertaken by the Non-Executive Directors in chairing the
Board and its committees.
The Chairman's fees are set by the Remuneration Committee. As previously explained, Mr Brendish is not a member of the Committee, and
attends its meetings by invitation only. Mr Brendish is not present at any discussion of his own remuneration.
