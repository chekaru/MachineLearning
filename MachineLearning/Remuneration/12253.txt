Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a committee of the Board and is comprised of Non-Executive Directors who are independent 
of management and free from any business or other relationship which could interfere with the exercise of their independent
judgement.
Chairmanship of the Committee passed to David Hurst-Brown, from Peter Bertram, on 26 April 2007. Mr Brendish was also
appointed as a member of the Committee on 26 April 2007, in line with the revision to the Combined Code.
During the year, membership of the Committee was as follows:
David Hurst-Brown (appointed as Chairman 26 April 2007)
Peter Bertram
Clay Brendish (appointed 26 April 2007)
Peter Bertram, David Hurst-Brown and Clay Brendish are considered by the Board to be independent. Mr Bertram is the Senior
Independent Non-Executive Director.
The Committee invites the Executive Directors and other senior managers to attend its meetings as appropriate. The Committee
met eight times during the year. Details of attendance at the meetings are shown in the table in the corporate governance report
on page 27.
The principal function of the Committee is to make recommendations to the Board on the remuneration policy for Executive
Directors. It is also responsible for setting the individual remuneration packages for the Chairman, the Executive Directors and 
the Chief Executive's direct reports, and for monitoring and approving all share-based incentive arrangements. The Committee 
also determines the terms and conditions of employment of the executive directors.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference, which are posted on the Company's website.
Advice and assistance
The Committee uses New Bridge Street Consultants LLP as its professional advisers on executive remuneration and employee
share schemes. New Bridge Street Consultants provide no other services to the Company. During the year, the Company also
requested Deloitte & Touche LLP to provide a market analysis of the range of available incentive arrangements.
The Company Secretary (who is also the Secretary to the Committee) and the Group Human Resources Director provide the
Committee with information and assistance. The Chief Executive regularly attends Committee meetings to provide his own
insights on business objectives and the individual performance of his direct reports. No Director or senior manager is present
when their own remuneration is being discussed.
Remuneration policy
Main principles
The Company's objective is to attract, retain and incentivise high-calibre executives who can drive the business forward and
increase shareholder value. To meet this objective, the Company follows three key principles:
> Total rewards are designed to be competitive, with the remuneration package of each Executive Director benchmarked
regularly against the market.
> Incentive-based rewards are seen as an important part of each Executive Director's total remuneration and are designed 
to drive and reward exceptional performance.
> Long-term incentive arrangements are designed to align the interests of the Executive Directors and senior managers with
those of the shareholders and to support the Company's business strategy.
Reward structure
The Executive Directors' total remuneration packages consist of:
> Base salary.
> Annual performance bonus.
> Long-term incentive arrangements.
> Other benefits and allowances.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Management and governance
Remuneration report
Anite Group plc
The Executive Directors make their own pension arrangements and the Group makes no payment in this respect.
Base salary
Base salary is set with reference to salary levels for similar roles in other comparable companies in the software and computer
services sector and the market generally. The factors for comparability are based on market sector, size and business complexity.
Annual performance bonus
The Executive Directors participate in an annual bonus plan. If stretching targets are achieved, participants receive a cash bonus of
up to 75% of salary. For exceptional performance (as determined by the Remuneration Committee), payment of a further 25% of
base salary may be made. The targets used for determining the amount of bonus payable are a combination of stretching business
performance targets and the assessment of an individual's performance during the year. Details of bonus plan awards for the year
ended 30 April 2007 are included in the table of Directors emoluments on page 35.
The Company intends to implement a new annual bonus plan for Executive Directors with effect from 1 May 2007. The terms 
of the new bonus plan are currently being finalised and full disclosure will be made in the Committee's report in 2008.
Long-term incentive arrangements
The Company operates the following two long-term share-based incentive plans both of which were approved by shareholders 
in 2005:
> The Performance Share Plan (PSP ).
> The Share Matching Plan (SMP ).
Under the PSP an individual may receive an award of shares worth up to 100% of salary per annum (although in exceptional
circumstances an award of up to 200% of salary may be made). The awards are made as conditional awards of free shares.
The Executive Directors and a small number of the most senior executives are also able to participate in the SMP. This currently
allows them to lodge in the SMP shares worth up to 30% per annum of base salary, which are then matched on a two for one
(gross) basis.
The awards are subject to three-year performance conditions. The awards made so far under the plans have been subject to 
a total shareholder return (TSR ) performance condition which measures the Company's TSR performance against a comparator
group comprising the constituents of the FTSE All-Share software and computer services sector over a single three-year
performance period commencing on the first day of the financial year in which the award is made. 25% of the award will vest 
if the Company is ranked at the median at the end of the performance period, with 100% of the award vesting if the Company 
is at or above the upper quartile (with straight-line vesting in between). However, before any awards vest, the Committee must
have satisfied itself that the Company's underlying financial performance over the performance period warrants the level of
vesting determined by reference to the TSR performance condition.
The extent to which the performance condition is satisfied will be calculated by external consultants to ensure the appropriate
level of third-party verification.
To provide a further alignment of interest with shareholders, the Executive Directors and others participating in the SMP are
required to retain in shares an amount equal in value to 50% of the after-tax gain made on the vesting of awards until they 
have built up a shareholding equal to 100% of base salary.
The Committee has recently reviewed the operation of the PSP and SMP and is proposing to make several changes to these plans.
Details of these changes are contained in the AGM Notice that has been circulated to shareholders.
The Executive Directors also participate in the Savings Related Share Option Scheme and the Share Incentive Plan. 
The use of new issue or treasury shares to satisfy awards made under the share plans is subject to a 15% dilution limit in any
ten-year period. The current potential dilution is below this level. The Committee, aware of shareholders' views in connection with
this issue, continues to take active steps to control the dilutive affect of the Company's share incentives and is currently working
under an informal dilution limit of 13%.

Other benefits and allowances
Executive Directors are entitled to a car allowance, fuel, medical insurance, death-in-service and permanent health insurance,
together with reasonable business expenses.
Other share plans
Following the acquisition of Anite Finland Limited (formerly Nemo Technologies Ltd) on 30 November 2006, the Company
introduced a Management Incentive Plan (MIP ) for key employees. The MIP is not available to Executive Directors and all awards
are settled using market purchase shares or a cash equivalent. Further details of the MIP are contained in note 7 on page 60.
Service contracts
The Committee's policy is that all Executive Directors' service contracts will be rolling contracts of one year's duration. Other than
in the case of dismissal for gross misconduct, the provisions of service contracts will be honoured in full. Information regarding the
Executive Directors' service contracts is summarised in the table below.
Executive Director Date of contract Notice period
Christopher Humphrey 3 February 2003 12 months
Steve Rowley 3 November 2003 12 months
Executive Directors are not permitted to hold external non-executive directorships or offices without the approval of the Board.
No Executive Director received any fees in respect of any external non-executive directorship that they have held during the year.
The table below sets out the rights the Company has to pay Executive Directors in lieu of notice together with the contractual
compensation payable if the Company terminates the contract (other than for cause) without notice.

1 Contractual benefits include the annual performance bonus the Executive Director would have received had he continued to be employed from the date of termination
until the expiry of the notice period.
2 Payments cease, in effect, if the executive director commences employment with a new employer during the payment period.
Furthermore, for a period of six months following a change of control in the Company, Steve Rowley may terminate his employment
on 28 days' notice at which point he will be entitled to the same payments as set out in the table above (which, as can be seen,
shall not exceed 12 months' remuneration).
The Company is aware of the provisions in the Combined Code which state that compensation payments should reflect a departing
Director's obligation to mitigate his loss. However, the Company has adopted the above described approach to determining 
the compensation that is payable in the event that an Executive Director's service contract is terminated as it believes that 
it is in shareholders' interests that the obligations of each party in such circumstances are transparent and agreed in advance
to provide certainty.

Remuneration report
Anite Group plc
If the Company terminates an Executive Director's employment without cause, the Remuneration Committee will be asked to
exercise any discretion it has under the terms of any share incentive plans in favour of the departing Executive Director. If the
Remuneration Committee determines not to follow this recommendation, the departing Executive Director shall be entitled
to damages.
Non-Executive Directors
Clay Brendish has a three-year term of office with six months' notice of termination required by either party. Peter Bertram and
David Hurst-Brown each have a three-year term of office with no notice period or provision for compensation for loss of office.
The Board reviews the Independent Non-Executive Directors' fees annually, in the course of which it compares fees paid 
to Non-Executive Directors of comparable companies. Fees recognise the additional responsibilities undertaken by the
Non-Executive Directors in chairing the Board and its Committees. In addition to their fees, the Non-Executive Directors 
are entitled to reimbursement of reasonable business expenses.
The Chairman's fees are set by the Remuneration Committee. He is not present at any discussion of his own remuneration.
