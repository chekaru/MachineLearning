Management and governance
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and associated legislation and meets the relevant requirements 
of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. As required by the relevant legislation, a resolution to approve the report will be 
proposed at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company at which the financial statements will be presented for approval.
The relevant legislation requires the independent auditors to report to the Company's shareholders on certain specified matters and this 
report has, therefore, been split into separate sections for the unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a committee of the Board and comprises the Non-Executive Directors who are independent of 
management and free from any business or other relationship which could interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.  
The Company Chairman (who was independent on appointment) is also a member.
During the year, membership of the Committee was as follows: David Hurst-Brown (Chairman of the Committee); Peter Bertram  
(resigned 8 December 2009), Clay Brendish, Nigel Clifford and Paul Taylor (appointed 5 October 2009). 
The Committee met five times during the year. Details of attendance at the meetings are shown in the table in the corporate governance 
report on page 27.
The principal function of the Committee is to make recommendations to the Board on the remuneration policy for Executive Directors. It is 
also responsible for setting the individual remuneration packages for the Chairman (in his absence), the Executive Directors and the Chief 
Executive's direct reports, and for monitoring and approving the operation of all share-based incentive arrangements. The Committee also 
determines the terms and conditions of employment of the Executive Directors.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference which are posted on the Company's website.
Advice and assistance
The Committee uses Hewitt New Bridge Street as its professional advisers on executive remuneration and employee share schemes.  
Neither Hewitt New Bridge Street nor its parent company, Hewitt Associates, provide any other services to the Company.
The Finance Director provides the Committee with information and assistance but does not generally attend meetings. The Chief Executive 
does regularly attend meetings to provide his insights on business objectives, the individual performance of his direct reports and pay and 
conditions throughout the Group. No Executive Director or senior manager is, however, present when their own remuneration is being 
specifically discussed.
Remuneration policy
Main principles
The Company's objective is to attract, retain and incentivise high-calibre executives who can drive the business forward and increase 
shareholder value. To meet this objective, the Company follows three key principles:
>  total rewards are designed to be competitive, with the remuneration package of each Executive Director and their direct reports 
benchmarked regularly against the market;
>  incentive-based rewards are seen as an important part of each Executive Director's total remuneration and are designed to drive and 
reward exceptional performance; and
>  long-term incentive arrangements are designed to align the interests of the Executive Directors and senior managers with those of the 
shareholders and to support the Company's business strategy.
The Committee also ensures that, when determining the Executive Directors' remuneration packages, due account is taken of pay and 
employment elsewhere in the Group. In this regard, the Committee ensures (via regular interaction with the Company's HR function and  
the Chief Executive's attendance at certain meetings) that it is kept fully abreast of all relevant Group-wide remuneration-related issues. 
There were no increases in base salary levels awarded to the Executive Directors for the year commencing 1 May 2010 compared with 
broadly inflationary increases for the workforce at large.
The Committee will ensure that the incentive structures for Executive Directors and senior managers will not raise environmental, social or 
governance (ESG) risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. More generally, with regard to overall remuneration structures, 
there is no restriction on the Committee which prevents it from taking into account ESG matters, nor do these remuneration structures 
encourage inappropriate operational risk taking.
Reward structure
The Executive Directors' total remuneration packages consist of:
>  base salary;
>  annual performance bonus;
>  pension contributions;
>  other benefits and allowances; and
>  long-term incentive arrangements.
 Remuneration report  32     Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010
Management and governance
Base salary
Base salary is reviewed annually and is set with reference to salary levels for similar roles in other comparable companies in the software 
and computer services sector and the market generally. The factors for comparability include market sector, size and business complexity.
As stated above, there were no increases to the base salaries of the Executive Directors for the year commencing 1 May 2010.
Annual performance bonus
The Company operates an Annual Bonus Plan (the Plan) for Executive Directors. Under the terms of the Plan for year ended 30 April 2011, 
a bonus of up to 125% of salary can be earned (year ended 30 April 2010: 100%). For the year under review, bonuses were determined 
by performance against (i) a sliding scale of challenging Group profit targets (calculated excluding fair value write-downs, amortisation 
of acquired business, gains or losses on business disposals and deduction of share-based payments) (ii) pre-agreed stretching personal 
objectives, and (iii) delivery of key strategic business objectives.
In reviewing the performance of the whole year, the Committee made no annual bonus payment to Christopher Humphrey as minimum 
profit targets were not achieved. In the case of Richard Amos, the Committee has awarded a bonus of  23,125 reflecting his performance 
against stretching personal objectives. His award has been pro-rated to reflect his employment for six months of the financial year.
For the financial year 2010/11 the Plan will be based on the achievement of profit growth targets. Achievement of budgeted profitability 
will entitle the participant to a bonus of 25% of base salary, with stretching targets above this required to be met for the maximum 100% 
of base salary that is applicable to this element of the bonus to be paid. In addition, up to a further 25% of base salary is payable for the 
achievement of personal objectives although, for such payments to be made, a minimum level of profit growth must be achieved. This 
change in policy, which enhances the performance-related element of the Executive Directors' packages, is regarded as appropriate due to 
the stage of the Group's evolution and the importance of returning the Group to a growth plan. Reflecting the higher available maximum 
payment, the percentage of base salary attributable to budgeted performance has been decreased from 75% in 2009 to 50% in 2010/11, 
with a 50% of salary bonus payable only for full achievement of the challenging personal objectives.
Pension contributions
Christopher Humphrey makes his own pension arrangements and the Group makes no payment in this respect. Richard Amos belongs to the 
Anite Stakeholder Pension Plan and the Company contributes 5% of his base salary on the basis that he contributes a minimum of 3%.
Other benefits and allowances
Executive Directors are entitled to a car allowance, fuel, medical insurance, death-in-service and permanent health insurance, together with 
reasonable business expenses.
Long-term incentive arrangements
The Company operates the following two long-term share-based incentive plans for Executive Directors:
>  the Performance Share Plan (PSP); and
>  the Share Matching Plan (SMP).
Under the PSP an individual may receive an award of shares worth up to 100% of their salary per annum (although in exceptional 
circumstances an award of up to 200% of their salary may be made). 
The Executive Directors and a small number of the most senior executives are also able to participate in the SMP. As originally structured, 
participants were allowed to lodge in the SMP shares worth up to 30% per annum of base salary, which were then matched on a two-for-
one (gross) basis.
In 2007, shareholders approved a change to the investment level under the SMP. Pursuant to this change, while the effective average annual 
level of co-investment in the SMP remained unchanged at 30% per annum, executives were provided with an opportunity over the three 
financial years from 1 May 2007 to 30 April 2010 to invest a higher amount annually (up to 90% of base salary) in the SMP. Any investment 
is, however, subject to the effective current overall aggregate limit of 90% of salary over this three-year period. The original two-for-one 
gross matching ratio was retained. A proposal is being made to this year's AGM to, in essence, repeat the approval of the higher 90% annual 
limit, again subject to the overall three-year limit. Further details of the proposal are set out in the Notice of AGM.
Awards granted under the PSP and SMP are subject to three-year performance conditions. 
The PSP and SMP awards made in 2007, 2008 and 2009 are subject to the following performance conditions:
>  half of awards are subject to a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) target. This is measured relative to the FTSE All-Share Software and 
Computer Services Sector, with 25% of this portion of awards vesting at the median and full vesting at the upper quartile. Straight-line 
vesting applies between these points; and
>  half of awards are assessed by reference to Anite's Earnings Per Share (EPS) performance. For compound annual EPS growth of at least 
RPI plus 4% per annum, 25% of awards subject to this part of the condition will vest and, for full vesting, compound annual EPS growth 
must be at least RPI plus 12% per annum. Straight-line vesting applies between these points.
 Remuneration report  continued Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010     33
The EPS figure used for PSP and SMP measurement in 2007 was 5.2p, being basic EPS before amortisation of acquired intangible assets, 
gains and losses on the disposal of operations, the effect of net capitalisation/net amortisation on research and development costs, results 
from discontinued/disposed operations and share-based payments.
The TSR and EPS performance against the 2007 targets was in both cases below the threshold performance level, so these awards will lapse 
at the end of the three-year vesting period, on the third anniversary of the grant.
The EPS figure for the measurement for PSP awards made in 2008 was 3.3p being profit from continuing businesses before disposed 
businesses, other gains and losses, share-based payments, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and restructuring costs. 
The EPS figure for the measurement for PSP awards made in 2009 was 4.4p being profit from continuing businesses before disposed 
businesses, other gains and losses, share-based payments, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and restructuring costs. 
In addition to the TSR targets, before any awards vest, the Committee must also have satisfied itself that the Company's underlying  
financial performance over the performance period warrants the level of vesting determined by reference to the TSR performance condition 
(this underpin does not apply to the EPS element). The extent to which the performance condition is satisfied will be calculated by external 
consultants to ensure the appropriate level of third-party verification.
The Committee will continue regularly to review the operation of the Company's share incentive arrangements to ensure that they take 
due account of market practice and the particular circumstances of the Company. In this regard, the Committee has determined that the 
following performance conditions should apply to PSP and SMP awards made in the forthcoming year:
>  half of an award will continue to be based on the Company's relative TSR compared with the FTSE All Share Software and Computer 
Services Sector, as is currently the case; and
>  half of an award will be based on the adjusted Profit Before Interest and Tax performance of the Wireless division (PBIT target).  
The PBIT target will primarily measure the aggregate PBIT of the Wireless division (which comprises the Handset Testing and Network 
Testing businesses) over a three-year period, but will also include an element which will reward specifically in the event of the Wireless 
division exceeding its best ever year of PBIT. The split of the PBIT target will therefore be:
 1.  75% (i.e. 37.5% of the total grant) based on the sum of the PBIT of the Wireless division in each of the three financial years of the 
performance period will count towards the vesting percentage. The following vesting schedule will apply to this part of the award:
Total PBIT of Wireless division for 2011, 2012 and 2013 Proportion of the 75% of the PBIT target which vests
Less than  42.5 million 0%
 42.5 million 25% (i.e. 18.75% of the PBIT awards)
Between  42.5 million and  50 million Pro rata from 25% to 100% (i.e. 18.75%  
 to 75% of the PBIT awards)
 50 million or above 100% (i.e. 75% of the PBIT awards)
 2.  25% (i.e. 12.5% of the total grant) will be paid if, in any one year of the performance period, the PBIT of the Wireless division is in excess 
of  23.4 million (which was the sum of the record years of PBIT the Handset Testing and Network Testing businesses achieved in 
2007 and 2009 respectively). For the purposes of making this assessment, a constant currency will be used (note that constant 
currency will not apply to the aggregate target).
  Note that measures (1) and (2) above will be assessed independently of each other. In addition, these are both independent of the TSR 
target which will continue to apply to half of all awards.
  In the event that acquisitions or disposals are made during the three-year period, the Committee will, with appropriate financial advice, 
make adjustments to the PBIT target. Furthermore, the PBIT target will be measured on a consistent basis with respect to intercompany 
charges and exceptional items.
  The Committee will also carry out a qualitative assessment of the performance of the Group as a whole when deciding whether to 
release the shares under the PBIT element of the PSP and SMP. This will ensure that there has been no event outside the Wireless division 
which would make a vesting inappropriate.
To provide a further alignment of interest with shareholders, the Executive Directors and others participating in the SMP are required to retain 
in shares an amount equal in value to 50% of the after-tax gain made until they have built up a shareholding equal to 100% of base salary.
The Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Company's Sharesave Plan 2009 and the Share Incentive Plan which are 
available to all employees.
The use of new issue or treasury shares to satisfy awards made under the share plans is subject to a 15% dilution limit in any ten-year 
period. The current potential dilution is below this level. The Committee, aware of shareholders' views in connection with this matter, 
continues to take active steps to control the dilutive effect of the Company's share incentives and is currently working under an informal 
dilution limit of 10%. The actual dilution is currently 7.0%. 34     Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010

Other share plans
Recruitment award to Richard Amos
In addition to the long-term incentive plans detailed above, the Committee awarded Richard Amos a one-off Restricted Share Award on 
his commencement of employment. The Award of 150,000 ordinary shares was granted on 10 December 2009 pursuant to the exemption 
from the need for prior shareholder approval contained in Listing Rule 9.4.2 R(2). The Committee confirms that the Award was felt to be 
necessary to facilitate the recruitment of Mr Amos.
The Award will normally vest on the second anniversary of the date of grant, subject to Mr Amos remaining employed by the Group at that 
time. No consideration was paid by Mr Amos for the Award.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the Award will vest within the three-month period (or such other period as the Board 
may determine) following such event.
Management Incentive Plan
In 2007, the Company introduced a Management Incentive Plan (MIP) for key employees. The MIP is not available to Executive Directors and 
all awards are settled using market purchase shares or a cash equivalent. Further details of the MIP are contained in note 9 on page 58.
Service contracts
The Committee's policy is that all Executive Directors' service contracts will be rolling contracts of one year's duration. Information regarding 
the service contracts of Executive Directors' who served during the year is summarised in the table below.
Executive Director    Date of contract Notice period
Christopher Humphrey  3 February 2003 12 months
Richard Amos  2 November 2009 12 months
 
Executive Directors are not permitted to hold external Non-Executive Directorships or offices without the approval of the Board. No Executive 
Director received any fees in respect of any external Non-Executive Directorships held during the year.
The table below sets out the rights the Company has to pay Executive Directors in lieu of notice together with the contractual compensation 
payable if the Company terminates the contract (other than for cause) without notice.

1 Contractual benefits for Christopher Humphrey alone include the annual performance bonus he would have received had he continued to be employed from the date of   
 termination until the expiry of the notice period. 
2  Payments cease, in effect, if the Executive Director commences employment with a new employer during the payment period.
Other than in the case of dismissal for gross misconduct, the provisions of Christopher Humphrey's service contract will be honoured in full. 
The Company is aware of the provisions in the Combined Code which state that compensation payments should reflect a departing Director's 
obligation to mitigate his loss. However, the Company has adopted the above described approach to determining the compensation that is 
payable in the event that Christopher Humphrey's service contract is terminated as it believes that it is in shareholders' interests that the 
maximum obligations of each party in such circumstances are transparent and agreed in advance to provide certainty.
If the Company terminates Christopher Humphrey's employment without cause, the Committee will be asked to exercise any discretion 
it has under the terms of any share incentive plans in his favour. If the Remuneration Committee determines not to follow this 
recommendation, he shall be entitled to damages.
These terms do not apply to Richard Amos. Indeed, the provisions in Richard Amos's contract are in line with the Committee's standard 
policy for new Executive Director appointments. These are that, in the event of termination without cause, he would be entitled to 12 
months' salary only, paid in monthly instalments and with mitigation. There are no obligations on the Remuneration Committee to exercise 
its discretion in respect of the terms of the share incentive plans.
Non-Executive Directors
Clay Brendish has a three-year term of office with six months' notice of termination required by either party. David Hurst-Brown, Nigel 
Clifford and Paul Taylor each have a three-year term of office with no notice period or provision for compensation for loss of office.
Further details of the Non-Executive Directors' terms of employment can be found on page 27.
The Board reviews the independent Non-Executive Directors' fees annually, in the course of which it compares fees paid to Non-Executive Directors 
of comparable companies. Fees recognise the additional responsibilities undertaken by the Non-Executive Directors in chairing the Board and 
its Committees. In addition to their fees, the Non-Executive Directors are entitled to reimbursement of reasonable business expenses.
 Remuneration report  continued Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010     35
The Chairman's fees are set by the Remuneration Committee. He is not present at any discussion of his own remuneration. There will be no 
increases in Non-Executive Directors' fees for the year commencing 1 May 2010.

awards granted in 2007 and 2008 should not lapse but should be capable of vesting on the agreed vesting date, subject to the extent to 
which the performance conditions are satisfied at that time and a pro rata reduction on the size of the original award up to the date of 
resignation. Due to the Group's results not achieving minimum performance levels for 30 April 2010, his award dated 31 July 2007 will lapse 
on 31 July 2010.
