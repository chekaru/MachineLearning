Remuneration report
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and associated legislation and meets the relevant requirements 
of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. As required by the relevant legislation, a resolution to approve the report will be 
proposed at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company at which the financial statements will be presented for approval. 
The relevant legislation requires the independent auditors to report to the Company's shareholders on certain specified matters and this 
report has, therefore, been split into separate sections for the unaudited and audited information. 
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee is a committee of the Board and comprises the Non-Executive Directors who are independent of 
management and free from any business or other relationship which could interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.  
The Company Chairman (who was independent on appointment) is also a member. 
During the year, membership of the Committee was as follows: David Hurst-Brown (Chairman of the Committee), Clay Brendish, Nigel 
Clifford and Paul Taylor. 
The Committee met four times formally and once informally during the year. Details of attendance at the meetings are shown in the table  
in the Corporate governance report on page 29. 
The principal function of the Committee is to make recommendations to the Board on the remuneration policy for Executive Directors. It is 
also responsible for setting the individual remuneration packages for the Chairman (in his absence), the Executive Directors and the Chief 
Executive's direct reports, and for monitoring and approving the operation of all share-based incentive arrangements. The Committee also 
determines the terms and conditions of employment of the Executive Directors. 
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference which are posted on the Company's website. 
Advice and assistance 
Aon Hewitt Limited (operating through the brand Hewitt New Bridge Street) is the Committee's independent adviser on executive 
remuneration and employee share schemes. Neither Aon Hewitt Limited nor any other part of the Aon Corporation group provided other 
services to the Company during the year. The Group Finance Director provides the Committee with information and assistance and only 
attends meetings by invitation. The Chief Executive regularly attends meetings, by invitation, to provide his insight on business objectives, 
the individual performance of his direct reports and pay and conditions throughout the Group. No Executive Director or senior manager is, 
however, present when their own remuneration is being specifically discussed. 
Remuneration policy 
Main principles 
The Company's objective is to attract, retain and incentivise high-calibre executives who can drive the business forward and increase 
shareholder value. To meet this objective, the Company follows three key principles:
 	 total rewards are designed to be competitive, with the remuneration package of each Executive Director and his direct reports 
benchmarked regularly against the market; 
 	 incentive-based rewards are seen as an important part of each Executive Director's total remuneration and are designed to drive and 
reward exceptional performance; and 
 	 long-term incentive arrangements are designed to align the interests of the Executive Directors and senior managers with those of the 
shareholders and to support the Company's business strategy. 
The Committee also ensures that, when determining the Executive Directors' remuneration packages, due account is taken of pay and 
employment conditions elsewhere in the Group. In this regard, the Committee ensures (via regular interaction with the Company's HR 
function and the Chief Executive's attendance at certain meetings) that it is kept fully abreast of all relevant Group-wide remuneration-
related issues.
The Committee ensures that the incentive structures for Executive Directors and senior managers will not raise environmental, social or 
governance (ESG) risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. More generally, with regard to overall remuneration structures, 
there is no restriction on the Committee which prevents it from taking into account ESG matters. In addition, these remuneration structures 
neither encourage nor reward inappropriate operational risk taking and are applied with due account taken of the Company's risk policies 
and systems. 
Reward structure 
The Executive Directors' total remuneration packages consist of: 
 	 base salary; 
 	 annual performance bonus; 
 	 pension contributions; 
 	 other benefits and allowances; and 
 	 long-term incentive arrangements.  34 Management and governance
Base salary 
Base salary is reviewed annually and is set with reference to salary levels for similar roles in other comparable companies in the software 
and computer services sector and the market generally. The factors for comparability include market sector, size and business complexity.
There were no increases in base salary levels awarded to the Executive Directors last year. From 1 May 2011 Mr Humphrey (who, as 
described below, receives no formal pension provision) has had his car allowance consolidated with his basic pay, making his revised basic 
pay  334,000 per annum. In addition, Mr Humphrey will be granted a nil cost option in July 2011 for shares worth approximately  15,000  
at a share price to be determined at grant. This award becomes exercisable one year following grant. The Committee believed that the grant 
of this award was more appropriate than increasing Mr Humphrey's fixed cash remuneration and, as such, was granted without any 
performance conditions. In the event of a change in control of the Company, the award will vest in full. 
Mr Amos, whose basic pay has remained unchanged since he joined in November 2009 (and who, as described below, receives a significantly 
below-market pension provision) has received a 13.5% increase in pay, on 1 May 2011, to  210,000 per annum in order to bring him more in 
line with market competitive rates. 
The Committee is comfortable that the approach outlined above is very much in the interests of shareholders and reflects the integral role 
played by Messrs Humphrey and Amos in the Company's continued strong performance.
Annual performance bonus 
The Company operates an Annual Bonus Plan (the Plan) for Executive Directors. Under the terms of the Plan for year ended 30 April 2011, a 
bonus of up to 125% of salary could be earned. Bonuses were determined by performance against a sliding scale of challenging Group profit 
growth targets (worth up to a maximum of 100% of salary) and delivery of key strategic business objectives (a maximum of 25% of salary). 
In reviewing the performance of the whole year, the Committee awarded both Mr Humphrey and Mr Amos the maximum award at 125%  
of salary following the successful achievement of the stretching profit targets and their objectives for the year (a period in which the share 
price also grew by almost 90%).
For the financial year 2011/12 the Plan will again be primarily based on the achievement of profit growth targets. Achievement of budgeted 
profitability will entitle the participant to a bonus of 12.5% (2010: 25%) of base salary, with stretching targets above this required to be met 
in order for the maximum 100% of base salary, that is applicable to this element of the bonus, to be paid. In addition, up to a further 25% of 
base salary is payable for the achievement of personal/strategic objectives although, for such payments to be made, a minimum level of 
profit growth must be achieved. 
Pension contributions 
Christopher Humphrey makes his own pension arrangements and the Group makes no payment in this respect. Richard Amos belongs to  
the Anite Stakeholder Pension Plan and the Company contributes 5% of his base salary on the basis that he contributes a minimum of 3%. 
Other benefits and allowances 
Executive Directors are entitled to a car allowance (although, from 1 May 2011, Mr Humphrey's car allowance was consolidated into his  
base salary), fuel, medical insurance, death-in-service and permanent health insurance, together with reasonable business expenses.
Long-term incentive arrangements 
The Company operates the following two long-term share-based incentive plans for Executive Directors: 
 	 the Performance Share Plan (PSP); and 
 	 the Share Matching Plan (SMP). 
Under the PSP an individual may receive an award of shares worth up to 100% of their salary per annum (although in exceptional 
circumstances an award of up to 200% of their salary may be made). 
The Executive Directors are also able to participate in the SMP. As originally structured, participants were allowed to lodge in the SMP shares 
worth up to 30% per annum of base salary, which were then matched on a two-for-one (grossed up for tax) basis. In 2007, the Company 
sought shareholder approval to provide participants with the opportunity to invest a higher amount (up to 90% of base salary) than the 
normal 30% limit, over the period from 1 May 2007 to 30 April 2010.
At the 2010 AGM, shareholders approved a proposal to amend the SMP so that executives were again given the opportunity to invest up to 90% 
of base salary over the period from 1 May 2010 to 30 April 2013, and then going forward over successive rolling three financial year periods. 
Pursuant to this change, while the effective average annual level of co-investment in the SMP remains unchanged at 30% per annum, 
executives have the opportunity to invest a higher amount in any of the three financial years provided the aggregate investment over that 
period does not exceed 90% of salary. In 2010, Mr Humphrey invested 90% of salary and Mr Amos 60%. The original two-for-one gross 
matching ratio was retained. 
Awards granted under the PSP and SMP are subject to three-year performance conditions. 
Remuneration report continued Management and governance 35
PSP awards 2008 and 2009 performance conditions
 	 Half of each award is subject to a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) target. This is measured relative to the FTSE All-Share Software and 
Computer Services Sector, with 25% of this portion of awards vesting at the median and full vesting at the upper quartile. Straight-line 
vesting applies between these points. 
 	 Half of each award is assessed by reference to Anite's Earnings Per Share (EPS) performance. For compound annual EPS growth of at least 
RPI plus 4% per annum, 25% of awards subject to this part of the condition will vest and, for full vesting, compound annual EPS growth 
must be at least RPI plus 12% per annum. Straight-line vesting applies between these points. 
The EPS figure for the measurement for PSP awards made in 2008 was 5.1p being the basic earnings per share of the Company before the 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets, gains and losses from the disposal of operations, impairment charges and including capitalisation 
of research and development costs, with such adjustments as may be made by the Committee. This element of the award will lapse, as the 
performance conditions were not met at the end of the performance period at 30 April 2011.
The EPS figure for the measurement for PSP awards made in 2009 was 4.4p being the adjusted earnings per share from continuing 
operations before disposed businesses, other gains and losses, share-based payments, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and 
restructuring costs. 
In addition to the TSR targets, before any awards vest, the Committee must also have satisfied itself that the Company's underlying financial 
performance over the performance period warrants the level of vesting determined by reference to the TSR performance condition and EPS 
performance condition. The extent to which the performance condition is satisfied will be calculated by external consultants to ensure the 
appropriate level of third-party verification. 
PSP awards 2010 performance conditions
 	 Half of the award is based on the Company's relative TSR compared with the FTSE All-Share Software and Computer Services Sector,  
as was the case with past awards. 
 	 Half of the award is based on the adjusted Profit before Interest and Tax (PBIT) performance of the Wireless division and split into two parts:
 1.  75% (i.e. 37 .5% of the total grant) will be based on the sum of the PBIT of the Wireless division in each of the three financial years  
of the performance period. The following vesting schedule will apply to this part of the award: 
Total PBIT of Wireless division for 2011, 2012 and 2013 Proportion of the 75% of the PBIT target which vests 
Less than  42.5m 0% 
 42.5m 25% (i.e. 18.75% of the PBIT awards)
Between  42.5m and  50m Pro rata from 25% to 100% (i.e. 18.75% to 75%  
 of the PBIT awards) 
 50m or above 100% (i.e. 75% of the PBIT awards)
 2.  25% (i.e. 12.5% of the total grant) will be paid if in any one year of the performance period the PBIT of the Wireless division is  
in excess of  23.4m (which was the sum of the record years of PBIT the Handset and Network Testing businesses achieved in 2007  
and 2009 respectively). 
  Note that measures 1 and 2 above will be assessed independently of each other. In addition, these are both independent of the TSR 
target which will continue to apply to half of all awards.
PSP and SMP 2011 awards performance conditions 
 	 Half of the award will continue to be based on the Company's relative TSR compared with the FTSE All-Share Software and Computer 
Services Sector, as was the case with past awards.
 	 Half of the award will be based on the adjusted PBIT performance of the Wireless division and split into two parts: 
 1.  75% (i.e. 37 .5% of the total grant) will be based on the sum of the PBIT of the Wireless division in each of the three financial years  
of the performance period. The following vesting schedule will apply to this part of the award: 
Total PBIT of Wireless division for 2012, 2013 and 2014 Proportion of the 75% of the PBIT target which vests
Less than  54m 0% 
 54m 25% (i.e. 18.75% of the PBIT awards)
Between  54m and  64m Pro rata from 25% to 100% (i.e. 18.75% to 75%  
 of the PBIT awards) 
 64m or above 100% (i.e. 75% of the PBIT awards)
 2.  25% (i.e. 12.5% of the total grant) will be paid if in any one year of the performance period the PBIT of the Wireless division is in 
excess of  23.4m (which was the sum of the record years of PBIT the Handset and Network Testing businesses achieved in 2007  
and 2009 respectively). 36 Management and governance
  In the event that acquisitions or disposals are made during the three-year period, the Committee may, with appropriate financial advice, 
make adjustments to the PBIT target. Furthermore, the PBIT target will be measured on a consistent basis with respect to intercompany 
charges and exceptional items. 
  In addition, the Committee will also carry out a qualitative assessment of the performance of the Group as a whole when deciding 
whether to release the shares under the PBIT element of the PSP and SMP. This will ensure that there has been no event outside the 
Wireless division which would make a vesting inappropriate. Finally, in the event of a change in control of the Company, the Committee 
can decide to determine vesting of the entire awards by reference to the TSR performance conditions (if, for example, it proves 
impractical to measure performance against PBIT targets at the relevant time).
  The Committee will keep the structure and operation of the Company's share incentive arrangements under regular review to ensure 
they take due account of market/best practice and the Company's strategic objectives.
To provide a further alignment of interest with shareholders, the Executive Directors participating in the PSP and SMP, when exercising an 
award, are required to retain in shares an amount equal in value to 50% of the after-tax gain made until they have built up a shareholding 
equal to 100% of base salary. 
The Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Company's Sharesave Plan and the Share Incentive Plan which are available to 
all UK employees. 
The use of new issue or treasury shares to satisfy awards made under the share plans is subject to a 15% dilution limit in any ten-year 
period. The current potential dilution is below this level. The Committee, aware of shareholders' views in connection with this matter, 
continues to take active steps to control the dilutive effect of the Company's share incentives and is currently working under an informal 
dilution limit of 10%. The actual potential dilution is currently 7.7% (2010: 7.0%).
Other share plans 
Recruitment award to Richard Amos 
In addition to the long-term incentive plans detailed above, the Committee awarded Richard Amos a one-off Restricted Share Award  
on the commencement of his employment. The award of 150,000 ordinary shares was granted on 10 December 2009 pursuant to the 
exemption from the need for prior shareholder approval contained in Listing Rule 9.4.2 R(2). No consideration was paid by Mr Amos for  
the award. The Committee confirms that the award was felt to be necessary to facilitate the recruitment of Mr Amos. 
The award will normally vest on 10 December 2011, the second anniversary of the date of grant, subject to Mr Amos remaining employed  
by the Group at that time. In the event of a change of control of the Company, the award will vest within the three-month period (or such 
other period as the Board may determine) following such event. 
Management Incentive Plan 
In 2007, the Company introduced a Management Incentive Plan (MIP) for key employees. The MIP is not available to Executive Directors and 
all awards are settled using market purchase shares or a cash equivalent. Further details of the MIP are contained in note 9 on page 62. 
Conversion of existing awards to nil cost options
On 1 June 2011 the Remuneration Committee approved the conversion of existing outstanding awards (structured as conditional awards) 
under the Performance Share Plan and Management Incentive Plan to nil cost options with a ten-year exercise period. It was felt that this 
would give the participants more flexibility as to when they could obtain their shares under the plans. There was no change to the 
performance conditions or other terms under which the awards were first granted. All awards (including SMP) issued since 1 January 2010 
have been issued as nil cost options with performance conditions attached as explained above.
Service contracts 
The Committee's policy is that all Executive Directors' service contracts will be rolling contracts of one year's duration. Information 
regarding the service contracts of Executive Directors who served during the year is summarised in the table below. 
Executive Director Date of contract Notice period
Christopher Humphrey 3 February 2003 12 months
Richard Amos 2 November 2009 12 months
Executive Directors are not permitted to hold external Non-Executive Directorships or offices without the approval of the Board.  
No Executive Director received any fees in respect of any external Non-Executive Directorships held during the year.

1  Contractual benefits for Christopher Humphrey alone include the annual performance bonus he would have received had he continued to be employed from the date  
of termination until the expiry of the notice period. 
2 Payments cease, in effect, if the Executive Director commences employment with a new employer during the payment period. 
Other than in the case of dismissal for gross misconduct, the provisions of Christopher Humphrey's service contract will be honoured in full. 
The Company is aware of the provisions in the Combined Code which state that compensation payments should reflect a departing Director's 
obligation to mitigate his loss. The Company has, however, adopted the above described approach to determining the compensation that is 
payable in the event that Christopher Humphrey's service contract is terminated as it believes that it is in shareholders' interests that the 
maximum obligations of each party in such circumstances are transparent and agreed in advance to provide certainty.
If the Company terminates Christopher Humphrey's employment without cause, the Committee will be asked to exercise any discretion  
it has under the terms of any share incentive plans in his favour. If the Remuneration Committee determines not to follow this 
recommendation, he shall be entitled to damages.
These terms do not apply to Richard Amos; the provisions in his contract are in line with the Committee's standard ongoing policy for new 
Executive Director appointments. These are that, in the event of termination without cause, he would be entitled to 12 months' salary only, 
paid in monthly instalments and with mitigation. There are no obligations on the Remuneration Committee to exercise its discretion in 
respect of the terms of the share incentive plans.
Non-Executive Directors 
Clay Brendish has a three-year term of office with six months' notice of termination required by either party. David Hurst-Brown, Nigel 
Clifford and Paul Taylor each have a three-year term of office with no notice period or provision for compensation for loss of office. 
Further details of the Non-Executive Directors' terms of employment can be found on page 29.
The Board reviews the independent Non-Executive Directors' fees annually, in the course of which it compares fees paid to Non-Executive 
Directors of comparable companies. Fees recognise the additional responsibilities undertaken by the Non-Executive Directors in chairing the 
Board and its Committees. In addition to their fees, the Non-Executive Directors are entitled to reimbursement of reasonable business expenses.
The Chairman's fees are set by the Remuneration Committee. He is not present at any discussion of his own remuneration. The fees for 
Non-Executive Directors have not been increased since 1 May 2007 or from the date they subsequently joined the Company. Increases  
in Non-Executive Directors' fees for the year commencing 1 May 2011 have been agreed as follows: Clay Brendish - increased by 3%  
to  139,000; David Hurst-Brown - 12% to  47,000 (also Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee);  
Nigel Clifford - 8% to  40,000; and Paul Taylor - 7% to  45,000 (also Chairman of the Audit Committee).

disregarding whether such shares were sold or retained on exercise, and is stated before tax. The 86,956 options exercised were all retained.
The closing price of an ordinary share of Anite plc as at 30 April 2011 was 64.25p. The range of closing prices during the year ended 30 April

Executive Directors' Performance Share Plan, Share Matching Plan and Restricted Share Award
For the reasons explained above, on the 1 June 2011 the Remuneration Committee resolved that all existing Conditional Awards under the 
Management Incentive Plan, Performance Share Plan and Share Matching Plan be converted to nil cost options, subject to the rules of the 
respective plans. The 2010 PSP and SMP awards were both issued as nil cost options.
During the year, the 2007 awards granted under the Performance Share Plan and Share Matching Plan lapsed due to the performance 
conditions not being met.

Former Director 
Steve Rowley resigned as a Director with effect from 31 December 2008 and it was agreed that (i) his Performance Share Plan and Share 
Matching Plan awards granted in 2006 should lapse on 31 December 2008 and (ii) his Performance Share Plan and Share Matching Plan 
awards granted in 2007 and 2008 should not lapse but should be capable of vesting on the agreed vesting date, subject to the extent to 
which the performance conditions are satisfied at that time and a pro rata reduction on the size of the original award up to the date of 
resignation. The 2007 awards lapsed in 2010 due to the Group's results not achieving minimum performance levels for 30 April 2010.
