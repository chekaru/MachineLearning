 ANITE ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012
46
MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and associated legislation, the principles of the 2010 Corporate Governance Code, and meets 
the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. As required by the relevant legislation, a resolution to approve the report will be 
proposed at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company at which the financial statements will be presented for approval. 
At the AGM in 2011, the resolution on adoption of the Remuneration report was passed, albeit with a sizeable minority of around 20% either voting against or abstaining. 
In recognition of this, the Committee has this year consulted more closely with seven of the largest shareholders (who account for approximately 40% of the share 
capital) during the process of determining policy for the forthcoming financial year and drafting this report. The proposals presented herein reflect the outcome of those 
discussions. In arriving at these proposals, the Committee has also taken note of the specific issues that it understands were the subject of last year's shareholder 
concerns. In particular, it has restructured the CEO's salary package to remove the grant of options in lieu of basic salary increases and has restructured the performance 
conditions associated with this year's grant of PSP incentives to remove the condition that was seen as rolling retesting by some shareholders.
The relevant legislation requires the independent auditors to report to the Company's shareholders on certain specified matters and this report has, therefore, been split 
into separate sections for the unaudited and audited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION  
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
The Remuneration Committee is a committee of the Board and comprises the Non-Executive Directors who are independent of management and free from any  
business or other relationship that could interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. The Company Chairman (who was independent on appointment)  
is also a member. 
During the year, membership of the Committee was as follows: David Hurst-Brown (Chairman of the Committee), Clay Brendish, Nigel Clifford and Paul Taylor. 
The Committee met five times during the year. Details of attendance at the meetings are shown in the table in the Corporate governance report on page 42. 
The principal function of the Committee is to make recommendations to the Board on the remuneration policy for Executive Directors. It is also responsible for setting 
the individual remuneration packages for the Chairman (in his absence), for certain other members of the executive management, and for monitoring and approving  
the operation of all share-based incentive arrangements. The Committee also determines the terms and conditions of employment of the Executive Directors. 
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference which are posted on the Company's website. 
ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE 
New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Hewitt Limited, part of Aon plc) is the Committee's independent adviser on executive remuneration and employee share 
schemes. Neither New Bridge Street nor any other part of Aon plc provided other services to the Company during the year. The Group Finance Director provides the 
Committee with information and assistance and only attends meetings by invitation. The Chief Executive regularly attends meetings, by invitation, to provide his  
insight on business objectives, the individual performance of his direct reports and pay and conditions throughout the Group. No individual is present when their  
own remuneration is being specifically discussed. 
REMUNERATION POLICY 
MAIN PRINCIPLES 
The Company's objective is to attract, retain and incentivise high-calibre executives who can drive the business forward and increase shareholder value. To meet this 
objective, the Company follows three key principles: 
   total rewards are designed to be competitive, with the remuneration package of each Executive Director and his direct reports benchmarked regularly against 
companies of a similar size and in similar markets; 
   incentive-based rewards are seen as an important part of each Executive Director's total remuneration and are designed to drive and reward exceptional performance; 
and
   long-term incentive arrangements are designed to align the interests of the Executive Directors and senior managers with those of the shareholders and to support 
the Company's business strategy. 
The Committee also ensures that, when determining the Executive Directors' remuneration packages, due account is taken of pay and employment conditions elsewhere 
in the Group. In this regard, the Committee ensures, via the Chief Executive's and Group Finance Director's attendance at certain meetings, that it is kept fully abreast  
of all relevant Group-wide remuneration-related issues. 
The Chairman of the Committee also meets with a number of major investors to discuss proposed remuneration and incentive plans for the Executives, giving them the 
opportunity to raise any related issues of concern before they are implemented.
REMUNERATION REPORT  47
MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE
The Committee ensures that remuneration structures neither encourage nor reward inappropriate operational risk-taking and are applied with due account taken of  
the Company's risk policies and systems. In addition, the Committee ensures that the incentive structures for Executive Directors and senior managers will not raise 
environmental, social or governance (ESG) risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. More generally, with regard to overall remuneration structures,  
there is no restriction on the Committee that prevents it from taking into account ESG matters. 
REWARD STRUCTURE 
The Executive Directors' total remuneration packages consist of: 
   base salary; 
   annual performance bonus; 
   pension contributions (Group Finance Director only); 
   other benefits and allowances; and 
   share-based long-term incentive arrangements.
BASE SALARY 
Base salary is reviewed annually and is set with reference to salary levels for similar roles in other comparable companies in the software and computer services sector 
and the market generally. It also takes into account the personal performance and contribution to corporate performance by the individual. The factors for comparability 
include market sector, size and business complexity.
For the 2012 review, the Remuneration Committee paid particular regard to the appropriate positioning of the Executive Directors' salaries, taking into account the 
significant growth in Anite's business and share price over the last few years, and hence its relative comparative position within the market. When Christopher Humphrey 
was first appointed to the role of CEO in December 2008, the Company had a market value of around  85 million. At the time of his appointment to Chief Executive, 
together with Richard Amos' appointment as Group Finance Director in 2009, their salaries were set at conservative levels to reflect, in part, this relative market positioning.
Since December 2008, the Company's market capitalisation has more than quadrupled, to approximately  350 million at the time of writing. This represents a total 
shareholder return over the period of over 300%, compared to around 50% across the FTSE All Share over the same time. The Company has recently been promoted  
to the FTSE 250 index. The Company's revenue and adjusted profit before tax (PBT ) have also increased by 36% and 55% respectively over the same period, 
demonstrating the increased size of the Group.
In the view of the Committee this excellent performance represents a step-change in the size of the Group and the responsibilities involved in running the Group. 
Therefore, following consultation with the leading shareholders of the Company, the Committee concluded that the salary reviews for Mr Humphrey and Mr Amos  
for 2012 should reflect this fundamental shift in market position. 
In addition, other factors that the Committee took into account when considering salary increases for the Executive Directors for 2012 were:
   the exceptional performance of the individuals concerned, their importance to the Group and their contribution to restoring shareholder value and financial stability 
to the Group over the last few years; 
   when Mr Humphrey and Mr Amos were appointed into their roles, both their salaries were deliberately set at a significant discount to their predecessors to reflect the 
fact that they were new to their roles and to provide scope for future salary rises as they matured into these; and
   in Mr Humphrey's case, the fact that he has not had a salary increase for the period since his appointment in 2008, other than the consolidation of car allowance and 
the one-off  grant of nil cost options worth approximately  15,000 in 2011.
Taking these factors into account, the Remuneration Committee has awarded underlying  base salary increases to both Mr Humphrey and Mr Amos of 12.2%. 
Furthermore, in common with other senior executives in the Group, Mr Amos' car allowance of  14,400 has been consolidated into his base salary from the same date.  
This results in the following salaries from 1 May 2012:
   Christopher Humphrey   375,000
   Richard Amos  250,000
This compared to average salary increases at 1 May 2012 for all staff in the Group of around 3.5%. Over the last three years, the cumulative salary increases across the 
Group have been around 10%. 
The Committee is comfortable that the approach outlined above is very much in the interests of shareholders and reflects the integral role played by Messrs Humphrey 
and Amos in the Company's continued strong performance.  ANITE ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012

MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE
PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS 
Mr Humphrey makes his own pension arrangements and the Group makes no payment in this respect. Mr Amos belongs to the Anite Stakeholder Pension Plan and from 
1 May 2012 the Company will contribute 10% (previously 5%) of his base salary on the basis that he contributes a minimum of 5%.
OTHER BENEFITS AND ALLOWANCES 
Following the recent salary reviews there are no longer any car allowances. Executive Directors are entitled to medical insurance, death-in-service, permanent health 
insurance and car fuel expenses together with reasonable business expenses. 
ANNUAL PERFORMANCE BONUS 
The Company operates an Annual Bonus Plan (the Plan) for Executive Directors, which rewards the achievement of meeting stretching annual profit growth targets and 
also individual personal objectives aligned to the Group's strategy.
2012 BONUS
Under the terms of the Plan, for year ended 30 April 2012, a bonus of up to 125% of salary could be earned - 100% for profit achievement and 25% for achieving personal 
objectives that were agreed at the beginning of the new financial year. 
The profit bonus for 2012 was determined on a sliding scale for achieving growth in adjusted PBT, where at budget level 12.5% of salary would be earned. In order to earn 
the maximum 100% of salary, PBT had to exceed by 50% that achieved in 2011.
The actual performance for the year ended 30 April 2012 resulted in PBT exceeding the prior year's result by 75%. This was in excess of the maximum target set by the 
Committee and therefore as a result of the excellent performance for the year, the Committee awarded both Mr Humphrey and Mr Amos the maximum award at 100% 
of salary for successfully exceeding the stretching profit targets.
The Committee reviewed performance against the personal objectives set for Mr Humphrey and Mr Amos for 2011/12, which included strategic, customer-facing and 
investor-based objectives. They considered that these had been achieved and therefore awarded them both the maximum of 25% of salary. 
2013 BONUS
For the financial year ending 30 April 2013 the Plan will again be primarily based on the achievement of stretching profit growth targets. At budget profit level, which 
reflects significant growth over the past year's achievement, 25% of salary will be paid, with the maximum profit bonus only being awarded if the budgeted performance 
is exceeded by 20%, at which level a maximum of 100% of salary would be paid. In addition, up to 25% will be based on the achievement of agreed personal objectives. 
While the exact targets cannot be disclosed for reasons of commercial sensitivity, they are tied to the strategic objectives and key performance indicators of the Group. 
The Committee believes these targets are appropriately stretching and if delivered will represent value creation for shareholders.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE ARRANGEMENTS 
The Company operates the following two long-term share-based incentive plans for Executive Directors, which are designed to align with shareholders' interests by 
encouraging investment in Anite shares: 
   the Performance Share Plan (PSP); and 
   the Share Matching Plan (SMP). 
Under the PSP the policy for Executive Directors is that an annual award of shares is made of 100% of salary per annum, which is the normal maximum limit under the 
Plan (although in exceptional circumstances an award of up to 200% of their salary may be made). 
The Executive Directors are also able to participate in the SMP. Under the SMP, since 1 May 2010, executives may invest up to 90% of base salary in any rolling three-year 
period (i.e. an average annual level of co-investment of 30% per annum, with the opportunity to invest a higher amount in any of the three financial years). In 2010,  
Mr Humphrey invested 90% of salary and Mr Amos 60%. In 2011, Mr Amos invested a further 30%, taking his investment up to the maximum of 90% of salary. 
Therefore, as both Mr Humphrey and Mr Amos have reached their three-year investment limit, no SMP investments may be made by them in 2012. 
Investment shares are matched at a ratio of two-for-one (grossed up for tax). The shares lodged against the SMP scheme have to be held by the Directors throughout  
the performance period. 
Awards granted under the PSP and SMP are subject to three-year performance conditions. The performance conditions for the awards made in 2011 and forthcoming 
2012 awards are set out below. The conditions applying to awards made prior to 2011 are set out as footnotes to the table of PSP and SMP interests. 
Currently, the policy is that half of awards made under the PSP and SMP are based on the Group's relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR ) performance and half are on the 
financial performance of the Wireless Division over the three-year vesting period. The Remuneration Committee continues to believe that this provides a suitable blend of targets, 
ensuring a focus on both the delivery of above market returns to shareholders and delivery of the core financial performance applicable to the Group's strategy and plans.
REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED  49
MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE
PSP AND SMP 2011 AWARDS PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS 
   Half of awards are based on the Company's relative TSR compared with the FTSE All-Share Software and Computer Services Sector. The following vesting schedule  
will apply:
TSR ranking Proportion of shares vesting 
Below median        0%
Median 25%
Between median and upper quartile On a straight-line basis between 25% and 100%
Upper quartile or above        100%
   Half of the award will be based on the adjusted PBIT performance of the Wireless division and split into two parts: 
1. 75% (i.e. 37 .5% of the total grant) will be based on the sum of the PBIT of the Wireless division in each of the three financial years of the performance period. 
The following vesting schedule will apply to this part of the award:
Total PBIT of Wireless division for 2012, 2013 and 2014  Proportion of shares vesting 
Less than  54m        0%
 54m 25%
Between  54m and  64m Pro rata from 25% to 100% 
 64m or above        100%
2. 25% (i.e. 12.5% of award) will be paid if in any one year of the performance period the PBIT of the Wireless division is in excess of  23.4m (which was the sum  
of the record years of PBIT the Handset and Network Testing businesses that now make up the Wireless division achieved in 2007 and 2009 respectively).
PERFORMANCE TO DATE
If 30 April 2012 were the end of the performance period, the Company's TSR over the performance period to date would have placed it within the top quartile 
of the comparator group, which would result in full vesting of that element of the awards.
Total PBIT of Wireless division for 2012, 2013 and 2014  Proportion of upper end of target range achieved so far 
PBIT for 2012 -  26.8m (upper end of target range over the full three years:  64m)  42% 
In respect of measure 2 above, the 2012 PBIT result for the Wireless division totalled  26.8m, exceeding the performance target required of  23.4m. This element  
will therefore vest at the end of the performance period. 
PSP 2012 AWARDS PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS 
   Half of the award will be based on the Company's relative TSR compared with the FTSE techMARK index which has replaced the previously used FTSE Software and 
Computer Services sector. The decision to use a new comparative index was taken due to the dwindling number of constituents in the previously used index. By way  
of example the number of companies in the FTSE Software and Computer Services index has declined from 23 a year ago to an estimated 15 companies at present, 
assuming that recently announced agreed takeovers are completed. The view taken by the Committee was, that such a small sample of comparators could produce 
distorted outcomes. By way of comparison FTSE techMARK comprises 63 companies including most of those in the FTSE Computer Software and Services sector. ANITE ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012

Median 25%

Upper quartile or above        100%
   Half of the award will be based on the sum of the PBIT of the Wireless division in each of the three financial years of the performance period. The following vesting 
schedule will apply to this part of the award: 
Total PBIT of Wireless division for 2013, 2014 and 2015  Proportion of shares vesting 
Less than  105m        0%
 105m 25%
Between  105-120m Pro rata from 25% to 100% 
 120m or above        100%
In addition, the Committee will also carry out a qualitative assessment of the performance of the Group as a whole when deciding whether to release the shares under  
the PBIT element of the PSP and SMP. This will ensure that there has been no event outside the Wireless division that would make a vesting inappropriate. 
In the event that acquisitions or disposals are made during the three-year period, the Committee may, with appropriate financial advice, make adjustments to the 
PBIT target. Furthermore, the PBIT target will be measured on a consistent basis with respect to intercompany charges and exceptional items. 
Finally, in the event of a change in control of the Company, the Committee can decide to determine vesting of the entire awards by reference to the TSR performance 
conditions (if, for example, it proves impractical to measure performance against PBIT targets at the relevant time).
The Committee will keep the structure and operation of the Company's share incentive arrangements under regular review to ensure they take due account of market/
best practice and the Company's strategic and risk management objectives and do not encourage excessive operational risk taking. 
SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES
To provide a further alignment of interest with shareholders, the Executive Directors participating in the PSP and SMP, when exercising an award, are required to retain  
in shares an amount equal in value to 50% of the after-tax gain made until they have built up a shareholding equal to 100% of base salary. Both Executive Directors  
held in excess of 100% of salary in shares at the date of this report.
The use of new issue or treasury shares to satisfy awards made under the share plans is subject to a 15% dilution limit in any ten-year period. The current potential 
dilution is below this level. The Committee, aware of shareholders' views in connection with this matter, continues to take active steps to control the dilutive effect  
of the Company's share incentives and is currently working under an informal dilution limit of 10%. The actual potential dilution is currently 7.7% (2011: 7.7%). 
OTHER SHARE PLANS 
RECRUITMENT AWARD TO RICHARD AMOS 
In addition to the long-term incentive plans detailed above, the Committee awarded Mr Amos a one-off Restricted Share Award on the commencement of his 
employment. The award of 150,000 ordinary shares was granted on 10 December 2009. No consideration was paid by Mr Amos for the award. The Committee  
confirms that the award was felt to be necessary to facilitate the recruitment of Mr Amos. 
The award vested on 10 December 2011, and the value of the award based on the mid-market value on the date of exercise was  130,035. After selling 78,276 shares  
to pay for tax, national insurance and dealing costs Mr Amos retained 71,724 shares, which were added to his shareholding in the Company. 
EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION
As disclosed last year, Mr Humphrey was awarded a nil cost option for 20,134 shares on 30 June 2011 as part of last year's remuneration package review. This award  
vests after one year and must be exercised within five years of the grant date. The Committee believed that the grant of this award was more appropriate than 
increasing Mr Humphrey's fixed cash remuneration and, as such, it was granted without any performance conditions. 51
MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE
SHARESAVE AND SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN
The Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Company's Sharesave Plan and the Share Incentive Plan, which are available to all UK employees. 
MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN 
In 2007, the Company introduced a Management Incentive Plan (MIP) for key employees. The MIP is not available to Executive Directors and all awards are settled  
using market purchase shares or cash equivalent. Further details of the MIP are contained in note 10 on page 79. 
CONVERSION OF EXISTING AWARDS TO NIL COST OPTIONS 
On 1 June 2011, the Remuneration Committee approved the conversion of existing outstanding awards (structured as conditional awards) under the Performance Share 
Plan and Management Incentive Plan to nil cost options with a ten-year exercise period. It was felt that this would give the participants more flexibility as to when they 
could obtain their shares under the plans. There was no change to the performance conditions or other terms under which the awards were first granted. All awards issued 
since 1 January 2010 have been issued as nil cost options with performance conditions attached as explained above. 
SERVICE CONTRACTS 
The Committee's policy is that all Executive Directors' service contracts will be rolling contracts of one year's duration. Information regarding the service contracts  
of Executive Directors who served during the year is summarised in the table below. 
Executive Director      Date of contract  Notice period 
Christopher Humphrey 3 February 2003 12 months
Richard Amos      2 November 2009 12 months
Executive Directors are not permitted to hold external Non-Executive Directorships or offices without the approval of the Board. During the year the Board gave approval 
on 14 November 2011 for Mr Humphrey to hold the position of Non-Executive Director at Alterian plc. Due to the subsequent takeover of that company Mr Humphrey 
resigned from the position on 31 January 2012. Mr Humphrey retained gross fees of  25,077 for services during his period of tenure. 
The table below sets out the rights the Company has to pay Executive Directors in lieu of notice together with the contractual compensation payable if the Company 
terminates the contract (other than for cause) without notice.

1 Contractual benefits for Christopher Humphrey alone include the annual performance bonus he would have received had he continued to be employed from the date of termination  
until the expiry of the notice period. 
2 Payments cease, in effect, if the Executive Director commences employment with a new employer during the payment period. 
Other than in the case of dismissal for gross misconduct, the provisions of Mr Humphrey's service contract will be honoured in full. These legacy contractual provisions 
were agreed many years ago when standard practice for service contracts was different to current prevailing corporate governance standards. 
The Company adopted the above described approach to determining the compensation that is payable in the event that Mr Humphrey's service contract is terminated as 
it believed at the time of agreeing his contract that it was in shareholders' interests that the maximum obligations of each party in such circumstances were transparent 
and agreed in advance to provide certainty. 
If the Company terminates Mr Humphrey's employment without cause, the Committee will be asked to exercise any discretion it has under the terms of any share 
incentive plans in his favour. If the Remuneration Committee determines not to follow this recommendation, he shall be entitled to damages. ANITE ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012
52
MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE
The Company is aware of the provisions now in place for the UK Corporate Governance Code which states that compensation payments should reflect a departing 
Director's obligation to mitigate his loss. However, the Committee considers that the cost of amending Mr Humphrey's contract in respect of the above (including the 
cost of any compensation he might be entitled to claim) could outweigh the existing termination costs under his contract and therefore such a change is not the most 
economical solution for shareholders. 
These terms do not apply to Mr Amos; the provisions in his contract reflect the Committee's standard ongoing policy for new Executive Director appointments, which are 
fully compliant with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. These are that, in the event of termination without cause, he would be entitled to 12 months' 
salary only, paid in monthly instalments and with mitigation. There are no obligations on the Remuneration Committee to exercise its discretion in respect of the terms  
of the share incentive plans. 
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
Mr Brendish has a three-year term of office with six months' notice of termination required by either party. Mr Hurst-Brown, Mr Clifford and Mr Taylor each have  
a three-year term of office with no notice period or provision for compensation for loss of office. 
Further details of the Non-Executive Directors' terms of employment can be found on page 43. 
The Board reviews the independent Non-Executive Directors' fees annually, in the course of which it compares fees paid to Non-Executive Directors of comparable 
companies. Fees recognise the additional responsibilities undertaken by the Non-Executive Directors in chairing the Board and its Committees. In addition to their  
fees, the Non-Executive Directors are entitled to reimbursement of reasonable business expenses. 
The Chairman's fees are set by the Remuneration Committee. He is not present at any discussion of his own remuneration. The fees for Non-Executives, as reported  
in the 2011 Remuneration Report, were increased on 1 May 2011. There was no increase in Non-Executive Directors fees on 1 May 2012.

1. These conditional shares were not converted to nil cost options at 1 June 2011.
2. This award made in 2011 was for nil cost options to the value of  15,000.
3. PSP awards 2008 and 2009 performance conditions.
 a)Half of each award is subject to a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) target. This is measured relative to the FTSE All-Share Software and Computer Services Sector, with 25% of this portion  
of awards vesting at the median and full vesting at the upper quartile. Straight-line vesting applies between these points. 
 b)Half of each award is assessed by reference to Anite's Earnings Per Share (EPS) performance. The Company's EPS growth must match or exceed the UK Government's Retail Price Index (RPI) 
plus 4% compound per annum over the performance period, at which point 25% vests, rising to full vesting for growth of RPI + 12% p.a. or more. 
The vesting position of the awards made in 2008 and 2009 is as follows:
% of award vesting
Grant date Performance period EPS element TSR element Total
August 2008 1 May 2008 to 30 April 2011 0 33.35 33.35
December 2008 1 May 2008 to 30 April 2011 0 26.55 26.55
July 2009* 1 May 2009 to 30 April 2012 50 50 100
* The July 2009 award will vest on 10 July 2012 assuming the other conditions of the scheme continue to be met.
4. PSP and SMP awards 2010 performance conditions 
 a)Half of the award is based on the Company's relative TSR compared with the FTSE All-Share Software and Computer Services Sector, with 25% of this portion of awards vesting at the median 
and full vesting at the upper quartile. Straight-line vesting applies between these points.
 b)Half of the award is based on the adjusted Profit before Interest and Tax (PBIT) performance of the Wireless division and split into two parts: 
i. 75% (i.e. 37 .5% of the total grant) will be based on the sum of the PBIT of the Wireless division in each of the three financial years of the performance period. The following vesting schedule 
will apply to this part of the award: 
REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED  55
MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE
Total PBIT of Wireless division for 2011, 2012 and 2013  Proportion of shares vesting 
Less than  42.5m 0%
 42.5m 25%
Between  42.5m and  50m Pro rata from 25% to 100% 
 50m or above 100%
ii. 25% (i.e. 12.5% of award) will be paid if in any one year of the performance period the PBIT of the Wireless division is in excess of  23.4m (which was the sum of the record years of  
PBIT the Handset and Network Testing businesses achieved in 2007 and 2009 respectively). 
Note that the two profit performance measures above will be assessed independently of each other. In addition, these are both independent of the TSR target, which will continue to apply  
to half of all awards. Performance to date under the 2010 awards indicates that TSR performance to 30 April 2012 would have placed the Company in the top quartile if that were the end  
of the period. 
Performance to date under the element related to the aggregate PBIT of the Wireless division is shown below: 
Total PBIT of Wireless division for 2011, 2012 and 2013 Proportion of target achieved to date 
Profit for 2011 & 2012 -  43.2m (target  50m) 86%
In respect of the second performance measure above, the 2012 results for the Wireless division totalled  26.8m, exceeding the performance target required of  23.4m. This element will therefore 
vest at the end of the performance period (subject to the service condition being met).
FORMER DIRECTOR 
When Steve Rowley resigned as a Director with effect from 31 December 2008 it was agreed that his Performance Share Plan awards granted in 2008 should not lapse 
but should be capable of vesting on the agreed vesting date, subject to the extent to which the performance conditions are satisfied at that time and a pro rata reduction 
on the size of the original award up to the date of resignation. Following the announcement of the 2011 results the TSR element of this award partially vested and 43,339 
options were released to Mr Rowley with remaining options lapsing. The value of the options vesting at the date of exercise was  25,911, being the gross proceeds (before 
tax and national insurance deductions) from the sale of the shares in the market.
