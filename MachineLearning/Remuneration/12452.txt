Remuneration Committee report
The attached report sets out the policies adopted and 
implemented by the Remuneration Committee over 
the last 12 months and those we intend applying going 
forward. We have set it out in a new format that more 
closely matches the proposed BIS regulations that we 
will be required to follow from next year.
The vote that we held at last year's AGM on remuneration was passed  
by a comfortable majority. However we recognise that a minority of 
shareholders who voted did not support last year's report. Broadly their 
concerns fell into three categories. The principal issue was the scale of 
salary increases awarded last year to the Executive Directors. In addition 
some shareholders have concerns that we use both a share matching 
plan (the SMP ) and a performance share plan (the PSP ) to motivate 
long-term performance. Finally, a few shareholders continue to raise 
questions about the severance terms of the Chief Executive's contract. 
We set out in considerable detail in last year's report the reasons behind 
the above average salary increases granted that year to the Chief 
Executive and the Group Finance Director. Before making these awards 
we had consulted with our largest shareholders who were supportive of 
the proposals and the reasons behind them. We were thus disappointed 
that a minority of other investors decided to oppose the plans, in a 
number of cases simply because of the magnitude involved and 
irrespective of the reasoning. This year's review of salary levels for the 
Executive Directors has resulted in awards of 3.0%. This is below the 
level awarded on average across the Group.
Certain investors have raised a concern over the fact that the PSP and the 
SMP (which have been approved by shareholders in previous AGMs) have 
the same performance conditions and they see it that individuals are 
thus being awarded twice for the same performance. We do not see it 
that way. To support the Company's key strategic objectives the 
Committee believes it is important that over the long-term executives 
are incentivised to, and rewarded for, delivering shareholder return and 
improved financial performance of the Wireless division. To further 
increase alignment with shareholders the Committee believes it is 
necessary that a portion of the long-term incentive potential should be 
subject to a significant personal investment by the Executive Director. 
Accordingly, the long-term incentive arrangement has been designed 
with two elements. Directors are granted awards under the PSP as part 
of their long-term incentive programme. The SMP then allows them to 
increase their risk/opportunity under that same incentive programme 
through committing their own cash in terms of personal investment. This 
is deliberately designed to encourage equity participation by Directors 
and to align their interests with those  of shareholders.
The severance terms of the Chief Executive's contract are historical, and 
reflect accepted practice as it was when he was recruited ten years ago. 
We have said for some years that they are not terms that we would use 
for new recruits and evidenced this with the contract awarded to the 
Group Finance Director when he was recruited in 2009. To change  
the Chief Executive's contract however would require us to pay 
compensation now for him giving up protections which may in practice 
never actually be used. We do not consider this in the best interests of 
shareholders and accordingly intend to maintain the status quo.
Over the next 12 months the Committee will be considering the final 
proposals under the BIS regulations and any changes that need to be 
made to remuneration policy and reporting. These changes will be 
considered under the leadership of the newly appointed Committee 
Chairman who will have my full support through the transition period.

Basis of preparation of this report
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006 and associated legislation, the principles of the 2010 Corporate 
Governance Code, and meets the relevant requirements of the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Services Authority. As required by the relevant 
legislation, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the 
AGM of the Company at which the financial statements will be presented 
for approval.
The Remuneration Committee has been kept up to date on the new 
regulations that BIS has proposed for remuneration reporting, and has 
decided to adopt a number of the proposals for this year's report. This 
report is split into two sections: the Policy section, detailing our 
remuneration objectives and how we plan to achieve them, and the 
Implementation section, detailing how we have applied our policy 
throughout the year. Both sections of the report will be submitted to 
shareholders for an advisory vote under one resolution at the AGM. 
Policy section
Main principles of our policy
The Company's objective is to attract, retain and incentivise high-calibre 
executives who can drive the business forward and increase shareholder 
value. To meet this objective, the Company follows three key principles:
 	 total rewards are designed to be competitive, with the remuneration 
package of each Executive Director and his direct reports 
benchmarked regularly against companies of a similar size and in 
similar markets;
 	 incentive-based rewards are seen as an important part of each 
Executive Director's remuneration package as they are designed to 
drive and reward exceptional performance; and
 	 long-term incentive arrangements are designed to align the interests 
of the Executive Directors and senior managers with those of the 
shareholders and to support the Company's business strategy.
The Committee also ensures that, when determining the Executive 
Directors' remuneration packages, due account is taken of pay and 
employment conditions elsewhere in the Group. In this regard, the 
Committee ensures, via the Chief Executive's and Group Finance 
Director's attendance at certain meetings, that it is kept fully abreast  
of all relevant Group-wide remuneration-related issues.
The Committee ensures that remuneration structures neither encourage 
nor reward inappropriate operational risk-taking and are applied with due 
account taken of the Company's risk policies and systems. In addition, 
the Committee ensures that the incentive structures for Executive 
Directors and senior managers will not raise environmental, social or 
governance (ESG ) risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible 
behaviour. More generally, with regard to overall remuneration 
structures, there is no restriction on the Committee that prevents  
it from taking into account ESG matters.
Reward structure
The Executive Directors' total remuneration packages consist of:
 	 base salary; 
 	 annual performance bonus; 
 	 pension contributions (Group Finance Director only); 
 	 other benefits and allowances; and 
 	 share-based long-term incentive arrangements.
How shareholder's views are taken into account
The Chairman of the Committee meets with a number of major investors 
from time to time to discuss remuneration and incentive plans for the 
executives, giving them the opportunity to raise any related issues of 
concern. In arriving at the proposals for the current year, the Committee 
has also taken note of the specific issues that it understands were the 
subject of last year's shareholder concerns.  Anite plc

1 Under the SMP, since 1 May 2010, executives may invest up to 90% of base salary in any rolling three-year period (i.e. an average annual level of co-investment of 30% per annum, with 
the opportunity to invest a higher amount in any of the three financial years). In 2010, Mr Humphrey invested 90% of salary and Mr Amos 60%. In 2011, Mr Amos invested a further 
30%, taking his investment up to the maximum of 90% of salary. As both Mr Humphrey and Mr Amos had reached their three-year investment limit no SMP awards were made in 2012. 
In July 2013 Mr Humphrey and Mr Amos will be given the opportunity to invest up to a maximum of 90% and 60% of base salary respectively in a new SMP award, details of which are 
set out on page 52.
Non-Executive Directors 
The following table details the Company's approach to setting Non-Executive Director remuneration. There has been no change in the policy for 
Non-Executive Directors in the year. Fees were last increased on 1 May 2011. Full details on Non-Executive Director fees are set out on page 53.

1 Contractual benefits for Christopher Humphrey alone include the annual performance 
bonus he would have received had he continued to be employed from the date of 
termination until the expiry of the notice period.
2 Payments cease, in effect, if the Executive Director commences employment with a new 
employer during the payment period.
Other than in the case of dismissal for gross misconduct, the provisions 
of Mr Humphrey's service contract will be honoured in full. These legacy 
contractual provisions were agreed many years ago when standard 
practice for service contracts was different to current prevailing 
corporate governance standards.
The Company adopted the above described approach to determining the 
compensation that is payable in the event that Mr Humphrey's service 
contract is terminated as it believed at the time of agreeing his contract 
that it was in shareholders' interests that the maximum obligations of 
each party in such circumstances were transparent and agreed in 
advance to provide certainty.
If the Company terminates Mr Humphrey's employment without cause, 
the Committee will be asked to exercise any discretion it has under the 
terms of any share incentive plans in his favour. If the Remuneration 
Committee determines not to follow this recommendation, he shall 
be entitled to damages.
The Company is aware of the provisions now in place for the UK Corporate 
Governance Code which states that compensation payments should 
reflect a departing Director's obligation to mitigate his loss. However, the 
Committee considers that the cost of amending Mr Humphrey's contract 
in respect of the above (including the cost of any compensation he might 
be entitled to claim) could outweigh the existing termination costs under 
his contract and therefore such a change is not the most economical 
solution for shareholders.
These terms do not apply to Mr Amos; the provisions in his contract 
reflect the Committee's standard ongoing policy for new Executive 
Director appointments, which are fully compliant with the provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code. These are that, in the event of 
termination without cause, he would be entitled to 12 months' salary 
only, paid in monthly instalments and with mitigation. There are no 
obligations on the Remuneration Committee to exercise its discretion  
in respect of the terms of the share incentive plans.
Mr Brendish has a three-year term of office with six months' notice of 
termination required by either party. Mr Hurst-Brown, Mr Clifford and 
Mr Taylor each have a three-year term of office with no notice period 
or provision for compensation for loss of office.
Details of the appointment/reappointment of the Non-Executive 
Directors are set out on pages 36 and 37.

This section of the report illustrates how the Company has implemented 
its remuneration policy as detailed on page 47.
Remit of the Committee
The principal function of the Committee is to make recommendations 
to the Board on the remuneration policy for Executive Directors. It is 
also responsible for setting the individual remuneration packages for the 
Chairman (in his absence), for certain other members of the executive 
management, and for monitoring and approving the operation of all 
share-based incentive arrangements. The Committee also determines 
the terms and conditions of employment of the Executive Directors.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference which are 
posted on the Company's website.

the next AGM, having served on the Committee for nine years.
External advisers
New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Hewitt Limited, part of 
Aon plc) and Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PWC ) are the Committee's 
independent advisers on executive remuneration and employee share 
schemes. Neither New Bridge Street nor any other part of Aon plc nor 
PWC provided other services to the Company during the year. The Group 
Finance Director provides the Committee with information and 
assistance and only attends meetings by invitation. The Chief Executive 
regularly attends meetings, by invitation, to provide his insight on 
business objectives, the individual performance of his direct reports and 
pay and conditions throughout the Group. No individual is present when 
their own remuneration is being specifically discussed.
Base salary
The remuneration review conducted in the year resulted in the award of 
a 3% increase for the executives in their base salaries from 1 May 2013:
 	 Christopher Humphrey -  386,250 
 	 Richard Amos -  257,500
This compared to average salary increases at 1 May 2013 for all staff 
in the Group of around 3.6%. 
Annual bonus for year ending 30 April 2013
Under the terms of the Plan, for the year ended 30 April 2013, a bonus 
of up to 125% of salary could be earned - 100% for profit achievement 
compared to a stretching profit before tax target set as part of the annual 
budget and strategy work and 25% for achieving personal objectives that 
were agreed at the beginning of the new financial year.

Remuneration Committee report continued
The actual performance for the year ended 30 April 2013 resulted in 
the adjusted profit before tax exceeding the prior year's adjusted profit 
before tax by 22.5% resulting in a profit bonus payment of 51% of salary.
 
The Committee reviewed performance against the personal objectives 
set for Mr Humphrey which included strategic, customer-facing and 
investor-based objectives. They considered that these had been achieved 
and therefore awarded him the maximum of 25% of salary.
The Committee reviewed the personal objectives set for Mr Amos which 
were more operationally based and included HR, employee benefit, 
treasury and IP management projects. They considered these had been 
achieved and therefore awarded him the maximum of 25% of salary.
For the financial year ending 30 April 2014 the Plan will again be 
primarily based on the achievement of stretching profit growth targets. 
At budget profit level, which reflects significant growth over the past 
year's achievement, 30% of salary will be paid, with the maximum profit 
bonus only being awarded if the budgeted performance is exceeded by 
12%, at which level a maximum of 105% of salary would be paid. In 
addition, up to 20% will be based on the achievement of agreed personal 
objectives. While the exact targets cannot be disclosed for reasons of 
commercial sensitivity, they are tied to the strategic objectives and key 
performance indicators of the Group. The Committee believes these 
targets are appropriately stretching and if delivered will represent value 
creation for shareholders.
Long-term incentive awards
Awards granted under the PSP and SMP are subject to three-year 
performance conditions. The performance conditions for the awards 
made in 2012 and forthcoming 2013 awards are set out below. The 
conditions applying to awards made prior to 2012 are set out as 
footnotes to the table of PSP and SMP interests on page 54.
PSP 2012 Awards performance conditions
a) Half of the award is based on the Company's relative TSR compared 
with the FTSE techMARK index. 
b) Half of the award is based on the sum of the Profit before interest and 
tax  (PBIT ) of the Wireless division in each of the three financial 
years of the performance period (2013, 2014 and 2015).
Proportion of 
award vesting TSR PBIT of Wireless division 
0% Below median Less than  105m
25% Median  105m
25%-100% Between median and  
upper quartile
Between  105m and  120m
100% Upper quartile or above  120m or above
Performance to date
If 30 April 2013 were the end of the performance period:
1) The Company's TSR over the performance period to date would have 
placed it between median and upper quartile of the comparator group, 
which would result in 43.5% of this element of the award vesting.
2) Total PBIT of Wireless division for 2013, 2014 and 2015 to date of 
 31.9m would represent 27% of the proportion of upper end of 
target range to be achieved over the performance period.
PSP & SMP 2013 Awards performance conditions
The Committee considered that for 2013 it is appropriate and necessary 
for Long-Term Incentive awards to continue to be subject to relative TSR 
performance and the financial performance of the Wireless division. 
As mentioned in the Chairman's letter, the award of both Performance 
Shares and Matching Shares forms part of an overall long-term incentive 
strategy which further rewards executives for investing in the Company's 
shares. Accordingly, the Committee believes it is appropriate, to reflect 
this overall strategy, for both Performance Share awards and Matching 
Share awards to be subject to the same performance condition, The 
targets against both of these measures are as follows:
a) Half of the award will be based on the Company's relative TSR 
compared with the FTSE techMARK index. 
b) Half of the award will be based on the sum of the PBIT of the Wireless 
division in each of the three financial years of the performance period 
(2014, 2015 and 2016).
Proportion of 
award vesting TSR PBIT of Wireless division 
0% Below median Less than  115m
15% -  115m
15%-25% Median Between  115m and  120m
25%-100% Between median and  
upper quartile
Between  120m and  135m
100% Upper quartile or above  135m or above
In addition, the Committee will also carry out a qualitative assessment 
of the performance of the Group as a whole when deciding whether to 
release the shares under the PBIT element of the PSP and SMP. This will 
ensure that there has been no event outside the Wireless division that 
would make a vesting inappropriate.
In the event that acquisitions or disposals are made during the three-year 
period, the Committee may, with appropriate financial advice, make 
adjustments to the PBIT target. Furthermore, the PBIT target will be 
measured on a consistent basis with respect to intercompany charges 
and exceptional items. Anite plc
Annual report and accounts 2013 53
Business overview
Governance
Financial statements
Finally, in the event of a change in control of the Company, the Committee can decide to determine vesting of the entire awards by reference to the 
TSR performance conditions (if, for example, it proves impractical to measure performance against PBIT targets at the relevant time).
The Committee will keep the structure and operation of the Company's share incentive arrangements under regular review to ensure they take due 
account of market/best practice and the Company's strategic and risk management objectives and do not encourage excessive operational risk taking.
Achievement of 2010 PSP and SMP performance targets
Based on the results to 30 April 2013 both the TSR and profit targets required under the 2010 PSP and SMP schemes were achieved and therefore 
both these awards will vest in full (for details see note 2 on page 55).

2. PSP and SMP awards 2010 performance conditions 
a) Half of the award is based on the Company's relative TSR compared with the FTSE 
All-Share Software and Computer Services Sector,
b) Half of the award is based on the adjusted PBIT performance of the Wireless division 
and split into two parts.
Proportion of 
award vesting TSR (50% of award)
PBIT of Wireless division 
(37.5% of award)
0% Below median Less than  42.5m
25% Median  42.5m
25%-100% Between median and  
upper quartile
Between  42.5m and  50m
100% Upper quartile or above  50m or above
The final 12.5% of the PBIT element of the award will be paid if in any one year of the 
performance period the PBIT of the Wireless division is in excess of  23.4m (which was the 
sum of the record years of PBIT the Handset and Network Testing businesses achieved in 
2007 and 2009 respectively).
Based on the performance to 30 April 2013 Anite's TSR was in the upper quartile of the 
comparator group and the profit achieved over the three years was  75m. The single year 
target of  23.4m was achieved in 2012. These awards will therefore vest in full on the 
vesting date.
3 . PSP and SMP awards 2011 performance conditions 
a) Half of the award is based on the Company's relative TSR compared with the FTSE 
All-Share Software and Computer Services Sector.
b) Half of the award is based on the adjusted PBIT performance of the Wireless division 
and split into two parts.
Proportion of 
award vesting TSR (50% of award)
PBIT of Wireless division

25% Median  54m
25%-100% Between median and  
upper quartile
Between  54m and  64m
100% Upper quartile or above  64m or above
The final 12.5% of the PBIT element of the award will be paid if in any one year of the 
performance period the PBIT of the Wireless division is in excess of  23.4m (which was the 
sum of the record years of PBIT the Handset and Network Testing businesses achieved in 
2007 and 2009 respectively).
Performance to date
If 30 April 2013 were the end of the performance period:
1)  The Company's TSR over the performance period to date would have placed it in the top 
quartile of the comparator group, which would result in 100% of this element of the 
award vesting.
2) Total PBIT of Wireless division to date for 2012, 2013 and 2014 performance target is 
 58.7m and represents 92% of the proportion of upper end of target range to be 
achieved over the performance period.
3) In respect of final measure above, the 2012 PBIT result for the Wireless division was 
 26.8m, exceeding the performance target required of  23.4m. This element will 
therefore vest at the end of the performance period.
Share ownership guidelines
To provide a further alignment of interest with shareholders, the 
Executive Directors participating in the PSP and SMP, when exercising an 
award, are required to retain in shares an amount equal in value to 50% 
of the after-tax gain made until they have built up a shareholding equal 
to 100% of base salary. Both Executive Directors held in excess of 100% 
of salary in shares at the date of this report.
The use of new issue or treasury shares to satisfy awards made under the 
share plans is subject to a 15% dilution limit in any ten-year period. The 
current potential dilution is well below this level. The Committee, aware 
of shareholders' views in connection with this matter, continues to take 
active steps to control the dilutive effect of the Company's share 
incentives and is currently working under an informal dilution limit of 
10%. The actual potential dilution is currently 5.4% (2012: 7.7%) and of 
this only 1.49% have to be settled by shares, the balance can be settled 
by either market purchase or new issue shares.

Broadly, shareholder concerns fell into three categories: the salary 
increases awarded last year to the Executive Directors; the fact that 
certain shareholders have concerns around the fact that we use both 
a SMP and a PSP; and issues that certain shareholders continue to raise 
regarding the severance terms of the Chief Executive's contract. The 
Company has considered these concerns and sets out a detailed response 
in the Chairman's Letter on page 46. 
Salaries for the Executive Directors were increased by 3% on 1 May 2013, 
which compares to a Group average salary increase of 3.6%.
