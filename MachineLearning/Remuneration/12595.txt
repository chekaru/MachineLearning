The options, granted during the year, to SA Woodward had additional vesting criteria based on a revenue target for 2009 that was not met. 
Therefore these options lapsed on 31 December 2009.
Options granted after March 2005 vest over a three year period, are subject to continued employment with the Company for
the duration of this period, and corporate performance criteria based on an increase in Group revenues over that period.
The options expire after 10 years and there are no cash settlement alternatives. The share price at the year end was 29p.
The highest and lowest market price during the year for the ordinary shares was 52.5p and 21.5p respectively.
During the year the number of options exercised by the directors was 60,000 (2008: nil), which had a total exercise value of
 3. This gave an aggregate gain of  15,597. During the period 25,600 options with an exercise price of 0.85p and a total
exercise value of  21,760, held by SA Woodward lapsed.
