The interest of the directors in share options is detailed below:
Options granted after March 2005 vest over a three year period, are subject to continued employment with the Company for the 
duration of this period, and corporate performance criteria based on an increase in Group revenues over that period.   
The options expire after 10 years and there are no cash settlement alternatives.  The share price at the year end was 16.75p.  
The highest and lowest market price during the year for the ordinary shares was 32p and 15p respectively.
During the year the number of options exercised by the directors was nil (2010: nil), which had a total exercise value of  
 nil (2010:  nil). This gave an aggregate gain of  nil (2010:  nil).
