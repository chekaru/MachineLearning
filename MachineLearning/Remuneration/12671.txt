Report on Remuneration and Related Matters
This report meets the requirements of the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the
Regulations ). It also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority
and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best Practice 
(the Combined Code ) relating to directors' remuneration.
During the year under review, the Company complied with the detailed code provisions set out in Section B 
of the Combined Code except as follows:
  As explained on page 55, performance related pay measures did not apply to Executive Directors (provision
B.1.1).
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company's members on the auditable part  of this report
and to state whether in their opinion that part has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations). The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for
unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited Information
Remuneration Committee 
Membership
The membership of the Remuneration Committee during the year was as follows:
Mr. G S Menendez (Chairman);
Mr. C H Bailey; and
Mr. D E Yarur.
Mr. Menendez, Mr. Bailey and Mr. Yarur were considered by the Board to be independent Non-Executive
Directors throughout 2005.
Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are fully set out in its Terms of Reference which are
available on the Company's website. The Committee is responsible for setting remuneration policy and
reviewing the remuneration of the Executive Directors and in doing so, it consults the Chairman, Mr. J-P Luksic.
The Remuneration Committee is also responsible for monitoring the level and structure of remuneration of
Group senior management and evaluating management performance.
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board as a whole. No Director participates 
in the determination of his own remuneration. 
Company Policy on Directors' Pay and Bonuses
The Company's policy is to ensure that Directors are fairly rewarded with regard to responsibilities undertaken,
and considers comparable pay levels in the United Kingdom and in Chile. Corporate and individual performance
are taken into account in setting pay levels for each Executive Director, and this is reviewed on an annual basis.
Remuneration levels for Non-Executive Directors are based on comparable levels for companies of a similar size
and complexity, and also take into account specific responsibilities undertaken.
The Board does not consider it appropriate to make regular performance-related pay awards such as bonuses 
to the only Executive Director, Mr. J-P Luksic, given his role as Chairman of the Board. The Board also did 
not make any performance-related pay awards to Mr. P J Adeane, who was an Executive Director until his
retirement on 31 March 2005 and a Non-Executive Director thereafter. As explained on page 59, the Board
awarded an ex-gratia payment of  100,000 (US$181,850) on retirement in recognition of his long and
outstanding service to the Group.

The Group has paid Mr. R F Jara for advisory services to the Group. The Board has taken these payments into
account in determining his fees as a Non-Executive Director.
No Directors currently receive pension contributions.
Service Contracts
Mr. J-P Luksic has a contract for services with the Antofagasta Railway Company plc. The current contract 
for services has a one month notice period. There is also a contract between Antofagasta Minerals S.A. and
Asesorias Ramon F Jara EIRL for the provision of advisory services by Mr. R F Jara which also has a one 
month notice period.
No other Directors have service contracts with the Company and therefore no other notice periods apply.
Share Options and Long-term Incentive Schemes
No arrangements exist either to enable Directors to acquire benefits through the acquisition of shares in the
Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, to benefit through profit-related pay or share option schemes 
or to participate in any long-term incentive schemes.
Directors' Interests
The Directors' beneficial interests, including family interests, in the shares of the Company at the beginning and
end of the year were as follows:

Company or its subsidiary undertakings during the year other than in the ordinary course of business.

Performance Graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance compared to the performance of the FTSE All Share
Index over a five-year period, measured by total shareholder return (as defined below). The FTSE All Share Index
has been selected as an appropriate benchmark as it is the most broadly based index to which the Company
belongs and which relates to the London Stock Exchange, the market where the Company's ordinary shares 
are traded.
Total shareholder return is calculated to show a theoretical growth in the value of a shareholding over a specified
period, assuming that dividends are reinvested to purchase additional shares at the closing price applicable on
the ex-dividend date. Total shareholder return for the FTSE All Share Index is calculated by aggregating the
returns of all individual constituents of the FTSE at the end of the five-year period.
