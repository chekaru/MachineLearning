 Antofagasta plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007
72
This report has been prepared in accordance with
Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985. It also meets
the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority and describes how the
Board has applied the principles of good governance
as set out in the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council
in June 2006 (the Combined Code ) relating to
directors' remuneration.
During the year under review, the Company complied
with the detailed code provisions set out in Section B
of the Combined Code except as follows:
  as explained on page 71, performance related pay
measures did not apply to the Chairman, who was
the only Executive Director (provision B.1.1).
The Companies Act 1985 requires the auditors to
report to the Company's members on certain parts of
this report and to state whether in their opinion those
parts have been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985. The report has therefore
been divided into separate sections for unaudited 
and audited information.
Unaudited Information
Remuneration Committee
Membership
The Remuneration Committee currently comprises
Mr. G S Menendez (Chairman), Mr. C H Bailey and
Mr. D E Yarur, all of whom are considered by the 
Board to be independent Non-Executive Directors.
Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee
are fully set out in its Terms of Reference which are
available from the Company's registered office and
may be viewed on the Company's website -
www.antofagasta.co.uk. The Committee is
responsible for setting remuneration policy and 
for reviewing the remuneration of any Executive
Directors and, where appropriate, it consults the
Chairman, Mr. J-P Luksic. The Committee did not
make use of external consultants to provide advice
on Directors' remuneration during the year. The
Remuneration Committee is also responsible for
monitoring the level and structure of remuneration 
of Group senior management and evaluating
management performance. 
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is
determined by the Board as a whole. No Director
participates in the determination of his own
remuneration. 
Company policy on Directors' pay and bonuses
The Company's policy is to ensure that Directors 
are fairly rewarded with regard to responsibilities
undertaken, and considers comparable pay levels 
in the United Kingdom and in Chile. Corporate and
individual performance is taken into account in setting
the pay level for the Chairman as an Executive
Director, and this is reviewed on an annual basis to
ensure it remains in line with companies of a similar
size and complexity. Remuneration levels for
Non-Executive Directors are based on comparable
levels for companies of a similar size and complexity,
and take into account specific responsibilities
undertaken. Remuneration includes fees paid for
non-executive directorships of subsidiary companies
within the Group.
The Board does not consider it appropriate to make
regular performance-related pay awards such as
bonuses to the only Executive Director, Mr. J-P Luksic,
given his role as Chairman of the Board and his
interest in the Company's shares both directly and 
as a member of the Luksic family. 
The Group has paid Mr. R F Jara for advisory services
to the Group. The Board has taken these payments
into account in determining his fees as a
Non-Executive Director.
No Directors currently receive pension contributions.

REMUNERATION REPORT
All Non-Executive Directors have letters of
appointment with the Company, for an initial period of
three years from the date of their appointment, subject
to reappointment at the AGM. These letters require
the Non-Executive Directors to undertake that they will
have sufficient time to discharge their responsibilities.
The appointments are terminable by either party on
one month's notice. The letters of appointment are
available for inspection at the Company's registered
office during normal business hours and at the AGM
(for 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting).
The service contacts and letters of appointment do not
provide for any compensation for loss of office beyond
payments in lieu of notice.
Share options and long-term incentive
schemes
No arrangements exist to enable Directors to acquire
benefits through the acquisition of shares in the
Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, to
benefit through profit-related pay or share option
schemes or to participate in any long-term incentive
schemes.

Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company's
performance compared to the performance of the
FTSE All Share Index over a five-year period, measured
by total shareholder return (as defined below). The
FTSE All Share Index has been selected as an
appropriate benchmark as it is the most broadly based
index to which the Company belongs and which
relates to the London Stock Exchange, the market
where the Company's ordinary shares are traded.
Total shareholder return is calculated to show a
theoretical growth in the value of a shareholding over a
specified period, assuming that dividends are reinvested
to purchase additional shares at the closing price
applicable on the ex-dividend date. Total shareholder
return for the FTSE All-Share Index is calculated by
aggregating the returns of all individual constituents 
of the FTSE at the end of the five-year period.

Directors' remuneration
The remuneration of the Directors in the year is set out
below in US dollars. Amounts paid in sterling or Chilean
pesos have been translated at average rates for the
relevant year, which are set out in Note 36 to the
financial statements. Increases over 2006 result mainly
from the annual review by the Remuneration
Committee carried out at the beginning of 2007 to
ensure that pay levels remain in line with companies 
of a similar size and complexity. The annual review for
2008 which has been carried out by the Remuneration
Committee in early 2008 has concluded that no further
increase in the rate of fees will be made in 2008.
