Remuneration Report
This report has been prepared in accordance with
Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985. It also meets
the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority and describes how the
Board has applied the principles of good governance
as set out in the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council
in June 2006 (the Combined Code ) relating to
Directors' remuneration.
During the year under review, the Company complied
with the detailed code provisions set out in Section B
of the Combined Code except, as explained on page 64,
performance related pay measures did not apply to the
Chairman, who was the only Executive Director
(provision B.1.1).
The Companies Act 1985 requires the auditors to
report to the Company's members on certain parts of
this report and to state whether in their opinion those
parts have been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985. The report has therefore
been divided into separate sections for unaudited
and audited information.
Unaudited Information
Remuneration Committee
Membership
The Remuneration Committee currently comprises 
Mr. G S Menendez (Chairman), Mr. C H Bailey and
Mr. D E Yarur, all of whom are considered by the 
Board to be independent Non-Executive Directors.
Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee
are fully set out in its Terms of Reference which are
available from the Company's registered office and
may be viewed on the Company's website -
www.antofagasta.co.uk. The Committee is responsible
for setting remuneration policy and for reviewing the
remuneration of any Executive Directors and, where
appropriate, it consults the Chairman, Mr. J-P Luksic.
The Committee used benchmarking data from various
sources, but did not appoint external consultants to
advise on Directors' remuneration during the year. 
The Remuneration Committee is also responsible for
monitoring the level and structure of remuneration
of Group senior management and evaluating
management performance. 
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is
determined by the Board as a whole. No Director
participates in the determination of his own
remuneration. 
Company policy on Directors' pay and bonuses
The Company's policy is to ensure that Directors
are fairly rewarded with regard to responsibilities
undertaken, and considers comparable pay levels in
the United Kingdom, in Chile, and in the international
mining industry. Corporate and individual performance
is taken into account in setting the pay level for the
Chairman as an Executive Director, and this is
reviewed on an annual basis to ensure it remains
in line with companies of a similar nature, size and
complexity. Remuneration levels for Non-Executive
Directors are based on comparable levels for
companies of a similar nature, size and complexity, and
take into account specific responsibilities undertaken.
Remuneration includes fees paid for non-executive
directorships of subsidiary companies and joint
ventures within the Group.
The Board does not consider it appropriate to make
regular performance-related pay awards such as
bonuses to the only Executive Director, Mr. J-P Luksic,
given his role as Chairman of the Board and his
interest in the Company's shares both directly and
as a member of the Luksic family. 
The Group has paid Mr. R F Jara for advisory services
to the Group. The Board has taken these payments
into account in determining his fees as a 
Non-Executive Director.
No Director currently receives pension contributions.

Non-Executive Directors' fees
The fees payable to Non-Executive Directors were
as follows:
2008 2007
US$000 US$000
Base fee 100 100
Audit committee chairman 20 20
Audit committee member 10 10
Remuneration committee chairman 16 16
Remuneration committee member 10 10
Nomination committee chairman 10 10
Nomination committee member 4 4
These fees were redenominated into US dollars during
2008 in order to reflect the international nature of the
Group's operations and the location of the majority of
its Directors. Prior to this, fees paid were denominated
in sterling. For the purposes of the table above, the
amounts for 2008 represent the US dollar fees in 
place following the redenomination and the amounts
for 2007 represent the sterling fees translated into
US dollars at the average exchange rate for that year.
Fee levels will be unchanged for 2009.
In addition to the above amounts, Non-Executive
Directors also receive fees in their capacity as
Non-Executive Directors of the principal operating
subsidiary companies and joint ventures within the
Group. These additional fees are included within the
amounts attributable to the Non-Executive Directors
within the table of Directors' remuneration on page 68.
Service contracts and letters of appointment
Mr. J-P Luksic has a contract for services with both 
the Antofagasta Railway Company plc and Antofagasta
Minerals S.A. Both contracts for services can be
terminated by either party on one month's notice.
The contract with Antofagasta Minerals S.A. replaced
a previous contract with Minera El Tesoro with effect
from 1 April 2008 at the same monthly rate. No
additional amounts were paid to Mr. Luksic on the
termination of the contract with Minera El Tesoro.
There is also a contract between Antofagasta Minerals
S.A. and Asesor as Ram n F Jara Ltda for the provision
of advisory services by Mr. R F Jara which can also
be terminated on one month's notice. The amounts
payable under these contracts for services are
adjusted in line with Chilean inflation, and are also
reviewed periodically in line with the Company's policy
on Directors' pay. Amounts paid during 2007 and 2008
have been included in the table of Directors'
remuneration on page 68.
All Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment
with the Company, for an initial period of three years from
the date of their appointment, subject to reappointment
at the Annual General Meeting (AGM ). These letters
require the Non-Executive Directors to undertake that
they will have sufficient time to discharge their
responsibilities. The appointments may be terminated
by either party on one month's notice. The letters of
appointment are available for inspection at the Company's
registered office during normal business hours and at the
AGM (for 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting).
The service contracts and letters of appointment do
not provide for any compensation for loss of office
beyond payments in lieu of notice, and therefore the
maximum amount payable upon termination of these
contracts is limited to one month's payment.
Share options and long-term incentive schemes
No arrangements exist to enable Directors to acquire
benefits through the acquisition of shares in the
Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, to benefit
through profit-related pay or share option schemes or
to participate in any long-term incentive schemes.
Directors' interests
The Directors' interests in the shares of the Company
at the beginning and end of the year were as follows:
Ordinary shares of 5p each

Establishment, an entity which he controls.
The Directors had no interests in the shares of the
Company during the year other than the interests in
the table set out above. No Director had any material
interest in any other contract with the Company or its
subsidiary undertakings during the year other than in
the ordinary course of business.
No changes took place in the interests of the Directors
between 31 December 2008 and the date of this report.

Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance
compared to the performance of the FTSE All Share
Index over a five-year period, measured by total
shareholder return (as defined below). The FTSE
All Share Index has been selected as an appropriate
benchmark as it is the most broadly based index to
which the Company belongs and which relates to the
London Stock Exchange, the market where the
Company's ordinary shares are traded.
Total shareholder return is calculated to show a
theoretical growth in the value of a shareholding over a
specified period, assuming that dividends are reinvested
to purchase additional shares at the closing price
applicable on the ex-dividend date. Total shareholder
return for the FTSE All-Share Index is calculated by
aggregating the returns of all individual constituents 
of the FTSE at the end of the five-year period.

Directors' remuneration
The remuneration of the Directors in the year is set
out below in US dollars. Amounts paid in sterling and
Chilean pesos have been translated at average rates
for the relevant year, which are set out in Note 37 to
the financial statements. As explained above, during
2008 the Directors' fees paid by Antofagasta plc were
redenominated from sterling into US dollars. Increases
over 2007 result mainly from inflation-linked increases
in respect of the amounts paid to Mr. J-P Luksic and
Mr. R F Jara under their service contracts, and fees
paid to Directors for additional services as directors of
subsidiary companies and joint ventures of the Group.
