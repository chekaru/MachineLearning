Remuneration Report
Company policy on Directors' pay and bonuses
The Company's policy is to ensure that Directors are fairly rewarded with 
regard to responsibilities undertaken, and considers comparable pay levels 
in the United Kingdom, in Chile, and in the international mining industry. 
Corporate and individual performance is taken into account in setting the pay 
level for the Chairman as an Executive Director, and this is reviewed on an 
annual basis to ensure it remains in line with companies of a similar nature, 
size and complexity. Remuneration levels for Non-Executive Directors are 
based on comparable levels for companies of a similar nature, size and 
complexity, and take into account specific responsibilities undertaken. 
Remuneration includes fees paid for non-executive directorships of subsidiary 
companies and joint ventures within the Group. The Board does not consider 
it appropriate to make regular performance-related pay awards such as 
bonuses to the only Executive Director, Mr. J-P Luksic, given his role as 
Chairman of the Board and his interest in the Company's shares both directly 
and as a member of the Luksic family. The Group has paid Mr. RF Jara for 
advisory services to the Group. The Board has taken these payments into 
account in determining his fees as a Non-Executive Director. No Director 
currently receives pension contributions.
Non-Executive Directors' fees
The fees payable to Non-Executive Directors in respect of Antofagasta plc 
were as follows:
2009 
US$000
2008 
US$000
Base fee 100 100
Audit Committee chairman 20 20
Audit Committee member 10 10
Remuneration Committee chairman 16 16
Remuneration Committee member 10 10
Nomination Committee chairman 10 10
Nomination Committee member 4 4
These fee levels will be unchanged for 2010. 
In addition to the above amounts, Non-Executive Directors also receive  
fees in their capacity as Non-Executive Directors of the principal operating 
subsidiary companies and joint ventures within the Group. As some of these 
fees are set in Chilean pesos, the US dollar payments made in respect of 
such fees may vary depending on the applicable exchange rate from time 
to time. These additional fees are included within the amounts attributable 
to the Non-Executive Directors within the table of Directors' remuneration 
on page 61.
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008. It also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has 
applied the principles of good governance as set out in the Combined Code 
on Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council in June 
2008 (the Combined Code ) relating to Directors' remuneration. 
During the year under review, the Company complied with the detailed code 
provisions set out in Section B of the Combined Code except, as explained on 
page 58, performance related pay measures did not apply to the Chairman, 
who was the only Executive Director (provision B.1.1). 
The Companies Act 2006 requires the auditors to report to the Company's 
members on certain parts of this report and to state whether in their opinion 
those parts have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006. The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for 
unaudited and audited information.

Remuneration Report
The Directors had no interests in the shares of the Company during the 
year other than the interests in the table set out above. No Director had any

Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance compared to the 
performance of the FTSE All Share Index over a five-year period, measured 
by total shareholder return (as defined below). The FTSE All Share Index has 
been selected as an appropriate benchmark as it is the most broadly based 
index to which the Company belongs and which relates to the London Stock 
Exchange, the market where the Company's ordinary shares are traded. 
Total  shareholder return is calculated to show a theoretical growth in the 
value of a shareholding over a specified period, assuming that dividends are 
reinvested to purchase additional shares at the closing price applicable on 
the  ex-dividend date. Total shareholder return for the FTSE All-Share Index 
is  calculated by aggregating the returns of all individual constituents of the 
FTSE at the end of the five-year period.

Service contracts and letters of appointment
Mr. J-P Luksic has a contract for services with both the Antofagasta Railway 
Company plc and Antofagasta Minerals S.A. Both contracts for services can 
be terminated by either party on one month's notice. There is also a contract 
between Antofagasta Minerals S.A. and Asesor as Ram n F Jara Ltda for the 
provision of advisory services by Mr. R F Jara which can also be terminated 
on one month's notice. The amounts payable under these contracts for 
services are denominated in Chilean pesos and as is typical for employment 
contracts or contracts for services in Chile, are adjusted in line with Chilean 
inflation, and are also reviewed periodically in line with the Company's policy 
on Directors' pay although no changes were made in 2009 as compared 
with previous years. Amounts paid during 2008 and 2009 have been 
included in the table of Directors' remuneration on page 61. 
All Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment with the Company, 
for an initial period of three years from the date of their appointment, subject 
to reappointment at the Annual General Meeting (AGM ). These letters 
require the Non-Executive Directors to undertake that they will have sufficient 
time to discharge their responsibilities. The appointments may be terminated 
by either party on one month's notice. The letters of appointment are 
available for inspection at the Company's registered office during normal 
business hours and at the AGM (for 15 minutes prior to and during the 
meeting). The service contracts and letters of appointment do not provide for 
any compensation for loss of office beyond payments in lieu of notice, and 
therefore the maximum amount payable upon termination of these contracts 
is limited to one month's payment.
Share options and long-term incentive schemes
No arrangements exist to enable Directors to acquire benefits through the 
acquisition of shares in the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, 
to benefit through profit-related pay or share option schemes or to participate 
in any long-term incentive schemes.
Directors' interests
The Directors' interests in the shares of the Company at the beginning and 
end of the year were as follows:
