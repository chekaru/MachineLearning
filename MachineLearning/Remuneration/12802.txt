81 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008. It also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the 
principles of good governance as set out in the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2008 (the 
Combined Code ) relating to Directors' remuneration which applied to the 
Company during the 2010 financial year. The UK Corporate Governance 
Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2010 will apply to the 
Company from the 2011 financial year and will be reported upon in the 2011 
Annual Report and Financial Statements.
During the year under review, the Company complied with the detailed code 
provisions set out in Section B of the Combined Code except, as explained on 
page 80, performance-related pay measures did not apply to the Chairman, 
who was the only Executive Director (provision B.1.1). 
The Companies Act 2006 requires the auditors to report to the Company's 
members on certain parts of this report and to state whether in their opinion 
those parts have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006. The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for 
unaudited and audited information.

Remuneration Committee
Membership
The Remuneration Committee currently comprises Mr. G S Men ndez 
(Chairman), Mr. C H Bailey and Mr. W M Hayes, all of whom are considered 
by the Board to be independent Non-Executive Directors. Mr. W M Hayes 
replaced Mr. D E Yarur, who retired from the Remuneration Committee 
on 29 November 2010.
Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are fully set out in its 
Terms of Reference which are available from the Company's registered office 
and may be viewed on the Company's website - www.antofagasta.co.uk. 
The Committee is responsible for setting remuneration policy and for reviewing 
the remuneration of any Executive Directors and, where appropriate, it consults 
the Chairman, Mr. J-P Luksic. The Committee used benchmarking data from 
various sources, but did not appoint external consultants to advise on Directors' 
remuneration during the year. The Remuneration Committee is also responsible 
for monitoring the level and structure of remuneration of Group senior 
management and evaluating management performance. The remuneration 
of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board as a whole. No Director 
participates in the determination of his own remuneration.
Company policy on Directors' pay and bonuses
The Company's policy is to ensure that Directors are fairly rewarded with 
regard to responsibilities undertaken, and considers comparable pay levels in 
the United Kingdom, in Chile, and in the international mining industry. Corporate 
and individual performance is taken into account in setting the pay level for the 
Chairman as an Executive Director, and this is reviewed on an annual basis to 
ensure it remains in line with companies of a similar nature, size and complexity. 
Remuneration levels for Non-Executive Directors are based on comparable levels 
for companies of a similar nature, size and complexity, and take into account 
specific responsibilities undertaken. Remuneration includes fees paid for 
non-executive directorships of subsidiary companies and joint ventures 
within the Group. The Board does not consider it appropriate to make regular 
performance-related pay awards such as bonuses to the only Executive Director, 
Mr. J-P Luksic, given his role as Chairman of the Board and his interest in 
the Company's shares both directly and as a member of the Luksic family. 
The Group has paid Mr. R F Jara for advisory services to the Group. During the 
year, exceptional bonuses were paid in respect of Mr. Jara and to a number of 
long-serving senior executives recognising their contribution to long-term value 
creation of the Group over the years from the development of the Los Pelambres 
mine in the late 1990s to the commissioning of the Esperanza mine towards 
the end of 2010. The aggregate amount of the bonuses was US$8.8 million. 
No Director currently receives pension contributions.
Non-Executive Directors' fees
The fees payable to Non-Executive Directors in respect of Antofagasta plc 
were as follows:
2010 
US$000
2009 
US$000
Base fee 100 100
Audit Committee chairman 20 20
Audit Committee member 10 10
Remuneration Committee chairman 16 16
Remuneration Committee member 10 10
Nomination Committee chairman 10 10
Nomination Committee member 4 4
In addition to the above amounts, Non-Executive Directors also receive fees in 
their capacity as Non-Executive Directors of the principal operating subsidiary 
companies and joint ventures within the Group. As some of these fees are set 
in Chilean pesos, the US dollar payments made in respect of such fees may vary 
depending on the applicable exchange rate from time to time. These additional 
fees are included within the amounts attributable to the Directors within the table 
of Directors' remuneration on page 83.

Service contracts and letters of appointment
Mr. J-P Luksic has a contract for services with both the Antofagasta Railway 
Company plc and Antofagasta Minerals S.A. Both contracts for services can 
be terminated by either party on one month's notice. There is also a contract 
between Antofagasta Minerals S.A. and Asesor as Ram n F Jara Ltda for the 
provision of advisory services by Mr. R F Jara which can also be terminated on 
one month's notice. The amounts payable under these contracts for services 
are denominated in Chilean pesos and as is typical for employment contracts or 
contracts for services in Chile, are adjusted in line with Chilean inflation, and are 
also reviewed periodically in line with the Company's policy on Directors' pay 
although no changes were made in 2010. Amounts paid during 2009 and 
2010 have been included in the table of Directors' remuneration on page 83. 
All Non-Executive Directors (other than Mr. Men ndez, Mr. Bailey, Mr. Baker and 
Mr. Dryland) have letters of appointment with the Company, for an initial period 
of three years from the date of their appointment, subject to re-appointment 
at each Annual General Meeting (AGM ) during their period of appointment. 
Mr. Men ndez, Mr. Bailey, Mr. Baker and Mr. Dryland are each appointed for a 
one-year period from the date of their appointment, subject to re-appointment 
at the AGM following their appointment. The Company intends to comply with 
provision B.7 of the UK Corporate Governance Code from the 2011 financial 
year and submit each Director for annual re-election. These letters require 
the Non-Executive Directors to undertake that they will have sufficient time 
to discharge their responsibilities. The appointments may be terminated by 
either party on one month's notice. The letters of appointment are available for 
inspection at the Company's registered office during normal business hours 
and at the AGM (for 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting). The service 
contracts and letters of appointment do not provide for any compensation for loss 
of office beyond payments in lieu of notice, and therefore the maximum amount 
payable upon termination of these contracts is limited to one month's payment.
Share options and long-term incentive schemes
No arrangements exist to enable Directors to acquire benefits through the 
acquisition of shares in the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, 
to benefit through profit-related pay or share option schemes or to participate 
in any long-term incentive schemes.
Directors' interests
The Directors' interests in the shares of the Company at the beginning and end 
of the year were as follows:

Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance compared to the 
performance of the FTSE All-Share Index over a five-year period, measured by 
total shareholder return (as defined below). The FTSE All-Share Index has been 
selected as an appropriate benchmark as it is the most broadly based index to 
which the Company belongs and which relates to the London Stock Exchange, 
the market where the Company's ordinary shares are traded. Total shareholder 
return is calculated to show a theoretical growth in the value of a shareholding 
over a specified period, assuming that dividends are reinvested to purchase 
additional shares at the closing price applicable on the ex-dividend date. 
Total shareholder return for the FTSE All-Share Index is calculated by 
aggregating the returns of all individual constituents of the FTSE at the end 
of the five-year period.

*Total Shareholder Return represents share price growth plus dividends reinvested over the period.
