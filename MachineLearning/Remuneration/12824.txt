 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 82
Basis of preparation of this report and compliance
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. 
It also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles 
of good governance as set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code issued 
by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2010: 
During the year under review, the Company complied with the detailed code 
provisions set out in Section D of the UK Corporate Governance Code except, 
as explained on page 73:
 - The Chairman, who is the only Executive Director, did not receive any reward 
structured to vary with individual or corporate performance (principle D1); and 
 - Charles Bailey retired from the Board and also therefore from the Remuneration 
and Talent Committee on 8 June 2011. Additional appointments were made 
to the committees with effect from 1 July 2011, however for the intervening 22 
days the Committee did not comprise three independent Non-Executive Directors 
(provision D.2.1). No Committee meeting was held during this intervening period.
Unaudited information
Role and responsibilities of the Committee
The Remuneration and Talent Committee is responsible for setting 
remuneration policy and for reviewing the remuneration of any Executive Directors. 
The Committee is also responsible for monitoring the level and structure of 
remuneration of Group senior management. The Committee's terms of reference 
were reviewed during the year and updates were made with effect from 22 August 
2011. The terms of reference are available from the Company's registered office 
and may be viewed on the Company's website - www.antofagasta.co.uk. 
The terms of reference were updated to ensure they remain in line with current best 
practice, and the changes also include formalising the Committee's responsibilities 
for reviewing succession planning for senior management, reviewing any major 
changes in compensation policies applying across the Group's companies that 
have a significant long-term impact on labour costs, and reviewing compensation 
and talent management strategies. Reflecting these changes, the name of the 
Committee was changed during the year, from the Remuneration Committee to the 
Remuneration and Talent Committee. The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors 
is determined by the Board as a whole. No Director participates in the determination 
of their own remuneration. 
Company policy on Directors' pay and bonuses 
As discussed above within the Corporate Governance Report, as at the date of this 
report the Board had nine Directors, comprised of an Executive Chairman and eight 
Non-Executive Directors. The Company's approach to Directors' remuneration 
reflects this predominantly non-executive composition of the Board.
The Company's policy is to ensure that Directors are fairly rewarded with regard 
to responsibilities undertaken, and considers comparable pay levels in the United 
Kingdom, in Chile, and in the international mining industry. Corporate and individual 
performance is taken into account in setting the pay level for the Chairman as an 
Executive Director, and this is reviewed on an annual basis in comparison with 
companies of a similar nature, size and complexity. Remuneration levels for 
Non-Executive Directors are reviewed in comparison with companies of a similar 
nature, size and complexity, and take into account specific responsibilities undertaken.

Strategic review Operational review Financial review Governance Financial statements Other information Overview
The Committee used benchmarking data from a number of sources, but did not 
appoint external consultants to advise on Directors' remuneration during the year.
Given the predominantly non-executive composition of the Board there are 
currently no arrangements for Directors to acquire benefits through the acquisition 
of shares in the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, to benefit through 
performance-related pay or to participate in long-term incentive schemes. The UK 
Corporate Governance Code states that remuneration for Non-Executive Directors 
should not include share options or other performance-related elements. The Board 
does not consider it appropriate to make regular performance-related pay awards 
such as bonuses to the only Executive Director, Jean-Paul Luksic, given his role 
as Chairman of the Board and his interest in the Company's shares both directly 
and as a member of the Luksic family. 
No Director currently receives pension contributions, which again reflects the 
predominantly non-executive nature of the Board. The UK Corporate Governance 
Code considers that the participation by a Non-Executive Director in a company's 
pension scheme could potentially impact on the independence of that Non-
Executive Director. 
Director and Committee fees 
The following changes to the Antofagasta plc Board fees were introduced in 2011:
 - an increase of the base Non-Executive Director's fee in respect of the 
Antofagasta plc Board from US$100,000 to US$130,000 (with effect from 
1 July 2011) in order to ensure fee levels are in line with comparable 
international mining companies;
 - given the core role which Antofagasta Minerals plays in the management of the 
mining operations and projects, and that the mining division represents the large 
majority of the Group's business, all Antofagasta plc Directors also serve as 
directors of the Antofagasta Minerals board. The fees payable to directors of 
the Antofagasta Minerals board were increased with effect from 1 July 2011 
to US$130,000 for members of the board (previously US$24,000) and 
US$260,000 for the Chairman (previously US$48,000). 
 - fees were introduced for the Chairman and members of the Sustainability
 
and 
Stakeholder Management Committee, with effect from 22 August 2011.
There was no change in the fees payable to the Executive Chairman in his role 
as a Director of Antofagasta plc between 2010 and 2011.
Antofagasta plc Directors may also be appointed as directors of subsidiary 
companies and joint ventures within the Group, and they receive fees for these 
specific roles, in addition to their Antofagasta plc Board fees. These additional 
fees are included within the amounts attributable to the Directors within the table 
of Directors' remuneration below. 
The following table summarises Antofagasta plc Board Committee fees payable 
in 2011 and 2010:

Remuneration and Talent Committee chairman 16

Service contracts and letters of appointment 
Jean-Paul Luksic has a contract for services with both the Antofagasta Railway 
Company plc and Antofagasta Minerals S.A. Both contracts for services can be 
terminated by either party on one month's notice. There is also a contract between 
Antofagasta Minerals S.A. and Asesor as Ram n F Jara Ltda for the provision 
of advisory services by Ramon Jara which can also be terminated on one month's 
notice. The amounts payable under these contracts for services are denominated 
in Chilean pesos and as is typical for employment contracts or contracts for 
services in Chile, are adjusted in line with Chilean inflation, and are also reviewed 
periodically in line with the Company's policy on Directors' pay. The amounts 
payable to Ramon Jara in respect of his service contract had not been updated 
since 2006, and accordingly were reviewed during the course of the year, resulting 
in a 15% increase in these fees with effect from 1 September 2011. Amounts paid 
during 2011 and 2010 under these service contracts have been included in the 
table of Directors' remuneration. 
All Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment with the Company, for a 
period of one year, subject to re-appointment at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) 
following their appointment. As recommended by the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, all Directors are submitted for annual re-election at each AGM. These letters 
require the Non-Executive Directors to undertake that they will have sufficient time 
to discharge their responsibilities. The appointments may be terminated by either 
party on one month's notice. The letters of appointment are available for inspection 
at the Company's registered office during normal business hours and at the AGM 
(for 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting). The service contracts and letters 
of appointment do not provide for any compensation for loss of office beyond 
payments in lieu of notice, and therefore the maximum amount payable upon 
termination of these contracts is limited to one month's payment. 
No Director has a service contract with the Company which cannot be terminated 
within 12 months. Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 84

Talent management
The Remuneration and Talent Committee also reviews wider aspects of the 
Group's talent management programme, particularly in relation to senior 
management. The Committee reviews the structure of senior management 
remuneration. The structure is designed to align management compensation 
with the Group's strategic aims and shareholders' interests. Senior management 
remuneration comprises a combination of base salary and other benefits, an 
annual cash bonus and LTIP awards. The LTIP scheme was introduced at the end 
of 2011 following a review by the Committee of the level and structure of overall 
senior management compensation. Directors are not included within the scheme. 
Further details of the scheme are set out in Note 26 to the financial statements. 
The bonus and performance-related LTIP awards are based on a mixture of 
performance criteria, including Total Shareholder Return and a range of financial, 
operational and growth measures. The Committee also conducted a review 
of the Group's succession planning in respect of the senior management team 
during 2011.
During 2011 the Committee reviewed the Group's revised Talent Management 
Strategy, which is designed to attract and retain the key management and skilled 
workers required by the Group's existing operations and its growth projects. 
Further detail in respect of the Group's talent management programme is set 
out in the Sustainability report on page 52.
Performance graph 
The following graph shows the Company's performance compared to the 
performance of the FTSE All-Share Index and the HSBC Global Mining Index 
over a five-year period, measured by total shareholder return (as defined below). 
The FTSE All-Share Index has been selected as an appropriate benchmark as it 
is the most broadly based index to which the Company belongs and which relates 
to the London Stock Exchange, the market where the Company's ordinary shares 
are traded. TSR performance in comparison with the HSBC Global Mining Index 
is one of the performance criteria for the senior management LTIP scheme 
described above.
Total shareholder return is calculated to show a theoretical growth in the value of 
a shareholding over a specified period, assuming that dividends are reinvested to 
purchase additional shares at the closing price applicable on the ex-dividend date. 
Total shareholder return for the FTSE All-Share Index and the HSBC Global Mining 
Index is calculated by aggregating the returns of all individual constituents of those 
indices at the end of the five-year period.
