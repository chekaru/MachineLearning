Basis of preparation of this report  
and compliance
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008. It also meets the relevant requirements 
of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes 
how the Board has applied the principles of good governance as set 
out in the Code.
During the year under review, the Company complied with the detailed 
provisions set out in Section D of the Code except, as explained on 
page 76, the Chairman, who is the only Executive Director, did not receive 
any reward structured to vary with individual or corporate performance 
(principle D. 1 and provision D. 1. 1). 
Unaudited information
Role and responsibilities of the 
Remuneration and T alent Committee
The Remuneration and Talent Committee is responsible for setting 
remuneration policy and for reviewing the remuneration of any Executive 
Directors. The Remuneration and Talent Committee is also responsible 
for monitoring the level and structure of remuneration of Group senior 
management, reviewing succession planning for senior management, 
reviewing any major changes in compensation policies applying across 
the Group's companies that have a significant long-term impact on labour 
costs, and reviewing compensation and talent management strategies. 
The Remuneration and Talent Committee's terms of reference are 
available on the Company's website - www.antofagasta.co.uk. 
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the 
Board as a whole. No Director participates in the determination of his 
own remuneration. 
Company policy on Directors' pay 
As discussed above within the Corporate Governance Report, as at the 
date of this report the Board had ten Directors, comprising an Executive 
Chairman and nine Non-Executive Directors. The Company's approach 
to Directors' remuneration reflects this predominantly non-executive 
composition of the Board.
The Company's policy is to ensure that Directors are fairly rewarded with 
regard to responsibilities undertaken, and considers comparable pay 
levels in the United Kingdom, in Chile, and in the international mining 
industry. Corporate and individual performance is taken into account in 
setting the pay level for the Chairman as an Executive Director, and this is 
reviewed on an annual basis in comparison with companies of a similar 
nature, size and complexity. Remuneration levels for Non-Executive 
Directors are also reviewed in comparison with companies of a similar 
nature, size and complexity, and take into account specific responsibilities 
undertaken. The Remuneration and Talent Committee used benchmarking 
data from a number of sources, but did not appoint external consultants 
to advise on Directors' remuneration during the year. Pay and conditions 
for Group employees are rising in line with tight labour market conditions 
in Chile; however, the Remuneration and Talent Committee does not 
believe that this should be taken into account when determining Directors' 
remuneration, which was kept the same in 2012.

Antofagasta plc  
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012
 Strategic review Operational review Financial review Governance Financial statements  Other information Overview
Given the predominantly non-executive composition of the Board, there 
are currently no arrangements for Directors to acquire benefits through 
the acquisition of shares in the Company or any of its subsidiary 
undertakings, to benefit through performance-related pay or to participate 
in long-term incentive schemes. The Code states that remuneration for 
Non-Executive Directors should not include share options or other 
performance-related elements. The Board does not consider it 
appropriate to make regular performance-related pay awards such as 
bonuses to the only Executive Director, Jean-Paul Luksic, given his role as 
Chairman of the Board and his interest in the Company's shares (both via 
a company controlled by him and as a member of the Luksic family). 
No Director currently receives pension contributions, which again reflects 
the predominantly non-executive nature of the Board. The Code 
considers that the participation by a Non-Executive Director in a 
company's pension scheme could potentially impact on the 
independence of that Non-Executive Director. 
Directors' and Committee fees 
There has been no change to the level of Antofagasta plc Board fees 
in 2012:
 - the base Non-Executive Director's fee in respect of the Antofagasta plc 
Board remains at US$130,000;
 - given the core role which Antofagasta Minerals plays in the 
management of the mining operations and projects, and that the 
mining division represents the large majority of the Group's business, 
all Antofagasta plc Directors also serve as directors of the Antofagasta 
Minerals board. The fees payable to directors of Antofagasta Minerals 
remain at US$130,000 for members of the Board and US$260,000 
for the Chairman. Therefore, the combined base fees payable to 
Non-Executive Directors of both Antofagasta plc and Antofagasta 
Minerals amount to US$260,000 per annum. 
The overall fees payable to the Board in 2012 are higher than in 201 1. 
This is primarily explained by the full-year impact of the new Antofagasta 
plc and Antofagasta Minerals Board fees which were revised with effect 
from 1 July 201 1, and the full-year impact of the increase in Antofagasta 
Minerals' contract fees with effect from 1 September 201 1 for Ram n 
Jara. This is further explained by the impact of new Board appointments 
during 201 1 and 2012 which effectively resulted in the Board having an 
additional board member throughout 2012 and, to a lesser extent, the 
exchange rate impact of Chilean peso-denominated fees. 
There was no change in the fees payable to the Executive Chairman  
in his role as a Director of Antofagasta plc between 201 1 and 2012.
Antofagasta plc Directors may also be appointed as directors of 
subsidiary companies and joint venture companies within the Group, 
and they receive fees for these specific roles, in addition to their 
Antofagasta plc Board fees. These additional fees are included within 
the amounts attributable to the Directors within the table of Directors' 
remuneration that follows.

Service contracts and letters of appointment 
During 2012, Jean-Paul Luksic had a contract for services with both the 
Antofagasta Railway Company plc dated 1 April 2008 and Antofagasta 
Minerals S.A. dated 2 November 2004. Neither contract has an expiry 
date, but each of them can be terminated by either party on one month's 
notice. There is also a contract between Antofagasta Minerals S.A. and 
Asesor as Ram n F Jara Ltda (formerly E.I.R.L.) dated 2 November 2004 
for the provision of advisory services by Ram n Jara which also does not 
have an expiry date but can be terminated by either party on one month's 
notice. The amounts payable under these contracts for services are 
denominated in Chilean pesos and, as is typical for employment contracts 
or contracts for services in Chile, are adjusted in line with Chilean inflation, 
and are also reviewed periodically in line with the Company's policy on 
Directors' pay. Amounts paid during 2012 and 201 1 under these contracts 
for services have been included in the table of Directors' remuneration. 
As recommended by the Code, all Directors are submitted for annual 
re-election at each AGM. Each Non-Executive Director has a letter of 
appointment with the Company for an initial period of one year from the 
date of his appointment, subject to re-appointment at the Annual General 
Meeting following their appointment. These letters, which are renewed 
on their re-appointment at each AGM, require the Non-Executive 
Directors to undertake that they will have sufficient time to discharge their 
responsibilities. The appointments may be terminated by either party on 
one month's notice. The letters of appointment are available for inspection 
at the Company's registered office during normal business hours and at 
the AGM (for 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting). 
The contracts for services and letters of appointment do not provide for 
any compensation for loss of office beyond payments in lieu of notice, 
and therefore the maximum amount payable upon termination of these 
contracts is limited to one month's payment. 
No Director has a service contract with the Company which cannot 
be terminated within 12 months.
Directors' interests 
The Directors who held office at 31 December 2012 had the following 
interests in the ordinary shares of the Company:

the Company or its subsidiary undertakings during the year other than 
in the ordinary course of business.

T alent management
The Remuneration and Talent Committee also reviews wider aspects of 
the Group's talent management programme, particularly in relation to 
senior management. The Remuneration and Talent Committee reviews 
the structure of senior management remuneration. The structure is 
designed to align management compensation with the Group's strategic 
aims and shareholders' interests. Senior management remuneration 
comprises a combination of base salary and other benefits, an annual 
cash bonus and conditional cash awards based on the price of ordinary 
shares of the Company granted pursuant to the Long Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP ). Directors are not eligible to participate in the LTIP , which reflects 
the predominantly non-executive nature of the Board. Under the terms of 
the LTIP , the Group may grant awards based on the price of ordinary 
shares of the Company and cannot grant awards over actual shares. 
Two types of awards may be granted pursuant to the LTIP:
 - Restricted Awards: These awards are conditional rights to receive cash 
payment by reference to a specified number of the Company's ordinary 
shares subject to the relevant employee remaining employed by the 
Group when the Restricted Award vests; and
 - Performance Awards: These awards are conditional rights to receive 
cash payment by reference to a specified number of the Company's 
ordinary shares subject to both the satisfaction of a performance 
condition and the relevant employee remaining employed by the Group 
when the Performance Award vests. The performance criteria reflect 
a number of factors including total shareholder return (as discussed 
further below), earnings levels, growth in the Group's reserves and 
resources and project delivery targets.
Further details of the LTIP are set out in Note 26 to the financial 
statements.
Diego Hern ndez has been granted awards under the LTIP and has also 
been granted an exceptional, long-term award (One-off Award ). The 
One-off Award was granted to Diego Hern ndez for the same purpose as 
the awards granted under the LTIP but by reference to metrics which are 
specific to his role as Chief Executive Officer of Antofagasta Minerals. 
Awards granted under the One-off Award are conditional rights to receive 
a cash payment by reference to the market value of a number of ordinary 
shares at vesting. The One-off Award was not granted over actual shares 
and Directors are not eligible to receive a One-off Award. Vesting of the 
One-off Award will be as follows:
 - Half of the One-off Award is subject both to certain performance 
conditions which are measured over a three-year period (ending on 
1 August 2015, the three-year anniversary of the effective date of 
Diego Hern ndez's appointment) and to continued employment.  
That half of the award will normally vest only after the end of the 
three-year performance period and only to the extent that those 
performance conditions are met.
 - The other half of the One-off Award is subject to continued employment 
and will normally vest on 1 August 2015. 
The Remuneration and Talent Committee also conducted a review of the 
Group's succession planning in respect of the senior management team 
during 2012.
During 2012 the Remuneration and Talent Committee reviewed the 
Group's Talent Management Strategy, which is designed to attract and 
retain the key management and skilled workers required by the Group's 
existing operations and its growth projects. Further detail in respect of the 
Group's talent management programme is set out in the Sustainability 
Report on page 57 .
Performance graph 
The following graph shows the Company's performance compared to the 
performance of the FTSE All-Share Index and the HSBC Global Mining 
Index over a five-year period, measured by total shareholder return (as 
defined below). The FTSE All-Share Index has been selected as an 
appropriate benchmark as it is the most broadly-based index to which 
the Company belongs and which relates to the London Stock Exchange, 
the market where the Company's ordinary shares are traded. Total 
shareholder return performance in comparison with the HSBC Global 
Mining Index is one of the performance criteria for Performance Awards 
granted pursuant to the LTIP as described above.
Total shareholder return is calculated to show a theoretical growth in the 
value of a shareholding over a specified period, assuming that dividends 
are reinvested to purchase additional shares at the closing price 
applicable on the ex-dividend date. Total shareholder return for the 
FTSE All-Share Index and the HSBC Global Mining Index is calculated 
by aggregating the returns of all individual constituents of those indices at 
the end of the five-year period.
