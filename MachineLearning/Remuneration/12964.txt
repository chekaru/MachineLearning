 Report of the
Remuneration
Committee
16
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and
Reports) Regulations 2008, which introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of Directors' remuneration in respect of
periods commencing on or after 6 April 2008. The report also meets the relevant requirements of the AIM Rules and describes how
the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors' remuneration. In accordance with best practice,
notwithstanding that these regulations do not strictly apply to AIM companies, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at
the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the non-Executive Directors as follows:
Dr S Rollason (Chairman)
E McDaid
J Pither
G Wright
As appropriate, the Committee may invite the Chief Executive to participate in some of its discussions. No Director plays a part in any
discussion about his own remuneration.
The Committee is responsible for determining the terms and conditions of employment of Executive Directors. It is also responsible
for considering management recommendations for remuneration and employment terms of the Group's staff, including incentive
arrangements for bonus payments and grants of share options.
The constitution and operation of the Committee is in compliance with the provisions of the Combined Code 2008 on Corporate
Governance. When setting its remuneration policy the Committee gives full consideration to the provisions and principles of the
Combined Code. In setting the policy it considers a number of factors including:
_ The basic salaries and benefits available to executive Directors and senior management of comparable companies.
_ The need to attract and retain Directors and senior management of an appropriate calibre.
_ The need to ensure Executive Directors' and senior management's commitment to the future success of the Group by 
means of incentive schemes.
Remuneration of non-Executive Directors 
The remuneration of the non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board with reference to the annual survey of independent
Directors carried out by Independent Remuneration Solutions.
The non-Executive Directors do not receive any pension or other benefits from the Company, nor do they participate in any of the
bonus schemes.
The non-Executive Directors have service agreements, which are reviewed by the Board annually, and they are also included in the
one third of Directors subject to retirement by rotation at each Annual General Meeting. 17

Remuneration of Executive Director
The Executive Director has a service contract, which can be terminated on one year's notice by either party. The Remuneration
Committee will review each case of early termination individually in order to ensure compensation settlements are made which are
appropriate to the circumstances, taking care to ensure that poor performance is not rewarded.  The most recent executed contract
for the Executive Director was for F Maguire on 6 December 2002.  The Company's remuneration policy for Executive Directors is
to:
_         Have regard to the individual's experience and the nature and complexity of their work in order to pay a competitive 
           salary that attracts and retains management of the highest quality.
_         Link individual remuneration packages to the Group's long term performance through the award of share options and 
           bonus schemes.
_         Provide post retirement benefits through defined contribution pension schemes.
_         Provide employment related benefits including the provision of a company car, life assurance, medical insurance and 
           insurance relating to the individual's duties. 
Salaries and Benefits
The Remuneration Committee meets twice each year to consider and set the annual salaries and benefits for the Executive Director,
having regard to personal performance and independent advice concerning comparable organisations.
Performance Related Bonuses
An annual performance related bonus scheme is operated by the Group. Under the scheme bonuses are payable to Executive Directors
subject to terms laid down by the Remuneration Committee from time to time. 
Share Options
The Company operates an Approved Share Option Scheme and an Unapproved Share Option Scheme.
Only Executive Directors and employees of the Group resident in the UK are eligible to participate in the Share Option Scheme,
which has been approved by HM Revenue and Customs under the provisions of Schedule 9 to the Income and Corporation Taxes
Act 1988.
Any person who at the date of grant is approved by the Board is entitled to participate in the Unapproved Share Option Scheme.
The award of options under both schemes is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The options issued to date under both schemes will only be exercisable if the average mid market closing price of the Company's
shares on the five business days prior to the date of exercise exceeds the option price by 15% or more and after the elapse of three
years from the date of grant of the option.
Pensions
The Group made contributions to a personal pension plan for F Maguire at the rate of 10% of pensionable salary.
