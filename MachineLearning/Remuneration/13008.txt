Remuneration policy
Remuneration
In order to safeguard the interests of the Group, the Committee aims to provide Executive Directors and employees of the Group 
with a remuneration package set to attract, retain and motivate Directors and employees of the appropriate calibre. Bonus 
schemes are determined for each financial year, based on the Group's financial performance, targets for which are approved  
by the Remuneration Committee.
Share options
The APC Technology Group PLC Company Share Option Plan was established on 7 October 1996 for the benefit of all 
employees of the Group employed at that date as well as certain of the Directors. On 17 June 2003 the Board approved the 
establishment of a new plan, the 2003 Employee Share Option Scheme, which superseded the 1996 plan. On 6 September 
2013 the Board approved the establishment of a new plan, the 2013 Employee Share Option Scheme, which superseded the 
2003 plan.
The 2003 and 2013 Employee Share Option Schemes require that certain performance conditions must be satisfied before 
options may be exercised. The performance conditions are based on achievement of budgeted profit before taxation.
Details of the share options granted to directors and outstanding as at 31 August 2013 are listed below:
