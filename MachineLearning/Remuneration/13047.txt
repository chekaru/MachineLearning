DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
INTRODUCTION
The following Report outlines the Company's policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors and gives details of
the remuneration packages of Executive Directors and of the fees paid to Non-executive Directors for the year ended
30 September 2003. The Report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the
Companies Act 1985 which apply for the first time to the Company. Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985
requires designated parts of the Remuneration Report to be audited, whilst other parts are not. Pages 32 to 34 and the
tables thereon comprise the auditable part  of the Remuneration Report. In addition, in preparing this Report,
consideration has been given to the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and Schedule B to the Combined Code
(as it applied to the Company for the year ended 30 September 2003). This Report has been approved by both the
Remuneration Committee and by the Board and it is the intention of the Board to put this Report to an advisory vote
of Shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE (COMMITTEE ) AND ADVISERS
In accordance with the Combined Code, the members of the Committee are all independent of management and free
from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent
judgment. 
During the year, the Committee comprised David Hudd, Richard Wright and Andrew Walker (with effect from his
appointment to the Committee on 25 July 2003) and John Sheldrick (up to the date of his retirement from the Board
and the Committee on 31 January 2003) and, throughout the period, the Committee was chaired by David Hudd.
Although not a member of the Committee, on occasions and for matters not related to him, the Committee would
normally consult the Group Chief Executive on proposals relating to the remuneration of the other Executive Director
and members of the Group's senior management team, and he attends meetings of the Committee by invitation.
The Committee, on behalf of the Board, determines all elements of the remuneration packages of the Executive
Directors and certain senior executives of the Group. It approves the terms of service contracts with Executive
Directors and would also approve any compensation arrangements resulting from the termination by the Company of
a Director's service contract. The Committee also approves the grant of share options. The terms of reference of the
Remuneration Committee include the following:
  to make recommendations to the Board on the Company's framework of executive remuneration and its cost;
  to review and determine, on behalf of the Board, the remuneration and incentive packages of the Company's
Executive Directors and certain senior executives of the Group to ensure that they are fairly rewarded for their
individual contributions to the Company's overall performance;
 to assist the Board in preparing a report to Shareholders in relation to remuneration;
 to determine the basis on which the employment of the Company's Executive Directors and certain senior
executives of the Group is terminated; and
 to operate and administer the Company's share option schemes and employee benefit trust.
During the year, the Committee took advice from Watson Wyatt LLP on pensions aspects of the remuneration
packages of the Executive Directors. Watson Wyatt advise the Company on the Group's pension and life assurance
scheme and on pension arrangements generally for the Group's employees.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of Non-executive Directors, other than the Chairman, is reviewed and determined by the other
members of the Board. The Remuneration of the Chairman is reviewed and determined on behalf of the Board by the
other Non-executive Directors.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Committee and the Board recognise that, in order to attract and retain a senior management team which will
secure maximum shareholder value in a competitive international environment, it is necessary to operate a competitive
pay and benefits structure. In reviewing the basic salary of the Executive Directors in October each year, the
Committee takes into account the general performance and contribution of the individual and also the Group's financial
results for the immediately preceding financial year. The Committee also links the annual bonus awards of each
Executive Director to the individual performance of the Executive Director against specific objectives agreed with the 31 API Group plc
Committee and the financial performance of the Group. In addition, the Committee encourages each Executive
Director to build an appropriate shareholding in the Company through the operation of the Group's share option
schemes described below. Accordingly, there are significant elements of the remuneration packages which are wholly
or partly linked to the performance of the individual or the financial performance of the Company. The Committee
therefore believes that these arrangements align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of Shareholders.
CURRENT AND FUTURE POLICY 
It is the policy of the Committee and the Board to maintain the above approach to remuneration packages for Executive
Directors and other senior executives of the Group for the current financial year and future financial years, subject to
review in the light of any changes in relevant legislation, regulations or market practice. Accordingly, no significant
changes to the remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors are currently anticipated. However, the Committee
will continue to review base salaries and performance targets to ensure that they align with the policy of the Committee
and the Board and with the Company's strategic objectives from time to time.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION PACKAGES
The components of the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors are as follows:
Basic Salary - fixed by the Committee taking into account, from time to time, advice of independent consultants
regarding the market level for jobs with similar responsibilities in an appropriate comparator group. Basic salary is
normally reviewed as at 1 October each year and takes account of individual performance during the preceding year
and the financial performance of the Group.
Annual Bonus - payable of up to 50% of basic salary; the amount of the bonus payable each year normally depends
upon the achievement by the individual of performance targets and by the Company of financial targets for the
relevant financial year, in each case as agreed by the Committee. The performance targets for bonus entitlements are
intended by the Committee to create keen incentives to perform at the highest levels. 
Share Options - under the Company's executive share option schemes, Executive Directors and senior executives are
eligible for the grant of options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company. Options are granted at an exercise price
not less than market value at the date of grant and may normally only be exercised if performance targets set at the
time of grant have been achieved. The right to exercise all outstanding options is subject to achievement of total
shareholder return (TSR) of at least 12.5% over three years from the date of grant. TSR is measured based on an
opening value equal to the exercise price and a closing value of the average of the middle market quotations of an
ordinary share in the Company for each of the business days in the last 30 days in the three year period. If TSR is
exactly 12.5%, only half the shares under option may be acquired. All the shares may be acquired if TSR is at least
25%. Where TSR is between 12.5% and 25%, a rising proportion of the shares, calculated on a straight line basis, may
be acquired. The Committee does not consider that comparative performance targets are appropriate, given the
specialised nature of the Company's business, and considers that targets related to absolute TSR most appropriately
align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of Shareholders. The Committee currently intends to apply
the same targets to future grants of options.
Details of options granted to Executive Directors which are outstanding and details of the Group's share option
schemes are given on page 34.
Pensions and Life Assurance - Executive Directors participate in a contributory final salary pension scheme which is
Inland Revenue approved. The scheme provides, at normal retirement age and subject to length of service, a pension
of up to two thirds of pensionable salary at retirement subject to a minimum of 30 years' service with the Group and
subject to Inland Revenue limits and other statutory rules. Pension entitlement is calculated by reference to basic salary
only (subject to the earnings cap for pension purposes) and neither annual bonuses nor benefits in kind are pensionable.
Details of the pension benefits which accrued during the year to the Executive Directors under the scheme are set out
below in a separate table. Service as a Non-executive Director is not pensionable. Life assurance cover is provided
based on four times the capped salary. In addition to basic salary, a supplementary payment is made to Executive
Directors in order to allow the Executive Directors to make their own additional pension provision. In 2002, this
supplementary payment had been 18% for both Derek Ashley and David Walton - in each case of the difference
between the earnings cap for pensions and the basic salary. However, following recent advice from the Company's
pension consultants, this percentage has been increased in each case to more accurately and fairly reflect the cost of
funding pension arrangements in relation to their respective pensions earnings above the earnings cap. In the case of
Derek Ashley, the percentage was increased to 25% and in the case of David Walton to 33%. Those increases were
applied with retrospective effect for the financial year ended 30 September 2002 and also applied for the year ended 32 API Group plc
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
30 September 2003. The Committee currently expects that those percentages would continue to apply in the future in
the absence of any material change to pensions legislation. These payments are shown in the table below under
Payment Above Pension Cap  and the payments to Derek Ashley and David Walton to give effect to the increase in
the rate of supplementary payments relating to the pensions earnings cap (including the payment attributed
retrospectively to 2002) are included in the figures under Payment Above Pension Cap  in the table for the year ended
30 September 2003. 
Other benefits - afforded to the Executive Directors include private health care insurance, permanent health insurance
(to secure income in the event of ill health or disability) and a company car or equivalent monetary value. The value
of the taxable benefits of the Executive Directors for the year ended 30 September 2003 are shown in the table on page
33 under Taxable Benefits .
SERVICE CONTRACTS AND TERMINATION
Derek Ashley's service contract with the Company is dated 18 December 2000 and came into effect on 15 January
2001. David Walton's service contract with the Company is dated 30 November 2001 and came into effect on 3
December 2001.
The Company may terminate the service contracts of Derek Ashley and David Walton by giving not less than twelve
months' notice. Any compensation payable by the Company would be subject to the normal legal principles of
mitigation of loss. No compensation would be payable if the service contracts were to be terminated by notice from
Derek Ashley or David Walton, or for lawful early termination by the Company. There are no provisions for payment
of pre-determined compensation under the service contracts save on a change of control or takeover of the company.
In those circumstances, Derek Ashley and David Walton may both terminate their service contracts by notice given
within 12 months from the date of the change of control or takeover and, on termination, would be entitled to receive
a lump sum payment equivalent to 12 months' salary and the cost to the Company of providing for 12 months the other
benefits and emoluments under their service contracts.
In concluding the service contracts for Derek Ashley and David Walton, the Committee had due regard to the
provisions of the Combined Code referring to the notice periods for service contracts. 
In relation to future appointments of Executive Directors, the Committee's and Board's policy will be to restrict notice
periods for terminating service contracts to one year - although the Committee and the Board may, in appropriate
circumstances, offer longer initial notice periods which would reduce to one year.
David Hudd is the Director retiring by rotation at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and, being eligible, offers
himself for re-election in accordance with the Company's Articles of Association. David Hudd does not have a service
contract with the Company.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' LETTERS OF ENGAGEMENT
The Company's practice is to appoint Non-executive Directors under letters of engagement rather than under service
contracts. Those letters of engagement set out fixed terms of appointment (normally 3 years) which may be extended
with the agreement of the Board. David Hudd currently serves the Company as Non-executive Chairman. He was
appointed under a letter of engagement dated 2 July 1998 which expired on 1 July 2001 and his appointment was
extended for a further three years from that date under a further letter of engagement. Richard Wright was appointed
to the Board under a letter of engagement dated 3 September 2001 for a term of three years which will expire on 2
September 2004. Andrew Walker was appointed to the Board under a letter of engagement dated 25 July 2003 for a
term of three years which will expire on 24 July 2006.
PERFORMANCE GRAPH
The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (now Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985) require listed
companies to provide, by graph, an analysis of the performance of the Company (being total shareholder return) over
time as compared with an appropriate and broad equity market index. The graph below shows the total shareholder
return (with dividends reinvested) in terms of the change in value over the last five financial years (beginning on 3
October 1998 and ending on 30 September 2003) of an initial investment in the Company's shares against a
corresponding investment in a hypothetical holding of shares in the companies represented in FTSE All Share index.
The FTSE All Share index has been selected because it is a very broad equity market index which includes the
Company's shares and the Committee believes that no other index would provide a more appropriate comparator,
given the specialist nature of the Group's activities. 140

Notes:
1. Granted under the terms of a deed dated 5 June 2001. No price was payable for the grant of the option. The right to exercise this
option was conditional upon the achievement of targets related to the adjusted earnings per share of the Company for the financial
year ended 30 September 2003. These targets were not met and, consequently, the option lapsed on 9 December 2003 before it
would otherwise have become exercisable.
2. Granted under the Company's approved share option plan 2002 (Approved Plan). No price is payable for the grant of an option.
3. Granted under the Company's unapproved share option plan 2002 (Unapproved Plan). No price is payable for the grant of an option.
4. The right to exercise all options granted to an individual on the same day (whether under the Approved Plan or the Unapproved
Plan) is subject to achievement of total shareholder return (TSR) of at least 12.5% over three years from the date of grant. TSR is
measured based on an opening value equal to the exercise price and a closing value of the average of the middle market quotations
of an ordinary share in the Company for each of the business days in the last 30 days in the three year period. If TSR is exactly
12.5%, only half the total number of shares under option may be acquired. All the shares may be acquired if TSR is at least 25%.
Where TSR is between 12.5% and 25%, a rising proportion of the shares, calculated on a straight line basis, may be acquired.
5. In relation to these options granted on the same day, if TSR over the three years from the date of grant is at least 12.5%, the
optionholder may acquire all the shares under option under the Approved Plan but may only exercise the option granted under
the Unapproved Plan to acquire the balance of the shares in respect of which the options have become exercisable in accordance
with the performance condition.
The mid-market price of the Company's shares at 30 September 2003 was 90 pence and the range during 2002/2003
was 55.5 pence to 90.5 pence.
The interests of the Directors and their immediate families in the shares of the Company (including share options as
above) according to the register required to be kept pursuant to the Companies Act 1985 were as shown below:

Save as mentioned above, from 30 September 2003 to 9 December 2003 there were no changes in the above interests.
All the above interests were beneficial at the above dates. Derek Ashley and David Walton were, at 1 October 2002,
at 30 September 2003 and at 9 December 2003, deemed to be interested as discretionary beneficiaries of the
Company's No.2 Employee Benefit Trust in all the 588,000 ordinary shares in the Company held by that trust on those
dates. Save as mentioned above, no Director had any interest in any share capital of the Company or of any subsidiary.
