DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
INTRODUCTION
The following Report outlines the Company's policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors and gives details of
the remuneration packages of Executive Directors and of the fees paid to Non-executive Directors for the year ended
30 September 2004. The Report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the
Companies Act 1985. Part 3 of Schedule 7A requires designated parts of the Remuneration Report to be audited, whilst
other parts are not. Pages 30 to 32 and the tables thereon comprise the auditable part  of the Remuneration Report.
In addition, in preparing this Report, consideration has been given to the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority
and to the Combined Code. This Report has been approved by both the Remuneration Committee and by the Board
and it is the intention of the Board to put this Report to an advisory vote of Shareholders at the forthcoming Annual
General Meeting.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE (COMMITTEE ) AND ADVISERS
In accordance with the Combined Code, the members of the Committee are all independent of management and free
from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent
judgement.
During the year, the Committee comprised Richard Wright, Andrew Walker and David Hudd (up to the date of his
resignation from the Committee on 8 September 2004). Prior to 8 September 2004, the Committee was chaired by Mr
Hudd. Since that date, it has been chaired by Mr Wright. Although no longer a member of the Committee, the
Committee continues to consult Mr Hudd on issues not related to him where his experience and knowledge are of
benefit to the Committee's deliberations and he attends meetings of the Committee by invitation. Although not a
member of the Committee, on occasions and for matters not related to him, the Committee also consults the Group
Chief Executive on proposals relating to the remuneration of the other Executive Director and members of the Group's
senior management team, and he also attends meetings of the Committee by invitation.
The Committee, on behalf of the Board, determines all elements of the remuneration packages of the Executive
Directors and certain senior executives of the Group. It approves the terms of service contracts with Executive
Directors and also approves any compensation arrangements resulting from the termination by the Company of a
Director's service contract. The Committee also approves the grant of share options. The terms of reference of the
Committee include the following:
  to make recommendations to the Board on the Company's framework of executive remuneration and its cost;
  to review and determine, on behalf of the Board, the remuneration and incentive packages of the Company's
Executive Directors and certain senior executives of the Group to ensure that they are fairly rewarded for their
individual contributions to the Company's overall performance;
 to assist the Board in preparing a report to Shareholders in relation to remuneration;
 to determine the basis on which the employment of the Company's Executive Directors and certain senior
executives of the Group is terminated; and
 to operate and administer the Company's share option schemes and employee benefit trust.
During the year, the Committee took advice from Watson Wyatt LLP on pensions aspects of the remuneration
packages of the Executive Directors. The Committee also took advice from Addleshaw Goddard, its principal UK
solicitors, in respect of matters arising under the Company's share option schemes and also regarding the termination
of the service contract of Derek Ashley and the extent of the company's obligations arising from that termination. 
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of Non-executive Directors, other than the Chairman, is reviewed and determined by the other
members of the Board. The remuneration of the Chairman is reviewed and determined on behalf of the Board by the
Committee.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Committee and the Board recognise that, in order to attract and retain a senior management team which will
secure maximum shareholder value in a competitive international environment, it is necessary to operate a competitive
pay and benefits structure. In conducting an annual review of the remuneration of the Executive Directors, the
Committee takes into account the general performance and contribution of the individual and also the Group's financial 28 API Group plc
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
results for the immediately preceding financial year. The Committee also links the annual bonus awards of each
Executive Director to the individual performance of the Executive Director against specific objectives agreed with the
Committee and the financial performance of the Group. In addition, the Committee encourages each Executive
Director to build an appropriate shareholding in the Company through the operation of the Group's share option
schemes described below. Accordingly, there are significant elements of the remuneration packages which are wholly
or partly linked to the performance of the individual or the financial performance of the Company. The Committee
therefore believes that these arrangements align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of Shareholders.
CURRENT AND FUTURE POLICY 
It is the policy of the Committee and the Board to maintain the above approach to remuneration packages for Executive
Directors and other senior executives of the Group for the current financial year and future financial years, subject to
review in the light of any changes in relevant legislation, regulations or market practice. Accordingly, no significant
changes to the remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors are currently anticipated. However, the Committee
will continue to review base salaries and performance targets to ensure that they align with the policy of the Committee
and the Board and with the Company's strategic objectives from time to time.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION PACKAGES
The components of the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors are as follows:
Basic Salary - fixed by the Committee taking into account, from time to time, advice of independent consultants
regarding the market level for jobs with similar responsibilities in an appropriate comparator group. Basic salary is
normally reviewed as at 1 January each year and takes account of individual performance during the preceding financial
year and the financial performance of the Group. 
Annual Bonus - payable of up to 50% of basic salary; the amount of the bonus payable each year normally depends
upon the achievement by the individual of performance targets and by the Company of financial targets for the
relevant financial year, in each case as agreed by the Committee. The performance targets for bonus entitlements are
intended by the Committee to create keen incentives to perform at the highest levels.
Share Options - under the Company's executive share option schemes, Executive Directors and senior executives are
eligible for the grant of options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company. Options are granted at an exercise price
not less than market value at the date of grant and may normally only be exercised if performance targets set at the
time of grant have been achieved. The right to exercise all outstanding options is subject to achievement of annual
total shareholder return (TSR) of at least 12.5% over three years from the date of grant. TSR is measured based on an
opening value equal to the exercise price and a closing value of the average of the middle market quotations of an
ordinary share in the Company for each of the business days in the last 30 days in the three year period. If TSR is
exactly 12.5%, only half the shares under option may be acquired. All the shares may be acquired if TSR is at least
25%. Where TSR is between 12.5% and 25%, a rising proportion of the shares, calculated on a straight line basis, may
be acquired. The Committee does not consider that comparative performance targets are appropriate, given the
specialised nature of the Company's business, and considers that targets related to absolute TSR most appropriately
align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of Shareholders. The Committee currently intends to apply
the same targets to future grants of options.
Details of options granted to Executive Directors which are outstanding and details of the Group's share option
schemes are given on page 31.
Pensions and Life Assurance - Executive Directors participate in a contributory final salary pension scheme which is
Inland Revenue approved. The scheme provides, at normal retirement age and subject to length of service, a pension
of up to two thirds of pensionable salary at retirement subject to a minimum of 30 years' service with the Group and
subject to Inland Revenue limits and other statutory rules. Pension entitlement is calculated by reference to basic salary
only (subject to the earnings cap for pension purposes) and neither annual bonuses nor benefits in kind are pensionable.
Details of the pension benefits which accrued during the year to the Executive Directors under the scheme are set out
below in a separate table. Service as a Non-executive Director is not pensionable. Life assurance cover is provided
based on four times the capped salary. In addition to basic salary, a supplementary payment is made to Executive
Directors in order to allow the Executive Directors to make their own additional pension provision. In 2004, this
supplementary payment has been 33% for David Walton and 25% for Colin Ames - in each case of the difference
between the earnings cap for pensions and the basic salary. The Committee currently expects that those percentages
would continue to apply in the future in the absence of any material change to pensions legislation. These payments
to Mr Walton and Mr Ames are shown in the table below under Payment Above Pension Cap .  29 API Group plc
Other benefits - afforded to the Executive Directors include private health care insurance, permanent health insurance
(to secure income in the event of ill health or disability) and a company car or equivalent monetary value. The value
of the taxable benefits of the Executive Directors for the year ended 30 September 2004 are shown in the table on page
30 under Taxable Benefits .
SERVICE CONTRACTS AND TERMINATION
David Walton's service contract with the Company is dated 30 November 2001 and came into effect on 3 December
2001. Colin Ames' service contract with the Company is dated and came into effect on 18 November 2004.
The Company may terminate the service contracts of Mr Walton and Mr Ames by giving not less than twelve months'
notice. Any compensation payable by the Company would be subject to the normal legal principles of mitigation of
loss. No compensation would be payable if the service contracts were to be terminated by notice from Mr Walton or
Mr Ames, or for lawful early termination by the Company. There are no provisions for payment of pre-determined
compensation under the service contracts save, in respect of Mr Walton's service contract, on a change of control or
takeover of the company. In those circumstances, Mr Walton may terminate his service contract by notice given within
12 months from the date of the change of control or takeover and, on termination, would be entitled to receive a lump
sum payment equivalent to 12 months' salary and the cost to the Company of providing for 12 months the other
benefits and emoluments under his service contract.
In concluding the service contracts for Mr Walton and Mr Ames, the Committee had due regard to the provisions of
the Combined Code referring to the notice periods for service contracts.
In relation to future appointments of Executive Directors, the Committee's and Board's policy will remain one of
restricting notice periods for terminating service contracts to one year - although the Committee and the Board may,
in appropriate circumstances, offer longer initial notice periods which would reduce to one year.
Mr Walton and Richard Wright are the Directors retiring at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and each is offering
himself for re-election. Mr Ames was appointed to the Board following the 2004 Annual General Meeting. Under the
provisions of the Company's Articles of Association, he will retire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and,
being eligible, will offer himself for re-election at that meeting. The service contracts of Mr Walton and Mr Ames do
not have a fixed duration or termination date. The minimum unexpired term of their service contracts on any given
date is, accordingly, its notice period as set out above. Mr Wright does not have a service contract with the Company.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' LETTERS OF ENGAGEMENT
The Company's practice is to appoint Non-executive Directors under letters of engagement rather than under service
contracts. Those letters of engagement set out fixed terms of appointment (normally 3 years) which may be extended
with the agreement of the Board. David Hudd currently serves the Company as Non-executive Chairman. He was
appointed under a letter of engagement dated 2 July 1998 and, following its expiry, his appointment was renewed for
further successive periods of three years on 2 July 2001 and 2 July 2004 respectively under further letters of
engagement. Richard Wright was appointed to the Board under a letter of engagement dated 3 September 2001 which
expired on 2 September 2004 and his appointment was extended for a further three years from 3 September 2004 under
a further letter of engagement. Andrew Walker was appointed to the Board under a letter of engagement dated 25 July
2003 for a term of three years which will expire on 24 July 2006.
PERFORMANCE GRAPH
Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 requires listed companies to provide, by graph, an analysis of the performance
of the Company (being total shareholder return) over time as compared with an appropriate and broad equity market
index. The graph below shows the total shareholder return (with dividends reinvested) in terms of the change in value
over the last five financial years (beginning on 1 October 1999 and ending on 30 September 2004) of an initial
investment in the Company's shares against a corresponding investment in a hypothetical holding of shares in the
companies represented in FTSE All Share index. The FTSE All Share index has been selected because it is a very broad
equity market index which includes the Company's shares and the Committee believes that no other index would
provide a more appropriate comparator, given the specialist nature of the Group's activities. 30 API Group plc

Notes:
(i) In addition, supplementary payments are made by the Company to David Walton and Colin Ames being,
respectively, 33% and 25% of the difference between the earning's cap for pensions purposes and basic salary - to
enable them to make their own additional pension provision. Supplementary payments were also made by the
Company to Derek Ashley during the period when he was a Director being 25% of the difference between the
earning's cap for pension purposes and basic salary.
(ii)Following the departure of Derek Ashley, Colin Ames became a Director on 27 May 2004. He was already a
member of the Fund and had accrued a pension prior to being made a Director.
(iii)Mr Ashley left the Company and became a deferred member of the Fund on 26 May 2004. His annual pension at
date of leaving was  7,208. As Mr Ashley was not a Director for the full year, the change in accrued benefit over
the year is based on pension at date of leaving and includes the effect of inflation (rather than being net of
inflation). The transfer value of the change in accrued benefit has been calculated as at his date of leaving.
(iv) The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 published by the
Institute of Actuaries and Faculty of Actuaries.

Notes:
1. Granted under the terms of a deed dated 5 June 2001. No price was payable for the grant of the option. The right
to exercise this option was conditional upon the achievement of targets related to the adjusted earnings per share 32 API Group plc
of the Company for the financial year ended 30 September 2003. These targets were not met and, consequently,
the option lapsed on 9 December 2003 before it would otherwise have become exercisable.
2. Granted under the Company's approved share option plan 2002 (Approved Plan). No price is payable for the grant
of an option.
3. Granted under the Company's unapproved share option plan 2002 (Unapproved Plan). No price is payable for the
grant of an option.
4. The right to exercise all options granted to an individual on the same day (whether under the Approved Plan or the
Unapproved Plan) is subject to achievement of total shareholder return (TSR) of at least 12.5% over a three year
performance period from the date of grant. TSR is measured based on an opening value equal to the exercise price
and a closing value of the average of the middle market quotations of an ordinary share in the Company for each
of the business days in the last 30 days in the three year period. If TSR is exactly 12.5%, only half the total number
of shares under option may be acquired. All the shares may be acquired if TSR is at least 25%. Where TSR is
between 12.5% and 25%, a rising proportion of the shares, calculated on a straight line basis, may be acquired. The
share prices shown in the table for 12.5% TSR and 25% TSR are indicative only as they assume no dividends are
paid by the Company. Any dividend paid by the Company during the performance period will affect the TSR
calculation.
5. In relation to these options granted on the same day, if TSR over the three years from the date of grant is at least
12.5%, the option holder may acquire all the shares under option under the Approved Plan but may only exercise
the option granted under the Unapproved Plan to acquire the balance of the shares in respect of which the options
have become exercisable in accordance with the performance condition.
6. The Board has exercised its discretion to allow Derek Ashley to retain the benefit of these options, subject always
to the attainment of the applicable performance conditions, until 25 May 2005 being the period of twelve months
following the termination of his employment.
The mid-market price of the Company's shares at 30 September 2004 was 74.5 pence and the range during 2003/2004
was 54.5 pence to 88.5 pence.
The interests of the Directors and their immediate families in the shares of the Company (including share options as
above) according to the register required to be kept pursuant to the Companies Act 1985 were as shown below:

From 30 September 2004 to 23 November 2004 there were no changes in the above interests. All the above interests
were beneficial at the above dates. David Walton and Colin Ames were, at 1 October 2003, at 30 September 2004 and
at 23 November 2004, deemed to be interested as discretionary beneficiaries of the Company's No. 2 Employee Benefit
Trust in all the 588,000 ordinary shares in the Company held by that trust on those dates. Save as mentioned above,
no Director had any interest in any share capital of the Company or of any subsidiary.
