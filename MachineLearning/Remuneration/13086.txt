INTRODUCTION
The following Report outlines the Company's policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors and gives details of the
remuneration packages of Executive Directors and of the fees paid to Non-executive Directors for the year ended 30 September
2005. The Report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985. Part 3 of
Schedule 7A requires designated parts of the Remuneration Report to be audited, whilst other parts are not. Pages 34 to 36 and the
tables thereon comprise the auditable part  of the Remuneration Report. In addition, in preparing this Report, consideration has
been given to the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and to the Combined Code. This Report has been approved by both
the Remuneration Committee and by the Board and it is the intention of the Board to put this Report to an advisory vote of
shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE (COMMITTEE ) AND ADVISERS
In accordance with the Combined Code, the members of the Committee are all independent of management and free from any
business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
During the year, the Committee comprised Richard Wright and Andrew Walker and was chaired by Richard Wright. Mr. Wright
will step down as a member of the Committee with effect from his appointment as Chairman of the Company. Going forwards,
Andrew Walker will chair the Committee and the newly appointed independent Non-executive Director will also be appointed to
the Committee. 
The Chairman is not a member of the Committee but the members of the Committee consult him on issues where his experience
and knowledge are of benefit to the Committee's deliberations and he attends meetings of the Committee by invitation. On
occasions and for matters not related to him, the Group Chief Executive is also consulted on proposals relating to the remuneration
of the other Executive Director and members of the Group's senior management team and he also attends meetings of the
Committee by invitation.
The Committee, on behalf of the Board, determines all elements of the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and
certain senior executives of the Group. It approves the terms of service contracts with Executive Directors and also approves any
compensation arrangements resulting from the termination by the Company of a Director's service contract. The Committee also
approves the grant of any share-based incentive. The terms of reference of the Committee include the following:
  to make recommendations to the Board on the Company's framework of executive remuneration and its cost;
  to review and determine, on behalf of the Board, the remuneration and incentive packages of the Company's Executive Directors
and certain senior executives of the Group to ensure that they are fairly rewarded for their individual contributions to the
Company's overall performance;
  to assist the Board in preparing a report to Shareholders in relation to remuneration;
  to determine the basis on which the employment of the Company's Executive Directors and certain senior executives of the
Group could, if necessary, be terminated; and
  to operate and administer the Company's share-based incentive schemes and employee benefit trust.
During the year, the Committee appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (trading as The Monks Partnership) to advise on the
remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and Watson Wyatt LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to advise on pensions
aspects relating to the same. The Committee also took advice from Addleshaw Goddard, its principal UK lawyers, in respect of
matters arising under the Company's share option schemes.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of Non-executive Directors, other than the Chairman, is reviewed and determined by the other members of the
Board. The remuneration of the Chairman is reviewed and determined on behalf of the Board by the Committee.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Committee and the Board recognise that, in order to attract and retain a senior management team which will secure maximum
shareholder value in a competitive international environment, it is necessary to operate a competitive pay and benefits structure. In
conducting an annual review of the basic salary of the Executive Directors, the Committee takes into account the general
performance and contribution of the individual and also the Group's financial results for the immediately preceding financial year.
The Committee also links the annual bonus awards of each Executive Director to the individual performance of the Executive
Director against specific objectives agreed with the Committee and the financial performance of the Group. In addition, the
Committee encourages each Executive Director to build an appropriate shareholding in the Company through the operation of the
Group's share-based incentive plans described below. Accordingly, there are significant elements of the remuneration packages
which are wholly or partly linked to the performance of the individual or the financial performance of the Company. The
Committee therefore believes that these arrangements align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of shareholders.
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT 32 API Group plc
CURRENT AND FUTURE POLICY
It is the policy of the Committee and the Board to maintain the above approach to remuneration packages for Executive Directors
and other senior executives of the Group for the current financial year and future financial years, subject to review in the light of
any changes in relevant legislation, regulations or market practice. Shareholders will be invited to approve at the forthcoming 2006
Annual General Meeting the adoption of a new performance share plan in which the Executive Directors and certain other members
of the Company's senior management team would be eligible to participate. Further details of this plan are set out below and a full
summary is contained in the separate circular to shareholders which accompanies the Annual Reports and Accounts. Beyond the
adoption of the new plan, no significant changes to the remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors are currently
anticipated. However, the Committee will continue to review base salaries and performance targets to ensure that they align with
the policy of the Committee and the Board and with the Company's strategic objectives from time to time. 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION PACKAGES
The components of the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors are as follows:
Basic Salary - fixed by the Committee taking into account, from time to time, advice of independent consultants regarding the market
level for jobs with similar responsibilities in an appropriate comparator group. Basic salary is normally reviewed as at 1 January each
year and takes account of individual performance during the preceding year and the financial performance of the Group.
Annual Bonus - the amount of the bonus payable each year normally depends upon the achievement by the individual of
performance targets and by the Company of financial targets for the relevant financial year, in each case as agreed by the
Committee. The performance targets for bonus entitlements are intended by the Committee to create keen incentives to perform
at the highest levels. Subject to the successful achievement of all such performance targets, David Walton may earn a maximum
bonus of up to 90% of his basic salary with payment at the upper end of the scale conditional upon truly exceptional individual and
financial performance; Colin Ames may earn a maximum bonus of up to 50% of his basic salary. In addition to any such bonus
payable to Mr. Walton conditional upon the attainment of individual and financial performance targets, the Committee has also put
in place arrangements which are designed - together with the other elements of his remuneration package as detailed within this
report - to ensure his retention within the business which arrangements would see Mr. Walton receive a payment of  42,000 in
December 2006 conditional upon his continuing employment by the Company at that time. 
Share-based Incentive Plans - under the Company's executive share option schemes, Executive Directors and senior executives are
eligible for the grant of options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company. Options are granted at an exercise price not less than
market value at the date of grant and may normally only be exercised if performance targets set at the time of grant have been
achieved. The right to exercise outstanding options is subject to achievement of annual total shareholder return (TSR) of at least
12.5% over a three year performance period. TSR is measured based on an opening value equal to the exercise price and a closing
value of the average of the middle market quotations of an ordinary share in the Company for each of the business days in the last
30 days in the three year period. If TSR is exactly 12.5%, only half the shares under option may be acquired. All the shares may be
acquired if TSR is at least 25%. Where TSR is between 12.5% and 25%, a rising proportion of the shares, calculated on a straight
line basis, may be acquired. 
Details of options granted to Executive Directors which are outstanding and details of the Group's share option schemes are given
on page 35.
Going forward and subject to shareholder approval, the Company intends to adopt a new performance share plan pursuant to which
Executive Directors and certain other members of the Company's senior management team would be eligible for an award of shares,
receipt of which would be contingent upon the attainment of performance targets set at the time of the award. A full summary of
the workings of the plan is contained in the separate circular to shareholders which accompanies the Annual Reports and Accounts
but the underlying performance targets and vesting schedules applying to initial awards would reflect substantially those which
currently apply to awards under the Company's executive share option schemes. Upon adoption of the performance share plan, it
is anticipated that future share-based awards to Executive Directors and other members of the senior management team would be
made under the new plan rather than the executive share option schemes.
In respect both of the Company's executive share option schemes and of the proposed performance share plan, the Committee does
not consider that comparative performance targets are appropriate, given the specialised nature of the Company's business, and
considers that targets related to absolute TSR most appropriately align the interests of the participants with those of shareholders.  
Pensions and Life Assurance - Executive Directors participate in a contributory final salary pension scheme which is Inland
Revenue approved. The scheme provides, at normal retirement age and subject to length of service, a pension of up to two thirds
of pensionable salary at retirement subject to a minimum of 30 years' service with the Group and subject to Inland Revenue limits
and other statutory rules. Pension entitlement is calculated by reference to basic salary only (subject to the earnings cap for pension
purposes) and neither annual bonuses nor benefits in kind are pensionable. Details of the pension benefits which accrued during the
year to the Executive Directors under the scheme are set out below in a separate table. Service as a Non-executive Director is not
pensionable. Life assurance cover is provided based on four times the capped salary. In addition to basic salary, a supplementary
payment is currently made to Executive Directors in order to allow the Executive Directors to make their own additional pension
provision. In 2005, this supplementary payment has been 33% for David Walton and 25% for Colin Ames - in each case of the
difference between the annual earnings cap for pensions and the basic salary. These payments to Mr. Walton and Mr. Ames are
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT 33 API Group plc
shown in the table below under Payment Above Pension Cap . The Committee is currently reviewing those supplementary
arrangements in the light of the forthcoming removal of the annual pensions cap in 2006. In reviewing those arrangements, it is the
intention of the Committee to ensure that an appropriate balance is maintained between the proper control of cost and the necessity
for the Executive Directors to make appropriate pension provision for their future. 
Other benefits - afforded to the Executive Directors include private health care insurance, life assurance, permanent health
insurance (to secure income in the event of ill health or disability) and a company car or equivalent monetary value. The value of
the taxable benefits of the Executive Directors for the year ended 30 September 2005 are shown in the table on page 34 under
Taxable Benefits .
SERVICE CONTRACTS AND TERMINATION
David Walton's service contract with the Company is dated and came into effect on 26 January 2005. Colin Ames' service contract
with the Company is dated and came into effect on 18 November 2004.
The Company may terminate the service contracts of Mr. Walton and Mr. Ames by giving not less than twelve months' notice. Any
compensation payable by the Company would be subject to the normal legal principles of mitigation of loss. No compensation
would be payable if the service contracts were to be terminated by notice from Mr. Walton or Mr. Ames or for lawful early
termination by the Company. There are no provisions for payment of pre-determined compensation under the service contracts
save, in respect of Mr. Walton's service contract, on a change of control or takeover of the company. In those circumstances, Mr.
Walton may terminate his service contract by notice given within 12 months from the date of the change of control or takeover
and, on termination, would be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equivalent to 12 months' salary and the cost to the Company
of providing for 12 months the other benefits and emoluments under his service contract.
In concluding the service contracts for Mr. Walton and Mr. Ames, the Committee had due regard to the provisions of the Combined
Code referring to the notice periods for service contracts.
In relation to future appointments of Executive Directors, the Committee's and Board's policy will remain one of restricting notice
periods for terminating service contracts to one year - although the Committee and the Board may, in appropriate circumstances,
offer longer initial notice periods which would reduce to one year.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' LETTERS OF ENGAGEMENT
The Company's practice is to appoint Non-executive Directors under letters of engagement rather than under service contracts.
Those letters of engagement set out fixed terms of appointment (normally 3 years) which may be extended with the agreement of
the Board. David Hudd currently serves the Company as Non-executive Chairman. He was appointed under a letter of engagement
dated 2 July 1998 and, following its expiry, his appointment was renewed for further successive periods of three years on 2 July
2001 and 2 July 2004 respectively under further letters of engagement. Richard Wright was appointed to the Board under a letter
of engagement dated 3 September 2001 which expired on 2 September 2004 and his appointment was extended for a further three
years from 3 September 2004 under a further letter of engagement. Andrew Walker was appointed to the Board under a letter of
engagement dated 25 July 2003 for a term of three years which will expire on 24 July 2006
PERFORMANCE GRAPH
Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 requires listed companies to provide, by graph, an analysis of the performance of the
Company (being total shareholder return) over time as compared with an appropriate and broad equity market index. The graph
below shows the total shareholder return (with dividends reinvested) in terms of the change in value over the last five financial years
(beginning on 1 October 2000 and ending on 30 September 2005) of an initial investment in the Company's shares against a
corresponding investment in a hypothetical holding of shares in the companies represented in FTSE All Share index. The FTSE All Share
index has been selected because it is a very broad equity market index which includes the Company's shares and the Committee
believes that no other index would provide a more appropriate comparator, given the specialist nature of the Group's activities.

The bonus payable to David Walton reflects the attainment of certain strategic business objectives identified as key by the
Committee at the beginning of the financial year, including the successful disposal of the Company's non-core operations on
favourable terms. The bonus payable to Colin Ames reflects his successful achievement during the year of certain individual
performance targets put in place by the Committee. No bonus has been paid to Mr. Walton or Mr. Ames in respect of those
proportions of their maximum bonus entitlements which were linked to the attainment by the Group of financial performance
targets for the year. 
Included in the above table are the Taxable Benefits  received by the Directors which include the matters set out below:
David Walton received a payment for the equivalent monetary value of providing a company car which, during the year, amounted
to  15,000. The Taxable Benefits  for Colin Ames include the taxable value (being  8,151) of a company car provided to him
during the year. The Taxable Benefits  for each also include an allowance in respect of private mileage fuel costs totaling in the case
of Mr. Walton  3,416 and in the case of Mr. Ames  1,750. 
The Taxable Benefits  for David Walton and Colin Ames include the taxable value of the provision to them of private health
insurance cover and, in respect of Mr. Walton, unapproved life assurance cover.
The remuneration of the Chairman and other Non-executive Directors consists only of annual fees for their services both as
members of the Board and of the Committees on which they serve, although the fees paid to Richard Wright include additional
fees paid to him since October 2004 of  14,000 relating to additional services provided by him, at the request of the Board, in
chairing the team supervising the Group's process management and improvement programmes.

Notes:
1. Granted under the Company's approved share option plan 2002 (Approved Plan). No price is payable for the grant of an option.
2. Granted under the Company's unapproved share option plan 2002 (Unapproved Plan). No price is payable for the grant of an
option.
3. The right to exercise all options granted to an individual on the same day (whether under the Approved Plan or the Unapproved
Plan) is subject to achievement of total shareholder return (TSR) of at least 12.5% over three years from the date of grant. TSR
is measured based on an opening value equal to the exercise price and a closing value of the average of the middle market
quotations of an ordinary share in the Company for each of the business days in the last 30 days in the three year period. If TSR
is exactly 12.5%, only half the total number of shares under option may be acquired. All the shares may be acquired if TSR is
at least 25%. Where TSR is between 12.5% and 25%, a rising proportion of the shares, calculated on a straight line basis, may
be acquired.
4. In relation to these options granted on the same day, if TSR over the three years from the date of grant is at least 12.5%, the
option holder may acquire all the shares under option under the Approved Plan but may only exercise the option granted under
the Unapproved Plan to acquire the balance of the shares in respect of which the options have become exercisable in accordance
with the performance condition.
5. Notwithstanding their grant on 7 June 2005, the performance period in respect of these options is the three years from 26
November 2004, that being considered appropriate by the Committee in the light of certain restrictions under the Listing Rules
which prohibited the proposed grant of such options on that date and continued in effect until June 2005. The right to exercise
the options is otherwise as set out at note 3 above. 
The mid-market price of the Company's shares at 30 September 2005 was 137.5 pence and the range during 2004/2005 was 76.5
pence to 187.5 pence. 36 API Group plc

at the above dates. David Walton and Colin Ames were at 1 October 2004, at 30 September 2005 and at 6 December 2005, deemed
to be interested as discretionary beneficiaries of the Company's No. 2 Employee Benefit Trust in all the ordinary shares in the

Company or of any subsidiary.
