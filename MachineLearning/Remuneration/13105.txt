DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
INTRODUCTION
The following Report outlines the Company's policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors and gives details of the remuneration packages of
Executive Directors and of the fees paid to Non-executive Directors for the year ended 30 September 2006. The Report has been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.  Part 3 of Schedule 7A requires designated parts of the Remuneration
Report to be audited, whilst other parts are not. Pages 27 to 30 and the tables thereon comprise the auditable part  of the Remuneration Report. In
addition, in preparing this Report, consideration has been given to the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and to the Combined Code.
This Report has been approved by both the Remuneration Committee and by the Board and it is the intention of the Board to put this Report to an
advisory vote of Shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE (THE COMMITTEE ) AND ADVISERS
In accordance with the Combined Code, the members of the Committee are all independent of management and free from any business or other
relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
During the year, the Committee comprised Richard Wright (until his appointment as Chairman on 1 February 2006 when he resigned from the
Committee), Andrew Walker and (with effect from his appointment on 1 February 2006) Brian Birkenhead. The Committee was chaired by Richard
Wright until 1 February 2006 and, thereafter and for the remainder of the year, by Andrew Walker.
Although he is no longer a member of the Committee, the members of the Committee consult the Chairman on issues where his experience and
knowledge are of benefit to their deliberations and he attends meetings of the Committee by invitation. On occasions and for matters not related to
him, the Group Chief Executive is also consulted on proposals relating to the remuneration of members of the Group's senior management team and
he also attends meetings of the Committee by invitation.
The Committee, on behalf of the Board, determines all elements of the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and the framework and broad
policy for the remuneration of other members of the senior executive management of the Group. It approves the terms of service contracts with
Executive Directors and also approves any compensation arrangements resulting from the termination by the Company of a Director's service contract.
The Committee also approves the grant of long term incentives.  The terms of reference of the Committee include the following:
  to make recommendations to the Board on the Company's framework of executive remuneration and its cost;
  to review and determine, on behalf of the Board, the remuneration and incentive packages of the Company's Executive Directors to ensure that they
are fairly rewarded for their individual contributions to the Company's overall performance;
  to assist the Board in preparing a report to Shareholders in relation to remuneration;
  to determine the basis on which the employment of the Company's Executive Directors and certain senior executives of the Group could, if required,
be terminated; and
  to operate and administer the Company's long term incentive schemes and employee benefit trust.
During the year, the Committee appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (trading as The Monks Partnership) to advise on the remuneration packages
of certain senior executives of the Group and on the design and implementation of a new long term incentive arrangement for the Group, the API Group
plc 2006 Performance Share Plan, which was adopted by shareholders at the 2006 Annual General Meeting.  Watson Wyatt LLP and
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were also engaged to advise on pensions aspects relating to certain senior executives. The Committee also took advice
from Addleshaw Goddard, its principal UK lawyers, in respect of matters arising under the Company's long term incentive schemes and on matters
related to the termination of the employment and directorship of Colin Ames. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP also provide taxation services to the Group.
No Director was involved in deciding the level and composition of his own remuneration.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of Non-executive Directors, other than the Chairman, is reviewed and determined by the other members of the Board.
The remuneration of the Chairman is reviewed and determined on behalf of the Board by the Committee.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Committee and the Board recognise that, in order to attract and retain a senior management team which will secure maximum shareholder value
in a competitive international environment, it is necessary to operate a competitive pay and benefits structure.  In conducting an annual review of the
basic salary of any Executive Director, the Committee takes into account the general performance and contribution of the individual and also
the Group's financial results for the immediately preceding financial year. The Committee also links the annual bonus awards of Executive
Directors to individual performance against specific objectives determined by the Committee and the financial performance of the Group.  Page 25
API Group plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2006
In addition, the Committee encourages Executive Directors to build an appropriate shareholding in the Company through the operation of the
Group's long term incentive plans described below. Accordingly, there are significant elements of the remuneration packages which are wholly or
partly linked to the performance of the individual or the financial performance of the Company. The Committee therefore believes that these
arrangements align the interests of any Executive Director with those of Shareholders.
CURRENT AND FUTURE POLICY
It is the policy of the Committee and the Board to maintain the above approach to remuneration packages for Executive Directors and other senior
executives of the Group for the current financial year and future financial years, subject to review in the light of any changes in relevant legislation,
regulations or market practice. Accordingly, no significant changes to the remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors are currently
anticipated. However, the Committee will continue to review base salaries and performance targets to ensure that they align with the policy of the
Committee and the Board and with the Company's strategic objectives from time to time. 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION PACKAGES
The components of the remuneration packages for the Group Chief Executive are as follows:
Basic Salary - fixed by the Committee taking into account, from time to time, advice of independent consultants regarding the market level for jobs
with similar responsibilities in an appropriate comparator group. Basic salary is normally reviewed as at 1 January each year and takes account of
individual performance during the preceding year and the financial performance of the Group.
Annual Bonus - the amount of the bonus payable depends upon the achievement by the individual of performance targets and by the Company of
financial targets for the relevant financial year, in each case as agreed by the Committee. The performance targets for bonus entitlements are intended
by the Committee to create keen incentives to perform at the highest levels. Subject to the successful achievement of all such performance targets,
David Walton may earn a maximum bonus of up to 100% of his basic salary. In addition to any such bonus payable to Mr. Walton conditional upon
the attainment of individual and financial performance targets, the Committee put in place arrangements in 2005 which were designed - together
with the other elements of his remuneration package as detailed within this report - to ensure his retention within the business which arrangements
would see Mr. Walton receive a payment of  42,000 in December 2006.
Long Term Incentives - the Company operates a number of executive share option or incentive schemes. At the 2006 Annual General Meeting
the Company adopted the API Group plc 2006 Performance Share Plan (PSP ) as a new long term incentive plan. The PSP allows for the awards
of both nil cost  share options and contingent share awards (Awards ) and it is intended that Awards will be made under the PSP annually to
Executive Directors and members of the senior executive team to incentivise them to attain pre-determined performance targets which are
directly linked to shareholder value. Awards will normally only vest if performance targets set at the time of grant have been achieved. In respect
of those Awards made during the year, the performance targets relate to growth in compounded annual total shareholder return (TSR) over a
three year period from the date of grant. TSR is measured based on an opening value of the average of the middle market quotations of an
ordinary share in the Company for each of the 30 business days up to and including the date of grant and a closing value of the average of the
middle market quotations of an ordinary share in the Company for each of the last 30 business days in the three year period. No proportion of
the Awards will vest if the TSR is less than 12.5% over the three year performance period. If TSR is exactly 12.5%, only half the shares within
the Award may be acquired. All the shares may be acquired if TSR is at least 25%. Where TSR is between 12.5% and 25%, a rising proportion
of the Award, calculated on a straight line basis, may be acquired. The Committee does not consider that comparative performance targets are
appropriate, given the specialised nature of the Company's business, and considers that targets related to absolute TSR most appropriately align
the interests of the Executive Directors with those of Shareholders. The Committee also considers that a key element of any effective incentive
scheme is transparency for participants and that the adoption of absolute targets, rather than targets measured against a comparator group, allows
participants to properly understand the performance targets to be attained and more effectively incentivises them to increase shareholder value.
The Committee currently intends to apply the same targets to future awards under the PSP and to make future long term incentive awards under
the PSP rather than any other share option plan in effect.
Details of awards over shares granted to Executive Directors which are outstanding and details of the Group's long term incentive plans are given on
page 29.
Pensions and Life Assurance - The Group Chief Executive participates in a contributory final salary pension scheme which is Inland Revenue
approved. The scheme provides, at normal retirement age and subject to length of service, a pension of up to two thirds of pensionable salary at
retirement subject to a minimum of 30 years' service with the Group and subject to Revenue limits and other statutory rules.  Pension entitlement is
calculated by reference to basic salary only (subject, notwithstanding the disapplication by HMRC of the former earnings cap for pension purposes,
to a scheme-specific earnings cap which broadly equates to the former HMRC cap) and neither annual bonuses nor benefits in kind are pensionable.
Details of the pension benefits which accrued during the year to the Executive Directors under the scheme are set out below in a separate table. Page 26
API Group plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2006
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
Service as a Non-executive Director is not pensionable. Life assurance cover is provided based on four times the capped salary. In addition to basic
salary, a supplementary payment is currently made to Executive Directors in order to allow the Executive Directors to make their own additional
pension provision. In 2006, the supplementary payment made to David Walton was 33% of the difference between the scheme-specific annual
earnings cap and his annual basic salary. The payment to Mr. Walton is shown in the table below under Payment Above Pension Cap .
Other benefits - the Executive Directors were also provided during the year with private health care insurance, life assurance, permanent health
insurance (to secure income in the event of ill health or disability) and a company car or equivalent monetary value. The value of the taxable benefits
of the Executive Directors for the year ended 30 September 2006 are shown in the table on page 27 under Taxable Benefits .
SERVICE CONTRACTS AND TERMINATION
David Walton's service contract with the Company is dated and came into effect on 26 January 2005. The Company may terminate the service
contract by giving not less than twelve months' notice. No compensation would be payable if Mr. Walton's service contract was to be terminated by
notice from him or on lawful early termination by the Company.  Any compensation payable by the Company would be subject to the normal legal
principles of mitigation of loss and there are no provisions for payment of pre-determined compensation under the service contract save on a change
of control or takeover of the company. In those circumstances, Mr. Walton may terminate his service contract by notice given within 12 months from
the date of the change of control or takeover and, on termination, would be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equivalent to 12 months' salary
and the cost to the Company of providing for 12 months the other benefits and emoluments under his service contract. In concluding the service
contract for Mr. Walton, the Committee had due regard to the provisions of the Combined Code referring to the notice periods for service contracts.
In relation to future appointments of Executive Directors, the Committee's and Board's policy will remain one of restricting notice periods for
terminating service contracts to one year - although the Committee and the Board may, in appropriate circumstances, offer longer initial notice periods
which would reduce to one year.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' LETTERS OF ENGAGEMENT
The Company's practice is to appoint Non-executive Directors under letters of engagement rather than under service contracts. Those letters of
engagement set out fixed terms of appointment (of no more than 3 years) which may be extended upon the recommendation of the Nominations
Committee and with the agreement of the Board. Richard Wright currently serves the Company as Non-executive Chairman. He was appointed 
as Non-executive Director under a letter of engagement dated 3 September 2001 and, following its expiry on 2 September 2004, his appointment was
extended for a further three years until 2 September 2007.  Andrew Walker was appointed to the Board under a letter of engagement dated 25 July
2003 for a term of three years which expired on 24 July 2006 and was re-appointed to the Board for a further three years under a letter of engagement
dated 25 July 2006 which will expire on 24 July 2009. Brian Birkenhead was appointed to the Board under a letter of engagement dated 1 February
2006 for a term of three years which will expire on 31 January 2009. Martin O'Connell was appointed to the Board under a letter of engagement
dated 21 April 2006 for a term of three years commencing on 1 May 2006 which will expire on 30 April 2009. Luke Wiseman was appointed to the
Board under a letter of engagement dated 31 August 2006 for a term of one year commencing 1 September 2006 which will expire on 31 August 2007.
PERFORMANCE GRAPH
Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 requires listed companies to provide, by graph, an analysis of the performance of the Company (being total
shareholder return) over time as compared with an appropriate and broad equity market index. The graph below shows the total shareholder return (with
dividends reinvested) in terms of the change in value over the last five financial years (beginning on 1 October 2001 and ending on 30 September 2006)
of an initial investment in the Company's shares against a corresponding investment in a hypothetical holding of shares in the companies represented in
FTSE All Share index. The FTSE All Share index has been selected because it is a very broad equity market index which includes the Company's shares
and the Committee believes that no other index would provide a more appropriate comparator, given the specialist nature of the Group's activities. Page 27

compensation for loss of office  includes both cash compensation paid to Mr. Ames on the termination of his employment and the value of continued life
assurance cover which the Company agreed to provide to him (estimated value of  3,000). Mr. Ames was also granted an augmentation to the benefits which
have been accrued within the API Group Life Assurance and Pension Fund equal to one year's pensionable service in respect of which the Company was required
to make a payment into the Fund of  28,300, of which  7,600 was borne by Mr. Ames, comprising one year's member contributions.  Mr. Ames will also retain
until 31 August 2007 his entitlement to certain share options which had been granted to him in March 2002 under the Company's 2002 share option plan and
which had vested prior to the termination of his employment; all other options over shares which Mr. Ames held lapsed on the termination of his employment.
Further details are set out under the heading Directors' Interest in Shares . In addition, the Company entered into a consultancy agreement with Mr. Ames
pursuant to which he remains available to provide consultancy services to the Company over a five year period for which he will be paid an aggregate amount
of  170,000 in instalments over that period.
The following section of the Directors' Remuneration Report (pages 27 to 30 - including the tables on those pages) comprise the auditable part  of

Included in the above table are the Taxable Benefits  received by the Executive Directors which include the matters set out below:
For the month of October 2005, David Walton received a payment for the equivalent monetary value of providing a company car; thereafter, the

of the car provided to him ( 22,000). The Taxable Benefits  for Colin Ames include the taxable value of a company car provided to him during the
year until the termination of his employment on 31 August 2006 ( 7,700). The Taxable Benefits  for each of Mr. Walton and Mr. Ames also include
an allowance in respect of private mileage fuel costs totaling, in the case of Mr. Walton,  4,870 and, in the case of Mr. Ames,  1,500.
The Taxable Benefits  for David Walton and Colin Ames include the taxable value of the provision to them of private health insurance cover and
unapproved life assurance cover.
The remuneration of the Chairman and other Non-executive Directors consists only of annual fees for their services both as members of the Board
and of the Committees on which they serve save that the fees paid to Richard Wright include additional fees paid to him of  4,666 relating to
additional services provided by him over the period from 1 October 2005 to 31 January 2006, at the request of the Board, in chairing the team
supervising the Group's process management and improvement programmes. With effect from his appointment as Non-executive Chairman on 1

Notes:
1. Granted under the Company's approved share option plan 2002 (Approved Plan). No price is payable for the grant of an option.
2. Granted under the Company's unapproved share option plan 2002 (Unapproved Plan). No price is payable for the grant of an option.
3. The right to exercise all options granted to an individual on the same day (whether under the Approved Plan or the Unapproved Plan) is
subject to achievement of compounded annual total shareholder return (TSR) of at least 12.5% over three years from the date of grant. 
TSR is measured based on an opening value equal to the exercise price and a closing value of the average of the middle market quotations of
an ordinary share in the Company for each of the business days in the last 30 days in the three year period. If TSR is exactly 12.5%, only half
the total number of shares under option may be acquired. All the shares may be acquired if TSR is at least 25%. Where TSR is between 12.5%
and 25%, a rising proportion of the shares, calculated on a straight line basis, may be acquired.
4. In relation to those options granted on the same day, if TSR over the three years from the date of grant is at least 12.5%, the option holder
may acquire all the shares under option under the Approved Plan but may only exercise the option granted under the Unapproved Plan to
acquire the balance of the shares in respect of which the options have become exercisable in accordance with the performance condition.
5. Notwithstanding their grant on 7 June 2005, the performance period in respect of these options is the three years from 26 November 2004,
that being considered appropriate by the Committee in the light of certain restrictions under the Listing Rules which prohibited the proposed
grant of such options in November 2004 and continued in effect until June 2005. The right to exercise the options is otherwise as set out at
note 3 above.
6. Granted under the Performance Share Plan (PSP); the award is in the form of nil cost  options over shares and no price is payable for the
grant of the options. The right to exercise the options is subject to the achievement of certain total shareholder return (TSR) targets over a
three year period from the date of grant. TSR is measured based on an opening value of the average of the middle market quotations of an
ordinary share in the Company for each of the 30 business days up to and including the date of grant and a closing value of the average of the
middle market quotations of an ordinary share in the Company for each of the last 30 business days in the three year period. No proportion
of the awards will vest if the TSR is less than 12.5% over the three year performance period. If TSR is exactly 12.5%, only half the shares
within the award may be acquired. All the shares may be acquired if TSR is at least 25%. Where TSR is between 12.5% and 25%, a rising
proportion of the award, calculated on a straight line basis, may be acquired.
7. The Remuneration Committee has exercised its discretion to allow Mr. Ames to retain the benefit of these options, which wholly vested in
March 2005, until 31 August 2007 being the first anniversary of the termination of his employment by the Company. All other options
granted to him lapsed following the termination of his employment.
The mid-market price of the Company's shares at 30 September 2006 was 84.5p and the range during the period under review was 79.0p to 138.5p. Page 30
