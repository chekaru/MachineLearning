Remuneration report

Remuneration policy The principal function of the Remuneration Committee is to determine the remuneration packages of all executive
directors and approve those of senior management. This includes pension contributions, bonus payments, share options and service contracts.
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Gregorio Reyes, and its other members are Dennis Millard and Jan Tufvesson. There have been 
no changes to the Committee during the year.
The Company operates a remuneration policy for executive directors and senior management designed to ensure it attracts and retains 
the management skills necessary for it to remain a leader in its field. The Committee believes that directors' and senior managers' total
remuneration should seek to recognise their worth in the external market.
The policy on executive director and senior management remuneration and appointments is set out below.
Policy on remuneration of executive directors and senior management
i) Company policy In determining the Company's policy on remuneration, the Remuneration Committee has regard to the following objectives:
a) Remuneration packages offered are designed to be competitive, being comparable with packages available within other groups operating 
in similar markets and on a similar scale, including competitors.
b) Remuneration packages are fixed so as to attract, retain and motivate executives of the highest calibre, and at the same time optimise 
interests of shareholders. The Committee takes into account the Company's strive towards profitability when reviewing the monetary compensation
that is awarded to directors and senior management.
c) Share option grants are a significant element of Company performance-related remuneration which align with the Group's achievement of 
its results. Options are awarded on the commencement of employment and are granted by the Remuneration Committee at the next available
meeting. Each employee of the Company partakes in the executive share option programme and the Board considers this to be a significant
employee motivator in the current difficult industry environment. The Committee reviews the number of share options that directors and employees
have been awarded and the exercise price to ensure that they remain effective. The Board is proposing a change to the share option scheme
rules to allow it to keep up to date with current best practice on the levels of grant of share options to individuals.
ii) Basic salary In assessing the level of basic salary, the Remuneration Committee takes account of the pay practices of other companies, 
the responsibilities of each director, and pay awards elsewhere in the Group. Salaries are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
iii) Bonus payments Bonus payments are paid to executive directors, of up to 50% of base salary, and senior management based on objectives
set for each individual.
iv) Long-term incentive plans and interests of shareholders The Remuneration Committee reviews the level of option awards to ensure that 
they are consistent with the industry. It is the Board's intention to continue to grant share options to executive directors to reward the directors 
for their contribution towards the long-term profitability of the Company. The Board considers that the granting of share options without
performance criteria is in the best interests of the shareholders given the Company is not a mature company operating in a stable environment.
The Board considers that the use of performance criteria should be constantly reviewed to ensure that the best interests of shareholders 
are maintained. The options of the directors are set out in the table on page 21.
v) Pensions Post-retirement benefits, which comprise only pensions, are based on contributions to a defined contribution scheme of up 
to 5% matched by the employee, paid into a UK personal pension plan. The contribution is based on salary and bonus payments in line 
with Company policy for all UK employees, and is a standard UK contract term. Appropriate defined contribution pension schemes are 
also available for our non-UK employees. 19
Service agreements Mike Gulett has a rolling  service contract which is terminable on one year's notice from the Company or three months
from this director. This agreement provides for the director to provide services to the Company on a full-time basis. The agreement contains
restrictive covenants for periods of 12 months post employment relating to non-competition, non-solicitation of the Group's customers, suppliers and
employees and indefinitely with respect to confidential information and provides for the Group to own any intellectual property rights created by
the directors in the course of their employment. The Company allows the executive directors to hold non-executive positions outside the Company.

ARC International share price relative to FTSE Techmark 100 and FTSE IT Hardware
Since the admission to the London Stock Exchange, the Company initially performed well but has since declined in line with the general market
trend. The Company has given a negative 88% return and therefore outperformed the FTSE IT Hardware price index, which gave a negative
return of 97%, but under performed the FTSE Techmark 100 price index which has given an 83% negative return. However, during 2002 the
Company has outperformed both the IT Hardware and Techmark 100 indices (negative 45% vs negative 82% and negative 56% respectively).
In the opinion of the directors, these indices are the most appropriate indices to measure the total shareholder return of the Company because
these indices comprise similar companies to the Company.
