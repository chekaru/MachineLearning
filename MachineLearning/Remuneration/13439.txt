 Remuneration policy The principal function of the Remuneration Committee is to determine the remuneration packages of all executive
directors and approve those of senior management. This includes pension contributions, bonus payments, share options and service contracts.
Since September 2003 the members of the Remuneration Committee are Geoff Bristow and Richard Barfield (previously Greg Reyes and
Michael Risman). The Committee has only two members as permitted under the Code of Corporate Governance for Smaller Companies.
The Committee has access to outside professional advisers, generally appointed by the Senior Vice President of Human Resources or the
Company Secretary. During 2003, Macfarlanes and WestLB Panmure provided advice on share option plans for the Company.
The Company operates a remuneration policy for executive directors and senior management designed to ensure it attracts and retains 
the management skills necessary for it to remain a leader in its field. The Committee believes that directors' and senior managers' total
remuneration should seek to recognise their worth in the external market.
The policy on executive director and senior management remuneration and appointments is set out below.
Policy on remuneration of executive directors and senior management
i) Company policy In determining the Company's policy on remuneration, the Remuneration Committee has regard to the following objectives:
a) Remuneration packages offered are designed to be competitive, being comparable with packages available within other groups operating 
in similar markets and on a similar scale, including competitors.
b) Remuneration packages are fixed so as to attract, retain and motivate executives of the highest calibre, and at the same time optimise 
interests of shareholders. The Committee takes into account that the Company is striving towards profitability when reviewing the monetary
compensation that is awarded to directors and senior management.
c) Share option grants are a significant element of Company performance-related remuneration which align with the Group's achievement of 
its results. Options are awarded on the commencement of employment and are granted by the Remuneration Committee at the next available
meeting. Each employee of the Company participates in the executive share option programme and the Board considers this to be a
significant employee motivator in the current difficult industry environment. The Committee reviews the number of share options that directors
and employees have been awarded and the exercise price to ensure that they remain effective. The grants to individual employees are limited
under the scheme rules to normal market practice of one times salary in any year (the exception being the grant made in connection with the
recruitment of the new CEO which is within four times salary). The Company operates an Inland Revenue approved scheme that vests after
three years, an unapproved scheme and an incentive stock option plan that have a vesting schedule of 25% on the first anniversary and then
monthly over 36 months.
ii) Basic salary In assessing the level of basic salary, the Remuneration Committee takes account of the pay practices of other companies, 
the responsibilities of each director and senior manager, and pay awards elsewhere in the Group. Salaries are reviewed annually by the
Remuneration Committee.
iii) Bonus payments Bonus payments are paid to executive directors, of up to 50% of base salary, and senior management based on
objectives set for each individual. However, no bonuses have been paid for 2003.
iv) Long-term incentive plans and interests of shareholders The Remuneration Committee reviews the level of option awards to ensure that 
they are consistent with the industry. It is the Board's intention to continue to grant share options to executive directors to reward the directors
for their contribution towards the long-term profitability of the Company. The Remuneration Committee considers that the granting of share
options without performance criteria is in the best interests of the shareholders because the Company is not a mature company operating 
in a stable environment, and competes in the US market where performance conditions are not market practice. The Remuneration Committee
considers that the use of performance criteria should be constantly reviewed to ensure that the best interests of shareholders 
are maintained. The options of the directors are set out in the table on page 22.
v) Pensions Post-retirement benefits, which comprise only pensions, are based on contributions to a defined contribution scheme of up to 
5% matched by the employee, paid into a UK personal pension plan. The contribution is based on salary and bonus payments in line with
market practice and Company policy for all UK employees, and is a standard UK contract term. Appropriate defined contribution pension
schemes are also available for our non-UK employees.
Restricted shares granted to Carl Schlachte Carl Schlachte was awarded 1,500,000 0.1p ordinary shares, subject to restrictions, in the
Company on 25 February 2004. The award was made without the prior approval of shareholders (in accordance with paragraph 13.13A 
of the Listing Rules), as the award was made to facilitate the recruitment of Carl Schlachte as the new Chief Executive Officer to replace Mike
Gulett who resigned in December 2003. The shares will be sourced from the shares held within the ARC International Employee Benefit Trust.
After considering various potential candidates the Remuneration Committee concluded that the new Chief Executive Officer would best 
be recruited from the Silicon Valley area of California, USA, and that a commensurate offer of equity incentives would be needed. 
The arrangement was adapted specifically to facilitate Carl Schlachte's recruitment and will not be repeated.
The principal terms of the arrangement can be summarised as follows:
1An award over 1,500,000 0.1p ordinary shares was granted to Mr Schlachte as soon as practicable after he joined the Company.
REMUNERATION REPORT
20 ARC International plc Annual report and accounts 2003 2 The number of shares subject to the award may be adjusted in the event of a rights issue, capitalisation issue, share split, consolidation 
of shares or reduction of capital of the Company subject to written confirmation of the auditors that such adjustment is fair and reasonable.
3 The share award is restricted. The restrictions lift as certain revenue targets are met by the Company. These targets are based on the
revenue generated from licence sales of processors (the ARC 600, ARC 700 and future processors in development; processors already
developed before these and revenues from maintenance and royalty income are not included). There are four performance criteria, each of
which allows for a lifting of restrictions over 25% of the award. They are sequential in magnitude (ranging from $3 million to $18 million).
4 Upon termination of his employment, without advance notice, he will be entitled to those shares that have already had the restrictions lifted.
5 On a change in control of the Company, the shares may, with the consent of the company acquiring control of the Company and the
director, be exchanged in consideration for the grant of equivalent rights over the shares of the acquiring company, otherwise the
restrictions will be waived.
6 Until the restriction on the shares are lifted, Mr Schlachte has no voting rights or other rights in respect of the ordinary shares subject 
to the award. The term of the award is a maximum of three years. 
7The award is not pensionable.
8 The provisions of the award which determine the number of shares Mr Schlachte may receive under the award and the adjustment
provisions described in 2 above may not be awarded to the advantage of Mr Schlachte without shareholder approval (save for minor
amendments to benefit the administration of the awards, to take account of changes in applicable legislation or to obtain or maintain
favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for Mr Schlachte, the Company or the Group).
Service agreements Carl Schlachte has a rolling  service contract which is terminable on six months' notice from the Company or the
director. This agreement provides for the director to provide services to the Company on a full-time basis. The agreement contains restrictive
covenants for periods of 12 months post employment relating to non-competition, non-solicitation of the Group's customers, suppliers and
employees and indefinitely with respect to confidential information and provide for the Group to own any intellectual property rights created 
by the directors in the course of their employment. The Company allows the executive director to hold non-executive positions outside 
the Company.
All the non-executive directors have service agreements as detailed.
