 Remuneration policy 
The principal function of the Remuneration Committee is to determine the remuneration packages of all executive directors and approve those of senior management. 
This includes pension contributions, bonus payments, share options and service contracts.
Since September 2003, the members of the Remuneration Committee have been Geoff Bristow and Richard Barfield. The Committee has two members as permitted under
the Code of Corporate Governance for smaller companies.
The Committee has access to outside professional advisers, generally appointed by the Committee or the Company Secretary. During 2004, Macfarlanes and New Bridge
Street Consultants provided advice on share option plans for the Company.
The Company operates a remuneration policy for executive directors and senior management designed to ensure it attracts and retains the management skills necessary for 
it to remain a leader in its field. The Committee believes that directors' and senior managers' total remuneration should seek to recognise their worth in the external market.
The policy on executive director and senior management remuneration and appointments is set out below.
Policy on remuneration of executive directors and senior management for current and future periods
i) Company policy In determining the Company's policy on remuneration, the Remuneration Committee has regard to the following objectives:
a) Remuneration packages offered are designed to be competitive, being comparable with packages available within other groups operating in similar markets and on 
a similar scale, including competitors.
b) Remuneration packages are fixed so as to attract, retain and motivate executives of the highest calibre, and at the same time optimise interests of shareholders. The
Committee takes into account that the Company is striving towards profitability when reviewing the monetary compensation that is awarded to directors and senior management.
ii) Basic salary In assessing the level of basic salary, the Remuneration Committee takes account of the pay practices of other companies, the responsibilities of each
director and senior manager, and pay awards elsewhere in the Group. Salaries are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
iii) Bonus payments Bonus payments are paid to executive directors, of up to 50% of base salary, and senior management based on objectives, including revenue,
operating cost and cash flow targets, set for each individual. The bonuses paid for the year ended 31 December 2004 were $90,000 ( 46,877) or 36% of base salary
to the Chief Executive Officer and 12.5% of base salary to other senior management.
iv) Share options Share option grants are a significant element of Company performance-related remuneration which align with the Group's achievement of its results. Share
options are awarded on the commencement of employment and are granted by the Remuneration Committee at the next available meeting. Each employee of the Company
participates in the executive share option programme and the Board considers this to be a significant employee motivator in the current difficult industry environment. 
The Committee reviews the number of share options that directors and employees have been awarded and the exercise price to ensure that they remain effective. The grants
to individual employees are limited under the scheme rules to normal market practice of one times salary in any year (the exception being the grant made in connection with
the recruitment of the new CEO which is within four times salary). The Company operates an Inland Revenue approved scheme that vests after three years, an unapproved
scheme and an incentive stock option plan that have a vesting schedule of 25% on the first anniversary and then monthly over 36 months.
REMUNERATION REPORT
18 ARC International plc Annual report and accounts 2004 v) Long-term incentive plans and interests of shareholders The Remuneration Committee reviews the level of option awards to ensure that they are consistent with the
industry. It is the Board's intention to continue to grant share options to executive directors to reward them for their contribution towards the long-term profitability of the
Company. The Remuneration Committee constantly reviews the use of performance criteria when awarding share options and restricted shares. The Committee feels that
performance criteria should be used in some instances, notably with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, where there is an element with both performance criteria
and without. The options granted to the directors are set out in the table on page 22.
vi) Pensions Post-retirement benefits, which comprise only pensions, are based on contributions to a defined contribution scheme of up to 5% matched by the employee, 
paid into a UK personal pension plan. The contribution is based on salary and bonus payments in line with market practice and Company policy for all UK employees, 
and is a standard UK contract term. Appropriate defined contribution pension schemes are also available for our non-UK employees. The bonus paid to the executive
director is not pensionable.
vii) Duration and termination Executive directors have employment agreements with a maximum notice period of 12 months. For Mr Schlachte this is six months. 
Non-executive directors have service agreements for a maximum of three years with no contractual termination payments.
Non-executive directors do not participate in the Company's executive share option scheme, long-term incentive plan or pension schemes. The Chairman has a share based
award approved by the shareholders at the AGM on 21 July 2004.
Service agreements
Carl Schlachte has a rolling  service contract which is terminable on six months' notice from either party. This agreement provides for him to provide services to the
Company on a full-time basis. The agreement contains restrictive covenants for periods of 12 months post-employment relating to non-competition, non-solicitation of the
Group's customers, suppliers and employees and indefinitely with respect to confidential information and provides for the Group to own any intellectual property rights
created by him in the course of his employment. The Company allows Carl Schlachte to hold non-executive positions outside the Company.
All the non-executive directors have service agreements as detailed.

The interest in executive options over shares in the Company as at 31 December 2004 for the directors is as follows:
Number at Number at Exercise Date from

Carl Schlachte has options that vest 25% on the anniversary of grant and then monthly over three years. Jez San, Richard Barfield, Geoff Bristow and Peter van Cuylenburg 
have not had any interest in executive options granted to them during the year.
Share based awards
Dr van Cuylenburg and Mr Schlachte were awarded the following share based awards in 2004:
Performance criteria based: cumulative revenue Time based
3 September 3 March 3 September
Targets  3 million  7 million  12 million  18 million 2005 2006 2006
Dr van Cuylenburg - share based award 156,250 156,250 156,250 156,250 125,000 125,000 125,000
Mr C Schlachte - restricted shares held in EBT 375,000 375,000 375,000 375,000 - - -
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed whether the performance criteria of cumulative revenue from new processor licence revenue have been met, and determined that
the  3 million target has been met. The Committee will therefore recommend to the Trustees of the Employee Benefit Trust that Mr Schlachte's restrictions be lifted and that 
Dr van Cuylenburg's award vests, as they relate to the first award. The time based award vests if Dr van Cuylenburg is a director of the Company on the date specified.
The share based awards give rise to a charge to the profit and loss account of  321,000 for 2004. This is calculated taking the value of the award over the expected
period of benefit to the director. The benefit is calculated using the share price at the date of the award less any amounts payable by the director. The expected period 
is based on an assessment of when the individual performance criteria will be reached or in the case of the non-performance award the period to each date. Each
performance criteria award is charged separately over its individual expected vesting period.
All executive share options are issued at market value. The market price of the Company's shares at the end of the year was 38.5p. The range of prices during the year 
was 16.25p to 38.75p. As of the date of this report, there have been no changes in the interests of the directors in options over ordinary shares of the Company.
The emoluments of directors and their interests in executive options over shares in the Company and share based awards are the only auditable elements of the
remuneration report.
A resolution approving the remuneration report has been drafted and will be put to the shareholders at the AGM.
By order of the Board
