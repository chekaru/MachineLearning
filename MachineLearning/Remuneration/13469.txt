 REMUNERATION REPORT
18
ARC INTERNATIONAL PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
The emoluments of directors and their interests in executive options over shares in the Company and share-based awards are the only auditable elements of the remuneration
report.
REMUNERATION POLICY 
The principal function of the Remuneration Committee is to determine the remuneration packages of all executive directors and approve those of senior management. This includes
pension contributions, bonus payments, share options and service contracts. The Remuneration Committee prepares the Board's annual report to shareholders on the Group's policy
on remuneration of the executive director and the directors' remuneration report.
The members of the Remuneration Committee are Geoff Bristow and Richard Barfield. The Committee has two members as permitted under the Code of Corporate Governance
for smaller companies.
The Committee has access to outside professional advisers, generally appointed by the Committee or the Company Secretary in the furtherance of its duties and makes use of such
advice. The Company Secretary and HR Manager provided advice and services to the Committee.
The Company operates a remuneration policy for executive directors and senior management designed to ensure it attracts and retains the management skills necessary for it to
remain a leader in its field. The Committee believes that directors' and senior managers' total remuneration should seek to recognise their worth in the external market.
The policy on executive director and senior management remuneration and appointments is set out below.
POLICY ON REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE PERIODS
i) Company policy In determining the Company's policy on remuneration, the Remuneration Committee has regard to the following objectives:
a) Remuneration packages offered are designed to be competitive, being comparable with packages available within other groups operating in similar markets and on a similar
scale, including competitors.
b) Remuneration packages are fixed so as to attract, retain and motivate executives of the highest calibre, and at the same time optimise interests of shareholders. The Committee
takes into account that the Company is striving towards profitability when reviewing the monetary compensation that is awarded to directors and senior management.
ii) Basic salary In assessing the level of basic salary, the Remuneration Committee takes account of the pay practices of other companies, the responsibilities of each director and
senior manager, and pay awards elsewhere in the Group. Salaries are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
iii) Bonus payments Bonus payments are paid to executive directors, of up to 50% of base salary, and senior management, 25% of base salary, based on objectives, including
revenue, operating profit and cash flow targets, set for each individual. The Chief Executive Officer did not receive a bonus for 2005 (2004:  46,877).
iv) Share options Share option grants are a significant element of Company performance-related remuneration which align with the Group's achievement of its results. Share
options are awarded on the commencement of employment and are granted by the Remuneration Committee at the next available meeting. Each employee of the Company
participates in the executive share option programme and the Board considers this to be a significant employee motivator. The Committee reviews the number of share options that
directors and employees have been awarded and the exercise price to ensure that they remain effective. The grants to individual employees are limited under the scheme rules to
normal market practice of one times salary in any year (the exception being the grant made in connection with the recruitment of the new Chief Financial Officer which is two-
and-a-half times salary). The Company operates an Inland Revenue approved scheme that vests after three years, an unapproved scheme and an incentive stock option plan that
have a vesting schedule of 25% on the first anniversary and then monthly over 36 months.
v) Long-term incentive plans and interests of shareholders The Remuneration Committee reviews the level of option awards to ensure that they are consistent with the industry. 
It is the Board's intention to continue to grant share options to executive directors to reward them for their contribution towards the long-term profitability of the Company. 
The Remuneration Committee constantly reviews the use of performance criteria when awarding share options and restricted shares. The Committee feels that performance 
criteria should be used in some instances, notably with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, where there is an element with both performance criteria and without. 
The options granted to the directors are set out in the table on page 21. 19
ARC INTERNATIONAL PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
vi) Pensions Post-retirement benefits, which comprise only pensions, are based on contributions to a defined contribution scheme of up to 5% matched by the employee, paid into
a UK personal pension plan. The contribution is based on salary and bonus payments in line with market practice and Company policy for all UK employees, and is a standard
UK contract term. US employees participate in a 401k defined contribution pension plan that matches contributions up to 5% of salary.
vii) Duration and termination Mr Schlachte has an employment agreement with a six-month notice period. Non-executive directors have service agreements for a maximum
of three years with no contractual termination payments. Senior management have employment agreements with between three- and nine-months' notice periods.
Non-executive directors do not participate in the Company's executive share option scheme, long-term incentive plan or pension schemes. The Chairman has a share-based award
approved by the shareholders at the AGM on 21 July 2004.
Carl Schlachte is the only director with performance based remuneration (excluding share-based incentives) and if all targets are met, his remuneration would be split 66% non-
performance related and 34% performance related. All other directors have 100% non-performance related remuneration.
SERVICE AGREEMENTS
Carl Schlachte has a rolling  service contract which is terminable on six months' notice. This agreement provides for him to provide services to the Company on a full-time basis.
The agreement contains restrictive covenants for periods of 12 months post-employment relating to non-competition, non-solicitation of the Group's customers, suppliers and
employees and indefinitely with respect to confidential information and provides for the Group to own any intellectual property rights created by him in the course of his employment.
The Company allows Carl Schlachte to hold non-executive positions outside the Company, but he currently has none.
All the non-executive directors have service agreements as detailed.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' INTERESTS 
Details of individual directors' emoluments and interests in share options are shown in the tables on pages 20 and 21. For details of directors' shareholdings in the Company, 
please refer to the table in the directors' report on page 16. Non-executive directors' fees are arrived at by reference to fees paid by other companies of similar size and complexity
and reflect the amount of time non-executive directors are expected to devote to the Group's activities during the year. The non-executive directors have service contracts that set out
their terms of appointment. Their remuneration is set by the Board and comprises a fixed fee and variable element for time over and above that expected. The Chairman's fees for
2005 include those as detailed in the letter to the shareholders dated 7 June 2004. REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED

SHARE-BASED AWARDS
Dr van Cuylenburg and Mr Schlachte were awarded the following share-based awards in 2004:
Performance criteria based: cumulative new processor licence revenue Time based
3 September 3 March 3 September
Targets $3 million $7 million $12 million $18 million 2005 2006 2006
Dr van Cuylenburg - share-based award 156,250 156,250 156,250 156,250 125,000 125,000 125,000
Mr C Schlachte - restricted shares held in EBT 375,000 375,000 375,000 375,000 - - -
The Remuneration Committee determined that the $3 million target had been met and the first award was released on 10 August 2005. The time-based award vests if Dr van
Cuylenburg is a director of the Company on the date specified and the 3 September award was exercised on 12 September 2005. The market value of the shares at the award
date of 10 August 2005 for Mr Schlachte was 35.75p, a gain of  134,063 on 375,000 shares; for Dr van Cuylenburg on 10 August 2005 was 35.75p, a gain of
 55,859 on 156,250 shares and on 12 September 2005 was 36p, a gain of  45,000 on 125,000 shares. In February 2006, the Remuneration Committee determined that
the $7 million target had been met after a review of the Company's revenue from new processor licences. The Commttee will therefore recommend to the Trustees of the Employee
Benefit Trust that Mr Schlachte's restrictions be lifted and that Dr van Cuylenburg's award vest, as they relate to the second award. New processor licence revenue was chosen as
the performance criteria as it is believed that this is an indication of future growth of the Company.
The share-based awards give rise to a charge to the profit and loss account of  190,000 for 2005 (2004:   321,000). This is calculated taking the value of the award over
the expected period of benefit to the director. The benefit is calculated using the share price at the date of the award less any amounts payable by the director. The expected
period is based on an assessment of when the individual performance criteria will be reached or in the case of the non-performance award the period to each date. Each
performance criteria award is charged separately over its individual expected vesting period.
All executive share options are issued at market value. The market price of the Company's shares at the end of the year was 30.75p. The range of prices during the year was
28.50p to 42.50p. As of the date of this report, there have been no changes in the interests of the directors in options over ordinary shares of the Company.
A resolution approving the remuneration report has been drafted and will be put to the shareholders at the AGM.
By order of the Board
