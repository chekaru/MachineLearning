 The emoluments of directors and their interests in executive options over shares in the Company and share-based awards are the only auditable elements of the remuneration report.
Remuneration policy
The principal function of the Remuneration Committee is to determine the remuneration packages of all executive directors and approve those of senior management. This includes
base salaries, pension contributions, bonus payments, share-based incentives and service contracts. The Remuneration Committee prepares the Board's Annual Report to shareholders
on the Group's policy on remuneration of the executive directors and the directors' remuneration report.
The members of the Remuneration Committee are Geoff Bristow, Chairman, and Richard Barfield. The Committee has two members as permitted under the Code of Corporate
Governance for smaller companies.
The Committee has access to outside professional advisers, generally appointed by the Committee or the Company Secretary in the furtherance of its duties and makes use of such
advice. External advice has been obtained from New Bridge Street Consultants (who were appointed by the Committee and provide no other services to the Company) in respect
of share-based incentive plans, and how to ensure that any new plans fulfill the Committee's long-term incentive criteria.
The Company operates a remuneration policy for executive directors and senior management designed to ensure it attracts and retains the management skills necessary for it to
remain a leader in its field. The Committee believes that directors' and senior managers' total remuneration should seek to recognise their worth in the external market.
The policy on executive director and senior management remuneration and appointments is set out below.
Policy on remuneration of executive directors and senior management for current and future periods
i) Company policy In determining the Company's policy on remuneration, the Remuneration Committee has regard to the following objectives:
a) Remuneration packages offered are designed to be competitive, being comparable with packages available within other groups operating in similar markets (ie internationally)
and on a similar scale, including competitors.
b) Remuneration packages are set so as to attract, retain and motivate executives of the highest calibre, and at the same time optimise the interests of shareholders. The Committee
takes into account that the Company is striving towards profitability when reviewing the compensation that is awarded to directors and senior management.
ii) Basic salary In assessing the level of basic salary, the Remuneration Committee takes account of the pay practices of other companies, the responsibilities of each director and
senior manager, and pay awards elsewhere in the Group. Salaries are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee. During 2006 the annual salaries were reviewed in June
to take effect from 1 July, therefore a delay of three months from the usual effective date of 1 April. It is proposed to continue with the 1 July review date.
iii) Bonus payments Bonus payments are paid to executive directors, of up to 50% of base salary, and the senior management, of up to 25% of base salary, based on objectives,
including revenue, operating profit and cash flow targets, set for each individual. The Chief Executive Officer received a bonus for 2006 of $85,568 or 32% of base salary (2005: nil).
iv) Share options Share option grants are a significant element of Company performance-related remuneration. Share options are awarded on the commencement of employment
and are granted by the Remuneration Committee at the next available meeting. Each employee of the Company participates in the executive share option programme and the Board
considers this to be a significant employee motivator. The Committee reviews the number of share options that directors and employees have been awarded and the exercise price
to ensure that they remain effective. The grants to individual employees are limited under the scheme rules to normal market practice of one times salary in any year. The Company
operates an Inland Revenue approved scheme that vests after three years, an unapproved scheme and an incentive stock option plan that have a vesting schedule of 25% on the
first anniversary and then monthly over 36 months. The Company has a process whereby each year the level of share options outstanding for each employee is reviewed and where
necessary an evergreening  grant is made to ensure that they are still receiving the same incentive. The Company uses shares within the Employee Benefit Trust as well as potential
new issue shares to satisfy these grants.
v) Long-term incentive plans and interests of shareholders The Remuneration Committee reviews the level of option awards to ensure that they are consistent with the industry.
While it is the Board's intention to continue to grant share options to employees generally to reward them for their contribution towards the long-term profitability of the Company
the long-term incentive policy for the most senior executives (including executive directors) is under review. Shareholder approval for a new long-term incentive policy for these senior
executives will be sought as and when necessary. The Remuneration Committee constantly reviews the use of performance criteria when awarding share options and restricted shares.

14 ARC International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 15
The Committee has felt that performance criteria should be used in some instances, notably with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, where there is an element with both
performance criteria and without. The options granted to the directors are set out in the table on page 17.
vi) Pensions Post-retirement benefits, which comprise only pensions, are based on contributions to a defined contribution scheme of up to 5% matched by the employee, paid
into a UK personal pension plan. The contribution is based on salary and bonus payments in line with Company policy for all UK employees, and is a standard UK contract term.
US employees participate in a 401k defined contribution pension plan that matches contributions up to 5% of salary.
vii)Duration and termination Mr Schlachte has an employment agreement with a six-month notice period (further details of which are set out below). It is Company policy
for executive directors to have contracts with less than one year's notice period. There are no other termination payments. Non-executive directors have service agreements for
a maximum of three years with no contractual termination payments. These service agreements are being reviewed at present as the three-year period has expired. It is envisaged
that the new agreements will also contain no contractual termination payments. Senior management have employment agreements with between three- and nine-months'
notice periods.
Non-executive directors do not participate in the Company's executive share option scheme or pension schemes. The Chairman has a share-based award approved by the shareholders
at the AGM on 21 July 2004.
Carl Schlachte is the only director with performance-based remuneration (excluding share-based incentives) and if all targets are met, his remuneration would be split 66%
non-performance related and 34% performance related. All non-executive directors have 100% non-performance-related remuneration (save in respect of the Chairman's
share-based award).
Service agreements
Carl Schlachte has a rolling  service contract which is terminable on six months' notice. This agreement requires him to provide services to the Company on a full-time basis.
The agreement contains restrictive covenants for periods of 12 months' post-employment relating to non-competition, non-solicitation of the Group's customers, suppliers and
employees and indefinitely with respect to confidential information and provides for the Group to own any intellectual property rights created by him in the course of his
employment. The Company allows Carl Schlachte to hold non-executive positions outside the Company, and he is currently a non-executive director of Mosaid Inc a Canadian
quoted company. Mr Schlachte's expected earnings from this are $25,000 per annum and he is entitled to retain all the proceeds.
All the non-executive directors have service agreements as detailed below. As noted above the Company is currently agreeing new service contracts with the non-executive directors.

Service contracts are available for inspection at the registered office of the Company and will be available at the Annual General Meeting.
Non-executive directors' interests
Details of individual directors' emoluments and interests in share options are shown in the tables on pages 16 and 17. For details of directors' shareholdings in the Company, please
refer to the table in the directors' report on page 13. Non-executive directors' fees are arrived at by reference to fees paid by other companies of similar size and complexity and reflect
the amount of time non-executive directors are expected to devote to the Group's activities during the year. The non-executive directors have service contracts that set out their terms
of appointment. Their remuneration is set by the Board (with individual non-executive directors absenting themselves from discussions regarding their own remuneration) and
comprises a fixed fee and variable element for time over and above that expected. Share price performance

In the opinion of the directors, these indices are the most appropriate indices to measure the total shareholder return of the Company for these purposes because these indices
comprise similar companies to the Company.

Share-based awards
Dr van Cuylenburg and Mr Schlachte were awarded the following share-based awards in 2004:
Performance criteria based: cumulative new processor licence revenue Time based
3 September 3 March 3 September
Targets $3 million $7 million $12 million $18 million 2005 2006 2006
Dr van Cuylenburg - share-based award 156,250 156,250 156,250 156,250 125,000 125,000 125,000
Mr C Schlachte - restricted shares held in EBT 375,000 375,000 375,000 375,000 ---
New processor licence revenue was chosen as the performance criteria as the directors believed that this is an indication of future growth of the Company, and should also drive
revenue from future royalties and support fees.
During 2006 the following transactions occurred:
Date of Time based/ Market value Gain
exercise/release performance based Number of shares p 
Dr van Cuylenburg 17 March 2006 Time based 125,000 30 37,375
21 March 2006 Performance (2nd tranche) 156,250 30 46,718
15 September 2006 Time based 125,000 33 41,125
Mr C Schlachte 23 March 2006 Performance (2nd tranche) 375,000 30 112,500
3 November 2006 Performance (3rd tranche) 375,000 30 112,500
Under the terms of the award to Dr van Cuylenburg, the performance shares are exercisable when the Remuneration Committee have determined that the performance criteria have
been met based on audited revenue numbers. Therefore the third tranche is expected to be released to Dr van Cuylenburg after the signing of the audit report. Mr Schlachte was
awarded his third tranche based on a review of revenue by the directors.
As mentioned above the terms of the award to Dr van Cuylenburg are different to those of Mr Schlachte in terms of reference to audited revenue and also timing of the three-year
performance period. This performance period timing difference was, however, not what the directors had in mind when the awards were made. The directors had intended that
the award to the Chairman and the CEO would be aligned to ensure that they were both working to the same goals and therefore acting together in the interests of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee has therefore reviewed the terms of the agreements, and decided that a cash payment of  48,000 should be made to Dr van Cuylenburg, should
the last performance target be met, to bring him into alignment with Mr Schlachte. This takes into account revenue that has been recognised by the Group in the three-year period
equating to Mr Schlachte's performance period. The Remuneration Committee consider this to be an equitable solution which aligns the interests. The share-based awards give rise to a charge to the profit and loss account of  7,906 for 2006 (2005:  190,000). This is calculated taking the value of the award over the expected
period of benefit to the director. The benefit is calculated using the share price at the date of the award less any amounts payable by the director. The expected period is based on
an assessment of when the individual performance criteria will be reached or in the case of the non-performance award the period to each date. Each performance criteria award is
charged separately over its individual expected vesting period. No expense has been incurred for the fourth tranche of the award to Dr van Cuylenburg as the performance condition
was not met within the time frame as discussed above. The Company has accrued  45,333 during 2006 to cover the potential bonus payment.
All executive share options are issued at market value. The market price of the Company's shares at the end of the year was 33p. The range of prices during the year was 25.73p
to 34.25p. As of the date of this report, there have been no changes in the interests of the directors in options over ordinary shares of the Company.
