The emoluments of directors and their interests in executive
options over shares in the company and share-based awards

year were:
Steven Gunders (Chairman from 21 June 2007)
Richard Barfield
Geoff Bristow (Chairman until 21 June 2007)
All the members of the Committee are non-executive directors
and considered to be independent.
The principal function of the Remuneration Committee is to
determine the remuneration packages of all executive directors
and for monitoring the remuneration of senior management.
Thisincludesbasesalaries,pensioncontributions,bonuspayments,
share-based incentives and service contracts. The Remuneration
Committee prepares the Board's Annual Report to shareholders
on the group's policy on remuneration of the executive directors
and the directors' remuneration report.
The terms of reference are available on the group's website
www.ARC.com.
Advice provided to the Remuneration Committee
During the year, the following were appointed by the
Committee to provide advice that materially assisted
the Committee
New Bridge Street Consultants
Charles Rendell (Joint Company Secretary)
Thomas Huppuch ( Joint Company Secretary)
New Bridge Street Consultants were appointed by the Committee
(and provide no other services to the company) in respect of
share-based incentive plans, to ensure that any new plans fulfill
the Committee's long-term incentive criteria.
Remuneration policy
In determining the company's policy on remuneration, the
Remuneration Committee has regard to the following objectives:
i) Remuneration packages offered are designed to be
competitive, being comparable with packages available within
other groups operating in similar markets (ie internationally)
and on a similar scale, including competitors.
ii) Remuneration packages are set so as to attract, retain and
motivate executives of the highest calibre, and at the same time
optimise the interests of shareholders. The Committee takes into
account that the company is striving towards profitability when
reviewing the compensation that is awarded to directors and
senior management.
The policy is designed to provide a mix of performance and
non-performance remuneration so as to align their objectives
to those of the shareholders.
The policy on executive director and senior management
remuneration and appointments is set out below.
There have been no changes to policy from the preceding
year and no departures from this policy in the current year.
The current policy is expected to continue through the current
financial year.
Elements of the policy
i) Basic salary
In assessing the level of basic salary, the Remuneration
Committee takes account of the pay practices of other
companies, the responsibilities of each director and senior
manager, and pay awards elsewhere in the group. Salaries
are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
ii) Bonus payments
Bonus payments are paid to executive directors, of up to 50%
of base salary, and the senior management, of up to 25% of
base salary, based on objectives, including revenue, operating
profit and cash flow targets, set for each individual. The Chief
Executive Officer received a bonus for 2007 of $29,000 or
8.7% of base salary (2006: $85,568).
iii) Share options
Share option grants are a significant element of company
performance-related remuneration. Share options are awarded
on the commencement of employment and are granted by
the Remuneration Committee at the next available meeting.
Each employee of the company participates in the executive
share option programme and the Board considers this to be
a significant employee motivator. The Committee reviews the
number of share options that directors and employees have
been awarded and the exercise price to ensure that they remain
effective. The grants to individual employees are limited under
the scheme rules to normal market practice of one times salary
in any year. The company operates an Inland Revenue approved
scheme that vests after three years, an unapproved scheme and
an incentive stock option plan that have a vesting schedule of
25% on the first anniversary and then monthly over 36 months. Remuneration

External appointments
During the year, C Schlachte served as non-executive Chairman
of MOSAID Inc, a Canadian quoted company. Mr Schlachte
has retained all of the proceeds from this appointment,
US$66,650 (2006: $8,063).
Service agreements
None of the executive directors' service contracts have notice
periods of over one year in line with group policy.
Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period of
three years. It is group policy that they serve the three years
and are then offered for re-election by the shareholders.

There is no unexpired term for any of the directors listed above,
except for Steven Gunders who has 27 months from the date
of this report.
Service contracts are available for inspection at the registered
office of the company and will be available at the Annual
General Meeting.
Non-executive directors' interests
Non-executive directors do not participate in the company's
executive share option scheme or pension schemes.
P van Cuylenburg (Chairman until 3 April 2007) had
a share-based award approved by the shareholders
at the AGM on 21 July 2004.
Details of individual directors' emoluments and interests in share
options are shown in the tables on pages 25 and 26. For details
of directors' shareholdings in the company, please refer to the
table in the directors' report on page 20.
Non-executive directors' fees are arrived at by reference to
fees paid by other companies of similar size and complexity
and reflect the amount of time non-executive directors are
expected to devote to the group's activities during the year.
The non-executive directors have service contracts that set
out their terms of appointment. Their remuneration is set by
the Board (with individual non-executive directors absenting
themselves from discussions regarding their own remuneration)
and comprises a fixed fee.
The company has a process whereby each year the level of share
options outstanding for each employee is reviewed and where
necessary an evergreening  grant is made to ensure that they
are still receiving the same incentive. The company uses shares
within the Employee Benefit Trust as well as potential new issue
shares to satisfy these grants.
iv) Long-term incentive plans and interests
of shareholders
The Remuneration Committee reviews the level of option
awards to ensure that they are consistent with the industry.
At the AGM in 2007 the Committee proposed and the
shareholders approved, a new long-term incentive plan for
executive directors and senior management. The Committee
feels that this performance-driven plan will align directors'
performance remuneration with the interests of shareholders
generally. The grant to the directors under this policy
and the previous policy are set out in the tables on page 26.
v) Pensions
Post-retirement benefits, which comprise only pensions, are
based on contributions to a defined contribution scheme of
up to 5% matched by the employee, paid into a UK personal
pension plan. The contribution is based on salary and bonus
payments in line with company policy for all UK employees,
and is a standard UK contract term. US employees participate
in a 401k defined contribution pension plan that matches
contributions up to 5% of salary, with a maximum of $15,500.
vi) Duration and termination
It is company policy for executive directors to have contracts with
less than one year's notice period. There are no other termination
payments. Non-executive directors have service agreements for
a period of three years with no contractual termination payments.
Senior management have employment agreements with
between three- and nine-months' notice periods.
Performance/non performance pay ratios
If the total shareholder return growth under the long-term
incentive scheme is on target, and assuming that 100% of the
share options under the group's share options scheme will vest,
the composition of each executive director's remuneration will
be as follows:
Non-performance- Performance
related related LTIP and
basic salary bonus share options
C Schlachte 53% 27% 20%
V Young 63% 31% 6%
All non-executive directors have 100% non-performance-related
remuneration. Management and Governance

Long-term incentive plan (audited)
The long-term incentive plan, the performance share plan
(PSP ), was approved by shareholders at the AGM in
April 2007.
The Committee believes that a new long-term incentive policy
reflects current market and best practice and ensures that share-
based incentives are offered to the most senior executives in
as efficient a manner as possible from an accounting cost and
dilution perspective. The main features of the PSP are as follows:
Conditional awards over free shares are granted,
as opposed to market value options. This move away from
an option-focused incentive policy reflects recent emerging
trends in market and best practice.
In normal circumstances, awards over shares worth no more
than 125% of salary may be made each year. This limit
broadly reflects emerging market practice and allows the
Committee to offer competitive levels of performance-linked
long-term incentive awards.
All awards to executive directors will be subject to
challenging performance conditions. To ensure that the PSP
encourages the group's senior executives to generate above
market returns for its shareholders, initial awards will vest by
reference to the group's TSR performance over a three-year
period compared to the fully-listed Technology Hardware
and Equipment sector companies with current market
capitalisations no less than  20 million. No portion of an
award will vest if ARC is ranked below the median. If ARC
is ranked at the median 25% of an award will vest, with
full vesting if ARC is ranked at or above the upper quartile.
For the award during 2007 this group was made up of
the following companies:
Arm Holdings Filtronic
CSR Trafficmaster
Spirent Communications Zetex
Wolfson Microelectronics Danka Business Systems
Imagination Technologies
group CML Microsystems
Psion Plasmon
Vislink Northamber
On a change in control, the default  position is that awards
vest only subject to performance and a pro rata reduction.
Again, this approach accords with best practice.
It is currently intended that no executive director will receive
PSP awards and share option grants in the same year.
The charge to the income statement in respect of grants
under the Long Term Incentive Plan was  62,000.
Share options awarded to directors under the Long Term Incentive
Plan are:

The directors reviewed the new processor licence revenue for
the period covered by the share-based award and confirmed
that the target had been achieved. Therefore the fourth tranche
of the shares was released to Carl Schlachte. The directors
also authorised the payment of the bonus payment to Peter
van Cuylenburg as reported in last year's remuneration report.
The share-based awards give rise to a charge to the profit
and loss account of  2,964 for 2007 (2006:  7,906).
All executive share options are issued at market value.
The market price of the company's shares at the end of the
year was 34.5p. The range of prices during the year was
33.25p to 58.50p. As of the date of this report, there have
been no changes in the interests of the directors in options
over ordinary shares of the company.
A resolution approving the remuneration report has been
drafted and will be put to the shareholders at the AGM.

Share-based awards (audited)
Dr van Cuylenburg and Mr Schlachte were awarded the
following share-based awards in 2004:
Performance criteria based:
cumulative new processor licence revenue $3 million $7 million $12 million $18 million
P van Cuylenburg share-based award 156,250 156,250 156,250 156,250
C Schlachte restricted shares held in EBT 375,000 375,000 375,000 375,000
New processor licence revenue was chosen as the performance
criteria as the directors believed that this would be an indication
of future growth of the company, and should also drive revenue
from future royalties and support fees.
During the year the following transactions occurred:
