 The emoluments of directors and their interests in executive
options over shares in the company and share-based awards
are the only auditable elements of the remuneration report.
Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee during the
year were:
Steven Gunders (Chairman)
Richard Barfield
Geoff Bristow (Chairman until 22 April 2008)
All the members of the Committee are non-executive directors
and considered to be independent.
The principal function of the Remuneration Committee is to
determine the remuneration packages of all executive directors
and for monitoring the remuneration of senior management.
This includes base salaries, pension contributions, bonus
payments, share-based incentives and service contracts.
The Remuneration Committee prepares the Board's Annual
Report to shareholders on the group's policy on remuneration
of the executive directors and the directors' remuneration report.
The terms of reference are available on the group's website:

During the year, the following were appointed by the
Committee to provide advice that materially assisted
the Committee:
New Bridge Street Consultants
Charles Rendell (Joint Company Secretary)
Thomas Huppuch (Joint Company Secretary)
Sandy O'Gorman (Vice President Human Resources)

Committee (and provide no other services to the company)
in respect of share-based incentive plans, to ensure that any
new plans fulfil the Committee's long-term incentive criteria.
Remuneration policy
In determining the company's policy on remuneration, the
Remuneration Committee has regard to the following objectives:
i) Remuneration packages offered are designed to be
competitive, being comparable with packages available
within other groups operating in similar markets (i.e.
internationally) and on a similar scale, including competitors.
Remuneration
Report
Management and Governance
20 ARC International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
ii) Remuneration packages are set so as to attract, retain and
motivate executives of the highest calibre, and at the same
time optimise the interests of shareholders. The Committee
takes into account that the company is striving towards
profitability when reviewing the compensation that is
awarded to directors and senior management.
iii) Consideration of environmental, social and governance
issues. The board reviews the environmental impact of the
company as a whole, together with the social impact and the
governance issues. Currently there are no plans to incorporate
these into the bonus plans or the variable elements to the
remuneration packages. The Board will review this if the
position or operations of the group change.
The policy is designed to provide a mix of performance and
non-performance remuneration so as to align their objectives
to those of the shareholders. The remuneration mix for 2008
has changed with an increased emphasis on the performance
related pay. The percentage available by way of variable
measurable bonus has increased to reward increased performance.
The policy on executive director and senior management
remuneration and appointments is set out below.
There have been no changes to policy, other than an increased
emphasis on variable performance related pay, from the preceding
year and no departures from this policy in the current year. The current
policy is expected to continue through the current financial year.
Elements of the policy
i) Basic salary
In assessing the level of basic salary, the Remuneration Committee
takes account of the pay practices of other companies, the
responsibilities of each director and senior manager, and pay
awards elsewhere in the group. Salaries are reviewed annually
by the Remuneration Committee.
ii) Bonus payments
Bonus payments are paid to executive directors, of up to
75% (2007: 50%) of base salary, and the senior management,
of up to 55% (2007: 25%) of base salary, based on objectives,
including revenue, operating profit and cash flow targets, set
for each individual. The Chief Executive Officer received a bonus
for 2008 of $61,384 or 15.3% of base salary (2007: $29,000).
The bonus payment was for the first half performance.
iii) Share options
Share option grants are a significant element of company
performance-related remuneration. Share options are awarded
on the commencement of employment and are granted by the
Remuneration Committee at the next available meeting.
Employees of the company participates in the executive share
option programme, where appropriate, and the Board considers
this to be a significant employee motivator. The Committee
reviews the number of share options that directors and Management and Governance
21 ARC International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
employees have been awarded and the exercise price to ensure
that they remain effective. The grants to individual employees
are limited under the scheme rules to normal market practice
of one times salary in any year. The company operates an
Inland Revenue approved scheme that vests after three years,
an unapproved scheme and an incentive stock option plan that
have a vesting schedule of 25% on the first anniversary and
then monthly over 36 months. The company has a process
whereby each year the level of share options outstanding
for each employee is reviewed and where necessary an
evergreening  grant is made to ensure that they are still
receiving the same incentive. The company uses shares within
the Employee Benefit Trust as well as potential new issue shares
to satisfy these grants.
iv) Long-term incentive plans and interests of shareholders
The Remuneration Committee reviews the level of option awards
to ensure that they are consistent with the industry. At the AGM
in 2007 the Committee proposed and the shareholders approved,
a new long-term incentive plan for executive directors and senior
management. The Committee feels that this performance-driven
plan will align directors' performance remuneration with the
interests of shareholders generally. The grant to the directors
under this policy are set out in the table on page 24.
v) Pensions
Post-retirement benefits, which comprise only pensions, are
based on contributions to a defined contribution scheme of
up to 5% matched by the employee, paid into a UK personal
pension plan. The contribution is based on salary and bonus
payments in line with company policy for all UK employees,
and is a standard UK contract term. US employees participate
in a 401k defined contribution pension plan that matches
contributions up to 5% of salary, with a maximum of $15,500.
vi) Duration and termination
It is company policy for executive directors to have contracts with
less than one year's notice period. There are no other termination
payments. Non-executive directors have service agreements for
a period of three years with no contractual termination payments.
Senior management have employment agreements with between
three and nine months' notice periods.
Performance/non-performance pay ratios
If the total shareholder return growth under the long-term
incentive scheme is on target, and assuming that 100% of the
share options under the group's share options scheme will vest,
the composition of each executive director's remuneration will
be as follows:
Non-performance- Performance-
related related LTIP and
basic salary bonus share options
C Schlachte 80% 13% 7%
V Young 86% 9% 5%
All non-executive directors have 100% non-performance-related
remuneration.
External appointments
During the year, C Schlachte served as non-executive Chairman
of MOSAID Inc, a Canadian quoted company. Mr Schlachte has
retained all of the proceeds from this appointment, $90,939
(2007: $66,650).
Service agreements
None of the executive directors' service contracts have notice
periods of over one year in line with group policy.
Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period
of three years. It is group policy that they serve the three years
and are then offered for re-election by the shareholders.

except for Steven Gunders who has 15 months from the date
of this report.

office of the company and will be available at the Annual
General Meeting.
Non-executive directors' interests
Non-executive directors do not participate in the company's
executive share option scheme or pension schemes.
Details of individual directors' emoluments and interests in share
options are shown in the tables on pages 22 and 23. For details
of directors' shareholdings in the company, please refer to the
table in the directors' report on page 17.
Non-executive directors' fees are arrived at by reference to fees
paid by other companies of similar size and complexity and
reflect the amount of time non-executive directors are expected
to devote to the group's activities during the year. The non-
executive directors have service contracts that set out their terms
of appointment. Their remuneration is set by the Board (with
individual non-executive directors absenting themselves from
discussions regarding their own remuneration) and comprises
a fixed fee. Remuneration

Richard Barfield, Geoff Bristow and Steven Gunders have
no interest in executive options.
All executive share options are issued at market value. The
market price of the company's shares at the end of the year
was 11.75p. The range of prices during the year was 11.00p
to 34.50p. As of the date of this report, there have been no
changes in the interests of the directors in options over ordinary
shares of the company.
Long-term incentive plan (audited)
The long-term incentive plan, the performance share plan (PSP ),
was approved by shareholders at the AGM in April 2007.
The Committee believes that a new long-term incentive policy
reflects current market and best practice and ensures that share-
based incentives are offered to the most senior executives in
as efficient a manner as possible from an accounting cost and
dilution perspective. The main features of the PSP are as follows:
Conditional awards over free shares are granted, as opposed
to market value options. This move away from an option-
focused incentive policy reflects recent emerging trends
in market and best practice.
In normal circumstances, awards over shares worth no
more than 125% of salary may be made each year. This limit
broadly reflects emerging market practice and allows the
Committee to offer competitive levels of performance-linked
long-term incentive awards.
All awards to executive directors will be subject to challenging
performance conditions. To ensure that the PSP encourages
the group's senior executives to generate above market returns
for its shareholders, initial awards will vest by reference to the
group's TSR performance over a three-year period compared
to the fully-listed Technology Hardware and Equipment sector
companies with current market capitalisations no less than
 20 million. No portion of an award will vest if ARC is ranked
below the median. If ARC is ranked at the median 25% of an
award will vest, with full vesting if ARC is ranked at or above
the upper quartile. For the awards during 2008 this group
was made up of the following companies:
Arm Holdings Filtronic
CSR Trafficmaster
Spirent Communications Zetex
Wolfson Microelectronics Danka Business Systems
Imagination Technologies group CML Microsystems
Psion Plasmon
Vislink Northamber
On a change in control, the default  position is that awards
vest only subject to performance and a pro rata reduction.
Again, this approach accords with best practice.
It is currently intended that no executive director will receive
PSP awards and share option grants in the same year.
The charge to the income statement in respect of grants under
the Long Term Incentive Plan was  90,310 (2007:  62,000).
