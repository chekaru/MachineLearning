 Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Listing Rules
of the Financial Services Authority and the Directors' Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002. A resolution to approve this report will be
proposed to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in
September and is set out as resolution number three in the notice of
the meeting, which accompanies the Annual Report and Financial
Statements 2006.
Remuneration Policy
The Group's policy on directors' remuneration is to pay such
remuneration as to attract and retain the best staff in a manner
consistent with the Group's strategy and the goals of corporate
governance. In setting the Group's remuneration policy, the
Remuneration Committee considers a number of factors, including
the total remuneration available to Executive Directors of
comparable companies.
Remuneration Committee
The composition of the Remuneration Committee is shown on
page 21. 
The Remuneration Committee determines, on behalf of the Board,
the Group's policy for executive remuneration and the individual
remuneration packages for the Executive Directors including the grant
of share options. The Committee also has responsibility for
establishing policy for total compensation for all employees within the
Group including approving awards of share options. 
At the Committee's invitation or request, the Chief Executive
Officer may be in attendance at its meetings. The Company Secretary
provides administrative support to the Remuneration Committee. No
director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own
remuneration.
The Board supports the Executive Directors in taking up external
appointments where it enhances their contribution to the Company
and where they have sufficient time. All such appointments require
prior Board approval, and consideration is given to retention of
remuneration received from such appointments on a case-by-case
basis.
The Committee has access to professional advice, both inside and
outside the Group, as required.
report of the remuneration committee
24| ardana ANNUAL REPORT 2006 In the year to 31 March 2006 no material assistance was provided 
to the Remuneration Committee by third parties. 
Remuneration of Executive Directors
Consistent with the above policy, the remuneration packages
awarded to Executive Directors comprise a mix of
performance-related and non performance-related elements.
1. Base salary
Salaries are reviewed annually taking into account the
responsibilities and performance of each Director and his/her expected
future contribution. These are then benchmarked against remuneration
levels of directors in comparable companies within the sector. The
Committee aims to set base salaries for the Management Group close
to the median of base salaries for similar positions within other
pharmaceutical companies of a similar size.
2. Annual performance incentive
The Group operates a discretionary bonus scheme of up to 20% of
base salary. Such bonuses are dependent upon performance, which is
measured against individual and corporate objectives set at 
the beginning of the year. In 2006, 10% of the performance-linked
remuneration was assessed on overall measures of Group performance.
The balance was based on individual job-specific assessments. 
The remuneration policy is not expected to change in 2007. 
3. Longer term incentives
a) Share options
Share options have been granted to employees and Executive
Directors to reward past performance. The exercise prices for these
share options and details of all share options outstanding at 31
March 2006 are given in note 16 to the financial statements. Share
options held by Executive Directors are subject to the rules of the Ardana
Bioscience Employees' Share Option Scheme, the Ardana Limited
Employees' Share Option Scheme and the Ardana plc Executive Share
Option Scheme. All options expire after ten years from the date of
grant. The award of share options is at the discretion of the
Remuneration Committee. 
Share options granted to Directors since March 2004 have been
subject to a performance based condition. The performance criteria
are based on a combination of Group and individual performance
versus the objectives set for the past year. Group performance and
Executive Director individual performance are assessed and agreed
by the Remuneration Committee via the annual appraisal process;
individual employee performance ratings are agreed by
management. These performance ratings are then applied to the
available pool of shares under option set by the Board for the year.
Full details of Directors' share options are on page 30.
ardana ANNUAL REPORT 2006 | 25 b) Pensions and other benefits
The Group operates a stakeholder pension scheme but makes no
contributions nor has any other obligations to any pension schemes
on behalf of the Executive Directors (2005:  nil). 
Benefits, detailed in the table of Directors' Remuneration set out
on page 28, comprise healthcare insurance and relocation expenses
on joining.
Directors' Service Contracts
The service contracts for the two Executive Directors were entered
into on 4 March 2005 and include the following remuneration-related
provisions:
are not of fixed-term duration;
are subject to 12 months' notice by either party. The Group is entitled
to pay a sum in lieu of notice equivalent to the basic salary plus
benefits that would have been earned during the notice period; and 
do not provide for further compensation payable upon early
termination.
Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts.

Non-executive Directors
Remuneration of Non-executive Directors is determined by the
Executive Directors and ratified by the Board. Terms of service are
specified in letters of appointment. Currently appointments are for a
period of two years, which may be renewed, and are subject to one
month's notice. Non-executive Directors do not receive pension
contributions or a bonus.
Prior to March 2005, Non-executive Directors participated in the
Company's share option schemes. From March 2005 onwards, the
Non-executive Directors have not been granted or exercised share
options under the Company's share option schemes.
Non-executive Directors' appointments may be renewed by
mutual agreement. As recommended by Combined Code provision
A.7.2, any term beyond nine years for a Non-executive Director is
subject to rigorous review. The Group's policy on renewal after six years
is to extend one year at a time.
Terms and Conditions for the Non-executive Directors are
available at the Company's registered office.
Senior Management Personnel
The remuneration packages of Senior Management personnel
comprise the following elements:
base salary;
annual performance incentive;
healthcare insurance; and
share options.
Share options are granted to Senior Management personnel to
reward past performance. 28| ardana ANNUAL REPORT 2006
