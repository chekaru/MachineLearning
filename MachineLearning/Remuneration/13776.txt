Annual Report 2003
Remuneration report
As well as complying with the provisions of the Combined Code
as disclosed in the Corporate Governance Statement, the
company has applied the principles relating to directors'
remuneration as described below.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of M J Barnes
(Chairman), A H Parker Bowles, G T Parr and R D Withers. 
The Committee determines the remuneration of all directors 
and of certain other senior executives within the company.
Remuneration policy
The company's remuneration policy is to pay individual 
directors a salary or fee at market levels for comparable jobs,
recognising the size of the company and the business sector 
in which it operates.
The following comprised the principal elements of executive
directors' remuneration:
  Basic salary and benefits.
  Annual bonus.
  Long-term incentives.
  Pension contributions into a defined contribution 
pension scheme.
It is group policy to ensure that there is a strong link between 
the level of directors' remuneration and performance of the
group. Consequently only basic salaries and benefits are fixed.
These fixed elements are recognised as being comparable with
other companies. The Remuneration Committee recognises that
the long-term success of the group is largely dependent on
attracting executives of the highest quality. Therefore each
director can significantly augment their salary through annual
bonuses and long-term incentives. The group's contributions to 
a defined contribution pension scheme are based on basic salary
levels only.
In addition to the statutory vote to be held on this Remuneration
report, shareholders will be given the opportunity to ask the
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, M J Barnes,
questions on any aspect of the group's remuneration policy.
The remuneration for non-executive directors consists of salary
or fees for their services in connection with the board and board
Committee meetings. They are not eligible for pension scheme
membership. Their fees are determined by the executive
directors who have regard to the level of salary or fees paid 
to the non-executives of similar companies.
Each element of remuneration payable to executive directors 
is discussed in more detail below.
Basic salary and benefits
Basic salaries for all executive directors are reviewed (but not
necessarily increased) annually by the Committee. In determining
the level of basic salaries, the Committee will give consideration
to the government's published inflation statistics, salaries for
comparable positions and any significant change in the role
performed by the director. The Committee also makes use of
external remuneration consultants.
In addition to basic salaries, each executive director is entitled 
to the following main benefits:
  25 working days' holiday per annum in addition to normal 
bank and public holidays.
  A fully expensed company car or cash equivalent.
  Permanent health insurance for themselves, their spouse 
and children.
Annual bonus
In addition to basic salary, each executive director is entitled 
to an annual performance related bonus of up to 50% of basic
salary . Specific performance criteria are set by the Committee at
the commencement of the year following approval of the group's
budgets and are primarily related to financial performance but
will include an element of discretionary bonus for exceptional
work during the year under review. 28 Arena Leisure Plc

Service contracts
The Remuneration Committee has adopted the following policies concerning contracts and service periods which will be applied 
to any future appointment to the board:
  The notice period required by the company to terminate contracts is 12 months for executive directors.
  If the company terminates without notice the individual is entitled to a payment in lieu of notice of up to 12 months' pay. 
  In the event of termination for reasons of misconduct, no payment in lieu of notice is payable.
  Executive directors will be employed under normal contracts of employment, but are required to give the company 12 months' notice
of their intention to leave.
  Non-executive directors are required to give three months' notice under the terms of their service contracts. Details of each director's
contract are shown below.
Director Date of contract Unexpired term Notice period

I C Hogg 21 December 1999 n/a 1 year

A H Parker Bowles 8 September 1999 n/a 3 months

Long-term incentives - share options
It is the policy of the group to grant share options to directors and
other key employees as a method of performance incentive in line
with our objective to improve shareholder value. The Committee
believes that share ownership and the granting of options
strengthens the link between executives' personal interests
and those of the shareholders. Specific performance criteria are
linked to the exercise of options based upon growth in the share
price. The grant of share options is at the discretion of the board.
There were no new options granted in the year under review.
Pension policy 
Each of the executive directors is entitled to participate in 
the group's defined contribution pension scheme to which the
company will contribute 8% of basic salary . The pension scheme
provides life insurance cover equal to four times basic salary .
Performance graph
The following graph compares the total return on the company's
shares with that of the FTSE All-Share total return index over
the last five years. The reasons the company has chosen this
particular index are:
  It is considered the most likely benchmark by which 
the majority of shareholders would want to assess 
their investment in a public company.
  It is generally less volatile over time than other 
market indices.

All performance criteria in respect of the above options have been met, with the exception of 1,200,000 options allocated to
I R Penrose on 24 May 2001 and 925,000 options allocated to I C Hogg also on 24 May 2001. The share price performance target
required to enable the exercise of these options has yet to be achieved. The 1,200,000 options issued to I R Penrose are exercisable
if the mean closing mid-price of an ordinary share of 5 pence each over a continuous period of 30 days is at least 154 pence. The
performance criteria applying to the 925,000 share options issued to I C Hogg are subject to the same performance criteria.
No options were granted during the year. The market price of the shares at 31 December 2003 was 40.5 pence. High and low prices
were 48 pence and 18.25 pence respectively over the period.
