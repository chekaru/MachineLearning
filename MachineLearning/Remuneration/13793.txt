 Arena Leisure Plc Annual Report 2004 31
Remuneration report
As well as complying with the provisions of the new Combined
Code as disclosed in the Corporate Governance Statement, the
company has applied the principles relating to directors'
remuneration as described below.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of M J Barnes (Chairman),
A H Parker Bowles and R D Withers. The Committee determines
the remuneration of all directors and of certain other senior
executives within the company.
Remuneration policy
The company's remuneration policy is to pay individual 
directors a salary or fee at market levels for comparable jobs,
recognising the size of the company and the business sector 
in which it operates.
The following comprised the principal elements of executive
directors' remuneration:
  Basic salary and benefits.
  Annual bonus.
  Long-term incentives.
  Pension contributions into a defined contribution 
pension scheme.
It is group policy to ensure that there is a strong link between 
the level of directors' remuneration and performance of the
group. Consequently only basic salaries and benefits are fixed.
These fixed elements are recognised as being comparable with
other companies. The Remuneration Committee recognises that
the long-term success of the group is largely dependent on
attracting executives of the highest quality. Therefore each
director can significantly augment their salary through annual
bonuses and long-term incentives. The group's contributions to 
a defined contribution pension scheme are based on basic salary
levels only.
In addition to the statutory vote to be held on this Remuneration
report, shareholders will be given the opportunity to ask the
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, M J Barnes,
questions on any aspect of the group's remuneration policy.
The remuneration for non-executive directors consists of salary
or fees for their services in connection with the board and board
Committee meetings. They are not eligible for pension scheme
membership. Their fees are determined by the executive
directors who have regard to the level of salary or fees paid 
to the non-executives of similar companies.
Each element of remuneration payable to executive directors 
is discussed in more detail below.
Basic salary and benefits
Basic salaries for all executive directors are reviewed (but not
necessarily increased) annually by the Committee. In determining
the level of basic salaries, the Committee will give consideration
to the government's published inflation statistics, salaries for
comparable positions and any significant change in the role
performed by the director. The Committee also makes use of
external remuneration consultants.
In addition to basic salaries, each executive director is entitled 
to the following main benefits:
  25 working days' holiday per annum in addition to normal 
bank and public holidays.
  A fully expensed company car or cash equivalent.
  Permanent health insurance for themselves, their spouse 
and children.
Annual bonus
In addition to a basic salary, the Chief Executive Director is
entitled to an annual performance related bonus of up to 60% 
of basic salary and other executive directors of up to 50% of basic
salary . Specific performance criteria are set by the Committee at
the commencement of the year following approval of the group's
budgets and are primarily related to defined strategic and
financial objectives of the group.
Long-term incentives - share options
The Committee believes that share ownership and the granting
of options strengthens the link between executives' personal
interests and those of the shareholders. Specific performance
criteria are linked to the exercise of options based upon growth 
in the share price. The grant of share options is at the discretion
of the board. No new options have been issued since 2001.
Pension policy 
Each of the executive directors is entitled to participate in 
the group's defined contribution pension scheme to which the
company will contribute 8% of basic salary . The pension scheme
provides life insurance cover equal to four times basic salary .
Performance graph
The following graph compares the total return on the company's
shares with that of the FTSE All-Share total return index over
the last five years. The reasons the company has chosen this
particular index are that it is considered the most likely
benchmark by which the majority of shareholders would 
want to assess their investment in a public company and it 
is generally less volatile over time than other market indices. 
The board does not however consider that the total shareholder
return index as presented below properly reflects the true
underlying performance of the group over the five year period.
This is due to a major spike in the company's share price at the
start of the period and throughout the year 2000. This followed 
as a consequence of the internet  boom' which inflated the
company's share price at this point.
