 Arena Leisure Plc Annual Report 2005 31
Remuneration report
As well as complying with the provisions of the new Combined Code
as disclosed in the Corporate Governance Statement, the company
has applied the principles relating to directors' remuneration as
described below .
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of H R Mould (Chairman) who
was appointed on 1 November 2005, A H Parker Bowles and R D Withers.
M J Barnes served as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee until
his resignation on 31 October 2005.The Committee determines the
remuneration of all directors and of certain other senior executives
within the company .
Remuneration policy
The company's remuneration policy is to pay individual directors 
a salary or fee at market levels for comparable jobs, recognising the
size of the company and the business sector in which it operates.
The following comprised the principal elements of executive
directors' remuneration:
  Basic salary and benefits.
  Annual bonus.
  Long-term incentives.
  Pension contributions into a defined contribution
pension scheme.
It is group policy to ensure that there is a strong link between the 
level of directors' remuneration and performance of the group.
Consequently only basic salaries and benefits are fixed. These fixed
elements are recognised as being comparable with other companies.
The Remuneration Committee recognises that the long-term success
of the group is largely dependent on attracting executives of the
highest quality . Therefore each director can significantly augment
their salary through annual bonuses and long-term incentives. The
group's contributions to a defined contribution pension scheme are
based on basic salary levels only .
In addition to the statutory vote to be held on this Remuneration report,
shareholders will be given the opportunity to ask the Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee, HR Mould, questions on any aspect 
of the group's remuneration policy .
The remuneration for non-executive directors consists of salary 
or fees for their services in connection with the board and board
Committee meetings. They are not eligible for pension scheme
membership. Their fees are determined by the executive directors
who have regard to the level of salary or fees paid to the non-
executives of similar companies.
Each element of remuneration payable to executive directors is
discussed in more detail below .
Basic salary and benefits
Basic salaries for all executive directors are reviewed (but not
necessarily increased) annually by the Committee. In determining 
the level of basic salaries, the Committee will give consideration 
to the government's published inflation statistics, salaries for
comparable positions and any significant change in the role
performed by the director. The Committee also makes use of 
external remuneration consultants.
In addition to basic salaries, each executive director is entitled to the
following main benefits:
  Chief Executive - 29 working days' holiday per annum in addition to
normal bank and public holidays. Other executives - 25 working days
holiday per annum in addition to normal bank and public holidays
  A fully expensed company car or cash equivalent.
  Private health insurance for themselves, their spouse and children.
Annual bonus
In addition to a basic salary , the Chief Executive is entitled to an annual
performance related bonus of up to 60% of basic salary and other
executive directors of up to 50% of basic salary . Specific performance
criteria are set by the Committee at the commencement of the year
following approval of the group's budgets and are primarily related 
to defined strategic and financial objectives of the group.
Long-term incentives - share options
The Committee believes that share ownership and the granting 
of options strengthens the link between executives' personal 
interests and those of the shareholders. Specific performance 
criteria are linked to the exercise of options based upon growth 
in the share price. The grant of share options is at the discretion 
of the board. On 3 October 2005 MJ Elliott was granted options 
over 1,000,000 shares in the company .
Pension policy
Each of the executive directors is entitled to participate in the 
group's defined contribution pension scheme to which the company
will contribute 8% of basic salary . The pension scheme provides 
life insurance cover equal to four times basic salary .
Performance graph
The following graph compares the total return on the company's
shares with that of the FTSE All-Share total return index over the last
five years. The reasons the company has chosen this particular index
are that it is considered the most likely benchmark by which the
majority of shareholders would want to assess their investment in 
a public company and it is generally less volatile over time than 
other market indices.
The board does not however consider that the total shareholder 
return index as presented below properly reflects the true underlying
performance of the group over the five-year period. This is due to 
the effect of the market  boom' and subsequent decline in internet-
related stocks which impacted upon the company share price. This
was still evident at 31 December 2000, being the base point of the 
five-year index.
