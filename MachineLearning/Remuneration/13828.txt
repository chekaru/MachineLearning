 Basic salary and benefits
Basic salaries for all executive directors are reviewed (but not necessarily
increased) annually by the Committee. In determining the level of basic
salaries, the Committee will give consideration to the Government' s
published inflation statistics, salaries for comparable positions in similar
sized companies and any significant change in the role performed by the
director. The Committee also makes use of benchmark data provided by
external remuneration consultants but is mindful of the potential
ratcheting effect that such data can result in.
In addition to basic salaries, each executive director is entitled to the
following main benefits:
  Chief Executive - 29 working days' holiday per annum in addition to
normal bank and public holidays. Other executives - 25 working days
holiday per annum in addition to normal bank and public holidays.
  A fully expensed company car or cash equivalent.
  Private health insurance for themselves, their spouse and children.
Annual bonus
In addition to a basic salary, the executive directors are entitled to an
annual performance related bonus.
The maximum bonus potential of the Chief Executive was increased part
way through the financial year under review from 60% of salary to 100%
of salary and the maximum bonus potential will be increased for the
Racing Director with effect from 1 January 2007 from 50% of salary to
60% of salary.
The Chief Executive' s annual bonus opportunity was increased during the
year to take account of:
  An interim review of his excellent performance nine months after
appointment (i.e. some time after the publication of the last Annual
Report & Accounts);
  The Remuneration Committee' s desire to introduce a more performance
related culture; and
  General movements in market practice where annual bonus
opportunities have increased significantly.
The Racing Director' s bonus is also being increased to reflect the move to
a more performance related culture and general wider market practice.
Specific performance criteria are set by the Remuneration Committee at
the commencement of the year following approval of the group' s budgets
and are primarily related to defined strategic and financial objectives of the
group. The bonus payments that relate to the year under review were
91% of salary for the Chief Executive and 45% for the Racing Director,
reflecting the success enjoyed by Arena in the year.
Long-term incentives
Share options
The Committee believes that share ownership and the granting of options
strengthens the link between executives' personal interests and those of
the shareholders.
During the year under review, final grants of share options were made to
the executive directors under the Arena Leisure Discretionary Share

Arena Leisure Plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2006
As well as complying with the provisions of the Combined Code, as
disclosed in the Corporate Governance statement, the company has
applied the principles relating to directors' remuneration as described
below.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of H R Mould (Chairman), 
A H Parker Bowles and M McGann (appointed 27 June 2006). 
R D Withers served on the Remuneration Committee until his resignation
on 8 May 2006. The Committee determines the remuneration of the
executive directors and certain other senior executives within the
company. The Committee also determines the Chairman' s fee. The Chief
Executive may, at the Committee' s invitation, attend meetings except
where his own remuneration is discussed.
During the year the Remuneration Committee appointed independent
remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP ( NBSC'),
to advise on all aspects of senior executive remuneration. NBSC has no
other connection with the company other than in the provision of advice
on executive and employee remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The company' s remuneration policy is to pay individual directors a salary
or fee at market levels for comparable jobs, recognising the size of the
company and the business sector in which it operates.
The following comprised the principal elements of executive directors'
remuneration:
  Basic salary and benefits.
  Annual bonus.
  Long-term incentives.
  Pension contributions into a defined contribution pension scheme.
It is group policy to ensure that there is a strong link between the level of
directors' remuneration and performance of the group. Consequently only
basic salaries and benefits are fixed. These fixed elements are recognised
as being comparable with other companies. The Remuneration
Committee recognises that the long-term success of the group is largely
dependent on attracting executives of the highest quality. Therefore each
director can significantly augment their salary through annual bonuses
and long-term incentives. The group' s contributions to a defined
contribution pension scheme are based on basic salary levels only.
In addition to the statutory vote to be held on this Remuneration report,
shareholders will be given the opportunity to ask the Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee, H R Mould, questions on any aspect of the
group' s remuneration policy at the 2007 Annual General Meeting.
The remuneration for non-executive directors consists of salary or fees 
for their services in connection with the board and board committee
meetings. They are not eligible for pension scheme membership. Their
fees are determined by the executive directors who have regard to the
level of salary or fees paid to the non-executives of similar companies and
the time commitment required of each non-executive director.
Each element of remuneration payable to executive directors is discussed
in more detail below. Option Scheme which is due to expire in June 2007. The performance
conditions that applied to these grants are set out below:
Vesting
percentage of the
Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth shares granted
Less than RPI + 3% p.a. 0%
RPI + 3% p.a. 30%
RPI + 10% p.a. 100%
Between 3% p.a. and 10% p.a. 30% - 100% pro rata
Awards subject to these performance conditions were made on 
31 October 2006 with M J Elliott granted options over 1,392,405 shares
in the company and R I Renton granted options over 746,835 shares in
the company. Adjusted earnings per share ( EPS') in relation to these
options refers to the normalised earnings per share of the company
as defined by the Remuneration Committee from time to time.
Proposed long-term incentive plan
With the share option scheme due to expire in June 2007, the Committee
undertook a full review of the long-term incentive policy during the year.
The review considered the specific stage of development of the company
and current trends in long-term incentive practices for companies of a
comparable size. The result is that shareholder approval is being sought
for a new long-term incentive plan ( LTIP'). The LTIP will provide for annual
conditional awards of shares to be made subject to the achievement of
challenging performance conditions. The key features are set out below
with a full summary contained in the Appendix to the Notice of Meeting 
on pages 71 to 73.
Maximum award level
The normal maximum annual award will be set at 100% of base salary. 
In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or retention, awards
may be made up to 200% of base salary.
Performance conditions
For the initial awards to be made in 2007, the performance condition will
be structured using absolute adjusted EPS growth targets. This approach
is being proposed because it enables the condition to be tailored to the
specific circumstances of the company at this time and its prospects for
the next three year period.
Vesting
percentage of the
Absolute adjusted EPS for the shares subject
financial year ending 31 December 2009 to award
Less than 2.2p 0%
2.2p 25%
3.0p 75%
3.3p 100%
Straight line vesting occurs between 25% to 75% and 75% to 100%
For awards in future years (i.e. awards made following the announcement
of the company' s results for the financial year ending 31 December 2007)
the performance conditions will revert to adjusted EPS growth in excess
of inflation ( RPI') targets, over the performance period. This approach is
in line with general market practice.
Vesting
percentage of the
Adjusted EPS growth over the three shares subject
year performance period to an award
Less than RPI + 12% 0%
RPI + 12% 25%
RPI + 30% 100%
Between RPI +12% Straight-line vesting occurs
and RPI +30% between 25% and 100%
The Committee will reserve the right to adjust the conditions set out for
awards made in 2008 (and beyond) to better reflect the stage of
development that the company has reached at the relevant time.
The Committee' s current intention is that awards would normally be made
on an annual basis under the LTIP to encourage sustained earnings
growth. This policy would replace the ad-hoc award policy that the
company has previously operated.
Earnings per share growth has been chosen as the performance measure
because it is a key measure of internal financial performance.
Arena' s major shareholders were consulted in advance of finalising the
design of the proposed LTIP .
Pension policy
Each of the executive directors is entitled to participate in the group' s
defined contribution pension scheme to which the company will
contribute 8% of basic salary. The pension scheme provides life insurance
cover equal to four times basic salary.
Performance graph
The following graph compares the total return on the company' s shares
with that of the FTSE All-Share total return index over the last five years.
The reasons the company has chosen this particular index are that it is
considered the most likely benchmark by which the majority of
shareholders would want to assess their investment in a public company
and it is generally less volatile over time than other market indices.
