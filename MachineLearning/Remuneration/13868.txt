 Remuneration Report
Arena Leisure Plc I 25
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
As well as complying with the provisions of the Combined 
Code as disclosed in the Corporate Governance Statement, 
the Company has applied the principles relating to Directors'
remuneration as described below.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of Andrew Parker
Bowles (appointed as Chairman on 28 April 2008), Raymond
Mould (resigned as Chairman on 28 April 2008), Andrew 
Page (appointed 1 December 2008) and Martin McGann
(resigned 31 December 2008). The Committee determines 
the remuneration of the Executive Directors and of certain 
other senior executives within the Company. The Committee
also determines the Chairman's fee. The Chief Executive may, 
at the Committee's invitation, attend meetings except when 
his own remuneration is discussed.
In 2006, the Remuneration Committee appointed independent
remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP
( NBSC'), to advise on all aspects of senior executive remuneration.
NBSC continues to act as consultant to the Company and has no
other connection with the Company other than in the provision
of advice on executive and employee remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The Company's remuneration policy is to pay individual
Directors a salary or fee at market levels for comparable jobs,
recognising the size of the Company and the business sector 
in which it operates.
The following comprised the principal elements of Executive
Directors' remuneration:
  Basic salary and benefits;
  Annual bonus;
  Long-term incentives; and
  Pension contributions into a defined contribution 
pension scheme.
It is Group policy to ensure that there is a strong link between
the level of Directors' remuneration and performance of the
Group. Consequently, only basic salaries and benefits are fixed.
These fixed elements are recognised as being comparable with
other companies. The Remuneration Committee recognises 
that the long-term success of the Group is largely dependent 
on attracting executives of the highest quality. Therefore, each
Director can significantly augment their salary through annual
bonuses and long-term incentives. The Group's contributions 
to a defined contribution pension scheme are based on basic
salary levels only.
In addition to the statutory vote to be held on this Remuneration
Report, shareholders will be given the opportunity to ask the
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, Andrew Parker
Bowles, questions on any aspect of the Group's remuneration
policy at the 2009 Annual General Meeting.
The remuneration for Non-Executive Directors consists of salary
or fees for their services in connection with the Board and Board
Committee meetings. They are not eligible for pension scheme
membership. Their fees are determined by the Executive Directors
who have regard to the level of salary or fees paid to the non-
executives of similar companies and the time commitment
required of each Non-Executive Director .
Each element of remuneration payable to Executive Directors 
is discussed in more detail below.
Basic salary and benefits
Basic salaries for all Executive Directors are reviewed 
(but not necessarily increased) annually by the Committee. In
determining the level of basic salaries, the Committee will give
consideration to the Government's published inflation statistics,
salaries for comparable positions in similar sized companies
and any significant change in the role performed by the Director .
The Committee also makes use of benchmark data provided 
by external remuneration consultants but is mindful of the
potential ratcheting effect that such data can produce.
In addition to basic salaries, each Executive Director is entitled
to the following main benefits:
  In addition to normal bank and public holidays: 
Chief Executive - 29 working days' holiday per annum, 
Finance Director - 26 working days' holiday per annum and
Racing Director - 25 working days' holiday per annum;
  A fully expensed company car or cash equivalent; and
  Private health insurance for themselves, their spouse 
and children.
Annual bonus
In addition to a basic salary, the Executive Directors are entitled
to an annual performance-related bonus.
The maximum bonus potential of the Chief Executive is 100% 
of salary, the Finance Director is 60% of salary and the Racing
Director is 60% of salary. 
Specific performance criteria are set by the Remuneration
Committee at the commencement of the year following 
approval of the Group's budgets and are primarily related 
to defined strategic and financial objectives of the Group. 
The bonus payments that relate to the year under review 
were 18% of salary for the Chief Executive, 10% of salary 
for the Finance Director and 12% for the Racing Director .
Long-term incentives
The Committee believes that share ownership and the granting
of share awards strengthens the link between executives'
personal interests and those of shareholders.

Share options
In October 2006, final grants of share options were made to 
the Executive Directors under the Arena Leisure Discretionary
Share Option Scheme, which expired in June 2007. 
Long-term incentive plan
With the expiration of the share option scheme in June 2007,
shareholder approval was obtained for a new long-term
incentive plan ( LTIP') at the 2007 Annual General Meeting. The
LTIP provides for annual conditional awards of equity-settled
shares to be made subject to the achievement of challenging
performance conditions. The key features are set out below.
Maximum award level
The normal maximum annual award is set at 100% of base
salary. In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment 
or retention, awards may be made up to 200% of base salary.
The annual LTIP award can be replaced by an additional
performance-related bonus of up to a maximum of 50% 
of the normal annual bonus award.
Performance conditions
For the initial awards made in 2007, the performance conditions
were structured using absolute adjusted earnings per share
( EPS') growth targets. This approach enabled the conditions 
to be tailored to the specific circumstances of the Company 
at the time and its prospects for the next three-year period. 
The performance conditions that applied to these awards are 
set out below:
Absolute adjusted EPS for the financial year ending Vesting percentage of the 
31 December 2009 shares subject to award
Less than 2.2p 0%
2.2p 25%
3.0p 75%
3.3p 100%
Straight-line vesting occurs between 25% to 75% and 75% to 100%
For the purposes of the initial awards, as well as for awards
made in future years, adjusted EPS is defined as basic EPS
adjusted for certain one-off events.
For awards made in 2008 and future years the performance
conditions have reverted to adjusted EPS growth in excess 
of inflation ( RPI') targets over the performance period, as 
set out below:
Adjusted EPS growth over Vesting percentage of the
the three-year performance period shares subject to award
Less than RPI + 12% 0%
RPI + 12% 25%
RPI + 30% 100%
Between RPI + 12% Straight-line vesting occurs
and RPI + 30% between 25% and 100%
The Committee's current intention is that awards will normally
be made on an annual basis under the LTIP to encourage
sustained earnings growth. This policy replaces the ad hoc
award policy that the Company previously operated.
Pension policy
Each of the Executive Directors is entitled to participate in 
the Group's defined contribution pension scheme to which 
the Company will contribute 8% of basic salary. The pension
scheme provides life insurance cover equal to four times 
basic salary.
Performance graph
The following graph compares the total return on the 
Company's shares with that of the FTSE Small Cap total 
return index over the last five years. The reasons the Company
has chosen this particular index are that it is considered the
most likely benchmark by which the majority of shareholders
would want to assess their investment in Arena and it is
generally less volatile over time than other market indices.
