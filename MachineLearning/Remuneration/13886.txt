 Remuneration Report
Governance
Arena Leisure Plc | 29
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
As well as complying with the provisions of the Combined
Code as disclosed in the Corporate Governance Statement,
the Company has applied the principles relating to Directors'
remuneration as described below.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of Andrew Parker
Bowles (Chairman), Raymond Mould and Andrew Page. The
Committee determines the remuneration of the Executive
Directors and of certain other senior executives within the
Company. The Committee also determines the Chairman's fee:
the Chairman does not participate in discussions of his own fee.
The Chief Executive may, at the Committee's invitation, attend
meetings except when his own remuneration is discussed.
The Remuneration Committee has appointed independent
remuneration consultants, Hewitt New Bridge Street
( HNBS'), to advise on all aspects of senior executive
remuneration. HNBS continues to act as consultant to the
Company and has no other connection with the Company
other than in the provision of advice on executive and
employee remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The Company's remuneration policy is to pay individual
Directors a salary or fee at market levels for comparable
jobs, recognising the size of the Company and the business
sector in which it operates.
The following comprised the principal elements of Executive
Directors' remuneration:
  Basic salary and benefits;
  Annual performance bonus;
  Long-term incentives; and
  Pension contributions into a defined contribution 
pension scheme.
It is the Group's policy to ensure that there is a strong 
link between the level of Directors' remuneration and the
performance of the Group. Consequently, only basic salaries
and benefits are fixed. These fixed elements are recognised as
being comparable with other companies. The Remuneration
Committee recognises that the long-term success of the
Group is largely dependent on attracting executives of the
highest quality. Therefore, each Director can significantly
augment their salary through annual bonuses and long-term
incentives. In 2009, a specific element of the bonus awarded
to Mark Elliott, Ian Renton and Tony Harris recognised the
exceptional value that has been created by the Satellite
Information Services ( SIS') media rights agreement. The
Group's contributions to a defined contribution pension
scheme are based on basic salary levels only. 
In addition to the statutory vote to be held on this
Remuneration Report, shareholders will be given the
opportunity to ask the Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee, Andrew Parker Bowles, questions on any 
aspect of the Group's remuneration policy at the 2010 
Annual General Meeting.
The remuneration for Non-Executive Directors consists of
salary or fees for their services in connection with the Board
and Board Committee meetings. They are not eligible for
pension scheme membership. Their fees are determined 
by the Executive Directors who have regard to the level of
salary or fees paid to the non-executive directors of similar
companies and the time commitment required of each 
Non-Executive Director .
Each element of remuneration payable to Executive Directors
is discussed in more detail below.
In addition, Ian Renton received  10,000 as remuneration 
for his non-executive directorship of the BHA.
Basic salary and benefits
Basic salaries for all Executive Directors are reviewed (but
not necessarily increased) annually by the Committee. In
determining the level of basic salaries, the Committee will
give consideration to the Government's published inflation
statistics, salaries for comparable positions in similar sized
companies and any significant change in the role performed
by the Director . The Committee also makes use of benchmark
data provided by external remuneration consultants but 
is mindful of the potential ratcheting effect that such data 
can produce.
In addition to basic salaries, each Executive Director is
entitled to the following main benefits:
  In addition to normal bank and public holidays: 
Chief Executive - 29 working days' holiday per annum,
Finance Director - 26 working days' holiday per annum
and Racing Director - 25 working days' holiday per annum;
  A fully expensed company car or cash equivalent; and
  Private health insurance for themselves, their spouse 
and children.
Bonus
In addition to a basic salary, the Executive Directors are
entitled to an annual performance-related bonus.
Specific performance criteria are set by the Remuneration
Committee at the commencement of the year following
approval of the Group's budgets and are primarily related to
defined strategic and financial objectives of the Group. The
bonus payments that relate to the year under review were
95% of salary for the Chief Executive, 57% of salary for the
Finance Director and 57% for the Racing Director . Of these
annual bonus payments, amounts equivalent to 75% of salary
for the Chief Executive, 38% of salary for the Finance Director
and 45% of salary for the Racing Director related to the
Governance completion of the media rights distribution agreement 
with SIS, which takes effect from 1 January 2012.
The maximum aggregate bonus potential for 2010 of the
Chief Executive is 100% of salary (2009: 100%), the Finance
Director's is 75% of salary (2009: 60%) and the Racing
Director's is 75% of salary (2009: 60%). Given the importance
of retaining the executive management team, and in line with
market levels for companies of similar size and complexity,
the maximum bonus potential of the Finance Director and
Racing Director has been increased from 60% to 75%. 
Long-term incentives
The Committee believes that share ownership and the
granting of share awards strengthen the link between
executives' personal interests and those of shareholders. 
Share options
In October 2006, final grants of share options were made to
the Executive Directors under the Arena Leisure Discretionary
Share Option Scheme, which expired in June 2007. 
Long-term incentive plan
With the expiration of the share option scheme in June 2007,
shareholder approval was obtained for a new long-term
incentive plan ( LTIP') at the 2007 Annual General Meeting.
The LTIP provides for annual conditional awards of equity-
settled shares to be made subject to the achievement 
of challenging performance conditions. The key features 
are set out below.
Maximum award level
The normal maximum annual award is set at 100% of base
salary. In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment 
or retention, awards may be made up to 200% of base salary.
The annual LTIP award can be replaced by an additional
performance-related bonus of up to a maximum of 50% 
of the normal annual bonus award.
Performance conditions
For the initial awards made in 2007, the performance
conditions were structured using absolute adjusted earnings
per share ( EPS') growth targets. This approach enabled the
conditions to be tailored to the specific circumstances of the
Company at the time and its prospects for the next three-
year period. For the purposes of the initial awards, as well 
as for awards made in future years, adjusted EPS is defined
as basic EPS adjusted for certain one-off events.
The awards made in 2007 have not vested because the
performance conditions have not been met.
For awards made in 2008 and future years the performance
conditions are to achieve adjusted EPS growth in excess 
of inflation ( RPI') targets over the performance period. 
The 2009 awards were made later than normal in the year,
on 20 November 2009, and hence an extended performance
period is being applied. The conditions attached to the 2009
awards are as follows for a four-year performance period
ending on 31 December 2012:
Adjusted EPS growth over Vesting percentage of the
the four-year performance period shares subject to award
Less than RPI+16% 0%
RPI+16% 25%
RPI+40% 100%
Between RPI+16% Straight-line vesting occurs
and RPI+40% between 25% and 100%
The conditions attached to the 2008 awards are as follows over
a three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2010:
Adjusted EPS growth over Vesting percentage of the
the three-year performance period shares subject to award
Less than RPI+12% 0%
RPI+12% 25%
RPI+30% 100%
Between RPI+12% Straight-line vesting occurs
and RPI+30% between 25% and 100%
The Committee's intention is that awards will normally 
be made on an annual basis under the LTIP to encourage
sustained earnings growth.
Pension policy
Each of the Executive Directors is entitled to participate in
the Group's defined contribution pension scheme to which
the Company will contribute 8% of basic salary. The pension
scheme provides life insurance cover equal to four times
basic salary.
Service contracts
The Remuneration Committee has adopted the following
policies concerning contracts and service periods which 
will be applied to any future appointment to the Board:
  The notice period required by the Company to terminate
contracts is 12 months for Executive Directors; 
  If the Company terminates without notice the individual 
is entitled to a payment in lieu of notice of up to 
12 months' pay;
  In the event of termination for reasons of misconduct, 
no payment in lieu of notice is payable;
  Executive Directors will be employed under normal
contracts of employment, but are required to give the
Company 12 months' notice of their intention to leave;
  Non-Executive Directors are required to give three months'
notice under the terms of their service contracts; and 
  The notice period required by the Company to terminate
contracts is three months for Non-Executive Directors.
