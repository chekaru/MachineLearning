 Remuneration Report
Governance
As well as complying with the provisions of the Combined 
Code as disclosed in the Corporate Governance Statement, 
the Company has applied the principles relating to Directors' 
remuneration as described below.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of Andrew Parker 
Bowles (Chairman), Andrew Page and David Thorpe (appointed 
19 May 2010). The Committee determines the remuneration 
of the Executive Directors and of certain other senior 
executives within the Company. The Committee also 
determines the Chairman's fee: the Chairman does not 
participate in discussions of his own fee. The Chief Executive 
may, at the Committee's invitation, attend meetings except 
when his own remuneration is discussed.
The Remuneration Committee has appointed independent 
remuneration consultants, Aon Hewitt Ltd, to advise on all 
aspects of senior executive remuneration. Aon Hewitt Ltd 
continues to act as consultant to the Company and has no 
other connection with the Company other than in the 
provision of advice on executive and employee remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The Company's remuneration policy is to pay individual 
Directors a salary or fee at market levels for comparable jobs, 
recognising the size of the Company and the business sector 
in which it operates.
The following comprised the principal elements of Executive 
Directors' remuneration:
 Basic salary and bene ts;
 Annual performance bonus;
 Long-term incentives; and
 Pension contributions into a de ned contribution pension 
scheme.
It is the Group's policy to ensure that there is a strong link 
between the level of Directors' remuneration and the 
performance of Arena. Consequently, only basic salaries and 
bene ts are xed. These xed elements are recognised as 
being comparable with other companies. The Remuneration 
Committee recognises that the long-term success of Arena 
is largely dependent on attracting executives of the highest 
quality. Therefore, each Director can signi cantly augment 
their salary through annual bonuses and long-term incentives. 
The Group's contributions to a de ned contribution pension 
scheme are based on basic salary levels only. 
In addition to the statutory vote to be held on this 
Remuneration Report, shareholders will be given the 
opportunity to ask the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, Andrew Parker Bowles, questions on any 
aspect of the Group's remuneration policy at the 2011 
Annual General Meeting.
The remuneration for Non-Executive Directors consists of 
salary or fees for their services in connection with the Board 
and Board Committee meetings. They are not eligible for 
pension scheme membership. Their fees are determined 
by the Executive Directors who have regard to the level of 
salary or fees paid to the non-executive directors of similar 
companies and the time commitment required of each 
Non-Executive Director.
Each element of remuneration payable to Executive Directors 
is discussed in more detail below.
In addition, Ian Renton received  10,000 (2009:  10,000) as 
remuneration for his non-executive directorship of the British 
Horseracing Authority, the term of which expired in July 2010.

Basic salaries for all Executive Directors are reviewed (but 
not necessarily increased) annually by the Committee. In 
determining the level of basic salaries, the Committee will 
give consideration to the Government's published in ation 
statistics, salaries for comparable positions in similar sized 
companies and any signi cant change in the role performed 
by the Director. The Committee also makes use of benchmark 
data provided by external remuneration consultants but is 
mindful of the potential ratcheting effect that such data 
can produce.
In addition to basic salaries, each Executive Director is 
entitled to the following main bene ts:
 In addition to normal bank and public holidays:  
Chief Executive - 29 working days' holiday per annum, 
Finance Director - 26 working days' holiday per annum 
and Racing Director - 25 working days' holiday per annum;
 A fully expensed company car or cash equivalent; and
 Private health insurance for themselves, their spouse  
and children.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Bonus
In addition to a basic salary, the Executive Directors are 
entitled to an annual performance-related bonus.
Speci c performance criteria are set by the Remuneration 
Committee at the commencement of the year following 
approval of the Group's budgets and are primarily related 
to de ned strategic and nancial objectives of the Group. 
The bonus payments that relate to the year under review 
were 27% of salary for the Chief Executive, 22% of salary 
for the Finance Director and 23% for the Racing Director. 
The maximum aggregate bonus potential for 2010 of 
the Chief Executive was 100% of salary (2009: 100%), 
the Finance Director's was 75% of salary (2009: 75%) 
and the Racing Director's was 75% of salary (2009: 75%). 
Long-term incentives
The Committee believes that share ownership and the 
granting of share awards strengthen the link between 
executives' personal interests and those of shareholders. 
Share options
In October 2006, nal grants of share options were made to 
the Executive Directors under the Arena Leisure Discretionary 
Share Option Scheme, which expired in June 2007. 
Long-term incentive plan
With the expiration of the share option scheme in June 2007, 
shareholder approval was obtained for a new long-term 
incentive plan ( LTIP') at the 2007 Annual General Meeting. 
The LTIP provides for annual conditional awards of equity-
settled shares to be made subject to the achievement 
of challenging performance conditions. The key features 
are set out below.
Maximum award level
The normal maximum annual award is set at 100% of base 
salary. In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or 
retention, awards may be made up to 200% of base salary. 
The annual LTIP award can be replaced by an additional 
performance-related bonus of up to a maximum of 50% 
of the normal annual bonus award.
Performance conditions
For the initial awards made in 2007, the performance 
conditions were structured using absolute adjusted earnings 
per share ( EPS') growth targets. This approach enabled the 
conditions to be tailored to the speci c circumstances of the 
Company at the time and its prospects for the next three-year 
period. For the purposes of the initial awards, as well as for 
awards made in future years, adjusted EPS is de ned as basic 
EPS adjusted for certain one-off events. For awards made 
in 2008 and future years the performance conditions are 
to achieve adjusted EPS growth in excess of in ation ( RPI') 
targets over the performance period.
The awards made in 2007 and 2008 have not vested 
because the performance conditions have not been met.
The 2009 awards were made later than normal in the year, 
on 20 November 2009, and hence an extended performance 
period is being applied. The conditions attached to the 2009 
awards are as follows for a four-year performance period 
ending on 31 December 2012:
Remuneration Report continued
Adjusted EPS growth over the  
four-year performance period
Vesting percentage of the  
shares subject to award
Less than RPI+16% 0%
RPI+16% 25%
RPI+40% 100%
Between RPI+16% and 
RPI+40%
 Straight-line vesting occurs 
 between 25% and 100% 
The 2010 awards were made on 9 August 2010. The 
conditions attached to the 2010 awards are as follows over a 
three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2012:
Adjusted EPS growth over the 
three-year performance period
Vesting percentage of the  
shares subject to award
Less than RPI+30% 0%
RPI+60% 50%
RPI+90% 100%
Between RPI+30% and 
RPI+60%
 Straight-line vesting occurs  
 between 0% and 50%
Between RPI+60% and 
RPI+90%
 Straight-line vesting occurs
  between 50% and 100%
The Committee's intention is that awards will normally be 
made on an annual basis under the LTIP to encourage 
sustained earnings growth.
Pension policy
Each of the Executive Directors is entitled to participate in 
the Group's de ned contribution pension scheme to which 
the Company will contribute 8% of basic salary. The pension 
scheme provides life insurance cover equal to four times 
basic salary.
Service contracts
The Remuneration Committee has adopted the following 
policies concerning contracts and service periods which 
will be applied to any future appointment to the Board:
 The notice period required by the Company to terminate 
contracts is 12 months for Executive Directors; 
 If the Company terminates without notice, the individual  
is entitled to a payment in lieu of notice of up to 
12 months' pay;
 In the event of termination for reasons of misconduct,  
no payment in lieu of notice is payable;
 Executive Directors will be employed under normal 
contracts of employment, but are required to give the 
Company 12 months' notice of their intention to leave;
 Non-Executive Directors are required to give three months' 
notice under the terms of their service contracts; and 
 The notice period required by the Company to terminate 
contracts is three months for Non-Executive Directors.
