 Annual Report 2008 Aricom plc
48
Introduction
This report is prepared in GB Pounds ( GBP' or   ') as the Company 
is headquartered in England, has GB pound functional currency 
and the Directors are predominantly paid in that currency.
The report describes how the Board has applied the principles 
relating to Directors' remuneration.
The Board has prepared this report in accordance with the 
requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985. It is 
intended that an Ordinary Resolution to approve this report will be 
put to the members at this year's Annual General Meeting, but the 
Directors' remuneration is not conditional upon the resolution 
being passed. The report has been divided into separate sections 
for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited Information
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Sir Malcolm Field and 
the other members throughout the year under review were Peter 
Hambro and Sir Roderic Lyne. With effect from 1 January 2009, 
Tony Redman replaced Peter Hambro as a member of the 
Remuneration Committee.
None of the members of the Remuneration Committee has any 
personal financial interest (other than as Shareholders) or day-to-
day involvement in running the business. The Remuneration 
Committee makes recommendations to the Board. 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the review of the 
performance of the Executive Directors. The remuneration and 
conditions of employment of Executive Directors and senior 
Executives are determined by the Remuneration Committee. 
Directors abstain from decisions determining their own 
remuneration. The Remuneration Committee works with the Chief 
Executive on all aspects of remuneration except his own and sets 
the remuneration of the Chief Executive. The scale and structure of 
the Executive Directors' remuneration is approved on the basis of 
their performance, the performance of the Company and their 
service agreements with due regard to the interests of the 
Shareholders and the Company as a whole. The Remuneration 
Committee can make recommendations to the Board concerning 
employee incentives. 
Bearing in mind the provisions of the Combined Code, the 
Remuneration Committee is required to review at least annually the 
remuneration package (comprising base salary, any performance-
related element of salary or bonus, participation in share option 
schemes and other benefits) of each Executive Director as 
proposed by the Chief Executive or previously agreed by the 
Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee is required, at least once a year, to 
review its own performance, constitution and terms of reference to 
ensure it is operating at maximum effectiveness and recommend 
any changes it considers necessary to the Board.
Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors
The Group operates in a highly competitive marketplace for senior 
skilled management which places a strong emphasis on above 
average rewards for outstanding performance. An overriding 
objective is to ensure that the approach to remuneration is simple 
and clear.
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to 
attract, motivate and retain directors of the calibre needed to 
develop and run the Group's businesses and to reward them for 
enhancing value to Shareholders. The performance measurement 
of the Executive Directors and key members of senior management 
and the determination of their annual remuneration package are 
undertaken by the Committee.
As a result, the Company's policy is that a substantial proportion 
of the remuneration of the Executive Directors should be 
performance-related. In structuring the Executive Directors' 
remuneration, the Remuneration Committee's expectation 
is that the split between performance based and fixed would 
be 60%:40%.
The Company's remuneration policy is that the remuneration is 
decided annually by the Remuneration Committee.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package for 
Executive Directors and senior management:
basic annual salary; benefits-in-kind; performance based bonus payments; share option incentives; and pension arrangements. Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside 
the Company providing that the Chairman's permission is obtained 
in advance of any such appointment. Jay Hambro is also a Non-
Executive Director of Peter Hambro Mining plc and received 
and retained an annual fee of  61,000 for the year ended 
31 December 2008.
Basic Salary
Each Executive Director's basic salary is reviewed by the 
Committee at the beginning of each year and when an individual 
changes position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, 
the Committee considers the Group as a whole and relies on 
objective research which gives up-to-date information on a 
comparator group of companies. It is intended that executive 
Directors' contracts of service will be available for inspection 
at the Annual General Meeting.
Awards 2008/2009

Annual Bonus Payments
The Committee establishes specific objectives that must be met for 
each financial year if a performance-related bonus is to be paid; the 
objectives for 2008 are shown below. The Committee believes that 
any incentive compensation awarded should be tied to the 
interests of the Company's Shareholders. Account is also taken of 
the relative success of the different parts of the business for which 
the Executive Directors are responsible and the extent to which the 
strategic objectives set by the Board are being met. The maximum 
performance-related bonus that can be paid is 100% of basic 
annual salary. In exceptional circumstances specifically described, 
the Remuneration Committee can award bonuses above 100% of 
annual salary. 
Bonus Awards 2008
The objectives and achievements for 2008 covered the following:
The need for significant advances with K&S and Garinskoye projects through moving from scoping to bankable feasibility. 
The favourable project economics were presented to 
shareholders and to the market in October 2008. This 
independent result justified the judgement made by Executive 
Management at the time of acquiring the asset. Full bonus for 
this objective was awarded.
The acquisition of valuable strategic assets of Kostenginskoye and Garinskoye Flanks in July 2008. A successful bid presented 
by management against considerable opposition. Full bonus 
was awarded.
Although slightly delayed the start of the crushing and screening plant at Kuranakh. Overall successful operational 
delivery but with a reduced bonus award.
Progressing further to the establishment of the JV with Chinalco, an important strategic partner for the development of Titanium 
Sponge where plant construction has commenced and which is 
on course to start production in 2010. A bonus was awarded for 
finding an appropriate partner and establishing joint venture 
arrangements.
The swift implementation of a cost cutting exercise and conserving of cash. 
Against the achievement of the above objectives the delivery of the 
beneficiation plant at Kuranakh has been delayed to mid 2009. No 
bonus was awarded in respect of this objective.
Executive Directors may earn annual incentive payments of up to 
75% of their basic salary (Chief Executive: 100%) together with the 
benefits of long term share option incentives.
Incentive payments for the year ended 31 December 2008 varied 
between 45% and 60% of basic salary, 10% of which was required 
to be taken in shares purchased in the market by recipients within 
one month of the announcement of the 2008 results and to be held 
for not less than 12 months from the date of the purchase of the 
shares. See table on page 51.
Share Options
During the year ended 31 December 2003, following approval at 
the Annual General Meeting, the Company established a share 
option scheme (the  Share Option Scheme'). The reason for the 
scheme was to incentivise the Executive Directors. The Committee 
had responsibility for supervising the scheme and the grant of 
options under its terms.
There were no performance criteria to be met as it was considered 
that the share price performance was the best indicator of 
performance of the Executive Directors and the options granted 
could be exercised (by the issue of new shares) after a period of 
three years from the date the option was granted. Thereafter the 
option could be exercised for the rest of its life without further 
test, normally provided the grantee is still in employment with 
the Company.
The exercise price of the options granted under the above scheme 
would be equal to the market value of the Company's shares at the 
time when the options were granted. 
The Company's policy has been to grant options to Directors at the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account 
individual performance normally up to a maximum of two times 
annual salary. It has been the Company's policy to phase the 
granting of share options rather than to award them in a single 
large block to any individual other than on commencement 
of employment.
No amendments are proposed to be made to the terms and 
conditions of any entitlement of a Director to share options. 
No further options over ordinary shares will be granted under 
the Company's existing share option scheme following the 
establishment of the Long Term Incentive Plan (see below).
Long Term Incentive Plan 
During the year ended 31 December 2007, the Company 
established a Long Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP') to operate in 
conjunction with an Employee Benefit Trust ( EBT') to provide an 
effective and flexible means of holding assets for the benefit of 
employees and their families and providing valuable long-term 
benefits. Contributions to the EBT will be at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee, which will also recommend allocations 
under the LTIP. The EBT is administered and operated by an 
independent trustee. A second allocation under the LTIP was 
implemented during the year ended 31 December 2008.
The potential beneficiaries of the LTIP include a number of the 
Executive Directors (see table below) and also some senior 
managers within the Group.
The shares allocated to the EBT under the LTIP vest three years 
from the date of allocation and a number of pre-set objectives will 
need to be fulfilled for the LTIP to vest. The full details of these 
objectives contain commercially sensitive information and must be 
fulfilled in order for the shares to vest in full The Remuneration 
Committee expects to publish the objectives in detail at the time 
of vesting. 
The objectives under the allocations cover the delivery of mining 
and production levels of ilmenite and titanomagnetite from 
Kuranakh, the delivery of an appropriate financing package to 
fund both the K&S and Garinskoye projects through to the 
commencement of mining operations, the appointment of 
contractors to build the necessary infrastructure and the 
achievement of predetermined operating profit levels. In addition, 
the implementation of these developments must be conducted to 
the standards set by the HSE Committee of the Board for Safety, 
Health Environment and Communities.

The structure of the LTIP is that, on each allocation, a subsidiary of 
Aricom will provide an interest free loan to the EBT to enable the 
EBT to subscribe for new ordinary shares in Aricom at market value. 
These ordinary shares will be held by the EBT on behalf of the 
potential participants for the vesting period, together with any 
Aricom shares already held by the EBT which have not previously 
been allocated under the LTIP. These shares are therefore held by 
the EBT on behalf of the potential participants for the vesting 
period and, should the Remuneration Committee advise the 
Trustees that the LTIP objectives have been successfully achieved, 
the shares will be sold, the loan repaid and the gains on the shares 
passed to the participants, subject to the provisions of the EBT. 
Shares are not allotted directly to the participants of the scheme.
The allocations made under the LTIP are disclosed on page 52.
The following rules have been set for the operation of the LTIP: 
The maximum number of ordinary shares that may be allocated under the LTIP shall not exceed at any time 5% of the Company's 
issued share capital; 
The number of ordinary shares which may be held in the EBT shall not at any time exceed 5% of the Company's issued 
share capital; 
No further options over ordinary shares will be granted under the Company's existing share option scheme; and 
Awards under the LTIP will be subject to agreed performance conditions as established by the Remuneration Committee. 
However, completion of the performance conditions can be 
waived by the trustees at their sole discretion, but having regard 
to any recommendations by the Remuneration Committee, in 
circumstances where such conditions have become either 
inappropriate or overly onerous by external circumstances. 
Pension Arrangements
Executive Directors have their own pension arrangements and are 
not members of a company pension scheme. 
The Company has agreed to make contributions equivalent to 
between 15% and 17.5% of basic salary into the personal approved 
pension schemes of the Directors and employees. Amounts paid to 
Directors are set out in the Schedule of Directors' Emoluments and 
Compensation on page 51.
Directors' Contracts
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors should have 
contracts for an indefinite term providing for up to a maximum of 
one year's notice. However, it may be necessary occasionally to 
offer longer notice periods to new Directors. Where this arises, it is 
the Company's policy to reduce the notice period to one year 
within two years of appointment of the Director. The service 
contract of Jay Hambro, who was appointed a Director in 2006, 
provides for a notice period of 12 months. All other Executive 
Directors have contracts which are subject to either three or six 
months' notice by either party. 
It is intended that Tony Redman, Pavel Maslovskiy, Peter Hambro 
and Jay Hambro be proposed for re-election at this year's Annual 
General Meeting. Their notice periods, and those of the other 
Directors, are as follows: 
Date of contract Notice period
Executive Directors
Brian Egan 10/07/2007 6 months
Jay Hambro 01/09/2006 12 months
Yuri Makarov 26/04/2004 3 months
Martin Smith 04/04/2006 6 months
Non-Executive Directors
Sir Malcolm Field 01/01/2007 3 months
Peter Hambro 12/12/2003 3 months
Sir Roderic Lyne 26/09/2006 3 months
Dr Pavel Maslovskiy 12/12/2003 3 months
Tony Redman (appointed 01/01/2009)  04/08/2008 3 months
In the event of early termination, the Directors' contracts 
provide for compensation up to a maximum of basic salary 
for the notice period. No compensation will be payable when 
a Director's appointment is terminated for reasons of 
unsatisfactory performance.
Non-Executive Directors
All Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of engagement 
and their remuneration is determined by the Board and based on 
independent surveys of fees paid to Non-Executive Directors of 
similar companies. The basic fee paid to each Non-Executive 
Director in the year was  30,000. The Non-Executive Directors 
receive further fees for additional work performed for the Company 
in respect of membership of the Remuneration Committee, 
Nomination Committee, Health, Safety and Environmental 
Committee and Audit Committee. The additional fees paid to 
Non-Executive Directors are at a rate of  10,000 for membership of 
the Audit Committee and HSE committee,  5,000 for chairmanship 
of the Audit Committee and HSE committee,  5,000 for 
membership of the Remuneration Committee and Nomination 
Committee and  2,500 for chairmanship of the Remuneration 
Committee and Nomination Committee. The Chairman of the 
Company is paid a further  65,000 and the Senior Non-Executive 
Director a further  15,000. Non-Executive Directors were not able 
to participate in the Company's share option scheme with the 
exception of options granted at the initial listing of the Company 
on AIM in 2003.
Directors' Interests in Contracts of Significance 
None of the Directors have interests in contracts of significance 
with the Company or with any of its subsidiaries.
Related party contracts are set out in note 39 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
