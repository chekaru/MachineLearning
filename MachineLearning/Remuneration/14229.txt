 Introduction
This report has been prepared in
accordance with the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002
(the Regulations ).The report also
meets the relevant requirements of the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority and describes how the Board
has applied the Principles of Good
Governance relating to Directors'
remuneration. As required by the
Regulations, a resolution to approve
the report will be proposed at the
Annual General Meeting of the
Company at which the financial
statements will be approved.
The Regulations require the Auditors 
to report to the Group's members on
the auditable part  of the Directors'
remuneration report and to state
whether in their opinion that part of
the report has been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act
1985 (as amended by the Regulations).
The report has therefore been divided
into separate sections for audited and
unaudited information.
Unaudited Information
Remuneration Committee
The Group has established a
Remuneration Committee (the
Committee ) which is constituted in
accordance with the recommendations
of the Combined Code.The members
of the Committee are Sir Mark
Richmond and Mr Dennis Turner who
are both independent Non-Executive
Directors (NEDs ) and the Committee
is chaired by Sir Mark Richmond. In
addition, Mr Peter Keen and Dr Kalevi
Kurkijarvi were also members of the
Committee when the Committee was
considering Directors' remuneration
for 2004.
None of the Committee has any
personal financial interest (other than 
as shareholders) or conflicts of interests
arising from cross-directorships or
day-to-day involvement in running the
business.The Committee makes
recommendations to the Board. No
Director plays a part in any discussion
about his own remuneration.
In determining the Directors'
remuneration for the year, the
Committee consulted Dr Nigel Parker 
(CEO) and Mr Martyn Williams (CFO)
about its proposals.The Committee
reviewed executive compensation
packages in the UK biotech sector. It
also referred to a number of specialist
studies on executive remuneration,
including the annual survey carried out
by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP
in the biotechnology sector.
Remuneration policy
Executive remuneration packages are
prudently designed to attract, motivate
and retain directors of the high calibre
needed to achieve the highest level of
Group performance in accordance
with the best interests of shareholders.
They comprise a mixture of performance
related and non-performance related
remuneration.The performance
measurement of the Executive Directors
and key members of senior management
and the determination of their annual
remuneration package are undertaken
by the Committee.The remuneration
of the NEDs is determined by the Board
within limits set out in the Articles of
Association and with reference to
published data on the level of such
remuneration in other UK-listed
companies in the biotech sector.
There are four main elements of the
remuneration package for Executive
Directors and senior management:
  Basic annual salary and benefits;
  Annual bonus payments which 
currently do not exceed 40% 
of basic salary;
  Share option incentives; and
  Pension arrangements.
The Group's policy is that a substantial
proportion of the remuneration of 
the Executive Directors should be
performance related. As described
below, Executive Directors may earn
annual incentive payments limited to a
specified percentage of their basic salary
(Dr Nigel Parker: 40%, Martyn Williams:
35%) together with the benefits of
participation in share option schemes.
Executive Directors are entitled to
accept appointments outside the 
Group providing that the Chairman's
permission is sought and fees in excess
of  20,000 from all such appointments
are accounted for to the Group.
Basic salary
An Executive Director's basic salary is
determined by the Committee at the
beginning of each year and, from time
to time, when an individual changes
position or responsibility. In deciding
appropriate levels, the Committee
considers the Group as a whole and
relies on objective research which gives
up-to-date information on a comparator
group of companies within the sector.
Account is also taken of the individual
performance of each Executive against
objectives set by the Committee as
well as the pay and conditions of all
employees. Basic salaries were reviewed
in January 2004 with increases taking
effect from 1 January 2004 and further
increases were awarded to take effect
from 8 March 2004, the date on which
the Group's shares were successfully
listed on the London Stock Exchange.
This last increase served to bring the
Group's levels of remuneration for
Executive Directors and senior
management more into line with those
existing in comparable quoted
companies in the sector, reflecting the
increased responsibilities of managing
a listed Company. Executive Directors'
contracts of service, which include
details of remuneration, will
be available for inspection at the
Annual General Meeting.
In addition to basic salary, the Executive
Directors receive certain benefits-in-kind,
principally a car allowance and private
medical insurance.
Annual bonus payments
The Group operates a performance-
related bonus scheme for senior
management, including Executive
Directors. Bonuses are non-pensionable
and, for the financial year 2004, the
maximum bonus was 40% of basic salary.
Bonus payments are based on the
attainment of specific performance criteria
which are directly related to defined
strategic goals which have been approved
by the Committee.Those criteria are
intended to be stretching and are
structured so as to encourage and reward
high levels of achievement consistent
with the interest of shareholders and
the long-term objectives of the Group.
Exceptionally, additional bonus payments
were made to Executive Directors
and senior management in 2004 to
recognise the achievement of the IPO.

Share options
Options over ordinary shares have been
granted to date under five share option
plans, the Ark Therapeutics Limited 2001
Enterprise Management Incentive Share
Option Plan (the 2001 EMI Plan ), the
Ark Group Limited 2003 Enterprise
Management Incentive Share Option
Plan (the 2003 EMI Plan , together with
the 2001 EMI Plan, the EMI Plans ), the
Ark Therapeutics Limited Share Option
Plan (the Old Executive Plan ), the Ark
Group Unapproved Share Option Plan
(the Unapproved Executive Plan ) and
the Non-Executive Director Share
Participation Plan. No further grants will
be made under the Old Executive Plan
or the 2001 EMI Plan. Following the IPO,
employees and Executive Directors are
eligible to participate in the Unapproved
Executive Plan and the Ark Group
Approved Share Option Plan (the
Approved Executive Plan  and together
with the Unapproved Executive Plan the
Executive Plans ), the terms of which
comply with guidelines and best practice
governing the grant of share-based
incentives in a listed company, to the
extent to which the Board considers
such practice to be appropriate to 
the Group. Employees and Executive
Directors may also receive further
options under the 2003 EMI Plan
although immediately following the 
IPO Ark Therapeutics Group plc 
ceased to be a qualifying company 
for the purposes of schedule 5 of the
Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions)
Act 2003.
As stated by the Company in its IPO
Listing Particulars, the Company's
current policy is to grant NEDs share
options (in addition to fees) as part of
their remuneration package, through the
Company's Non-Executive Directors'
Share Participation Plan.This is
considered to be essential to secure the
recruitment and retention of high calibre
NEDs with the appropriate experience
and international perspective in the
context of the Company's stage of
international development (in particular
with a view to accessing the US
market).The NEDs are not eligible to
participate in the Executive Option
Plans and options are granted to them
under the terms of the Non-Executive
Director Share Participation Plan as
summarised below.
Options will become exercisable to 
the extent vested, which is dependent
only on the NED remaining with the
Company. Options granted following the
IPO will vest as to one third annually on
the first, second and third anniversary of
grant.The Board considers that the
terms of the options will not in any way
affect the independent judgement of
Dennis Turner, Sir Mark Richmond, Dr
Wolfgang Plischke and David Prince or
of any additional independent Director
to be appointed in the future.
All outstanding options are over
ordinary shares and any ordinary shares
issued or transferred in satisfaction of
any option shall rank pari passu with the
then existing issued ordinary shares.
Benefits under any of the Share Option
Plans or options detailed below are 
not pensionable.
Under the Executive Plans, options
granted to executive management or
senior corporate staff are subject to a
combination of cash flow management
requirements and the achievement
of certain levels of Total Shareholder
Return. In each of the four years
commencing with the year in which
the option is granted, one quarter
of the option will be tested against
the performance criteria. If cash flow
targets are not met in any one year,
no part of the quarter of the option
may vest in that year. If cash flow targets
are met, then the Company's Total
Shareholder Return, relative to the
comparator group of 18 companies
in the UK listed biotech and
pharmaceutical sectors will be assessed
for the period from the date of grant to
the end of the relevant year. Options
will not vest if Ark is placed in the
bottom quartile, but will vest as to 15%
(of the quarter of the option) if Ark is
placed in the third quartile, 50% if Ark is
at the median and 100% if Ark is placed
in the top quartile, with a straight-line
variation between the median and the
top quartile. Accordingly, options cannot
vest in full until the end of the fourth
year and, even if vested in part in any of
the first three years, may not in normal
circumstances be exercised prior to the
third anniversary of grant. Grants of
options to individuals who are not
executive management or senior
corporate staff will also vest in quarters
over four years but will depend only on
Ark's Total Shareholder Return in
relation to the specified comparator
companies. In any year, one quarter of
the option shall be tested and shall vest
fully at the median and as to 50% below
the median.To the extent vested at the
end of this process, the option may be
exercised for the rest of its ten-year life
without further test.
These performance criteria, which apply
to all Executive Directors to whom
options have been granted under the
scheme, were chosen because they
balance the internal discipline of
managing cash flow with an objective
measure of Ark's performance in
relation to its sector.
The Executive Directors were also
granted options prior to the IPO, under
the terms of the EMI Plans, the Old
Executive Plan and the Unapproved
Executive Plan.The exercise of these
options is not dependent upon
performance criteria.
The exercise price of the options
granted under the above schemes 
is equal to the market value of the
Company's shares at the time when 
the options are granted.The Company's
policy is to grant options annually to
Executive Directors at the discretion of
the Remuneration Committee taking
into account individual performance up
to a maximum of two times salary in
any one year. If the LTIP referred to
below is approved at the forthcoming
AGM, this policy will be modified so that
awards under option schemes and LTIP
combined shall not exceed two times
salary. It is the Company's policy to
phase the granting of share options
rather than to award a single large block
to any individual.
No significant amendments are
proposed to be made to the terms 
and conditions of the Company's 
share option schemes.
The Company is seeking shareholder
approval at the AGM for a new long-term
incentive plan (LTIP ) to be introduced
in respect of the current financial year.
The LTIP will provide for the award of
whole shares, subject to performance
conditions to be determined by the
Remuneration Committee, and is
described in more detail in the separate
Remuneration report continued
0142 Ark _AR_Remuneration 17-26  31/3/05  6:08 pm  Page 18 LTIP summary document enclosed with
this Annual Report. It will ensure that
Ark has available to it the full range
of equity incentives given the significant
developments which have recently taken
place, particularly in relation to tax
and accounting standards, which are
influencing the structure of these awards.
Pension arrangements
In the UK, all employees including
Executive Directors are invited to
participate in the Group Personal
Pension Plan, which is money-purchase
in nature.The only pensionable element
of remuneration is basic salary. During
the year, the Group contributed a
maximum of 12.5% of basic salary to a
Group personal pension scheme in the
name of Mr Williams and in respect of
Dr Parker the Group contributed the
equivalent of 12.5% of basic salary into
a retirement annuity contract in which
he has participated since before joining
the Group.
Performance graph
The following graph shows the
Company's performance, measured by
total shareholder return, compared with
the performance of the comparator
group of companies in the sector as
described above also measured by total
shareholder return.The comparator
group has been selected for this
comparison because it is the
comparator group used by the
Company to determine to what extent
options issued to Executive Directors
and senior managers will vest.
Directors' service contracts
It is the Company's policy that Executive
Directors should have contracts with an
indefinite term providing for a maximum
of one year's notice.This applies to the
contracts of Dr Parker and Mr Williams,
which were effective 8 March 2004.
Dr Parker is required to give 12 months'
notice of termination and Mr Williams
six months.The Company can make
payment of basic salary in lieu of notice.
Non-Executive Directors
All NEDs have specific terms of
engagement with an indefinite term
(terminable on three months' notice
by either party) and their remuneration
is determined by the Board within
the limits set by the Articles of
Association and based on independent
surveys of fees paid to NEDs of similar
companies.The basic fee paid to the
Chairman in the year was  45,000, and
the basic fees paid to the other NEDs
in the year were Mr Keen:  16,385;
Dr Kurkijarvi:  2,083; Professor Martin:
 250; Dr Plischke:  16,379; Mr Prince:
 16,465; Sir Mark Richmond:  27,084
and Professor Yl -Herttuala:  1,917.
The NEDs receive further fees for
attendance at each Board meeting and
for additional work performed for the
Company in respect of chairmanship
or membership of the Remuneration
Committee,Audit Committee and
Nomination Committee. NEDs are
not eligible to join the Group's
pension scheme.
The date of appointment of each of
the NEDs who served as a Director
in the year to 31 December 2004 are
summarised in the table below:
