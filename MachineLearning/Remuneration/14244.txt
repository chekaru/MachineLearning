Directors' remuneration report
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to
the Companies Act 1985 (the Act ). The report also meets the
relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the
principles relating to Directors' remuneration. As required by the
Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the
Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial
statements will be approved.
The Act requires the Auditors to report to the Group's members
on certain parts of the Directors' remuneration report and to
state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been
properly prepared in accordance with the Act. The report has
therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and
unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration Committee
The Group has a Remuneration Committee (the Committee )
which the Company considers is constituted in accordance with
the recommendations of the Combined Code. The members of
the Committee are Sir Mark Richmond, Mr Dennis Turner and,
from 7 July 2005, Dr Bruce Carter, and the Committee is chaired
by Sir Mark Richmond. It is intended that Dr Bruce Carter will
become Chairman of the Committee following this year's AGM,
with Sir Mark Richmond remaining as a Committee member. 
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest (other
than as shareholders), conflicts of interests arising from cross-
directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board. No
Director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own
remuneration.
In considering the Directors' remuneration for the year, the
Committee consulted Dr Nigel Parker (CEO) and Mr Martyn
Williams (CFO) about its proposals and reviewed executive
compensation packages in the UK biotech sector. It also referred
to a number of specialist studies on executive remuneration,
including the annual survey carried out by New Bridge Street
Consultants LLP in the biotechnology sector.
Remuneration policy
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to
attract, motivate and retain Directors of the high calibre needed
to achieve the highest level of Group performance in accordance
with the best interests of shareholders. They comprise a mixture
of performance related and non-performance related
remuneration. The performance measurement of the Executive
Directors and key members of senior management and the
determination of their annual remuneration package are
undertaken by the Committee. The remuneration of the NEDs is
determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of
Association and with reference to published data on the level of
such remuneration in other UK-listed companies in the biotech
sector.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for
Executive Directors and senior management:
  Basic annual salary and benefits;
  Annual bonus payments which currently do not exceed 40%
of basic salary;
  Share option incentives; and
  Pension arrangements.
The Group's policy is that a substantial proportion of the
remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance
related. As described below, Executive Directors may earn annual
incentive payments limited to a specified percentage of their
basic salary (Nigel Parker: 40%, Martyn Williams: 35%) together
with the benefits of participation in share option schemes. The
Committee has the discretion to increase the above percentages
for exceptional performance.
Basic salary
An Executive Director's basic salary is determined by the
Committee at the beginning of each year and, from time to time,
when an individual changes position or responsibility. In deciding
appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a
whole and relies on objective research which gives up-to-date
information on a comparator group of companies within the
sector. Account is also taken of the individual performance of
each Executive against objectives set by the Committee as well
as the pay and conditions of all employees. Basic salaries were
reviewed in January 2005 with increases taking effect from 
1 January 2005. Executive Directors' contracts of service which
include details of remuneration will be available for inspection 
at the AGM.
In addition to basic salary, the Executive Directors receive certain
benefits-in-kind, namely a car allowance and private medical
insurance.
Annual bonus payments
The Group operates a performance-related bonus scheme for
senior management, including Executive Directors. Bonuses are
non-pensionable and, for the financial year 2005, the maximum
bonus was 43% of basic salary. Bonus payments are based on
the attainment of specific performance criteria which are directly
related to defined strategic goals which have been approved by
the Committee. Those criteria are intended to be stretching and
are structured so as to encourage and reward high levels of
achievement consistent with the interest of shareholders and the
long-term objectives of the Group.  Ark Therapeutics Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 19
Directors' remuneration report continued
Share options
Options over ordinary shares have been granted to date under
seven share option plans:
  the Ark Therapeutics Limited 2001 Enterprise Management
Incentive Share Option Plan (the 2001 EMI Plan ), 
  the Ark Therapeutics Group Limited 2003 Enterprise
Management Incentive Share Option Plan (the 2003 EMI
Plan , together with the 2001 EMI Plan, the EMI Plans ),
  the Ark Therapeutics Limited Share Option Plan 
(the Old Executive Plan ), 
  the Ark Therapeutics Group Unapproved Share Option Plan
(the Unapproved Executive Plan ), 
  the Ark Therapeutics Group Approved Share Option Plan 
(the Approved Executive Plan ), 
  the Non-Executive Director Share Participation Plan 
(the NED Plan ) and 
  the Ark Therapeutics Group Consultancy Share Option Plan
(the Consultants' Plan ) 
No grants have been made in the period under the Old
Executive Plan or the 2001 EMI Plan, nor will there be any
further grants under these plans in the future. Employees and
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Approved
Executive Plan and the Unapproved Executive Plan (together
the Executive Plans ), the terms of which comply with
guidelines and best practice governing the grant of share-based
incentives in a listed company, to the extent to which the Board
considers such practice to be appropriate to the Group. 
In the period under review, no share options were granted to
NEDs under the NED Plan, other than to Dr Bruce Carter, a US-
based NED, on his appointment in July 2005. In last year's
Directors' remuneration report, the Company noted its
intention to grant share options under the NED Plan, in order
to recruit a NED with appropriate qualifications and experience,
particularly in respect of accessing the US biotechnology
market, and Dr Carter was this appointee. Since the IPO, the
only other options granted to NEDs were those awarded to
David Prince in May 2004, as part of his appointment package,
the principles of which were outlined in the Company's IPO
Listing Particulars. Going forward, the Company does not
intend to grant further share options to existing NEDs, but may
determine that it needs to grant share options under the NED
Plan as part of the appointment package of further
internationally qualified and experienced NEDs where the
Company is advised that such options are necessary to secure
their appointment.
NED options will become exercisable to the extent vested,
which is dependent only on the NED remaining with the
Company, and will vest as to one third annually on the first,
second and third anniversary of grant. The Board considers
that the terms of the options do not in any way affect the
independent judgment of Sir Mark Richmond, Dr Wolfgang
Plischke, David Prince or Dr Bruce Carter or of any additional
independent NED to be appointed in the future. In accordance
with the recommendations of the Combined Code, the
relevant NEDs have agreed that they will not dispose of shares
arising from the exercise of options granted under the NED
Plan since the Company's IPO for at least one year from the
date their directorship terminates.
Professor Seppo Yl -Herttuala, a Non-Executive Director, was
awarded 50,000 options in the year under the Consultants'
Plan in respect of his services to the Company as a consultant.
All outstanding options are over ordinary shares and any
ordinary shares issued or transferred in satisfaction of any
option shall rank pari passu with the then existing issued
ordinary shares. Benefits under any of the share option plans
or LTIP detailed below are not pensionable.
Under the Executive Plans, options granted to executive
management or senior corporate staff are subject to a
combination of cash flow management requirements and the
achievement of certain levels of Total Shareholder Return. In
each of the four years commencing with the year in which the
option is granted, one quarter of the option will be tested
against the performance criteria. If cash flow targets are not
met in any one year, no part of the quarter of the option may
vest in that year. If cash flow targets are met, then the
Company's Total Shareholder Return, relative to the
comparator group of 17 (one of the original 18 companies,
Xenova, was taken over and de-listed in the period) biotech
companies in the UK listed biotech and pharmaceutical sectors
(see next page) will be assessed for the period from the date
of grant to the end of the relevant year. Options will not vest if
Ark is placed in the bottom quartile, but will vest as to 15% 
(of the quarter of the option being tested) if Ark is placed in
the third quartile, 50% if Ark is at the median and 100% if Ark
is placed in the top quartile, with a straight-line variation
between the median and the top quartile. Accordingly, options
cannot vest in full until the end of the fourth year and, even if
vested in part in any of the first three years, may not in
normal circumstances be exercised prior to the third
anniversary of grant. To the extent vested at the end of this
process, the option may be exercised for the rest of its ten-
year life without further test. These performance criteria,
which apply to all Executive Directors to whom options have
been granted under the scheme, were chosen because they
balance the internal discipline of managing cash flow with an
objective measure of Ark's performance in relation to its
sector. Prior to the Company's IPO (which occurred in March
2004), the Executive Directors were also granted options under
the terms of the EMI Plans, the Old Executive Plan and the
Unapproved Executive Plan. The exercise of these options is
not dependent upon performance criteria.  Ark Therapeutics Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 20

The exercise price of the options granted under the above
schemes is equal to the market value of the Company's shares
at the time when the options are granted. The Company
received approval at the Annual General Meeting held on 28
April 2005 for a new long-term incentive plan (LTIP ), under
which awards take the form of nil paid  options and are
subject to a combination of cash management requirements
and the achievement of certain levels of Total Shareholder
Return. No LTIP awards were made in the year under review.
The Company's policy is to grant options annually to Executive
Directors at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee
taking into account individual performance up to a maximum
of two times salary in any one year, inclusive of any LTIP
awards. It is the Company's policy to phase the granting of
share options rather than to award a single large block to any
individual.
No significant amendments are proposed to be made to the
terms and conditions of the Company's share option or LTIP
schemes.
Pension arrangements
In the UK, all employees including Executive Directors are
invited to participate in the Group Personal Pension Plan,
which is money-purchase in nature. The only pensionable
element of remuneration is basic salary. During the year, the
Group contributed a maximum of 12.5% of basic salary in
relation to Executive Directors to a Group personal pension
scheme in the name of each Executive Director with the
exception of Dr Parker for whom the equivalent of 12.5% 
of basic salary was paid into a retirement annuity contract in
which he participated prior to joining the Group. 
Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance,
measured by Total Shareholder Return, compared with the
performance of the comparator group of companies in the
sector as described above also measured by Total Shareholder
Return. The comparator group has been selected for this
comparison because it is the comparator group used by the
Company to determine to what extent options issued to
Executive Directors and senior managers will vest.

Directors' service contracts
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors should have
contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of
one year's notice. This applies to the contracts of Dr Parker and
Mr Williams, which were effective 8 March 2004. Dr Parker is
required to give twelve months' notice of termination and Mr
Williams six months. The Company can make payment of basic
salary in lieu of notice.
Non-Executive Directors
All NEDs have specific terms of engagement with an indefinite
term (terminable on three months' notice by either party) and
their remuneration is determined by the Chairman of the
Board and the Executive Directors (save in the case of the
Chairman of the Board, whose remuneration is determined by
the Executive Directors) within the limits set by the Articles of
Association and based on independent surveys of fees paid to
NEDs of similar companies. The basic fee paid to the Chairman
in the year was  50,000, and the basic fees paid to the other
NEDs in the year were Dr Carter:  11,303; Mr Keen:  20,000;
Dr Plischke:  20,000; Mr Prince:  20,000; Sir Mark Richmond:
 20,000 and Professor Yl -Herttuala:  2,000. The NEDs receive
further fees for attendance at each Board meeting and for
additional work performed for the Company in respect of
chairmanship or membership of the Remuneration Committee,
Audit Committee and Nomination Committee. NEDs are not
eligible to join the Group's pension scheme.
The details of the appointments of the NEDs who served as a
Director in the year to 31 December 2005 are summarised in
the table below:
