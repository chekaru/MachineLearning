Directors' remuneration report
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to
the Companies Act 1985 (the Act ). The report also meets the
relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the
principles relating to Directors' remuneration. As required by the
Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the
Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial
statements will be approved.
The Act requires the Auditors to report to the Group's members
on certain parts of the Directors' remuneration report and to
state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Act. The report
has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and
unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration Committee
The Group has a Remuneration Committee (the Committee )
which the Company considers is constituted in accordance with
the recommendations of the Combined Code. The members of
the Committee are Sir Mark Richmond, Dennis Turner and Dr
Bruce Carter. Dr Carter was elected as Chairman of the
Committee following the AGM in April 2006, succeeding Sir Mark
Richmond.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest (other
than as shareholders), conflicts of interests arising from cross-
directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board. No
Director plays a part in any discussion about his own
remuneration.
In considering the Directors' remuneration for the year, the
Committee consulted Dr Nigel Parker (CEO) and Martyn Williams
(CFO) about its proposals and reviewed executive compensation
packages in the UK biotech sector. It also referred to a number of
specialist studies on executive remuneration, including the annual
survey carried out by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP in the
biotechnology sector.
Remuneration policy
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to
attract, motivate and retain directors of the high calibre needed
to achieve the highest level of Group performance in accordance
with the best interests of shareholders. They comprise a mixture
of performance related and non-performance related
remuneration. The performance measurement of the Executive
Directors and key members of senior management and the
determination of their annual remuneration package are
undertaken by the Committee. The remuneration of the NEDs is
determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of
Association and with reference to published data on the level of
such remuneration in other UK-listed companies in the biotech
sector.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package for
Executive Directors and senior management:
  Basic annual salary and benefits;
  Annual bonus payments;
  Share option incentives; 
  Pension arrangements; and
  Long term incentive plans (LTIPs).
The Group's policy is that a substantial proportion of the
remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance
related. As described below, Executive Directors may earn annual
incentive payments linked to a specified target percentage of
their basic salary (Dr Nigel Parker: 40%, Martyn Williams: 35%)
together with the benefits of participation in share option
schemes. The Committee has the discretion to increase the
above incentive payment percentages by up to one half for
exceptional performance.
Basic salary
An Executive Director's basic salary is determined by the
Committee at the beginning of each year and, from time to time,
when an individual changes position or responsibility. In deciding
appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a
whole and relies on objective research which gives up-to-date
information on a comparator group of companies within the
sector. Account is also taken of the individual performance of
each Executive against objectives set by the Committee as well
as the pay and conditions of all employees. Basic salaries were
reviewed in January 2006, with increases taking effect from 1
January 2006. Executive Directors' contracts of service which
include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at
the AGM.
In addition to basic salary, the Executive Directors receive certain
benefits-in-kind, namely a car allowance and private medical
insurance.
Annual bonus payments
The Group operates a performance-related bonus scheme for
senior management, including Executive Directors. Bonuses are
non-pensionable and, for the financial year 2006, the maximum
bonus was 44% of basic salary. Bonus payments are based on
the attainment of specific performance criteria which are directly
related to defined strategic goals which have been approved by
the Committee. Those criteria are intended to be stretching and
are structured so as to encourage and reward high levels of
achievement consistent with the interest of shareholders and the
long term objectives of the Group.  Ark Therapeutics Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 19
Directors' remuneration report continued
Share options
Options over ordinary shares have been granted to date under
seven share option plans:
  the Ark Therapeutics Limited 2001 Enterprise Management
Incentive Share Option Plan (the 2001 EMI Plan ), 
  the Ark Therapeutics Group Limited 2003 Enterprise
Management Incentive Share Option Plan (the 2003 EMI
Plan , together with the 2001 EMI Plan, the EMI Plans ),
  the Ark Therapeutics Limited Share Option Plan (the Old
Executive Plan ), 
  the Ark Therapeutics Group Unapproved Share Option Plan (the
Unapproved Executive Plan ), 
  the Ark Therapeutics Group Approved Share Option Plan (the
Approved Executive Plan ), 
  the Non-Executive Director Share Participation Plan (the NED
Plan ) and 
  the Ark Therapeutics Group Consultancy Share Option Plan (the
Consultants' Plan ) 
and, for the first time in 2006, under the Company's long term
incentive plan, the Ark Therapeutics Group 2005 Long Term
Incentive Plan (the LTIP ).
No grants have been made in the period under the Old Executive
Plan, the 2001 EMI Plan or the NED Plan, nor will there be any
further grants under these plans in the future. Employees and
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Approved
Executive Plan and the Unapproved Executive Plan (together the
Executive Plans ) and the LTIP , the terms of which comply with
guidelines and best practice governing the grant of share-based
incentives in a listed company, to the extent to which the Board
considers such practice to be appropriate to the Group. 
In the period under review, no share options were granted to
NEDs under the NED Plan. The NEDs hold options granted prior to
the Company's IPO or, in the case of Dr Carter and Mr Prince,
granted as part of their recruitment package. Going forward, the
Company does not intend to grant any further share options
under the NED Plan.
NED options become exercisable to the extent vested, which is
dependent only on the NED remaining with the Company, and
will vest as to one third annually on the first, second and third
anniversary of grant. The Board considers that the terms of the
options do not in any way affect the independent judgment of
Sir Mark Richmond, Dr Wolfgang Plischke, David Prince, Peter
Keen or Dr Bruce Carter. In accordance with the
recommendations of the Combined Code, the NEDs have agreed
that they will not dispose of shares arising from the exercise of
options granted under the NED Plan since the Company's IPO for
at least one year from the date their directorship terminates.
Professor Seppo Yl -Herttuala, a Non-Executive Director, was
awarded 50,000 options in the year under the Consultants' Plan
in respect of his services to the Company as a consultant.
All outstanding options are over ordinary shares and any ordinary
shares issued or transferred in satisfaction of any option shall
rank pari passu with the then existing issued ordinary shares.
Benefits under any of the share option plans or LTIP detailed
below are not pensionable.
Under the original performance criteria of the Executive Plans,
options granted to executive management or senior corporate
staff were subject to a combination of cash flow management
requirements and the achievement of certain comparative levels
of Total Shareholder Return (TSR ). In each of the four years
commencing with the year in which the option was granted, one
quarter of the option would be tested against the performance
criteria. If cash flow targets were not met in any one year, no
part of the quarter of the option would have vested in that year.
Accordingly, options could not have vested in full until the end of
the fourth year and, even if vested in part in any of the first
three years, could not in normal circumstances have been
exercised prior to the third anniversary of grant. To the extent
vested at the end of this process, the option could have been
exercised for the rest of its ten year life without further test. 
Prior to the Company's IPO (which occurred in March 2004), the
Executive Directors were also granted options under the terms of
the EMI Plans, the Old Executive Plan and the Unapproved
Executive Plan. The exercise of these options is not dependent
upon performance criteria. The exercise price of the options
granted under the above schemes is equal to the market value
of the Company's shares at the time when the options are
granted. 
Under the Consultant's Plan, TSR has been the sole performance
criterion.
LTIP
Under the LTIP , awards take the form of nil paid  options and
under the original performance criteria were subject to a
combination of cash management requirements and the
achievement of certain levels of TSR. At the end of three years,
commencing with the year in which the option was granted, the
option would be tested against the performance criteria. 
In 2006 the Committee engaged the Hay Group Plc to review all
elements of remuneration for executive management and senior
corporate staff and make recommendations consistent with the
Group's remuneration policy. As part of this brief, the Hay Group
was asked to review current share-based incentive schemes and,
in particular, the TSR performance condition upon which the
exercise of options is dependent and to report on their suitability
and effectiveness in stimulating the development of long term Ark Therapeutics Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 20

Directors' remuneration report continued
shareholder value. The Hay Group have advised that the use of
relative TSR is not, in the circumstances, the most appropriate
criterion for stimulating performance and generating increased
shareholder value. They recommended that the Board consider
basing performance on the achievement of key milestones that
in their judgment will be the determinants and drivers of
shareholder value, delivery of which is the primary goal of
management.
In the Board's view the most important strategic factors that will
ultimately add value to the business are its unique science and its
ability to translate this science into successful products in the
major markets. In that context, the contributions of the executive
management and senior corporate staff are fundamental.
Executives need to ensure that:
  They enable and facilitate scientific research and development.
  They prioritise and drive the international commercialisation of
each therapeutic candidate.
  The business remains adequately funded to achieve these
goals.
  A robust relationship is maintained with academics so that
they remain involved and motivated. 
The Remuneration Committee has, therefore, concluded that the
use of TSR in assessing performance for vesting of share-based
incentives should be replaced by a number of specific, externally
verifiable corporate milestones, the achievement of which over a
three year period would determine whether and to what extent
options and LTIPs vest. Accordingly, for option awards made
under the Executive Plans, the Consultants' Plan and the LTIP , the
following milestones have been identified for the 2007 grant of
options.
1 January 2007 - 31 December 2009
1. Approval of Cerepro  in Europe or USA 30%
2. Vitor  - execute processes to complete Phase III study 15%
3. Trinam
 
- execute processes to complete enrolment into 
Phase III study 20%
4. Build profitable, stand-alone woundcare/devices business 10%
5. Further exploitation of ACE/ATII receptor/stroke patent 15%
6. Expand clinical portfolio with at least one further candidate 10%
The Remuneration Committee considers that the achievement of
the above milestones are expected to be the key events to drive
enhanced shareholder value. Where an individual milestone is
achieved before the end of the three year period, the percentage
of the total award attributed to that particular milestone will vest
but will not be exercisable until the third anniversary of grant. For
future awards, the milestones will be set at the time of grant to
reflect the key value drivers of the business at that time.
Furthermore, the Remuneration Committee considers it
important to take into account the fact that the Company has
had a highly successful year in 2006 with the following major
developments and achievements all essential to the building of
long term value in the Company:-
  Cerepro  MAA filing progressed with EMEA
  Cerepro  Phase III/IV study recruitment advanced to plan
  Vitor  study confirms therapeutic effect in cancer cachexia 
  Vitor  - successful end of initial Phase III FDA/EMEA meetings
  Trinam
 
positive Phase II results achieved
  Trinam
 
- successful end of Phase II FDA meeting
  Placing and Open Offer successfully executed
  Flaminal
 
in-licensed and launched
  Kerraboot
 
- six further international distribution deals signed
  Scavidin
 
- first proof-of-concept demonstrated in pre-clinical
cancer models
In light of these achievements, the Remuneration Committee
and Board have decided to exercise their powers under the
Executive Plans and the LTIP to vary performance conditions
where these are considered to have ceased to be appropriate. In
particular, the Remuneration Committee has determined that this
is the case in respect of the annual company-wide grant of
options of 4 January 2006. Under the TSR performance criteria for
executive management and senior corporate staff, only 15% of
one quarter of the options from that grant capable of vesting at
31 December 2006 would vest, despite the very significant
progress made by the Company as described above. For other
employees and consultants, 50% would have vested. The
Remuneration Committee has, therefore, determined that
instead, 100% of that quarter of options falling due for vesting
would vest at 31 December 2006. This means that Dr Parker's
and Mr Williams' options would vest as to 72,500 and 28,125
shares respectively instead of 10,875 and 4,219 respectively
under the original performance conditions. In total, for all
employees, consultants and executive directors this would result
in 358,250 options vesting at 31 December 2006 compared with
113,763 options under the original performance conditions. This
decision follows a consultation process with a number of the
Company's major shareholders, who fully supported the proposal
in the light of the Company's outstanding progress against
milestones during 2006.
For the 2006 LTIP award, milestone-based performance criteria
will be applied.
The Company's policy is to grant options annually to Executive
Directors at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee taking
into account individual performance up to a maximum of two
times salary in any one year, inclusive of any LTIP awards. It is
the Company's policy to phase the granting of share options
rather than to award a single large block to any individual.
Pension arrangements
In the UK, all employees including Executive Directors are invited
to participate in the Group Personal Pension Plan, which is Ark Therapeutics Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 21
money-purchase in nature. The only pensionable element of
remuneration is basic salary. During the year, the Group
contributed a maximum of 15% of basic salary in relation to
Executive Directors to a Group personal pension scheme in the
name of each Executive Director with the exception of Dr Parker
for whom a maximum of 17% of basic salary was contributed to
a retirement annuity contract in which he participated prior to
joining the Group. 
Performance graph
The graph below shows the Company's performance, measured
by TSR, compared with the performance of the comparator group
of companies in the sector also measured by TSR. This is relevant
to the Group's original performance criteria for options and LTIP
awards as set out above. The comparator group was selected for
this comparison because it was the comparator group used by
the Company to determine to what extent options issued to
Executive Directors and senior managers will vest (under the
previous performance criteria).
Directors' service contracts
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors should have
contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of
one year's notice. This applies to the contracts of Dr Parker and
Mr Williams, which were effective 8 March 2004. Dr Parker is
required to give twelve months notice of termination and Mr
Williams six months. The Company can make payment of basic
salary in lieu of notice.
Non-Executive Directors
All NEDs have specific terms of engagement with an indefinite
term (terminable on three months' notice by either party) and
their remuneration is determined by the Chairman of the Board
and the Executive Directors (save in the case of the Chairman of
the Board, whose remuneration is determined by the Executive
Directors) within the limits set by the Articles of Association and
based on independent surveys of fees paid to NEDs of similar
companies. The basic fee paid to the Chairman in the year was
 55,000, and the basic fees paid to the other NEDs in the year
were Dr Carter:  22,000; Mr Keen:  22,000; Dr Plischke:  22,000;
Mr Prince:  22,000; Sir Mark Richmond:  22,000 and Professor
Yl -Herttuala:  2,000. The NEDs receive further fees for
attendance at each Board meeting and for additional work
performed for the Company in respect of chairmanship or
membership of the Remuneration Committee, Audit Committee
and Nomination Committee. NEDs are not eligible to join the
Group's pension scheme.
The details of the appointments of the NEDs who served as a
Director in the year to 31 December 2006 are summarised in the
