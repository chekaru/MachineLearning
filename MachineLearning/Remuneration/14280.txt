 Directors' remuneration report
Ark Therapeutics Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 18
www.arktherapeutics.com
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A 
to the Companies Act 1985 (the Act ). The report also meets 
the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the
principles relating to Directors' remuneration in the Combined
Code. As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report
will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company
at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the Auditors to report to the Group's members
on certain parts of the Directors' remuneration report and to
state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Act. The report
has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and
unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration Committee
The Group has a Remuneration Committee (the Committee )
which the Company considers is constituted in accordance with
the recommendations of the Combined Code. The members of
the Committee during 2007 were Sir Mark Richmond, Dennis
Turner and Dr Bruce Carter (Chairman). Dr Carter resigned from
the Remuneration Committee with effect from 31 December
2007 and was replaced by Peter Keen, who was also appointed
as Chairman, with effect from 1 January 2008. Once he has been
appointed as a NED at the Annual General Meeting, it is intended
that Andrew Christie will replace Mr Turner on the Committee.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest (other
than as shareholders or optionholders), conflicts of interests
arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in
running the business. The Committee makes recommendations 
to the Board. No Director plays a part in any discussion about his
own remuneration.
In considering the Directors' remuneration for the year, the
Committee consulted Dr Nigel Parker (CEO) and Martyn Williams
(CFO) about its proposals and reviewed executive compensation
packages in the UK biotech sector. The Committee also engaged
the Hay Group to review all elements of remuneration for
executive management and senior corporate staff and make
recommendations consistent with the Group's remuneration
policy. The Hay Group did not provide any other services to the
Company or Group. The Committee also referred to a number of
specialist studies on executive remuneration, including the annual
survey carried out by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP in the
biotechnology sector.
Remuneration policy
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to
attract, motivate and retain senior management of the high
calibre needed to achieve the highest level of Group performance
in accordance with the best interests of shareholders. 
They comprise a mixture of performance-related and 
non-performance-related remuneration. The performance
measurement of the Executive Directors and key members 
of senior management and the determination of their annual
remuneration package are undertaken by the Committee. The
remuneration of the NEDs is determined by the Board within
limits set out in the Articles of Association. No changes in respect
of the remuneration policy are expected in the foreseeable
future.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package for
Executive Directors and senior management:
  Basic annual salary and benefits;
  Annual bonus payments;
  Share option incentives; 
  Pension arrangements; and
  Long-term incentive plans (LTIPs).
The Group's policy is that a substantial proportion of the
remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior management
should be performance related. As described below, Executive
Directors may earn annual incentive payments linked to a
specified target percentage of their basic salary (Dr Nigel Parker:
50%, Martyn Williams: 40%) together with the benefits of
participation in share option schemes. The Committee has the
discretion to increase the above percentages by up to one half
for exceptional performance.
Basic salary
An Executive Director's basic salary is determined by the
Committee at the beginning of each year and, from time to time,
when an individual changes position or responsibility. In deciding
appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a
whole and relies on objective research which gives up-to-date
information on a comparator group of companies within the
sector. Account is also taken of the individual performance of
each Executive against objectives set by the Committee as well
as the pay and conditions of all employees. Basic salaries were
reviewed in January 2007, with increases taking effect from 
1 January 2007. Executive Directors' contracts of service which
include details of remuneration will be available for inspection 
at the Annual General Meeting.
In addition to basic salary, the Executive Directors receive certain
benefits-in-kind, namely a car allowance and private medical
insurance.
Annual bonus payments
The Group operates a performance-related bonus scheme for
senior management, including Executive Directors. Bonuses are
non-pensionable and, for the financial year 2007, the maximum
bonus was 60% of basic salary. Bonus payments are based on
the attainment of specific performance criteria which are directly
related to defined strategic goals which have been approved by
the Committee. Those criteria are intended to be stretching and
are structured so as to encourage and reward high levels of
achievement consistent with the interest of shareholders and 
the long-term objectives of the Group. 
Share options
Options over ordinary shares have been granted to date under
nine share option plans;
  the Ark Therapeutics Limited 2001 Enterprise Management
Incentive Share Option Plan (the 2001 EMI Plan ); 
  the Ark Therapeutics Group Limited 2003 Enterprise
Management Incentive Share Option Plan (the 2003 EMI
Plan , together with the 2001 EMI Plan, the EMI Plans );   the Ark Therapeutics Limited Scavidin
 
Stand-alone Plan 
(the Scavidin
 
Plan );
  the Ark Therapeutics Limited Share Option Plan 
(the Old Executive Plan ); 
  the Ark Therapeutics Group Unapproved Share Option Plan
(the Unapproved Executive Plan ); 
  the Ark Therapeutics Group Approved Share Option Plan 
(the Approved Executive Plan ); 
  the Non-Executive Director Share Participation Plan 
(the NED Plan ); 
  the Ark Therapeutics Group Consultancy Share Option Plan
(the Consultants' Plan ); and 
  the Ark Therapeutics Group 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan
(the LTIP ).
No grants have been made in the period under the Old Executive
Plan, the EMI Plans, the Scavidin
 
Plan or the NED Plan, nor will
there be any further grants under these plans in the future.
Employees and Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the
Approved Executive Plan and the Unapproved Executive Plan
(together the Executive Plans ) and the LTIP , the terms of which
comply with guidelines and best practice governing the grant of
share-based incentives in a listed company, to the extent to which
the Board considers such practice to be appropriate to the Group.
In the period under review, no share options were granted to
NEDs under the NED Plan. The NEDs hold options granted prior 
to the Company's IPO or, in the case of Dr Carter and Mr Prince,
granted as part of their recruitment package. The Company no
longer grants share options under the NED Plan.
NED options become exercisable to the extent vested, which is
dependent only on the NED remaining with the Company, and
will vest as to one third annually on the first, second and third
anniversary of grant. The Board considers that the terms of the
options do not in any way affect the independent judgment 
of Sir Mark Richmond, Dr Wolfgang Plischke, David Prince, Peter
Keen or Dr Bruce Carter. In accordance with the recommendations
of the Combined Code, the NEDs have agreed that they will not
dispose of shares arising from the exercise of options granted
under the NED Plan since the Company's IPO for at least one year
from the date their directorship terminates.
Professor Seppo Yl -Herttuala, a Non-Executive Director, was
awarded 60,000 options in the year under the Consultants' Plan
in respect of his services to the Company as a consultant.
All outstanding options are over ordinary shares and any ordinary
shares issued or transferred in satisfaction of any option shall
rank pari passu with the then existing issued ordinary shares.
Benefits under any of the share option plans or LTIP detailed
below are not pensionable.
The vesting of share-based incentives under the Executive Plans,
the Consultants' Plan and the LTIP is determined by assessing
performance against a number of specific, externally verifiable
corporate milestones, the achievement of which over a three-
year period determines whether and to what extent options and
LTIPs vest. The following milestones were identified for the 2007
grant of options.
1 January 2007 - 31 December 2009
1. Approval of Cerepro
 
in Europe or USA 30%
2. Vitor
TM
- execute processes to complete Phase III study 15%
3. Trinam
 
- execute processes to complete enrolment into
Phase III study 20%
4. Build profitable, stand-alone wound care/devices 
business 10%
5. Further exploitation of ACE/ATII receptor/stroke patent 15%
6. Expand clinical portfolio with at least one further 
candidate 10%
The Remuneration Committee considers that the above
milestones are expected to be the key events to drive enhanced
shareholder value. Where an individual milestone is achieved
before the end of the three year period, the percentage of the
total award attributed to that particular milestone will vest as 
to performance but will not be exercisable until the third
anniversary of grant. For future awards, the milestones will be
set at the time of grant to reflect the key value drivers of the
business at that time.
To the extent vested at the end of the three year period from
the date of grant, options are exercisable for the rest of their
ten-year life without further test.
Under the original performance criteria of the Executive Plans,
options granted to executive management or senior corporate
staff were subject to a combination of cash flow management
requirements and the achievement of certain comparative levels
of Total Shareholder Return (TSR ). Under the Consultants' Plan,
TSR was previously the sole performance criterion.
Prior to the Company's IPO (which occurred in March 2004), the
Executive Directors were also granted options under the terms 
of the EMI Plans, the Old Executive Plan and the Unapproved
Executive Plan. The exercise of these options is not dependent
upon performance criteria. The exercise price of the options
granted under the above schemes is equal to the market value
of the Company's shares at the time when the options were
granted. 
Outstanding options may become exercisable before their normal
exercise date in the event of a change of control of the Company,
in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan.
LTIP
Under the LTIP , awards take the form of  nil paid' options and 
are subject to the achievement of the same key milestones
described above which, in the Board's judgement, will be the
determinants and drivers of shareholder value and delivery of
which is the primary goal of management. At the end of three
years, commencing with the year in which the option was
granted, the option is tested against the performance criteria.
The Company's policy is to consider the grant of awards annually
to Executive Directors at the discretion of the Remuneration
Committee taking into account individual performance up to a
maximum of two times salary in any one year, inclusive of any
LTIP awards. It is the Company's policy to phase the grant of
awards rather than to grant a single large award to any
individual.

In 2008, the Board has resolved not to make LTIP awards to
those who are eligible to benefit from funds made available to
the Ark Therapeutics Group Family Benefit Trust (the FBT ), as
described below. It has also resolved to treat any shares issued to
the trustee of the FBT as reducing the number of new shares that
may be issued under the LTIP . 
FBT
The Board resolved to make funds available to the trustee of the
FBT, on the basis of the trustee's agreement to the Company's
request that the trustee would subscribe for shares in the
Company at market value, and appoint the shares to sub-funds.
The appointments are to remain conditional for three years from
the date of the appointment, and will then only become
unconditional to the extent that the key milestones described 
in the share options  section above are achieved.
Accordingly, on 4 January 2008, the trustee of the FBT subscribed
for 1,355,000 ordinary shares of 1 pence each in the Company. 
Of these, 630,000 shares have been conditionally appointed to 
a sub-fund whose class of discretionary beneficiaries includes 
Dr Nigel Parker and 240,000 shares have been conditionally
appointed to a sub-fund whose class of discretionary
beneficiaries includes Martyn Williams. The balance of 485,000
shares have been appointed to sub-funds whose class of
discretionary beneficiaries does not include Directors of the
Company.
Whilst ordinary shares are held within the Trust, the voting rights
in respect of those shares are exercisable by the trustees in
accordance with their fiduciary duties.
Pension arrangements
In the UK, all employees including Executive Directors are invited
to participate in the Group Personal Pension Plan, which is
money-purchase in nature. The only pensionable element 
of remuneration is basic salary. During the year, the Group
contributed 15% of basic salary to a Group personal pension
scheme in the name of Martyn Williams and 17% of basic salary
in respect of Nigel Parker to a retirement annuity contract in
which he participated prior to joining the Group. 
Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance,
measured by TSR, compared with the performance of the
comparator group of companies in the sector also measured by
TSR. This is relevant to the Group's original performance criteria
for options and LTIP awards as set out above. The comparator
group was selected for this comparison because it was the
comparator group used by the Company to determine to what
extent options issued to Executive Directors and senior managers
will vest (under the previous performance criteria).

Directors' remuneration report
continued  Directors' service contracts
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors should have
contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of
one year's notice. This applies to the contracts of Dr Parker and
Mr Williams, which were effective 8 March 2004. Dr Parker is
required to give twelve months' notice of termination and 
Mr Williams six months. The Company can make payment 
of basic salary in lieu of notice.
Non-Executive Directors 
All NEDs have specific terms of engagement with an indefinite
term (terminable on three months' notice by either party) and
their remuneration is determined by the Chairman of the Board
and the Executive Directors (save in the case of the Chairman of
the Board, whose remuneration is determined by the Executive
Directors) within the limits set by the Articles of Association and
based on independent surveys of fees paid to NEDs of similar
companies. The basic fee paid to the Chairman in the year was
 55,000, and the basic fees paid to the other NEDs in the year
were Dr Carter:  22,000; Mr Keen:  22,000; Dr Plischke:  22,000;
Mr Prince:  22,000; Sir Mark Richmond:  22,000 and Professor
Yl -Herttuala:  2,000. The NEDs receive further fees for
attendance at each Board meeting and for additional work
performed for the Company in respect of chairmanship or
membership of the Remuneration Committee, Audit Committee
and Nomination Committee. NEDs are not eligible to join the
Group's pension scheme.

Included in the preceding table are retained options held by Professor Yl -Herttuala over shares in Ark Therapeutics Limited, but, under
an agreement dated 12 July 2002 between Ark Therapeutics Limited, the Company and Professor Yl -Herttuala, on any exercise of these
options the Ark Therapeutics Limited shares subject to option shall be issued directly to the Company and the Company shall issue the
equivalent number of its shares to Professor Yl -Herttuala.
There have been no significant variations to the terms and conditions for share options (including under the LTIP) during the 
financial year.
The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 December 2007 was 93.75 pence and the range during the year was 93 to 152 pence.
