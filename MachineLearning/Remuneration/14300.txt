 Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the
Companies Act 1985 (the Act ). The report also meets the relevant
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and
describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to Directors'
remuneration in the Combined Code. As required by the Act, a
resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General
Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be
approved.
The Act requires the Auditors to report to the Company's members on
certain parts of the Directors' remuneration report and to state whether
in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Act. The report has therefore been divided into
separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration Committee
The Group has a Remuneration Committee (the Committee ) which 
the Company considers is constituted in accordance with the
recommendations of the Combined Code. The members of the
Committee during 2008 were Sir Mark Richmond, Dennis Turner,
Andrew Christie and Peter Keen (Chairman). Mr Christie was appointed
to the Committee with effect from the date of the Annual General
Meeting, 24 April 2008. Mr Turner resigned from the Committee on 
the same date.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest (other than
as shareholders or option holders), conflicts of interests arising from
cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board. No Director plays
a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
In considering the Directors' remuneration for the year, the Committee
consulted Dr Nigel Parker (CEO) and Martyn Williams (CFO) about its
proposals and reviewed executive compensation packages in the UK
biotech sector. The Committee also considered the recommendations 
of the Hay Group who reviewed all elements of remuneration for
executive management and senior corporate at the end of 2006. The
Committee also referred to a number of specialist studies on executive
remuneration, including the annual survey carried out by Hewitt New
Bridge Street Consultants LLP in the biotechnology sector.
Remuneration policy
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract,
motivate and retain senior management of the high calibre needed to
achieve the highest level of Group performance in accordance with the
best interests of shareholders. They comprise a mixture of performance-
related and non-performance-related remuneration. The performance
measurement of the Executive Directors and key members of senior
management and the determination of their annual remuneration
package are undertaken by the Committee. The remuneration of the
NEDs is determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles 
of Association. No changes in respect of the remuneration policy are
expected in the foreseeable future.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package for
Executive Directors and senior management:
> Basic annual salary and benefits;
> Annual bonus payments;
> Share option incentives; 
> Pension arrangements; and
> Long-term incentive plans 
The Group's policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of
the Executive Directors and senior management should be performance
related. As described below, Executive Directors may earn annual
incentive payments linked to a specified target percentage of their basic
salary together with the benefits of participation in share-based
incentive schemes. 
Basic salary
An Executive Director's basic salary is determined by the Committee at
the beginning of each year and, from time to time, when an individual
changes position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the
Committee considers the Group as a whole and relies on objective
research which gives up-to-date information on a comparator group 
of companies within the sector. Account is also taken of the individual
performance of each Executive against objectives set by the Committee
as well as the pay and conditions of all employees. Basic salaries were
reviewed in January 2008, with increases taking effect from 1 January
2008. Executive Directors' contracts of service which include details 
of remuneration will be available for inspection at the Annual 
General Meeting.
In addition to basic salary, the Executive Directors receive certain
benefits-in-kind, namely a car allowance and private medical insurance.
Annual bonus payments
The Group operates a performance-related bonus scheme for senior
management, including Executive Directors, linked to a specified target
percentage of their basic salary (Dr Nigel Parker: 50%, Martyn Williams:
40%). The Committee has the discretion to increase the above
percentages by up to one half for exceptional performance. Bonuses are
non-pensionable and, for the financial year 2008, the maximum bonus
paid was 17% of basic salary. Bonus payments are based on the
attainment of specific performance criteria which are directly related 
to defined strategic goals which have been approved by the Committee.
Those criteria are intended to be challenging and are structured so as 
to encourage and reward high levels of achievement consistent with
the interest of shareholders and the long-term objectives of the Group.

Share options
Options over ordinary shares have been granted to date under nine
share option plans:
> the Ark Therapeutics Limited 2001 Enterprise Management Incentive
Share Option Plan (the 2001 EMI Plan );
> the Ark Therapeutics Group Limited 2003 Enterprise Management
Incentive Share Option Plan (the 2003 EMI Plan , together with 
the 2001 EMI Plan, the EMI Plans );
> the Ark Therapeutics Limited Scavidin
 
Stand-alone Plan (the
Scavidin
 
Plan );
> the Ark Therapeutics Limited Share Option Plan (the Old 
Executive Plan ); 
> the Ark Therapeutics Group Unapproved Share Option Plan 
(the Unapproved Executive Plan ); 
> the Ark Therapeutics Group Approved Share Option Plan 
(the Approved Executive Plan ); 
> the Non-Executive Director Share Participation Plan (the NED Plan ); 
> the Ark Therapeutics Group Consultancy Share Option Plan 
(the Consultants' Plan ); and 
> the Ark Therapeutics Group 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan 
(the LTIP ).
No grants have been made in the period under the Old Executive Plan,
the EMI Plans, the Scavidin
 
or the NED Plan, nor will there be any
further grants under these plans in the future. Employees and Executive
Directors are eligible to participate in the Approved Executive Plan and
the Unapproved Executive Plan (together the Executive Plans ) and the
LTIP , the terms of which comply with guidelines and best practice
governing the grant of share-based incentives in a listed company, to
the extent to which the Board considers such practice to be appropriate
to the Group.
In the period under review, no share options were granted to NEDs
under the NED Plan. The NEDs hold options granted prior to the
Company's IPO or, in the case of Mr Prince, granted as part of his
recruitment package. The Company no longer grants share options
under the NED Plan.
NED options become exercisable to the extent vested, which is
dependent only on the NED remaining with the Company, and will 
vest as to one third annually on the first, second and third anniversary
of grant. The Board considers that the terms of the options do not in
any way affect the independent judgment of Sir Mark Richmond, 
Dr Wolfgang Plischke, David Prince, Peter Keen or Andrew Christie. 
In accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code, the
NEDs have agreed that they will not dispose of shares arising from the
exercise of options granted under the NED Plan since the Company's 
IPO for at least one year from the date their directorship terminates.
Professor Seppo Yl -Herttuala, a Non-Executive Director, was awarded
60,000 options in the year under the Consultants' Plan in respect of his
services to the Company as a consultant.
All outstanding options are over ordinary shares and any ordinary shares
issued or transferred in satisfaction of any option shall rank pari passu
with the then existing issued ordinary shares. Benefits under any of 
the share option plans or LTIP detailed below are not pensionable.
The vesting of share-based incentives under the Executive Plans, the
Consultants' Plan and the LTIP is determined by assessing performance
against a number of specific, externally verifiable corporate milestones,
the achievement of which over a three-year period determines whether
and to what extent options and LTIPs vest. The following milestones
were identified for the 2008 grant of options:
1 January 2008 - 31 December 2010
1. Launch of Cerepro
 
in Europe 15%
2. Approval of Cerepro
 
in the USA 15%
3. Complete enrolment into Trinam
 
Phase III study 20%
4. Secure at least one further ACE 
stroke deal subject to minimum 
cash receipt in the period 20%
5. File IND for three 
pre-clinical programmes before 
31 December 2009 20%
6. Achieve sustainable break-even 
point in wound care business 10%
The Remuneration Committee considers that the above milestones are
expected to be the key events to drive enhanced shareholder value.
Where an individual milestone is achieved before the end of the three
year period, the percentage of the total award attributed to that
particular milestone will vest as to performance but will not be
exercisable until the third anniversary of grant. For future awards, 
the milestones will be set at the time of grant to reflect the key 
value drivers of the business at that time.
To the extent vested at the end of the three year period from the date
of grant, options are exercisable for the rest of their ten-year life
without further test.
Under the original performance criteria of the Executive Plans, options
granted to executive management or senior corporate staff were
subject to a combination of cash flow management requirements 
and the achievement of certain comparative levels of Total Shareholder
Return (TSR ). Under the Consultants' Plan, TSR was previously the sole
performance criterion.
Prior to the Company's IPO (which occurred in March 2004), the
Executive Directors were also granted options under the terms of the
EMI Plans, the Old Executive Plan and the Unapproved Executive Plan.
The exercise of these options is not dependent upon performance
criteria. The exercise price of the options granted under the above
schemes is equal to the market value of the Company's shares at 
the time when the options were granted.
Outstanding options may become exercisable before their normal
exercise date in the event of a change of control of the Company, 
in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan. LTIP
Under the LTIP , awards take the form of  nil paid' options and are subject 
to the achievement of the same key milestones described above which, 
in the Board's judgement, will be the determinants and drivers of
shareholder value and delivery of which is the primary goal of
management. At the end of three years, commencing with the year 
in which the option was granted, the option is tested against the
performance criteria.
The Company's policy is to consider the grant of awards annually to
Executive Directors at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee
taking into account individual performance up to a maximum of two
times salary in any one year, inclusive of any LTIP awards. It is the
Company's policy to phase the grant of awards rather than to grant 
a single large award to any individual. No awards have been made 
to Executive Directors since 3 January 2007.
In 2008, the Board resolved not to make LTIP awards to those who are
eligible to benefit from funds made available to the Ark Therapeutics
Group Family Benefit Trust (the FBT ), as described below. 
Ark Therapeutics Family Benefit Trust (FBT )
In 2008 the Board resolved to make funds available to the trustee 
of the FBT, on the basis of the trustee's agreement to the Company's
request that the trustee would subscribe for shares in the Company at
market value, and transfer the shares to sub-funds. The transfers are to
remain conditional for three years from the date of the transfer, and will
then only become unconditional to the extent that the key milestones
described in the share options  section above are achieved. The Board
also resolved to treat any shares issued to the trustee of the FBT as
reducing the number of new shares that may be issued under the LTIP
and share option plans.
Accordingly, on 4 January 2008, the trustee of the FBT subscribed for
1,355,000 ordinary shares of 1 pence each in the Company. Of these,
630,000 shares have been conditionally appointed to a sub-fund whose
class of discretionary beneficiaries includes Dr Nigel Parker and 240,000
shares have been conditionally appointed to a sub-fund whose class 
of discretionary beneficiaries includes Martyn Williams. The balance 
of 485,000 shares have been appointed to sub-funds whose class of
discretionary beneficiaries does not include Directors of the Company.
Whilst ordinary shares are held within the Trust, the voting rights in
respect of those shares are exercisable by the trustees in accordance
with their fiduciary duties.
Pension arrangements
In the UK, all employees including Executive Directors are invited to
participate in the Group Personal Pension Plan, which is money-purchase
in nature. The only pensionable element of remuneration is basic salary.
During the year, the Group contributed 15% of basic salary to a Self
Invested Personal Pension scheme in the name of Martyn Williams and
17% of basic salary in respect of Nigel Parker to a retirement annuity
contract in which he participated prior to joining the Group. 
Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance, measured 
by TSR, compared with the performance of the comparator group of
companies in the sector also measured by TSR. This is relevant to the
Group's original performance criteria for options and LTIP awards as 
set out above. The comparator group was selected for this comparison
because it was the comparator group used by the Company to
determine to what extent options issued to Executive Directors and
senior managers will vest (under the previous performance criteria).

Directors' service contracts
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors should have contracts
with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of one year's notice.
This applies to the contracts of Dr Parker and Mr Williams, which were
effective 8 March 2004. Dr Parker is required to give twelve months'
notice of termination and Mr Williams six months. The Company can
make payment of basic salary in lieu of notice.
Non-Executive Directors 
All NEDs have specific terms of engagement (the re-appointment being
reviewed annually and being terminable on three months' notice by either
party) and their remuneration is determined by the Chairman of the Board
and the Executive Directors (save in the case of the Chairman of the Board,
whose remuneration is determined by the Executive Directors) within the
limits set by the Articles of Association and based on independent surveys
of fees paid to NEDs of similar companies. The basic fee paid to the
Chairman in the year was  60,000, and the basic fees paid to the other
NEDs in the year were Dr Carter:  9,021; Mr Christie:  17,146; Mr Keen:
 25,000; Dr Plischke:  25,000; Mr Prince:  25,000; Sir Mark Richmond:
 25,000 and Professor Yl -Herttuala:  2,000. The NEDs receive further fees

12 July 2002 between Ark Therapeutics Limited, the Company and Professor Yl -Herttuala, on any exercise of these options the Ark Therapeutics Limited
shares subject to option shall be issued directly to the Company and the Company shall issue the equivalent number of its shares to Professor Yl -Herttuala.
There have been no significant variations to the terms and conditions for share options (including under the LTIP) during the financial year.
The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 December 2008 was 39.25 pence and the range during the year was 33 to 95 pence.
