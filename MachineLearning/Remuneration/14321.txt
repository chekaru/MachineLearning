Directors' remuneration report
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the 
Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006 (the Act ).  
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board 
has applied the principles relating to Directors' remuneration in the 
Combined Code. As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the 
report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company 
at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the Auditors to report to the Company's members on 
certain parts of the Directors' remuneration report and to state whether 
in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Act. The report has therefore been divided into 
separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration Committee
The Group has a Remuneration Committee (the Committee ) 
which the Company considers is constituted in accordance with 
the recommendations of the Combined Code. The members of the 
Committee during 2009 were Sir Mark Richmond, Andrew Christie and 
Peter Keen (Chairman). 
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest (other than 
as shareholders or option holders), conflicts of interests arising from 
cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board. No Director 
plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
During the year the Committee met three times and the following 
items were discussed:
> Review the market competitiveness of the remuneration policy and 
the remuneration arrangements for the executive directors and 
other members of the Operating Board, ensuring these are in line 
with current investor guidelines and also take account of levels of 
remuneration elsewhere in the Group;
> Review the salary levels for the executive directors and other 
members of the Operating Board;
> Agree the bonus payable for the 2008 year and agree how the 
annual bonus plan will operate in 2009;
> Agree individual long term share awards for the 2009 year and 
the performance measures to apply to these;
> Approve the vesting levels of the 2006 long term awards;
> Discuss the retirement of the then Chairman, Dennis Turner; and
> Examine the impact of the proposed 50% tax rate and pension 
changes on executive remuneration.
In considering the Directors' remuneration for the year, the Committee 
consulted Dr Nigel Parker (CEO) and Martyn Williams (CFO) about its 
proposals and reviewed executive compensation packages in the UK 
biotech sector. The Committee also referred to a number of specialist 
studies on executive remuneration, including the annual survey carried 
out by Hewitt New Bridge Street Consultants LLP in the biotech sector.
Remuneration policy
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, 
motivate and retain senior management of the high calibre needed 
to achieve the highest level of Group performance in accordance 
with the best interests of shareholders. They comprise a mixture of 
performance-related and non-performance-related remuneration and 
are structured to deliver over the short, medium and longer term, with 
the balance becoming more long term and more highly performance 
related with seniority. The performance measurement of the 
Executive Directors and key members of senior management and the 
determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken 
by the Committee. The remuneration of the NEDs is determined by the 
Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association. No changes 
in respect of the remuneration policy are expected in the foreseeable 
future.
There are, currently, four main elements of the remuneration package 
for Executive Directors and senior management:
> Basic annual salary and benefits;
> Annual bonus payments; 
> Pension arrangements; and
> Long-term incentive plans. 
The Group's policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration 
of the Executive Directors and senior management should be 
performance related. As described below, Executive Directors may 
earn annual incentive payments linked to a specified target percentage 
of their basic salary together with the benefits of participation in 
share-based incentive schemes. Executive Directors' contracts of service 
which include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at 
the Annual General Meeting.
Basic salary
An Executive Director's basic salary is determined by the Committee at 
the beginning of each year and, from time to time, when an individual 
changes position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the 
Committee considers the Group as a whole and relies on objective 
research which gives up-to-date information on a comparator group 
of companies within the sector. Account is also taken of the individual 
performance of each Executive against objectives set by the Committee 
as well as the pay and conditions of all employees, including levels of 
increases applicable to other employees in the Group. Basic salaries 
were reviewed in January 2009 and, in light of the prevailing economic 
conditions, no increases in salary were awarded to Executive Directors.
In addition to basic salary, the Executive Directors receive certain 
benefits-in-kind, namely a car allowance and private medical insurance.
Annual bonus payments
The Group operates a performance-related bonus scheme for senior 
management, including Executive Directors, linked to a specified 
target percentage of their basic salary (Dr Nigel Parker: 50%, Martyn 
Williams: 40%). The Committee has the discretion to increase the 
above percentages by up to one half for exceptional performance. 
Bonus payments are based on the attainment of specific performance 
criteria which are directly related to defined strategic goals which have 
been approved by the Committee. Those criteria are intended to be 
challenging and are structured so as to encourage and reward high 
levels of achievement consistent with the interest of shareholders and 
the long-term objectives of the Group. Bonuses are non-pensionable 
and, for the financial year 2009, no bonuses were awarded to 
Executive Directors. 19
Ark Therapeutics Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Share options
Options over ordinary shares have been granted to date under nine 
share option plans:
> the Ark Therapeutics Limited 2001 Enterprise Management 
Incentive Share Option Plan (the 2001 EMI Plan );
> the Ark Therapeutics Group Limited 2003 Enterprise Management 
Incentive Share Option Plan (the 2003 EMI Plan , together with 
the 2001 EMI Plan, the EMI Plans );
> the Ark Therapeutics Limited Scavidin
 
 Stand-alone Plan (the 
Scavidin
 
 Plan );
> the Ark Therapeutics Limited Share Option Plan (the Old Executive 
Plan );
> the Ark Therapeutics Group Unapproved Share Option Plan (the 
Unapproved Executive Plan ): 
> the Ark Therapeutics Group Approved Share Option Plan (the 
Approved Executive Plan ); 
> the Non-Executive Director Share Participation Plan (the NED 
Plan ); 
> the Ark Therapeutics Group Consultancy Share Option Plan (the 
Consultants' Plan ); and 
> the Ark Therapeutics Group 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan (the 
LTIP ).
No grants have been made in the period under the Old Executive Plan, 
the EMI Plans, the Scavidin
 
 or the NED Plan, nor will there be any 
further grants under these plans in the future. Employees and Executive 
Directors are eligible to participate in the Approved Executive Plan and 
the Unapproved Executive Plan (together the Executive Plans ) and 
the LTIP, the terms of which comply with guidelines and best practice 
governing the grant of share-based incentives in a listed company, to 
the extent to which the Board considers such practice to be appropriate 
to the Group.
In the period under review, no share options were granted to NEDs 
under the NED Plan. The NEDs hold options granted prior to the 
Company's IPO or, in the case of Mr Prince, granted as part of his 
recruitment package. The Company no longer grants share options 
under the NED Plan.
NED options become exercisable to the extent vested, which is 
dependent only on the NED remaining with the Company, and will  
vest as to one third annually on the first, second and third anniversary 
of grant. The Board considers that the terms of the options do not in 
any way affect the independent judgment of Sir Mark Richmond,  
Dr Wolfgang Plischke, David Prince or Peter Keen. In accordance with 
the recommendations of the Combined Code, the NEDs have agreed 
that they will not dispose of shares arising from the exercise of options 
granted under the NED Plan since the Company's IPO for at least one 
year from the date their directorship terminates.
Professor Seppo Yl -Herttuala is a NED and Consultant to the Company. 
He has played a key role in the development of our gene-based 
medicines and continues to provide his world renowned expertise and 
contacts in gene expression technology as well as providing innovative 
product ideas and opportunities. He was awarded 350,000 options in 
the year under the Consultants' Plan in respect of his services to the 
Company as a Consultant.
All outstanding options are over ordinary shares and any ordinary 
shares issued or transferred in satisfaction of any option shall rank pari 
passu with the then existing issued ordinary shares. Benefits under any 
of the share option plans or LTIP detailed below are not pensionable.
The vesting of share-based incentives under the Executive Plans, the 
Consultants' Plan and the LTIP is determined by assessing performance 
against a number of specific, externally verifiable corporate milestones, 
the achievement of which over a three-year period determines 
whether and to what extent options and LTIPs vest. The following 
milestones were identified for the 2009 grant of options:
1 January 2009 - 31 December 2011
1. Achieve agreed Cerepro
 
 sales 
 targets in the EU in the period 20%
2. Launch or out-license Cerepro
 
 in 
 the USA 20%
3. Complete enrolment into Trinam
 
 
 Phase III study 5%
4. Trinam Phase III study meets primary 
 endpoint 15%
5.  Secure at least one further ACE stroke 
 deal subject to minimum cash receipt 
 in the period 20%
6. Progress at least one further programme 
 into Phase II 15%
7. Achieve agreed level of woundcare profits 
 in year ending 31 December 2011 5%
The Remuneration Committee considers that the above milestones 
are expected to be the key events to drive enhanced shareholder 
value. Where an individual milestone is achieved before the end of 
the three year period, the percentage of the total award attributed to 
that particular milestone will vest as to performance but will not be 
exercisable until the third anniversary of grant. For future awards, the 
milestones will be set at the time of grant to reflect the key value 
drivers of the business at that time.
To the extent vested at the end of the three year period from the  
date of grant, options are exercisable for the rest of their ten-year  
life without further test.
Under the original performance criteria of the Executive Plans,  
options granted to executive management or senior corporate staff 
were subject to a combination of cash flow management requirements  
and the achievement of certain comparative levels of Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR ). Under the Consultants' Plan, TSR was previously the  
sole performance criterion.
Prior to the Company's IPO (which occurred in March 2004), the 
Executive Directors were also granted options under the terms of the 
EMI Plans, the Old Executive Plan and the Unapproved Executive Plan. 
The exercise of these options is not dependent upon performance 
criteria. The exercise price of the options granted under the above 
schemes is equal to the market value of the Company's shares at  
the time when the options were granted. 
Outstanding options may become exercisable before their normal 
exercise date in the event of a change of control of the Company,  
in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan. Ark Therapeutics Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009

LTIP
Under the LTIP, awards take the form of  nil paid' options and are 
subject to the achievement of the same key milestones described 
above which, in the Board's judgement, will be the determinants and 
drivers of shareholder value and delivery of which is the primary goal 
of management. At the end of three years, commencing with the 
year in which the option was granted, the option is tested against the 
performance criteria.
The Company's policy is to consider the grant of awards annually to 
Executive Directors at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee 
taking into account individual performance up to a maximum of two 
times salary in any one year, inclusive of any LTIP awards. It is the 
Company's policy to phase the grant of awards rather than to grant a 
single large award to any individual. No awards have been made to 
Executive Directors since 3 January 2007.
Since 2008, the Board has resolved not to make LTIP awards to those 
who are eligible to benefit from funds made available to the Ark 
Therapeutics Group Family Benefit Trust (the FBT ), as described 
below. 
Ark Therapeutics Family Benefit Trust (FBT )
Since 2008 the Board has resolved to make funds available to the 
trustee of the FBT, on the basis of the trustee's agreement to the 
Company's request that the trustee would subscribe for shares in  
the Company at market value, and transfer the shares to sub-funds. 
The transfers are to remain conditional for three years from the date 
of the transfer, and will then only become unconditional to the extent 
that the key milestones described in the share options  section above 
are achieved. The Board also resolved to treat any shares issued to the 
trustee of the FBT as reducing the number of new shares that may be 
issued under the LTIP and share option plans.
Accordingly, on 5 January 2009, the trustee of the FBT subscribed for 
1,910,000 ordinary shares of 1 pence each in the Company. Of these, 
650,000 shares have been conditionally appointed to a sub-fund whose 
class of discretionary beneficiaries includes Dr Nigel Parker and 400,000 
shares have been conditionally appointed to a sub-fund whose class 
of discretionary beneficiaries includes Martyn Williams. The balance 
of 860,000 shares has been appointed to sub-funds whose class of 
discretionary beneficiaries does not include Directors of the Company. 
In addition, 150,000 shares which had originally been conditionally 
appointed to a sub-fund for the benefit of an employee who has 
subsequently left the Company's employment were re-appointed to  
a sub-fund whose class of discretionary beneficiaries includes Dr Nigel 
Parker. 
Whilst ordinary shares are held within the FBT, the voting rights in 
respect of those shares are exercisable by the trustees in accordance 
with their fiduciary duties.
Pension arrangements
In the UK, all employees including Executive Directors are invited 
to participate in the Group Personal Pension Plan, which is money-
purchase in nature. The only pensionable element of remuneration 
is basic salary. During the year, the Group contributed 15% of basic 
salary to a Self Invested Personal Pension scheme in the name of 
Martyn Williams and 17% of basic salary in respect of Nigel Parker to 
a retirement annuity contract in which he participated prior to joining 
the Group. 
Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance, measured 
by TSR, compared with the performance of the comparator group of 
companies in the sector also measured by TSR. This is relevant to the 
Group's original performance criteria for options and LTIP awards as 
set out above. The comparator group was selected for this comparison 
because it was the comparator group used by the Company to 
determine to what extent options issued to Executive Directors and 
senior managers will vest (under the previous performance criteria).

Directors' service contracts
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors should have contracts 
with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of one year's notice. 
This applies to the contracts of Dr Parker and Mr Williams, which were 
effective 8 March 2004. Dr Parker is required to give twelve months' 
notice of termination and Mr Williams six months. The Company can 
make payment of basic salary in lieu of notice.
Non-Executive Directors 
All NEDs have specific terms of engagement (the re-appointment being 
reviewed annually and being terminable on three months' notice by 
either party) and their remuneration is determined by the Chairman 
of the Board and the Executive Directors (save in the case of the 
Chairman of the Board, whose remuneration is determined by the 
Executive Directors) within the limits set by the Articles of Association 
and based on independent surveys of fees paid to NEDs of similar 
companies. The basic fees paid to the Chairman in the year were 
 42,500 to Mr Christie (including  30,000 for the six months from  
1 July 2009 following his appointment as Chairman) and  30,000  
to Mr Turner for the six months to 30 June 2009, the date of his 
retirement, and the basic fees paid to the other NEDs in the year were 
Mr Keen:  25,000; Dr Plischke:  25,000; Mr Prince:  25,000; Sir Mark 
Richmond:  25,000 and Professor Yl -Herttuala:  2,000. The NEDs 
receive further fees for attendance at each Board meeting and for 
additional work performed for the Company in respect of chairmanship 
or membership of the Remuneration Committee, Audit Committee 
and Nomination Committee. NEDs are not eligible to join the Group's 
pension scheme.
The details of the appointments of the NEDs who served as a Director
