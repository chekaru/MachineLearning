Directors' remuneration report
Directors' remuneration report
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 
8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies 
Act 2006 (the Act ). The report also meets the relevant 
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority and describes how the Board has applied the 
principles relating to Directors' remuneration in the 
Combined Code. As required by the Act, a resolution to 
approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements 
will be approved.
The Act requires the Auditors to report to the Company's 
members on certain parts of the Directors' remuneration 
report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of 
the report have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Act. The report has therefore been divided into separate 
sections for audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
 
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee 
(the Committee ) which the Company considers is 
constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the 
Combined Code. It determines and agrees with the Board 
the Company's policy and framework for the remuneration 
of executive directors and the Chairman, and determines 
the specific remuneration packages for each of the 
executive directors and other senior management, including 
basic salary, other benefits and any compensation payment.
The members of the Committee during 2010 were  
Sir Mark Richmond (until his resignation from the Board  
on 17 August 2010), Andrew Christie, Peter Keen 
(Chairman) and David Prince who was appointed to the 
Committee on 5 September 2010. 
None of the Committee members have any personal 
financial interest (other than as shareholders or option 
holders), conflicts of interests arising from cross-
directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the 
business. The Committee makes recommendations to the 
Board. No Director plays a part in any discussion about his 
own remuneration.
During the year the Committee met three times and the 
following items were discussed:
 Review the market competitiveness of the remuneration 
policy and the remuneration arrangements for the 
executive directors and other members of the Operating 
Board, ensuring these are in line with current investor 
guidelines and also take account of levels of remuneration 
elsewhere in the Group
 Review the salary levels for the Executive Directors and 
other members of the Operating Board
 Agree the bonus payable for the 2009 year and agree how 
the annual bonus plan will operate in 2010
 Approve the vesting levels of the 2007 long term awards
 Review the new fee structure for NEDs for approval to the 
Board
 Approve the remuneration package for Mr Iain Ross upon 
his appointment as Executive Chairman
 Approve the redundancy package for UK staff on the 
restructuring
In considering the Directors' remuneration for the year, 
where appropriate, the Committee consults with the Chief 
Executive Officer about its proposals and reviews executive 
compensation packages in the UK biotech sector. The 
Committee also referred to a number of specialist studies 
on executive remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The executive remuneration packages are designed to 
attract, motivate and retain senior management of an 
appropriate calibre needed to achieve the Group's strategic 
objectives. They comprise a mixture of performance-
related and non-performance-related remuneration and 
are structured to deliver over the short, medium and 
longer term, with the balance becoming more long term 
and performance related with seniority. The performance 
measurement of the Executive Directors and key members 
of senior management and the determination of their 
annual remuneration package are undertaken by the 
Committee. The remuneration of the NEDs is determined 
by the Board within limits set out in the Company's Articles 
of Association. No changes in respect of the remuneration 
policy are expected in the foreseeable future.
There are, currently, four main elements of the remuneration 
package for Executive Directors and senior management:
 Basic annual salary and benefits;
 Annual bonus payments; 
 Pension arrangements; and
 Long-term incentive plans 
The Group's policy is that a substantial proportion of 
the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior 
management should be performance related. As described 
below, Executive Directors may earn annual incentive 
payments linked to a specified target percentage of their 
basic salary together with the benefits of participation in 
share-based incentive schemes. It is expected that the basis 
for awarding these incentives will not change in the coming 
year, unless such a change is deemed appropriate. Executive 
Directors' contracts of service which include details of 
remuneration will be available for inspection at the Annual 
General Meeting.
Basic salary
An Executive Director's basic salary is determined by the 
Committee at the beginning of each year and, from time to 
time, when an individual changes position or responsibility. 
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the 
Group as a whole and relies on objective research which gives 
up-to-date information on a comparator group of companies 
within the sector. Account is also taken of the individual 
performance of each Executive against objectives set by the 
Committee as well as the pay and conditions of all employees, 
including levels of increases applicable to other employees in 
the Group. Basic salaries were reviewed in January 2010 and, 
in light of the prevailing economic conditions, Dr Parker and 
Mr Williams agreed to a 15% reduction in basic salary for the 
six month period ending 30 June 2010. Upon his appointment 
to CEO on 5 May 2010, Mr Williams' salary was increased. Mr 
Ross was appointed as Executive Chairman on 9 September 
2010 and his basic remuneration was agreed following 
consultations with external advisors. 
In addition to basic salary, the Executive Directors receive 
certain benefits-in-kind, namely a car allowance and private 
medical insurance. The Executive Chairman, Mr Ross 
receives no benefits-in-kind. 20

Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Directors' remuneration report
Annual bonus payments
The Group operates a performance-related bonus scheme for 
senior management, including Executive Directors, linked to 
a specified target percentage of their basic salary (Dr Nigel 
Parker: 50% until his resignation from the Board in May 2010, 
Martyn Williams: 40%, which was increased to 50% following 
his promotion to CEO. The Committee has the discretion to 
increase Mr Williams' bonus percentage by up to a further 
25% of salary for exceptional performance). Mr Ross does not 
have a specified bonus target percentage linked to his basic 
salary and the Board may at its absolute discretion award Mr 
Ross a bonus payment of such amount as the Remuneration 
Committee may determine from time to time. Bonus payments 
are based on the attainment of specific performance criteria 
which are directly related to defined strategic goals which have 
been approved by the Committee. Those criteria are intended 
to be challenging and are structured so as to encourage 
and reward high levels of achievement consistent with the 
interest of shareholders and the long-term objectives of the 
Group. Bonuses are non-pensionable. The potential approval 
of Cerepro
 
 was a significant event for the Company which 
would have materially impacted the strategic direction of the 
business. As an exception to the normal policy, in 2010 the 
Committee concluded that the majority of performance related 
remuneration would, therefore, be related to this one event. 
For the financial year 2010, no bonuses were awarded to 
Executive Directors.
Share options
Options over ordinary shares have been granted to date 
under nine share option plans:
 the Ark Therapeutics Limited 2001 Enterprise 
Management Incentive Share Option Plan (the 2001 EMI 
Plan );
 the Ark Therapeutics Group Limited 2003 Enterprise 
Management Incentive Share Option Plan (the 2003 EMI 
Plan , together with the 2001 EMI Plan, the EMI Plans );
 the Ark Therapeutics Limited Scavidin
 
 Stand-alone Plan 
(the Scavidin
 
 Plan );
 the Ark Therapeutics Limited Share Option Plan (the Old 
Executive Plan ); 
 the Ark Therapeutics Group Unapproved Share Option 
Plan (the Unapproved Executive Plan ); 
 the Ark Therapeutics Group Approved Share Option Plan 
(the Approved Executive Plan ); 
 the Non-Executive Director Share Participation Plan (the 
NED Plan ); 
 the Ark Therapeutics Group Consultancy Share Option 
Plan (the Consultants' Plan ); and 
 the Ark Therapeutics Group 2005 Long Term Incentive 
Plan (the LTIP ).
No grants have been made in the period under the Old 
Executive Plan, the EMI Plans, the Scavidin
 
 or the NED 
Plan, nor will there be any further grants under these plans 
in the future. Employees and Executive Directors are eligible 
to participate in the Approved Executive Plan and the 
Unapproved Executive Plan (together the Executive Plans ) 
and the LTIP, the terms of which comply with guidelines and 
best practice governing the grant of share-based incentives in 
a listed company, to the extent to which the Board considers 
such practice to be appropriate to the Group.
In the period under review, no share options were granted to 
NEDs under the NED Plan. The NEDs hold options granted 
prior to the Company's IPO or, in the case of Mr Prince, 
granted as part of his recruitment package. The Company  
no longer grants share options under the NED Plan.
NED options become exercisable to the extent vested, which 
is dependent only on the NED remaining with the Company, 
and will vest as to one third annually on the first, second 
and third anniversary of grant. The Board considers that the 
terms of the options do not in any way affect the independent 
judgment of David Prince or Peter Keen, nor did they affect 
the independent judgment of Sir Mark Richmond and Dr 
Wolfgang Plischke during the period they served as Directors 
during 2010. In accordance with the recommendations of 
the Combined Code, the NEDs have agreed that they will not 
dispose of shares arising from the exercise of options granted 
under the NED Plan since the Company's IPO for at least one 
year from the date their directorship terminates.
Professor Seppo Yl -Herttuala is a NED and Consultant to 
the Company. He has played a key role in the development 
of our gene-based medicines and continues to provide his 
world renowned expertise and contacts in gene expression 
technology as well as providing innovative product ideas 
and opportunities. He was awarded 150,000 options in the 
year under the Consultants' Plan in respect of his services 
to the Company as a Consultant. As these options were 
to vest on a successful conclusion to the Company's MAA 
filing in respect of Cerepro
 
, all have now lapsed. 
On 10 September 2010, following consultation with key 
shareholders, the Remuneration Committee awarded 
2,000,000 share options to the Executive Chairman, Iain 
Ross, on his joining the Board at an exercise price of 11.55 
pence, being twice the closing middle market price on the 
date of grant. The options will not be exercisable until at 
least two years from the date of issue. One twenty-fourth 
of the total number of shares subject to the option will 
vest at the end of each successive calendar month after 9 
September 2010 and until (and including) September 2012. 
As mentioned above, the potential approval of Cerepro
 
 
was a significant event for the Company which would 
have materially impacted the strategic direction of the 
business. As an exception to the normal policy, in 2010 
the Committee concluded that the majority of performance 
related remuneration would, therefore, be related to this 
one event. No share options were awarded to employees 
during the year.
All outstanding options are over ordinary shares and any 
ordinary shares issued or transferred in satisfaction of any 
option shall rank pari passu with the then existing issued 
ordinary shares. Benefits under any of the share option 
plans or LTIP detailed below are not pensionable.
The vesting of share-based incentives under the Executive 
Plans, the Consultants' Plan and the LTIP is determined 
by assessing performance against a number of specific, 
externally verifiable corporate milestones linked to the 
Group's core business focus, the achievement of which over 
a three-year period determines whether and to what extent 
options and LTIPs vest.
 
The Remuneration Committee considers that milestones 
attached to option awards are expected to be the key 
events to drive enhanced shareholder value. Where an 
individual milestone is achieved before the end of the three 
year period, the percentage of the total award attributed 
to that particular milestone will vest as to performance but 
will not be exercisable until the third anniversary of grant.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 21
Directors' remuneration report
To the extent vested at the end of the three year period 
from the date of grant, options are exercisable for the rest 
of their ten-year life without further test.
Under the original performance criteria of the Executive Plans, 
options granted to executive management or senior corporate 
staff were subject to a combination of cash flow management 
requirements and the achievement of certain comparative levels 
of Total Shareholder Return (TSR ). Under the Consultants' 
Plan, TSR was previously the sole performance criterion.
Prior to the Company's IPO (which occurred in March 
2004), the Executive Directors were also granted options 
under the terms of the EMI Plans, the Old Executive Plan 
and the Unapproved Executive Plan. The exercise of these 
options is not dependent upon performance criteria. The 
exercise price of the options granted under the above 
schemes is equal to the market value of the Company's 
shares at the time when the options were granted. 
Outstanding options may become exercisable before their 
normal exercise date in the event of a change of control of the 
Company, in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan.
LTIP
Under the LTIP, awards take the form of  nil paid' options 
and are subject to the achievement of key milestones as 
described above which, in the Board's judgment, will be 
the determinants and drivers of shareholder value, and the 
delivery of which is the primary goal of management. At 
the end of three years, commencing with the year in which 
the option was granted, the option is tested against the 
performance criteria.
The Company's policy is to consider the grant of awards 
annually to Executive Directors at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee taking into account individual 
performance up to a maximum of two times salary in any 
one year, inclusive of any LTIP awards. It is the Company's 
policy to phase the grant of awards rather than to grant a 
single large award to any individual. No awards have been 
made to Executive Directors since 3 January 2007.
Since 2008, the Board has resolved not to make LTIP 
awards to those who are eligible to benefit from funds 
made available to the Ark Therapeutics Group Family 
Benefit Trust (the FBT ), as described below. 
Ark Therapeutics Family Benefit Trust (FBT )
Since 2008 the Board has resolved to make funds available 
to the trustee of the FBT, on the basis of the trustee's 
agreement to the Company's request that the trustee 
would subscribe for shares in the Company at market 
value, and transfer the shares to sub-funds. The transfers 
are to remain conditional for three years from the date of 
the transfer, and will then only become unconditional to 
the extent that the key milestones described in the share 
options  section above are achieved. The Board also 
resolved to treat any shares issued to the trustee of the FBT 
as reducing the number of new shares that may be issued 
under the LTIP and share option plans.
On 8 January 2010, the trustee of the FBT subscribed for 
1,640,000 ordinary shares of 1 pence each in the Company 
although none of those shares have been conditionally 
appointed to any sub-funds within the Trust as a result 
of the performance conditions not being met prior to the 
formal appointment having been completed.
Whilst ordinary shares are held within the Trust, the voting 
rights in respect of those shares are exercisable by the 
trustees in accordance with their fiduciary duties.
Pension arrangements
In the UK, all employees including Executive Directors are 
invited to participate in the Group Personal Pension Plan, 
which is money-purchase in nature. The only pensionable 
element of remuneration is basic salary. During the year, 
the Group contributed 15% of basic salary to a Self 
Invested Personal Pension scheme in the name of Martyn 
Williams. Mr Williams' contribution was increased to 
17% on his appointment as CEO, following Dr Parker's 
resignation from the Board on 5 May 2010. During the 
period of Dr Parker's employment with the Company in 
2010, 17% of basic salary was paid to a retirement annuity 
contract in which he participated prior to joining the Group. 
The Group does not make any contribution to any pension 
arrangement in respect of Mr Ross.

 Directors' service contracts
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors should 
have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a 
maximum of one year's notice. This applies to the contracts 
of Dr Parker (until his resignation from the Board on 5 May 
2010) and Mr Williams, both of whose contracts were effective 
8 March 2004, and Mr Ross' contract which was effective 
from 9 September 2010. Mr Williams and Mr Ross are 
both required to give six months' notice of resignation. The 
Company can make payment of basic salary in lieu of notice.
Non-Executive Directors 
All NEDs have specific terms of engagement (the 
re-appointment being reviewed annually and being 
terminable on three months' notice by either party) and 
their remuneration is determined by the Board and the 
Executive Directors within the limits set by the Articles 
of Association and based on independent surveys of fees 
paid to NEDs of similar companies. The basic fees paid to 
Mr Christie in the year were  53,000 (Mr Christie having 
stepped down from the role of Non-Executive Chairman on 
9 September 2010) and the basic fees paid to the other 
NEDs in the year were as follows: Mr Keen:  26,750;  
Dr Plischke:  16,667 (until the date of his retirement 
on 17 August 2010); Mr Prince:  26,750; Sir Mark 
Richmond:  16,667 (until the date of his retirement on 
17 August 2010) and Professor Yl -Herttuala:  2,000. 
Until 30 September 2010, the NEDs received further 
fees for attendance at each Board meeting and for 
additional work performed for the Company in respect 
of chairmanship or membership of the Remuneration 
Committee, Audit Committee and Nomination Committee. 
From 1 October 2010, NEDs now receive a basic annual 
fee, with no attendance allowance, and an additional annual 
fee of  4,000 for chairing the Remuneration and Audit 
Committees. NEDs are not eligible to join the Group's 
pension scheme.
The details of the appointments of the NEDs who served 
as a Director in the year to 31 December 2010 are
