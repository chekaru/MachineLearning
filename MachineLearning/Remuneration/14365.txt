Directors' remuneration report
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 
to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006 
(the Act ). The report also meets the relevant requirements 
of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and 
describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to 
Directors' remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the Code ). As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the 
report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the 
Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the Auditor to report to the Company's 
members on certain parts of the Directors' remuneration report 
and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report 
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Act. The 
report has therefore been divided into separate sections for 
audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee (the 
Remuneration Committee ) which the Company considers is 
constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the 
Code. It determines and agrees with the Board the Company's 
policy and framework for the remuneration of Executive Directors 
and the Chairman, and determines the specific remuneration 
packages for each of the Executive Directors and other senior 
management, including basic salary, other benefits and any 
compensation payment.
The members of the Remuneration Committee during 2011 were 
Andrew Christie (until his resignation from the Board on 9 March 
2011), David Prince, Peter Keen and David Bloxham who was 
appointed to the Remuneration Committee on 29 November 
2011. Peter Keen chaired the Remuneration Committee until 
12 March 2012 when he was succeeded in this role by David 
Bloxham.
None of the Remuneration Committee members has any personal 
financial interest (other than as shareholders or option holders), 
conflicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-
to-day involvement in running the business. The Remuneration 
Committee makes recommendations to the Board. No Director 
plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
During the year the Remuneration Committee met twice and the 
following items were discussed:
 	 Review	 the	 market	 competitiveness	 of	 the	 remuneration	
policy and the remuneration arrangements for the Executive 
Directors and other members of the senior management 
team, ensuring these are in line with current investor 
guidelines and also take account of levels of remuneration 
elsewhere in the Group;
 	 Review	 the	 salary	 levels	 for	 the	 Executive	 Directors	 and	 other	
members of the senior management team;
 	 Agree	 the	 bonus	 payable	 for	 the	 2011	 year	 and	 agree	 how	
the annual bonus plan would operate in 2011 and 2012;
 	 Approve	 the	 vesting	 levels	 of	 the	 2008	 and	 2009	 long	 term	
awards; and
 	 Approve	 the	 share	 option	 grant	 made	 on	 29	 March	 2011.
In considering the Directors' remuneration for the year, where 
appropriate, the Remuneration Committee consults with the 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer about its proposals and 
reviews executive compensation packages in the UK biotech 
sector. The Remuneration Committee also referred to a number 
of specialist studies on executive remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, 
motivate and retain senior management of an appropriate  
calibre needed to achieve the Group's strategic objectives.  
They comprise a mixture of performance-related and non-
performance-related remuneration and are structured to deliver 
over the short, medium and longer term, with the balance 
becoming more long term and performance related with seniority. 
The performance measurement of the Executive Directors and 
key members of senior management and the determination 
of their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the 
Remuneration Committee. The remuneration of the NEDs is 
determined by the Board within limits set out in the Company's 
articles of association. No changes in respect of the remuneration 
policy are expected in the foreseeable future.
There are, currently, four main elements of the remuneration 
package for Executive Directors and senior management:
 	 Basic	 annual	 salary	 and	 benefits;
 	 Annual	 bonus	 payments;	
 	 Pension	 arrangements;	 and
 	 Long-term	 incentive	 plans.	
The Group's policy is that a substantial proportion of the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior management 
should be performance related. As described below, Executive 
Directors may earn annual incentive payments linked to a 
specified target percentage of their basic salary together with  
the benefits of participation in share-based incentive schemes.  
It is expected that the basis for awarding these incentives will 
not change in the coming year, unless such a change is deemed 
appropriate. Executive Directors' contracts of service which 
include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at 
the Annual General Meeting.
Basic salary
An Executive Director's basic salary is determined by the 
Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each year and, 
from time to time, when an individual changes position or 
responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Remuneration 
Committee considers the Group as a whole and relies on 
objective research which gives up-to-date information on a 
comparator group of companies within the sector. Account 
is also taken of the individual performance of each Executive 
Director against objectives set by the Remuneration Committee 
as well as the pay and conditions of all employees, including 
levels of increases applicable to other employees in the Group. 
Basic salaries were reviewed in January 2011 and, in light of 
the prevailing economic conditions, no increases in salary were 
awarded to Executive Directors. 
In addition to basic salary, the Executive Directors receive certain 
benefits-in-kind, namely a car allowance and private medical 
insurance. With effect from 1 January 2012, car allowances have 
been consolidated into basic salary, reflecting current practice. 
The Chairman, Mr Ross, receives no benefits-in-kind.
Annual bonus payments
The Group operates a performance-related bonus scheme 
for senior management, including Executive Directors, linked 
to a specified target percentage of their basic salary. Martyn 
Williams' target bonus percentage is 50%. The Remuneration 
Committee has the discretion to increase Mr Williams' bonus 
percentage by up to a further 25% of salary for exceptional 
performance. Mr Ross does not have a specified bonus target 
percentage linked to his basic salary and the Board may at its 
absolute discretion award Mr Ross a bonus payment of such 
amount as the Remuneration Committee may determine from 
time to time. Bonus payments are based on the attainment of 
specific performance criteria which are directly related to defined  19
Ark Therapeutics Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
strategic goals which have been approved by the Remuneration 
Committee. 
Those criteria are intended to be challenging and are structured 
so as to encourage and reward high levels of achievement 
consistent with the interest of shareholders and the long-term 
objectives of the Group. For 2011, bonuses were linked directly 
to cash generation objectives in the period. These objectives 
were exceeded and, with the cash position of the Company 
strengthened considerably, bonus payments were awarded to 
those key members of staff who had contributed to this success. 
Bonuses are non-pensionable and for the financial year 2011 the 
maximum bonus paid was 26% of basic salary. 
In 2011, the NEDs agreed that, during a period of transformation, 
the Company was potentially vulnerable to third party 
approaches. As a consequence and in order to incentivise its 
senior management to assess and, where appropriate, maximise 
the benefits of any such approach, a transaction bonus pool 
of up to  300,000 should be set aside to be allocated at the 
sole discretion of the NEDs in the event that the Ark Board 
recommends, and shareholders accept, an offer leading to a 
change of control of the Company. Accordingly, the employment 
contracts of certain members of the senior management team 
were amended to include eligibility for a discretionary transaction 
bonus. Mr Williams and Mr Ross were both included in this 
arrangement and each of their service agreements was amended 
to reflect their eligibility for a discretionary transaction bonus of up 
to a maximum of  100,000 each, on the terms described above. 
This arrangement is to be reviewed along with other components 
of the remuneration packages for senior management by the 
Remuneration Committee in the first quarter of 2012.
Share options
Options over ordinary shares are currently available to be granted 
under four option plans:
 	 the	 Ark	 Therapeutics	 Group	 Unapproved	 Share	 Option	 Plan	
(the Unapproved Executive Plan ); 
 	 the	 Ark	 Therapeutics	 Group	 Approved	 Share	 Option	 Plan	 
(the Approved Executive Plan ); 
 	 the	 Ark	 Therapeutics	 Group	 Consultancy	 Share	 Option	 Plan	
(the Consultants' Plan ); and 
 	 the	 Ark	 Therapeutics	 Group	 2005	 Long	 Term	 Incentive	 Plan	
(the LTIP ).
Employees and Executive Directors are eligible to participate in 
the Approved Executive Plan and the Unapproved Executive Plan 
(together the Executive Plans ) and the LTIP, the terms of which 
comply with guidelines and best practice governing the grant 
of share-based incentives in a listed company, to the extent to 
which the Board considers such practice to be appropriate to the 
Group.
Share options have also been granted in the past under five other 
plans:
 	 the	 Ark	 Therapeutics	 Limited	 2001	 Enterprise	 Management	
Incentive Share Option Plan (the 2001 EMI Plan );
 	 the	 Ark	 Therapeutics	 Group	 Limited	 2003	 Enterprise	
Management Incentive Share Option Plan (the 2003 EMI 
Plan , together with the 2001 EMI Plan, the EMI Plans );
 	 the	 Ark	 Therapeutics	 Limited	 Scavidin
 
 Stand-alone Plan 
(the Scavidin
 
 Plan );
 	 the	 Ark	 Therapeutics	 Limited	 Share	 Option	 Plan	 (the	 Old	
Executive Plan ); and 
 	 the	 Non-Executive	 Director	 Share	 Participation	 Plan	 (the	 NED	
Plan ). 
No grants under these plans have been made in the period, nor 
will there be any further grants under these plans in the future.
The NEDs hold options granted prior to the Company's IPO 
or, in the case of Mr Prince, granted as part of his recruitment 
package. The Company no longer grants share options under the 
NED Plan.
NED options become exercisable to the extent vested, which 
is dependent only on the NED remaining with the Company, 
and will vest as to one third annually on the first, second 
and third anniversary of grant. The Board considers that the 
terms of the options do not in any way affect the independent 
judgment of David Prince or Peter Keen. In accordance with the 
recommendations of the Code, the NEDs have agreed that they 
will not dispose of shares arising from the exercise of options 
granted under the NED Plan since the Company's IPO for at least 
one year from the date their directorship terminates. 
Professor Seppo Yl -Herttuala is a NED and Consultant to 
the Company. He has played a key role in the development of 
our gene-based medicines and continues to provide his world 
renowned expertise and contacts in gene expression technology 
as well as providing innovative product ideas and opportunities. 
Professor Yl -Herttuala holds a number of share options as 
detailed below but no additional share options were awarded to 
him in the year under review. 
Short term, cash-generating objectives for the Company 
were put in place at the end of 2010, including the sale of the 
woundcare business and the signing of third party manufacturing 
agreements. To provide an incentive to key personnel to achieve 
not only these short-term objectives but also longer term success 
which would translate into enhanced shareholder value, share 
options were awarded in the period to these employees. Those 
options will vest in three equal instalments on the first, second 
and third anniversaries of the date of grant but will not be 
exercisable until 24 months after the date of grant and have an 
exercise price of 10p, compared with a market price on the date 
of issue of 3.8p. No performance conditions were attached to the 
option grant.
All outstanding options are over ordinary shares and any ordinary 
shares issued or transferred in satisfaction of any option shall 
rank pari passu with the then existing issued ordinary shares. 
Benefits under any of the share option plans or LTIP detailed 
below are not pensionable.
The vesting of certain share-based incentives under the Executive 
Plans, the Consultants' Plan and the LTIP is determined by 
assessing performance against a number of specific, externally 
verifiable corporate milestones linked to the Group's core 
business focus, the achievement of which over a three-year period 
determines whether and to what extent options and LTIPs vest. 
The Remuneration Committee considers that where milestones 
are attached to option awards these are expected to be the key 
events to drive enhanced shareholder value. Where an individual 
milestone is achieved before the end of the three year period, 
the percentage of the total award attributed to that particular 
milestone will vest as to performance but will not be exercisable 
until the third anniversary of grant. 
To the extent vested at the end of the three year period from the 
date of grant, options are exercisable for the rest of their ten-year 
life without further test.
Under the original performance criteria of the Executive Plans, 
options granted to executive management or senior corporate 
staff were subject to a combination of cash flow management  Ark Therapeutics Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
20
Directors' remuneration report
continued
requirements and the achievement of certain comparative levels 
of Total Shareholder Return (TSR ). Under the Consultants' Plan, 
TSR was previously the sole performance criterion.
Prior to the Company's IPO (which occurred in March 2004), the 
Executive Directors were also granted options under the terms 
of the EMI Plans, the Old Executive Plan and the Unapproved 
Executive Plan. The exercise of these options is not dependent 
upon performance criteria. The exercise price of the options 
granted under the above schemes is equal to the market value 
of the Company's shares at the time when the options were 
granted. 
Outstanding options may become exercisable before their normal 
exercise date in the event of a change of control of the Company, 
in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan.
LTIP
Under the LTIP, awards take the form of  nil paid' options and 
are subject to the achievement of key milestones as described 
above which, in the Board's judgment, will be the determinants 
and drivers of shareholder value, and the delivery of which is 
the primary goal of management. At the end of three years, 
commencing with the year in which the option was granted,  
the option is tested against the performance criteria.
The Company's policy is to consider the grant of awards annually 
to Executive Directors at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee taking into account individual performance up to a 
maximum of two times salary in any one year, inclusive of any 
LTIP awards. It is the Company's policy to phase the grant of 
awards rather than to grant a single large award to any individual. 
No LTIP awards have been made to Executive Directors since  
3 January 2007.
Since 2008, the Board has resolved not to make LTIP awards to 
those who are eligible to benefit from funds made available to the 
Ark Therapeutics Group Family Benefit Trust, as described below. 
Ark Therapeutics Family Benefit Trust (FBT )
Since 2008 the Board has resolved to make funds available to 
the trustee of the FBT, on the basis of the trustee's agreement 
to the Company's request that the trustee would subscribe for 
shares in the Company at market value, and transfer the shares 
to sub-funds. The transfers are to remain conditional for three 
years from the date of the transfer, and will then only become 
unconditional to the extent that the key milestones described in 
the share options  section above are achieved. The Board also 
resolved to treat any shares issued to the trustee of the FBT as 
reducing the number of new shares that may be issued under  
the LTIP and share option plans. No funds were made available 
to the trustee of the FBT to subscribe for shares during the year.

Whilst ordinary shares are held within the FBT, the voting rights 
in respect of those shares are exercisable by the trustee in 
accordance with its fiduciary duties.
Pension arrangements
In the UK, all employees including Executive Directors are  
invited to participate in the Group Personal Pension Plan,  
which is money-purchase in nature. The only pensionable 
element of remuneration is basic salary. During the year, the 
Group contributed 17% of basic salary to a Self Invested 
Personal Pension scheme in the name of Martyn Williams and 
11% of basic salary to a Self Invested Personal Pension scheme 
in the name of Iain Ross. 
Directors' service contracts
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors should have 
contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of 
one year's notice. This applies to the contracts of Mr Williams 
and Mr Ross whose contracts were effective 8 March 2004 and 
9 September 2010 respectively. Mr Williams is required to give 
six months' notice of resignation and Mr Ross 12 months. The 
Company can make payment of basic salary in lieu of notice.
Non-Executive Directors 
All NEDs have specific terms of engagement (their re-appointment 
being reviewed annually and being terminable on three months' 
notice by either party) and their remuneration is determined by 
the Board and the Executive Directors within the limits set by  
the articles of association and based on independent surveys  
of fees paid to NEDs of similar companies. The basic fees  
paid to NEDs in the year were as follows: Mr Christie:  4,837 
(Mr Christie having resigned from the Board on 9 March 2011); 
Mr Keen:  36,000 including an additional annual fee of  4,000 
for chairing the Remuneration Committee; Mr Prince:  36,000 
including an additional annual fee of  4,000 for chairing the Audit 
Committee; Dr Bloxham:  26,666 (who was appointed to the 
Board on 1 March 2011) and Professor Yl -Herttuala:  2,000. 
NEDs are not eligible to join the Group's pension scheme.
The details of the appointments of the NEDs who served as a 
Director in the year to 31 December 2011 are summarised in the 
table below:
