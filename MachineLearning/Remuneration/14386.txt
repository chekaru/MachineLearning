Directors' remuneration report 
 
Introduction 
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the 
Companies Act 2006 (the Act).  The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to 
Directors' remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code ).  As required by the Act, a 
resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at 
which the financial statements will be approved. 
The Act requires the Auditor to report to the Company's members on certain parts of the Directors' 
remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Act.  The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for 
audited and unaudited information. 
As of 1 April 2013 following the post period disposal of the operating subsidiaries the Group has no 
permanent employees and the remuneration policies listed below apply to the year ended 31 December 
2012 and to the part of the current year when the Group retained employees.  If the Group takes on 
permanent employees in the future, these policies will be revised and developed by the Remuneration 
Committee as appropriate.  
UNAUDITED INFORMATION 
Remuneration Committee 
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee (the Remuneration Committee ), which the 
Company considers is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Code.  It determines 
and agrees with the Board the Company's policy and framework for the remuneration of Executive 
Directors and the Chairman, and determines the specific remuneration packages for each of the 
Executive Directors and other senior management, including basic salary, other benefits and any 
compensation payment. 
The members of the Remuneration Committee during 2012 were Peter Keen (until his resignation from 
the Board on 17 May 2012), David Prince, David Bloxham and Charles Spicer who was appointed to the 
Remuneration Committee on 12 March 2012. Peter Keen chaired the Remuneration Committee until 12 
March 2012 at which time he was succeeded in this role by David Bloxham. 
None of the Remuneration Committee members has any personal financial interest (other than as 
shareholders or option holders), conflicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day 
involvement in running the business.  The Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the 
Board.  No Director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration. 
During the year the Remuneration Committee met three times and the following items were discussed: 
 Review the market competitiveness of the remuneration policy and the remuneration arrangements 
for the Executive Directors and other members of the senior management team, ensuring these are 
in line with current investor guidelines and also take account of levels of remuneration elsewhere in 
the Group; 
 Review the salary levels for the Executive Directors and other members of the senior management 
team; 
 Agree how the annual bonus plan would operate in 2012; 
 Approve the share option grants made on 17 April 2012 and 11 June 2012.  21 
 
 
In considering the Directors' remuneration for the year, where appropriate, the Remuneration 
Committee consults with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer about its proposals and reviews 
executive compensation packages in the UK biotech sector.  The Remuneration Committee also referred 
to a number of specialist studies on executive remuneration. 
Remuneration policy 
The executive remuneration packages in place during the period were designed to attract, motivate and 
retain senior management of an appropriate calibre needed to achieve the Group's strategic objectives.  
They comprise a mixture of performance-related and non-performance-related remuneration and were 
structured to deliver over the short, medium and longer term, with the balance becoming more long 
term and performance related with seniority. The performance measurement of the Executive Directors 
and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration packages 
are undertaken by the Remuneration Committee.  The remuneration of the NEDs is determined by the 
Board within limits set out in the Company's articles of association.   
During the period there were four main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors 
and senior management: 
 Basic annual salary and benefits; 
 Annual bonus payments;  
 Pension arrangements; and 
 Long-term incentive plans.  
The Group's policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of Executive Directors and senior 
management should be performance related.  As described below, Executive Directors may earn annual 
incentive payments linked to a specified target percentage of their basic salary together with the 
benefits of participation in share-based incentive schemes. The Executive Directors' contracts of service, 
which include details of remuneration, which were in place during the period will be available for 
inspection at the Annual General Meeting. 
Basic salary 
An Executive Director's basic salary is determined by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of 
each year and, from time to time, when an individual changes position or responsibility.  In deciding 
appropriate levels, the Remuneration Committee considers the Group as a whole and relies on objective 
research, which gives up-to-date information on a comparator group of companies within the sector.  
Account is also taken of the individual performance of each Executive Director against objectives set by 
the Remuneration Committee as well as the pay and conditions of all employees, including levels of 
increases applicable to other employees in the Group. Basic salaries were reviewed in December 2011, 
with increases taking effect from 1 January 2012. Dr Venables' basic annual salary was increased from 
 170,000 to  200,000 upon his appointment as CEO on 1 August 2012 and Mr Ross' basic salary has 
not increased since the date of his appointment in 2010.  
In addition to basic salary, the Executive Directors received private medical insurance.  With effect from 
1 January 2012, car allowances have been consolidated into basic salary, reflecting current practice. 
Neither Dr Venables nor Mr Ross previously received a car allowance as part of their remuneration 
package. 
Annual bonus payments 
During the period the Group operated a performance-related bonus scheme for senior management, 
including Executive Directors, linked to a specified target percentage of their basic salary. Dr Venables 
was eligible to receive a bonus of up to 100% of his basic salary. Mr Ross did not have a specified 
bonus target percentage linked to his basic salary and the Board could have, at its absolute discretion,  22 
 
 
awarded Mr Ross a bonus payment of such amount as the Remuneration Committee may have 
determined from time to time. Martyn Williams' target bonus percentage was 50%.  The Remuneration 
Committee had the discretion to increase Mr Williams' bonus percentage by up to a further 25% of 
salary for exceptional performance.  Bonus payments are based on the attainment of specific 
performance criteria, which are directly related to defined strategic goals, which have been approved by 
the Remuneration Committee.  Those criteria are intended to be challenging and are structured so as to 
encourage and reward high levels of achievement consistent with the interest of shareholders and the 
long-term objectives of the Group. Bonuses are non-pensionable.   
No bonuses were paid to the Executive Directors in respect of 2012 as the Company did not meet its 
objectives. 
Share options 
Options over ordinary shares are currently available to be granted under three option plans: 
 the Ark Therapeutics Group Approved Share Option Plan (the Approved Executive Plan );  
 the Ark Therapeutics Group Consultancy Share Option Plan (the Consultants' Plan); and  
 the Ark Therapeutics Group 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan (the LTIP ). 
Employees and Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Approved Executive Plan and the 
LTIP, the terms of which comply with guidelines and best practice governing the grant of share-based 
incentives in a listed company, to the extent to which the Board considers such practice to be 
appropriate to the Group. 
Share options have also been granted in the past under six other plans: 
 the Ark Therapeutics Limited 2001 Enterprise Management Incentive Share Option Plan (the 2001 
EMI Plan); 
 the Ark Therapeutics Group Limited 2003 Enterprise Management Incentive Share Option Plan (the 
2003 EMI Plan , together with the 2001 EMI Plan, the EMI Plans); 
 the Ark Therapeutics Limited Scavidin  Stand-alone Plan (the Scavidin  Plan); 
 the Ark Therapeutics Limited Share Option Plan (the Old Executive Plan);  
 the Non-Executive Director Share Participation Plan (the NED Plan); and  
 the Ark Therapeutics Group Unapproved Share Option Plan (the Unapproved Executive Plan).  
No grants under these plans (other than under the Unapproved Executive Plan which expired on 17 
April 2012) have been made in the period, nor will there be any further grants under these plans in the 
future. 
The NEDs hold options granted prior to the Company's IPO or, in the case of Mr Prince, granted as part 
of his recruitment package. The Company no longer grants share options under the NED Plan. 
NED options become exercisable to the extent vested, which is dependent only on the NED remaining 
with the Company, and will vest as to one third annually on the first, second and third anniversary of 
grant.  The Board considers that the terms of the options do not in any way affect the independent 
judgment of David Prince or Peter Keen during the period he served on the Board in the reporting year. 
In accordance with the recommendations of the Code, the NEDs have agreed that they will not dispose 
of shares arising from the exercise of options granted under the NED Plan since the Company's IPO for 
at least one year from the date their directorship terminates.    23 
 
 
Professor Seppo Yl -Herttuala was a NED until his resignation from the Board post period on 15 March 
2013 and was a Consultant to the Company prior to such resignation.  Professor Yl -Herttuala holds a 
number of share options as detailed below but no additional share options were awarded to him in the 
year under review.   
During the period objectives for the Company were put in place, including the signing of third party 
manufacturing agreements and capital raising.  To provide an incentive to key personnel to achieve not 
only these but also longer term success which would have translated into enhanced shareholder value, 
share options were awarded in the period to certain employees.  Those options will vest in three equal 
instalments on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant but will not be exercisable 
until the share price has reached at least 7 pence, compared with a market price on the date of issue of 
3.5 pence.  No performance conditions were attached to the option grant. 
All outstanding options are over ordinary shares and any ordinary shares issued or transferred in 
satisfaction of any option shall rank pari passu with the then existing issued ordinary shares.  Benefits 
under any of the share option plans or LTIP detailed below are not pensionable. 
Historically, the vesting of certain share-based incentives under the Approved Executive and 
Unapproved Executive Plans, the Consultants' Plan and the LTIP was determined by assessing 
performance against a number of specific, externally verifiable corporate milestones linked to the 
Group's core business focus, the achievement of which over a three-year period determined whether 
and to what extent options and LTIPs vested.  The Remuneration Committee considered that where 
milestones were attached to option awards these were expected to be the key events to drive enhanced 
shareholder value.  To the extent vested at the end of the three year period from the date of grant, 
options are exercisable for the rest of their ten-year life without further test. 
Under the original performance criteria of the Approved Executive and Unapproved Executive Plans, 
options granted to executive management or senior corporate staff were subject to a combination of 
cash flow management requirements and the achievement of certain comparative levels of Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR).  Under the Consultants' Plan, TSR was previously the sole performance 
criterion. 
Prior to the Company's IPO (which occurred in March 2004), the Executive Directors were also granted 
options under the terms of the EMI Plans, the Old Executive Plan and the Unapproved Executive Plan.  
The exercise of these options is not dependent upon performance criteria.  The exercise price of the 
options granted under the above schemes was equal to the market value of the Company's shares at 
the time when the options were granted.   
Outstanding options may become exercisable before their normal exercise date in the event of a change 
of control of the Company, in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan. 
LTIP 
Under the LTIP, awards take the form of 'nil paid' options and are subject to the achievement of key 
milestones as described above which, in the Board's judgment, will be the determinants and drivers of 
shareholder value, and the delivery of which is the primary goal of management.  At the end of three 
years, commencing with the year in which the option was granted, the option is tested against the 
performance criteria. 
The Company's policy is to consider the grant of awards annually to Executive Directors at the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee taking into account individual performance up to a maximum 
of two times salary in any one year, inclusive of any LTIP awards.  It is the Company's policy to phase 
the grant of awards rather than to grant a single large award to any individual.  No LTIP awards have 
been made to Executive Directors since 3 January 2007. 
Since 2008, the Board has resolved not to make LTIP awards to those who are eligible to benefit from 
funds made available to the Ark Therapeutics Group Family Benefit Trust, as described below.    24 
 
 
Ark Therapeutics Family Benefit Trust (FBT ) 
Since 2008 the Board has resolved to make funds available to the trustee of the FBT, on the basis of 
the trustee's agreement to the Company's request that the trustee would subscribe for shares in the 
Company at market value, and transfer the shares to sub-funds.  The transfers are to remain 
conditional for three years from the date of the transfer, and will then only become unconditional to the 
extent that the key milestones described in the share options  section above are achieved. The Board 
also resolved to treat any shares issued to the trustee of the FBT as reducing the number of new shares 
that may be issued under the LTIP and share option plans.  No funds were made available to the 
trustee of the FBT to subscribe for shares during the year. 
Whilst ordinary shares are held within the FBT, the voting rights in respect of those shares are 
exercisable by the trustee in accordance with its fiduciary duties. 
Pension arrangements 
In the UK, all employees including Executive Directors are invited to participate in the Group Personal 
Pension Plan, which is money-purchase in nature. The only pensionable element of remuneration is 
basic salary. During the year, the Group contributed 15% of basic salary into the Group Personal 
Pension Plan in respect of Dr David Venables and 17% of basic salary to a Self Invested Personal 
Pension scheme in the name of Iain Ross. The Group contributed 17% of basic salary to a Self Invested 
Personal Pension scheme in the name of Martyn Williams together with a further one-off payment of 
 45,000 on his resignation as a Director on 31 July 2012.

Directors' service contracts 
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term 
providing for a maximum of one year's notice and the Company is able to make payment of basic salary 
in lieu of notice.  
Mr Williams' contract was effective 8 March 2004 and he was required to give six months' notice but 
was entitled to receive 12 months' notice.  In May 2010 the terms of Mr Williams' contract were revised 
by the Board on his appointment as CEO, prior to the arrival of any of the members of the current 
Board. He resigned as a Director on 31 July 2012.  
Mr Ross and Dr Venables whose contracts were effective 9 September 2011 and 16 April 2012 
respectively were required to give 12 months' notice of resignation.  Post period on 31 March 2013 both 
Mr Ross and Dr Venables' positions as Executive Directors were made redundant.  Mr Ross and Dr 
Venables were subsequently both appointed as Non-Executive Directors with effect from 1 April 2013.  
Non-Executive Directors  
During the period all NEDs had specific terms of engagement (their re-appointment being reviewed 
annually and being terminable on three months' notice by either party) and their remuneration was 
determined by the Board and the Executive Directors within the limits set by the articles of association 
and based on independent surveys of fees paid to NEDs of similar companies.  The basic fees paid to 
NEDs in the year were as follows:  Mr Keen:  13,793 including an additional annual fee of  1,533 for 
chairing the Remuneration Committee until 12 March 2012 (Mr Keen having resigned from the Board on 
17 May 2012); Mr Prince:  36,000 including an additional annual fee of  4,000 for chairing the Audit 
Committee; Dr Bloxham:  35,632 including an additional fee of  3,632 for chairing the Remuneration 
Committee from 12 March 2012; Charles Spicer:  25,634 (who was appointed to the Board on 12 
March 2012) and Professor Yl -Herttuala:  2,000.  NEDs are not eligible to join the Group's pension 
scheme. 
The details of the appointments of the NEDs who served as a Director in the year to 31 December 2012 
are summarised in the table below:
