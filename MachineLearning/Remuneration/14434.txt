Meeting on 24 January 2005.
Information not subject to audit
The committee
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee (the committee) is chaired
by the independent director Sir Richard Packer KCB. The other members of
the committee are the Chairman, Sir David Naish DL, and the independent
directors P E B Cawdron and G C Summerfield CBE. Sir Richard Packer
succeeded P E B Cawdron as Chairman on 21 January 2004. Each member
of the committee exercises an independent judgement and has no
potential conflict of interest. The committee met on 10 occasions during
the 18 month period.
On behalf of the board the committee reviews and approves the
remuneration, terms of service and other employment benefits for 
the executive directors and other senior staff. The committee aims to 
ensure that the company's executive directors are fairly and competitively
rewarded for their individual contributions to the company's overall
performance. The committee also determines the broad policy for 
executive remuneration within the company. The committee's terms 
of reference are available on the company's website.
The committee is advised on remuneration practice by its advisers, 
New Bridge Street Consultants, who also monitor the company's
performance against its comparator group for remuneration purposes. 
The committee also receives advice as necessary from the company's
advisers: Ashurst (solicitors) on procedural and contractual matters and 
CMS Cameron McKenna (solicitors) and Watson Wyatt (consultants) on
post-retirement benefits.
Remuneration policy
The policy, based on the considerations embodied in the Combined Code,
is to provide competitive remuneration packages thereby enabling the
company to attract and retain high calibre executives, while at the same
time ensuring that the interests of shareholders are protected. Incentive
awards are designed to encourage improvements in financial performance
and to align the interests of directors with those of shareholders.
In determining the level of remuneration the committee receives
independent advice from its retained external remuneration consultants 
and from other independent sources. The advice takes into account the
remuneration practices of a broad range of comparable companies. 
The committee reviews remuneration policy on a regular basis.
The remuneration opportunities for executive directors include basic salary
and benefits, an opportunity for an annual short term incentive, participation
in a long term incentive plan, pension benefits, and service contracts.
Basic salary and benefits
When establishing and reviewing the salaries and benefits of each 
executive director the committee takes account of relevant market 
pay practices, the individual's performance and the company's overall
performance. The relevant information in respect of each director is set 
out in the notes to this report.
Short term incentive plan (annual bonus)
The committee sets annual group incentive targets for executive directors
each year, which aim to enhance business performance and which take
account of current business plans and market expectations. No payment 
is made if the group's performance is less than 95 per cent of target. The
target incentive award for executive directors is 30 per cent of base salary.
Where performance is above target the incentive may increase up to a
maximum of 60 per cent of base salary. Two thirds of any payment is
normally made in cash and one-third as a conditional award in shares 
which are held in trust for two years and are not received if the individual
leaves the company in specified circumstances. Incentive payments are not
pensionable. The board has adopted a policy of extending the short term
incentive plan to a wider body of senior executives within the group at 
50 per cent of the level paid to executive directors.
Payments were awarded at 15 per cent for the executive directors and 
12.5 per cent for the senior executives for the six months to 30 September
2003 and at 48 per cent for the executive directors and 24 per cent for the
senior executives for the year ended 30 September 2004.
Long term incentive plan (LTIP)
The long term incentive plan (LTIP) established in 1998, which operates over
a three year cycle with a new cycle starting annually, is designed to align the
long term interests of senior management with those of shareholders. The
LTIP is not Inland Revenue approved. The number of shares awarded to a
participant in the plan in any financial year is determined by the committee.
The existing arrangements are that the maximum market value of shares
which may be awarded to a participant in any new annual cycle will be
limited to 1 x prevailing base salary. This is kept under review by the
committee in light of market conditions.
Under the plan the committee awards shares in the company to the senior
management conditional on the achievement of a corporate performance
target over a period of three years. The performance target is determined 
by the committee, on the advice of New Bridge Street Consultants, as 
being appropriate for the company's size and sector. It requires the
company's T otal Shareholder Return (TSR) over the performance cycle, based
on movement in the share price and the gross value of dividends declared,
to be compared with the average TSR of a comparator peer group of food
producers over the same performance period. 
24 Arla Foods UK plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 
Remuneration report 25 Arla Foods UK plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 
The comparator group consists of the following companies in the FTSE Food
Producers Index.
A G Barr plc
Arla Foods UK plc
Associated British Foods PLC
Cadbury Schweppes plc
Dairy Crest Group plc
Devro PLC
Geest PLC
Linton Park PLC
Nichols plc
Northern Foods plc
Robert Wiseman Dairies PLC
Tate & Lyle PLC
Uniq plc
The current performance target requires the TSR, over the three year
performance cycle, to rank in the top quartile of the comparator companies
in order for participants in the plan to be entitled to all the shares
comprising the award. If the company's performance is ranked at 50 per
cent or lower no awards are made. Where the company is placed between
50 per cent and the top quartile the number of shares is calculated on a
straight line basis, with 33 per cent being received where the company is
placed at 51 per cent and all the award being received where the company
is placed in the top quartile. The TSRs are independently calculated by New
Bridge Street Consultants. Adjustments are made if necessary to allow for
changes in the comparator group. The committee has discretion to decide
whether the underlying performance of the company justifies an award
being made. In considering this the committee will have regard to the real
growth in the company's earnings per share over the performance period. 
If an award is not earned in accordance with the performance conditions
outlined above then it will lapse.
Shares awarded under the plan after the three year performance period 
are retained in trust on behalf of participants for a further two years. During
this period participants are entitled to receive any dividends payable on 
the shares and to instruct the trustee how to vote. At the end of this
retention period the shares are transferred to participants from the trust.
The present policy of the committee is that employees who receive awards
under the LTIP in any financial year will not be considered for grants of
options under the company share option plan.
Since the current financial year was extended by six months the 
committee, on 12 July 2004, granted awards such that the maximum
market value of shares was limited to 50 per cent of each participant's 
base salary. In addition, on 19 and 20 July 2004 respectively, the 
committee granted to R C N Davidson and T J Smith a special LTIP
amounting to 33 per cent of base salary on the occasion of them 
entering into new service contracts.
The interests of the executive directors in the LTIP awards made over the
last four years are set out on page 30. The award made on 12 July 2001
vested at 90 per cent in May 2004.

Share options
Replacement scheme
Following demerger in 1998, a new share option scheme was adopted 
by the company to replace the Northern Foods Executive Share Option
Scheme 1994. No change to that scheme has been made since then and
no retesting has taken place. The scheme is Inland Revenue approved.
There is also an unapproved element if options granted exceed Inland
Revenue limits. Both directors and other senior management may
participate in the scheme, as determined by the committee. In accordance
with the committee's policy, no share options were awarded to directors
during the period ended 30 September 2004.
Under the scheme, options to purchase the company's ordinary shares 
may be granted each year and are not subject to a discount. Individual
option grants to senior management during the period were calculated 
on a sliding scale relating to salary, reflecting individual performance and
potential impact on long term business results. All grants are made subject
to a performance condition, chosen on the basis of the company's size and
sector, which measures how the TSR of an ordinary share in the company
has performed over the three year performance period in comparison with
the TSR of the ordinary shares, of the companies in a comparator group
over the same period. The current performance target requires the TSR, 
over the three year performance period, to rank at median in the
comparator group in order for participants in the plan to be entitled to
exercise the shares comprising the award. The TSRs are independently
calculated by New Bridge Street Consultants. The committee must also 
be satisfied that the underlying performance of the company over the
performance period justifies any award being made.

companies in the FTSE Food Producers Index which is used as the
comparator group for the LTIP and set out on page 25.
No options were exercised during 2004, 2003, 2002 or 2001. 
Savings-related scheme
A savings-related share option scheme with Inland Revenue approval 
was also established in 1998 open to all eligible employees in the UK 
as either a three year plan or a five year plan. The three year plan matured
on 1 October 2001 and the five year plan on 1 October 2003. All options 
under the scheme lapsed no later than 1 April 2004. 
Company share option plan
In July 2004 the shareholders approved the Arla Foods UK plc 2004
Company Share Option Plan (CSOP). The CSOP was approved by the 
Inland Revenue on 30 September 2004. There is also an unapproved
element if options granted exceed Inland Revenue limits. Both directors 
and other senior management may participate in the CSOP, as determined
by the committee, subject to individual limitations. The CSOP is subject to
performance criteria relating to the growth in earnings per ordinary share
(EPS) over a performance period of three years measured against the
growth in the retail prices index. No awards under the CSOP were made 
in the period to 30 September 2004.
Share incentive plan
In July 2001 the shareholders approved a Share Incentive Plan, which 
came into operation in April 2004. The plan is open to all employees with
continuous service of six months. Three directors participate in the plan and
their interests are set out on page 28.
For the year 2004/5 the plan is offered on the basis of one matching 
share for one partnership share. The partnership shares are kept in trust 
for a minimum of three years. Otherwise the matching shares are forfeited.
Pensions
The company operates several pension schemes. Certain eligible employees
including R C N Davidson and T J Smith are members of the Express Ltd
defined benefit scheme. Other eligible employees are members of the 
Arla Foods Ltd defined benefit scheme. Employees who have joined the
company since a specified date (31 January 2002 for Express Ltd, 1 January
2002 for Arla Foods Ltd) including N D Peet and S D Stevens have been
eligible only to join a defined contribution or stakeholder pension plan.
Pensionable earnings are calculated on base salary only. The amount of
accrued pension for each director is set out on page 27 , together with
comparative amounts adjusted for inflation.
Service contracts
R C N Davidson and T J Smith have new service contracts with the company
which were entered into in July 2004. Each contract provides for one year's
notice except that this rises to 18 months in the special case of termination
by Arla Foods amba in the two years following October 2005. It is 
intended that N D Peet and S D Stevens will enter, in due course, into full
service contracts providing for one year's notice. The service contract of 
R C N Davidson expires on 21 July 2005 and that of T J Smith on 8 July
2005. As at 30 November 2004, the unexpired term of R C N Davidson's 
contract was 233 days and that of T J Smith's contract was 220 days.
The company's policy, to the extent consistent with its contractual
obligations, is to apply the principle of mitigation to any payments of
compensation on termination. The service contracts of R C N Davidson 
and T J Smith provide that no mitigation shall be applied in the
circumstance that either leaves the company as a result of termination of
the contract by Arla Foods amba in the two years following October 2005.
Compensation is calculated by reference to salary and benefits payable 
over the notice period. The LTIP and share option schemes each set out 
the rules to be followed on termination of employment, based on the
reason for termination in individual cases, and the annual incentive plan
where applicable accrues on a time basis.
R C N Davidson and T J Smith are non-executive directors of external
companies as disclosed on page 20. The company's practice is that the
individuals retain their fees. R C N Davidson received fees of  51,308 
and T J Smith received fees of  12,840.
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors are appointed for two years but may be eligible 
for reappointment. The remuneration fee of non-executive directors is
determined by the board as a whole but non-executive directors do not take
part in the discussion on their own remuneration. Non-executive directors do
not participate in the company's incentive plans or pension schemes.

Notes to the table
(1) The accrued pension as at 31 March 2003 includes an inflationary increase of 4.6% over the period to 30 September 2004.
(2) The company provides executive directors with a pension, which is payable at age 60, equal to two thirds base salary, reduced where service to age
60 is less than 20 years. Member contributions are 5% of base salary each year. Death in service cover is a lump sum of four times pensionable
earnings. On the death of a director, or a retired director, a spouse's pension of 50% would be payable.
(3) Early retirement may be granted with the consent of the company and the Trustees of the Express Pension Scheme from age 50 but benefits are
reduced by 4% pa for ages 50 up to 59 years. Once in payment, pensions are increased in line with price inflation up to a ceiling of 3% pa in respect
of pensionable service accrued to 31 March 1997 and price inflation up to a ceiling of 5% pa on service accrued thereafter. The Trustees, with the
consent of the company, have discretion to apply such greater increase, as they consider appropriate.
(4) The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 less directors' contributions.
(5) For T J Smith it is anticipated that his full entitlement as shown above will exceed the Inland Revenue maximum earnings cap for the Express Pension
Scheme. Funded and unfunded unapproved arrangements are in place to provide the balance of the total entitlements above the amount payable
from the Express Pension Scheme.
6) N D Peet and S D Stevens are members of defined contribution pension schemes. Employers' contributions of  21,000 and  13,029 respectively were
paid in the period. M S Christiansen received a pension allowance of  11,942 in the period.
