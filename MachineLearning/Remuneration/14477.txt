and pension benefits. It is the company's policy for executive directors to
have appropriate service contracts. Thus a significant proportion of the
total executive package is based on variable pay.
In reviewing the short and long-term incentive plans each year the
committee considers the operation of the schemes and reviews whether
the grant levels, performance criteria and other features remain
appropriate to the company's circumstances and prospects.
Basic salary and benefits
In establishing and reviewing the salaries and benefits for each executive
director and for other members of the executive the committee takes
account of relevant market pay practices, the individual's performance
and the company's overall performance. The relevant information in
respect of each director is set out in the notes to this report.
Short-term incentive plan (annual bonus)
The committee sets annual group incentive targets for executive 
directors each year, which aim to enhance business performance and
which take account of current business plans and market expectations.
The maximum available payment is made if the target is exceeded by 
15 per cent. No payment is made if the company's performance is less
than 98 per cent of the target. All details of the scheme are reviewed
each year. Incentive payments are not pensionable.
For the year 2006/07 the award for the executive directors and other
members of the executive for achieving the target is 50 per cent of base
salary (2005/06: 30 per cent). Where performance is above target the incentive
may increase up to a maximum, at 115 per cent of the target, of 100 per
cent of base salary (2005/06: 60 per cent). From 2006/07 one half of any
award is payable in cash and one half as a conditional award in shares. In
2005/06 one third of the award was available in shares. Shares awarded
under the scheme are held in trust for two years and are not received if the
individual leaves the company in specified circumstances. The committee has
adopted a policy of extending the short-term incentive plan to a wider group
of managers, currently at 40 per cent of the level paid to executive directors.
No payments under the plan were made in respect of the year ended 
30 September 2006.
Long-term incentive plan (LTIP)
A long-term incentive plan (LTIP) established in 1998, which operates over
a three-year cycle starting annually, is designed to align the long-term
interests of senior management with those of shareholders. The LTIP is
not approved by HM Revenue and Customs. The number of shares
awarded to a participant in the plan in any financial year is determined by
the committee. The existing arrangements are that the maximum value of
shares that may be awarded to a participant in any new cycle will be
limited to 1 x prevailing base salary. This is kept under review by the
committee in the light of market conditions. 
Under the plan the committee awards shares in the company to the
senior management conditional on the achievement of a corporate
performance target over a period of three years. The performance target
is determined by the committee, on the advice of New Bridge Street
Consultants, as being appropriate for the company's size and sector. It
requires the company's total shareholder return (TSR) over the
performance cycle, based on movement in the share price and the gross
value of dividends declared, to be compared with the average TSR of a
comparator peer group of food producers over the same performance
period. The TSR allows a direct comparison over an extended period of
time between the returns received by the company's shareholders and the
returns received by shareholders in other food companies in the
comparator group, thereby aligning the interests of the executive
directors with those of the company's shareholders.
Arla Foods UK plc Annual report and accounts 2006
Remuneration report information not subject to audit
The board presents its report to shareholders on the remuneration of the
directors and other members of the company' s executive for the year from 
1 October 2005 to 30 September 2006. Shareholders will be invited to
approve the report at the Annual General Meeting on 27 February 2007.
The committee
The Remuneration Committee (the committee) consists of three
independent non-executive directors. Sir Richard Packer KCB is Chairman.
The other members of the committee are G C Summerfield CBE and 
J A Warren. Mr Warren joined the committee on 22 March 2006 in
succession to P E B Cawdron, who resigned from the committee on 
24 January 2006. Each member of the committee exercises an
independent judgement and has no potential conflict of interest. The
committee met on five occasions during the year. Mr Warren was unable
to attend one meeting.
The performance of the committee was evaluated as part of the formal
board evaluation process. This process, which is supervised by the
Nomination Committee, takes place annually in the spring and involves 
all board members replying in confidence to a written questionnaire.
Individual views are not made known to the Nomination Committee.
On behalf of the board the committee reviews and approves the
remuneration, terms of service and other employment benefits for 
the executive directors and other members of the executive and the
arrangements for other senior managers. The committee aims to ensure
that the company's executive directors and senior managers are fairly
and competitively rewarded for their individual contributions to the
company's overall performance. The committee also determines the
broad policy for executive remuneration within the company. The
committee's terms of reference are reviewed annually and are available
on the company's website.
The committee is advised on remuneration practice by New Bridge Street
Consultants, who are engaged as advisers to the committee. New Bridge
Street monitors the company's performance against comparator groups,
which they select from food processors and other FTSE 250 companies 
of comparable size, and advises the company on a regular basis. The
committee also receives advice as required from the company's advisers:
Ashurst (solicitors) on procedural and contractual matters, Eversheds
(solicitors) on human resources matters and CMS Cameron McKenna
(solicitors), Mercers (consultant actuaries) and Watson Wyatt (consultant
actuaries) on post-retirement benefits.
Remuneration policy
The committee's policy, based on the considerations embodied in the
Combined Code, is to provide competitive remuneration packages thereby
enabling the company to attract and retain high calibre executives, while
at the same time ensuring that the interests of shareholders are protected.
Incentive awards are designed to encourage improvements in financial
performance and to align the interests of executive directors and senior
management with those of shareholders. The policy takes into account 
the company's total remuneration costs and employment conditions.
In determining the level of remuneration the committee receives
independent advice from its retained external remuneration consultants
and from other independent sources. The policy takes into account the
remuneration practices of a broad range of comparable companies and
the views of shareholders. The committee reviews the remuneration 
policy on a regular basis. Salary rates are reviewed annually at 1 October.
The remuneration opportunities for executive directors and other members
of the executive include basic salary and benefits, an opportunity for an
annual short-term incentive, participation in a long-term incentive plan 30
Remuneration report continued
The comparator group currently consists of the following companies in
the FTSE Food Producers Index:
A G Barr plc Linton Park PLC
Arla Foods UK plc Nichols plc
Associated British Foods PLC Northern Foods plc
Cadbury Schweppes plc Robert Wiseman Dairies PLC
Dairy Crest Group plc Tate & Lyle PLC
Devro PLC Uniq plc
The current performance target requires the TSR, over the three-year
performance cycle, to rank in the top quartile of the comparator
companies in order for participants in the plan to be entitled to all the
shares comprising the award. If the company's performance is ranked at
50 per cent or lower no awards are made. Where the company is placed
between 50 per cent and the top quartile the number of shares is
calculated on a straight-line basis, with 33 per cent being received where
the company is placed at 51 per cent and all the award being received
where the company is placed in the top quartile. 
The TSRs are independently calculated by New Bridge Street Consultants
and participants receive regular reports on the company's comparative
position. Adjustments are made if necessary to allow for changes in the
comparator group. The committee has discretion to decide whether the
underlying performance of the company justifies an award being made.
In considering this the committee will have regard to the real growth in
the company's earnings per share over the performance period. If an
award is not earned in accordance with the performance conditions
outlined above then it will lapse. 
Shares awarded under the plan after the three-year performance period 
are at present purchased in the market and are retained in trust on behalf 
of the participants for a further two years. During this period participants 
are entitled to receive any dividends payable on the shares and to instruct
the trustee how to vote. At the end of this retention period the shares are
transferred to participants from the trust. 
The present policy of the committee, which is under review, is that
employees who receive awards under the LTIP in any financial year will not
be considered for grants of options under the company share option plan.
The interests of the executive directors in the LTIP awards made over the
last five years, including a conditional award made on 6 January 2006,
are set out on page 35. The award made on 11 July 2003 vested at 
100 per cent in May 2006.
The graph shows the value up to 30 September 2006 of  100 invested in
Arla Foods UK plc (formerly Express Dairies plc) compared with the value
of  100 invested in the FTSE All Share Index. The other points plotted are
the values at intervening financial year ends.
As at 30 September 2006 the 2004, 2005 and 2006 LTIPs granted over
the past three years, if at the end of their cycle, would vest at 0 per cent. 
Share options
Replacement scheme
This scheme was adopted to replace the Northern Foods Executive Share
Option Scheme 1994 following demerger from Northern Foods plc in
1998. The final options awarded under the scheme lapsed on 7 April
2005 and in accordance with the rules the scheme has been terminated.
Savings-related scheme
A savings-related share option scheme with Inland Revenue approval was
established in 1998 and was open to all eligible employees. All options
under the scheme lapsed no later than 1 April 2004 and no further grants
have been made. The committee does not intend to grant further options.
Company Share Option Plan
In July 2004 the shareholders approved the Arla Foods UK plc Company
Share Option Plan (CSOP). The CSOP was approved by HM Revenue and
Customs on 30 September 2004. There is also an unapproved element if
options granted exceed Revenue limits. Both directors and other senior
managers may participate in the CSOP , as determined by the committee,
subject to individual limitations. 
The CSOP is subject to performance criteria relating to the growth in
earnings per ordinary share (EPS) over a performance period of three
years measured against the growth in the retail price index (RPI). The
calculation is undertaken by New Bridge Street Consultants. EPS 
was chosen because it provides a measure of real improvement in the
company's financial performance and any grants made will be subject to
appropriate and challenging performance conditions. The current
intention is that options should not normally be exercisable in full unless
the company's normalised growth in EPS exceeds the growth in the RPI 
by at least seven per cent per annum compound over three years, with
partial exercise on a sliding scale being permitted where growth in EPS
exceeds growth in the RPI by at least three per cent per annum
compound over three years. No options will be exercisable if the
company's performance falls below this level. Under the scheme, the
exercise price of the share will not be lower than the price at which it was
granted. Subject to the performance conditions being achieved options
are exercisable between the third and the tenth anniversary of the date 
of grant. Shares awarded under the scheme will be issued by 
the company.
Awards were made under the CSOP on 6 January 2006. In accordance with
the committee' s current policy no grants were made to executive directors.
As at 30 September 2006, according to New Bridge Street Consultants, 
if it had been at the end of its performance period the CSOP would have
vested at 0 per cent.
The CSOP replaced a company share option plan approved in 1998 which
terminated in July 2004.
Share incentive plan
In July 2001 the shareholders approved a share incentive plan, which
came into operation in April 2004. The plan is open to all employees
with continuous service of six months. Three directors and four other
members of the executive participate in the plan and the interests of 
the directors are set out on page 34.

The plan allows the company to provide additional matching shares
when employees purchase partnership shares through regular
contributions from salary under the scheme, up to a maximum
permitted sum of  125 per month. For the year 2006/07 the plan is
offered on the basis of one matching share for two partnership shares.
The partnership shares are held in trust for a minimum of three years.
Otherwise the matching shares may be forfeited.
Pensions
The company's present policy is to provide executive directors with a
pension, which is payable at age 60. The company's contribution is 
20% and members' contribution is 6% each of the earnings cap. On 
the death of a director, or a retired director, a spouse's pension of 50%
would be payable. Death in service cover is a lump sum of four times
pensionable earnings. 
Specific arrangements for existing executive directors differ in some cases.
T J Smith and M J Gilbert are members of the Arla Foods UK Services Ltd
(formerly Express Ltd) defined benefit scheme while other eligible
employees are members of the Arla Foods Ltd defined benefit scheme.
Employees who have joined the company since a specified date (31
January 2002 for Arla Foods UK Services Ltd, 1 January 2002 for Arla
Foods Ltd) including N D Peet and S D Stevens have been eligible only to
join a defined contribution or stakeholder plan.
Pensionable earnings are calculated on base salary only. The amount of
accrued pension for each director is set out on page 33, together with
comparative amounts adjusted for inflation.
The company introduced certain simplifications and other modifications 
to the pension schemes with effect from 6 April 2006. In particular 
a pensionable salary cap was introduced based on the previous 
earnings cap. This is adjusted annually in line with movements in 
the retail prices index.
Service contracts
All the directors except T J Smith and N D Peet have entered into service
contracts with the company which provide for a rolling 12 months'
notice in the event of termination. Accordingly, the unexpired term as at
the date of the report is 12 months.
T J Smith entered into a new service contract with the company in 
July 2004. This provides for one year's notice except that this rises to 
18 months in the special case of termination by Arla Foods amba in the
two years following October 2005. On becoming Chief Executive, 
T J Smith agreed in principle to replace this with a service contract
providing for 12 months' notice in all circumstances, subject to
agreement between him, the company and Arla Foods amba. 
N D Peet continues to be employed on the basis of an offer letter dated
8 October 2002, which does not state a specific notice period.
All the senior managers of the company are employed under contracts
of employment which provide for notice periods which in no case
exceed 12 months.
The company's policy, to the extent consistent with its contractual
obligations, is to apply the principle of mitigation to any payments 
of compensation on termination. The service contract of T J Smith
provides that no mitigation shall be applied if he leaves the company as 
a result of termination of the contract.
Compensation is calculated by reference to salary and benefits payable
over the notice period. The LTIP scheme sets out the rules to be
followed on termination of employment, based upon the reason for
termination in individual cases, and the annual incentive plan where
applicable accrues on a time basis.
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors are appointed for two years but may be eligible
for reappointment. The remuneration fee for non-executive directors is
determined by the board as a whole, based on the time commitment,
but non-executive directors do not take part in the discussions on their
own remuneration. Non-executive directors do not participate in the
company's incentive plans, share schemes or pension schemes. 32

1 The accrued pension for T J Smith and M J Gilbert as at 30 September 2006 includes an inflationary increase of 3.6% over the period to 
30 September 2005. The accrued pension for H Sondergaard includes an inflationary increase of 3% over the period to 22 November 2005 
when she resigned.
2 Early retirement may be granted with the consent of the company and the Trustees of the Express Pension Scheme from age 50 but benefits are
reduced by 4% pa for ages 50 up to 59 years. Once in payment, pensions are increased in line with price inflation up to a ceiling of 3% pa in respect
of pensionable service accrued to 31 March 1997 and price inflation up to a ceiling of 5% pa on service accrued thereafter. The Trustees, with the
consent of the company, have discretion to apply such greater increase as they consider appropriate.
3 The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 less directors' contributions.
4 For T J Smith it is anticipated that his full entitlement as shown above will exceed the Inland Revenue maximum earnings cap for the Express Pension
Scheme. Funded and unfunded unapproved arrangements are in place to provide the balance of the total entitlements above the amount payable
from the Express Pension Scheme. In total  21,400 was paid into T J Smith's unapproved arrangements in the year.
5 N D Peet and S D Stevens are members of defined contribution pension schemes. Employers' contributions of  35,684 and  20,660 (2005:  14,532 and
 14,940) respectively were paid in the year. A further payment of  46,089 was made into N D Peet' s pension fund to reflect past pension liabilities.
