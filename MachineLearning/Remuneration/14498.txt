 Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee has responsibility for determining and agreeing with the board, within agreed terms of reference, the group's policy
for the remuneration of the executive directors and the individual remuneration packages for the executive directors including basic salary and
annual bonuses, the level and terms of grant of options and awards, and the terms of any performance conditions to apply to the exercise of such
rights, pension rights and any compensation payments. Where the remuneration committee considers it appropriate the committee will also make
recommendations in relation to the remuneration of senior management. The committee also liaises with the board in relation to the preparation
of the board's annual report to shareholders on the group's policy on the remuneration of executive directors and in particular the directors'
remuneration report, as required by the Companies Act 1985 (as amended), the Combined Code and the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority. 
It is chaired by Doug Dunn. Peter Cawdron, John Scarisbrick and Lawrence Tesler are also members of this committee which meets at least 
twice a year. Given their diverse experience, the four independent non-executive directors are able to offer a balanced view with respect to
remuneration issues for the group. The committee has access to professional advice from outside advisers, generally appointed by the Executive
Vice President Human Resources, in the furtherance of its duties and makes use of this. During 2002, Linklaters, Watson Wyatt, PricewaterhouseCoopers
and the Executive Vice President Human Resources have provided advice or services to the committee. PricewaterhouseCoopers also provided
services as the group's auditors. Linklaters provided other legal services to the group. Watson Wyatt did not provide any other services to the group
during this period. The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President Human Resources will normally attend these meetings. No
director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The remuneration committee in its deliberations on the remuneration policy for the group's directors seeks to give full consideration to the
Combined Code including the provisions set out in Schedule A to that code. The committee also monitors developments in the accounting for 
equity-based remuneration on an ongoing basis.
The group operates a remuneration policy for executive directors designed to ensure that it attracts and retains the management skills necessary
for it to remain a leader in its field. This policy seeks to provide rewards and incentives for the remuneration of executive directors that reflect their
performance and align with the objectives of the group and comprise a mix of performance-related and non-performance-related remuneration.
The committee believes that a director's total remuneration should seek to recognise his or her worth in the external market. 
The nature of the group's development has meant that there has been a good deal of focus on the attainment of short-term objectives with 
a high level of variable remuneration. Currently, variable remuneration consists of two fundamental elements: annual cash bonus and discretionary
share options. Both of these incentives are performance-related and as a result more than half of each executive director's remuneration is
targeted to be performance linked. Following a review of the group's variable remuneration structure, the remuneration committee concluded that,
in order to align better the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders, and to ensure that these key individuals are appropriately
incentivised to remain with the group, a higher proportion of executive directors' remuneration should focus on longer-term objectives. As a result,
a new policy has been adopted. The remuneration committee intends to introduce a shareholding guideline in accordance with that set out in the
Notice of Annual General Meeting.
At the heart of the new policy is a proposal to introduce a long-term incentive plan providing for the annual grant of performance shares  - 
a right to receive shares, subject to the group's performance. The group has consulted with its major shareholders and appropriate institutional
bodies such as the Association of British Insurers regarding the proposed long-term incentive plan, which is being put to shareholders for approval
at this year's Annual General Meeting.
It is also proposed to establish, subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting, an Inland Revenue approved share incentive plan, 
as a new element of the group's all employee  share incentive arrangements. Details of the proposed share incentive plan and the long-term
incentive plan are set out in the circular to shareholders accompanying this annual report.
Remuneration report/UK GAAP
ARM Annual report and accounts 2002  23 Incentive arrangements
The remuneration committee aims to ensure that individuals are fairly rewarded for their contribution to the success of the group. There is a 
strong bonus element to executives' remuneration of up to 50% of basic pay. The group operates an annual cash bonus scheme. Bonuses are
principally tied to the achievement of the group's financial results, with 50% bonus being awarded if all targets are met. There are three main
targets, namely sales, profit growth and forward orders generated for future periods, representing bonus opportunities of 15%, 20% and 15% of
base salary respectively. A range of possible outcomes for sales, profit and forward orders generated for future periods is agreed at the beginning
of each financial year. If the group's results exceed the minimum levels of each of the agreed targets, bonuses will be payable on a linear basis
between the minimum and the maximum of the agreed range. No bonuses are payable in respect of 2002 whilst bonuses of 32% were paid to
executive directors for 2001.
A deferred bonus scheme was introduced for executive directors in 2001. This enables executive directors to defer up to 100% of their annual
bonus for a period of up to three years during which time the amount of bonus deferred is increased by 33% per annum. It is intended to
discontinue this scheme. Existing deferrals will, however, be unaffected.
The group operates a number of share option plans and employees (excluding executive directors) can generally receive a number of share options
according to their grade, past performance and length of service in the group. Typically, share options are allocated to employees on an annual
basis. Discretionary options (under the Approved, Unapproved and Incentive Stock Option Schemes) are always issued at market value, while
options issued under the Save As You Earn and Employee Stock Purchase Plans are issued at a 15% discount to market value. In line with practice
among the group's peers in the technology sector, there are currently no performance conditions attached to the issue or exercise of discretionary
options except for those issued to executive directors. Share options issued to executive directors prior to their appointment to the board of the
group do not have performance conditions attached to them. However, discretionary options issued to executive directors after their appointment
to the board of the group will have performance conditions attached to them. The executive directors do not currently receive options under the
Approved Scheme and Incentive Stock Option Scheme. Under the Unapproved Scheme, share options with a value of up to five times base salary
may be issued on the executive director joining the group. In addition, discretionary options with a value of up to two times base salary may be
issued each year. These discretionary options will vest after seven years, but may vest after three years from grant if the performance condition is
satisfied. For options granted before January 2003 the performance condition is that the group must achieve an average real EPS growth of at least
33.1% (ie. 33.1% greater than the percentage increase (if any) in the Retail Price Index) over a performance period of three years commencing
from the start of the financial year in which the options are granted (the performance period ). The remuneration committee, as part of its review
of the group's variable remuneration structure, reviewed the performance condition for discretionary options to ensure that it remained an effective
tool for attracting, motivating and retaining executives, and was in keeping with the guidelines of the Association of British Insurers. As a result of
this review, it was decided to change the performance condition from a cliff-edge  to a sliding-scale  target for new option grants from January
2003. Under the performance condition, 50% of the shares under option will vest after three years if the group achieves an average real EPS
growth of 9.3% over the performance period. If an average real EPS growth of at least 33.1% is achieved over the performance period, 100% of
the shares under option will vest after three years. Where the average real EPS growth over the performance period is between 9.3% and 33.1%,
the number of shares which vest after three years increases on a straight-line basis. Although the performance targets are amongst the most
demanding of those set by companies included in the FTSE 350 index, the remuneration committee considers this to be appropriate as the 
group is operating in the technology market which is still expected to grow significantly in the long term.
Pensions
The group does not operate its own pension scheme but makes payments into a money purchase scheme  operated by third-party pension
providers. The rate of group contribution is 10% of the executive's basic salary (25% in the case of the Chairman) subject to the Inland Revenue
salary capping limits.
Remuneration report/UK GAAP/continued
24 ARM Annual report and accounts 2002 Service agreements
Executive directors have  rolling  service contracts that are terminable by either party on one year's notice. The service contracts also terminate
when executive directors reach age 65. These agreements provide for each of the directors to provide services to the group on a full-time basis.
The agreements contain restrictive covenants for periods of three to six months following termination of employment relating to non-competition,
non-solicitation of the group's customers, non-dealing with customers and non-solicitation of the group's suppliers and employees. In addition,
each service agreement contains an express obligation of confidentiality in respect of the group's trade secrets and confidential information and
provides for the group to own any intellectual property rights created by the directors in the course of their employment.
The dates of the service contracts of each person who served as a director during the financial year are as follows:
Director Date
Sir Robin Saxby 31 January 1996
Warren East 29 January 2001
Tim Score 1 March 2002
Tudor Brown 3 April 1996
Michael Muller 31 January 1996
Mike Inglis 17 July 2002
Jonathan Brooks 2 February 1996
Peter Magowan 29 January 2001
Where notice is served to terminate the appointment, whether by the group or the executive director, the group in its absolute discretion shall be
entitled to terminate the appointment by paying to the executive director his salary in lieu of any required period of notice.
Non-executive directors
During 2002, each non-executive director received a total fee of  24,000 per annum. This fee was arrived at by reference to fees paid by other
companies of similar size and complexity, and reflected the amount of time non-executive directors were expected to devote to the group's
activities during the year, which is around 10 to 15 working days a year. The group believes that Peter Cawdron, an independent non-executive
director, who currently holds more than five directorships, is able to devote the agreed amount of time to the group's activities. The remuneration
of the non-executive directors is set by the board of the group and their term of appointment is three years. Non-executive directors do not have
service contracts. Non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in bonus or share incentive arrangements and their service does not qualify
for pension purposes or other benefits. No element of their fees is performance-related.
Performance graphs
A performance graph showing the group's total shareholder return (TSR) together with the TSR for the FTSE Global Technology Index of 50
companies from 17 April 1998, the date when the group's shares first commenced trading on the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, is shown
below. The TSR is being calculated in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. The TSR for the group's shares was
67% over this period compared with -30% for the FTSE Global Technology Index for the same period.
TSR on  100 of ARM shares vs FTSE Global Technology Index (  sterling)
The directors consider the FTSE Global Technology Index to be an appropriate choice as the Index contains companies from the US, Asia and Europe,
which reflects the global environment in which the group operates. In addition, the Index includes many companies that are currently the group's
customers as well as companies which utilise ARM technology in their end products.

Share options with performance conditions attached normally vest after seven years. If, however, the group achieves an average EPS growth 
of at least 33.1% greater than the percentage increase (if any) in the Retail Price Index over a period of three years commencing from the start 
of the financial year in which the options are granted, then the options will be exercisable after three years from grant. EPS is defined as the
Group's fully diluted earnings per ordinary share. The method of calculating EPS will be adjusted if necessary so that the calculation of the 
EPS for each relevant financial period of the Group is broadly comparable with that for any other financial period of the Group taken for 
the purposes of the performance condition.
On 30 January 2003, discretionary share options were granted to the following executive directors: Warren East 914,285; Tim Score 777,142; 
Tudor Brown 731,428; Michael Muller 731,428; and Mike Inglis 731,428. The exercise price is 43.75 pence. 
These options vest after seven years, but may vest after three years if the following performance condition is satisfied. Where the Group achieves
an average EPS growth of at least 9.3% greater than the percentage increase (if any) in the Retail Prices Index over a performance period of three
years commencing from the start of the financial year in which options are granted, then 50% of the shares under option will vest three years
from grant. For an average EPS growth of at least 33.1% greater than the percentage increase (if any) in the Retail Prices Index over the
performance period, 100% of the shares under option will vest after three years from grant. Where the average EPS growth is between 9.3% and
33.1% greater than the percentage increase (if any) in the Retail Prices Index over the performance period, vesting increases on a straight-line basis.
