 Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee has responsibility for determining and agreeing with the board, within agreed terms of reference, the Group's policy
for the remuneration of the executive directors and the individual remuneration packages for the executive directors including basic salary and
annual bonuses, the level and terms of grants of options and awards and the terms of any performance conditions to apply to the exercise of such
rights, pension rights and any compensation payments. Where the remuneration committee considers it appropriate, the committee will make
recommendations in relation to the remuneration of senior management. The committee also liaises with the board in relation to the preparation
of the board's annual report to shareholders on the Group's policy on the remuneration of executive directors and in particular the directors'
remuneration report, as required by the Companies Act 1985 (as amended), the Combined Code and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority. 
The committee is chaired by Doug Dunn, and Peter Cawdron, John Scarisbrick and Lawrence Tesler are members. The committee met three 
times during 2003 and all meetings were attended by all the committee members, with the exception of the December 2003 meeting when
Lawrence Tesler was unable to attend. Given their diverse experience, the four independent non-executive directors are able to offer a balanced
view with respect to remuneration issues for the Group. The committee has access to professional advice from external advisers, generally appointed
by the Executive Vice President, Human Resources, in the furtherance of its duties and makes use of this. During 2003, Linklaters, Watson Wyatt,
Deloitte & Touche and the Executive Vice President, Human Resources, have provided advice or services to the committee. Linklaters provided other
legal services and Watson Wyatt provided pension advice to the Company during this period. The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Executive
Vice President, Human Resources, normally attend for part of the remuneration committee meetings. No director is involved in deciding his own
remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The remuneration committee in its deliberations on the remuneration policy for the Group's directors seeks to give full consideration to the
principles set out in the Combined Code. The committee also monitors developments in the accounting for equity-based remuneration on an
ongoing basis.
The Group operates a remuneration policy for executive directors designed to ensure that it attracts and retains the management skills necessary
for it to remain a leader in its field. This policy seeks to provide rewards and incentives for the remuneration of executive directors that reflect their
performance and align with the objectives of the Group, and comprise a mix of performance-related and non-performance-related remuneration.
The committee believes that a director's total remuneration should seek to recognise his worth in the external market. 
The nature of the Group's development has meant that there has been a good deal of focus on the attainment of short-term objectives with a high
level of variable remuneration. Currently, variable remuneration consists of three elements: annual cash bonus, discretionary share options and
conditional awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan. All these incentives are performance-related and, as a result, more than half of each
executive director's remuneration is targeted to be performance linked. Following a review of the Group's variable remuneration structure, the
remuneration committee concluded that, in order to align better the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders, and to ensure 
that these key individuals are appropriately incentivised to remain with the Group, a higher proportion of executive directors' remuneration should
focus on longer-term objectives. As a result, in 2003 a shareholding guideline was introduced under which executive directors and certain senior
managers are required to build up a holding of shares in the Company over a period of five years. The shareholdings will be built up of shares
received under the Company's discretionary share option schemes and/or the Long Term Incentive Plan and, in the case of executive directors, 
the required holding is 100% of basic salary.
Incentive arrangements
The remuneration committee aims to ensure that individuals are fairly rewarded for their contribution to the success of the Group. There is a strong
bonus element to executive directors' remuneration with a bonus of up to 50% of basic pay being available through the executive bonus plan 
if all targets are met. Payment of bonus is subject to the achievement of targets set by the remuneration committee which are directly related 
to the Group's financial results. No bonuses are payable to executive directors in respect of 2003.
For the 2004 operation of the bonus plan, three targets have been set by the remuneration committee, namely growth in profit before tax 
and growth in revenues (each of which account for 50% of total bonus potential) with the proviso that no bonus will be payable unless earnings
per share exceed a defined target. If the Group's targets are achieved, bonuses will be payable on a linear basis between the minimum and the
maximum of the agreed range. Annual bonuses can be doubled under the deferred bonus plan if payment is deferred for three years. Details of
the deferred bonus plan are set out on page 29.
The Group operates a number of share option plans and employees generally receive a number of share options according to their grade, past
performance and length of service. Typically, share options are allocated to employees on an annual basis. Discretionary options (under the
Approved, Unapproved and Incentive Stock Option Schemes) are always issued at market value, while options issued under the Save As You Earn
and Employee Stock Purchase Plans are issued at a 15% discount to market value. In line with practice among the Group's peers in the technology
sector, there are generally no performance conditions attached to the issue or exercise of discretionary options except for those issued to executive
Remuneration report/UK GAAP
24 ARM Annual report and accounts 2003 directors. Share options issued to executive directors prior to their appointment to the board of the Group do not have performance conditions
attached to them. However, discretionary options issued to executive directors after their appointment to the board of the Group will have
performance conditions attached to them. The executive directors do not currently receive options under the Approved Scheme and Incentive Stock
Option Scheme. Under the Unapproved Scheme, share options with a value of up to five times base salary may be issued on the executive director
joining the Group. In addition, discretionary options with a value of up to two times base salary may be issued each year. These discretionary
options will vest after seven years, but may vest after three years from grant if the performance conditions are satisfied. 
For options granted before January 2003, the performance condition is that the Group must achieve average real EPS growth of at least 33.1% 
(i.e. 33.1% greater than the percentage increase (if any) in the Retail Prices Index) over a performance period of three years from the start of the
financial year in which the options were granted (the performance period ). 
For options granted from January 2003 under the performance condition, 50% of the shares under option will vest after three years if the 
Group achieves average real EPS growth of 9.3% over the performance period. If average real EPS growth of at least 33.1% is achieved over 
the performance period, 100% of the shares under option will vest after three years. Where the average real EPS growth over the performance
period is between 9.3% and 33.1%, the number of shares which vest after three years increases on a straight-line basis. 
For options granted from January 2004 under the performance condition, 50% of the shares under option will vest after three years if the Group
achieves average real EPS growth of 12.5% over the performance period. If average real EPS growth of at least 33.1% is achieved over the
performance period, 100% of the shares under option will vest after three years. Where the average real EPS growth over the performance period
is between 12.5% and 33.1%, the number of shares which vest after three years increases on a straight-line basis.
Pensions
The Group does not operate its own pension scheme but makes payments into a Group personal pension plan, which is a money purchase
scheme. The rate of Group contribution is 10% of the executive's basic salary (25% in the case of the Chairman) subject to the Inland Revenue
salary capping limits.
Service agreements
Executive directors have rolling  service contracts that may be terminated by either party on one year's notice. The service contracts also terminate
when executive directors reach age 65. With the exception of the Chairman, these agreements provide for each of the directors to provide services
to the Group on a full-time basis. The agreements contain restrictive covenants for periods of three to six months following termination of
employment relating to non-competition, non-solicitation of the Group's customers, non-dealing with customers and non-solicitation of the Group's
suppliers and employees. In addition, each service agreement contains an express obligation of confidentiality in respect of the Group's trade
secrets and confidential information and provides for the Group to own any intellectual property rights created by the directors in the course of
their employment.
The dates of the service contracts of each person who served as an executive director during the financial year are as follows:
Director Date
Sir Robin Saxby 31 January 1996
Warren East 29 January 2001
Tim Score 1 March 2002
Tudor Brown 3 April 1996
Mike Muller 31 January 1996
Mike Inglis 17 July 2002
Where notice is served to terminate the appointment, whether by the Group or the executive director, the Group in its absolute discretion shall be
entitled to terminate the appointment by paying to the executive director his salary in lieu of any required period of notice.
Non-executive directors
During 2003, each non-executive director received a total fee of  24,000 per annum. This fee was arrived at by reference to fees paid by other
companies of similar size and complexity, and reflected the amount of time non-executive directors were expected to devote to the Group's
activities during the year, which is around 10 to 15 working days a year. Peter Cawdron, an independent non-executive director who currently
holds more than five directorships, has devoted during his term of office, and continues to be able to devote, the agreed amount of time to the
Group's activities. The remuneration of the non-executive directors is set by the board and their term of appointment is three years. Non-executive
directors do not have service contracts, are not eligible to participate in bonus or share incentive arrangements and their service does not qualify
for pension purposes or other benefits. No element of their fees is performance-related.

A performance graph showing the Company's total shareholder return (TSR) together with the TSR for the FTSE Global Technology Index of 
50 companies from 31 December 1998 is shown below. The TSR has been calculated in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002. The TSR for the Company's shares was 101% over this period compared with -29% for the FTSE Global Technology Index for 
the same period.
TSR on  100 of ARM shares vs FTSE Global Technology Index (  sterling)
The directors consider the FTSE Global Technology Index to be an appropriate choice as the Index contains companies from the US, Asia and Europe,
which reflects the global environment in which the Group operates. In addition, the Index includes many companies that are currently the Group's
customers, as well as companies which use ARM technology in their end products.

On 22 April 2003 Sir Robin Saxby exercised an option over 600,000 shares and made a donation of such shares to the University of Liverpool. 
The gain calculated at the exercise date was  330,000 (2002:  nil). The share price on the date of exercise was  0.57.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2003 27 Share options with performance conditions attached normally vest after seven years. If, however, the Group achieves an average EPS growth of 
at least 33.1% greater than the percentage increase (if any) in the Retail Price Index (RPI) over a period of three years from the start of the
financial year in which the options are granted, then the options will be exercisable after three years from grant. EPS is defined as the Group's fully
diluted earnings per ordinary share. The method of calculating EPS will be adjusted if necessary so that the calculation of the EPS for each relevant
financial period of the Group is broadly comparable with that for any other financial period of the Group taken for the purposes of the performance
condition.
On 30 January 2004, discretionary share options were granted to the following executive directors: Warren East 400,000; Tim Score 320,000; Tudor

These options vest after seven years, but may vest after three years if the following performance condition is satisfied. Where the Group achieves
an average EPS growth of at least 12.5% greater than the percentage increase (if any) in the RPI over a performance period of three years from the
start of the financial year in which options are granted, then 50% of the shares under option will vest three years from grant. For an average EPS
growth of at least 33.1% greater than the percentage increase (if any) in the RPI over the performance period, 100% of the shares under option
will vest after three years from grant. Where the average EPS growth is between 12.5% and 33.1% greater than the percentage increase (if any)
in the RPI over the performance period, vesting increases on a straight-line basis.

Conditional awards will vest to the extent that the performance criteria are satisfied over a three-year performance period from 1 January 2003 
to 31 December 2005. The performance conditions are based on the Company's TSR when measured against that of two comparator groups (each
testing half of the shares comprised in the award). The first index comprises UK companies across all sectors (FTSE 250) and the second comprises
predominantly US companies within the Hi Tech sector (FTSE Global Technology Index). For each comparator group, the number of shares that may
vest may be up to a maximum of 200% of the shares if the Company's TSR ranks in the upper decile, 50% will vest in the event of median
performance and between median and upper decile performance vesting will increase on a straight-line basis. No shares will be received for
below-median performance. In addition, no shares will vest unless the committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the
underlying financial performance of the Company.

Deferred bonus plan
The deferred bonus plan was introduced in 2001 and enables directors to double their annual bonus if payment is deferred for three years, and 
to receive 6% interest per annum on the deferred element. Warren East elected to participate in the plan in 2001 and deferred  12,680, being
one-third of his bonus, for three years. Provided Warren East remains with the Group until 31 December 2004, the bonus payable on that date 
will be  25,360 representing an increase of 100% plus interest. There are no other outstanding arrangements under this plan.
