 Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee has responsibility for determining and agreeing with the board, within agreed terms of reference, the Group's policy
for the remuneration of the executive directors and the individual remuneration packages for the executive directors including basic salary and
annual bonuses, the level and terms of grants of options and awards and the terms of any performance conditions to apply to the exercise of such
options and awards, pension rights and any compensation payments. Where the remuneration committee considers it appropriate, the committee
will make recommendations in relation to the remuneration of senior management. The committee also liaises with the board in relation to the
preparation of the board's annual report to shareholders on the Group's policy on the remuneration of executive directors and in particular the
directors' remuneration report, as required by the Companies Act 1985 (as amended), the Combined Code and the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority. 
The committee is chaired by Doug Dunn, and Peter Cawdron, John Scarisbrick and Jeremy Scudamore are members. The committee met three
times during 2004 and all meetings were attended by all the committee members, with the exception of the July and December meetings when
Jeremy Scudamore was unable to attend. Given their diverse experience, the four independent non-executive directors are able to offer a balanced
view with respect to remuneration issues for the Group. The committee has access to professional advice from external advisers, generally
appointed by Bill Parsons, the Executive Vice President, Human Resources, in the furtherance of its duties and makes use of such advice. During
2004, Linklaters, Watson Wyatt, Deloitte & Touche and the Executive Vice President, Human Resources, have provided advice or services to the
committee. Linklaters provided legal services and Watson Wyatt provided pension advice to the Group during this period. The Chairman, the Chief
Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President, Human Resources, normally attend for part of the remuneration committee meetings. No
director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The remuneration committee in its deliberations on the remuneration policy for the Group's directors seeks to give full consideration to the principles
set out in the Combined Code. The committee also monitors developments in accounting for equity-based remuneration on an ongoing basis.
The Group operates a remuneration policy for executive directors designed to ensure that it attracts and retains the management skills necessary
for it to remain a leader in its field. This policy seeks to provide rewards and incentives for the remuneration of executive directors that reflect their
performance and align with the objectives of the Group, and comprise a mix of performance-related and non-performance-related remuneration.
The committee believes that a director's total remuneration should seek to recognise his worth in the external market and, to this end, operates 
a policy of paying base salaries which are in line with the market median, as part of a total remuneration package which is upper quartile. The
committee believes that this is justified, recognising that more than 50% of total remuneration is performance-related. The committee obtains
information about the external market from various surveys, including the Watson Wyatt High Technology and Executive Reward Surveys and the
Deloitte & Touche Executive Directors Remuneration Survey.
The nature of the Group's development has meant that there has been a good deal of focus on the attainment of short-term objectives with a high
level of variable remuneration. Currently, variable remuneration consists of three elements: annual cash bonus, discretionary share options and
conditional awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan. All these incentives are performance-related and, as a result, more than half of each
executive director's remuneration is targeted to be performance linked. Following a review of the Group's variable remuneration structure, the
remuneration committee concluded that, in order to align better the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders, and to ensure 
that these key individuals are appropriately incentivised to remain with the Group, a higher proportion of executive directors' remuneration should
focus on longer-term objectives. As a result, in 2003 a shareholding guideline was introduced under which executive directors and certain senior
managers are required to build up a holding of shares in the Company over a period of five years. The shareholdings may be built up of shares
received under the Company's discretionary share option schemes and/or the Long Term Incentive Plan and, in the case of executive directors, 
the required holding is equivalent in value to 100% of basic salary.
Incentive arrangements
The remuneration committee aims to ensure that individuals are fairly rewarded for their contribution to the success of the Group. There is a strong
bonus element to executive directors' remuneration with a bonus of up to 50% of basic pay being available through the executive bonus plan 
if all targets are met. Payment of bonus is subject to the achievement of revenue and profit targets set by the remuneration committee, which 
are directly related to the Group's financial results and ensure that the Group's short-term financial goals are met. Full bonuses are payable to
executive directors in respect of performance during 2004.
For the 2005 operation of the bonus plan, the targets set by the remuneration committee are for growth in dollar revenues between an agreed
range with the proviso that no bonus will be payable unless earnings per share exceed a defined target. If these targets are achieved, bonuses 
will be payable on a linear basis between the minimum and the maximum of the agreed range. Any over achievement of the stretching revenue
target will result in the percentage out-performance being applied to the bonus, for example if the revenue target is exceeded by 10% the bonus
will increase by 5%. Annual bonuses can be doubled under the deferred bonus plan if payment is deferred for three years, although there are no
outstanding elections to do so. Details of the deferred bonus plan are set out on page 33.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 27
Remuneration report/UK GAAP 28 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004
The Group operates a number of share option plans and employees generally receive a number of share options according to their grade and
performance. Typically, share options are allocated to employees on an annual basis. Discretionary options (under the Approved, Unapproved and
Incentive Stock Option Schemes) are always issued at market value, while options issued under the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme and the
Savings-Related Share Option Plan are issued at a 15% discount to market value. In line with practice among the Group's peers in the technology
sector, there are generally no performance conditions attached to the issue or exercise of discretionary options except for those issued to executive
directors where performance conditions based on real EPS apply to drive long-term profitability. Share options issued to executive directors prior 
to their appointment to the board of the Group do not have performance conditions attached to them. However, discretionary options issued to
executive directors after their appointment to the board of the Group will have performance conditions attached to them. Executive directors do
not currently receive options under the Approved Scheme and Incentive Stock Option Scheme. Under the Unapproved Scheme, share options with 
a value of up to five times base salary may be issued on the executive director joining the Group. In addition, discretionary options with a value 
of up to two times base salary may be issued each year. These discretionary options will vest after seven years, but may vest after three years
from grant if the performance conditions are satisfied. 
For options granted before January 2003, the performance condition is that the Group must achieve average real EPS growth of at least 33.1% 
(i.e. 33.1% greater than the percentage increase (if any) in the Retail Prices Index) over a performance period of three years from the start of the
financial year in which the options were granted (the performance period ). 
For options granted in 2003 under the performance condition, 50% of the shares under option will vest after three years if the Group achieves
average real EPS growth of 9.3% over the performance period. If average real EPS growth of at least 33.1% is achieved over the performance
period, 100% of the shares under option will vest after three years. Where the average real EPS growth over the performance period is between
9.3% and 33.1%, the number of shares which vest after three years increases on a straight-line basis. 
For options granted in 2004 and 2005 under the performance condition, 50% of the shares under option will vest after three years if the Group
achieves average real EPS growth of 12.5% over the performance period. If average real EPS growth of at least 33.1% is achieved over the
performance period, 100% of the shares under option will vest after three years. Where the average real EPS growth over the performance period
is between 12.5% and 33.1%, the number of shares which vest after three years increases on a straight-line basis.
The performance conditions applicable to the Long Term Incentive Plan are described in more detail below and are based on total shareholder
return (TSR), rather than EPS, providing the link to performance against an appropriate peer group.
These performance conditions were selected having regard to the position of the Group within its sector and the nature of the companies against
which it competes to attract and retain high-calibre employees. The Committee believes that the performance conditions represent the correct
balance between being motivational and challenging.
Pensions
The Group does not operate its own pension scheme but makes payments into a Group personal pension plan, which is a money purchase scheme.
For the UK-based directors, the rate of Group contribution is 10% of the executive's basic salary (25% in the case of the Chairman) subject to the
Inland Revenue salary capping limits. For Mark Templeton (who is based in the US) the rate of Group contribution is 6% of his basic salary.
Service agreements
Executive directors have rolling  service contracts that may be terminated by either party on one year's notice. The service contracts also
terminate when executive directors reach age 65. With the exception of the Chairman, these agreements provide for each of the directors to
provide services to the Group on a full-time basis. The agreements contain restrictive covenants for periods of three to six months following
termination of employment relating to non-competition, non-solicitation of the Group's customers, non-dealing with customers and non-solicitation
of the Group's suppliers and employees. In addition, each service agreement contains an express obligation of confidentiality in respect of the
Group's trade secrets and confidential information and provides for the Group to own any intellectual property rights created by the directors in 
the course of their employment.

The dates of the service contracts of each person who served as an executive director during the financial year are as follows:
Director Date
Sir Robin Saxby 31 January 1996
Warren East 29 January 2001
Tim Score 1 March 2002
Tudor Brown 3 April 1996
Mike Muller 31 January 1996
Mike Inglis 17 July 2002
Mark Templeton 18 November 2004
Where notice is served to terminate the appointment, whether by the Group or the executive director, the Group in its absolute discretion shall be
entitled to terminate the appointment by paying to the executive director his salary in lieu of any required period of notice.
Non-executive directors
During 2004, the Chairmen of the audit and remuneration committees each received a total fee of  29,000 per annum and the other non-
executive directors each received a total fee of  27,000 per annum. These fees were arrived at by reference to fees paid by other companies 
of similar size and complexity, and reflected the amount of time non-executive directors were expected to devote to the Group's activities during
the year, which is around 10 to 15 working days a year. The remuneration of the non-executive directors is set by the board and their term of
appointment is three years. Non-executive directors do not have service contracts, are not eligible to participate in bonus or share incentive
arrangements and their service does not qualify for pension purposes or other benefits. No element of their fees is performance-related. The
options held by Lucio Lanza were granted during his service with Artisan and were rolled over into options over ARM shares under the terms 
of the acquisition.
Performance graphs
A performance graph showing the Company's total shareholder return (TSR) together with the TSR for the FTSE Global Technology Index of 
50 companies from 31 December 1999 is shown below. The TSR has been calculated in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002. The TSR for the Company's shares was -87% over this period compared with -67% for the FTSE Global Technology Index 
for the same period.
ARM share price performance against the FTSE Global Technology Index (  sterling)
The directors consider the FTSE Global Technology Index to be an appropriate choice as the Index contains companies from the US, Asia and Europe
and, therefore, reflects the global environment in which the Group operates. In addition, the Index includes many companies that are currently the
Group's customers, as well as companies which use ARM technology in their end products.

Conditional awards will vest to the extent that the performance criteria are satisfied over a three-year performance period from 1 January of the
year of award, and no re-testing thereafter is possible. The performance conditions are based on the Company's TSR when measured against that
of two comparator groups (each testing half of the shares comprised in the award). The first index comprises UK companies across all sectors (FTSE
250) and the second comprises predominantly US companies within the Hi Tech sector (FTSE Global Technology Index). For each comparator group,
the number of shares that may vest may be up to a maximum of 200% of the shares if the Company's TSR ranks in the upper decile, 50% will
vest in the event of median performance and between median and upper decile performance vesting will increase on a straight-line basis. No
shares will be received for below-median performance. In addition, no shares will vest unless the committee is satisfied that there has been a
sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company. 
Except as described above, there have been no changes in directors' interests under the Group's share option schemes since the end of the 2004
financial year up to the date of approval of the remuneration report.
