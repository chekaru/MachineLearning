 Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee has responsibility for determining and agreeing with the board, within agreed terms of reference, the Group's policy
for the remuneration of the executive directors and the individual remuneration packages for the executive directors including basic salary and
annual bonuses, the level and terms of grants of options and awards and the terms of any performance conditions to apply to the exercise of such
rights, pension rights and any compensation payments. Where the remuneration committee considers it appropriate, the committee will make
recommendations in relation to the remuneration of senior management. The committee also liaises with the board in relation to the preparation
of the board's annual report to shareholders on the Group's policy on the remuneration of executive directors and in particular the directors'
remuneration report, as required by the Companies Act 1985 (as amended), the Combined Code and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority. 
The committee is chaired by Doug Dunn, and Peter Cawdron, John Scarisbrick and Jeremy Scudamore are members. The committee met five times
during 2005 and all meetings were attended by all the committee members, with the exception of the January meeting when John Scarisbrick was
unable to attend. Given their diverse experience, the four independent non-executive directors are able to offer a balanced view with respect to
remuneration issues for the Group. The committee has access to professional advice from external advisers, generally appointed by the Executive
Vice President, Human Resources, in the furtherance of its duties and makes use of such advice. During 2005, KPMG, Linklaters, Watson Wyatt,
Deloitte & Touche and the Executive Vice President, Human Resources, have provided advice or services to the committee. KPMG provided advice
on the new executive compensation framework, Linklaters provided legal services and Watson Wyatt provided pension advice to the Group during
this period. The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President, Human Resources, normally attend for part of the remuneration
committee meetings. No director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
During 2005 the committee undertook an extensive review of the pay and incentive structures for senior executives and has proposed some key
changes for executive directors which are outlined below and are described in more detail in a circular which was sent to shareholders in March
2006 and is available on the corporate website at www.arm.com. The key changes proposed are:
l New Deferred Annual Bonus Plan: the maximum bonus opportunity is to be increased from 100% under the current deferred bonus plan 
to 125% of base salary with compulsory deferral into shares of 50% of the bonus earned and an opportunity to earn an equity match of up 
to 2:1 measured against an EPS performance condition;
l Long Term Incentive Plan: it is proposed that the comparator group for the TSR performance measure be changed from the FTSE 250 to the 
FTSE 350 to better reflect the Company's position within the index; and
l Employee Equity Plan: it is proposed to cease granting options to all employees including executive directors (other than in exceptional
circumstances) and introduce an all-employee share plan.
Details of the new proposals were sent to larger shareholders and other interested parties in October 2005 and a period of consultation has
followed. The committee believes that these proposals reflect good governance, bring the remuneration structure closer in line with UK market
norms, increase alignment between remuneration and financial performance and strengthen the retention aspect of the deferred bonus. The 
move away from options to shares for all employees will reduce dilution and the move from three plans to two for executive directors 
simplifies arrangements.
Remuneration policy
The remuneration committee in its deliberations on the remuneration policy for the Group's directors seeks to give full consideration to the
principles set out in the Combined Code. The committee also monitors developments in accounting for equity-based remuneration on an 
ongoing basis.
The Group operates a remuneration policy and framework for executive directors designed to ensure that it attracts and retains the high-quality
management skills necessary to achieve a high level of corporate performance, in line with the best interests of shareholders. This policy seeks 
to provide rewards and incentives for the remuneration of executive directors that reflect their performance and align with the objectives of the
Group. These comprise a mix of performance-related and non-performance-related remuneration. The committee believes that a director's total
remuneration should seek to recognise his worth in the external market and, to this end, operates a policy of paying base salaries which are in line
with the market median, as part of a total remuneration package which is upper quartile. The committee believes that this is justified, recognising
that more than 50% of total potential remuneration is performance-related. The committee obtains information about the external market 
from various surveys, including the Watson Wyatt High Technology and Executive Reward Surveys and the Deloitte & Touche Executive Directors
Remuneration Survey.
The nature of the Group's development has meant that there has been a good deal of focus on the attainment of short-term objectives with a 
high level of variable remuneration. In 2005, variable remuneration consisted of three elements: annual cash bonus, discretionary share options and
conditional awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan. As described above, subject to approval at the 2006 AGM, this will reduce to two elements
in future, both of which are performance-related and, as a result, more than half of each executive director's remuneration is targeted to be
performance linked. In 2003 a shareholding guideline was introduced under which executive directors and certain senior managers are required to
ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 25
Remuneration report/UK reporting build up a holding of shares in the Company over a period of five years. The shareholdings may be built up of shares received under the Company's
discretionary share option schemes and/or the Long Term Incentive Plan and/or the new Deferred Annual Bonus Plan and, in the case of executive
directors, the required holding is 100% of basic salary.
Incentive arrangements
The remuneration committee aims to ensure that individuals are fairly rewarded for their contribution to the success of the Group. There is a strong
bonus element to executive directors' remuneration and for 2005 a bonus of up to 50% of basic pay could have been earned through the executive
bonus plan if all targets were met (plus an accelerator for performance in excess of targets and the ability to increase the bonus to 100% by
deferring the entire bonus for three years). Payment of bonus is subject to the achievement of revenue and profit targets set by the remuneration
committee, which are directly related to the Group's financial results and ensure that the Group's short-term financial goals are met. Small bonuses
are payable to executive directors in respect of performance during 2005, as shown in the table on page 33.
Proposed new Deferred Annual Bonus Plan
Subject to approval at the 2006 AGM, the new Deferred Annual Bonus Plan will operate for 2006 under which 50% of any bonus earned will be
paid in cash and 50% will be deferred into shares on a compulsory basis. Voluntary deferral will no longer be possible. Due to these changes and
the fact that no further grants of options will be made (except in exceptional circumstances) the maximum bonus opportunity will increase to 125%
of base salary (including a personal performance multiplier which flexes the payment by 0.75 to 1.25), which is in line with current market bonus
levels. The bonus earned will continue to be subject to a revenue target with an EPS underpin but the calibration will be changed. Under the 2005
bonus arrangement no bonus was payable at less than 90% of the revenue target and maximum bonus would have been paid at 100% of the
revenue target with a 1% increase in bonus for every 2% above the revenue target. Under the new Deferred Annual Bonus Plan no bonus is paid
at less than 90% of the revenue target and maximum bonus will now be paid at revenues above the target. In 2006 maximum bonus will be paid
at 104% of target revenues. The upper limit of the performance range will not exceed 110% of the target revenue. At the end of the three-year
deferral period the deferred shares will be matched subject to achievement of an EPS performance condition. At EPS growth equal to the increase
in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI ) plus 4% per annum, the deferred shares will be matched on a 0.3:1 basis, rising to 2:1 when EPS growth 
is in excess of CPI plus 12% per annum. While the deferral can only be forfeited for gross misconduct, the match is subject to forfeiture for 
bad leavers .
Proposed new Employee Equity Plan
Subject to approval at the 2006 AGM, the new Employee Equity Plan will operate for 2006, in place of the existing Employee Share Option
Schemes. The introduction of this plan reflects the shift in market practice away from options and towards free shares. However, to enable the
Group to respond to any future changes in market conditions, it is proposed that this plan provides the flexibility to grant either shares or options,
with a currency conversion  between the two to ensure that awards are of a similar value to employees and a similar cost to the Company. Under
this plan it is intended that free shares or options will be granted to employees on an annual basis up to a limit set for each grade and equivalent
to grant values under the existing Executive Share Option Scheme. In the three major employing countries and other countries as may be
appropriate, the new Employee Equity Plan may involve the use of government approved plans to deliver awards in a tax efficient manner. 
Existing option schemes
It is intended that the grant of options under the existing share option schemes will cease once the new Deferred Annual Bonus Plan and the new
Employee Equity Plan are approved by shareholders. In relation to existing grants of options, in line with practice among the Group's peers in the
technology sector, there are generally no performance conditions attached to the issue or exercise of discretionary options under the existing
schemes, except for those issued to executive directors where performance conditions based on real EPS growth apply. Share options issued to
executive directors prior to their appointment to the board of the Group do not have performance conditions attached to them. However,
discretionary options issued to executive directors after their appointment to the board of the Group have performance conditions attached to them.
Executive directors have not received options under the Approved Scheme and the Incentive Stock Option Scheme. Under the Unapproved Scheme,
share options with a value of up to five times base salary may be issued on the executive director joining the Group. In addition, discretionary
options with a value of up to two times base salary may be issued each year. These discretionary options will vest after seven years, but may vest
after three years from grant if the performance conditions are satisfied. 
Performance conditions applicable to these options vary depending on the year of grant and details of these conditions are shown in the auditable
information below.
The performance conditions applicable to the Long Term Incentive Plan are described in more detail below and are based on total shareholder
return (TSR ), providing the link to performance against an appropriate peer group.
26 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Remuneration report/UK reporting/continued These performance conditions were selected having regard to the position of the Group within its sector and the nature of the companies against
which it competes to attract and retain high calibre employees. The Committee believes that the performance conditions represent the correct
balance between being motivational and challenging.
Pensions
The Group does not operate its own pension scheme but makes payments into a Group personal pension plan, which is a money purchase scheme.
For the UK based directors, the rate of Group contribution is 10% of the executive's basic salary (25% in the case of the Chairman) subject to the
Inland Revenue salary capping limits. From April 2006 when the salary capping limits cease to apply, contributions will be calculated on full basic
pay. For Mark Templeton (who is based in the US), the rate of Group contribution was 6% of his basic salary up to October 2005 when his status
changed from executive to non-executive director.
Service agreements
Executive directors have rolling  service contracts that may be terminated by either party on one year's notice. The service contracts also terminate
when executive directors reach age 65. With the exception of the Chairman, these agreements provide for each of the directors to provide services
to the Group on a full-time basis. The agreements contain restrictive covenants for periods of three to six months following termination of
employment relating to non-competition, non-solicitation of the Group's customers, non-dealing with customers and non-solicitation of the 
Group's suppliers and employees. In addition, each service agreement contains an express obligation of confidentiality in respect of the Group's
trade secrets and confidential information and provides for the Group to own any intellectual property rights created by the directors in the 
course of their employment.
The dates of the service contracts of each person who served as an executive director during the financial year are as follows:
Director Date
Sir Robin Saxby 31 January 1996
Warren East 29 January 2001
Tim Score 1 March 2002
Tudor Brown 3 April 1996
Mike Inglis 17 July 2002
Mike Muller 31 January 1996
Simon Segars 4 January 2005
Mark Templeton 18 November 2004
Where notice is served to terminate the appointment, whether by the Group or the executive director, the Group in its absolute discretion shall be
entitled to terminate the appointment by paying to the executive director his salary in lieu of any required period of notice.
Non-executive directors
During 2005, the Chairmen of the audit and remuneration committees each received a total fee of  33,000 per annum and the other non-executive
directors each received a total fee of  30,000 per annum. These fees were arrived at by reference to fees paid by other companies of similar size
and complexity, and reflected the amount of time non-executive directors were expected to devote to the Group's activities during the year, which
is between 10 to 15 working days a year. The remuneration of the non-executive directors is set by the board and their term of appointment is
three years. Non-executive directors do not have service contracts, are not eligible to participate in bonus or share incentive arrangements and their
service does not qualify for pension purposes or other benefits. No element of their fees is performance-related. Share options held by Lucio Lanza
were granted prior to the Group's acquisition of Artisan and share options held by Mark Templeton were granted prior to his change of status from
executive to non-executive director in October 2005.

A performance graph showing the Company's TSR together with the TSR for the FTSE All-World Technology Index of 249 companies from 
31 December 2000 is shown below. The TSR has been calculated in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. 
The TSR for the Company's shares was -76% over this period compared with -42% for the FTSE All-World Technology Index for the same period.
ARM total return performance from 31 December 2000 to 31 December 2005 (  sterling)
The directors consider the FTSE All-World Technology Index to be an appropriate choice as the Index contains companies from the US, Asia and
Europe and therefore reflects the global environment in which the Group operates. In addition, the Index includes many companies that are
currently the Group's customers, as well as companies which use ARM technology in their end products.

In addition to the interests disclosed above, all the executive directors (together with all the employees of the Group) are potential beneficiaries 
of the ARM Holdings plc Employee Share Ownership Plan. They are, therefore, treated as interested in all the shares held by this trust, being
5,000,000 ordinary shares at 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2004. The shares that vested under the Long Term Incentive Plan on 1 February
2006 were transferred from the Trust reducing the number that the executive directors are treated as being interested in to 1,201,438 ordinary
shares. The executive directors also have interests in dividend shares that could be awarded under the Long Term Incentive Plan, the amount of
which will depend on the extent to which the performance criteria are satisfied and the dividends declared during the performance period.

* The performance period for the 2003 LTIP grant ended on 31 December 2005 and as such the actual number of awards vesting is disclosed below.
** Mark Templeton was conditionally awarded 162,794 shares as part of the 2005 LTIP grant, but these lapsed on his change in status from an executive to a non-executive director in October 2005, thus none
were held at 31 December 2005.
Conditional awards will vest to the extent that the performance criteria are satisfied over a three-year performance period from 1 January of the year
of award. The performance conditions are based on the Company's TSR when measured against that of two comparator groups (each testing half of the
shares comprised in the award). The first index comprises UK companies across all sectors (FTSE 250) and the second comprises predominantly US
companies within the Hi Tech sector (FTSE Global Technology Index). For each comparator group, the number of shares that may vest may be 
up to a maximum of 200% of the shares if the Company's TSR ranks in the upper decile, 50% will vest in the event of median performance and
between median and upper decile performance vesting will increase on a straight-line basis. Additional shares may vest to cover dividends paid 
by the Company during the performance period. No shares will be received for below-median performance. In addition, no shares will vest unless
the committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company. For 2006 awards
it is intended that the first comparator group be changed from the FTSE 250 to the FTSE 350 to reflect the Company's position within the index.
The performance conditions applicable to the conditional awards granted on 25 July 2003 were satisfied to the extent of 175.9% plus dividend
shares which vested on 1 February 2006, as follows:

and to receive 6% interest per annum on the deferred element. There are no outstanding arrangements under this plan and, subject to approval of
the new Annual Deferred Bonus Plan at the 2006 AGM, there will be no further operation of this plan. ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 33
