 28 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee has responsibility for determining and agreeing with the board, within agreed terms of reference, the Group's policy
for the remuneration of the executive directors and the individual remuneration packages for each executive director. This includes basic salary,
annual bonus, the level and terms of conditional awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan and the terms of performance conditions that apply to
such benefits, pension rights and any compensation payments. Where the remuneration committee considers it appropriate, the committee will
make recommendations in relation to the remuneration of senior management. The committee also liaises with the board in relation to the
preparation of the board's annual report to shareholders on the Group's policy on the remuneration of executive directors and in particular the
directors' remuneration report, as required by the Companies Act 2005, the Combined Code and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Chairmanship of the committee passed to Jeremy Scudamore on 1 October 2006, on the appointment of Doug Dunn as Group Chairman and the
other members are Peter Cawdron, and Kathleen O'Donovan (who was appointed with effect from 1 January 2007 in place of John Scarisbrick).
The committee met four times during 2006. Given their diverse experience, the three independent non-executive directors are able to offer a
balanced view with respect to remuneration issues for the Group. The committee has access to professional advice from external advisers (generally
appointed by the Executive Vice President, Human Resources) in the furtherance of its duties and makes use of such advice. During 2006, KPMG
provided advice on the new Deferred Annual Bonus Plan and Employee Equity Plan, Linklaters provided legal services, Deloitte and the Executive
Vice President, Human Resources, have provided other advice or services to the committee and to the Group. The Chief Executive Officer and the
Executive Vice President, Human Resources, normally attend for part of remuneration committee meetings. No director is involved in deciding his
own remuneration.
Following an extensive review of executive remuneration by the remuneration committee, a new Deferred Annual Bonus Plan for executive
directors and senior managers and an Employee Equity Plan for all other employees were approved by shareholders at the 2006 AGM. These
plans brought the remuneration structure more closely in line with UK market norms, increased alignment between remuneration and financial
performance and strengthened the retention aspect of the deferred bonus. Cessation of option grants to executive directors (other than in
exceptional circumstances) and the reduction from three plans to two for executive directors and senior managers, together with the move
away from options to shares for all employees reduces potential dilution and simplifies remuneration arrangements.
Remuneration policy
The remuneration committee, in its deliberations on the remuneration policy for the Group's directors, seeks to give full consideration to the
principles set out in the Combined Code. The committee also monitors developments in the accounting for equity-based remuneration on an
ongoing basis.
The Group operates a remuneration policy and framework for executive directors designed to ensure that it attracts and retains the high-quality
management skills necessary to achieve a high level of corporate performance, in line with the best interests of shareholders. This policy seeks to
provide rewards and incentives for the remuneration of executive directors that reflect their performance and align with the objectives of the Group.
These comprise a mix of performance-related and non-performance-related remuneration. The committee believes that a director's total remuneration
should seek to recognise his worth in the external market and, to this end, operates a policy of paying base salaries which are in line with the
market median, as part of a total remuneration package which is upper quartile. The committee believes that this is justified, recognising that more
than 50% of total potential remuneration is performance-related. The committee obtains information about the external market from various surveys,
including the Watson Wyatt High Technology and Executive Reward Surveys and the Deloitte Executive Directors' Remuneration Survey.
The nature of the Group's development has meant that there has been a good deal of focus on the attainment of short-term objectives with a high
level of variable remuneration. In 2006, variable remuneration consisted of three elements: annual cash bonus, a conditional award under the Long
Term Incentive Plan and a final award of discretionary share options to provide potential benefits in 2009, when there would otherwise be a gap
because deferred shares under the deferred bonus plan will not vest until 2010. As described above this will reduce to two elements in 2007, both
of which are performance-related and, as a result, more than half of each executive director's remuneration is targeted to be performance linked.
A shareholding guideline is in place for executive directors and certain senior managers who are required to build up a holding of shares in the
Company over a period of five years. The shareholdings may be built up of shares received under the Company's share option schemes and/or the
Long Term Incentive Plan and/or the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan and, in the case of executive directors, the required holding is 100% of basic salary.
Incentive arrangements
The remuneration committee aims to ensure that individuals are fairly rewarded for their contribution to the success of the Group. The various
incentive schemes that comprise the remuneration packages of executive directors and senior managers are described below:
Remuneration report/UK reporting ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 29
Deferred Annual Bonus Plan
There is a strong bonus element to executive directors' remuneration and for 2006 a bonus of up to 125% of base salary (including a personal
performance multiplier which flexes the payment by 0.75 to 1.25), could have been earned through the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan if all targets
were met. There is compulsory deferral into shares of 50% of the bonus earned and an opportunity to earn an equity match of up to 2:1, subject
to achievement of an EPS performance condition. Deferred shares and any matching shares earned will normally be transferred three years from
the date of award. Payment of bonus is subject to the achievement of US$ revenue and EPS targets set by the remuneration committee, which are
directly related to the Group's financial results and encourage the achievement of the Group's short-term financial goals. The bonuses payable to
executive directors in respect of performance during 2006 are shown in the table on page 36 and are in the range 70% to 73% of base salary,
50% of which was compulsorily deferred into shares. At EPS growth equal to the increase in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI ) plus 4% per annum,
the deferred shares will be matched on a 0.3:1 basis, rising to 2:1 when EPS growth is in excess of CPI plus 12% per annum. While the deferral
can only be forfeited for gross misconduct, the matching shares are subject to forfeiture for bad leavers . For 2007, 50% of bonus is dependent
on achieving the US$ revenue target and 50% on achieving the EPS target. Maximum bonus is 125% of base salary depending on the personal
performance multiplier described above.
Existing option schemes
The grant of options under the existing share option schemes ceased once the new Deferred Annual Bonus Plan and the new Employee Equity
Plan were approved by shareholders at the 2006 AGM. These plans have the facility for option grants to be made, but this will be done only in
exceptional circumstances. The existing option grants to executive directors remain available for exercise and vesting in accordance with the rules
of the relevant schemes. In line with practice among the Group's peers in the technology sector, there are generally no performance conditions
attached to the issue or exercise of discretionary options under the existing schemes, except for those issued to executive directors where
performance conditions based on real EPS apply. Share options issued to executive directors prior to their appointment to the board of the Group
do not have performance conditions attached to them. However, discretionary options issued to executive directors after their appointment to the
board of the Group do have performance conditions attached to them. These discretionary options will vest after seven years, but may vest after
three years from grant if the performance conditions are satisfied.
The performance conditions applicable to the Long Term Incentive Plan are described in more detail below and are based on TSR rather than EPS,
providing the link to performance against an appropriate peer group.
These performance conditions were selected having regard to the position of the Group within its sector and the nature of the companies against
which it competes to attract and retain high calibre employees. The Committee believes that the performance conditions represent the correct
balance between being motivational and challenging.
Pensions
The Group does not operate its own pension scheme but makes payments into a Group personal pension plan, which is a money purchase scheme.
For executive directors, the rate of Group contribution is 10% of the executive's basic salary.
Service agreements
Executive directors have rolling  service contracts that may be terminated by either party on one year's notice. The service contracts also terminate
when executive directors reach age 65. These agreements provide for each of the directors to provide services to the Group on a full-time basis and
contain restrictive covenants for periods of three to six months following termination of employment relating to non-competition, non-solicitation of
the Group's customers, non-dealing with customers and non-solicitation of the Group's suppliers and employees. In addition, each service contract
contains an express obligation of confidentiality in respect of the Group's trade secrets and confidential information and provides for the Group to
own any intellectual property rights created by the directors in the course of their employment.
The dates of the service contracts of each person who served as an executive director during the financial year are as follows:
Director Date
Warren East 29 January 2001
Tim Score 1 March 2002
Tudor Brown 3 April 1996
Mike Inglis 17 July 2002
Mike Muller 31 January 1996
Simon Segars 4 January 2005
Sir Robin Saxby (retired 1 October 2006) 31 January 1996
Where notice is served to terminate the appointment, whether by the Group or the executive director, the Group in its absolute discretion shall be
entitled to terminate the appointment by paying to the executive director his salary in lieu of any required period of notice. 30 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006
Remuneration report/UK reporting/continued
Non-executive directors
During 2006, the Chairmen of the audit and remuneration committees and the senior independent director each received a total fee of  37,000 per
annum and the other non-executive directors each received a total fee of  33,000 per annum. These fees were arrived at by reference to fees paid
by other companies of similar size and complexity, and reflected the amount of time non-executive directors were expected to devote to the
Group's activities during the year, which is between 10 to 15 working days a year. The remuneration of the non-executive directors is set by the
board and the term of appointment is three years. Non-executive directors do not have service contracts, are not eligible to participate in bonus or
share incentive arrangements and their service does not qualify for pension purposes or other benefits. No element of their fees is performance-
related. Share options held by Lucio Lanza were granted prior to the Group's acquisition of Artisan and share options held by Mark Templeton (who
resigned on 25 July 2006) were granted prior to his change of status from executive to non-executive director in October 2005.
Performance graphs
A performance graph showing the Company's total shareholder return (TSR ) together with the TSR for the FTSE All-World Technology Index from
31 December 2001 is shown below. The TSR has been calculated in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. The TSR
for the Company's shares was -64% over this period compared with -17% for the FTSE All-World Technology Index for the same period.
ARM total shareholder return performance from 31 December 2001 to 31 December 2006
The directors consider the FTSE All-World Technology Index to be an appropriate choice as the Index contains companies from the US, Asia and
Europe and therefore reflects the global environment in which the Group operates. In addition, the Index includes many companies that are
currently the Group's customers, as well as companies which use ARM technology in their end products.

In addition to the interests disclosed above, all the executive directors (together with all the employees of the Group) are potential beneficiaries
of the ARM Holdings plc Employee Share Ownership Plan. They are, therefore, treated as interested in all the shares held by this trust, being
2,882,979 ordinary shares at 31 December 2006 and (5,000,000 ordinary shares at 31 December 2005). The executive directors also have interests
in dividend shares that could be awarded under the Long Term Incentive Plan, the amount of which will depend on the extent to which the
performance criteria are satisfied and the dividends declared during the performance period. There have been no changes in directors' interests
in the Company's shares to the date of approval of the remuneration report.

* The performance conditions applicable to the 2003 conditional awards were satisfied to the extent of 175.9% plus dividend shares as detailed below
** The performance conditions applicable to the 2004 conditional awards were not satisfied and these awards lapsed in January 2007. ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 35
Conditional awards vest to the extent that the performance criteria are satisfied over a three-year performance period from 1 January of the year
of award and no re-testing thereafter is possible. The performance conditions are based on the Company's TSR when measured against that of two
comparator groups (each testing half of the shares comprised in the award). The first index comprises UK companies across all sectors (FTSE 350)
and the second comprises predominantly US companies within the Hi Tech sector (FTSE Global Technology Index). For each comparator group, the
number of shares that may vest may be up to a maximum of 200% of the shares conditionally awarded if the Company's TSR ranks in the upper
decile, 50% will vest in the event of median performance and between median and upper decile performance vesting will increase on a straight-
line basis. Additional shares may vest to cover dividends paid by the Company during the performance period. No shares will be received for
below-median performance. In addition, no shares will vest unless the committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement
in the underlying financial performance of the Company.
The performance conditions applicable to the conditional awards granted on 25 July 2003 were satisfied to the extent of 175.9% plus dividend
shares which vested on 1 February 2006, as follows:
