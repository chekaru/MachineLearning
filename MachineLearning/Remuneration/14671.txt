As part of the process to refresh the board and its committees, Philip Rowley joined the remuneration committee on  
25 January 2011 and took over as Chairman in place of Jeremy Scudamore on 31 January 2011, Larry Hirst joined the 
committee and Kathleen O'Donovan stepped down as a member on 25 January 2011. In addition, John Scarisbrick retired

During the year, the activities of the committee included a review of potential advisers, after which T owers Watson were 
appointed by the committee and undertook a review of executive remuneration.
The committee' s other responsibilities include:
 	determining and agreeing with the board, within agreed terms of reference, the Group' s policy for the remuneration 
of the executive directors and the individual remuneration packages for each executive director. This includes basic 
salary, annual bonus, the level and terms of conditional awards under the Long T erm Incentive Plan and the terms of 
performance conditions that apply to such benefits, pension rights and any compensation payments;
 	making recommendations in relation to the remuneration of senior management including members of the executive 
committee; and
 	liaising with the board in relation to the preparation of the board' s annual report to shareholders on the Group' s policy on 
the remuneration of executive directors and in particular the directors' remuneration report, as required by the Companies 
Act 2006, the Combined Code on Corporate Governance 2008 and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority .
The committee' s terms of reference are published on the corporate website at www.arm.com. Given their diverse business 
experience, the independent non-executive directors who made up the committee in 2010 and the new members who joined 
the committee in 2011 offer a balanced view and international expertise in relation to remuneration matters for the Group.  Governance

Remuneration Review 2010
The committee has access to independent professional advice from external advisers in the furtherance of its duties and 
makes use of such advice. 
During 2010 after a review of potential advisers, T owers Watson were appointed by the committee and undertook a review 
of executive remuneration, including a detailed comparison of the composition of the remuneration packages for the 
executive directors and key senior managers against those offered by appropriate peer companies. Their main conclusion 
was that the base salaries were below median relative to other companies of similar market capitalisation. The amount 
of leverage was normal and total reward was constrained by the level of base salaries. The maximum bonus under the 
Deferred Annual Bonus Plan (DAB) was below the market norm and it was recommended that this be increased from  
125% to 150%. This change was approved by the remuneration committee in December 2010 to apply to bonuses 
earned in relation to the 2011 financial year onwards. This will bring maximum bonus for executive directors and executive 
committee members in line with the maximum bonus that can be achieved by the next level of management, who can also 
achieve a maximum bonus of 150% .
Base salary increase for 2010
For 2010 the average increase in base salaries for the executive directors was 3.3% and the average increase for the 
workforce as a whole was 3.58%.
Remuneration policy
The remuneration committee, in its deliberations on remuneration policy for the Group' s executive directors, seeks to give 
full consideration to the principles set out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance 2008. The committee is able to 
consider corporate performance on environmental, social and corporate governance issues when setting the remuneration 
of executive directors. The committee also monitors developments in accounting for equity-based remuneration on an 
ongoing basis.
The Group operates a remuneration policy and framework for executive directors designed to ensure that it attracts and 
retains the best high quality management skills necessary to achieve a high level of corporate performance, in line with 
the best interests of shareholders. This policy seeks to provide rewards and incentives for the remuneration of executive 
directors that reflect their performance and align with the objectives of the Group. These comprise a mix of performance-
related and non-performance-related remuneration. The committee believes that a director' s total remuneration should 
seek to recognise their worth in the external market and, to this end, obtains information from independently published 
remuneration surveys, benchmarks the total remuneration package and applies the following principles:
 	base salaries are set by reference to the market median, as part of a total remuneration package which has the potential 
to be upper quartile; 
 	a significant amount (i.e. more than 50%) of total potential remuneration is performance-related;
 	a significant element of performance-related remuneration is provided in the form of shares;
 	elements of performance-related variable remuneration are subject to deferral; and
 	the performance of divisional general managers is measured both at division and Group level.
Advisers
In addition to the appointment of T owers Watson, other advisers who provided services during 2010 were:
 	KPMG who provided general advice on remuneration and benefits, including tax advice for employees who are seconded 
overseas and they also worked on royalty audits; 
 	Linklaters who provided legal services in relation to equity plans and corporate matters; 
 	Monks who provided salary survey data; 
 	Deloitte who provided salary survey data, royalty audit services and tax training; and
 	Kepler Associates who provided independent verification of TSR calculations for the Long T erm Incentive Plan. 
Advisers are generally appointed by Bill Parsons, the EVP , Human Resources and are subject to review by the committee. 
The EVP , Human Resources also provided advice to the committee and to the Group in 2010. Monks is an associate of 
the Group' s external auditor and these services were approved by the audit committee in accordance with the procedure 
described in the Corporate Governance report. The Chief Executive Officer and the EVP , Human Resources, normally 
attend for part of remuneration committee meetings. No director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.  62  ARM Holdings plc Annual Report 2010
Shareholding guideline
A shareholding guideline is in place for executive directors and certain senior managers, who are required to build up a holding 
of shares in the Company over a period of five years. The shareholdings may include shares received through earlier grants 
under the Company' s share option schemes and/or the Long T erm Incentive Plan and/or the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan and, 
in the case of executive directors and members of the executive committee, the required holding is 100% of basic salary . 
Incentive arrangements
The remuneration committee aims to ensure that individuals are fairly rewarded for their contribution to the success of the 
Group. There are four key incentive schemes in operation within the Group. These are the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan 
(DAB) and Long T erm Incentive Plan (LTIP) for executive directors and senior managers and the Employee Equity Plan 
and Annual Bonus Plan for all other employees. These plans provide alignment between remuneration and the financial 
performance of the Group and strengthen retention of key employees through deferment of bonus. Option grants to 
executive directors ceased in 2006 (although the facility to grant options exists in exceptional circumstances) and the 
move away from options to restricted shares for all employees reduces potential dilution and has simplified remuneration 
arrangements. Since 2007, variable remuneration for executive directors and certain senior managers has consisted of two 
performance-related elements: annual bonus and a conditional award under the Long T erm Incentive Plan. 
Deferred Annual Bonus Plan (DAB)
There is a strong variable element to executive directors' remuneration and for 2010 a bonus of up to a maximum of 125% 
of base salary (after application of a personal performance multiplier which flexes the payment by 0.75 to 1.25) could be 
earned through the DAB if all targets were met. 
The strong performance of the Group in 2010 resulted in both of the two bonus targets being achieved, each of which  
was capable of triggering 50% of total bonus. For 2010 the US dollar revenue target was $548.7 million against which 
revenue of $631.3 million was achieved. The normalised operating profit (NOP) target range was from zero payout at  
 89.5 million up to 25% at  112.4 million and 50% at  120.0 million, all at the budget exchange rate of  1:US$1.65. 
Actual currency adjusted NOP was  150.1 million. These targets were set by the remuneration committee in December 
2009/January 2010 against the background of the extremely difficult trading conditions that prevailed in 2009 and the 
considerable uncertainty that existed in relation to global economic conditions and trading prospects for the semiconductor 
industry as a whole. It is to the credit of the executive team and all employees that these targets were exceeded in such a 
potentially difficult year. The bonuses payable to each executive director in respect of performance during 2010 are shown 
later in this report and are all at 125% of base salary, half of which was compulsorily deferred into shares for three years. 
Shares representing the deferred element of bonus earned in 2007 and awarded in 2008 vested in February 2011, with  
the maximum 2:1 ratio of matching shares being triggered.
The personal performance multiplier depends on the achievement of pre-determined objectives which are reviewed 
and approved by the committee each year. These include key strategic objectives related to each director' s role and 
responsibilities including compliance with the Management Charter which is designed to foster employee development, 
understanding of the overall vision and strategy of the Group and good governance. There is compulsory deferral into 
shares of 50% of the bonus earned and an opportunity to earn an equity match of up to 2:1, subject to achievement  
of an EPS performance condition. At the end of the three year deferral period the shares and any matching shares  
earned are satisfied first from treasury shares and then by newly issued shares.
The targets set by the committee for the DAB each year are intended to be stretching but motivational and average bonus 
paid to the executive directors over the past five years is 77.8% of salary (with a range from 38.6% payout in 2007 to 125% 
in 2010) as shown below:

ARM Holdings plc Annual Report 2010 63
Following the remuneration review conducted by T owers Watson and taking account of the relatively modest increases  
in base salary, the committee has taken the decision that the maximum potential bonus for 2011 onwards will increase  
to 150% of base salary (after application of the personal performance multiplier). This is regarded as fair taking account 
of the total remuneration packages available to the executive directors and the arrangements in place in peer group 
companies. For 2011, the committee has decided to adopt the same bonus target arrangement so that 50% of bonus  
will be dependent on achieving a US dollar revenue target and 50% on achieving a currency adjusted NOP target,  
which the committee believes have been set at challenging but motivational levels. 
At EPS growth equal to the increase in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) plus 4% per annum, the deferred shares will be 
matched on a 0.3:1 basis, rising to 2:1 when EPS growth is in excess of CPI plus 12% per annum. These targets are 
directly related to the Group' s financial results and encourage achievement of the Group' s short-term financial goals, while 
the deferral and matching elements encourage a longer term view of the success of the Group. The deferred shares can  
be forfeited in the event of gross misconduct and the matching shares are subject to forfeiture for bad leavers . 
Long T erm Incentive Plan (L TIP)
Annual grants to executive directors are normally made at a level equivalent to base salary. Conditional awards vest to the 
extent that the performance criteria are satisfied over a three-year performance period from 1 January of the year of award 
and no re-testing thereafter is possible. The performance conditions are based on the Company' s T otal Shareholder Return 
(TSR) when measured against that of two comparator groups (each testing half of the shares comprised in the award). The 
first index comprises UK companies across all sectors (FTSE 350) and the second comprises predominantly US companies 
within the hi-tech sector (FTSE Global T echnology Index). The committee approved the replacement of the FTSE Global 
T echnology Index (which ceased to exist at the end of February 2011) with the All World T echnology Index for assessing 
TSR for LTIP awards made in 2009 and subsequently. T owers Watson has confirmed that there is 99% correlation between 
the performance of the two indices. 
The performance criteria provide the link to performance against an appropriate peer group. For each comparator group, 
the number of shares that may vest may be up to a maximum of 200% of the relevant half of the shares comprised in the 
conditional award if the Company' s TSR ranks in the upper decile, 50% of the relevant half of the shares will vest in the 
event of median performance and between median and upper decile performance vesting will increase on a straight-line 
basis. Additional shares may vest to cover dividends paid by the Company during the performance period. No shares will 
be received for below-median performance. In addition, no shares will vest unless the committee is satisfied that there has 
been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group. 
Former share option schemes
The option grants to executive directors made up to 2006 remain available for exercise and vesting in accordance with 
the rules of the relevant schemes. They are subject to performance conditions which led to partial vesting after three years 
based on real EPS growth and the remainder vests after seven years. Any options issued to executive directors prior to 
their appointment to the board are not subject to performance conditions. The performance conditions relating to these 
remaining option grants are set out in more detail in the table later in this report.
Pensions
The Group does not operate its own pension scheme but makes payments into a Group personal pension plan, which is 
a money purchase scheme. For executive directors, the normal rate of Group contribution is 10% of the executive' s basic 
salary plus additional amounts in accordance with the Group' s salary sacrifice scheme. Full details of Group contributions 
are set out in the directors' emoluments table later in this report. In response to impending changes in legislation, the 
committee has agreed that, to the extent that contributions cannot be made in a tax efficient way at the 10% of basic salary 
level, the difference will be paid as an additional cash allowance (and subject to appropriate tax and other deductions). 64  ARM Holdings plc Annual Report 2010
Service agreements
Executive directors have service contracts that may be terminated by either party on one year' s notice. These agreements 
provide for each of the directors to provide services to the Group on a full-time basis and contain restrictive covenants 
for periods of three to six months following termination of employment relating to non-competition, non-solicitation of 
the Group' s customers, non-dealing with customers and non-solicitation of the Group' s suppliers and employees. In 
addition, each service contract contains an express obligation of confidentiality in respect of the Group' s trade secrets and 
confidential information and provides for the Group to own any intellectual property rights created by the directors in the 
course of their employment.
The dates of the service contracts of each person who served as an executive director during the financial year are  
as follows:
Director Date
Warren East 29 January 2001
Tim Score 1 March 2002
Tudor Brown 3 April 1996
Mike Inglis 17 July 2002
Mike Muller 31 January 1996
Simon Segars 4 January 2005
Where notice is served to terminate the appointment, whether by the Group or the executive director, the Group in its 
absolute discretion is entitled to terminate the appointment by paying to the executive director his salary in lieu of any 
required period of notice.
Non-executive directors
During 2010, the Chairmen of the audit and remuneration committees each received a total fee of  47,500 per annum and 
the other non-executive directors each received a total fee of  42,000 per annum. These fees were arrived at by reference 
to fees paid by other companies of similar size and complexity and reflected the amount of time non-executive directors 
were expected to devote to the Group' s activities during the year. The remuneration of the non-executive directors is set  
by the executive directors and the term of appointment is three years which can be rolled forward for a further period of 
three years and is then subject to annual review. Fees paid to non-executive directors are reviewed annually with effect  
from 1 January.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts, are not eligible to participate in bonus or share incentive 
arrangements and their service does not qualify for pension purposes or other benefits. No element of their fees is 
performance-related. 
Performance graphs
A performance graph showing the Company' s total shareholder return (TSR) together with the TSR for the FTSE All-World 
T echnology Index from 31 December 2005 is shown below. The TSR has been calculated in accordance with the Directors'

The directors consider the FTSE All-World T echnology Index to be an appropriate choice as the Index contains companies 
from the US, Asia and Europe and therefore reflects the global environment in which the Group operates. In addition,  
the Index includes many companies that are currently the Group' s customers, as well as companies which use ARM

anniversary, 50% maximum from second anniversary, 75% maximum from third anniversary, 100% maximum on fourth anniversary.
For options granted in 2004 the performance conditions requiring average real EPS growth of at least 33.1% were satisfied 
and 100% of the options vested on 1 February 2006 and 8 February 2007 respectively. For options granted in 2005 the 
performance conditions were satisfied to the extent that 89.44% of the options vested on 8 February 2008 and the balance 
will vest seven years from the date of grant.
For the final grant of options in 2006 the performance conditions were satisfied to the extent that 76.2% of the options 
vested on 8 February 2009 and the balance will vest seven years from the date of grant. The performance condition was 
that 50% of the shares under option would vest after three years if the Group achieved average real EPS growth of 12.5% 
over the performance period. If average real EPS growth of at least 33.1% had been achieved over the performance period, 
100% of the shares under option would have vested after three years. For average real EPS growth of between 12.5% and 
33.1% over the performance period, the number of shares vested after three years increased on a straight-line basis.
