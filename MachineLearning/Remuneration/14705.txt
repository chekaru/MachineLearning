set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010 and the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority. 
Remuneration Committee 
Our long-term objective is to ensure that the Group attracts, retains and motivates the leaders 
necessary to continue to create substantial shareholder value. To achieve this we must maintain 
competitive packages and ensure that rewards are linked to the achievement of the Group's 
financial and strategic objectives .

As part of the process to refresh the Board and its Committees, Philip Rowley joined the Remuneration Committee on 25 January 2011 
and took over as Chairman in place of Jeremy Scudamore on 31 January 2011, Larry Hirst joined the Committee and Kathleen O'Donovan 
stepped down as a member on 25 January 2011, and Andy Green joined the Committee on 25 February 2011. The Committee met three 
times during 2011. 
The Committee's responsibilities include: 
  determining and agreeing with the Board the Group's policy for the remuneration of the executive directors and members of the Executive 
Committee. This currently includes base salary, annual bonus, the level and terms of conditional awards under the Long Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP) and the performance conditions that apply to such benefits, pension contributions and any compensation payments;  
  establishing the performance measures and targets for the LTIP and the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan (DAB); 
  maintaining oversight of the Group's salary review processes to ensure consistency of application; and 
  reviewing the annual Remuneration report to shareholders, prior to its approval by the Board and by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting as required by the Companies Act 2006, the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010 and the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority. 
The Committee's terms of reference are published on the corporate website at www.arm.com. Given their diverse business experience, 
the independent non-executive directors who made up the Committee in 2011, offer a balanced view and international expertise in relation 
to remuneration matters for the Group. 
  
Remuneration Review 2011 
The Committee has access to independent professional advice in the furtherance of its duties and appointed Towers Watson as advisers 
in 2010. During 2011, the activities of the Committee included a review of executive remuneration in the context of the UK Corporate 
Governance regime, with input from Towers Watson on UK and US remuneration models. The Committee believes that it is important 
to select an appropriate peer group and methodology for these purposes and that benchmarking provides a useful reference point but 
not target ranges for salaries or other benefits. The Committee also strongly endorses the principle of reward for performance. 
2011 was another very successful year for the Group. We significantly out-performed our international peer group over the last three years 
which resulted in full vesting of both the LTIP and DAB awards made in 2009, when the share price was 99.75 pence per share. To put the 
awards that are currently outstanding under the LTIP and DAB into context, the share price was 205 pence per share at the time awards were 
made in 2010 and, following the subsequent sustained increase, the number of shares awarded under these plans in 2011 and 2012 are at much 
lower levels. The share price was 568 pence per share on 7 February 2012, being the day before the 2012 LTIP and DAB awards were made.  
During 2011, the Committee also considered: 
  what constitutes strong performance by executives and how best to reflect that in future in the Group's performance-based 
remuneration plans; 
  the impact of the changes to the tax treatment of pension contributions to UK pension schemes and the cap on total value of individual 
pension arrangements. It was agreed that, to the extent that Group contributions cannot be paid into an individual's pension scheme 
in a tax efficient way, the equivalent amount would be paid as an additional allowance, subject to normal payroll taxes;  
  policy on the retirement of Executive Committee members; and 
  governance guidelines and consultations. 
Base salary increase for 2011 and 2012 
For 2011, the average increase in base salaries for the executive directors was 4.4% and the average increase for the workforce as a whole was 
4.0%. For 2012 the average increases are 3.6% for the executive directors and 4.7% for the workforce as a whole. Within the overall increase 
the range was 3.4% for Europe rising to 9.2% in Asia reflecting local market conditions and salary inflation. 
Remuneration policy 
The Remuneration Committee, in its deliberations on remuneration policy for the Group's executive directors, seeks to give full consideration 
to the principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010. The Committee is able to consider corporate performance on 
environmental, social and corporate governance issues when setting the remuneration of executive directors. The Committee also monitors 
developments in accounting for equity-based remuneration on an ongoing basis and is studying the Government's proposed changes 
to executive pay governance and will be considering the implications for the Group. 
The Group operates a remuneration policy and framework for executive directors designed to ensure that it attracts, retains and motivates 
people with the management skills necessary to achieve its goal of sustained growth in corporate performance. We believe that this sustained 
growth can be successfully achieved only with a high level of employee engagement and motivation. Our policy seeks to provide rewards and 
incentives for the remuneration of executive directors that reflect their performance and align with the objectives of the Group. These comprise 
a mix of performance-related and non-performance-related remuneration. The Committee believes that a director's total remuneration should 
be monitored against their worth in the external market and, to this end, obtains information from independently published remuneration 
surveys, benchmarks the total remuneration package and applies the following principles: 
  base salaries are to be set at a competitive level; 
  a significant amount (i.e. more than 50%) of total potential remuneration is performance-related; 
  a significant element of performance-related remuneration is provided in the form of shares; 
  elements of performance-related variable remuneration are subject to deferral; and 
  the performance of divisional general managers is measured both at division and Group level.

Advisers 
In addition to Towers Watson, other advisers who provided services during 2011 were: 
  KPMG who provided general advice on remuneration and benefits, including tax advice for employees who are seconded overseas. 
They also provided royalty audit services; 
  Linklaters and Slaughter and May who provided legal services in relation to equity plans and corporate matters; 
  Monks who provided salary survey data; 
  Deloitte who provided salary survey data, royalty audit services and tax training; and 
  Kepler Associates who provided independent verification of TSR calculations for the Long Term Incentive Plan. 
Advisers have been appointed by Bill Parsons, the EVP, Human Resources and are reviewed and approved by the Committee. The EVP, 
Human Resources also provided advice to the Committee and to the Group in 2011. Monks is an associate of the Group's external auditor 
and these services were approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the procedure described in the Corporate governance report. 
The Chief Executive Officer and the EVP, Human Resources, normally attend for part of Remuneration Committee meetings. No director 
is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration. 
Shareholding guideline 
A shareholding guideline is in place for executive directors and certain senior managers, who are required to build up a holding of shares in the 
Company over a period of five years. The shareholdings may include shares received through earlier grants under the Company's share option 
schemes and/or the LTIP and/or the DAB and, in the case of executive directors and members of the Executive Committee, the required 
holding is 100% of base salary. 
Incentive arrangements 
The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that individuals are fairly rewarded for their contribution to the success of the Group. 
There are four key incentive schemes in operation across the workforce as a whole. These are the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan (DAB) and 
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for executive directors and senior managers and the Employee Equity Plan and Annual Bonus Plan for all 
other employees. These plans provide alignment between remuneration and the financial performance of the Group and strengthen retention 
of key employees through deferment of bonus. Option grants to executive directors ceased in 2006 (although the facility to grant options 
exists in exceptional circumstances) and the move away from options to restricted shares for all employees reduces potential dilution and has 
simplified remuneration arrangements. Since 2007, variable remuneration for executive directors and certain senior managers has consisted 
of two performance-related elements: annual bonus under the DAB and an annual conditional award under the LTIP. 
Deferred Annual Bonus Plan (DAB) 
There is a strong variable element to executive directors' remuneration and for 2011 a bonus of up to a maximum of 150% of base salary 
(after application of a personal performance multiplier which flexes the payment by 0.75 to 1.25) could be earned through the DAB if all 
targets were met. 
The strong performance of the Group in 2011 resulted in both of the equally weighted bonus targets being achieved. For 2011, the revenue 
target, which is set in US dollars reflecting the main currency in which revenues are earned, was $748 million against which revenue of 
$785 million was achieved. The normalised operating profit (NOP) target range was from zero payout at  164.2 million up to 25% at 
 182.8 million and 50% at  202.5 million, all at the Group budget exchange rate of  1:US$1.60. Actual NOP for 2011 was  218.8 million, again 
using the Group budget exchange rate. These targets were set by the Remuneration Committee in January 2011 against the background of 
continuing concerns about the global economy and the prospects for the semiconductor industry. It is to the credit of the executive team and 
all employees that these targets were exceeded in such a potentially difficult year. The bonuses payable to each executive director in respect of 
performance during 2011 are shown later in this report and are all at 150% of base salary, half of which was compulsorily deferred into shares 
for three years. Each of the executive directors achieved a personal performance multiplier in excess of 1.2.  
The personal performance multiplier depends on the achievement of pre-determined objectives which are reviewed and approved by the 
Committee each year. These include key strategic objectives related to each director's role and responsibilities including compliance with the 
Management Charter which is designed to foster employee development, understanding of the overall vision and strategy of the Group and 
good governance. There is compulsory deferral into shares of 50% of the bonus earned and an opportunity to earn an equity match of up to 
2:1, subject to achievement of an EPS performance condition. At the end of the three year deferral period the shares and any matching shares 
earned are satisfied through the issue of new shares (any treasury shares available would be used first). 
Shares representing the deferred element of bonus earned in 2008 and awarded in 2009 vested in February 2012, with the maximum 2:1 ratio 
of matching shares being triggered. This ratio was achieved because EPS growth was greater than CPI plus 12% per annum for each of the 
three years making up the performance period. 
 
 
The targets set by the Committee for the DAB each year are intended to be stretching but motivational and average bonus paid to the executive 
directors over the past five years was 75.2% of salary (with a range from 38.6% payout in 2007 to 150% in 2011) as shown below: 
Average percentage bonus paid over the past five years to executive directors 
 
Notes 
2010 bonus was limited to 125% of base salary under the DAB rules 
2011 bonus is within the new limit of 150% of base salary approved by the Remuneration Committee for 2011 onwards 
All bonuses are subject to a performance multiplier on an individual basis but remain subject to the overall limit of 150% 
 
For 2012, the Committee has decided to adopt the same bonus target arrangement so that 50% of bonus will be dependent on achieving a 
US dollar revenue target and 50% on achieving a NOP target calculated at the Group budget exchange rate of  1:US$1.60. The Committee 
believes that these targets have been set at levels that are challenging but achievable at high rates of performance. 
At EPS growth equal to the increase in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) plus 4% per annum, the deferred shares will be matched on a 
0.3:1 basis, rising to 2:1 when EPS growth is in excess of CPI plus 12% per annum. These targets are directly related to the Group's financial 
results and encourage achievement of the Group's short-term financial goals, while the deferral and matching elements encourage a longer 
term view of the success of the Group. The deferred shares can be forfeited in the event of gross misconduct and the matching shares are 
subject to forfeiture for bad leavers . 
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
Annual grants to executive directors are normally made at a level equivalent to base salary. Conditional awards vest to the extent that the 
performance criteria are satisfied over a three-year performance period from 1 January of the year of award, with no subsequent re-testing 
permitted. The performance conditions are based on the Company's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) when measured against that of two 
comparator groups (each testing half of the shares comprised in the award). The first index comprises UK companies across all sectors 
(FTSE 350) and the second comprises predominantly US companies within the hi-tech sector (FTSE All World Technology Index). 
The performance criteria provide the link to performance against appropriate peer groups. For each comparator group, the number of shares 
that may vest may be up to a maximum of 200% of the relevant half of the shares comprised in the conditional award if the Company's TSR 
ranks in the upper decile, 50% of the relevant half of the shares will vest in the event of median performance and between median and upper 
decile performance vesting will increase on a straight-line basis. Additional shares may vest to cover dividends paid by the Company during 
the performance period. No shares will be received for below-median performance. In addition, no shares will vest unless the Committee 
is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group.

good governance. There is compulsory deferral into shares of 50% of the bonus earned and an opportunity to earn an equity match of up to 
2:1, subject to achievement of an EPS performance condition. At the end of the three year deferral period the shares and any matching shares 
earned are satisfied through the issue of new shares (any treasury shares available would be used first). 
Shares representing the deferred element of bonus earned in 2008 and awarded in 2009 vested in February 2012, with the maximum 2:1 ratio 
of matching shares being triggered. This ratio was achieved because EPS growth was greater than CPI plus 12% per annum for each of the 
three years making up the performance period. 
 
 
The targets set by the Committee for the DAB each year are intended to be stretching but motivational and average bonus paid to the executive 
directors over the past five years was 75.2% of salary (with a range from 38.6% payout in 2007 to 150% in 2011) as shown below:

Notes 
2010 bonus was limited to 125% of base salary under the DAB rules 
2011 bonus is within the new limit of 150% of base salary approved by the Remuneration Committee for 2011 onwards 
All bonuses are subject to a performance multiplier on an individual basis but remain subject to the overall limit of 150% 
 
For 2012, the Committee has decided to adopt the same bonus target arrangement so that 50% of bonus will be dependent on achieving a

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
Annual grants to executive directors are normally made at a level equivalent to base salary. Conditional awards vest to the extent that the 
performance criteria are satisfied over a three-year performance period from 1 January of the year of award, with no subsequent re-testing 
permitted. The performance conditions are based on the Company's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) when measured against that of two 
comparator groups (each testing half of the shares comprised in the award). The first index comprises UK companies across all sectors 
(FTSE 350) and the second comprises predominantly US companies within the hi-tech sector (FTSE All World Technology Index). 
The performance criteria provide the link to performance against appropriate peer groups. For each comparator group, the number of shares 
that may vest may be up to a maximum of 200% of the relevant half of the shares comprised in the conditional award if the Company's TSR 
ranks in the upper decile, 50% of the relevant half of the shares will vest in the event of median performance and between median and upper 
decile performance vesting will increase on a straight-line basis. Additional shares may vest to cover dividends paid by the Company during 
the performance period. No shares will be received for below-median performance. In addition, no shares will vest unless the Committee 
is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group.

Former share option schemes 
The option grants to executive directors made up to 2006 remain available for exercise and vesting in accordance with the rules of the relevant 
schemes. They were subject to performance conditions which led to partial vesting after three years based on real EPS growth and the 
remainder vests after seven years. The performance conditions relating to these remaining option grants are set out in more detail in the table 
later in this report. 
Pensions 
The Group does not operate its own pension scheme but makes payments into a Group personal pension plan, which is a money purchase 
scheme. For executive directors, the normal rate of Group contribution is 10% of the executive's basic salary plus additional amounts in 
accordance with the Group's salary sacrifice scheme. Full details of Group contributions are set out in the directors' emoluments table later 
in this report. In response to changes in legislation, the Committee has agreed that from the beginning of 2011, to the extent that contributions 
cannot be made in a tax efficient way at the 10% of basic salary level, the difference will be paid as an additional cash allowance (and subject 
to appropriate tax and other deductions). 
Service agreements 
Executive directors have service contracts that may be terminated by either party on one year's notice. These agreements provide for each 
of the directors to provide services to the Group on a full-time basis and contain restrictive covenants for periods of three to six months 
following termination of employment relating to non-competition, non-solicitation of the Group's customers, non-dealing with customers 
and non-solicitation of the Group's suppliers and employees. In addition, each service contract contains an express obligation of confidentiality 
in respect of the Group's trade secrets and confidential information and provides for the Group to own any intellectual property rights created 
by the directors in the course of their employment. 
The dates of the service contracts of each person who served as an executive director during the financial year are as follows: 
Director  Date
Warren East  29 January 2001
Tim Score  1 March 2002
Tudor Brown  3 April 1996
Mike Inglis  17 July 2002
Mike Muller  31 January 1996
Simon Segars  4 January 2005
Where notice is served to terminate the appointment, whether by the Group or the executive director, the Group in its absolute discretion 
is entitled to terminate the appointment by paying to the executive director his salary in lieu of any required period of notice. 
Non-executive directors 
During 2011, the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees each received a total fee of  60,000 per annum and the other 
non-executive directors each received a total fee of  50,000 per annum. These fees were arrived at by reference to fees paid by other companies 
of similar size and complexity and reflected the amount of time non-executive directors were expected to devote to the Group's activities 
during the year. The remuneration of the non-executive directors is set by the executive directors and the term of appointment is three years 
which can be rolled forward for a further period of three years and is then subject to annual review. Fees paid to non-executive directors are 
reviewed annually with effect from 1 January and for 2012 the fees have increased to  65,000 for the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees and to  52,000 for the other non-executive directors.  
During 2011, the Board approved an additional fee of $2,500 per meeting which is paid to the two non-executive directors who are based in the 
US and travel to the UK for Board meetings. This is to reflect their additional time commitment.  
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts and are not eligible to participate in bonus or share incentive arrangements. 
Their service does not qualify for pension purposes or other benefits and no element of their fees is performance-related. 
  
Performance graphs 
A performance graph showing the Company's total shareholder return (TSR) together with the TSRs for the FTSE All-World Technology 
Index and the FTSE 350 from 31 December 2006 is shown below. The TSR has been calculated in accordance with the Directors' 
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. 
 
ARM total shareholder return performance from 31 December 2006 to 31 December 2011 
The TSR for the Company's shares was 401% over this period compared with 6% for the FTSE All-World Technology Index for the 
same period. 
The directors consider the FTSE All-World Technology Index to be an appropriate choice as the Index contains companies from the US, 
Asia and Europe and therefore reflects the global environment in which the Group operates. In addition, the Index includes many companies 
that are currently the Group's customers, as well as companies which use ARM technology in their end products.

Former share option schemes 
The option grants to executive directors made up to 2006 remain available for exercise and vesting in accordance with the rules of the relevant 
schemes. They were subject to performance conditions which led to partial vesting after three years based on real EPS growth and the 
remainder vests after seven years. The performance conditions relating to these remaining option grants are set out in more detail in the table 
later in this report. 
Pensions 
The Group does not operate its own pension scheme but makes payments into a Group personal pension plan, which is a money purchase 
scheme. For executive directors, the normal rate of Group contribution is 10% of the executive's basic salary plus additional amounts in 
accordance with the Group's salary sacrifice scheme. Full details of Group contributions are set out in the directors' emoluments table later 
in this report. In response to changes in legislation, the Committee has agreed that from the beginning of 2011, to the extent that contributions 
cannot be made in a tax efficient way at the 10% of basic salary level, the difference will be paid as an additional cash allowance (and subject
