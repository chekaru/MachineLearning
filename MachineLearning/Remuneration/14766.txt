The Directors Remuneration report Regulations 2002 (the Regulations ) require the auditors to report to the Company's
members on the auditable part  of the Directors' Remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of
the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations).
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information 
Remuneration Committee The responsibility for determining and approving the remuneration packages of the
Executive Directors and certain other senior Group managers has been delegated by the Board to the Remuneration
Committee (the Committee ) consisting solely of Non-Executive Directors of the Company. The Committee was
established on 24 November 2004 prior to which Executive Directors' remuneration was approved by the majority
shareholder, Granville Baird Capital Partners Limited following the management buy out of the Group on 26 November
2003. The Directors who served on the Committee during the reporting year were as follows: 
Sir Malcolm Rifkind (Committee Chairman and member of the Committee until 21 January 2005) and John Biles.
On his appointment to the Board on 21 January 2005 Iain Paterson was appointed to the Committee and replaced 
Sir Malcolm as the Committee's Chairman. Following Iain Paterson's appointment, the Committee currently comprises
two Non-Executive Directors, Mr Biles and Mr Paterson, both of whom the Board considers independent, in compliance
with the Combined Code.
The Committee reviews, on behalf of the Board, the remuneration policy for the Chairman and Executive Directors and,
more generally, the policy for share-based incentives in the Group. The Committee determines the level of remuneration,
incentives and other benefits, compensation payments and terms of employment of the Chairman and each Executive
Director. The Committee seeks to provide appropriate incentives to enhance performance and align the interests of 
the Executive Directors with those of shareholders. The Committee also reviews the salaries and benefits of other key
Senior Managers.
The Committee consults Sir Malcolm and Mr Hoffman in their capacities as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
respectively regarding proposals relating to the remuneration of other Executive Directors. The Company Secretary,
Christopher Beese, attends meetings as secretary to the Committee. Directors are not present when their own
remuneration is under discussion. The Committee has access to market research on remuneration. 
The Committee appointed, and continues to use, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP to provide advice on structuring
executive remuneration packages and the operation of share award schemes. New Bridge Street Consultants LLP does
not provide any other services to the Group. Jones Day provides legal advice on remuneration when required in
addition to other legal services to the Group. The Committee is satisfied that there is no conflict with the advice provided
and Jones Day's other connections with the Group.
Remuneration policy The remuneration policy of the Committee is ordinarily to provide Executive Directors and senior
executives with basic remuneration packages that are sufficient to recruit, retain and motivate executives in the light 
of the Company's needs and development objectives but to avoid paying more that is necessary for their service. 
The Committee monitors annually these remuneration levels against those paid in the market. For instance the most
recent review of Directors' remuneration used two comparator groups of companies as a benchmark: a group of
broadly similar-sized companies in terms of market capitalisation and turnover from the FTSE Support Services Sector 
and a larger group of similar sized companies across all sectors. The method used to define executive remuneration 
is used by the Group as a template for establishing management remuneration throughout the Group. 
Remuneration packages consist, to varying degrees as between individuals, of fixed elements - base salary, pension
entitlements and typical benefits in kind - and performance related elements - annual bonus schemes (linked to
Company and/or personal performance) and share based incentive schemes. The packages are designed to ensure
that a significant element of total remuneration is performance based. The Committee's aim for total remuneration is
that it should be at median levels compared to companies in a similar sector group.
Remuneration report If the performance is on target, the composition of each Director's remuneration will be as follows:
Name Non-performance related Performance related 
Executives
Jerry Hoffman 70% 30%
David Seaton 69% 31%
Noel Philp 70% 30%
Christopher Beese 70% 30%
Non-Executives
Sir Malcolm Rifkind 100% -
John Biles 100% -
Simon Havers 100% -
Iain Paterson 100% -
Base salaries The policy is for base salaries to be at a market median level.
Annual Bonus Schemes Under the service contracts entered into at the time of the management buy out in November
2003, the Company's four Executive Directors were entitled to a performance related annual bonus amounting to a
maximum of 25 per cent of their 2004 basic salary on achievement of specified Group EBITA targets. EBITA is defined as
earnings before interest, tax and amortisation of goodwill.
Prior to admission to the London Stock Exchange, on 8 December 2004, the Executive Directors' service contracts were
revised in order to provide each with a potential bonus of between 25 per cent and a maximum of 50 per cent of basic
salary, effective 1 January 2005, subject to performance criteria determined by the Committee based on the EBITA
achieved by the Group. Any performance bonus earned shall be paid in cash. 
Annual bonus awards are not pensionable. 
Long Term Incentives The Committee and the Board is firmly of the view that offering senior executives the opportunity
to be awarded shares in the Company is an important part of motivating and rewarding key employees so that they
may participate in the future growth in value of the Company.

New Share Plans and policy At a meeting of the Directors on 24 November 2004, the Company adopted the 
following employee share schemes (together the New Share Plans ) which were ratified by the Committee on 
29 November 2004: 
  the ArmorGroup Executive Share Option Plan (the Option Plan ); and
  the ArmorGroup Performance Share Plan (the PSP ). 
For the first set of awards under the New Share Plans concurrent grants have been made under the Option Plan and the
PSP subject to the limits on individual participation imposed by the rules of the Option Plan and PSP respectively. After this 
first set of grants it is intended that awards will be made under the PSP on an annual basis to a selected group of the
Company's most senior executives. If, after the first set of awards are made, grants are made under both the Option Plan
and PSP the Committee currently considers that the aggregate value of shares granted under the Option Plan and the
PSP in any one financial year must not exceed 100 per cent of an individual's base salary. 
The ArmorGroup Executive Share Option Plan The value of shares which can be placed under option to an individual
participant in any financial year is limited to 100 per cent of his base salary. 
Subject to this limit, the Committee will decide the level of grants in each year, reflecting the performance over the
preceding 12 months both of the individual and of the Company and considering general market practice at the time. 
An option will not normally be exercisable until three years after its grant provided that the Option holder remains a
Group employee. Options will lapse ten years from the date of grant or such shorter period as determined by the
Committee at the time of grant. Options normally lapse on cessation of employment. 
The performance conditions are based on the growth in the Company's earnings per share (EPS ) in excess of inflation.
EPS growth is measured over a three year period commencing with the EPS for the financial year ending immediately
prior to the date of grant. For options to vest in full, the average growth in EPS over a three year performance period
must equal or exceed inflation (measured by reference to the Retail Prices Index) by an average of at least 11 per cent
per annum. Options are to vest as to 25 per cent if average growth in EPS over a three year performance period equals
or exceeds inflation by an average of at least 8 per cent per annum. If average growth in EPS over a three year
performance period equals or exceeds inflation by an average of between 8 per cent and 11 per cent per annum, 
the options will vest on a straight-line basis between 25 per cent and 100 per cent. 
The ArmorGroup Performance Share Plan The operation of the PSP will be supervised by the Committee. The PSP is an
unapproved scheme that will be used to make awards of nil-cost options over Ordinary Shares that are subject to the
satisfaction of performance conditions and continued employment over a three year period. 
No awards may be granted in any financial year to an individual over shares whose value is greater than 100 per cent 
of an employee's base salary. Subject to this limit, the Committee will decide the level of awards in each year, reflecting
the performance over the preceding 12 months both of the individual and of the Company and considering general
market practice at the time. 
An award will normally vest on the third anniversary of its grant provided that the applicable performance condition has
been satisfied. 
Remuneration report (continued) Awards are subject to the Company's total shareholder return performance over the three years following grant
compared to that of a comparator group composed of the constituents of the FTSE SmallCap index. Awards are to 
vest as to 100 per cent for upper quartile performance and 25 per cent for median performance. Vesting will occur 
on a straight-line basis between these two points for performance between the median and the upper quartile. 
The Committee believes that the EPS performance condition for the Option Plan is appropriate because it requires
absolute share price growth before options may be exercised. The TSR performance condition for the PSP is considered
to be appropriate because it aligns the interests of Directors with shareholders by requiring superior total shareholder
return performance compared to the FTSE SmallCap Index. Together these two performance conditions provide a direct
link between rewards for senior executives and returns to shareholders and encourage senior executives to identify with
the longer term results of the Company reflected in the share price.
Old Share Plans Share options continue to subsist under the following two pre IPO incentive plans (together referred to
as the Old Share Plans ): 
  the ArmorGroup Unapproved Share Option Scheme; and
  the ArmorGroup Unapproved Share Option Scheme for Non-Executive Directors.
No further options are to be granted under the Old Share Plans. There are no performance criteria attached to the
exercise of these options since their terms were agreed prior to admission. Options awarded under these schemes vest in
three equal tranches over a three year period and lapse on cessation of employment or ten years after the grant date. 
Performance graph The following graph shows the total cumulative shareholder return on the Company's shares for 
the period from 14 December 2004 (the Admission date) to 15 April 2005 relative to a holding of shares representing the
FTSE Small Cap Index. The FTSE Small Cap index was selected by the Committee as the most representative index
appropriate for comparison, because it is a widely used and understood index of broadly similar size UK companies 
to the Company and is the comparator group being used for share awards to Directors and senior executives. 
Directors' pensions The Company provides pension contributions to all of its Executive Directors through money
purchase schemes only. Company contributions vary between Directors with Mr Hoffman receiving up to 33.3 per cent
of 5.0 per cent of his personal contribution through a US 401K plan, Mr Seaton receiving 12.5 per cent of his basic salary
and Messrs Philp and Beese receiving 15 per cent of their respective basic salaries due to their length of service with the
Group. Mr Hoffman, an American citizen, receives his contribution into a 401K plan in the USA, Mr Seaton has a private
pension and Messrs Philp and Beese are members of the Company's pension scheme through Clerical Medical. 
Only basic pay is pensionable.

Non-Executive Directors It is Company policy that Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the Company's
share, pension or bonus schemes post Admission. They are remunerated solely by fees that are reviewed against market
practice by the Executive Directors, the last review having taken place during the 2004 admission process. 
Prior to the Company's admission to the London Stock Exchange Sir Malcolm was awarded a number of share options
as detailed in the table of Directors' interests in share options on page 37. As stated above he is not eligible to receive
any further options. Fee levels are determined by a sub committee of the Board comprising the Chairman and Executive
Directors and reflect the commitment and responsibility of the role.

Remuneration report (continued) For Non-Executive Directors the Company's policy is to have written terms of appointment, with initial appointments
being until the first Annual General Meeting whereupon each shall retire and if re-elected be appointed for a further
three-year term, and in all cases appointments being terminable on three months' notice by either party. The written
terms of appointment are available for inspection at the Company's registered office and at the Company's Annual
General Meeting. 
Mr Havers, was appointed a Director of the Company on the 26 November 2003 on completion of the management
buy out by virtue of his position within Granville Baird Capital Partners Limited (GBCP ), the then majority shareholder 
of the Company. Mr Haver's original appointment made on 26 November 2003 was not subject to a finite term. 
These arrangements are detailed in formal agreements signed by all parties involved. On 8 December 2004 the
Company entered into agreements with GBCP and Mr Havers whereby GBCP agreed to provide the services of
Mr Havers to act as a Non-Executive Director of the Company, Mr Havers undertook directly with the Company to act in
this capacity.
Outside directorships The Company considers that it can often be of benefit to it if a Director, Executive or 
Non-Executive, holds directorships in other companies outside the Group, provided that any such appointment does 
not conflict with the Director's duties to the Company or with the Group's best interests. Before taking up any outside
appointment after becoming a Director of the Company, a Director must first seek the approval of the Board.
