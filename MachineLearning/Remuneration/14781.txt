Remuneration report
The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the Regulation ) require the auditors to report to the
Company's members on the auditable part  of the Directors' Remuneration Report and to state whether 
in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations). The report has therefore been divided into separate sections 
for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The responsibility for determining and approving the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and
certain other senior group managers has been delegated by the Board to the Remuneration Committee
(the Committee ) consisting solely of Non-Executive Directors of the Company. The Directors who served 
on the Committee during the year are as follows:
Sir Malcolm Rifkind  (Committee chairman and member of the Committee until 21 January 2005)
Iain Paterson (appointed Committee chairman on 21 January 2005)
John Biles
The Remuneration Committee reviews, on behalf of the Board, the remuneration policy for the Chairman and
Executive Directors and, more generally, the policy for share-based incentives in the Group. The Committee
determines the level of remuneration, incentives and other benefits, compensation payments and terms of
employment of the Chairman and each Executive Director. The Committee seeks to provide appropriate
incentives to enhance performance and align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of shareholders.
The Committee also reviews the salaries and benefits of other senior executives.
The Committee consults Sir Malcolm Rifkind and Jerry Hoffman in their capacities as Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer respectively regarding proposals relating to the remuneration of the other Executive
Directors. The Company Secretary, Christopher Beese, attends meetings as secretary to the Committee.
Directors are not present when their own remuneration is under discussion. The Committee has access to market
research on remuneration. 
The Committee continues to use New Bridge Street Consultants LLP to provide advice on structuring executive
remuneration packages and the operation of share award schemes. New Bridge Street Consultants LLP does
not provide any other services to the Group. Jones Day LLP provides legal advice on remuneration when
required in addition to other legal services to the Group. The Committee is satisfied that there is no conflict
with the advice provided and the adviser's other connections with the Group.
Remuneration policy
The remuneration policy of the Committee is ordinarily to provide Executive Directors and senior executives
with basic remuneration packages that are sufficient to recruit, retain and motivate executives in the light 
of the Company's needs and development objectives but to avoid paying more that is necessary for 
their service. The Committee monitors annually these remuneration levels against those paid in the market.
For instance the most recent review of Directors' remuneration used two comparator groups of companies
as a benchmark: a group of broadly similar-sized companies in terms of market capitalisation and turnover
from the FTSE Support Services Sector and a larger group of similar-sized companies across all sectors. 
The methodology used to define executive remuneration is used by the Group as a template for establishing
management remuneration throughout the Group. 
Remuneration packages consist, to varying degrees between individuals, of fixed elements - base salary,
pension entitlements and typical benefits in kind - and performance related elements - annual bonus
schemes (linked to Company and/or personal performance) and share-based incentive schemes. 
The packages are designed to ensure that a significant element of total remuneration is performance
based. The Committee's aim for total remuneration is that it should be at median levels compared to
companies in a similar sector group.
If performance is on target, the composition of each Executive Director's remuneration will be approximately
70 per cent non-performance related and 30 per cent performance related. The remuneration of the
Non-Executive Directors is solely non-performance related.
Base salaries
The policy is for base salaries to be at a market median level. ArmorGroup International plc Annual report and accounts 2005 34
Remuneration report (continued)
Annual bonus schemes
The Executive Directors service contracts provide each with a potential bonus of between zero and a
maximum of 50 per cent of basic salary, subject to performance criteria determined by the Committee
based on the Operating Profit achieved by the Group. Any performance bonus earned shall be paid in
cash. Annual bonus awards are not pensionable.
Long-term incentives
The Committee and the Board is firmly of the view that offering senior executives the opportunity to be
awarded shares in the Company is an important part of motivating and rewarding key employees so that
they may participate in the future growth in value of the Company.
New share plans and policy
The Company has adopted the following employee share schemes (together the New Share Plans ): 
  The ArmorGroup Executive Share Option Plan (the Option Plan ); 
  The ArmorGroup Performance Share Plan (the PSP ). 
The first set of awards under the New Share Plans were made on 16 March 2005 with concurrent awards
being made under the Option Plan and the PSP subject to the limits on individual participation imposed 
by the rules of the Option Plan and PSP respectively. It is currently intended that any future awards will be
made under the PSP on an annual basis to a selected group of the Company's executives and senior
management. There is no intention to make further grants under the Executive Share Option Plan in 2006 
to the current Executive Directors. If grants are made under both the Option Plan and PSP the Committee
currently considers that the aggregate value of shares granted under the Option Plan and the PSP in any
one financial year cannot exceed 100 per cent of an individual's base salary.
The ArmorGroup Executive Share Option Plan (the Option Plan ) 
The value of shares which can be placed under option to an individual participant in any financial year 
is limited to 100 per cent of his base salary. 
Subject to this limit, the Committee will decide the level of grants in each year, reflecting the performance
over the preceding 12 months both of the individual and of the Company and considering general market
practice at the time. 
An option will not normally be exercisable until three years after its grant provided that the Option holder
remains a Group employee. Options will lapse ten years from the date of grant or such shorter period as
determined by the Committee at the time of grant. Options normally lapse on cessation of employment. 
The performance conditions are based on the growth in the Company's earnings per share (EPS ) in 
excess of inflation measured over a three year period commencing with the EPS for the financial year
ending immediately prior to the date of grant. For options to vest in full, the average growth in EPS over 
a three year performance period must equal or exceed inflation (measured by reference to the Retail 
Prices Index) by an average of at least 11 per cent per annum. Options are to vest as to 25 per cent if
average growth in EPS over a three year performance period equals or exceeds inflation by an average 
of at least 8 per cent per annum. If average growth in EPS over a three year performance period equals 
or exceeds inflation by an average of between 8 per cent and 11 per cent per annum, the options will 
vest on a straight-line basis between 25 per cent and 100 per cent. 
The Committee believes that the EPS performance condition for the Option Plan is appropriate because 
it requires absolute earnings growth before options may be exercised.
The ArmorGroup Performance Share Plan (PSP )
The operation of the PSP will be supervised by the Committee. The PSP is an unapproved scheme used 
to make awards of nil-cost options over Ordinary Shares that are subject to the satisfaction of performance
conditions and continued employment over a three year period. 
No awards may be granted in any financial year to an individual over shares whose value is greater than
100 per cent of an employee's base salary. Subject to this limit, the Committee will decide the level of
awards in each year, reflecting the performance over the preceding 12 months both of the individual 
and of the Company and considering general market practice at the time. 
An award will normally vest on the third anniversary of its grant provided that the applicable performance
condition has been satisfied. 35
Awards are subject to the Company's total shareholder return performance over the three years following
grant compared to that of a comparator group composed of the constituents of the FTSE SmallCap Index.
Awards are to vest as to 100 per cent for upper quartile performance and 25 per cent for median
performance. Vesting will occur on a straight-line basis between these two points for performance 
between the median and the upper quartile. 
The TSR performance condition for the PSP is considered to be appropriate because it aligns the interests 
of Directors with shareholders by requiring superior total shareholder return performance compared to the
FTSE SmallCap Index.
Old Share Plans
The Group has outstanding share options under the following two pre IPO incentive plans (together referred
to as the Old Share Plans ):
  The ArmorGroup Unapproved Share Option Scheme; and
  The ArmorGroup Unapproved Share Option Scheme for Non-Executive Directors.
No further options are to be granted under the Old Share Schemes. There are no performance criteria
attached to the exercise of these options since their terms were agreed prior to admission. Options awarded
under these schemes vest in three equal tranches over a three year period and lapse on cessation of
employment or ten years after the grant date.
Performance graph
The following graph shows the total cumulative shareholder return on the Company's shares for the period
from 14 December 2004 (the Admission date) to 31 March 2006 relative to a holding of shares representing
the FTSE SmallCap Index. The FTSE SmallCap Index was selected by the Committee as the most representative
index appropriate for comparison, because it is a widely used and understood index of broadly similar size
UK companies to the Company and is the comparator group being used for share awards to Directors and
senior executives.
Directors' pensions
The Company provides pension contributions to all of its Executive Directors through money purchase
schemes only. 
Messrs Hoffman and Kappes receive contributions of up to one third of their personal contribution of 5 per cent
of salary through a US 401K plan.
Mr Seaton receives a contribution of 12.5 per cent of base salary with Messrs Philp and Beese receiving 
15 per cent due to their length of service with the Group. Mr Seaton has a private pension and Messrs Philp
and Beese are members of the Company's pension scheme. 
Only basic pay is pensionable.

Non-Executive Directors
It is Company policy following Admission that Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the
Company's share, pension or bonus schemes. They are remunerated solely by fees that are reviewed
against market practice by the Executive Directors, the last review having taken place in December 2005.
Prior to the Company's admission to the London Stock Exchange Sir Malcolm Rifkind was awarded a number
of share options as detailed in the table below of Directors' interests in share options. As stated above he 
is not eligible to receive any further options. Fee levels are determined by a sub-committee of the Board
comprising the Chairman and Executive Directors and reflect the commitment and responsibility of the role.

terminate automatically on the Director reaching the age of 65. No such restriction has been placed on 
Mr Hoffman. 
As detailed in the Chairman and Chief Executive's Statement,the Company announced on 16 March 2006
that Mr Hoffman will retire in the summer of 2006 and has agreed terms relating to his notice period and a

Director was re-elected for a further three-year term following the Group's first Annual General Meeting on 
26 May 2006. In all cases appointments being terminable on three months' notice by either party. The written
terms of appointment are available for inspection at the Company's registered office and at the Company's

Mr Havers was appointed a Director of the Company on the 26 November 2003 on completion of the
management buyout by virtue of his position within Granville Baird Capital Partners (GBCP ), the then
majority shareholder of the Company. 
These arrangements are detailed in formal agreements signed by all parties involved.
Outside directorships
The Company considers that it can often be of benefit to it if a Director, Executive or Non-Executive, 
holds directorships in other companies outside the Group, provided that any such appointment does not
conflict with the Director's duties to the Company or with the Group's best interests. Before taking up any
outside appointment after becoming a Director of the Company, a Director must first seek the approval 
of the Board.
