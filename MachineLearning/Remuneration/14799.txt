 ARMORGROUPANNUAL REPORT &ACCOUNTS 2007 [33]
REMUNERATION REPORT
The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (theRegulation )
require the auditors to report to the Company's members on the
auditable part of the Remuneration report and to state whether in their
opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance
with the CompaniesAct 1985 (as amended by the Regulations).The
report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited
and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The responsibility for determining and approving the remuneration
packages of the executive Directors and certain other senior group
managers has been delegated by the Board to the Remuneration
Committee (the Committee ),the responsibilities and composition
of which are detailed on page 25.
The Committee consults Sir Malcolm Rifkind and David Barrass in their
capacity as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer respectively regarding
proposals relating to the remuneration of the other Executive Directors.
Directorsarenotpresentwhentheirownremunerationisunderdiscussion.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The remuneration policy of the Committee is ordinarily to provide
Executive Directors and senior executives with basic remuneration
packages that are sufficient to recruit,retain and motivate executives
in the light of the Company's needs and development objectives but to
avoid paying more than is necessary for their service.The Committee
monitors annually these remuneration levels against those paid in the
market and uses New Bridge Street Consultants LLP in this regard.For
instance the most recent review of Directors'remuneration used two
comparator groups of companies as a benchmark:a group of broadly
similar-sized companies in terms of market capitalisation and turnover
from the FTSE Support Services Sector;and a larger group of similar
sized companies across all sectors.The methodology used to define
executive remuneration is used by the Group as a template for
establishing management remuneration throughout the Group.
Remuneration packages consist,to varying degrees between individuals,
of fixed elements - base salary,pension entitlements and typical benefits
in kind - and performance related elements - annual bonus schemes
(linked to Group and/or personal performance) and share-based
incentive schemes.The packages are designed to ensure that a
significant element of total remuneration is performance related.The
Committee's aim for total remuneration is that it should be at median
levels compared to companies in a similar sector group.
If performance is on target,the composition of each Executive Director's
remuneration will be approximately 70 per cent non-performance
related and 30 per cent performance related.The remuneration of the
Non-Executive Directors is solely non-performance related and is decided
by the Board as a whole.
BASE SALARIES
The policy is for base salaries to be at a market median level.
ANNUAL BONUS SCHEMES
The Executive Directors service contracts provide each with a potential
bonus of between zero and a maximum of 50 per cent of basic salary,
subject to performance criteria determined by the Committee based
on the Operating Profit achieved by the Group.Any performance bonus
earned shall be paid in cash.Annual bonus awards are not pensionable.
LONGTERM INCENTIVES
The Committee and the Board is firmly of the view that offering senior
executives the opportunity to be awarded shares in the Company is an
important part of motivating and rewarding key employees so that they
may participate in the future growth in value of the Company.
NEW SHARE PLANSAND POLICY
The Company has adopted the following employee share schemes
(together theNew Share Plans ):
TheArmorGroup Executive Share Option Plan (theOption plan );and
TheArmorGroup Performance Share Plan (thePSP ).
Three sets of awards under the New Share Plans have been made,
the first on 16 March 2005,again on 16 March 2006 and the third on
19 March 2007.Concurrent awards made under the Option Plan and the
PSP are subject to the limits on individual participation imposed by the
rules of the Option Plan and PSP respectively and for Executive Directors
are only considered upon their appointment.It is currently intended that
any future awards will be made under the PSP on an annual basis to a
selected group of the Company's executives and senior management.
There is no intention to make further grants under the Executive Share
Option Plan in 2008 to the current executive directors.
THEARMORGROUP EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION PLAN (THEOPTION PLAN )
The value of shares which can be placed under option to an individual
participantinanyfinancialyearislimitedto100percentofhisbasesalary.
Subject to this limit,the Committee will decide the level of grants in each
year,reflecting the performance over the preceding 12 months both of
the individual and of the Company and considering general market
practice at the time.
An option will not normally be exercisable until three years after its grant
provided that the Option holder remains a Group employee.Options
will lapse ten years from the date of grant or such shorter period as
determined by the Committee at the time of grant.Options normally
lapse on cessation of employment.
Directors'Report:Corporate Governance [34]ARMORGROUPANNUAL REPORT &ACCOUNTS 2007
REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
The performance conditions are based on the growth in the Company's
earnings per share (EPS ) in excess of inflation measured over a three
year period commencing with the EPS for the financial year ending
immediately prior to the date of grant.For options to vest in full,the
average growth in EPS over a three year performance period must equal
or exceed inflation (measured by reference to the Retail Prices Index)
by an average of at least eleven per cent per annum.Options are to vest
as to 25 per cent if average growth in EPS over a three year performance
period equals or exceeds inflation by an average of at least eight per
cent per annum.If average growth in EPS over a three year performance
period equals or exceeds inflation by an average of between eight per
cent and eleven per cent per annum,the options will vest on a straight
line basis between 25 per cent and 100 per cent.
The Committee believes that the EPS performance condition for the
Option Plan is appropriate because it requires absolute earnings growth
before options may be exercised.
THEARMORGROUP PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN (PSP )
The operation of the PSP is supervised by the Committee.The PSP
is an unapproved scheme used to make awards of nil-cost options
over Ordinary Shares that are subject to the satisfaction of performance
conditions and continued employment over a three year period.
No awards may be granted in any financial year to an individual over
shares whose value is greater than 100 per cent of an employee's base
salary.Subject to this limit,the Committee will decide the level of awards
in each year,reflecting the performance over the preceding twelve
months both of the individual and of the Company and considering
general market practice at the time.
An award will normally vest on the third anniversary of its grant provided
that the applicable performance condition has been satisfied.
Awards are subject to the Company'sTotal Shareholder Return (TSR )
performance over the three years following grant compared to that of a
comparator group composed of the constituents of the FTSE SmallCap
index.Awards are to vest as to 100 per cent for upper quartile
performance and 25 per cent for median performance.Vesting will
occur on a straight line basis between these two points for performance
between the median and the upper quartile.
TheTSRperformanceconditionforthePSPisconsideredtobeappropriate
because it aligns the interests of directors with shareholders by requiring
superior total shareholder return performance compared to the FTSE
SmallCap Index.
OLD SHARE PLANS
The Group has outstanding share options under the following two pre
IPO incentive plans (together referred to as theOld Share Plans ):
TheArmorGroup Unapproved Share Option Scheme;and
TheArmorGroup Unapproved Share Option Scheme for
Non-Executive Directors.
No further options are to be granted under the Old Share Plans:no
options have been granted under these schemes since the IPO.There are
no performance criteria attached to the exercise of these options since
their terms were agreed prior to admission.Options awarded under these
schemes vest in three equal tranches over a three year period and lapse
on cessation of employment or ten years after the grant date.
PERFORMANCE GRAPH
The following graph shows the total cumulative shareholder return on the
Company's shares for the period from 14 December 2004 (theAdmission
date) to 31 December 2007 relative to a holding of shares representing
the FTSE Small Cap Index.The FTSE Small Cap index was selected by the
Committee as the most representative index appropriate for comparison,
because it is a widely used and understood index of broadly similar size
UK companies to the Company and is the comparator group being used
for share awards to Directors and senior executives.
