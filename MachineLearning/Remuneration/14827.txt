Remuneration report
37
The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the Regulation ) require the auditors to report to the Company's
members on the auditable part  of the Directors' Remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the
report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations). The report
has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The responsibility for determining and approving the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and certain other senior
group managers has been delegated by the Board to the Remuneration Committee (the Committee ) the responsibilities 
and composition of which are detailed on page 33.
The Committee consults Sir Malcolm Rifkind and David Seaton in their capacity as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
respectively regarding proposals relating to the remuneration of the other Executive Directors. Directors are not present when
their own remuneration is under discussion. 
Remuneration policy
The remuneration policy of the Committee is ordinarily to provide Executive Directors and senior executives with basic
remuneration packages that are sufficient to recruit, retain and motivate executives in the light of the Company's needs and
development objectives but to avoid paying more than is necessary for their service. The Committee monitors annually these
remuneration levels against those paid in the market and uses New Bridge Street Consultants LLP in this regard. For instance the
most recent review of Directors' remuneration used two comparator groups of companies as a benchmark: a group of broadly
similar-sized companies in terms of market capitalisation and turnover from the FTSE Support Services Sector and a larger group
of similar sized companies across all sectors. The methodology used to define executive remuneration is used by the Group 
as a template for establishing management remuneration throughout the Group.
Remuneration packages consist, to varying degrees between individuals, of fixed elements - base salary, pension entitlements
and typical benefits in kind - and performance related elements - annual bonus schemes (linked to Company and/or personal
performance) and share based incentive schemes. The packages are designed to ensure that a significant element of total
remuneration is performance based. The Committee's aim for total remuneration is that it should be at median levels
compared to companies in a similar sector group.
If performance is on target, the composition of each Executive Director's remuneration will be approximately 70 per cent 
non-performance related and 30 per cent performance related. The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is solely 
non-performance related and is decided by the Board as a whole.
Base salaries
The policy is for base salaries to be at a market median level.
Annual bonus schemes
The Executive Directors' service contracts provide each with a potential bonus of between zero and a maximum of 50 per cent
of basic salary, subject to performance criteria determined by the Committee based on the Operating Profit achieved by the
Group. Any performance bonus earned shall be paid in cash. Annual bonus awards are not pensionable.
Long-term incentives
The Committee and the Board is firmly of the view that offering senior executives the opportunity to be awarded shares in the
Company is an important part of motivating and rewarding key employees so that they may participate in the future growth 
in value of the Company. ArmorGroup International plc Annual report and accounts 2006

New Share Plans and policy
The Company has adopted the following employee share schemes (together the New Share Plans ):
- The ArmorGroup Executive Share Option Plan (the Option plan ); and
- The ArmorGroup Performance Share Plan (the PSP ).
Three sets of awards under the New Share Plans have been made, the first on 16 March 2005, again on 16 March 2006 and 
the third on 21 March 2007. Concurrent awards made under the Option Plan and the PSP are subject to the limits on individual
participation imposed by the rules of the Option Plan and PSP respectively and for Executive Directors are only considered
upon their appointment. It is currently intended that any future awards will be made under the PSP on an annual basis to a
selected group of the Company's executives and senior management. There is no intention to make further grants under the
Executive Share Option Plan in 2007 to the current Executive Directors.
The ArmorGroup Executive Share Option Plan (the Option Plan ) 
The value of shares which can be placed under option to an individual participant in any financial year is limited to 100 per
cent of his base salary.
Subject to this limit, the Committee will decide the level of grants in each year, reflecting the performance over the preceding
12 months both of the individual and of the Company and considering general market practice at the time.
An option will not normally be exercisable until three years after its grant provided that the Option holder remains a Group
employee. Options will lapse ten years from the date of grant or such shorter period as determined by the Committee at the
time of grant. Options normally lapse on cessation of employment.
The performance conditions are based on the growth in the Company's earnings per share (EPS ) in excess of inflation
measured over a three year period commencing with the EPS for the financial year ending immediately prior to the date of
grant. For options to vest in full, the average growth in EPS over a three year performance period must equal or exceed inflation
(measured by reference to the Retail Prices Index) by an average of at least 11 per cent per annum. Options are to vest as to
25 per cent if average growth in EPS over a three year performance period equals or exceeds inflation by an average of at
least 8 per cent per annum. If average growth in EPS over a three year performance period equals or exceeds inflation by an
average of between 8 per cent and 11 per cent per annum, the options will vest on a straight line basis between 
25 per cent and 100 per cent.
The Committee believes that the EPS performance condition for the Option Plan is appropriate because it requires absolute
earnings growth before options may be exercised.
The ArmorGroup Performance Share Plan (PSP )
The operation of the PSP will be supervised by the Committee. The PSP is an unapproved scheme used to make awards of 
nil-cost options over Ordinary Shares that are subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions and continued employment
over a three year period.
No awards may be granted in any financial year to an individual over shares whose value is greater than 100 per cent of 
an employee's base salary. Subject to this limit, the Committee will decide the level of awards in each year, reflecting the
performance over the preceding 12 months both of the individual and of the Company and considering general market
practice at the time.
An award will normally vest on the third anniversary of its grant provided that the applicable performance condition has 
been satisfied. ArmorGroup International plc Annual report and accounts 2006
39
Awards are subject to the Company's Total Shareholder Return (TSR ) performance over the three years following grant
compared to that of a comparator group composed of the constituents of the FTSE SmallCap index. Awards are to vest as to
100 per cent for upper quartile performance and 25 per cent for median performance. Vesting will occur on a straight line basis
between these two points for performance between the median and the upper quartile.
The TSR performance condition for the PSP is considered to be appropriate because it aligns the interests of Directors with
shareholders by requiring superior total shareholder return performance compared to the FTSE SmallCap Index.
Old Share Plans
The Group has outstanding share options under the following two pre IPO incentive plans (together referred to as the 
Old Share Plans ):
- The ArmorGroup Unapproved Share Option Scheme; and
- The ArmorGroup Unapproved Share Option Scheme for Non-Executive Directors.
No further options are to be granted under the Old Share Plans: no options have been granted under these schemes since the
IPO. There are no performance criteria attached to the exercise of these options since their terms were agreed prior to
admission. Options awarded under these schemes vest in three equal tranches over a three year period and lapse on
cessation of employment or ten years after the grant date.
Performance graph
The following graph shows the total cumulative shareholder return on the Company's shares for the period from 14 December
2004 (the Admission date) to 23 March 2007 relative to a holding of shares representing the FTSE SmallCap Index. The FTSE
SmallCap index was selected by the Committee as the most representative index appropriate for comparison, because it is a
widely used and understood index of broadly similar size UK companies to the Company and is the comparator group being
used for share awards to Directors and senior executives.
Directors' pensions
The Company provides pension contributions to all of its Executive Directors through money purchase schemes only.
Mr Hoffman, who retired from the Board in July 2006, received contributions of up to one third of his personal contribution of 5
per cent of salary through a US 401K plan.
Messrs Seaton, Philp and Beese receive contributions of 15 per cent of base salary due to their length of service with the Group,
while Mr Brabin receives 12.5 per cent. Mr Seaton has a private pension and Messrs Philp, Brabin and Beese are members of the
Company's pension scheme through Scottish Life. The Company is in the process of transferring its pension arrangement with
Scottish Life from an occupational money purchase scheme to a group personal pension scheme.
Only basic pay is pensionable.

Non-Executive Directors
It is Company policy that Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the Company's share, pension or bonus schemes.
They are remunerated solely by fees that are reviewed against market practice by the Executive Directors, the last review
having taken place in December 2006.
Prior to the Company's admission to the London Stock Exchange Sir Malcolm Rifkind was awarded a number of share options
as detailed in the table below of Directors' interests in share options. As stated above he is not eligible to receive any further
options. Fee levels are determined by a sub-committee of the Board comprising the Chairman and Executive Directors and
reflect the commitment and responsibility of the role.

For Non-Executive Directors the Company's policy is to have written terms of appointment. Each Non-Executive Director 
was re-elected for a further three-year term following the Group's first Annual General Meeting on 27 May 2005. In all cases
appointments being terminable on three months' notice by either party. The written terms of appointment are available for
inspection at the Company's registered office and at the Company's Annual General Meeting.
Mr Havers, was appointed a Director of the Company on 26 November 2003 on completion of the management buyout 
by virtue of his position within Granville Baird Capital Partners (GBCP ), now renamed Baird Capital Partners Europe (BCPE ),
the then majority shareholder of the Company.
These arrangements are detailed in formal agreements signed by all parties involved.
Outside directorships
The Company considers that it can often be of benefit to it if a Director, Executive or Non-Executive, holds directorships in other
companies outside the Group, provided that any such appointment does not conflict with the Director's duties to the
Company or with the Group's best interests. Before taking up any outside appointment after becoming a Director of the
Company, a Director must first seek the approval of the Board.
