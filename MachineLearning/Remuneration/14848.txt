Remuneration Report

Scope of report 
The Remuneration Report sets out the Company's remuneration policy and, particularly, its approach for Directors. It also explains 
how the Company applies the principles of good corporate governance in relation to remuneration. This Report has been prepared  
by the Remuneration Committee and has been approved by the Board. 
Composition and role 
The Remuneration Committee's members are Steve Bodger, who is the Chairman, and Bob Morton. The Committee is responsible 
for reviewing all senior executive appointments and determining the Group's policy in respect of the terms of employment, including 
remuneration packages of executive Directors and for monitoring senior management development programmes. The constitution 
and operation of the Committee are in compliance with the principles of the Combined Code (Code ). The Committee has given full 
consideration to the best practice provisions set out in the Code in determining the remuneration packages for executive Directors. 
Remuneration policy 
The objective of the Group's remuneration policy is to attract, motivate and retain high quality individuals who will contribute fully  
to the success of the Group. To achieve this objective, the Group provides competitive salaries and benefits to all employees. 
Packages are established having regard to current market practice. 
Executive Directors' remuneration is set to create an appropriate balance between both fixed and performance-related elements. 
Performance-related elements are intended to comprise a significant part of potential remuneration. Remuneration is reviewed  
each year in light of the Group's business objectives. It is the Remuneration Committee's intention that remuneration should reward 
achievement of objectives and that these are aligned with shareholders' interests over the medium-term. 
Remuneration consists of the following elements: 
  Basic salary; 
  Performance-related annual bonus; 
  Benefits; 
  Defined contribution pension payments; and 
  Share options. 
Bonuses and benefits 
The executive Directors' bonus scheme is linked to the Group's year-on-year profit performance and working capital management. 
Divisional performance-related bonus schemes are in place so that bonuses may be payable to senior executives provided their 
divisional results reach pre-set profit and cash generation targets. 
Senior executives' benefits typically, but not necessarily, include a car (or cash alternative) and insurance for life, disability  
and health care. 
Share options 
The Company has a number of share option schemes, details of which are in Note 25 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Under these schemes, share options have been granted to the executive Directors and senior executives within the Group. 
The grant of share options is a recognised mechanism, practiced by the Company, to encourage continual improvement and align  
the interests and objectives of the senior management team with those of shareholders over the medium-term. 
In its review of share options, the Remuneration Committee is mindful of recommended practice, which is taken into account with 
other factors that include: 
  The available headroom under the schemes for new grants; 
  The price of previously granted options and whether these continue to act as the intended incentive; and 
  Share price movements as compared to the Group's performance. 
Pension arrangements 
The majority of senior executives are members of a defined contribution pension plan operated by the Group or, alternatively,  
have their own personal pension arrangements to which the Group contributes between 7% and 10% of pensionable salary.    Annual Report 2009
