REMUNERATION REPORT

SCOPE OF REPORT 
The Remuneration Report sets out the Company's remuneration policy and, particularly, its approach for Directors. It also 
explains how the Company applies the principles of good corporate governance in relation to remuneration. This Report 
has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and has been approved by the Board. 
COMPOSITION AND ROLE 
The Remuneration Committee's members are Steve Bodger, who is the Chairman, and Bob Morton. The Committee 
is responsible for reviewing all senior executive appointments and determining the Group's policy in respect of the 
terms of employment, including remuneration packages of executive Directors and for monitoring senior management 
development programmes. The constitution and operation of the Committee are in compliance with the principles, 
which are incorporated in Schedule A of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code ). The Committee has given 
full consideration to the best practice provisions set out in the Code in determining the remuneration packages for 
executive Directors. 
REMUNERATION POLICY 
The objective of the Group's remuneration policy is to attract, motivate and retain high quality individuals who will 
contribute fully to the success of the Group. To achieve this objective, the Group provides competitive salaries and benefits 
to all employees. Packages are established having regard to current market practice. 
Executive Directors' remuneration is set to create an appropriate balance between both fixed and performance-related 
elements. Performance-related elements are intended to comprise a significant part of potential remuneration. 
Remuneration is reviewed each year in light of the Group's business objectives. It is the Remuneration Committee's 
intention that remuneration should reward achievement of objectives and that these are aligned with shareholders' 
interests over the medium term. 
Remuneration consists of the following elements: 
  Basic salary; 
  Performance-related annual bonus; 
  Benefits; 
  Defined contribution pension payments; and 
  Share options. 
BONUSES AND BENEFITS 
The executive Directors' bonus scheme is linked to the Group's year-on-year profit performance and working 
capital management. 
Divisional performance-related bonus schemes are in place so that bonuses may be payable to senior executives provided 
their divisional results reach pre-set profit and cash generation targets. 
Senior executives' benefits typically, but not necessarily, include a car (or cash alternative) and insurance for life, disability 
and health care. 
SHARE OPTIONS 
The Company has a number of share option schemes, details of which are in Note 26 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. Under these schemes, share options have been granted to the executive Directors and senior executives 
within the Group. 
The grant of share options is a recognised mechanism, practiced by the Company, to encourage continual improvement 
and align the interests and objectives of the senior management team with those of shareholders over the medium term.  Armour Group plc

REMUNERATION REPORT

In its review of share options, the Remuneration Committee is mindful of recommended practice, which is taken into 
account with other factors that include: 
  The available headroom under the schemes for new grants; 
  The price of previously granted options and whether these continue to act as the intended incentive; and 
  Share price movements as compared to the Group's performance. 
PENSION ARRANGEMENTS 
The majority of senior executives are members of a defined contribution pension plan operated by the Group or, 
alternatively, have their own personal pension arrangements to which the Group contributes between 7% and 11% 
of pensionable salary. 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' SERVICE CONTRACTS 
The executive Directors have service contracts with the Company, which are not of fixed duration and are terminable 
by either party giving twelve months' written notice. 
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
There are service contracts with the Company for the provision of non-executive Directors' services, which may be 
terminated by either party giving three months' written notice. The fees payable for the services of the non-executive 
Directors are set by the Board. 
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION 
The following table summarises the total gross remuneration, excluding gains on the exercise of options, of the Directors 
who served during the year ended 31 August 2011:

The above figures represent remuneration earned as Directors during the relevant year. 
The executive Directors' basic salaries have remained unchanged for the fourth consecutive year, and no bonuses have 
been awarded over that period. Benefits relate to the assessable taxation benefits arising from a company car allowance 
and insurance for life, disability and health care. The reduction in benefits in the current year reflects reduced 
insurance cost. 
The non-executive Directors have reduced their fees for the year ending 31 August 2011. 
Fees for Bob Morton's services, inclusive of all expenses, are payable to Hawk Consulting Limited, a company in which 
he has an interest. 
Fees for Steve Bodger's services are payable to Stratys Limited, a company in which he has an interest. 
The figures for pensions shown above are the contributions paid by the Company. 
Neither George Dexter nor John Harris exercised any options during the current or prior year.  Business Review Governance Financial Statements Annual General Meeting
