Remuneration Report

Scope of Report 
The Remuneration Report sets out the Company's remuneration policy and, particularly, its approach for Directors. It also explains how the 
Company applies the principles of good corporate governance in relation to remuneration. This Report has been prepared by the 
Remuneration Committee and has been approved by the Board. 
Composition and role 
The Remuneration Committee's members are Steve Bodger, who is the Chairman, and Bob Morton. The Committee is responsible for 
reviewing all senior executive appointments and determining the Group's policy in respect of the terms of employment, including remuneration 
packages of executive Directors and for monitoring senior management development programmes. The operation of the Committee is in 
compliance with the principles, which are incorporated in Schedule A of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code ). The Committee has 
given full consideration to the best practice provisions set out in the Code in determining the remuneration packages for executive Directors. 
Remuneration policy 
The objective of the Group's remuneration policy is to attract, motivate and retain high quality individuals who will contribute fully to the success 
of the Group. To achieve this objective, the Group provides competitive salaries and benefits to all employees. Packages are established having 
regard to current market practice. 
Executive Directors' remuneration is set to create an appropriate balance between both fixed and performance-related elements. Performance-
related elements are intended to comprise a significant part of potential remuneration. Remuneration is reviewed each year in light of the 
Group's business objectives. It is the Remuneration Committee's intention that remuneration should reward achievement of objectives and that 
these are aligned with shareholders' interests over the medium term. 
Remuneration consists of the following elements: 
  Basic salary; 
  Performance-related annual bonus; 
  Benefits; 
  Defined contribution pension payments; and 
  Share options. 
Bonuses and benefits 
The executive Directors' bonus scheme is linked to the Group's year on year profit performance and working capital management. 
Divisional performance-related bonus schemes are considered on the basis that bonuses may be payable to senior executives provided their 
divisional results reach pre-set profit and cash generation targets. 
Senior executives' benefits typically, but not necessarily, include a car (or cash alternative) and insurance for life, disability and health care. 
Share options 
The Company has a number of share option schemes, details of which are in Note 26 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Under these 
schemes, share options have been granted to the executive Directors and senior executives within the Group. 
At the Company's last Annual General Meeting held on 31 January 2012, the Armour 2012 Company Share Option Plan for approved and 
unapproved options (the Option Plan ) was approved and established subject to subsequent approval by HMRC in regard to the grant of 
approved options. The Directors were authorised to make such amendments to the Option Plan as required by HMRC to obtain approval. 
The Option Plan has been approved by HMRC and formally adopted by the Company, but no options have been granted.  
The grant of share options is a recognised mechanism, practiced by the Company, to encourage continual improvement and align the interests 
and objectives of the senior management team with those of shareholders over the medium term. 
In its review of share options, the Remuneration Committee is mindful of recommended practice, which is taken into account with other factors 
that include: 
  The available headroom under the schemes for new grants; 
  The price of previously granted options and whether these continue to act as the intended incentive; and 
  Share price movements as compared to the Group's performance. 
Pension arrangements 
The majority of senior executives are members of a defined contribution pension plan operated by the Group or, alternatively, have their own 
personal pension arrangements to which the Group contributes between 7% and 11% of pensionable salary. 
Executive directors' service contracts 
The executive Directors have service contracts with the Company, which are not of fixed duration and are terminable by either party giving 
twelve months' written notice. 
Non-executive directors 
There are service contracts with the Company for the provision of non-executive Directors' services, which may be terminated by either party 
giving three months' written notice. The fees payable for the services of the non-executive Directors are set by the Board.  Remuneration Report continued
