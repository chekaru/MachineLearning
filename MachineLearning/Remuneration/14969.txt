 1 Introduction
All matters relating to the remuneration of the executive Directors are determined by the Remuneration Committee. Membership of the Committee 
is restricted to the non-executive Directors and for the year under review comprised Mr. M.J. Allen (Chairman of the Committee), Mr. W.G. Cooper, 
Mr. J.S. Ward (until 26 April 2002) and Mrs. A.V.M. Palmer. The objective of the Remuneration Committee is to ensure that the executive Directors are
both highly motivated and fairly rewarded for their contribution to the Group's overall performance having due regard to the interests of the
shareholders, the overall remuneration structure within the Group and practices adopted by comparator companies.
In assessing the remuneration of the Directors, the Remuneration Committee pays particular attention to the value added to shareholders' interests 
by the Company when compared with suitable comparator groups.
The graph below charts the performance of the Arriva Total Shareholder Return (share value growth plus re-invested dividends) over the past 5 years
compared with that of:
(a) The FTSE 250; and
(b) The FTSE 350 Transport Sector
TSR Return: Arriva plc vs Median FTSE Indices 1998 - 2002
In assessing the performance of the Company's Total Shareholder Return the Board believes the two comparator groups it has chosen represent a fair
benchmark both in terms of the nature of the business activity and size of company. 
The Remuneration Committee considers all elements comprising executive remuneration, including basic salary, performance related remuneration,
awards under the Company's Long Term Incentive Plan, pension provision, benefits in kind and service agreement terms.
The executive Directors are each paid a salary which is open to annual review in January. The Directors received no increase in their annual salaries at 
the January 2002 review; in January 2003 the salaries of the executive Directors were increased by 3%. In addition the executive Directors participate in
a performance related pay arrangement with payment being made on the attainment of specified targets established by the Remuneration Committee
and agreed with the Director. The performance related targets focus on three elements: Group performance, divisional performance and personal
performance. The Group performance and divisional performance elements are based on the achievement of budgeted earnings per share and budgeted
divisional profit. The personal performance element is entirely at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and is a qualitative element reflecting
individual performance against key personal objectives. For service after 1 January 2000 the performance related element of the Directors' remuneration
is not taken into account in computing pension benefits.
Benefits in kind are awarded as the Remuneration Committee considers appropriate and currently comprise company cars, fuel, medical insurance 
and telephone costs.
The non-executive Directors' fees are limited to  200,000 per annum in the aggregate by the Articles of Association and within this aggregate the
annual fee for each non-executive Director is determined by the Board, the non-executive Director in question taking no part in the deliberations. 
With effect from 1 January 2003 the fees for the non-executive Directors were increased as follows:

1 Introduction (continued)
Each of the non-executive Directors is appointed for a fixed term not exceeding three years. The appointments are renewable with the agreement of
both parties again for terms not exceeding three years. The maximum period of aggregate service for a non-executive Director is limited to nine years.
Each of the executive Directors has a service contract which is subject to twelve months' notice. With the exception of Mr. S.P. Lonsdale, all the
executive Directors have contracts dated 19 November 2001; Mr Lonsdale's contract is dated 5 September 1997. Each of the executive Directors' service
contracts contain an explicit provision for compensation payment on termination, except in the case of misconduct. Where a Director's service contract
is terminated by the Company, a severance payment will be made comprising the sum of:
(i) the Director's basic annual salary at the time of notice; and
(ii) the performance related element estimated to be payable to the Director in respect of the financial year in which notice is served; and
(iii) an amount representing the value of  benefits in kind' in the audited accounts of the Company for the financial year immediately preceding 
the date of termination.
Additionally, the Company will procure a further twelve months' service (or, where appropriate, a further twelve months' Company contribution) to the
relevant Director's pension arrangement.
In principle the Board will permit the executive Directors to accept appointments outside the Company. However before accepting such appointments
the Director(s) involved must receive the prior written approval of the Board. In considering such cases the Board will always satisfy itself, as far as is
possible, that such appointments will not detract from the executive Directors' expected contribution to the Company, nor that such appointment 
will create any conflict of interest. Any fees earned by an executive Director in such a capacity are assigned to the Company as in the case of 
Mr. R.J. Davies' two external appointments with Geest plc and T & S Stores plc ( T & S'), where the non-executive Directors' annual fees of  24,000 and 
 25,000 respectively are paid directly to the Company on a quarterly basis. Mr. Davies resigned from his directorship of T & S on 6 January 2003
following the acquisition of T & S by Tesco plc.
The remaining sections of the Directors' Remuneration Report have been audited.

The highest price achieved by the Arriva plc ordinary share in the year ended 31 December 2002 was 390p; the lowest price of the Arriva plc ordinary
share in the same period was 262.5p.
The executive Directors participate in one or more of the Group's share option schemes. The Executive Share Option Scheme and the Share Incentive
Scheme both incorporate performance target requirements which must be achieved before the exercise of the share option is permitted. The performance
targets are set by the Remuneration Committee and may be varied from time to time. The current target requires the Company's earnings per share
over a period of three consecutive years prior to any exercise to exceed the Retail Price Index by a minimum of 2 per cent p.a. i.e. 6% over the 
three year period. 
Following the introduction of The Long Term Incentive Plan, the Directors are no longer eligible to participate in future option grants under the Company's
executive share option schemes. Arriva plc

The market value of the ordinary shares on the dates of the conditional share awards was as follows:
2 May 2000: 190p
9 March 2001: 294.75p
30 October 2002: 305.25p
6 March 2003: 302p
The vesting of the shares will depend upon the performance of the Company's earnings per share when compared with the growth in the Retail Price
Index and also of the Total Shareholder Return ( TSR') of the Company when compared with the TSR of the Peer Comparator Group (comprising the
constituent companies of the FTSE 250, excluding investment companies) over a period of three years. The vesting will be on a sliding scale of 25 per
cent - 100 per cent and no share will vest unless the TSR of Arriva plc is at least equal to the median TSR of the Peer Comparator Group, and that
Arriva's earnings per share in the same period has exceeded the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 6 per cent. The Remuneration Committee
believes the FTSE 250 to be an appropriate and challenging target which closely aligns the interests of The LTIP participants with those of the shareholders.
With regard to the two performance conditions governing the award made on 2 May 2000, the earnings per share of the Company over the three year
period increased by 25.5 per cent and the Retail Price Index over the same period increased by 6.69 per cent. The Company's Total Shareholder Return
over the same period achieved upper quartile performance (37 per cent) when compared with the Peer Comparator Group.

Source: Datastream
As a consequence, the Remuneration Committee confirmed on 6 March 2003 the vesting of the whole of the conditional share awards made 
on 2 May 2000; the market price of the Arriva plc ordinary share on the date of vesting was 302p. It is an objective of the Remuneration Committee 
that the Directors will utilise awards under The LTIP to build up an interest in the share capital of the Company which is broadly equivalent to one year s
base annual salary from time to time.
The Remuneration Committee has considered the impact that the short-term volatility in pension costs, caused by changes in bond yields and equity
market fluctuations, has on the Group's reported financial performance and the consequent impact on the performance measures underlying the
Group's long-term management incentive schemes. Without amendment of the performance measures that are related to earnings per share growth,
the Committee believes that attainment of long-term performance targets might prove too easily achievable in some circumstances and almost
impossible in others. This is contrary to the fundamental objective of the Long Term Incentive Plan which is to motivate and reward management to
achieve objectives that support the pursuit of shareholder value. The Committee has therefore determined that the calculation of earnings per share
growth for all conditional awards, made after January 2003, will exclude the impact on the annual pension charge of gains or losses arising from
movements in the equity and bond markets. In making this assessment the Remuneration Committee received advice from Mercer Human Resource
Consulting Limited. The adjustment required will be subject to external audit.
5 Remuneration Report Approval
An ordinary resolution to consider, and if thought fit approve this Remuneration Report, will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
