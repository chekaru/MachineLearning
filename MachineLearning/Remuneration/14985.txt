 1 Introduction
All matters relating to the remuneration of the executive directors are determined by the Remuneration Committee. The Committee, which is chaired
by Mr. M.J. Allen, is appointed by the Board and comprises four members all of whom are independent non-executive directors; the quorum for the
valid transaction of business is three and no executive director has any right of attendance or membership. The principal objective of the Remuneration
Committee is to ensure that the executive directors are both highly motivated and fairly rewarded for their contribution to the Group's overall
performance having due regard to the interests of the shareholders, the overall remuneration structure within the Group and practices adopted by
comparator companies.
When considering the remuneration of the directors, the Committee benchmarks the value added to shareholders' interests by the company with that
of a comparator group comprising representative companies from the passenger transport and support services sectors.
The Committee is required to determine and agree with the Board, and keep under review, both the policy and the detailed elements of the
remuneration packages of the Chairman and the executive directors together with the broad policy relating to the remuneration arrangements for
senior managers. In formulating its policy the Committee will have due regard to the practices adopted by the comparator group.
The remit of the Committee requires it to regularly review targets and benefits under any performance related pay arrangements to ensure that they
remain consistent with the long term interests and expectations of the shareholders. Periodically the Committee will critically evaluate the merits and
effectiveness of performance related pay schemes as they affect the Board.
The Remuneration Committee considers all elements comprising executive remuneration, including basic salary, performance related bonus, share
option scheme grants, awards under the company's Long Term Incentive Plan, pension provision, benefits in kind and service agreement terms. From
1 January 2000 directors' bonus has not been taken into account in computing pension benefits.
In the case of the executive directors, the Remuneration Committee takes independent advice from specialist consultants in developing its remuneration
policy and ensuring that the overall reward package remains competitive. It is the policy of the Committee that the benchmark for executive directors'
salaries should be the median of equivalent roles in comparable companies in the transport and support services sectors. During 2003, Mercer Human
Resource Consulting Ltd reviewed all aspects of executive director remuneration and its recommendations were adopted and implemented by the
Remuneration Committee with effect from July 2003. With effect from January 2004, the base salaries of the executive directors were increased 
by 5%.
The executive directors participate in a performance related bonus arrangement with bonus being paid on the attainment of specified targets
established by the Remuneration Committee and agreed with the director. The Chief Executive is targeted on group performance with the other
executive directors being targeted on group, divisional and personal performances. The Group performance and divisional performance elements are
based on the achievement of budgeted earnings per share and budgeted divisional profit; the personal performance element is entirely at the discretion
of the Remuneration Committee and is a qualitative element reflecting individual performance against key personal objectives. The non-executive
directors do not participate in any performance related pay arrangements.
Benefits in kind are awarded as the Remuneration Committee considers appropriate and currently comprise company cars (or a cash allowance on
a basis that is cost neutral to the company), fuel, medical insurance and telephone costs.
The non-executive directors' fees are currently limited to  200,000 per annum in the aggregate by the Articles of Association and have been at that
level since 1997; however, in order to meet the future anticipated needs for further high calibre non-executive director representation on the Board, the
Notice of the Annual General Meeting contains a Special Resolution which, if approved, will increase this aggregate sum to  400,000 per annum and
will provide for this cap to be increased annually in line with the index of wage inflation. Within the aggregate cap the annual fee for each non-
executive director is determined by the Board, the non-executive directors taking no part in the deliberations. With effect from 1 January 2004 the fee
for each of the non-executive directors was increased by the payment of a supplement at the rate of  3,000 per annum in recognition of the increased
obligations arising from Corporate Governance requirements and additional responsibilities associated with chairing the Board's principal Committees.
Each of the non-executive directors is appointed for a fixed term not exceeding three years. The appointments are renewable with the agreement
of both parties again for terms not exceeding three years. The maximum period of aggregate service for a non-executive director is nine years.
Each of the executive directors has a rolling service contract which is subject to twelve months' notice. With the exception of Mr. S.P . Lonsdale, all the
executive directors have contracts dated 19 November 2001; Mr. S.P . Lonsdale's contract is dated 5 September 1997. Each of the executive directors'
service contracts contain an explicit provision for compensation payment on termination, except in the case of misconduct. Where a director's service
contract is terminated by the company, a severance payment will be made comprising the sum of:
(i) the director's basic annual salary at the time of notice; and
(ii) the performance related element estimated to be payable to the director in respect of the financial year in which notice is served; and

(iii) An amount representing the value of  benefits in kind' in the audited accounts of the company for the financial year immediately preceding the 
date of termination.
In principle the Board will permit the executive directors to accept appointments outside the company. However before accepting such appointments
the director(s) involved must receive the prior written approval of the Board. In considering such cases the Board will always satisfy itself, as far as
is possible, that such appointments will not detract from the executive directors' expected contribution to the company, nor that such appointment
will create any conflict of interest. Any fees earned by an executive director in such a capacity will be assigned to the company as in the case of
Mr. R.J. Davies' appointment as a non-executive director of Geest plc, where the non-executive director's annual fee of  25,000 is paid directly to the
company on a quarterly basis.

  Re-stated following an actuarial error in 2002
Subject to Inland Revenue limits, Mr. S.P . Lonsdale, Mr. S.J. Clayton and Mr. D.R. Martin are, with effect from 1 January 2000, accruing benefits in their
respective schemes at the rate of 1/30th of basic annual salary; prior to January 2000 their benefits accrued at the rate of 1/60th of pensionable salary.
The aggregate benefit accruing to Mr. E.A.R. Cameron and Mr. A.M. Saxton from the Arriva Pension Scheme and the FURBS is equivalent to 1/30th of
basic annual salary for each year of service. Mr. J.A. Ray commenced drawing his pension from the Arriva Pension Scheme upon his retirement from
the Board; the pension disclosed as at 31 December 2003 represents the pension in payment; Mr. E.A.R. Cameron has elected to draw his pension
from the Arriva Pension Scheme following his retirement on 31 December 2003. The reduction in the accrued pensions and their associated values for
Mr. E.A.R. Cameron and Mr. J.A. Ray, reflects the actuarial reduction applied on the crystallisation of their benefits. Arriva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 35

# The closing mid market price of the ordinary share on 31 December 2003 was 380p
The highest price achieved by the Arriva plc ordinary share in the year ended 31 December 2003 was 411p on 16 October 2003; the lowest price of the
Arriva plc ordinary share in the same period was 259.5p on 14 February 2003.
The executive directors have residual interests in one or more of the Group's share option schemes. The Executive Share Option Scheme and the Share
Incentive Scheme both incorporate performance target requirements which must be achieved before the exercise of the share option is permitted. The
performance targets are set by the Remuneration Committee and may be varied from time to time. The current target requires the company's earnings
per share over a period of three consecutive years prior to any exercise to exceed the Retail Prices Index by a minimum of 2 per cent p.a. i.e. 6 per cent
over the three year period.
Following the introduction of The Long Term Incentive Plan in 2000, the executive directors are no longer eligible to participate in option grants under
the company's executive share option schemes. 36 Arriva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003

Mr. J.A. Ray retired from the Board on 4 July 2003 and the conditional share awards made to him on 9 March 2001 (62,355 ordinary shares) and 
6 March 2003 (61,837 ordinary shares) lapsed. Mr. E.A.R. Cameron retired from the Board on 31 December 2003 and the conditional share awards
made to him on 30 October 2002 (58,187 ordinary shares) and 6 March 2003 (63,693 ordinary shares) lapsed.
The performance measurement periods in respect of the conditional share awards comprising the interests of the directors under The LTIP at the year
end, and the market value of the ordinary share on the dates of the awards are as follows:
Award date Performance measurement period Market value at date of award
9 March 2001 Three years ending 31 December 2003 294.75p
30 October 2002 Three years ending 31 December 2004 305.25p
6 March 2003 Three years ending 31 December 2005 302.00p
The vesting of the shares will depend upon the performance of the company's earnings per share when compared with the growth in the Retail Prices
Index and also of the Total Shareholder Return ( TSR') of the company when compared with the TSR of the Peer Comparator Group (comprising the
constituent companies of the FTSE 250, excluding investment companies) over a period of three years. The vesting will be on a sliding scale of 25 per
cent - 100 per cent and no share will vest unless the TSR of Arriva plc is at least equal to the median TSR of the Peer Comparator Group, and that
Arriva's earnings per share in the same period has exceeded the growth in the Retail Prices Index by at least 6 per cent.
With regard to the conditional award made on 9 March 2001 the growth in the company's earnings per share over the three years ended
31 December 2003 increased by 20 per cent compared with the growth in the Retail Prices Index over the same period of 6.6 per cent. Over the
same period the company's Total Shareholder Return was 62.8 per cent, exceeding the threshold for the upper quartile of the Peer Comparator Group
by 7.8 percentage points.
As both performance conditions were met, and as the TSR achieved upper quartile performance when compared with the TSR of the Peer Comparator
Group, the Remuneration Committee confirmed on 3 March 2004 that shares comprising the conditional award made on 9 March 2001 and still
subsisting at 31 December 2003 should vest in full.
The market price of the Arriva plc ordinary share on the date of vesting was as follows:
