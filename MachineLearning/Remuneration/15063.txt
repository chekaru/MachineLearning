 54 | Driving on Arriva plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
1. Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and has been
approved by both the Remuneration Committee and the Board.
The committee is responsible for all matters relating to the remuneration arrangements for executive directors, and selected senior
management below Board level. 
Membership of the committee is limited to the non-executive directors. The membership in 2008 was as follows:
N P Buckles (chairman)
Sir Richard Broadbent       
S G Batey
As announced on 11 December 2008, Angie Risley will be joining the Board as a non-executive director on 9 March 2009. 
Subject to her election as a director at the Annual General Meeting she will also become a member of the Remuneration Committee
on 22 April 2009. The membership will thereafter comprise three independent non-executive directors and the chairman of the Board.
During the year, the committee met on five occasions; details of the attendance at meetings appear in the corporate governance
report on page 65.
2. Remuneration policy
The objective of the Board's remuneration policy is to recruit and retain high quality directors and managers by providing competitive
rewards based on the achievement of targets which are aligned to the company's strategic goals and with returns to shareholders.
In reaching its decisions, the committee has regard to levels and structures of remuneration among a peer pay comparator group
which it has established and continues to maintain with independent advice comprising a selection of FTSE 250 companies (from
the transport and other sectors) of a similar size and complexity to that of the company. The committee also has regard to
remuneration levels and structures among a smaller group of companies representing its direct competitors in the transport sector
and, on the basis of survey data, of a broad range of industrial companies.  
Performance targets selected by the committee are subject to periodic review to ensure continued congruence with the group's
strategic goals.  
3. Remuneration review
During 2008, the committee conducted a full review of the remuneration arrangements introduced after the last such review in 2005.
The committee appointed T owers Perrin as independent advisers to assist in the review.
The review concluded that the remuneration arrangements introduced in 2006 were working broadly as intended with regard to
structure and opportunity.  In particular, the committee decided to recommend no change to the performance targets of the LTIP
which remain top quartile TSR and annual growth in EPS of RPI plus 4 - 13 per cent over three years. Regarding the annual bonus
structure, the committee decided that no change was necessary in the quantum of opportunity (100 per cent of salary of which 
30 per cent relates to personal objectives and 70 per cent to a defined financial target) but that in respect of 2009 the financial
target would be specified 50 per cent in relation to EBIT and 20 per cent in relation to EPS. 
Independent analysis of published data during the review revealed that a material gap has opened up between executive directors'
salaries at Arriva and at companies in its peer groups whether narrowly or broadly defined. This gap is currently in the range 
10 - 15 per cent, reflecting the restraint shown in recent years during which executive salaries have increased by 3 - 4 per cent per
annum. On the basis of the extensive analysis conducted, the committee concluded that fair and competitive salaries for the
individuals concerned would be, respectively,  535,000 for David Martin (an increase of 11.4 per cent),  360,000 for Steve Lonsdale 
(an increase of 15.4 per cent) and  305,000 for Steve Clayton (an increase of 8.9 per cent).
Directors' remuneration report 55
The Remuneration Committee has considered very carefully what to do in this situation. It is aware that the external environment,
and the reputation of the company, must be fully taken into account in its decisions. It is also aware of its responsibilities to the
individuals concerned, and to the interests of the company in ensuring that management at the most senior level are properly
motivated and their services retained for the benefit of the company. It has discussed the situation with the executive directors
themselves and it has conducted extensive consultations with major shareholders. 
The committee is clear that it is not in the interests of the company to continue indefinitely paying salaries to its senior executives
that are well below the median of its competitors and its peer group. It intends therefore as a matter of policy to seek to close the
gap that has developed as quickly as possible. The committee also recognises that in doing so it must take full account of the
external environment it is operating in. In reaching its decisions, it has also paid careful regard to the views expressed by
shareholders and shareholder representative bodies that it has consulted. In all the circumstances, the committee has concluded
that basic salaries will be increased as follows: 
Salary at 1 January 2009 
Increase  000 pa
D R Martin 3% 494
S J Clayton 3% 288
S P Lonsdale 5% 328
These increases are materially less than those required to deal with the shortfall in executive salaries described above and the
committee will continue to give close attention to executive salaries in the coming years.
4. Remuneration structure
(a) Base salary
Each of the executive directors is paid a basic annual salary which is reviewed in January each year. The salaries of the executive
directors were increased effective from 1 January 2009, as detailed in section 3 above.
(b) Performance related bonus
Each of the executive directors has the opportunity to earn an annual bonus of up to 100 per cent of basic annual salary of which 
70 per cent of the potential award is determined by group financial performance, with the balance being determined by the
performance of each director against qualitative objectives agreed at the beginning of the year.
With regard to the group financial performance element, the target is group earnings per share before goodwill impairment and
intangible asset amortisation calculated in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and adjusted for exceptional
items. The committee reviews annually the EPS target to ensure that it remains appropriate in the context of the group's strategy and
the delivery of sustained shareholder value.  For 2008 the EPS element of the bonus arrangement was structured as follows:
Bonus as a 
EPS target (p) per cent of basic salary
Less than 55.9 Nil
59.7 25
61.4 50
64.4 70 56 | Driving on Arriva plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
The qualitative element of directors' bonus arrangements focuses on delivery of specific elements of strategy, environmental issues,
organisational and management goals and the development of a high calibre management team. The Remuneration Committee will
consider also the opportunities for incorporating social and governance targets within future performance related pay structures.
As a consequence of the EPS performance of the group for the year ended 31 December 2008 of 61.5 pence and the performance
of each director against the qualitative targets agreed at the beginning of the year, bonus payments were made to each executive
director in March 2009 as follows:
Bonus for year ended 31 December
2008 2007
  
D R Martin 375,360 425,000
S J Clayton 209,200 243,900
S P Lonsdale 239,300 265,700
823,860 934,600
The non-executive directors do not participate in the performance related bonus scheme and no change to this policy is envisaged.
(c) Long Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP')
The LTIP is a share-based plan and comprises a conditional award of shares of a value equivalent to 200 per cent of the executive
director's basic salary as at the date of an award; awards are normally made each March following the announcement of the
group's preliminary results for the preceding financial year.
Since 2006, awards have comprised a blend of two elements with each element providing the opportunity for each executive
director to earn up to one half of the conditional share award. Each element operates as follows:
(i) Total Shareholder Return element ( TSR')
This element provides the opportunity to earn up to one half of the initial conditional award and is based on the group's TSR
performance when ranked against the TSR performance of those companies comprising a  peer comparator group'. For this
purpose the peer comparator group consists of companies (excluding the company and investment companies) whose shares
comprise the FTSE 250 at the beginning of each three-year measurement period.
Performance is measured over three consecutive financial years (1 January - 31 December), the first year of the measurement
period being the year in which the conditional share award is made. In order for shares to vest under this element, the TSR
performance of the group must achieve, as a minimum, the median TSR performance of the peer comparator group;
achievement of the median position will generate the vesting of 25 per cent of this element of the award, and this will increase
on a linear basis to 100 per cent (of this element) on the achievement of upper quartile performance.
The TSR performance is independently calculated and verified by Alithos Limited.
(ii) The EPS element
This element also provides the opportunity to earn up to one half of the initial conditional award; vesting of the shares is on a
linear scale with 10 per cent vesting if EPS increases to a level which is four per cent per annum in excess of the increase in
the Retail Prices Index over the three-year measurement period; vesting will increase on a linear scale to a maximum of 
100 per cent (of this element) on EPS performance achieving or exceeding 13 per cent per annum in excess of the growth 
in the Retail Prices Index.
The company operates share retention guidelines which require each executive director to retain 50 per cent of any vested
shares until such time as a holding equivalent in value to basic annual salary has been achieved.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the LTIP , and no change to this policy is envisaged.
Directors' remuneration report continued 57
The vesting of the shares conditionally awarded in 2006 had as the performance measurement period the three years ended 31 December
2008. The TSR over the period was in the upper quartile and therefore 100 per cent of this element of the award vests. The EPS
performance target required to achieve 100 per cent vesting of this element of the award was 70.4 pence. The actual EPS performance
was 61.5 pence and, as a consequence 49 per cent of this element of the award vests. The Remuneration Committee confirmed the
vesting position on 4 March 2009.
Changes in the interests of the executive directors in conditional share awards made under the LTIP in the year ended 31 December 2008

the aggregate; this level was established following approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 23 April
2004, and the Articles permit the directors to increase this cap annually in line with the increase in the index of UK wage inflation.

3 Arriva London North & Arriva London South Pension Scheme
Notes:
1. Notwithstanding an increase in Mr Martin's accrued pension at 31 December 2008, the transfer value fell in comparison with
the previous year reflecting changes in market conditions and changes to the calculation of the transfer value consequent
upon the adoption of revised assumptions for the 2008 valuation of the Arriva Passenger Services Pension Plan.
2. The transfer values for Messrs Clayton and Lonsdale have increased as a result of an increase in their accrued pensions,
changes in market conditions and the impact of the trustees of their respective schemes having adopted increased
allowances for future mortality improvements for all scheme members.
Messrs Martin, Clayton and Lonsdale are now accruing pension at 1/30th of base pay for all years of service. For service pre 2000
pension had been calculated at 1/60th per annum of base pay and a restricted element of bonus; in accordance with best practice
guidelines, bonus is now removed from the calculation which now computes pension at 1/30th per annum of base salary for all
service. This change does not alter the actuarial value of the benefit.
No future executive director external appointees to the Board will be eligible for a final salary based pension arrangement, 
but instead will receive a cash contribution equal to 25 per cent of basic salary.  
Mr Martin has the opportunity to elect to take an annual cash sum, paid monthly in arrears (on a basis that is cost neutral to the
company), in lieu of any future pension accrual.
(h) Service contracts
Each of the three executive directors has a service contract dated 19 April 2006; the contracts are subject to 12 months' notice
from the company and six months' notice from the director. Each contract contains covenants restricting the ability of the director,
within a period of six months from termination, from competing with the company. The contracts make specific provision with
regard to termination payments which are quantified as the sum of:
(i) The director's basic pay at the date of termination;
(ii) The amount of bonus estimated to be payable in respect of the year in which notice is served, but in any event capped at
maximum of 40 per cent of basic pay; and
(iii) The value of the benefits in kind.
Additionally, in the case of termination by the company, the company will seek to procure that the director is credited with an
additional 12 months' service in his respective pension scheme.

Directors' remuneration report continued 61
Should the director terminate the contract within six months of a change of control of the company he will receive a termination
payment equal to 50 per cent of the termination payment described above.
(i) External Board appointments 
The Board will permit executive directors to accept one appointment outside the company.  Before accepting such appointments
the director(s) involved must receive the prior approval of the Board. In considering such cases the Board will always satisfy itself,
as far as is possible, that such appointments will not detract from the executive directors' expected contribution to the company,
nor that such appointment will create any conflict of interest; any fees earned by an executive director in such a capacity will be
assigned to the company.
(j) TSR graph
In accordance with the provisions of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985, detailed below is a graph charting the performance
of the company's Total Shareholder Return (share value growth plus re-invested dividends over the past five years) compared with
