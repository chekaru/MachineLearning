Report on Directors' Remuneration 
 
As an AIM listed company we are not required to comply with the listing rules related to the reporting of 
Directors' remuneration. Nevertheless, as part of the Company's commitment to best practice, a strenuous 
effort has been made to adhere to these provisions. 
 
Policy on Executive Directors' Remuneration 
The Remuneration Committee comprises Michel Lendvai, John Yianni and Berthold Hackl (following his 
appointment to the Board 22 March 2007, as detailed in note 28). The Remuneration Committee is 
responsible for reviewing and determining the Group's policy on executive remuneration (including the 
grant of options under the Share Option Scheme) and ensuring compliance with and implementation by the 
Group, as far as reasonably practicable, of the recommendations and guidelines of the Combined Code. 
Executive remuneration packages are designed to ensure the Group's executive directors and senior 
executives are fairly rewarded for their individual contributions to the Group. 
 
Fees for Non Executive Directors 
The fees for non executive directors are determined by the Board.

Statement of Directors' Responsibilities in Respect of the Annual Report and 
Accounts 
 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations. 
 
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each 
financial year. As required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange we are required to prepare the 
Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable laws and have 
elected to prepare the parent company statements on the same basis. 
 
The group and parent company financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU to 
present fairly the financial position of the group and the parent company and the performance for that 
period; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial statements that references in the 
relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving 
a fair presentation. 
 
In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to: 
 
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
  make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
  state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and 
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that 
the Group and the parent company will continue in business. 
  
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have a general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities. 
 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
