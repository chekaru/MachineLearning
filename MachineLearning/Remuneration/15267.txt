The Company believes that share ownership by Executive Directors and senior executives strengthens the links between
their personal interest and those of investors.
At 31 March 2004 options were outstanding to Directors under the terms of the share option schemes to subscribe for
ordinary shares as follows:
At 31 March 2003 Date from

CHRISTOPHER MUSSELLE 1,500,000 16p 17/5/2003 18/5/2010
No options were granted, exercised or lapsed during the year.
The closing mid-market price of the company's shares on 31 March 2004 was 2.38p per share and the high and low prices
during the year were 4.25p and 1.25p respectively.
Options granted since the year end
Immediately prior to the grant of new options on 1 April 2004, Christopher Musselle surrendered 280,000 existing share
options in the Approved Executive Share Option scheme. 200,000 existing share options in the Approved Executive Share
Option scheme were also surrendered by a subsidiary company director.
Under the authority allowed in the existing Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Option schemes, share options
have been issued to the Executive Directors of Artisan (UK) plc and other senior management of the trading companies
within the Group. The number and terms of the share options were carefully considered by the Remuneration Committee
and issued to help ensure that the interests of senior management of the Group are maintained alongside those of the
shareholders. The Remuneration Committee believe that a principal interest of the shareholders is share price growth and
accordingly the exercise of the shares is conditional upon share price growth in Artisan (UK) plc.
