The Remuneration Committee consists of Norman Saunders and

during the year and at least twice a year.
Remuneration Committee responsibilities
The Remuneration Committee provides advice and recommendations
to the Board regarding the Company's framework for executive
remuneration and its duties include:
  monitoring the remuneration policies applied in the Group 
having regard to relevant market comparisons and practice;
  considering and making recommendations on the remuneration

contracts and compensation payments) of executive directors of
the Company. Its approach is consistent with the Group's overall
philosophy that all staff should be competitively rewarded;
  considering and making recommendations on the remuneration
arrangements (including bonuses, pension rights, service
contracts and compensation payments) of senior executives 
of the Group;
  ensuring that the remuneration policy and the Group's practices 
for executive directors facilitate the employment and motivation 
of top quality personnel and adequately reward individual
contributions made to the Group while at the same time remaining

appropriate;
  monitoring the Group's employee share schemes in relation 
to legislative and market developments and determining within 
the overall remuneration policy the level of options or awards
under such schemes, and making recommendations for the 
grant of options.
Policy
The Company has given full consideration to the principles of, and
has complied as far as possible with the provisions of, the Combined
Code on directors' remuneration.
A strategic aim is to align as closely as possible the interests of
employees and shareholders. This is achieved by attracting, training,
developing and retaining talented staff at all levels throughout the
Group underpinned by the provision of highly competitive salaries
and benefits to all employees.
Individual salary, bonus and benefit levels for executive directors 
and other senior executives are reviewed annually by the
Remuneration Committee and are determined by reference to 
a range of criteria including:
  personal performance;
  level of responsibility;
  the performance of the Group relative to its competitors; and
  the practice of other listed companies, in particular those operating
in similar sectors.
Remuneration packages
The remuneration package for executive directors comprises short
term and longer term benefits, post retirement benefits and share
options. The Remuneration Committee is empowered to take external
advice to help ensure the appropriateness of these benefits, where it
considers it appropriate to do so.
Short term benefits comprise annual salary, provision of a company
car (or car allowance), life assurance, medical expenses insurance
and performance bonuses.
Directors' service agreements
Each of the executive directors has a service agreement which
requires not more than twelve months notice of termination. 
The non-executive directors have contracts with the Company
terminable at six months notice.
Pensions
Pension contributions are paid on a money purchase basis to 
the personal pension schemes of the executive directors. These
arrangements are continually reviewed to ensure that they are
appropriate. There is no intention to set up an occupational 
pension scheme.
Non-executive directors
The fees of non-executive directors are set by the Board.

Report on directors' remuneration continued
Immediately prior to the grant of new options on 1 April 2004,
Christopher Musselle surrendered 280,000 existing share options in
the Approved Executive Share Option scheme. 200,000 existing
share options in the Approved Executive Share Option scheme were
also surrendered by a subsidiary company director.
Under the authority allowed in the existing Approved and
Unapproved Executive Share Option schemes, share options have
been issued to the executive directors of Artisan (UK) plc and other
senior management of the trading companies within the Group. 
The number and terms of the share options were carefully considered
by the Remuneration Committee and issued to help ensure that 
the interests of senior management of the Group are maintained
alongside those of the shareholders. The Remuneration Committee
believe that a principal interest of the shareholders is share price
growth and accordingly the exercise of the shares is conditional 
upon share price growth in Artisan (UK) plc.

price of an ordinary share exceeding the threshold price for a
consecutive period of 30 days prior to the date of exercise.
The threshold price is:
  until 6 April 2007 4.25p
  until 31 March 2008 4.75p
  until 31 March 2009 5.50p
  after 31 March 2009 the option lapses
These options may be exercised between three and ten years after
the options were granted.
b) The exercise of the option is conditional on the closing mid-market
price of an ordinary share exceeding 4.25p ( the threshold price')
for a consecutive period of 90 days prior to the third anniversary of
the date of grant. These options may be exercised between three
and six years after the options were granted.
c) The exercise of the option is conditional on the closing mid-market
price of an ordinary share exceeding 4.75p ( the threshold price')
for a consecutive period of 90 days prior to the third anniversary of
the date of grant. These options may be exercised between three
and six years after the options were granted.
Options recommended since the year end
On 5 July 2005, the Remuneration Committee recommended 
the grant of 4,666,666 further unapproved share options to 
the executive directors of Artisan (UK) plc and other senior
management. These options will be granted on 18 July 2005, 
their exercise price being fixed by reference to the average closing
share price of the Company in the previous week.
Options to be granted to directors in this regard are as follows:
