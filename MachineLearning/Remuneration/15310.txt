Report on directors' remuneration continued
Under the authority allowed in the existing Approved and
Unapproved Executive Share Option schemes, share options have
been issued to the Executive Directors of Artisan (UK) plc and other
senior management of the trading companies within the Group. The
number and terms of the share options were carefully considered by
the Remuneration Committee and issued to help ensure that the
interests of senior management of the Group are maintained
alongside those of the shareholders. The Remuneration Committee
believe that a principal interest of the shareholders is share price
growth and accordingly the exercise of the shares is conditional upon
share price growth in Artisan (UK) plc.
