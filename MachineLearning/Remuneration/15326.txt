Report on directors' remuneration continued REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 ARTISAN (UK) plc 17
The number of share options in existence at 31 March 2006, the
options granted in the period and the exercise prices have been
restated to reflect the capital re-organisation during the year (see note
20).
No options were exercised during the period (2006 - None).
Under the authority allowed in the existing Approved and
Unapproved Executive Share Option schemes, share options have
been issued to the Executive Directors of Artisan (UK) plc and other
senior management of the trading companies within the Group. The
number and terms of the share options were carefully considered by
the Remuneration Committee and issued to help ensure that the
interests of senior management of the Group are maintained
alongside those of the shareholders. The Remuneration Committee
believe that a principal interest of the shareholders is share price
growth and accordingly the exercise of the shares is conditional upon
share price growth in Artisan (UK) plc.
Conditions
a) The exercise of the option is conditional on the closing mid-market
price of an ordinary share exceeding the threshold price for a
consecutive period of 30 days prior to the date of exercise.
The threshold price is:
  until 6 April 2007 170p
  until 31 March 2008 190p
  until 31 March 2009 220p
  after 31 March 2009 the option lapses
These options may be exercised between three and ten years after
the options were granted.
b) The exercise of the option is conditional on the closing mid-market
price of an ordinary share exceeding 170p ( the threshold price')
for a consecutive period of 90 days prior to the third anniversary of
the date of grant. These options may be exercised between three
and six years after the options were granted.
c) The exercise of the option is conditional on the closing mid-market
price of an ordinary share exceeding 190p ( the threshold price')
for a consecutive period of 90 days prior to the third anniversary of
the date of grant. These options may be exercised between three
and six years after the options were granted.
d) The exercise of the option is conditional on the closing mid-market
price of an ordinary share exceeding 220p ( the threshold price')
for a consecutive period of 90 days prior to the third anniversary of
the date of grant. These options may be exercised between three
and six years after the options were granted.
e) The exercise of the option is conditional on the closing mid-market
price of an ordinary share exceeding 260p ( the threshold price')
for a consecutive period of 90 days prior to third anniversary of the
date of grant. These options may be exercised between three and
six years after the options were granted.
In respect of the unapproved options exerciseable between 1 April
2007 and 1 April 2010, if the conditions are not satisfied by the
third anniversary of the date of grant, then the options will
nonetheless be exerciseable if the conditions of any options
subsequently issued under the Unapproved scheme are fulfilled.
