Report on directors' remuneration continued
No options were granted or exercised during the year (2008: None).
Under the authority allowed in the existing Unapproved Executive
Share Option scheme, share options have been issued to certain of
the Executive Directors of Artisan (UK) plc. The number and terms of
the share options were carefully considered by the Remuneration
Committee and issued to help ensure that the interests of senior
management of the Group are maintained alongside those of the
shareholders. The Remuneration Committee believe that a principal
interest of the shareholders is share price growth and accordingly the
exercise of the shares is conditional upon share price growth in
Artisan (UK) plc.
Conditions
a) The exercise of the option is conditional on the closing mid-market
price of an ordinary share exceeding 170p ( the threshold price')
for a consecutive period of 90 days prior to the third anniversary of
the date of grant. These options may be exercised between three
and six years after the options were granted.
b) The exercise of the option is conditional on the closing mid-market
price of an ordinary share exceeding 190p ( the threshold price')
for a consecutive period of 90 days prior to the third anniversary of
the date of grant. These options may be exercised between three
and six years after the options were granted.
c) The exercise of the option is conditional on the closing mid-market
price of an ordinary share exceeding 220p ( the threshold price')
for a consecutive period of 90 days prior to the third anniversary of
the date of grant. These options may be exercised between three
and six years after the options were granted.
d) The exercise of the option is conditional on the closing mid-market
price of an ordinary share exceeding 260p ( the threshold price')
for a consecutive period of 90 days prior to third anniversary of the
date of grant. These options may be exercised between three and
six years after the options were granted.
If the conditions of the unapproved options are not satisfied by the
third anniversary of the date of grant, then the options will
nonetheless be exercisable if the conditions of any options
subsequently issued under the Unapproved scheme are fulfilled.
Directors' interests
The Directors' interests in the ordinary shares of the Company are set
out in the Directors' Report on page 12 and details of the options
outstanding are set out above.
