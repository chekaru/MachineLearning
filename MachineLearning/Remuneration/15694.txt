Remuneration policy for the executive directors
The Group's policy on executive directors' remuneration is to:
   attract and retain high quality executives by paying competitive remuneration packages relevant to each director's role, experience and 
the external market. The packages include contributions to private medical insurance; and
   give incentive to directors to maximise shareholder value through a long term reward approach, mainly through the award of shares, 
which are not exercisable immediately, against key performance indicators.
The remuneration committee's revised policy, developed with PwC support, has been circulated to and discussed with major shareholders.
Service agreements
No director has a service agreement with a notice period that exceeds six months.
