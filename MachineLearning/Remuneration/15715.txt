r emuneration Committee report
Remuneration Committee statement
The Group's policy on Executive directors' remuneration is to:
>  
attract and retain high quality executives by paying competitive remuneration packages relevant to each director's role, 
experience and the external market. The packages include contributions to private medical insurance; and
>  
give incentive to directors to maximise shareholder value through a long-term reward approach, mainly through the award 
of shares, which are not exercisable immediately, against key performance indicators.
The revised pay structure for directors and senior staff (including a long-term incentive plan), agreed by the Board and endorsed 
by major shareholders in 2009-2010, has not been progressed. Market conditions have rendered the targets unachievable and the 
r emuneration Committee believes it was inappropriate to amend directors' packages in this uncertain and constantly 
changing environment.
The r emuneration Committee has therefore only needed to meet on one occasion during the year to confirm its position on 
director pay and conditions including a freeze on staff salaries (apart from usual realignments on restructuring) and to agree 
a performance related approach for staff below Board level for the year ahead.
Shareholders will note the Chief Executive's pay appears to show a significant increase. This increase relates solely to his exercise 
of options in AH Medical Properties plc, the taxable benefit of which passed through Ashley House plc's PAYE system.
The Committee will reconsider remuneration for Executive directors in line with the Board's approval of the business plan for 
2011-2016 over the coming months.

No director has a service agreement with a notice period that exceeds three months.
