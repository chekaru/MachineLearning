Remuneration Committee statement
The Group's policy on Executive directors' remuneration is to:
   attract and retain high quality executives by paying competitive remuneration packages relevant to each director's role, experience 
and the external market. The packages include contributions to private medical insurance; and
   give incentive to directors to maximise shareholder value through a long-term reward approach, mainly through the award of shares, 
which are not exercisable immediately, against key performance indicators.
The Remuneration Committee has only needed to meet on one occasion during the year to confirm its position on director pay and 
conditions including a freeze on staff salaries (apart from usual realignments on restructuring) and to agree a performance related 
approach for staff below Board level for the year ahead.
The Committee will reconsider remuneration for Executive directors in line with the Board's approval of the business plan for 2013-2016 
over the coming months.
Service agreements
No director has a service agreement with a notice period that exceeds three months.
