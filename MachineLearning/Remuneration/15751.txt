 Statement of Directors' Responsibilities
Annual Report & Accounts 2003
The directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss for the
financial year.
In preparing the financial statements the Directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently, supported by judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent
  state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements
  prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless this is inappropriate 
The directors are also responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The directors also have responsibility for taking reasonable steps to safeguard the assets of the Group and prevent and detect fraud
and other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the Ashtead Group plc website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the
auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that
may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in
other jurisdictions.
By order of the Board
Robert Clark
Company Secretary
15 July 2003 Independent Auditors' Report to the Members of Ashtead Group plc
ASHTEAD GROUP PLC   .41.
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the profit and loss account, the balance sheet, the cash flow statement,
the statement of total recognised gains and losses and the related notes. We have also audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of
Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 contained in the directors' remuneration report (the auditable part ).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors' responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the directors' remuneration report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in the statement of directors' responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors' remuneration report in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.  This
report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company's members as a body in accordance with Section 235
of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose.  We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed
by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements
and the auditable part of the directors' remuneration report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors' report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors' remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors'
Report, the unaudited part of the Directors' Remuneration Report, the Chairman's Report, the Chief Executive's Review, the Financial
Review, the Operational Reviews and the Corporate Governance Report. 
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Company's compliance with the seven provisions of the
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are
not required to consider whether the board's statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company's Group's corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the auditable part
of the directors' remuneration report. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company's
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors'
remuneration report are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 30 April 2003 and of its 
loss and cash flows of the Group for the year then ended;
  the financial statements have  been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
  those parts of the directors' remuneration report required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
