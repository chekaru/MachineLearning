 Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. The report also meets
the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied 
the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors'
remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to
approve the report will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual
General Meeting of the Company.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company's
members on the  auditable part' of the Directors' Remuneration
Report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985 (as amended by the Regulations). The report has therefore
been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited
information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee ( the
Committee') in accordance with the recommendations of the
Combined Code. The members of the Committee are Mr Cole
(member throughout the year and chairman from 22 September
2003) and Mr Etheridge (appointed 12 January 2004). In addition,
the Committee was served by Mr Wheatley as chairman until his
retirement on 22 September 2003, Mr Staunton as a member until
his retirement on 20 February 2004 and Mr Lovegrove until the end
of the year, which covered the period during which the Committee
considered the directors' remuneration for 2004. None of the
Committee members has any personal financial interests, other 
than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
The Group's Chief Executive, Mr Burnett, normally attends the
meetings of the Committee to advise on operational aspects of 
the implementation of existing policies and policy proposals, except
where his own remuneration is concerned, as does the non-
executive chairman, Mr Stenham. The company secretary acts 
as secretary to the Committee. In formulating its policies, the
Committee has access to professional advice from outside the
Company, if required, and to publicly available reports and statistics. 
Remuneration policy for executive directors
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate
and retain directors of the high calibre needed to achieve the
Group's objectives and to reward them for enhancing value to
shareholders. The main elements of the remuneration package 
for executive directors and senior management are:
  basic annual salary and benefits in kind; 
  annual performance bonus plan;
  share related incentives, including the Investment Incentive Plan 
(a long-term co-investment plan) approved by shareholders on 
8 October 2001; and
  pension arrangements.
In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, the Company compares
packages offered by similar companies, which are chosen having
regard to:
  the size of the company (turnover, profits and number of 
people employed); 
  the diversity and complexity of its businesses; 
  the geographical spread of its businesses; and 
  their growth, expansion and change profile.
In making the comparisons, the Company takes into consideration
the scope of the Group's business, particularly its significant
operations in the US where the Company has a number of active,
publicly quoted, competitors. 
The Committee implements its remuneration policies by the design
of reward packages for executive directors comprising the
appropriate mix of salary, performance related cash incentive
bonuses and share options. Mr Burnett, with the approval of the
Board, holds two non-executive appointments outside the Group
and is allowed to retain the fees arising therefrom. None of the
other executive directors holds any outside appointments. In the
past year the Company has not obtained advice in regard to
executive directors' salary and incentive rewards from any third 
party adviser.
Basic salary
An executive director's basic salary is normally determined by the
Committee before the start of the year and when an individual
changes position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, 
the Committee considers the Group as a whole and seeks to be
competitive, but fair, using information provided both by internal
and external sources. During the year, due to the weak financial
performance of the Group in the year ended 30 April 2003 and 
the consequent reduction in its market capitalisation, the level of
the executive directors' basic salary was reviewed and, in the case 
of Mr Burnett and Mr Robson, adjusted downwards.
Annual performance related bonus plans
Under the annual performance related bonus plans for UK based
executive directors, payments are related directly to performance,
subject to a cap at two-thirds of an executive director's salary. The
discretionary annual bonus plan for Mr Burnett and Mr Robson
depended partly on financial performance and partly on non-
financial targets relating to our refinancing. Mr Dhaiwal's
discretionary bonus plan depended mainly on the financial
performance of A-Plant. 
In the year ended 30 April 2004, Mr Burnett and Mr Robson did
not achieve their performance targets relating to the Company's
financial performance. However, they were awarded discretionary
bonuses to recognise the efforts which they had made to deliver
the successful refinancing of the Group's debt facilities with the
completion of the issue of the senior secured notes in April 2004.
Accordingly, Mr Burnett earned 21% of his maximum potential
bonus and Mr Robson earned 42% of his maximum potential
bonus. In addition, Mr Dhaiwal was awarded a discretionary bonus
in respect of delivering our lenders' requirements of A-Plant,
representing 15% of his maximum potential bonus.

Directors' remuneration report Share related incentives
Details of the Company's existing arrangements are set out below.
The Committee is currently reviewing future share based incentive
arrangements with external advice.
Share option schemes
In relation to share option awards, the Committee's policy is to
make regular awards to senior staff in order that their personal
interests are aligned with those of shareholders. The value of the
shares underlying the options awarded is assessed by reference to 
a number of factors including the employee's salary, seniority and
length of service as well as both the Company's and the individual's
performance in the year prior to the award. 
It is the Company's practice to normally award share options
annually taking into account the results of the Group and/or the
operating division in the financial year ending on the 30 April
immediately before the date of grant and individual performance
and contribution in determining the amount of individual awards.
However, in light of the Company's financial performance in the
year ended 30 April 2003 no option awards were made in the year
to 30 April 2004.
Investment Incentive Plan
The Investment Incentive Plan is a long-term incentive plan which
provides for participants, who so elect, to invest all or a portion of
their annual cash bonuses in shares of the Company and, thus,
become eligible for matching awards in the form of shares which
only vest subject to demanding performance conditions. 
The matching awards are made in respect of investment shares
acquired by the director with all or part of their bonus for the
previous financial year. The matching awards only vest, in whole or
part, based on the annual growth in the Company's earnings per
share ( EPS') in the three year period following the award over that
of the year ended 30 April immediately prior to the date of the
award and on the Company's Total Shareholder Return ( TSR')
performance relative to a comparator group. In respect of the
matching awards granted, the relevant performance period is the
three year period from 8 October 2001 (when the Company's share
price at close was 72p) to 8 October 2004 for the awards granted
in 2001/2 and over the three year period from 29 July 2002 (when
the share price was 49.5p) to 28 July 2005 for the award granted in
2002/3. The comparator group comprises all of the FTSE 250 mid-
cap stocks other than investment trusts.
The above performance conditions have been chosen because they
are felt to align most closely the interests of senior management
with the interests of shareholders, by rewarding management for
achieving superior relative total shareholder return performance
compared with the FTSE 250 as a whole, excluding investment
trusts. The FTSE 250 is considered to be the Stock Exchange index
most appropriate to the size and scale of the Company's operations.
Vesting of the matching awards is based on the following required
performance grid:
Vesting operates on a scaled basis for performance between the
target levels shown in the grid above. Performance is measured 
at the end of the three year performance period when the awards
either vest in full or part or lapse completely. For performance
measurement purposes earnings per share is based on the profit
before exceptional items measured under consistently applied
accounting policies. Although the 2001/2 awards will not finally
lapse until after 8 October 2004, the Company's financial
performance to 30 April 2004 was below the minimum EPS growth
target and accordingly no matching awards will be made in respect
of that year's awards. In connection with the operation of the plan,
the Company established an Employee Share Ownership Trust
which holds 2,723,461 shares. Ownership of 2,072,582 
of these shares has been conditionally transferred to each director
subject to forfeiture to the extent that the required performance
conditions are not attained. The executive directors have waived
their entitlement to any dividend on the shares conditionally
transferred to them until the conclusion of the relevant
performance period.
The Company charges against profit each year an amount equal
to one-third of the expected cost of the proportion of the
matching award expected to vest at the end of the three year
performance period.
No awards were made under this plan in the financial year but it is
the Committee's intention to offer awards to senior executives in
relation to their bonuses for the year ended 30 April 2004.
Relative performance
The following graph compares total shareholder return performance
of the Company with the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment
trusts) over the five years ended 30 April 2004. This index was
selected as it is the measure used for performance comparison
under the Company's Investment Incentive Plan.

Directors' pension arrangements
Mr Burnett's pension entitlement is funded through contributions 
to the managed funds of independent fund managers operated
through the Ashtead Group plc Pension Scheme. Mr Burnett's
pension in payment increases in line with price inflation, up to 7% 
a year. A spouse's pension of two-thirds of Mr Burnett's retirement
benefit is payable in the event of his death either before or after
retirement. The Company receives regular advice from external
advisers on the level of contributions required to meet the
anticipated final salary liability. Mr Burnett makes no contribution
towards the cost of his pension entitlement. Under the provisions 
of Mr Burnett's amended contract, for the purpose of the required
disclosure of year end transfer value, the total funds accumulated
within the pension fund are now treated as vested explaining the
significant increase in transfer value at 30 April 2004 despite the
 105,000 reduction in his accrued pension entitlement in the year.
Under the terms of his contract, Mr Robson is entitled to retire at
age 60 on a pension equal to one-thirtieth of his final salary for
each year of pensionable service. He is a member of the Company's
Retirement Benefits Plan, which is a defined benefits scheme, in
respect of his earnings up to the Inland Revenue limit. The pension
in respect of his earnings above that limit is provided by an
unapproved, unfunded retirement benefits arrangement agreed
between him and the Company. Mr Robson's contract also contains
early retirement provisions allowing him to retire and draw a
pension based on actual years of service, but without deduction for
early payment which take effect once he has completed ten years
service with the Company (or at anytime after age 50 if there is a
change of control). Mr Robson pays contributions equal to 5% of
his salary, all of which were paid to the Retirements Benefits Plan 
in the current year.
Mr Dhaiwal's pension benefits are also provided through the
Ashtead Group plc Retirement Benefits Plan in respect of his
earnings up to the Inland Revenue limit. The pension in respect 
of his earnings above that limit is provided by an unapproved,
unfunded retirement benefits arrangement between him and the
Company. His pension rights accrue at the rate of one-sixtieth of 
basic salary for each year of pensionable service and his normal
retirement is at age 65.
Except where otherwise stated above, the Retirement Benefits Plan
provides:
  in the event of death in service or death between leaving service
and retirement while retaining membership of the plan, a spouse's
pension equal to 50% of the member's deferred pension
calculated at the date of death plus a return of his contributions;
  in the event of death in retirement, a spouse's pension equal to
50% of the member's pension at the date of death;
  an option to retire at any time after age 50 with the Company's
consent. Early retirement benefits are reduced by an amount
agreed between the Actuary and the Trustees as reflecting the
cost to the plan of the early retirement;
  pension increases in line with the increase in retail price inflation
up to a limit of currently 5% a year (although the Government is
currently proposing that this limited inflation proofing be
reduced); and
  transfer values do not include discretionary benefits.
Executive directors' service agreements
Following the amendment to Mr Burnett's service agreement on 
18 September 2003, his contract now provides for termination by
either party by the giving of 12 months' notice. The contract further
provides that Mr Burnett is required to give the Company six
months' notice if he wishes to retire on or after attaining the age of
60. Mr Burnett's agreement without compensation to accept
reduction of his notice period to 12 months completed a process in
which he has successively accepted reduction of his notice period
from the original five years without any payment of compensation.
The service agreements between the Company and Mr Robson
(dated 4 August 2000), Mr Dhaiwal (dated 8 July 2002) and Mr
Miller (dated 5 July 2004) are also terminable by either party giving
the other 12 months' notice. The service agreements of the
executive directors all contain suitable non-compete provisions
appropriate to their roles in the Group.
Remuneration policy for non-executive directors
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by
the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association. The
Chairman has a service contract with the Company terminable 
on three months' notice by the Company or immediately by the
members in general meeting. The contract also provides for
compensation following termination by reason of any change of
control equal to 12 months' fees. None of the other non-executive
directors has a service contract with the Company and their
appointment is therefore terminable by the Board at any time.
An ordinary resolution concerning the Group's remuneration
policies will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual
General Meeting.

Notes:
(1) The transfer values represent the amount which would have been paid to another pension scheme had the director elected to take a transfer of his accrued pension entitlement
at that date and have been calculated by the schemes' actuaries in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 published by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of
Actuaries. They are not sums paid or due to the directors concerned.
(2) The increase in transfer value in the year is stated net of the members' contributions made by Mr Robson and Mr Dhaiwal.
The salary shown above for Mr Dressel relates to the period up to
29 July 2003 when his appointment as a director of the Company
and President and Chief Executive Officer of Sunbelt was terminated
with immediate effect. Under the terms of his contract with Sunbelt
he was entitled, subject to certain conditions including an obligation
on his part not to compete with Sunbelt or to solicit any of its
employees for a minimum period of two years, to continue to
receive his annual salary of $400,000 for a matching two year
period. These salary payments, which have been provided in 
full in the financial statements, are disclosed as compensation 
for loss of office when paid. No other payments are due with
respect to Mr Dressel's departure and his participation in the
Investment Incentive Plan and his interest in share options have 
now both lapsed.
Under the latest amendment to his service contract discussed above,
Mr Burnett's pension entitlement now provides for an annual
pension of  275,000 if he retires on 5 April 2005. His pension
entitlement is reduced by  1,100 per annum for each month by
which his date of retirement falls before 5 April 2005 and is
increased by  1,100 for each month his retirement date is later 
than 5 April 2005. 
Mr Dressel was a member of the US defined contribution plan 
to which the Group contributed  1,110 in the year until his
employment was terminated ( 3,511 in 2003). Directors' interests in shares

20 Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2004
Directors' remuneration report The above discretionary options are exercisable subject to the
following performance criteria: 
(i) As was usual at that time, options granted in 1994 and 1995
were not subject to any performance criteria;
(ii) In line with recommendations extant at the time from
Institutional shareholder representative bodies, options granted
in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 were conditional on the
Group achieving real growth in earnings per share of 2% per
annum over any continuous three year period during the option
period; and
(iii) Options granted in 2002 and subsequently now require real
growth in earnings per share of 3% per annum over any
continuous three year period before they become exercisable.
The Remuneration Committee considers that these performance
hurdles were in line with common practice when the options 
were granted.
The market price of the Company's shares at the end of the
financial year was 29.75p and the highest and lowest prices during
the financial year were 37.0p and 7.75p respectively.
Mr Dhaiwal holds 50,000 units under the Cash Incentive Scheme
which were granted to him on 22 February 2000 when he was not
a director. This award is subject to the same performance conditions
as apply to the Company's unapproved share option scheme and is
exercisable in the period from 22 February 2003 to 21 February
2010. If the performance criteria are satisfied at any point during
that period and the options exercised, the difference between the
mid market price of Ashtead Group plc shares on that day and the
grant price of 102p per unit multiplied by the number of units held
will be paid to Mr Dhaiwal by way of a cash award.
