 Directors' 
Remuneration 
Report
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. The report also meets the
relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles
of Good Governance relating to directors' remuneration. As
required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report 
will be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting of
the Company.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company's
members on the  auditable part' of the Directors' Remuneration
Report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the
report has been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations). The report
has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and
unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee 
( the Committee') in accordance with the recommendations of 
the Combined Code. The members of the Committee are Mr Cole
(Chairman), Mr Etheridge and Mr Drabble (appointed 20 April
2005). None of the Committee members has any personal
financial interests, other than as shareholders, in the matters 
to be decided.
The Group's chief executive, Mr Burnett, normally attends the
meetings of the Committee to advise on operational aspects 
of the implementation of existing policies and policy proposals,
except where his own remuneration is concerned, as does the
Non-executive Chairman, Mr Stenham. The company secretary
acts as secretary to the Committee. Under Mr Cole's direction, 
the company secretary and Mr Burnett have responsibility for
ensuring the Committee has the information relevant to its
deliberations. In formulating its policies, the Committee has 
access to professional advice from outside the Company, 
if required, and to publicly available reports and statistics. 
Remuneration policy for executive directors
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate
and retain directors of the high calibre needed to achieve the
Group's objectives and to reward them for enhancing value to
shareholders. The main elements of the remuneration package 
for executive directors and senior management are:
  basic annual salary and benefits in kind; 
  annual performance bonus plan;
 share related incentives, including the Investment Incentive Plan
(a long-term co-investment plan) approved by shareholders on 
8 October 2001 and its successor the Performance Share Plan
approved by shareholders on 20 September 2004; and
  pension arrangements.
In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, the Company
compares packages offered by similar companies, which are
chosen having regard to:
  the size of the company (turnover, profits and number 
of people employed); 
  the diversity and complexity of its businesses; 
  the geographical spread of its businesses; and 
 their growth, expansion and change profile.
In making the comparisons, the Company takes into consideration
the international scope, complexity and speed of change of the
Group's business and, particularly, its significant operations in the
US where the Company has a number of successful, publicly
quoted, competitors who compete with us for top 
management talent. 
The Committee implements its remuneration policies by the 
design of reward packages for executive directors comprising 
the appropriate mix of salary, performance related cash incentive
bonuses and share related incentives. Mr Burnett, with the
approval of the Board, holds two non-executive appointments
outside the Group: he is Chairman of Henderson Strata
Investments plc and is also Chair of the Governors of the Surrey
Institute of Art and Design, University College. The latter position
is unpaid and Mr Burnett is allowed to retain the fees arising from
Henderson Strata Investments plc amounting to  12,500 in the
past year. None of the other executive directors holds any outside
appointments. In the past year the Company obtained advice in
regard to executive directors' salary and incentive rewards from
New Bridge Street Consultants.
Basic salary
An executive director's basic salary is normally determined by the
Committee before the start of the year and when an individual
changes position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels,
the Committee considers the Group as a whole and seeks to be
competitive, but fair, using information provided both by internal
and external sources. 
Effective 1 May 2004, Mr Burnett's salary increased by 17.5% to
 340,725. The increase awarded to Mr Burnett, reflected the fact
that he had voluntarily accepted a reduction in his salary for the
year ended 30 April 2003 from  428,000 to  290,000 and 
the Company's improved performance. Effective from the same
date Mr Robson's salary increased by 3.5% to  207,000 while 
Mr Dhaiwal's salary remained unchanged. Mr Miller was appointed
a director on 6 July 2004 on an annual salary of $350,000.

Annual performance related bonus plans
Under the annual performance related bonus plans for executive
directors, payments for 2004/5 were related directly to financial
performance targets and were subject to a cap at two-thirds of 
a UK based executive director's salary and 100% of a US based
executive director's salary. 
The Committee establishes the objectives that must be met for
each financial year if a cash bonus for that year is to be paid. 
In setting bonus parameters the Committee sets targets that
ensure that such awards are tied to appropriate financial
performance measures.
For the year ended 30 April 2005 the bonus objectives were 
linked to substantially exceeding the financial budgets for that
year. These targets were fully attained and accordingly the
executive directors will be paid their bonuses in full in July 2005.
Share related incentives
Details of the Company's existing arrangements are set out below. 
Share option schemes
It was the Committee's policy to make regular awards to senior
staff in order that their personal interests were aligned with those
of shareholders. The value of the shares underlying the options
awarded was assessed by reference to a number of factors
including the employee's salary, seniority and length of service 
as well as both the Company's and the individual's performance 
in the year prior to the award. There will be no future share option
awards, these arrangements having now been replaced by the
Performance Share Plan described below.
Investment Incentive Plan
The Investment Incentive Plan is a long-term incentive plan which
provides for senior management, who so elect, to invest all or a
portion of their annual cash bonuses in shares of the Company
and, thus, become eligible for matching awards in the form 
of shares which only vest subject to demanding performance
conditions. The Company does not intend currently to make 
any further awards under this plan.
The matching awards are made in respect of investment shares
acquired by the senior management with all or part of their bonus
for the previous financial year. The matching awards only vest, 
in whole or part, based on the annual growth in the Company's
earnings per share ( EPS') in the three year period following the
award over that of the year ended 30 April immediately prior to
the date of the award and on the Company's Total Shareholder
Return ( TSR') performance relative to a comparator group. In
respect of the matching awards granted, the relevant performance
period is the three year periods from 8 October 2001 (when the
Company's share price at close was 72p) to October 2004 for the
awards granted in 2001/2, and 29 July 2002 (when the share price
was 49.5p) to 28 July 2005 for the award granted in 2002/3 
and from 19 August 2004 (when the share price was 48.5p) 
to 18 August 2007 for the awards granted in 2004/5. The
comparator group comprises all of the FTSE 250 mid-cap stocks
other than investment trusts.
The above performance conditions were chosen because they
were felt to align most closely the interests of senior management
with the interests of shareholders, by rewarding management for
achieving superior relative total shareholder return performance
compared with the FTSE 250 as a whole, excluding investment
trusts. At the time the awards were made, the FTSE 250 was
considered to be the Stock Exchange index most appropriate 
to the size and scale of the Company's operations. 
Vesting of the matching awards is based on the following required
performance grid:
Vesting operates on a scaled basis for performance between the
target levels shown in the grid above. Performance is measured 
at the end of the three year performance period when the awards
either vest in full or part or lapse completely. For performance
measurement purposes earnings per share is based on the profit
before exceptional items measured under consistently applied
accounting policies. In connection with the operation of the plan,
the Company established an Employee Share Ownership Trust
which held 2,723,461 shares as at 30 April 2005.
The minimum EPS for the 2001/2 awards was not achieved and
accordingly these awards lapsed in 2004. Based on the results for
the year ended 30 April 2005, average EPS growth in the three
year period to 30 April 2005 was 8.4% above RPI meaning that
actual performance has exceeded the upper level target.
Accordingly the 2002/3 awards will now vest on 28 July 2005,
being the third anniversary of the date of grant, with the final
vesting being dependent on the final TSR for the three year 
period ended on that date.

No Matching Award Vests The Company charges against profit each year an amount 
equal to one-third of the expected cost of the proportion of the
matching award expected to vest at the end of the three year
performance period.
Performance Share Plan
The Performance Share Plan is a long-term incentive plan under
which executive directors and other senior management may
annually receive a conditional right to acquire shares ( performance
shares'), the vesting of which depends on the satisfaction of
demanding performance conditions. 
The maximum award of performance shares that may be made 
in any financial year of the Company is limited under the rules 
of the Plan, to shares with a market value equal to 100% of the
participant's base salary at the time the award is made. However,
the initial awards under the plan granted in October 2004, did 
not exceed 50% of any participant's salary.
The extent to which the initial awards vest depends as to 50% 
of the award on the EPS in the three year period ended 30 April
2007 and the other 50% on the Company's TSR performance over
the three year period ending 5 October 2007 against that of the
constituents of the FTSE Smallcap Index (excluding investment
trusts) over the same period.
The proportion of the award relating to EPS growth is exercisable
in full if EPS for the year ended 30 April 2007 is 8p per share or
greater and will lapse if EPS is below 5p. Awards are scaled for
performance between these points. EPS for this purpose is
calculated on the Group's profit before exceptional items, goodwill
amortisation and tax less a standard 30% tax charge. Additionally,
appropriate adjustments are to be made to the 5p and 8p targets
by the Committee to reflect the impact of applying International
Financial Reporting Standards.
The proportion of the award linked to TSR will vest in full if the
Company's TSR growth for the three year period ended 5 October
2007 ranks in the top 25% of the companies (excluding
investment trusts) included in the FTSE Smallcap Index as at 
6 October 2004. The TSR portion of the award will lapse if the
Company's relative TSR growth is ranked at or below 50% for this
period and it will be scaled on a pro rata basis if actual TSR growth
is between these points. 
Relative performance
The following graph compares total shareholder return
performance of the Company with the FTSE Smallcap Index
(excluding investment trusts) over the five years ended 
30 April 2005. This index was selected, as it is the measure 
used for performance comparison under the Company's
Performance Share Plan.
Directors' pension arrangements
Mr Burnett's pension entitlement is funded through contributions
to the managed funds of independent fund managers operated
through the Ashtead Group plc Pension Scheme. Mr Burnett's
pension in payment increases in line with price inflation, up to 7%
a year. A spouse's pension of two-thirds of Mr Burnett's retirement
benefit is payable in the event of his death either before or after
retirement. The Company receives regular advice from external
advisers on the level of contributions required to meet the
anticipated final salary liability. Mr Burnett makes no contribution
towards the cost of his pension entitlement. 
Under the terms of his contract, Mr Robson is entitled to retire 
at age 60 on a pension equal to one-thirtieth of his final salary 
for each year of pensionable service. He is a member of the
Company's Retirement Benefits Plan, which is a defined benefits
scheme, in respect of his earnings up to the Inland Revenue limit.
The pension in respect of his earnings above that limit is provided
by an unapproved, unfunded retirement benefits arrangement
agreed between him and the Company. Mr Robson's contract 
also contains early retirement provisions allowing him to retire 
and draw a pension based on actual years of service, but without
deduction for early payment which take effect once he has
completed ten years' service with the Company (or at any time
after age 50 if there is a change of control). Mr Robson pays
contributions equal to 7.5% (5% up to 31 December 2004) of 
his salary, all of which were paid to the Retirements Benefits Plan
in the current year.
Mr Dhaiwal's pension benefits are also provided through the
Ashtead Group plc Retirement Benefits Plan in respect of his
earnings up to the Inland Revenue limit. The pension in respect 
of his earnings above that limit is provided by an unapproved,
unfunded retirement benefits arrangement between him and the
Company. His pension rights accrue at the rate of one-sixtieth of
basic salary for each year of pensionable service and his normal
retirement is at age 65.

Except where otherwise stated above, the Retirement Benefits 
Plan provides:
 in the event of death in service or death between leaving 
service and retirement while retaining membership of the 
plan, a spouse's pension equal to 50% of the member's
deferred pension calculated at the date of death plus a 
return of his contributions;
 in the event of death in retirement, a spouse's pension equal 
to 50% of the member's pension at the date of death;
  an option to retire at any time after age 50 with the Company's
consent. Early retirement benefits are reduced by an amount
agreed between the Actuary and the Trustees as reflecting the
cost to the plan of the early retirement;
  pension increases in line with the increase in retail price inflation
up to a limit of currently 5% a year (although the Government
is currently proposing that this limited inflation proofing be
reduced); and
  transfer values do not include discretionary benefits.

Executive directors' service agreements
Mr Burnett's service agreement dated 18 September 2003
provides for termination by either party by the giving of 
12 months' notice. His contract further provides that Mr Burnett 
is required to give the Company only six months' notice if he
wishes to retire on or after attaining the age of 60.
The service agreements between the Company and Mr Robson
(dated 4 August 2000), Mr Dhaiwal (dated 8 July 2002) and 
Mr Miller (dated 5 July 2004) are also terminable by either party
giving the other 12 months' notice. The service agreements of 
the executive directors all contain suitable non-compete provisions
appropriate to their roles in the Group.
Remuneration policy for non-executive directors
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined 
by the chairman and chief executive within limits set out in the
Articles of Association. The chairman has a service contract (dated
22 October 2003) with the Company terminable on three months'
notice by the Company or immediately by the members in general
meeting. The contract also provides for compensation following
termination by reason of any change of control equal to 12
months' fees. None of the other non-executive directors has 
a service contract with the Company and their appointment 
is therefore terminable by the Board at any time.
An ordinary resolution concerning the Group's remuneration
policies will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming annual
general meeting. Directors'

Notes:
(1) The transfer values represent the amount which would have been paid to another pension scheme had the director elected to take a transfer of his accrued pension
entitlement at that date and have been calculated by the schemes' actuaries in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 published by the Institute of Actuaries 
and the Faculty of Actuaries. They are not sums paid or due to the directors concerned.
(2) The increase in transfer value in the year is stated net of the members' contributions made by Mr Robson and Mr Dhaiwal.
As set out in last year's remuneration report, the compensation 
for loss of office paid to Mr Dressel was under the terms of his
contract with Sunbelt whereby he was entitled, subject to certain
conditions including an obligation not to compete with Sunbelt or
to solicit any of its employees for a minimum of two years, to
continue to receive his annual salary of $400,000 for a matching
two year period which expires on 28 July 2005. These salary
payments have been provided in full in the financial statements.
Mr Burnett's pension entitlement provides for an annual pension
of  275,000 if he had retired on 5 April 2005. His pension is
increased by  1,100 for each month his retirement date is later
than 5 April 2005.

Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2005 
During the year options over 491,400 shares held by Mr Burnett
and originally awarded to him in August 1994 under the then
executive option plan at the exercise price of 61.44p per 
share lapsed. 
The above discretionary options, granted three years prior to 
the earliest exercise date, are exercisable subject to the following
performance criteria: 
(i) As was usual at that time, options granted in 1995, 1997 
and 1998 were not subject to any performance criteria.
(ii) In line with recommendations extant at the time from
Institutional shareholder representative bodies, options
granted in 1999, 2000 and 2001 were conditional on the
Group achieving real growth in earnings per share of 2% 
per annum over any continuous three year period during 
the option period.
(iii) Options granted in 2002 and subsequently require real growth
in earnings per share of 3% per annum over any continuous
three year period before they become exercisable.
The Remuneration Committee considers that these performance
hurdles were in line with common practice when the options 
were granted.
The market price of the Company's shares at the end of the
financial year was 86.75p and the highest and lowest prices
during the financial year were 106.00p and 24.00p respectively.
Mr Dhaiwal holds 50,000 units under the Cash Incentive Scheme
which were granted to him on 22 February 2000 when he was
not a director. This award is subject to the same performance
conditions as apply to the Company's unapproved share option
scheme and is exercisable in the period from 22 February 2003 
to 21 February 2010. If the performance criteria are satisfied at
any point during that period and the options exercised, the
difference between the mid market price of Ashtead Group plc
shares on that day and the grant price of 102p per unit multiplied
by the number of units held will be paid to Mr Dhaiwal by way of
a cash award.
