Directors' remuneration report
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' 
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. The report also meets the 
relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of 
Good Governance relating to directors' remuneration. As required by 
the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed  
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company's 
members on the  auditable part' of the Directors' Remuneration Report 
and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as 
amended by the Regulations). The report has therefore been divided 
into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee ( the 
Committee') in accordance with the recommendations of the  
Combined Code. The members of the Committee throughout the  
year were Mr Cole (chairman), Mr Etheridge and Mr Drabble. None  
of the Committee members has any personal financial interests,  
other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
The Group's chief executive, Mr Burnett, normally attends the meetings  
of the Committee to advise on operational aspects of the implementation 
of existing policies and policy proposals, except where his own 
remuneration is concerned, as does the non-executive chairman,  
Mr Stenham. The company secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. 
Under Mr Cole's direction, the company secretary and Mr Burnett have 
responsibility for ensuring the Committee has the information relevant to 
its deliberations. In formulating its policies, the Committee has access to 
professional advice from outside the Company, if required, and to publicly 
available reports and statistics. External professional advice was obtained 
in the year from The Zygos Partnership.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate  
and retain directors of the high calibre needed to achieve the Group's 
objectives and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The 
main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors and 
senior management are: 
basic annual salary and benefits in kind; 
annual performance related bonus plan;
share related incentives; and
pension arrangements.
In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, the Company compares 
packages offered by similar companies, which are chosen having  
regard to:
 
 
 
 
the size of the company (revenues, profits and number of people 
employed); 
the diversity and complexity of its businesses; 
the geographical spread of its businesses; and 
their growth, expansion and change profile.
 
In making the comparisons, the Company takes into consideration the 
international scope, complexity and speed of change of the Group's 
business and, particularly, its significant operations in the US where the 
Company has a number of larger, successful competitors who compete 
with it for top management talent. 
The Committee implements its remuneration policies by the design of 
reward packages for executive directors comprising the appropriate mix 
of salary, performance related annual cash incentive bonuses and share 
related incentives. Mr Burnett, with the approval of the Board, holds  
two non-executive appointments outside the Group: he is chairman of 
Henderson Strata Investments plc and is also chair of the Governors of 
University College for the Creative Arts. The latter position is unpaid and 
Mr Burnett is allowed to retain the fees arising from Henderson Strata 
Investments plc amounting to  12,500 in the past year. None of the other 
executive directors holds any outside appointments.
Basic salary
An executive director's basic salary is normally determined by the 
Committee before the start of the year and when an individual changes 
position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee 
considers the Group as a whole and seeks to be competitive, but fair, 
using information drawn from both internal and external sources. 
In recognition of the substantial growth in the Company's market 
capitalisation achieved in the year ended 30 April 2005, the 
Remuneration Committee concluded that a significant upwards revision 
to the salaries of the executive directors was appropriate for the year  
to 30 April 2006 just as the salaries of Mr Burnett and Mr Robson had 
been adjusted downwards in 2003 in the light of the reduction in the 
Company's market capitalisation at that time. Accordingly, effective 
1 May 2005 the following salary increases were implemented: 
 
 Percentage  Revised 
 increase salary
George Burnett 25.6%  428,000
Ian Robson 25.6%  260,000
Sat Dhaiwal 20.0%  180,000
Cliff Miller 20.0% $420,000
Annual performance related bonus plan
Under the annual performance related bonus plan for executive directors, 
except for the additional payment to Mr Robson discussed below, 
payments for the year to 30 April 2006 were related directly to financial 
performance targets and were subject to a cap of 100% of salary. The 
 
 
 
  25  Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 www.ashtead-group.com
Committee establishes the objectives that must be met for each financial 
year if a cash incentive bonus for that year is to be paid. In determining 
bonus parameters the Committee's objective is to set targets that reflect 
appropriately challenging financial performance measures.
For the year ended 30 April 2006, the Group and Sunbelt fully attained 
their respective financial targets and accordingly Mr Burnett, Mr Robson 
and Mr Miller will be paid their 2005/6 performance related bonus in  
full in July 2006. In addition, Mr Robson was paid a discretionary 
performance bonus during the year of  40,000 in recognition of  
his performance in delivering the complete restructuring of the  
Group's debt finances over the 18 months culminating in last August's 
successful capital reorganisation. A-Plant partially attained its 2005/6 
targets and accordingly Mr Dhaiwal will be paid a proportionate bonus 
in July 2006.
 
Share related incentives
Details of the Company's existing arrangements are set out below. 
Previous plans
Executive share option schemes
Until 2002, it was the Committee's policy to make regular awards under 
the Company's executive share plans to senior staff. The value of the 
shares underlying the options awarded was assessed by reference  
to a number of factors including the employee's salary, seniority and 
length of service as well as both the Company's and the individual's 
performance in the year prior to the award. No further executive share 
option awards are planned.
Investment Incentive Plan
The Investment Incentive Plan is a long-term incentive plan which 
provided for senior management, who so elected, to invest all or a 
portion of their annual cash bonuses in shares of the Company and, 
thus, become eligible for matching awards in the form of shares which 
only vest subject to demanding performance conditions. The Company 
does not intend currently to make any further awards under this plan.
Matching awards were made in respect of investment shares acquired by 
participants with all or part of their bonus for the previous financial year. 
The matching awards only vest, in whole or part, based on annual growth 
in the Company's earnings per share ( EPS') in the three year period 
following the award over that of the year ended 30 April immediately prior 
to the date of the award and on the Company's Total Shareholder Return 
( TSR') performance relative to a comparator group. In respect of the 
remaining available matching awards, the relevant performance period  
is the three years from 19 August 2004 (when the share price was 48.5p) 
to 18 August 2007. The comparator group comprises all of the FTSE 250 
mid-cap stocks other than investment trusts.
The above performance conditions were chosen because they were  
felt to align most closely the interests of senior management with the 
interests of shareholders, by rewarding management for achieving 
superior relative total shareholder return performance compared with 
the FTSE 250 as a whole, excluding investment trusts. At the time the 
awards were made, the FTSE 250 was considered to be the Stock 
Exchange index most appropriate to the size and scale of the 
Company's operations.
 
Vesting of the matching awards is based on the following required 
performance grid:
Real EPS 
growth 
performance
TSR performance against peer group
Below median TSR Median
63rd 
percentile
75th

No matching award vests
Vesting operates on a scaled basis for performance between the target 
levels shown in the grid above. Performance is measured at the end of 
the three year performance period when the awards either vest in full  
or part or lapse completely. For performance measurement purposes 
earnings per share is based on the profit before exceptional items 
measured under consistently applied accounting policies and using  
a 30% standardised tax rate.
Current plan
Performance Share Plan
The Performance Share Plan is a long-term incentive plan under which 
executive directors and other members of the senior management team 
may annually receive a conditional right to acquire shares ( performance 
shares'), the vesting of which depends on the satisfaction of demanding 
performance conditions. 
The maximum award of performance shares that may be made in any 
financial year of the Company is limited under the rules of the Plan, to 
shares with a market value equal to 100% of the participant's base 
salary at the time the award is made. To date no award has exceeded 
70% of salary. 26  Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 International equipment rental

The extent to which the awards vest depends as to 50% of the award 
on growth in EPS over the three year vesting period which runs for the 
awards granted in 2004 for the three years ending 30 April 2007 and for 
the awards granted in 2005 for the three years ending 30 April 2008.
The vesting of the other 50% of the awards is dependent upon the 
Company's TSR performance over the three years commencing on 
award date (5 October 2004 for the 2004 awards and 16 August 2005 
for the 2005 awards) against the relevant index. For the 2004 awards 
this was the FTSE SmallCap index (excluding investment trusts) whilst, 
for the 2005 awards, it was the constituents of the FTSE 250 index 
(excluding investment trusts). 
 
The part of each award relating to EPS growth depends on the level of 
EPS for the year ending 30 April 2007 for the 2004 award and for the 
year ending 30 April 2008 for the 2005 award. For the 2004 award, the 
award vests in full if EPS for 2006/7 is 8p or greater and lapses if EPS is 
5p or lower. The equivalent thresholds for the 2005 award in the 2007/8 
year are 9.1p and 7.7p. Awards are scaled for performance between 
these points. EPS for this purpose is calculated on the Group's profit 
before exceptional items less a standardised 30% tax charge. The EPS 
targets noted above have not yet been adjusted by the Committee to 
reflect the impact of the Group's subsequent application of International 
Financial Reporting Standards but this will be considered by the 
Committee at the time the awards mature.
Directors' remuneration report continued
The part of each award linked to TSR vests in full if the Company's TSR 
growth over the three year vesting period ranks it in the top 25% of 
participants in the relevant index and will lapse if the Company's relative 
TSR growth is ranked at or below 50% of participants in the relevant 
index over the three year vesting period. If relative TSR performance is 
between these points, the TSR linked part of the award is scaled on a 
pro rata basis.
Employee Share Ownership Trust
The Group has established an Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) 
to hold shares in the Company to satisfy potential awards under the 
Investment Incentive Plan and the Performance Share Plan. At 30 April 
2006, the ESOT held a beneficial interest in 4,721,490 shares. The ESOT 
owned directly 2,286,959 of these shares and a further 2,434,531 shares 
were registered in the name of Investment Incentive Plan or Performance 
Share Plan participants on terms which require that the award shares are 
transferred back to the ESOT to the extent that the performance targets 
are not met.
 
Relative performance
The following graph compares the Company's TSR performance with 
the FTSE 250 index (excluding investment trusts) over the five years 
ended 30 April 2006, the Stock Exchange index the Committee 
considers to be the most appropriate to the size and scale of the 
Company's operations.  27  Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 www.ashtead-group.com
Directors' pension arrangements
During the year the Company agreed with Mr Burnett that his 
remuneration from 6 April 2006 would be non-pensionable and also that 
the Company's pension obligation to Mr Burnett at 6 April 2006 under 
the terms of his employment contract would be satisfied in full by the 
transfer to a private personal pension scheme established by Mr Burnett 
of all the assets then held by the Ashtead Group plc Pension Scheme of 
which Mr Burnett was the sole remaining member. The value of these 
assets at 6 April 2006 was  10.3m and the transfer to Mr Burnett's new 
personal pension plan was concluded on 29 April 2006.
Under the terms of his contract, Mr Robson is entitled to retire at age  
60 on a pension equal to one-thirtieth of his final salary for each year  
of pensionable service. He is a member of the Company's Retirement 
Benefits Plan, which is a defined benefits scheme. Following the change 
in pension plan and Inland Revenue regulations effective 6 April 2006, 
the Company has agreed with the trustees of the Retirement Benefits 
Plan that the Retirement Benefits Plan will now be responsible for  
Mr Robson's entire pension, part of which was previously provided  
by the Company. Mr Robson's contract also contains early retirement 
provisions allowing him to retire and draw a pension based on actual 
years of service, but without deduction for early payment which take 
effect once he has completed 10 years' service with the Company (or  
at any time after age 50 if there is a change of control). Mr Robson pays 
contributions equal to 7.5% of his salary to the Retirement Benefits Plan.
Mr Dhaiwal's pension benefits are also now provided entirely through 
the Ashtead Group plc Retirement Benefits Plan. His pension rights 
accrue at the rate of one-sixtieth of salary (as defined) for each year  
of pensionable service and his normal retirement date is at age 65.  
Mr Dhaiwal also pays contributions equal to 7.5% of his salary to the 
Retirement Benefits Plan.
Except where otherwise stated above, the Retirement Benefits Plan 
provides:
in the event of death in service or death between leaving service and 
retirement while retaining membership of the plan, a spouse's 
pension equal to 50% of the member's deferred pension calculated 
at the date of death plus a return of his contributions;
in the event of death in retirement, a spouse's pension equal to 50% 
of the member's pension at the date of death;
 
 
an option to retire at any time after age 50 with the Company's 
consent. Early retirement benefits are reduced by an amount agreed 
between the Actuary and the Trustees as reflecting the cost to the 
plan of the early retirement. After 2010, Government regulations raise 
the minimum early retirement age to 55;
pension increases in line with the increase in retail price inflation up  
to a limit of currently 5% a year; and
transfer values do not include discretionary benefits.
In February 2006, Mr Miller ceased contributing to Sunbelt's 401K defined 
contribution pension plan and joined Sunbelt's deferred compensation 
plan. Under the deferred compensation plan Mr Miller has elected to  
defer 6% of his annual salary and a proportion of his annual performance 
bonus, which is retained by Sunbelt in an account designated for his 
benefit to be paid to him on retirement. Sunbelt provides a co-match  
at the rate of $1 for every $1 deferred up to $7 ,500 per annum.
Executive directors' service agreements
Mr Burnett's service agreement dated 18 September 2003 provides  
for termination by either party by the giving of 12 months' notice. The 
contract further provides that Mr Burnett need give the Company only 
six months' notice if he wishes to retire on or after attaining the age of 
60 in September 2006. The service agreements between the Company 
and Mr Robson (dated 4 August 2000), Mr Dhaiwal (dated 8 July 2002) 
and Mr Miller (dated 5 July 2004) are also terminable by either party 
giving the other 12 months' notice. The service agreements for each of 
the executive directors all contain non-compete provisions appropriate 
to their roles in the Group.
Remuneration policy for non-executive directors
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the 
chairman and chief executive within limits set out in the Articles of 
Association. The chairman has a service contract (dated 22 October 
2003) with the Company terminable on three months' notice by the 
Company or immediately by the members in general meeting. The 
contract also provides for compensation following termination by reason 
of any change of control equal to 12 months' fees. None of the other 
non-executive directors has a service contract with the Company and 
their appointment is therefore terminable by the Board at any time.
An ordinary resolution concerning the Group's remuneration policies will 
be put to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Key management 
As noted above, all the assets then held by the Ashtead Group plc 
Pension Scheme of which Mr Burnett was the sole remaining member 
were vested in him on 6 April 2006 in full settlement of the Company's 
pension obligation to him under his employment contract and his 
employment subsequent to that date is non-pensionable. The value  
of the assets so vested at 6 April 2006 was  10.3m. 
Mr Miller contributed to the US defined contribution plan until February 
2006, to which his employer, Sunbelt, contributed  5,087 in the year.  
In February 2006, Mr Miller joined the Sunbelt deferred compensation 
plan to which Sunbelt had allocated  2,730 by 30 April 2006 and the 
amount due to Mr Miller at 30 April 2006 was  5,445.

Note
On 23 September 2005, Mr Burnett exercised an option originally granted to him in September 1995 under the Company's executive share option plan to acquire 487,494 shares at a price of 
72.535p per share and sold all of the acquired shares on the same day at the then market price of 140p per share. On 14 July 2005, Mr Dhaiwal exercised an option originally granted to him in 
February 2002 under the Company's executive share option plan to acquire 72,000 shares at a price of 41.5p per share and sold all of the acquired shares on the same day at the then market 
price of 110p per share. On 8 August 2005 following achievement of the relevant performance conditions, the matching award granted to Mr Robson on 8 August 2002 under the Investment 
Incentive Plan vested in full and accordingly 176,469 shares were transferred to Mr Robson at a time when the market price was 114.25p per share. Mr Robson sold 50,579 shares to partially 
fund the tax liability resulting from vesting of the matching award and retained 125,890 shares. 
Directors' remuneration report continued
Exercise of certain of the above listed discretionary option awards were 
subject to performance conditions when originally granted, all of which 
have been met subsequently. The market price of the Company's 
shares at the end of the financial year was 235p and the highest and 
lowest prices during the financial year were 238p and 85.5p respectively.
Mr Dhaiwal also holds 50,000 units in the Company's Cash Incentive 
Scheme which were granted to him on 22 February 2000 when he was 
not a director. The performance criteria related to this award have been 
satisfied and accordingly Mr Dhaiwal may exercise the award in whole 
or in part at any time prior to 22 February 2010. When the award is 
exercised Mr Dhaiwal will be paid in cash an amount equal to the 
difference between the mid market price of Ashtead Group plc shares 
on the day of exercise and 102p multiplied by the number of units 
exercised. The resultant sum will be paid to Mr Dhaiwal in cash less 
applicable taxes.
