 ASHTEAD GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT 40
INTRODUCTION
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. The report also meets the relevant
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and
describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance
relating to directors' remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a
resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the forthcoming
Annual General Meeting of the Company.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company's members
on the auditable part  of the Directors' Remuneration Report and to state
whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the
Regulations). The report has therefore been divided into separate sections
for audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee (the Committee )
in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code. The
members of the Committee are Mr Iceton (chairman), Mr Etheridge and
Mr Burrow. None of the Committee members has any personal financial
interests, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
The Group's chief executive, Mr Drabble, normally attends the meetings of
the Committee to advise on operational aspects of the implementation of
existing policies and policy proposals, except where his own remuneration 
is concerned, as does the non-executive chairman, Mr Cole. The company
secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. Under Mr Iceton's direction,
the company secretary and Mr Drabble have responsibility for ensuring the
Committee has the information relevant to its deliberations. In formulating
its policies, the Committee has access to professional advice from outside
the Company, as required, and to publicly available reports and statistics.
External professional advice was obtained in the year from The Zygos
Partnership who assisted also in the recruitment of non-executive directors.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and
retain directors of the high calibre needed to achieve the Group's objectives
and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The main
elements of the remuneration package for executive directors and senior
management are:
 
basic annual salary and benefits in kind;
 
annual performance related bonus plan;
 
share related incentives; and
 
pension arrangements.
In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, the Company compares
packages offered by similar companies, which are chosen having regard to:
 
the size of the company (revenues, profits and number of people
employed);
 
the diversity and complexity of its businesses;
 
the geographical spread of its businesses; and 
 
their growth, expansion and change profile.
In making the comparisons, the Company takes into consideration also 
the Group's significant operations in the US where the Company has a
number of large, successful competitors who compete with it for top
management talent.
The Committee implements its remuneration policies by the design of
reward packages for executive directors comprising the appropriate mix of
salary, performance related annual cash incentive bonuses and share related
incentives. None of the executive directors holds any outside appointments.
Basic salary
An executive director's basic salary is normally determined by the
Committee before the start of the year and when an individual changes
position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee
considers the Group as a whole and seeks to be competitive, but fair,
using information drawn from both internal and external sources.
Annual performance related bonus plan
Under the annual performance related bonus plan for executive directors,
payments for the year to 30 April 2007 were related directly to financial
and personal performance targets and were subject to a cap of 150% of
salary for Mr Burnett, Mr Drabble, Mr Robson and Mr Miller and 100% of
salary for Mr Dhaiwal. The Committee establishes the objectives that must
be met for each financial year if a cash incentive bonus for that year is 
to be paid. In determining bonus parameters the Committee's objective 
is to set targets that reflect appropriately challenging financial performance
measures.
For the year ended 30 April 2007, the targets relating to Mr Burnett and 
Mr Dhaiwal were met in full and accordingly they received 100% of their
maximum bonus entitlements. The targets for Mr Drabble, Mr Robson and
Mr Miller were met in part and accordingly, they received 73%, 73% and
67% of their maximum bonuses respectively.

Share related incentives
Details of the Company's existing arrangements are set out below.
Previous plans
Executive share option schemes
Until 2002, it was the Committee's policy to make regular awards under
the Company's executive share option plans to senior staff. The value of 
the shares underlying the options awarded was assessed by reference to 
a number of factors including the employee's salary, seniority and length 
of service as well as both the Company's and the individual's performance
in the year prior to the award. This plan lapsed in October 2006.
Investment Incentive Plan
The Investment Incentive Plan is a long-term incentive plan which provided
for senior management, who so elected, to invest all or a portion of their
annual cash bonuses in shares of the Company and, thus, become eligible
for matching awards in the form of shares which only vest subject to
demanding performance conditions. The Company did not make any awards
under this plan in 2005/6 or 2006/7. The Company does not intend to
make any further awards under this plan.
Matching awards were made in respect of investment shares acquired by
participants with all or part of their bonus for the previous financial year.
The matching awards only vest, in whole or part, based on annual growth in
the Company's earnings per share (EPS ) in the three year period following
the award over that of the year ended 30 April immediately prior to the
date of the award and on the Company's Total Shareholder Return (TSR )
performance relative to a comparator group. In respect of the remaining
available matching awards, the relevant performance period is the three
years from 19 August 2004 (when the share price was 48.5p) to 18 August
2007. The comparator group comprises all of the FTSE 250 mid-cap stocks
other than investment trusts.
The above performance conditions were chosen because they were felt to
align most closely the interests of senior management with the interests of
shareholders, by rewarding management for achieving superior relative total
shareholder return performance compared with the FTSE 250 as a whole,
excluding investment trusts. At the time the awards were made, the FTSE
250 was considered to be the Stock Exchange index most appropriate to
the size and scale of the Company's operations.
Vesting of the matching awards is based on the following required
performance grid:
Vesting operates on a scaled basis for performance between the target
levels shown in the grid above. Performance is measured at the end of the
three year performance period when the awards either vest in full or part or
lapse completely. For performance measurement purposes earnings per share
is based on the profit before exceptional items measured under consistently
applied accounting policies and using a 30% standardised tax rate.
Current plan
Performance Share Plan
The Performance Share Plan is a long-term incentive plan under which
executive directors and other members of the senior management team
may annually receive a conditional right to acquire shares (performance
shares ), the vesting of which depends on the satisfaction of demanding
performance conditions.
The maximum award of performance shares that may be made in any
financial year of the Company is limited under the rules of the Plan, to
shares with a market value equal to 100% of the participant's base salary
at the time the award is made.
The extent to which the 2004 and 2005 awards vest depends as to 50% 
of the award on growth in EPS over the three year vesting period which runs
for the awards granted in 2004 for the three years ending 30 April 2007
and for the awards granted in 2005 for the three years ending 30 April 2008.

For the 2004 award, 50% of the award for EPS growth vests in full if EPS 
for 2006/7 is 8p or greater and lapses if EPS is 5p or lower. EPS for the year
ended 30 April 2007 has exceeded the upper threshold; consequently, the
50% element of the 2004 awards relating to EPS growth will vest in full.
The equivalent thresholds for the 2005 award in the 2007/8 year are 9.1p
and 7.7p. Awards are scaled for performance between these points. EPS for
this purpose is calculated on the Group's profit before exceptional items
less a standardised 30% tax charge. The EPS targets noted above have not
yet been adjusted by the Committee to reflect the impact of the Group's
subsequent application of International Financial Reporting Standards but
this will be considered by the Committee at the time the awards mature.
The vesting of the other 50% of the awards is dependent upon the
Company's TSR performance over the three years commencing on award
date (5 October 2004 for the 2004 awards and 16 August 2005 for the
2005 awards) against the relevant index. For the 2004 awards this was the
FTSE Smallcap index (excluding investment trusts) whilst, for the 2005
awards, it was the constituents of the FTSE 250 index (excluding
investment trusts).
The part of each award linked to TSR vests in full if the Company's TSR
growth over the three year vesting period ranks it in the top 25% of
participants in the relevant index and will lapse if the Company's relative
TSR growth is ranked at or below 50% of participants in the relevant index
over the three year vesting period. If relative TSR performance is between
these points, the TSR linked part of the award is scaled on a pro rata basis.
Source: Datastream
The extent to which the 2006 awards vest depends entirely on the growth 
in EPS over the three year vesting period which runs for the three years
ending 30 April 2009. For the 2006 award, the award vests in full if EPS 
for 2008/9 is 19p or greater and lapses if EPS is 16.8p or lower. Awards 
are scaled for performance between these points. EPS for this purpose 
is calculated on the Group's profit before exceptional items less a
standardised 30% tax charge.
Employee Share Ownership Trust
The Group has established an Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) 
to hold shares in the Company to satisfy potential awards under the
Investment Incentive Plan and the Performance Share Plan. At 30 April
2007, the ESOT held a beneficial interest in 8,290,747 shares. The ESOT
owned directly 4,932,329 of these shares and a further 3,358,418 shares
were registered in the name of Investment Incentive Plan or Performance
Share Plan participants on terms which require that the award shares are
transferred back to the ESOT to the extent that the performance targets
are not met.
Relative performance
The following graph compares the Company's TSR performance with the
FTSE 250 index (excluding investment trusts) over the five years ended
30 April 2007, the Stock Exchange index the Committee considers to be
the most appropriate to the size and scale of the Company's operations.

Directors' pension arrangements
The Company makes a payment of 40% of his base salary to Mr Drabble 
in lieu of providing him with any pension arrangements.
Under the terms of his contract, Mr Robson is entitled to retire at age 60
on a pension equal to one-thirtieth of his final salary for each year of
pensionable service. He is a member of the Company's Retirement Benefits
Plan, which is a defined benefits scheme. Following the change in pension
plan and Inland Revenue regulations effective 6 April 2006, the Company
has agreed with the trustees of the Retirement Benefits Plan that the
Retirement Benefits Plan is responsible for Mr Robson's entire pension, part
of which was previously provided by the Company. Mr Robson's contract
also contains early retirement provisions allowing him to retire and draw a
pension based on actual years of service, but without deduction for early
payment which take effect once he has completed 10 years service with
the Company (or at anytime after age 50 if there is a change of control).
Mr Robson pays contributions equal to 7.5% of his salary to the
Retirements Benefits Plan.
Mr Dhaiwal's pension benefits are also provided entirely through the
Ashtead Group plc Retirement Benefits Plan. His pension rights accrue at
the rate of one-sixtieth of salary (as defined) for each year of pensionable
service and his normal retirement date is at age 65. Mr Dhaiwal also pays
contributions equal to 7.5% of his salary to the Retirement Benefits Plan.
The Retirement Benefits Plan also provides that:
 
in the event of death in service or death between leaving service and
retirement while retaining membership of the plan, a spouse's pension
equal to 50% of the member's deferred pension calculated at the date 
of death plus a return of his contributions;
 
in the event of death in retirement, a spouse's pension equal to 50% 
of the member's pension at the date of death;
 
an option to retire at any time after age 50 with the Company's consent.
Early retirement benefits are reduced by an amount agreed between the
Actuary and the Trustees as reflecting the cost to the plan of the early
retirement. In 2010, Government regulations raise the minimum early
retirement age to 55; and
 
pension increases in line with the increase in retail price inflation up 
to a limit of currently 5% a year in respect of service since 1997.
In February 2006, Mr Miller ceased contributing to Sunbelt's 401K defined
contribution pension plan and joined Sunbelt's deferred compensation plan.
Under the deferred compensation plan Mr Miller has elected to defer 6% of
his annual salary and a proportion of his annual performance bonus, which
is retained by Sunbelt in an account designated for his benefit to be paid to
him on retirement. Sunbelt provides a co-match at the rate of $1 for every
$1 deferred up to $12,500 per annum and Mr Miller's deferred salary
account is also credited annually with an investment return  equivalent 
to that earned by members of Sunbelt's 401K pension plan.
Executive directors' service agreements
The service agreements between the Company and Mr Drabble (dated 
6 July 2006), Mr Robson (dated 4 August 2000), Mr Dhaiwal (dated 8 July
2002) and Mr Miller (dated 5 July 2004) are terminable by either party
giving the other 12 months' notice. The service agreements for each of the
executive directors all contain non-compete provisions appropriate to their
roles in the Group.
Following his retirement on 31 December 2006 and in the light of the
death of Mr Stenham during the year arrangements were made with 
Mr Burnett for him to be available to the Company as reasonably required
until 31 December 2007. He will receive  70,000 under these consultancy
arrangements.
Remuneration policy for non-executive directors
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the
Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association. None of the 
non-executive directors has a service contract with the Company and 
their appointment is therefore terminable by the Board at any time.
An ordinary resolution concerning the Group's remuneration policies 
will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Sunbelt's head office in Charlotte and the payment of 40% of salary in lieu of pension contributions and a contribution to relocation costs for Mr Drabble.
Upon commencement of his employment with the Company, Mr Drabble was awarded 378,000 Ashtead ordinary shares to compensate him for his
foregone option arrangements with his previous employer. These shares were awarded to him in October 2006 when the market price was 145.6p and 
the value of the shares awarded was  550,000. Mr Drabble sold 182,683 of these shares at a market price of 142.75p on 8 November 2006 to fund the
income tax and national insurance due on the share award.
As part of his joining arrangements it was agreed that Mr Drabble would also receive an additional bonus payment of  175,000 to compensate him 
for the loss of his accrued bonus with his previous employer, payable concurrently with his 2006/7 bonus. Consequently, the bonus of  438,000 shown 
in the table above for Mr Drabble comprises his regular earned bonus for the year to 30 April 2007 of 110% of salary ( 263,000) plus the special bonus 
of  175,000.

Notes:
(1) The transfer values represent the amount which would have been paid to another pension scheme had the director elected to take a transfer of his accrued pension entitlement at that date and have
been calculated by the scheme's actuaries in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 published by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries. They are not sums paid or due to the
directors concerned.
(2) The increase in transfer value in the year is stated net of the members' contributions.
In the year to 30 April 2007, Mr Miller deferred $30,000 of his annual salary and $100,000 of his 2005/6 bonus in the Sunbelt deferred compensation plan
and consequently Sunbelt allocated $12,500 by way of its co-match contribution. At 30 April 2007, Mr Miller's account was also credited with the annual
investment return of $32,769. At 30 April 2007 the total gross amount deferred relating to Mr Miller in the plan, including allocated investment return was
$191,784 or  95,897.

The Company's Employee Share Option Trust has conditionally transferred shares to Mr Burnett, Mr Dhaiwal, Mr Drabble and Mr Robson in respect of
substantially all of the options awarded to them under the Company's Investment Incentive Plan and the Performance Share Plan on conditions under
which the shares are automatically returned to the trust in the event that the performance conditions underlying the awards are not achieved.
Following the  152m equity rights issue in August 2006, the interests of all participants in the Company's share-based remuneration plans were adjusted
on a neutral basis for the dilutive effect of the rights issue. This involved uplifting the outstanding awards and option grants by 8.41% and, where
applicable, reducing the exercise price by 7.76% to ensure the option holders maintained the same economic interest in the Company.
Following Mr Burnett's retirement on 31 December 2006, the Committee determined that, in accordance with the rules of the plans, Mr Burnett's IIP and
PSP awards should be released to him as he was a good  leaver and this has occurred subsequently.
