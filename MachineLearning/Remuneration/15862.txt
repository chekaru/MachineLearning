related incentives. A signifi cant proportion of the overall package 
comprises performance related elements.
None of the executive directors hold any outside appointments. 
Basic salary
An executive director's basic salary is normally determined by the 
Committee before the start of the year and when an individual changes 
position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee 
considers the experience and performance of individuals and relationships 
across the board and seeks to be competitive, but fair, using information 
drawn from both internal and external sources and taking account of pay 
and conditions elsewhere in the Company. Refl ecting the current market 
environment and focus on operating costs, salaries for 2009/10 have been 
held at their 2008/9 level. Joe Phelan's salary of $520,000 per annum is 
also slightly lower than the fi nal salary of his predecessor.
Annual performance related bonus plan
Under the annual performance related bonus plan for executive directors, 
payouts for the year to 30 April 2009 were related directly to profi tability 
and cash fl ow and were subject to a cap of 100% of salary. The 
Committee establishes the objectives that must be met for each fi nancial 
year if a cash incentive bonus for that year is to be paid. In determining 
bonus parameters, the Committee's objective is to set targets that refl ect 
appropriately challenging fi nancial performance.
The target for Geoff Drabble and Ian Robson relating to profi tability was 
not achieved but the target relating to cash fl ow was fully achieved. As a 
result they earned 25% of their maximum bonus entitlement for the year. 
The fi nancial targets relevant to Sat Dhaiwal and Cliff Miller were not 
achieved and accordingly they received no bonus. 
For the year to 30 April 2010, executive directors' performance related 
bonuses will be subject to a cap of 100% of salary with 50% of bonus 
potential based on a profi tability target and 50% on a cash fl ow target. 
Share-based incentives
Details of the Company's share-based incentives are set out below.
Previous plans
A. Executive share option plans
Until 2002, it was the Committee's policy to make regular awards under 
the Company's executive share option plans to senior staff. No awards 
have been granted under this plan since February 2002. Shareholder 
approval for this plan had been granted in 1996 and accordingly the plan 
formally lapsed in October 2006.
B.  Investment Incentive Plan
The Committee has not made any awards under this plan since 2004/5 
and the Company does not intend to make further awards under this plan, 
which lapses in 2011.
Current Plan - Performance Share Plan
Under the Performance Share Plan executive directors and other members 
of the senior management team may annually be awarded a conditional 
right to acquire shares ( performance shares') the vesting of which 
depends on the satisfaction of demanding performance conditions. 
Performance conditions are based on Total Shareholder Return ( TSR') 
and/or earnings per share ( EPS').
In recent years, the policy has been to grant awards of shares with a 
market value at the date of grant equal to between 20% and 100% of the 
participant's base salary with the executive directors typically receiving 
the upper end of this range. Following approval of the amendment to the 
Performance Share Plan Rules at the 2008 Annual General Meeting, Geoff 
Drabble's 2008 award was based on 150% of his base salary as at the date 
of grant but the awards for the other executive directors remained at 
100% of base salary.
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 (the  Regulations'). The report also meets the relevant 
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and 
describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance 
relating to directors' remuneration. As required by the Regulations, 
a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting of the Company.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company's members 
on elements of the Directors' Remuneration Report and to state whether, 
in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Accounting Regulations. The report has therefore 
been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee ( the 
Committee') in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined 
Code. The members of the Committee are Gary Iceton (chairman), Hugh 
Etheridge and Michael Burrow. None of the Committee members has any 
personal fi nancial interests, other than as shareholders, in the matters to 
be decided.
The Group's chief executive, Geoff Drabble, normally attends the meetings 
of the Committee to advise on operational aspects of the implementation 
of existing policies and policy proposals, except where his own 
remuneration is concerned, as does the non-executive chairman, Chris 
Cole. The company secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. Under 
Gary Iceton's direction, the company secretary and Geoff Drabble have 
responsibility for ensuring the Committee has the information relevant to 
its deliberations. In formulating its policies, the Committee has access to 
professional advice from outside the Company, as required, and to publicly 
available reports and statistics. External professional advice was obtained 
in the year from Hewitt New Bridge Street (HNBS) which assisted the 
Company with the amendment to the rules of the Company's Performance 
Share Plan which was approved by shareholders at the 2008 Annual 
General Meeting. HNBS did not provide any other services to the Company.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate 
and retain directors of the high calibre needed to achieve the Group's 
objectives and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. 
The main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors 
and senior management are:
basic annual salary and benefi ts in kind;   
annual performance related bonus plan;   
Performance Share Plan awards; and   
pension arrangements.   
In assessing all aspects of pay and benefi ts, the Company compares 
packages offered by similar companies, which are chosen having regard to:
the size of the company (enterprise value, revenues, profi ts and number   
of employees); 
the diversity and complexity of its businesses;   
the geographical spread of its businesses; and   
their growth, expansion and change profi le.   
In making the comparisons, the Company also takes into consideration 
the Group's signifi cant operations in the US where the Company has a 
number of large, successful competitors who compete with it for top 
management talent.
The Committee implements its remuneration policies by the design of 
reward packages for executive directors comprising the appropriate mix 
of salary, performance related annual cash incentive bonuses and share  The performance criteria vary by year of award and are as follows:
    Performance criteria (measured over three years)
Award date Financial year  EPS (% of award) TSR (% of award) Status
17/8/05 2005/6 2007/8 EPS between 7.7p (12.5% vested)  From date of grant versus FTSE 250 Index EPS target met in full and 50% of the
   to 9.1p (50% vested)  (12.5% at median; 50% at upper quartile) award vested. The remaining 50% lapsed
12/10/06 2006/7 2008/9 EPS - 16.2p (12.5% vested) - 19p (100% vested) Lapsed
30/7/07 2007/8 2009/10 EPS - RPI + 4% p.a. (30% vested) - RPI + 10% p.a. (100% vested) Not completed
14/10/08 2008/9 2010/11 EPS - RPI + 0%p.a. (12.5% vested)  From date of grant versus FTSE 250 Index Not completed
   - RPI + 5%p.a. (50% vested) (12.5% median; 50% at upper quartile)
For performance between the lower and upper EPS ranges and, where applicable, also the lower and upper TSR ranges, vesting of the award is scaled 
on a straight-line basis.
EPS for the purpose of the awards was based on the profi t before tax, exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles less a notional 30% tax 
charge for awards made for years up to 2006/7. Thereafter awards have been based on EPS computed using the same profi t defi nition less the actual 
tax charge included in the accounts. The Remuneration Committee considers it most appropriate to measure TSR performance relative to the FTSE 250 
(excluding investment trusts) rather than a specifi c comparator group of companies because there are few direct comparators to the Company listed 
in London and because the Company is a FTSE 250 company.
Following consultation with the Company's major shareholders in 2008, the Committee reintroduced a TSR performance target for its 2008/9 PSP 
awards in addition to an EPS target. Given the cyclical nature of our business the Committee intends to vary the proportion of the performance criteria 
represented by EPS and TSR over the cycle between 50%/50%, 75%/25% and 25%/75%. For the forthcoming 2009/10 PSP awards, the Committee 
intends that vesting will be based as to 75% on TSR and 25% on EPS.
As agreed by the Nomination and Remuneration Committees prior to Joe Phelan joining the Group, Joe's 2009/10 PSP award will be enhanced by 
around 15% ($80,000) above the award of 100% of base salary awarded to other executive directors at his level to compensate him for incentives 
lost when he left his previous employment. 
Shareholding guidelines
Executive directors are required to retain no fewer than 50% of shares 
that vest under the Performance Share Plan (net of taxes) until such 
time as a shareholding equivalent to 100% of salary is achieved and 
thereafter maintained.
Employee Share Ownership Trust
The Group has established an Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) to 
acquire and hold shares in the Company to satisfy potential awards under 
the Performance Share Plan. At 30 April 2009, the ESOT held a benefi cial 
interest in 5,752,818 shares. 
Relative performance
The following graph compares the Company's TSR performance with the 
FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) over the fi ve years ended 
30 April 2009. The FTSE 250 is the Stock Exchange index the Committee 
considers to be the most appropriate to the size and scale of the 
Company's operations.
This graph shows the value, by 30 April 2009, of  100 invested in Ashtead 
Group plc on 30 April 2004 compared with the value of  100 invested in 
the FTSE 250 Index (excluding Investment Trusts). The other points 
plotted are the values at intervening fi nancial year-ends.
Directors' pension arrangements
The Company makes a payment of 40% of his base salary to Geoff Drabble 
in lieu of providing him with any pension arrangements.
Under the terms of his contract, Ian Robson is entitled to retire at age 60 
on a pension equal to one-thirtieth of his fi nal salary for each year of 
pensionable service. His pension is provided through the Company's 
Retirement Benefi ts Plan, which is a defi ned benefi ts scheme. Ian Robson's 
contract also contains early retirement provisions allowing him to retire 
and draw a pension based on actual years of service, but without 
deduction for early payment. This takes effect in May 2010 once he has 
completed 10 years service with the Company (or at any time after age 50 
if there is a change of control). Ian Robson pays contributions equal to 
7.5% of his salary to the Retirement Benefi ts Plan.
Sat Dhaiwal's pension benefi ts are also provided entirely through the 
Ashtead Group plc Retirement Benefi ts Plan. His pension rights accrue at 
the rate of one-sixtieth of salary (as defi ned) for each year of pensionable 
service and his normal retirement date is at age 65. Sat Dhaiwal pays 
contributions equal to 7.5% of his salary to the Retirement Benefi ts Plan.
The Retirement Benefi ts Plan also provides for:
in the event of death in service or death between leaving service and   
retirement while retaining membership of the plan, a spouse's pension 
equal to 50% of the member's deferred pension, calculated at the date 
of death plus a return of his contributions;
in the event of death in retirement, a spouse's pension equal to 50%   
of the member's pension at the date of death;
an option to retire at any time after age 50 with the Company's   
consent. Early retirement benefi ts are reduced by an amount agreed 
between the actuary and the trustees as refl ecting the cost to the plan 
of the early retirement. In 2010, government regulations raise the 
minimum early retirement age to 55; and
pension increases in line with the increase in retail price infl ation up   
to a limit of currently 5% a year in respect of service since 1997.
Joe Phelan receives a payment of 15% of his base salary during his fi rst 
year of employment in lieu of providing him with any pension 
arrangements. This reduces to 14% of base salary thereafter.

Executive directors' service agreements
The service agreements between the Company and Geoff Drabble (dated 6 July 2006), Ian Robson (dated 4 August 2000), Sat Dhaiwal (dated 8 July 2002) 
and between Sunbelt and Joe Phelan (dated 20 April 2009) are all terminable by either party giving the other 12 months' notice. The service agreements 
for each of the executive directors all contain non-compete provisions appropriate to their roles. 
Remuneration policy for non-executive directors
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association. None of the 
non-executive directors has a service contract with the Company and their appointment is therefore terminable by the Board at any time. 
An ordinary resolution concerning the Group's remuneration policies will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Notes:
(1) The transfer values represent the amount which would have been paid to another pension scheme had the director elected to take a transfer of his accrued pension entitlement at that date and have been calculated 
by the scheme's actuaries in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 published by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries. They are not sums paid or due to the directors concerned.
(2)  The increase in transfer value in the year is stated net of the members' contributions. 
Until his departure on 6 April 2009, Cliff Miller deferred $10,271 of his annual salary and $32,813 of his 2007/8 bonus in the Sunbelt deferred 
compensation plan and consequently Sunbelt allocated $25,271 by way of its co-match contribution. During the year, his account was also charged 
with a negative annual investment return of $111,225 and he withdrew $127,685. At 30 April 2009, the outstanding balance in the plan due to Cliff 
was $145,570 or  98,239.

Following the partial vesting of the PSP awards made in 2005, on 1 October 2008, Sat Dhaiwal exercised his entitlement to 60,175 shares and sold 
24,672 shares at 67p per share to settle his tax liability in respect of the exercise. The shares sold by Sat Dhaiwal were acquired by the Company's 
Employee Share Option Trust. Sat Dhaiwal retained the balance of 35,303 shares. 
The performance conditions attaching to the Performance Share Plan referred to above are detailed on pages 41 and 42.
Cash Incentive Scheme
Sat Dhaiwal holds 54,202 units in the Company's Cash Incentive Scheme which were granted to him on 22 February 2000 when he was not a director. 
The performance criteria related to this award have been satisfi ed and accordingly he may exercise the award in whole or in part at any time prior to 
22 February 2010. When the award is exercised Sat will be paid in cash an amount equal to the difference between the mid market price of Ashtead 
Group plc shares on the day of exercise and 94.09p multiplied by the number of units exercised. The resultant sum will be paid to him in cash less 
applicable taxes.
The market price of the Company's shares at the end of the fi nancial year was 63.0p and the highest and lowest closing prices during the fi nancial year 
were 85.0p and 29.3p respectively.
