 directors' remuneration report
Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010
39
Basic salary
An executive director's basic salary is normally determined by the 
Committee before the start of the year and when an individual changes 
position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee 
considers the experience and performance of individuals and relationships 
across the Board and seeks to be competitive, but fair, using information 
drawn from both internal and external sources and taking account of pay 
and conditions elsewhere in the Company. Reflecting the current market 
environment and focus on operating costs, for the second successive year, 
salaries for 2010/11 will be held at their 2008/9 level.
Annual performance related bonus plan
Under the annual performance related bonus plan for executive directors, 
payouts for the year to 30 April 2010 were related directly to profitability 
and cash flow and were subject to a cap of 100% of salary. The Committee 
establishes the objectives that must be met for each financial year if a cash 
incentive bonus for that year is to be paid. In determining bonus parameters, 
the Committee's objective is to set targets that reflect appropriately 
challenging financial performance.
The target for Geoff Drabble and Ian Robson relating to profitability was 
partially achieved while the target relating to cash flow was fully achieved. 
As a result they earned 75% of their maximum bonus entitlement for the 
year. The financial targets relevant to Joe Phelan and Sat Dhaiwal depended 
on Sunbelt's and A-Plant's performance respectively and were also partially 
achieved with the result that they each earned 50% of their maximum bonus.
For the year to 30 April 2011, executive directors' performance related 
bonuses will be subject to a cap of 100% of salary with 50% of bonus 
potential based on profitability targets and 50% on cash generation targets.
Share-based incentives and dilution limits
The Company observes an overall dilution limit of 10% in 10 years for  
all Company share schemes, together with a limit of 5% in 10 years  
for discretionary schemes.
Details of the Company's share-based incentives are set out below.
Previous plans
A. Executive share option schemes
Until 2002, it was the Committee's policy to make regular awards under 
the Company's executive share option plans to senior staff. No awards 
have been granted under this plan since February 2002. Shareholder 
approval for this plan had been granted in 1996 and accordingly the plan 
formally lapsed in October 2006.
B.  Investment Incentive Plan
The Committee has not made any awards under this plan since 2004/5 
and the Company does not intend to make further awards under this plan, 
which lapses in 2011.
Current plan - Performance Share Plan
Under the Performance Share Plan ( PSP') executive directors and other 
members of the senior management team may annually be awarded a 
conditional right to acquire shares ( performance shares') the vesting of 
which depends on the satisfaction of demanding performance conditions. 
Performance conditions are based on Total Shareholder Return ( TSR') 
and/or Earnings Per Share ( EPS').
In recent years, the policy has been to grant awards of shares with a 
market value at the date of grant equal to between 20% and 100% of the 
participant's base salary with the executive directors typically receiving 
the upper end of this range. Following approval of the amendment to the 
Performance Share Plan Rules at the 2008 Annual General Meeting, Geoff 
Drabble's 2009 award was 150% of his base salary as at the date of grant.
As agreed by the Nomination and Remuneration Committees prior to Joe 
Phelan joining the Group, Joe's 2009 PSP award was enhanced by around 
15% ($80,000) above the usual 100% of base salary to compensate him 
for incentives lost when he left his previous employment. The 2009 
awards for the other executive directors were at 100% of base salary.
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the  
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 (the  Regulations'). The report also meets the relevant 
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and 
describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance 
relating to directors' remuneration. As required by the Regulations,  
a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting of the Company.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company's members on 
elements of the Directors' Remuneration Report and to state whether,  
in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Accounting Regulations. The report has therefore 
been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee ( the 
Committee') in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined 
Code. The members of the Committee are Gary Iceton (chairman), Hugh 
Etheridge and Michael Burrow. None of the Committee members has any 
personal financial interests, other than as shareholders, in the matters to 
be decided.
The Group's chief executive, Geoff Drabble, normally attends the  
meetings of the Committee to advise on operational aspects of the 
implementation of existing policies and policy proposals, except where  
his own remuneration is concerned, as does the non-executive chairman, 
Chris Cole. The company secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. 
Under Gary Iceton's direction, the company secretary and Geoff Drabble 
have responsibility for ensuring the Committee has the information 
relevant to its deliberations. In formulating its policies, the Committee  
has access to professional advice from outside the Company, as required, 
and to publicly available reports and statistics. External professional 
advice was obtained in the year from Hewitt New Bridge Street (HNBS) 
with respect to current remuneration trends in FTSE 250 companies.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate  
and retain directors of the high calibre needed to achieve the Group's 
objectives and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders.  
The main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors 
and senior management are:
  basic annual salary and benefits in kind; 
  annual performance related bonus plan;
  Performance Share Plan awards; and
  pension arrangements.
In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, the Company compares 
packages offered by similar companies, which are chosen having regard to:
   the size of the company (enterprise value, revenues, profits and number 
of employees);
   the diversity and complexity of its businesses;
   the geographical spread of its businesses; and
   their growth, expansion and change profile.
In making the comparisons, the Company also takes into consideration 
the Group's significant operations in the US where the Company has a 
number of large, successful competitors who compete with it for top 
management talent.
The Committee implements its remuneration policies by the design  
of reward packages for executive directors comprising the appropriate  
mix of salary, performance related annual cash incentive bonuses and 
share related incentives. A significant proportion of the overall package 
comprises performance related elements.
None of the executive directors hold any outside appointments. The performance criteria vary by year of award and are as follows:
  Performance criteria (measured over three years)
Award date Financial year  EPS (% of award) TSR (% of award) Status
6/10/04 2004/5 2006/7 EPS between 5p (12.5% vested)  From award date versus FTSE Small Cap  Vested in full in October 2007 
   and 8p (50% vested)  (12.5% at median; 50% at upper quartile)
17/8/05 2005/6 2007/8 EPS between 7.7p (12.5% vested)  From date of grant versus FTSE 250 Index  EPS target met in full and 50% of the  
   to 9.1p (50% vested) (12.5% at median; 50% at upper quartile) award vested. The remaining 50% lapsed
12/10/06 2006/7 2008/9 EPS - 16.2p (12.5% vested) - 19p (100% vested) Lapsed
30/7/07 2007/8 2009/10 EPS - RPI + 4% p.a. (30% vested) - RPI + 10% p.a. (100% vested) Lapsed
14/10/08 2008/9 2010/11 EPS - RPI + 0% p.a. (12.5% vested)  From date of grant versus FTSE 250 Index  Not completed 
   - RPI + 5% p.a. (50% vested) (12.5% at median; 50% at upper quartile) 
13/7/09 2009/10 2011/12 EPS - RPI + 0% (25% vested) From date of grant versus FTSE 250 Index  Not completed 
    (37.5% at median; 75% at upper quartile) 
For performance between the lower and upper EPS and TSR ranges, vesting of the award is scaled on a straight-line basis.
EPS for the purpose of the awards was based on the profit before tax, exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles less a notional 30% tax 
charge for awards made for years up to 2006/7. Thereafter awards have been based on EPS computed using the same profit definition less the actual  
tax charge included in the accounts. The Remuneration Committee considers it most appropriate to measure TSR performance relative to the FTSE 250 
(excluding investment trusts) rather than a specific comparator group of companies because there are few direct comparators to the Company listed in 
London and because the Company is a FTSE 250 company.
Following consultation with the Company's major shareholders in 2008, the Committee reintroduced a TSR performance target for its 2008/9 PSP 
awards in addition to an EPS target. Given the cyclical nature of our business the Committee intends to vary the proportion of the performance criteria 
represented by EPS and TSR over the cycle between 50%/50%, 75%/25% and 25%/75%. For the forthcoming 2010/11 PSP awards, the Committee 
intends that vesting will be based 50% on TSR and 50% on EPS.
Shareholding guidelines
Executive directors are required to retain no fewer than 50% of shares 
that vest under the Performance Share Plan (net of taxes) until such  
time as a shareholding equivalent to 100% of salary is achieved and 
thereafter maintained.
Employee Share Ownership Trust
The Group has established an Employee Share Ownership Trust ( ESOT') 
to acquire and hold shares in the Company to satisfy potential awards 
under the Performance Share Plan. At 30 April 2010, the ESOT held a 
beneficial interest in 5,669,844 shares.
Relative performance
The following graph compares the Company's TSR performance with the 
FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) over the five years ended  
30 April 2010. The FTSE 250 is the Stock Exchange index the Committee 
considers to be the most appropriate to the size and scale of the 
Company's operations. 
This graph shows the value, by 30 April 2010, of  100 invested in Ashtead 
plc on 30 April 2005 compared with the value of  100 invested in the FTSE 
250 Index (excluding investment trusts). The other points plotted are the 
values at intervening financial year ends. 
Directors' pension arrangements
The Company makes a payment of 40% of his base salary to Geoff Drabble 
in lieu of providing him with any pension arrangements. This provision was 
agreed prior to his joining the Company in 2006 and reflected the fact that 
he was leaving a generous defined benefit arrangement at his previous 
employer. His retirement, under his contract, is at age 60.
Under the terms of his contract, Ian Robson is entitled to retire at age 60 on 
a pension equal to one-thirtieth of his final salary for each year of pensionable 
service. Ian Robson's contract also contains early retirement provisions 
enabling him to retire at a date of his choosing and draw a pension based  
on actual years of service, but without deduction for early payment. These 
provisions became effective from May 2010 when he completed 10 years' 
service with the Company. Ian Robson pays contributions equal to 7.5%  
of his salary to the Retirement Benefits Plan. Both the accrual rate and  
the early retirement provisions were agreed prior to Mr Robson joining the 
Company in 2000 and reflected the need to be competitive with similar 
arrangements he enjoyed with his previous employer.
Sat Dhaiwal's pension benefits are also provided entirely through the 
Ashtead Group plc Retirement Benefits Plan. His pension rights accrue at 
the rate of one-sixtieth of salary (as defined) for each year of pensionable 
service and his normal retirement date is at age 65. Sat Dhaiwal pays 
contributions equal to 7.5% of his salary to the Retirement Benefits Plan.
The Retirement Benefits Plan also provides for:
   in the event of death in service or death between leaving service and 
retirement while retaining membership of the plan, a spouse's pension 
equal to 50% of the member's deferred pension, calculated at the date 
of death plus a return of his contributions;
   in the event of death in retirement, a spouse's pension equal to 50%  
of the member's pension at the date of death;
   an option to retire at any time after age 55 with the Company's consent. 
Early retirement benefits are reduced by an amount agreed between the 
actuary and the trustees as reflecting the cost to the plan of the early 
retirement; and
   pension increases in line with the increase in retail price inflation up  
to a limit of currently 5% a year in respect of service since 1997.
Joe Phelan received a payment of 15% of his base salary during his  
first year of employment in lieu of providing him with any pension 
arrangements. This was reduced to 14% of base salary thereafter.  
In line with US law no retirement age is specified under Joe's contract.

Executive directors' service agreements
The service agreements between the Company and Geoff Drabble (dated 6 July 2006), Ian Robson (dated 4 August 2000), Sat Dhaiwal (dated 8 July 2002) 
and between Sunbelt and Joe Phelan (dated 20 April 2009) are all terminable by either party giving the other 12 months' notice. The service agreements 
for each of the executive directors all contain non-compete provisions appropriate to their roles.
In accordance with best practice, none of the executive directors' contracts provide for payment of any bonus for the period when notice has been given.
Remuneration policy for non-executive directors
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association. None of the non-executive 
directors has a service contract with the Company and their appointment is therefore terminable by the Board at any time.
An ordinary resolution concerning the Group's remuneration policies will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
