 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the  
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 ( the Regulations'). The report also meets the relevant 
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and 
describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance 
relating to directors' remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a 
resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting of the Company.
The Act requires the auditor to report to the Company's members on 
elements of the Directors' Remuneration Report and to state whether,  
in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Regulations. The report has therefore been divided 
into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee ( the 
Committee') in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined 
Code. The members of the Committee are Michael Burrow (chairman), 
Hugh Etheridge, Bruce Edwards and Ian Sutcliffe. None of the Committee 
members has any personal financial interests, other than as shareholders, 
in the matters to be decided.
The Group's chief executive, Geoff Drabble, normally attends the meetings 
of the Committee to advise on operational aspects of the implementation 
of existing policies and policy proposals, except where his own 
remuneration is concerned, as does the non-executive chairman, Chris 
Cole. The company secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. Under 
Michael Burrow's direction, the company secretary and Geoff Drabble 
have responsibility for ensuring the Committee has the information 
relevant to its deliberations. In formulating its policies, the Committee  
has access to professional advice from outside the Company, as required, 
and to publicly available reports and statistics.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate  
and retain directors of the high calibre needed to achieve the Group's 
objectives and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The 
main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors and 
senior management are:
basic annual salary and benefits in kind;  	
annual performance related bonus plan;  	
Performance Share Plan awards; and  	
pension arrangements.  	
In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, the Company compares 
packages offered by similar companies, which are chosen having regard to:
the size of the company (enterprise value, revenue, profit and number   	
of employees);
the diversity and complexity of its businesses;  	
the geographical spread of its businesses; and  	
their growth, expansion and change profile.  	
In making the comparisons, the Company also takes into consideration 
the Group's significant operations in the US where the Company has a 
number of large, successful competitors who compete with it for top 
management talent.
The Committee implements its remuneration policies by the design of 
reward packages for executive directors comprising the appropriate mix  
of salary, performance related annual cash incentive bonuses and share 
related incentives. A significant proportion of the overall package 
comprises performance related elements.
None of the executive directors hold any outside appointments.
Basic salary
An executive director's basic salary is normally determined by the 
Committee before the start of the year and when an individual changes 
position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee 
considers the experience and performance of individuals and relationships 
across the Board and seeks to be competitive, but fair, using information 
drawn from both internal and external sources and taking account of  
pay and conditions elsewhere in the Company. In November 2010, after  
18 months of pay freezes, the Group implemented a 2% pay increase  
for all staff other than those, including the executive directors, who 
participate in its management incentive or sales commission programmes. 
The Group plans to review pay levels again across the business at the  
end of the first quarter of 2011 taking account not only the Group's 
performance but also the macroeconomic outlook. 
Annual performance related bonus plan
Under the annual performance related bonus plan for executive directors, 
payouts for the year to 30 April 2011 were related directly to profitability 
and cash flow and were subject to a cap of 100% of salary. The 
Committee establishes the objectives that must be met for each financial 
year if a cash incentive bonus for that year is to be paid. In determining 
bonus parameters, the Committee's objective is to set targets that reflect 
appropriately challenging financial performance.
The targets for Geoff Drabble, Brendan Horgan and Ian Robson relating  
to profitability and cash flow were fully achieved. As a result they earned 
their maximum bonus entitlement for the year, equivalent to 100% of 
base salary. The target for Sat Dhaiwal relating to profitability was not 
achieved whilst that relating to cash flow was partially achieved and 
accordingly he earned a bonus of 15% of base salary.
The Company is currently consulting with its major shareholders on  
its proposals for executive directors' remuneration for the year ending  
30 April 2012.
Share-based incentives and dilution limits
The Company observes an overall dilution limit of 10% in 10 years for  
all Company share schemes, together with a limit of 5% in 10 years for 
discretionary schemes.
Details of the Company's share-based incentives are set out below.
Previous plans
Executive share option schemes 
No awards have been granted under this plan since February 2002. 
Shareholder approval for this plan had been granted in 1996 and 
accordingly the plan formally lapsed in October 2006. All awards held by 
executive directors have now vested or lapsed with the final exercises 
under this plan occurring during the past year.
Investment Incentive Plan 
The Committee has not made any awards under this plan since 2004/5 
and the Company does not intend to make further awards under this plan, 
which lapses in October 2011.
Current plan - Performance Share Plan
Under the Performance Share Plan, which was adopted in 2004, executive 
directors and other members of the senior management team may 
annually be awarded a conditional right to acquire shares ( performance 
shares') the vesting of which depends on the satisfaction of demanding 
performance conditions. Performance conditions are based on Total 
Shareholder Return ( TSR') and/or Earnings Per Share ( EPS').
In recent years, the policy has been to grant awards of shares with a 
market value at the date of grant equal to between 20% and 100% of the 
participant's base salary with the executive directors typically receiving 
the upper end of this range and the chief executive receiving an award 
equivalent to 150% of his base salary as at the date of grant.

The performance criteria vary by year of award and are as follows:
Performance criteria (measured over 3 years)
Award date Financial year EPS (% of award) TSR (% of award) Status
6/10/04 2004/5 2006/7 EPS between 5p (12.5% vested) 
and 8p (50% vested)
From award date versus FTSE Small Cap 
(12.5% at median; 50% at upper quartile)
Vested in full in October 2007
17/8/05 2005/6 2007/8 EPS between 7.7p (12.5% vested) 
to 9.1p (50% vested)
From date of grant versus FTSE 250 Index 
(12.5% at median; 50% at upper quartile)
EPS target met in full and 50% of the 
award vested. The remaining 50% lapsed
12/10/06 2006/7 2008/9 EPS - 16.2p (12.5% vested) - 19p (100% vested) Lapsed
30/7/07 2007/8 2009/10 EPS - RPI+4% p.a. (30% vested) - RPI+ 10% p.a. (100% vested) Lapsed
14/10/08 2008/9 2010/11 EPS - RPI + 0% p.a. (12.5% 
vested) - RPI + 5% p.a. (50% vested)
From date of grant versus FTSE 250 Index 
(12.5% at median; 50% at upper quartile)
EPS targets not met and will lapse. TSR not 
completed
13/7/09 2009/10 2011/12 EPS - RPI + 0% (25% vested) From date of grant versus FTSE 250 Index 
(37.5% at median; 75% at upper quartile)
Not completed
29/6/10 2010/11 2012/13 EPS between 1p (12.5% vested) 
and 2.5p (50% vested)
From date of grant versus FTSE 250 Index 
(12.5% at median; 50% at upper quartile)
Not completed
For performance between the lower and upper EPS and TSR ranges, vesting of the award is scaled on a straight-line basis.
EPS for the purpose of the outstanding awards is based on the profit before 
tax, exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles less the tax 
charge included in the accounts. The Remuneration Committee considers it 
most appropriate to measure TSR performance relative to the FTSE 250 
(excluding investment trusts) rather than a specific comparator group of 
companies because there are few direct comparators to the Company 
listed in London and because the Company is a FTSE 250 company.
Given the cyclical nature of our business, the Committee intends to vary 
the proportion of the performance criteria represented by EPS and TSR  
over the cycle between 50%/50%, 75%/25% and 25%/75%. For the 
forthcoming 2011/12 PSP awards, the Committee intends that vesting  
will be based 25% on TSR and 75% on EPS.
Shareholding guidelines
Executive directors are required to retain no fewer than 50% of shares that 
vest under the Performance Share Plan (net of taxes) until such time as a 
shareholding equivalent to 100% of salary is achieved and thereafter 
maintained.
Employee Share Ownership Trust
The Group has established an Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) to 
acquire and hold shares in the Company to satisfy potential awards under 
the Performance Share Plan. At 30 April 2011, the ESOT held a beneficial 
interest in 5,630,628 shares.
Relative performance
The following graph compares the Company's TSR performance with  
the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) over the five years  
ended 30 April 2011. The FTSE 250 is the Stock Exchange index the 
Committee considers to be the most appropriate to the size and scale  
of the Company's operations.

Directors' pension arrangements
The Company makes a payment of 40% of his base salary to Geoff 
Drabble in lieu of providing him with any pension arrangements. This 
provision was agreed prior to his joining the Company in 2006 and 
reflected the fact that he was leaving a generous defined benefit 
arrangement at his previous employer. Geoff is entitled to retire, under  
his contract, on or at any time after his sixtieth birthday.
Under the terms of his contract, Ian Robson is entitled to retire at a  
date of his choosing and draw a pension equal to one-thirtieth of his  
final salary for each year of pensionable service, but without deduction  
for early payment. These provisions became effective from May 2010 
when he completed 10 years' service with the Company. Ian Robson  
made contributions equal to 7.5% of his salary to the Retirement Benefits 
Plan. Both the accrual rate and the early retirement provisions were  
agreed prior to Mr Robson joining the Company in 2000 and reflected  
the need to be competitive with similar arrangements he enjoyed with  
his previous employer. 
In view of recent changes in the taxation of defined benefit pensions, the 
Company and Ian Robson agreed that his contributory membership of the 
defined benefit plan would cease at the end of March 2011 and that the 
Company would, from April 2011, make a payment to him of 40% of base 
salary in lieu of the Company making any further pension contributions. 
Ian Robson retains all his previous rights, including his early retirement 
rights, relating to the pension benefits he accrued up to March 2011.
Sat Dhaiwal's pension benefits are also provided entirely through the 
Ashtead Group plc Retirement Benefits Plan. His pension rights accrue at 
the rate of one-sixtieth of salary for each year of pensionable service and 
his normal retirement date is at age 65. Sat Dhaiwal pays contributions 
equal to 7.5% of his salary to the Retirement Benefits Plan.
The Retirement Benefits Plan also provides for:
in the event of death in service or death between leaving service and  	
retirement while retaining membership of the plan, a spouse's pension 
equal to 50% of the member's deferred pension, calculated at the date 
of death plus a return of his contributions;
in the event of death in retirement, a spouse's pension equal to 50% of  	
the member's pension at the date of death;
an option to retire at any time after age 55 with the Company's  	
consent. Early retirement benefits are reduced by an amount agreed 
between the actuary and the trustees as reflecting the cost to the plan 
of the early retirement; and
pension increases in line with the increase in retail price inflation up to   	
a limit of currently 5% a year in respect of service since 1997.

Brendan Horgan is a member of the Sunbelt 401K defined contribution 
pension plan and deferred compensation plan. During the year, under the 
401K defined contribution pension plan, Sunbelt provided a co-match of 
10% of the employee's contribution on contributions up to 6% of salary. 
In the past year, there was no co-match under the deferred compensation 
plan but Brendan's deferred compensation account is credited annually 
with a deemed  investment return' equivalent to that earned on 
equivalent investments held by members in the 401K plan.
Executive directors' service agreements
The service agreements between the Company and Geoff Drabble (dated 
6 July 2006), Ian Robson (dated 4 August 2000), Sat Dhaiwal (dated 8 July 
2002) and between Sunbelt and Brendan Horgan (dated 25 January 2011) 
are all terminable by either party giving the other 12 months' notice. The 
service agreements for each of the executive directors all contain 
non-compete provisions appropriate to their roles.
Remuneration policy for non-executive directors
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the 
Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association. None of the 
non-executive directors has a service contract with the Company and 
their appointment is therefore terminable by the Board at any time.
An ordinary resolution concerning the Group's remuneration policies will 
be put to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

and have been calculated by the scheme's actuaries in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 published by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries. They are not sums 
paid or due to the directors concerned.
