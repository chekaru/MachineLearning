 Directors' remuneration report
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of 
the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) Regulations 2008 ( the Regulations'). The report 
also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has 
applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors' 
remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to 
approve the report will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting of the Company.
The Act requires the auditor to report to the Company's 
members on elements of the Directors' remuneration report  
and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report  
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting 
Regulations. The report has therefore been divided into  
separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee  
( the Committee') in accordance with the recommendations of 
the Corporate Governance Code. The members of the Committee 
are Michael Burrow (chairman), Hugh Etheridge, Bruce Edwards 
and Ian Sutcliffe. None of the Committee members has any 
personal financial interests, other than as shareholders, in the 
matters to be decided.
The Group's chief executive, Geoff Drabble, normally attends  
the meetings of the Committee to advise on operational aspects 
of the implementation of existing policies and policy proposals, 
except where his own remuneration is concerned, as does the 
non-executive chairman, Chris Cole. The company secretary 
acts as secretary to the Committee. Under Michael Burrow's 
direction, the company secretary and Geoff Drabble have 
responsibility for ensuring the Committee has the information 
relevant to its deliberations. In formulating its policies, the 
Committee has access to professional advice from outside  
the Company, as required, and to publicly available reports  
and statistics.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, 
motivate and retain directors of the high calibre needed to 
achieve the Group's objectives and to reward them for enhancing 
value to shareholders. The main elements of the remuneration 
package for executive directors and senior management are:
  basic annual salary and benefits in kind; 
  performance related bonus plans;
  Performance Share Plan awards; and
  pension arrangements.
In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, the Company 
compares packages offered by similar companies which are 
chosen having regard to:
  the size of the company (enterprise value, revenue,  
profit and number of employees);
  the diversity and complexity of its businesses;
  the geographical spread of its businesses; and
  their growth, expansion and change profile.
In making the comparisons, the Company also takes into 
consideration the Group's significant operations in the US where 
the Company has a number of large, successful competitors  
who compete with it for top management talent.
The Committee implements its remuneration policies by the 
design of reward packages for executive directors comprising 
the appropriate mix of salary, performance related cash bonuses 
and share related incentives. A significant proportion of the 
overall package comprises performance related elements.
None of the executive directors hold any outside appointments.
Basic salary
An executive director's basic salary is normally determined  
by the Committee in October and when an individual changes 
position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the 
Committee considers the experience and performance of 
individuals and relationships across the Board and seeks to be 
competitive, but fair, using information drawn from both internal 
and external sources and taking account of pay and conditions 
elsewhere in the Company. In November 2011, the Group 
implemented a pay increase of 2 - 5% for its Sunbelt and Group 
employees. Geoff Drabble and Ian Robson received a salary 
increase of 4% of base salary, whilst Brendan Horgan (whose 
salary had only recently been set on appointment in January 
2011) did not receive an increase. In A-Plant non-bonused staff 
were incentivised by a payment equal to 2% of base salary,  
paid in December but Sat Dhaiwal, in line with other members  
of A-Plant's management team, did not receive an increase.
Performance related bonus plans
The Deferred Bonus Plan
Recognising the significant growth opportunities for its business 
in North America and following consultation with its major 
shareholders the Company introduced the Deferred Bonus Plan 
( the DBP') with effect from 1 May 2011.
The DBP, which will run for consecutive three-year periods,  
gives certain key members of the senior management teams of 
Sunbelt Rentals and Ashtead the opportunity to earn an annual 
bonus of up to 150% of base salary (apart from the Group chief 
executive whose maximum opportunity is 200%) for maximum 
performance, with a significant proportion of any earned bonus 
being compulsorily deferred into share equivalents. No bonus  
is earned under the DBP until a threshold level of performance, 
set by the Committee, has been achieved.
Under the rules of the DBP, upon satisfactory attainment of  
the annual performance targets, participants will receive  
a payment in cash (or shares at the option of the Company)  
equal to two-thirds of the combined total of their earned bonus 
for the current year and the value of any share equivalent  
awards brought forward from the previous year at the current 
share price. The other one-third will be compulsorily deferred 
into a new award of share equivalents evaluated at the then 
current share price. For the Group chief executive, whose 
maximum bonus opportunity is greater, only 50% of the total  
will be paid in cash (or shares at the option of the Company)  
with the other 50% being compulsorily deferred into a new  
award of share equivalents.
The deferred share equivalents are subject to 50% forfeiture  
for each subsequent year of the plan period where performance 
falls below the forfeiture threshold set for that year by  
the Committee.
Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 40 At the expiration of each three-year period executive directors 
will, subject to the satisfactory attainment of the performance 
conditions for that year, receive in cash their bonus for that year 
plus any brought forward deferred equivalent at its then current 
value (i.e. there is no further deferral at the end of the third year).
The performance targets for Geoff Drabble and Brendan Horgan 
for the year to 30 April 2012 related directly to the pre-tax profits 
of Ashtead Group and Sunbelt Rentals. For the full year the 
pre-tax profit was  131m for Ashtead Group and $290m for 
Sunbelt Rentals. The targets set by the Committee for full 
entitlement under the DBP were pre-tax profits of  72m for the 
Group and $230m for Sunbelt Rentals. The Group target was 
significantly ahead of both prior year ( 31m) and consensus 
expectation of  52m when the target was set. The target for 
Sunbelt Rentals was significantly ahead of the prior year 
($162m). As a result the maximum bonus entitlements were 
earned and were equivalent to 200% of base salary for Geoff 
Drabble and 150% of base salary for Brendan Horgan with 
one-half and one-third respectively, being compulsorily  
deferred into share equivalents. In accordance with the plan 
rules the deferred share equivalent awards granted to each  
plan participant for 2011/12 have been calculated using the  
share price on 20 June 2012, the date the Group's full year 
results were approved.
In 2013 Geoff Drabble, Suzanne Wood (who will join the Board  
as finance director when Ian Robson retires in July 2012) and 
Brendan Horgan will participate in the DBP. The targets for Geoff 
Drabble and Suzanne Wood will be linked to the Group's pre-tax 
profits and those for Brendan Horgan will relate to Sunbelt's 
operating profit. These performance targets should be viewed  
in conjunction with the wider performance targets set for the 
2012/13 PSP awards as detailed on page 42.
Annual bonus plan
Following the announcement in July 2011 of his retirement in 
July 2012 Ian Robson did not participate in the DBP for 2011/12 
but continued to participate in the Company's traditional annual 
bonus scheme. Ian Robson's maximum bonus entitlement was 
100% of base salary and related directly to the profitability of the 
Group. The stretch target set by the Committee was significantly 
exceeded and therefore Ian Robson earned his maximum  
bonus entitlement.
As a result of the different remuneration environment applicable 
to operational directors in the UK plant hire industry, the 
Committee also considered it appropriate for Sat Dhaiwal to 
continue to participate in the Company's traditional annual bonus 
scheme and not the DBP. The maximum bonus entitlement for 
Sat Dhaiwal was 100% of base salary and related directly to the 
profitability of A-Plant and was partially achieved. Accordingly  
he earned a bonus equivalent to 45% of base salary. 
Share-based incentives and dilution limits
The Company observes an overall dilution limit of 10% in 10 years 
for all Company share schemes, together with a limit of 5% in  
10 years for discretionary schemes. No new shares have been 
issued by the Company in connection with executive share plans 
in recent years.
The Performance Share Plan, which was adopted in 2004, is  
a long-term incentive share award plan under which executive 
directors and other members of the senior management team 
may annually be awarded a conditional right to acquire shares 
( performance shares') the vesting of which depends on the 
satisfaction of demanding performance conditions.
In recent years, the policy has been to grant awards of shares 
with a market value at the date of grant equal to between 20% 
and 100% of the participant's base salary with the executive 
directors typically receiving the upper end of this range and  
the chief executive receiving an award equivalent to 150% of  
his base salary as at the date of grant.
The performance criteria vary by year of award and are as follows:
Performance criteria (measured over three years)
Award date Financial year EPS (% of award) TSR (% of award) Status

For performance between the lower and upper EPS and TSR ranges, vesting of the award is scaled on a straight-line basis.
Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 41 Directors' remuneration report
EPS for the purpose of the outstanding awards is based on the 
profit before tax, exceptional items, fair value remeasurements 
and amortisation of acquired intangibles less the tax charge 
included in the accounts. The Remuneration Committee 
considers it most appropriate to measure TSR performance 
relative to the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts) rather 
than a specific comparator group of companies because there 
are few direct comparators to the Company listed in London  
and because the Company is a FTSE 250 company.
Following consultation with the Company's major shareholders, 
the Committee has determined that the performance criteria  
for the 2012/13 PSP award will be TSR (40%), RoI (25%), EPS 
(25%) and leverage (10%). The Committee intends to adopt a 
similar balanced scorecard approach for future PSP awards 
beyond 2012/13.
Shareholding guidelines
Executive directors are required to retain no fewer than 50% of 
shares that vest under the Performance Share Plan (net of taxes) 
until such time as a shareholding equivalent to 100% of salary  
is achieved and thereafter maintained. All executive directors 
currently meet this guideline.
Employee Share Ownership Trust
The Group has established an Employee Share Ownership Trust 
( ESOT') to acquire and hold shares in the Company to satisfy 
potential awards under the Performance Share Plan. At 30 April 
2012, the ESOT held a beneficial interest in 4,582,462 shares.
Relative performance
The following graph compares the Company's TSR performance 
with the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) over  
the five years ended 30 April 2012. The FTSE 250 is the Stock 
Exchange index the Committee considers to be the most 
appropriate to the size and scale of the Company's operations.

Directors' pension arrangements
The Company makes a payment of 40% to Geoff Drabble's base 
salary in lieu of providing him with any pension arrangements. 
This was agreed prior to his joining the Company in 2006 and 
reflected the fact that he was leaving a generous defined benefit 
arrangement at his previous employer. Geoff is entitled to retire, 
under his contract, on or at any time after his sixtieth birthday.
Under the terms of his contract, Ian Robson is entitled to draw  
a pension equal to one-thirtieth of his final salary for each year  
of pensionable service, but without deduction for early payment, 
on retirement on 13 July 2012. Both the accrual rate and the  
early retirement provisions were agreed prior to his joining the 
Company in 2000 and reflected the need to be competitive with 
similar arrangements he enjoyed with his previous employer. 
Following changes in the taxation of defined benefit pensions,  
the Company and Ian Robson agreed that his contributory 
membership of the defined benefit plan would cease at the end  
of March 2011 and that the Company would, from April 2011, 
make a payment to him of 40% of base salary in lieu of the 
Company making any further pension provision for service after 
that date. Ian retains all his previous rights accrued up to March 
2011. Pursuant to his contract, following his retirement, he will 
receive a retirement allowance of  118,000 per annum from the 
Company from 14 July 2012 until he attains age 55. Thereafter, 
his pension obligation will be met by the Ashtead Group plc 
Retirement Benefits Plan.
Sat Dhaiwal's pension benefits are provided entirely through the 
Retirement Benefits Plan. His pension rights accrue at the rate 
of one-sixtieth of salary for each year of pensionable service  
and his normal retirement date is at age 65. Sat Dhaiwal pays 
contributions equal to 7.5% of his salary to the Retirement 
Benefits Plan.
The Retirement Benefits Plan also provides for:
  in the event of death in service or death between leaving 
service and retirement while retaining membership of the 
plan, a spouse's pension equal to 50% of the member's 
deferred pension, calculated at the date of death plus a  
return of his contributions;
  in the event of death in retirement, a spouse's pension equal  
to 50% of the member's pension at the date of death;
  an option to retire at any time after age 55 with the Company's 
consent. Early retirement benefits are reduced by an amount 
agreed between the actuary and the trustees as reflecting  
the cost to the plan of the early retirement; and
  pension increases in line with the increase in retail price 
inflation up to a limit of currently 5% a year in respect of 
service since 1997.
Brendan Horgan is a member of the Sunbelt 401K defined 
contribution pension plan and the 409A deferred compensation 
plan. He is entitled to a company co-match conditional on 
contributing into the 401K plan or deferring into the 409A plan  
6% of his salary. The co-match is effected either by a company 
payment into the 401K plan or an enhanced deferral into the 409A 
plan pro-rata to how he chooses to make his 6% contribution  
and was $19,000 (4% of salary) in 2011/12.
Executive directors' service agreements
The service agreements between the Company and Geoff 
Drabble (dated 6 July 2006) and Sat Dhaiwal (dated 8 July 2002) 
and between Sunbelt and Brendan Horgan (dated 25 January 
2011) are all terminable by either party giving the other  
12 months' notice. In accordance with Ian Robson's service 
agreement dated 4 August 2000, he gave the Company notice  
in July 2011 of his intention to retire in July 2012. The service 
agreements for each of the executive directors all contain 
non-compete provisions appropriate to their roles.
Remuneration policy for non-executive directors
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined 
by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association. 
None of the non-executive directors has a service contract with 
the Company and their appointment is therefore terminable by 
the Board at any time.
An ordinary resolution concerning the Group's remuneration 
policies will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting.

earned by Geoff Drabble was  948,480 and by Brendan Horgan was  423,700.
iv  In accordance with the terms and conditions of his service contract and the Company having received an executed severance and release agreement and conditional

and certain benefits for a period of 12 months from the termination of his employment in January 2011. Accordingly, although provided in the 2010/11 financial 
statements, he was paid  275,000 in salary and pension contributions and received benefits with a value of  2,000 in the year ended 30 April 2012. In accordance 
with the rules of the plan, he remains a participant in the Performance Share Plan in respect of previous awards on a pro-rata basis up to his date of departure.

Notes:
(1)  The transfer value has been calculated in accordance with regulation 7 to 7E of the Occupational Pension Schemes (transfer values) Regulations 1996 (b). 
The transfer value basis used is that in force at 30 April 2011 and at 30 April 2012 for the calculations as at 30 April 2011 and 30 April 2012 respectively, for the 
Ashtead Group plc Retirement Benefits Plan.
(2) The increase in transfer value in the year is stated net of the members' contributions. 
The increase in the transfer value for Ian Robson reflects his decision to exercise his right to retire in July 2012, such that his pension 
will become payable from the age of 55 rather than his contracted normal retirement date of age 60. 
At 30 April 2012, the total amount available to Brendan Horgan but deferred under the Sunbelt deferred compensation plan was 
$203,037 or  125,092. This includes an allocated negative investment return of $17,970 or  11,280 (2011: gain of  4,667).

During the three-year plan period, the brought forward number of share equivalent awards will be adjusted to the extent that there  
is either an additional grant or forfeiture and, of the resulting balance at the end of the year, either half in the case of Geoff Drabble or 
two-thirds in the case of Brendan Horgan will be released to the executive. At the end of the plan period, the remaining balance after 
any forteiture will be released to the executive.
