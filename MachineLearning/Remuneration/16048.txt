Directors' remuneration 
The Board recognises that Directors' remuneration is of legitimate concern to shareholders and is committed to 
following current best practice. The Group operates within a competitive environment and its performance 
depends on the individual contributions of the Directors and employees. It believes in rewarding vision and 
innovation. The Board has decided to present this remuneration report for shareholder approval so that the 
shareholders can approve the policy set out in this report.  
 
Policy on Executive Directors' remuneration 
The policy of the Board is to provide an executive remuneration package designed to attract, motivate and retain 
Directors of the calibre necessary to maintain the Group's position and to reward them for enhancing shareholder 
value and return. It aims to provide sufficient levels of remuneration to do this but to avoid paying more than is 
necessary. The remuneration should also reflect the Directors' responsibilities and include incentives to deliver 
the Company's objectives. The notice period for termination of the Executive Director's service contract is 12 
months. 
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for making recommendations to the Board on the Company's 
general policy on executive remuneration and also specific packages for individual Directors. It carries out the 
policy on behalf of the Board. 
The membership of the Committee is as follows: 
  David Lees (Chairman); and 
  Keith Lassman. 
David Lees and Keith Lassman are independent Non-Executive Directors. Neither of them have any personal 
financial interest in the matters to be decided (other than as shareholders, share option holders and those 
disclosed in note 18 to the financial statements), potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships nor 
any day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
The Committee meets as required to determine executive remuneration policy. 
 
Main elements of executive remuneration 
There are four main elements of the Executive Director's remuneration package: 
i. fees; 
ii. annual bonus payments; 
iii. share-based payments; and 
iv. pension contributions. 
 
Fees 
The Executive Director's basic salary is reviewed by the Committee. In deciding upon appropriate levels of 
remuneration, the Committee believes that the Group should offer average levels of base pay reflecting individual 
responsibilities compared to similar jobs in comparable companies, as well as internal factors such as 
performance. 
 
Annual bonus payments 
The Committee establishes the objectives which must be met for a bonus to be paid. A performance related 
award scheme incorporating audited earnings per share, share price performance and Group profitability has 
been established which recognises the success of the business for which the Executive Director is responsible. 
Bonus payments are non-pensionable. 
 
Share-based payments 
The interests of Directors in the Company's share options and shares are detailed in notes 4 and 18 to the 
financial statements. 
 
Pension contributions 
All pension entitlements for the Directors are disclosed in note 4 to the financial statements. 
 
Non-Executive Directors 
The Board as a whole determines the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors.  
Non-Executive Directors do not have contracts of service but letters of appointment.   report on remuneration
