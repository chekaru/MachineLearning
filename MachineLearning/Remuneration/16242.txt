directors' Remuneration
REmuNERATION COmmITTEE
The members of the Remuneration Committee are
Peter Williams (Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee) and lord Waheed Alli. The Chief Executive
O cer of the Company is also invited to attend the
meetings of the Remuneration Committee but is
absent when his remuneration is under discussion.
ROLE OF THE REmuNERATION COmmITTEE
The Remuneration Committee reviews and determines
on behalf of the Board and shareholders of the
Company the pay, benefits and other terms of service
of the executive directors of the Company and the
broad pay strategy with respect to senior Company
employees.
BEST PRACTICE
As the Company is AIM-listed it is not legally required
to set out its remuneration policy but is doing so on a
voluntary basis. To the extent that such principles are
relevant to the current circumstances of the Company,
the provisions of inter alia the Directors' Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002 and the Combined Code are
taken into account.
REmuNERATION POLICy
The objective of the Company's remuneration policy is
to attract and retain the directors and senior
executives needed to run the Company in a cost-
e ective manner.
The remuneration policy of the Company has four
principal components:
1. Basic salaries   Basic salaries are determined by
the Remuneration Committee bearing in mind the
salaries paid in AIM-listed and other small market
capitalisation retail companies. Within that frame
of reference, it is intended that pay should be at
or near the median level.
2. Bonuses   Bonuses are payable according to
the achievement by the Company of certain pre-
determined profit before tax targets. The level of
bonuses payable on achievement of the targets
is set at the level perceived correct to provide the
necessary incentives for executive directors. 
3. Performance Share Plan   The Company
established a performance share plan in 2006 for
the executive directors and senior employees.
The scheme is overseen by the Remuneration
Committee which shall determine the terms
under which eligible individuals may be invited to
participate. 26 ASOS PLC ANNuAL REPORT ANd ACCOuNTS 2008 Stock Exchange Code: ASC

4. Share option scheme   The Company has in
place a share option scheme covering senior
employees, under which share options are
normally granted once a year. The exercise price
of the options granted under the scheme is set
equal to the market value of the Company's
shares at the time of grant. The share option
scheme is overseen by the Remuneration
Committee which shall determine the terms
under which eligible individuals may be invited to
participate. It is intended that the scheme should
be an approved scheme but may be unapproved
in relation to certain individuals.
