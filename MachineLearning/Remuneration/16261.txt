REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The members of the Remuneration Committee are Peter 
Williams (Chairman of the Remuneration Committee) 
and Lord Waheed Alli. The Chief Executive Officer of 
the Company is also invited to attend the meetings of 
the Remuneration Committee but is absent when his 
remuneration is under discussion.
ROLE OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee reviews and determines on 
behalf of the Board and shareholders of the Company the 
pay, benefits and other terms of service of the executive 
directors of the Company and the broad pay strategy with 
respect to senior Company employees. During the year, 
the Remuneration Committee received advice on executive 
remuneration from Hewitt New Bridge Street.
BEST PRACTICE
As the Company is AIM-listed it is not legally required to set 
out its remuneration policy but is doing so on a voluntary 
basis. To the extent that such principles are relevant to the 
current circumstances of the Company, the provisions of 
inter alia the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 
2002 and the Combined Code are taken into account.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The objective of the Company's remuneration policy is 
to attract and retain the directors and senior executives 
needed to run the Company in a cost-effective manner.
The remuneration policy of the Company has six principal 
components:
1. Basic salaries   Basic salaries are determined by the 
Remuneration Committee bearing in mind the salaries 
paid in AIM-listed and other small market capitalisation 
retail companies. Within that frame of reference, it is 
intended that pay should be at or near the median level.
2. Pensions   defined contribution pension provision of 
15% of salary is offered to the executive Directors.
3. Bonuses   Bonuses are payable according to 
the achievement by the Company of certain pre-
determined profit before tax targets. The level of 
bonuses payable on achievement of the targets is set 
at the level perceived correct to provide the necessary 
incentives for executive directors. 
4. Performance Share Plan   The Company established 
a performance share plan in 2006 for the executive 
directors and senior employees. The scheme is 
overseen by the Remuneration Committee which shall 
determine the terms under which eligible individuals 
may be invited to participate.
5. Share option scheme   The Company has in place 
a share option scheme covering senior employees, 
under which share options are normally granted once 
a year. The exercise price of the options granted 
under the scheme is set equal to the market value of 
the Company's shares at the time of grant. The share 
option scheme is overseen by the Remuneration 
Committee. There is currently no intention to make any 
new share option grants under this scheme.

6. Management Incentive Plan   The Company will 
establish a new management incentive plan during 
2009 which the Remuneration Committee will 
oversee and determine the terms under which eligible 
individuals may be invited to participate. Participants 
in this scheme will not be granted an award of shares 
under the Performance Share Plan in the year in which 
they have received an award under the Management 
Incentive Plan. Members will be required to invest their 
own money, based on a multiple of gross salary, to buy 
shares in the Company (investment shares). Options 
will then be granted over shares (incentive shares). The 
number of incentive shares will be defined as a multiple 
of investment shares, dependent on performance 
against stretching Earnings per Share (EPS ) and 
Total Shareholders Return (TSR ) performance criteria 
and subject to a maximum. For the 2009 awards, the 
TSR performance condition relates to the Company's 
performance measured against a notional investment 
in all of the companies in the FTSE All Share General 
Retailers index over the three year period commencing 
1 April 2009.
