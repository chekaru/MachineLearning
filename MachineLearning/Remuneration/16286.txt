Directors' r emuneration r eport
As the Company is AIM-listed it is not legally required to set out its 
remuneration policy but is doing so on a voluntary basis. To the extent 
that such principles are relevant to the current circumstances of the 
Company, the provisions of inter alia the Directors' Remuneration 
Report Regulations 2008 and the Combined Code are taken into 
account. As defined by AIM Rule 19, the Company has disclosed the 
remuneration received by its directors during the financial year. 
remuneration policy 
The Company's remuneration policy aims to encourage a performance-
based culture, attract and retain high calibre executive directors and 
align executive directors' and shareholders' interests. In determining 
such policy the Remuneration Committee take into account all 
factors which it deems necessary, including the Company's wider 
pay structures. The objective of the policy is to ensure that executive 
management are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage 
enhanced long-term performance and are, in a fair and responsible 
manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of 
the Company.
The remuneration policy of the Company has a number of principal 
components:
Salary and benefits
Basic salaries are determined by the Remuneration Committee bearing 
in mind the salaries paid in AIM-listed and other retail companies. 
Within that frame of reference, it is intended that pay should be at 
or near the median. The Company operates a defined contribution 
pension scheme, with the Company contributing up to 15% of basic 
salary for executive directors. Executive directors also receive taxable 
benefits including private medical and dental insurance.
Annual Bonus Plan
The annual grant of bonuses is conditional upon the achievement of 
targets by reference to agreed financial performance measures, namely 
profit before tax. This scheme is applicable to executive directors and 
amounts received are detailed in the Directors' Remuneration section of 
this report. Non-executive directors do not participate in any bonus plans.
Long-term Incentive and Share Option plans
The Company believes that employee share ownership strengthens the 
link between their personal interests and those of the shareholders.
Management incentive Plan
During the year, the Company implemented the Management Incentive 
Plan as stated in the 2009 Annual Report and Accounts. Under the 
terms of the Management Incentive Plan (MIP ), executive directors 
and certain senior employees have been given the opportunity to 
invest their own money to buy new subordinated shares issued in a 
subsidiary company, ASOS.com Limited (the Subsidiary ).
The MIP has a three year performance period ending on 31 March 
2012. At the end of the performance period, the subordinated ordinary 
shares will be exchanged for shares in the Company in a ratio to 
be determined by the performance conditions detailed below. The 
exchange will take place in two equal tranches, on 30 September 2012 
and 30 September 2013. 
 
The ratio of shares in the Company which may be exchanged for 
shares in the Subsidiary will depend on performance under the plan 
against interdependent growth in earnings per share (EPS ) and total 
shareholder return (TSR ) targets and will be subject to a maximum. 
As a result of this cap, the maximum dilution to existing shareholders 
will be limited to 5.8%, based on an issued share capital of 74,740,241 
ordinary shares as at 29 January 2010.   Asos PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2010

Under the EPS performance target, the threshold performance  
level will not be met unless the compound rate of growth in fully 
diluted earnings per share (before exceptional items) equals  
24% per annum over the three years ending 31 March 2012.  
The maximum performance level will only be met if the compound 
rate of growth in fully diluted earnings per share (before exceptional 
items) equals or exceeds 30% per annum over the same time period. 
There is also a super-maximum performance level, in which only the 
executive directors will participate. This level will only be met if the 
compound rate of growth in fully diluted earnings per share (before 
exceptional items) equals or exceeds 42% per annum over the same 
time period. 
The TSR Condition requires the comparison of the TSR on an 
investment in the Company with the TSR on a notional investment 
in all of the companies in the FTSE All Share General Retailers Index 
(the Index ) during the Performance Period, as constituted at the 
commencement of the Performance Period. Threshold performance 
will require that the Company TSR is in the fifth decile relative to the 
Index. If Threshold Performance is met, 50% of the award under the 
EPS Condition will vest. Maximum performance will require that the 
ASOS TSR is in the top of first decile relative to the Index. If maximum 
performance is met, 100% of the award under the EPS Condition will 
vest. Awards will vest on a straight-line basis between the fifth decile 
and first decile. If the Company TSR is below the fifth decile relative to 
the Index, no award will vest, irrespective of performance against the 
EPS targets. The Remuneration Committee must also be satisfied that 
there has been an improvement in the underlying financial performance 
of the Company in determining the level of vesting in respect of both the 
EPS Condition and the TSR Condition. 
 
Performance Share Plan
Under the rules of the ASOS Performance Share Plan (PSP ), 
employees may be awarded each year conditional entitlements to 
shares in the Company. Following the introduction of the MIP , no 
participant in the MIP is entitled to be granted any further options 
under the PSP . 
The performance target for options granted in any financial year 
is measured over a three year period. The performance targets for 
options currently granted under the scheme are:
 Annual compound basic 
 EPS growth of the company  v esting percentage of the
 over the performance period shares subject to an award 
 Less than RPI + 10% 0% 
 Equal to RPI + 10% 25% 
 Greater than or equal to RPI + 30% 100% 
 Between RPI + 10%  Between 25% and 100%
 and RPI + 30% pro rata on a straight-line basis 
 
The Remuneration Committee may amend the performance conditions 
applying to existing awards at any given time if an event occurs 
which causes the Committee to consider it appropriate to amend 
them, provided that, in the opinion of the Committee, the amended 
conditions are not materially less challenging to achieve in the 
changed circumstances than those originally set.

The Remuneration Committee will review the performance conditions 
each time new awards are granted and may impose different 
performance conditions for subsequent awards, provided that, in 
the opinion of the Committee, the different performance conditions 
are not materially less challenging in light of the Company's 
circumstances than those set for the initial awards.
EMi Share Option Scheme
The EMI Share Option Scheme is a historical scheme, with final 
options being granted under the scheme during the year ended 
31 March 2009. The scheme awarded share options to executive 
directors and senior executives with vesting periods of between 
one and three years. Options granted under the EMI Share Option 
Scheme have no performance conditions attached and were only 
dependent on continued employment. The exercise price of the 
options granted under the scheme is set equal to the market value of 
the Company's shares at the time of grant.
SAYE Scheme
ASOS introduced an HM Revenue & Customs Approved Save-As-
You-Earn share option scheme (the SAYE Scheme ) on 1 July 2008. 
The scheme is open to all employees who have completed one 
year's service and who enter an approved savings contract for a term 
of three years. Under the rules of the scheme eligible employees 
can contribute between  50 and  250 a month. On maturity, the 
employee has the option to buy shares in the Company up to the 
total savings at the end of the term at the market value less a 20% 
discount at the date of grant. In common with most schemes of this 
type, there are no performance conditions applicable to options 
granted under the SAYE Scheme.
employee benefit trust
The ASOS.com Limited Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) is used to 
facilitate the acquisition of ordinary shares in the Company for 
the purpose of satisfying awards and options granted under the 
Company's share schemes. The Trust is a discretionary trust, the 
sole beneficiaries being employees (including executive directors) 
and former employees of the Group and their close relations. The 
Trustee is Ogier Employee Benefit Trustee Limited, an independent 
professional trustee company based in Jersey. It is the Company's 
intention to use the ordinary shares in the Trust to satisfy certain 
outstanding awards and options made under the Company's 
executive share schemes.
As at 31 March 2010 the EBT held 1,437,305 shares in ASOS PLC 
(2009: 1,450,052) to the value of  3,197,000 (2009:  2,872,000). The 
Group's accounting policy is detailed within note 1 of the Financial 
Statements and movements are detailed in the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity on page 61.
Directors' service contracts
All executive directors are employed under service contracts. The 
services of all executive directors may be terminated by the provision 
of a maximum of 12 months' notice by the Company and the 
individual. Services of non-executive directors may be terminated by 
the provision of a maximum of 3 months' notice by the Company and 
the individual.
