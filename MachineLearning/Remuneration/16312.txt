As the Company is AIM-listed it is not legally required to set out its 
remuneration policy but does so on a voluntary basis. To the extent 
that such principles are relevant to the current circumstances of the 
Company, the provisions of, inter alia, the Directors' Remuneration 
Report Regulations 2008 and the Combined Code are taken into 
account. As defined by AIM Rule 19, the Company has disclosed the 
remuneration received by its directors during the financial year. 
remuneration Policy 
The Company's remuneration policy aims to encourage a performance-
based culture, attract and retain high calibre executive directors and 
align executive directors' and shareholders' interests. In determining 
such policy the Remuneration Committee take into account all factors 
which it deems necessary, including the Company's wider pay structures. 
The objective of the policy is to ensure that executive management are 
provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced long-term 
performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for 
their individual contributions to the success of the Company.
The remuneration policy of the Company has a number of principal 
components:
salary and benefits
Basic salaries are determined by the Remuneration Committee bearing in 
mind the salaries paid in FTSE-listed and other retail companies. Within 
that frame of reference, it is intended that pay should be at or near the 
median. The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme, 
with the Company contributing up to 15% of basic salary for executive 
directors. Executive directors also receive taxable benefits including 
private medical and dental insurance.
Annual Bonus Plan
The annual grant of bonuses is conditional upon the achievement of 
targets by reference to agreed financial performance measures, namely 
profit before tax and exceptional items, and personal performance 
objectives. This scheme is applicable to executive directors and amounts 
received are detailed in the Directors' Remuneration section of this 
report. Non-executive directors do not participate in any bonus plans. 
All other employees of the Company participate in an annual bonus plan 
based on the same principles as the executive directors' bonus scheme.
long-term incentive and share Option Plans
The Company believes that employee share ownership strengthens the 
link between their personal interests and those of the shareholders.
Management Incentive Plan
During 2010, the Company implemented the Management Incentive 
Plan (MIP ). Under the terms of the MIP, executive directors and certain 
senior employees have been given the opportunity to invest their own 
money to buy new subordinated shares issued in a subsidiary company, 
ASOS.com Limited (the Subsidiary ).
The MIP has a three year performance period ending on 31 March 2012.  
At the end of the performance period, the subordinated ordinary shares will 
be exchanged for shares in the Company in a ratio to be determined by the 
performance conditions detailed below. The exchange will take place in two 
equal tranches, on 30 September 2012 and 30 September 2013.

Our Governance
The ratio of shares in the Company which may be exchanged for 
shares in the Subsidiary will depend on performance under the plan 
against interdependent growth in earnings per share (EPS ) and total 
shareholder return (TSR ) targets and will be subject to a maximum. 
As a result of this cap, the maximum dilution to existing shareholders 
will be limited to 5.8%, based on an issued share capital of 74,740,241 
ordinary shares as at 29 January 2010.  
 
Under the EPS performance target, the threshold performance level will 
not be met unless the compound rate of growth in fully diluted earnings 
per share (before exceptional items) equals 24% per annum over the 
three years ending 31 March 2012. The maximum performance level 
will only be met if the compound rate of growth in fully diluted earnings 
per share (before exceptional items) equals or exceeds 30% per annum 
over the same time period. There is also a super-maximum performance 
level, in which only the executive directors will participate. This level will 
only be met if the compound rate of growth in fully diluted earnings per 
share (before exceptional items) equals or exceeds 42% per annum over 
the same time period. 
The TSR Condition requires the comparison of the TSR on an investment 
in the Company with the TSR on a notional investment in all of the 
companies in the FTSE All Share General Retailers Index (the Index ) 
during the Performance Period, as constituted at the commencement 
of the Performance Period. Threshold performance will require that the 
Company TSR is in the fifth decile relative to the Index. If Threshold 
Performance is met, 50% of the award under the EPS Condition will 
vest. Maximum performance will require that the ASOS TSR is in the 
top of first decile relative to the Index. If maximum performance is met, 
100% of the award under the EPS Condition will vest. Awards will vest 
on a straight-line basis between the fifth decile and first decile. If the 
Company TSR is below the fifth decile relative to the Index, no award 
will vest, irrespective of performance against the EPS targets. The 
Remuneration Committee must also be satisfied that there has been an 
improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company in 
determining the level of vesting in respect of both the EPS Condition and 
the TSR Condition. 
Performance Share Plan
Under the rules of the ASOS Performance Share Plan (PSP ), employees 
may be awarded each year conditional entitlements to shares in the 
Company. Following the introduction of the MIP, no participant in the 
MIP is entitled to be granted any further options under the PSP. 
The performance target for options granted in any financial year is 
measured over a three year period. The performance targets for options 
currently granted under the scheme are:
 annual compound basic ePs  Vesting percentage
 growth of the company over  of the shares
 the performance period subject to an award
 Less than RPI + 10% 0%
 Equal to RPI + 10% 25%
 Greater than or equal to RPI + 30% 100%
 Between RPI + 10%   Between 25% and 100% 
 and RPI + 30% pro rata on a straight-line basis
The Remuneration Committee may amend the performance conditions 
applying to existing awards at any given time if an event occurs 
which causes the Committee to consider it appropriate to amend 
them, provided that, in the opinion of the Committee, the amended 
conditions are not materially less challenging to achieve in the changed 
circumstances than those originally set. /ASOS plc 48

DirECtOrS' rEMunErAtiOn rEpOrt COntinuED
The Remuneration Committee will review the performance conditions 
each time new awards are granted and may impose different performance 
conditions for subsequent awards, provided that, in the opinion of the 
Committee, the different performance conditions are not materially less 
challenging in light of the Company's circumstances than those set for the 
initial awards.
EMI Share Option Scheme
The EMI Share Option Scheme is a historical scheme, with final options 
being granted under the scheme during the year ended 31 March 2009. 
The scheme awarded share options to executive directors and senior 
executives with vesting periods of between one and three years. Options 
granted under the EMI Share Option Scheme have no performance 
conditions attached and were only dependent on continued employment. 
The exercise price of the options granted under the scheme is set equal 
to the market value of the Company's shares at the time of grant.
SAYE Scheme
ASOS introduced an HM Revenue & Customs Approved Save-As-You-
Earn share option scheme (the SAYE Scheme ) on 1 July 2008. The 
scheme is open to all employees who enter an approved savings 
contract for a term of three years. Under the rules of the scheme eligible 
employees can contribute between  5 and  250 a month. On maturity, 
the employee has the option to buy shares in the Company up to the 
total savings at the end of the term at the market value less a 20% 
discount at the date of grant. In common with most schemes of this 
type, there are no performance conditions applicable to options granted 
under the SAYE Scheme.
Other Share Option Scheme
The Other Share Option Scheme is an unapproved historical scheme. 
Options granted under this scheme have no performance conditions 
attached and were only dependent on continued employment. The 
exercise price of the options granted under the scheme is set equal to 
the market value of the Company's shares at the time of grant.
employee Benefit trust
The ASOS.com Limited Employee Benefit Trust (EBT ) is used to 
facilitate the acquisition of ordinary shares in the Company for the 
purpose of satisfying awards and options granted under the Company's 
PSP and SAYE share schemes. The Trust is a discretionary trust, the sole 
beneficiaries being employees (including executive directors) and former 
employees of the Group and their close relations. The Trustee is Ogier 
Employee Benefit Trustee Limited, an independent professional trustee 
company based in Jersey. It is the Company's intention to use the 
ordinary shares in the Trust to satisfy certain outstanding awards and 
options made under the Company's executive share schemes.
As at 31 March 2011 the EBT held 947,859 shares in ASOS plc  
(2010: 1,437,305) to the value of  3,275,000 (2010:  3,197,000). 
The Group's accounting policy is detailed within Note 1 to the financial 
statements and movements are detailed in the Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity on page 69.
Directors' service contracts
All executive directors are employed under service contracts. The 
services of all executive directors may be terminated by the provision 
of a maximum of 12 months' notice by the Company and the individual. 
Services of non-executive directors may be terminated by the provision 
of a maximum of 3 months' notice by the Company and the individual. ASOS plc /
