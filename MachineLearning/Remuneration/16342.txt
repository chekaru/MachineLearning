DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
REMUNERATION POLICY 
The Group's remuneration policy aims to attract, retain and motivate 
high calibre and high performing executive directors. It does so by 
providing the appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced long-term 
performance, and by rewarding executive directors for their individual 
contributions to the success of the Group in a fair, consistent and 
reasonable manner. The Group is focused on creating shareholder value 
and on rewarding high performance with high rewards, but not rewarding 
failure. The five remuneration principles set out below have been crafted 
by the Group to align the interests of executive directors, management 
and employees with those of shareholders:
    That rewards should be fair, appropriate and reflective of the Group's 
culture and values;
    That incentives should be strategically aligned with our shareholders;
    That base pay should be competitive, with decisions being informed 
by market data;
    That the total reward cost to the Company should be affordable and 
sustainable;
    That employee communications around pay and rewards should be 
effective and clearly understood. 
In determining the practical application of the principles, the 
Remuneration Committee also take into account all factors which it 
deems necessary, including consideration for local practices when 
recruiting staff internationally.
REMUNERATION COMPONENTS
The remuneration policy of the Company has a number of principal 
components:
Salary and benefits
The basic salaries of executive directors are determined by the 
Remuneration Committee bearing in mind the salaries paid in FTSE-listed, 
AIM-listed and other retail and Internet-based companies. Within that 
frame of reference, it is intended that basic pay should be at or near the 
median. The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme, 
with the Company contributing up to 15% of basic salary for executive 
directors. Executive directors also receive taxable benefits including 
private medical and dental insurance.
Annual Bonus Plan
The annual award of bonuses is conditional upon the achievement 
of target and stretch performance thresholds by reference to agreed 
financial performance measures, namely profit before both tax and 
exceptional items, and personal performance objectives. This scheme 
is applicable to all employees, including executive directors, in each 
case with reference to each individual's salary. The amounts received by 
the Executive Directors under the scheme are detailed in the Directors' 
Remuneration section of this report. Non-executive directors do not 
participate in any bonus plans. 
Going forward for each full financial year, the annual bonus plan 
applicable to all employees, including executive directors, will be framed 
as follows:
    Financial performance to be targeted at divisional level, through the 
application of appropriate department/division performance thresholds 
alongside personal and company performance thresholds;
    Increased weighting to be applied to personal performance where 
roles have less ability to a directly affect financial performance;
    Where appropriate, any Stretch incentive opportunity awarded over 
and above the Target threshold is to be self-funding via a bonus pool 
accumulated as a percentage of additional profit delivered above 
Target; 
    Opportunities will be available through the self-funding Stretch bonus 
pool to award spot awards to exceptional performers in the lower 
employee grades; and 
    Annual bonus awards will in all cases be capped at a maximum of 
100% of the individual's basic pay.
Long-term Incentive and Share Option Plans
The Company believes that employee share ownership strengthens the 
link between employees' personal interests and those of the Company 
and our shareholders. To seek to achieve that aim, the Company currently 
operates a number of share-based incentive schemes and plans, and is 
developing others. Save in respect of options granted under the Other  49 www.asosplc.com / stock code: ASC

Share Option Scheme to Lord Alli and Peter Williams on joining the 
Company, the non-executive directors do not participate and have not 
participated in any bonus plans.
1. SAYE Scheme
ASOS introduced an HM Revenue & Customs Approved Save-As-You-
Earn share option scheme (the SAYE Scheme ) on 1 July 2008. The 
scheme is open to all eligible employees who, during a specified window, 
choose to enter an approved savings contract for a term of three years. 
Under the rules of the scheme employees can contribute between  5 
and  250 a month. On maturity, the employee has the option to use the 
total savings at the end of the term to buy shares in the Company at the 
market value at the commencement date of the applicable three year 
term less a 20% discount. In common with most schemes of this type, 
there are no performance conditions applicable to options granted under 
the SAYE Scheme and, if an employee leaves the Group for whatever 
reason, their savings contract ends and their contributions are returned 
to them.
Since the introduction of the SAYE Scheme, the Company has opened 
five windows for employees to enter the scheme, further details of which 
are provided in note 22 to the Audited Accounts set out on page 100. 
Over 370 out of a total of 983 direct employees currently participate in the 
SAYE scheme. This includes 237 employees who participated in the most 
recent window, which was opened during the year to 31 March 2012, 
and who save an average of  152.40 per month. At the applicable share 
price, completing the full term of their savings contract will entitle them 
to purchase an average of 466 shares in the Company at the end of the 
vesting period. 
Two of these windows have reached their vesting period during the last 
financial year, as set out below:
Grant 1
The vesting period for this grant was 1 August 2011 to 31 January 2012, 
during which all of the participants exercised their options. The average 
pre-tax gain for each participant in Grant 1 (averaged over the six month 
vesting period) is set out below:

Saved  50

Saved  250

Grant 2 
The vesting period for this grant is 1 March 2012 to 31 August 2012. The 
pre-tax gain for each participant in Grant 2 (if exercised on 1 March 2012) 
is set out below:
Grant 2 Number 
of Participants
Saved  50

Saved  250

56  14,562.40  72,812.00
2. Performance Share Plan
Under the rules of the ASOS Performance Share Plan (PSP ), selected 
employees may be awarded conditional entitlements to free shares in the 
Company (provided only that a participant in the Management Incentive 
Plan detailed below is not entitled to be granted any further options under 
the PSP). The performance target for options granted under the PSP is 
measured over a three year period. The performance targets for options 
currently granted under the scheme are:
Annual compound basic underlying 
EPS growth of the company over the 
performance period
Vesting percentage of the 
shares subject to an award
Less than RPI + 10% 0%
Equal to RPI + 10% 25%
Between RPI + 10% and RPI + 30% Between 25% and 100% 
pro rata on a straight-line basis
Greater than or equal to RPI + 30% 100%
If the performance targets relating to an award are met, all shares that 
vest pursuant to that award are awarded to the participant as free shares.
The Remuneration Committee may amend the performance conditions 
applying to existing awards under the PSP at any given time if an event 
occurs which causes the Committee to consider it appropriate to amend 
them, provided that, in the opinion of the Committee, the amended 
conditions are not materially less challenging to achieve in the changed 
circumstances than those originally set. ASOS Plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2012 50
21345-04   ASOSPLC Proof 3
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
The Remuneration Committee has the ability to review the performance 
conditions each time new awards are granted under the PSP and 
may impose different performance conditions for subsequent awards, 
provided that, in the opinion of the Committee, the different performance 
conditions are not materially less challenging in light of the Company's 
circumstances than those set for the initial awards.
3. Management Incentive Plan
Under the terms of the ASOS Management Incentive Plan (MIP ), 
executive directors and certain senior employees were given the 
opportunity to invest their own money to buy new subordinated shares 
issued in a subsidiary company, ASOS.com Limited (the Subsidiary ). 
The rules of the MIP then provided that, depending upon the extent to 
which performance thresholds and conditions were met, the Company 
would then exchange the subordinated ordinary shares in the Subsidiary 
for new shares in the Company in two equal tranches, on 30 September 
2012 and 30 September 2013, contingent on the growth in the enterprise 
value of the Subsidiary.
The MIP was subject to Total Shareholder Return and Earnings Per Share 
performance thresholds and conditions, as explained below, and had 
a three year performance period which ended on 31 March 2012. The 
maximum number of new shares in the Company into which the shares 
in the Subsidiary could be converted was also subject to an overall value 
cap to limit the dilution effect of the MIP , as well as being contingent on 
the growth in the enterprise value of the Subsidiary.
a) Total Shareholder Return
The Total Shareholder Return (TSR ) performance condition required 
the comparison of the TSR on an investment in the Company over the 
three years ended 31 March 2012 (the Performance Period ) with the 
TSR over the Performance Period on a notional investment in all of the 
companies in the FTSE All Share General Retailers Index (the Index ), 
as constituted at the commencement of the Performance Period. Based 
on ASOS's relative performance and subject to the Earnings per Share 
criteria, the vesting percentages based on relative position based on TSR 
growth over the performance period were: 
TSR Growth Index Position
Vesting
 percentage
Top of first decile 100%
First decile 90%
Second decile 80%
Third decile 70%
Fourth decile 60%
Fifth decile 50%
Below fifth decile 0%
If the minimum Total Shareholder Return threshold was not met, no award 
would vest, irrespective of the Earnings Per Share performance.
The graph below illustrates the relative performance of the Company 
against the FTSE All Share General Retailers Index over the Performance 
Period (both rebased to 100 as at 1 April 2009):
Graph to draw
b) Earnings per Share 
The Earnings Per Share (EPS ) performance target comprised 
performance levels based on the compound rate of growth of the 
Company's fully diluted earnings per share (before exceptional items) 
over the Performance Period. Under the plan rules, there were separate 
performance criteria and associated vesting levels for executive directors 
on the one hand, and other senior management participants on the other, 
as detailed below.

c) Remuneration Committee Overrider 
Vesting also required the Remuneration Committee to be satisfied that 
there has been an improvement in the underlying financial performance of 
the Group in determining the level of vesting in respect of both the EPS 
Condition and the TSR Condition. 
Award Vesting
At the end of the performance period, the Company's TSR grew by 
472% over the Performance Period, leading to the Company achieving 
the top position in the first decile. The Company's fully diluted earnings 
per share met the maximum performance condition in respect of the 
EPS condition. As a result of performance against these targets, upon 
the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Company 
approved the exchange of eligible shares in the Subsidiary for 4,000,822 
ordinary shares in the Company (after application of the maximum 
dilution cap) of an equal tax market value (based on an independent 
valuation of the subsidiary) as at the average share price of ASOS Plc 
for the week ended 18 May 2012. Participants will become entitled to 
trade these shares in two tranches, on 30 September 2012 and 30 
September 2013 (dependent on the individual remaining an employee 
of the Company or being deemed to be a  good leaver'). As a result of 
this exchange, the Company will issue 4,000,822 shares on 31 May 
2012, 2,000,411 of which participants will become free to trade on 30 
September 2012 and 2,000,411 of which participants will become free to 
trade on 30 September 2013 (assuming that all eligible individuals remain 
an employee of the Company or are deemed to be a  good leaver'), all of 
which shall be newly issued by the Company. Details of the entitlements 
of each executive director under the MIP are set out on page 53 below.
Proposed New Schemes
Proposed New Long-Term Incentive Plan 
With the completion of the Performance Period for the MIP on  
31 March 2012, the Company wishes to put a new long-term incentive 
plan in place, to ensure that executive management are provided with 
appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced long-term performance, 
in a fair and responsible manner, and are retained and rewarded for their 
individual contributions to the success of the Company. The importance 
of ensuring that a new long-term plan is in place is recognised by ASOS. 
The Company is in the process of crafting the new scheme to ensure 
it fully meets the key requirements of the Company and shareholders, 
at the same time as meeting the Group's remuneration principles. The 
new long-term plan will be put in place with effect from the start of the 
financial year commencing on 1 September 2012. All participants in the 
MIP remain incentivised to remain with the Company until this time given 
that all awards under the MIP do not vest until September 2012 and 
September 2013. 
SIP
In the upcoming financial year, ASOS intends to put in place a new 
HMRC-approved Share Incentive Plan (SIP), where awards are made to 
ensure that every employee has a stake in the Company's future success. 
Whilst the details are still to be finalised and HMRC approval is still be 
obtained, it is intended that all employees would be required to hold 
each award of a certain number of free shares in trust for at least a three 
year vesting period, to ensure that the tax benefits are accrued and that  ASOS Plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2012 52
21345-04   ASOSPLC Proof 3
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
employees are connected to the long-term success of the Company. 
It is also intended that awards would be satisfied through the market 
purchase of the relevant number of shares by the Employee Benefit Trust 
(see below), rather than through the fresh issue of new shares.
CSOP
ASOS also intends to explore the possible establishment of a new 
HMRC-approved Company Share Option Plan (CSOP ) under which 
approved options may be granted up to a maximum of  30,000 of shares 
to each participant with an exercise price equal to the market value of 
ASOS shares. The gain under the CSOP should not be subject to income 
tax or NIC provided that the option is exercised at least three years after 
the date of grant. This new CSOP would be intended to provide an 
alternative to the existing PSP to allow rewards to be provided in a more 
tax efficient way to employees and at a lower cost to the Company.
Historical Share Schemes
EMI Share Option Scheme
The EMI Share Option Scheme is a historical scheme, with final options 
being granted under the scheme during the year ended 31 March 2009. 
The scheme awarded share options to executive directors and senior 
executives with vesting periods of between one and three years. Options 
granted under the EMI Share Option Scheme have no performance 
conditions attached and were only dependent on continued employment. 
The exercise price of the options granted under the scheme is set equal 
to the market value of the Company's shares at the time of grant. Six 
employees have outstanding option awards under the EMI Share Option 
Scheme over a maximum of 2,299,421 shares in the Company. 
Other Share Option Scheme
The Other Share Option Scheme is a historical scheme, under which 
unapproved options were granted with no performance conditions 
attached and only being dependent on continued employment. The 
exercise price of the options granted under the scheme was set equal to 
the market value of the Company's shares at the time of grant.
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUST
The ASOS.com Limited Employee Benefit Trust (EBT ) is used to 
facilitate the acquisition of ordinary shares in the Company for the 
purpose of satisfying awards and options granted under the Company's 
PSP and SAYE share schemes. The EBT is a discretionary trust, the 
sole beneficiaries being employees (including executive directors) and 
former employees of the Group and their close relations. The Trustee is 
Ogier Employee Benefit Trustee Limited, an independent professional 
trustee company based in Jersey. Under the terms of the Trust Deed, the 
Company funds the EBT to purchase on the EBT's own account ordinary 
shares in the Company on the open market in return for the EBT agreeing 
to use the ordinary shares in the Company that it holds to satisfy certain 
outstanding awards and options made under the Company's share 
schemes.
As at 31 March 2012 the EBT held 599,457 shares in ASOS Plc (2011: 
947,859) to the value of  2,932,000 (2011:  3,275,000). The Group's 
accounting policy is detailed within note 1 to the financial statements and 
movements are detailed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity on page 73.
DIRECTORS' SERVICE CONTRACTS
All executive directors are employed under service contracts. For 
executive directors, the Company's policy is that all executives should 
have rolling service contracts with an indefinite term but a fixed period 
of notice of termination. The services of all executive directors may be 
terminated by the provision of a maximum of 12 months' notice by the 
Company or the individual. The Company's policy for non-executive 
directors is that, rather than having service contracts with the Company, 
they have letters of appointment, providing for a maximum of 3 months' 
notice of termination by the Company or the individual at any time, with 
no pre-determined amounts of compensation. 53 www.asosplc.com / stock code: ASC

Under the terms of the option grant to Lord Alli under the historical  Other Share Option Scheme', the Group was liable to satisfy the Employer's 
National Insurance liability arising on exercise of the options up to a total of  600,000. Lord Alli agreed to indemnify ASOS Plc against the remainder of 
the Employer's National Insurance liability. Lord Alli exercised 750,000 options during the year to 31 March 2012 and accordingly the Group satisfied a 
liability for Employers' National Insurance Contributions of  600,000. Lord Alli satisfied the remainder of the liability. 
The market price of ordinary shares at 31 March 2012 was 1,776.75p (2011: 1,707.73p) and the range during the period was from 1,134.03p to
