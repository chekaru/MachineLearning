DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
The Board and Remuneration 
Committee of ASOS aim to ensure that 
ASOS has the best possible team to 
drive continued success and creation 
of shareholder value. 
ASOS does this by rewarding high performance 
with high rewards, without rewarding failure. 
The Remuneration Committee, the Board and 
the Company share the views of the investor 
community on encouraging outstanding 
performance. In the case of ASOS, strong 
performance and enhanced shareholder value 
have been consistently delivered to date and, 
whilst this has resulted in substantial rewards 
this financial year, the Committee believes these 
rewards are consistent with the achievement 
of the Company's objectives. The Committee is 
dedicated to ensuring that all future awards are 
suitably challenging, carry stretching targets and 
are aligned with the Company's strategy. 
During the financial year to 31 August 2013,  
a number of key changes have been made to 
ASOS's remuneration framework to ensure that 
the Company is equipped to deliver the aims of 
its stated remuneration policy. A new long-term 
incentive plan, the ASOS Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(ALTIP), was implemented after consultation with 
major shareholders, to ensure that our most senior 
executives are retained by the business and that 
their interests are aligned with the long-term 
interests of shareholders. In contrast with the 
previous Management Incentive Plan (MIP),  
the ALTIP encompasses a much wider group of 
participants, demonstrating the strengthening in 
depth and breadth of the management team.
Shareholding guidelines have been introduced 
for the first time to ensure that Executive Directors 
demonstrate a clear belief in the Company's 
future prospects, and a new bonus framework 
has been introduced to ensure that short-term 
variable incentives remain aligned to the 
Company's and shareholders' best interests. 
ASOS also introduced a new Share Incentive 
Plan (SIP), which was launched to supplement 
the Company's existing Save-As-You-Earn (SAYE)
Scheme enabling employees to have a stake in 
the Company's future success. 
I am pleased to present the Directors' 
Remuneration Report for the year ended  
31 August 2013, which for the first time will 
be put separately to an advisory shareholder 
vote at the Annual General Meeting.

REMUNERATION POLICY
ASOS is focused on creating shareholder 
value through the achievement of our strategic 
objectives, and our remuneration policy is 
central to translating that focus through to our 
executives and employees. 
The overall aim of ASOS's remuneration policy 
is therefore to attract, retain and motivate high 
calibre and high performing executives, by 
providing appropriate incentives that:
   encourage enhanced long-term performance 
that achieves the Group's strategic 
objectives and creates shareholder value
   reward individuals, over both the short and 
the long term, for their contributions to the 
success of the Group in a fair, consistent 
and reasonable manner
   reward high performance with high 
rewards, but do not reward failure.
To develop that policy, ASOS has crafted five 
supplementary remuneration principles:
   that rewards should be fair, appropriate 
and reflective of the Group's culture and 
values
   that incentives should be strategically 
aligned with our shareholders, over both the 
short and the long term
   that base pay should be competitive, with 
decisions being informed by market data
   that the total reward cost to the Company 
should be affordable and sustainable
   that employee communications around pay 
and rewards should be straightforward and 
effective.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that 
this policy and these principles successfully 
align the interests of Executive Directors, 
management and employees with those of 
shareholders, by ensuring that a significant 
proportion of total remuneration is directly 
linked to the Group's sustained performance 
over both the short and long term. A copy of 
this policy is available on www.asosplc.com.
In determining the practical application of 
the remuneration policy and principles, the 
Remuneration Committee takes into account 
all factors which it deems relevant, including 
packages offered in FTSE-listed, AIM-listed 
and other retail and internet-based companies, 
as well as local practices when recruiting 
employees internationally.
Remuneration policy components
The Company's remuneration policy contains 
the following remuneration components.
 
Fixed remuneration components
Fixed remuneration components play a key 
role in attracting, retaining and motivating 
high calibre and high performing executives. 
ASOS offers three broad components of fixed 
remuneration, as outlined below.
 
Salary 
Within all relevant frames of reference 
(including the salaries paid in FTSE-listed, 
AIM-listed and other retail and internet-based 
companies), it is intended that basic pay should 
be at or near the median. To assess whether 
that policy is met, salaries for employees are 
reviewed once every financial year (along with 
other fixed remuneration components), firstly 
to identify any material changes in the scope 
of the relevant role, and secondly, in light of 
benchmarking data from other applicable 
roles internally and externally. The basic 
salaries of Executive Directors are determined 
by the Remuneration Committee and are not 
benchmarked on an annual basis, but rather as 
required.
Discretion is available for the Company to 
pay above market median salaries where it is 
felt necessary in order to secure or retain any 
particular employee.  
Pensions
The Company operates a defined-contribution 
occupational pension scheme, with the 
Company contributing up to a maximum 
percentage of salary for any employee who 
wishes to join the scheme. The maximum 
percentage is dependent upon the employee's 
career level, and is matched to the level of 
contributions the employee chooses to make 
to the scheme. For the Executive Directors, 
the Company contributes up to a maximum of 
15% of basic salary. 
  ASOS Plc Annual report and accounts 2013 39
Other taxable benefits
Executive Directors also receive taxable 
benefits including private medical insurance 
through the Company's flexible benefits 
scheme,  ASOS extras'. The scheme offers 
all employees a fixed value depending upon 
the employee's career level, which can either 
be used to purchase a variety of benefits, or 
alternatively be taken in cash.
 
Variable remuneration components
Variable remuneration components directly 
link an individual's reward, over both the short 
and the long term, to their contributions to 
the success of the Group in a fair, consistent 
and reasonable manner. The ASOS Review 
System ensures that only high performance 
is rewarded with high reward, that any 
development needs or concerns are managed 
appropriately and that failure is not rewarded. 
 
Annual bonus plan
The annual performance-related bonus plan 
provides a link between remuneration and 
both short-term personal and Company 
performance. This link is achieved by making 
the annual award of bonuses conditional 
upon the achievement of target and stretch 
performance thresholds which are set by 
reference to agreed Company financial 
performance measures and personal 
performance objectives. 
This scheme is applicable to all employees, 
including Executive Directors, in each case 
with reference to a percentage of each 
individual's salary. The extent to which 
the financial performance measures and 
personal performance objectives for each 
of the Executive Directors have been met is 
determined by the Remuneration Committee, 
with discretion being available for that 
Committee to adapt those measures and 
objectives appropriately to take into account 
exceptional items.
The annual bonus plan applicable to all 
employees, including Executive Directors,  
is currently framed as follows (including and 
without limitation for the financial year to  
31 August 2013).
   Financial performance is defined as profit 
before both tax and exceptional items, and 
targets are based on overall Company 
financial performance and divisional 
level financial performance, through the 
application of appropriate Company 
and department/division performance 
thresholds.
   Personal performance thresholds sit 
alongside the financial performance 
thresholds, with increased weighting 
applied to personal performance where 
individuals are less able to directly affect 
financial performance.
   Any stretch incentive opportunity awarded 
over and above the target threshold 
is to be self-funding via a bonus pool 
accumulated as a percentage of additional 
profit delivered above the target, although 
discretion is available for the Remuneration 
Committee to create a stretch bonus pool 
that is not self-funding in the event of 
exceptional circumstances.
   Discretion is also available to make spot 
awards to exceptional performers in the 
lower employee grades.
   Individuals who are deemed not to have 
adequately performed throughout the year 
as determined at their performance review 
are not eligible for a bonus.
   Annual bonus awards are in all cases 
capped at a maximum of 100% of the 
individual's basic pay.
The amounts received by the Executive 
Directors under the annual bonus plan are 
detailed in the remuneration implementation 
section of this report. Non Executive Directors 
do not participate in the annual bonus plan.
Long-term incentive and share option plans
The Company strongly believes that employee 
share ownership strengthens the link between 
employees' personal interests and those of 
the Company and its shareholders, as well 
as strengthening employee retention and 
motivation. With this in mind, and with the 
aim of linking an individual's remuneration 
to Company performance over the longer 
term, the Company currently operates four 
long-term, share-based incentive plans, as 
detailed below. Outstanding awards granted 
under other historic share plans operated 
by ASOS under which previous awards 
remain outstanding are detailed on page 44, 
although no awards were made under those 
historic schemes during the financial year to 
31 August 2013 and it is not proposed to 
make any future awards under those schemes.
The amounts received by the Executive 
Directors under the long-term, share-based 
incentive schemes and plans are detailed in 
the remuneration implementation section of 
this report. Non Executive Directors do not 
participate in any of the current long-term, 
share-based incentive schemes and plans. 
1. Save-As-You-Earn (SAYE) Scheme
ASOS introduced an HMRC-approved Save-
As-You-Earn share option scheme (the  SAYE 
Scheme') on 1 July 2008, which is open to 
all eligible employees. Those employees who 
choose to do so (during a specified grant 
window selected by the Company) enter an 
approved savings contract for a term of three 
years. Under the rules of the SAYE Scheme 
employees can contribute between  5 and 
 250 a month. On maturity, the employee has 
the option to use the total savings at the end 
of the term to buy shares in the Company at 
the market value at the commencement date 
of the applicable three-year term less a 20% 
discount. In common with most schemes of 
this type, there are no performance conditions 
applicable to options granted under the SAYE 
Scheme and, if an employee leaves the Group 
(other than for the good leaver provisions as 
defined in the Scheme rules), their savings 
contract ends and their contributions are 
returned to them.  40
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT continued
2. Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
To ensure that as many employees as possible 
have a stake in the Company's future success, 
ASOS introduced a new HMRC-approved 
Share Incentive Plan (SIP) during the financial 
year. Whilst not formally enshrined in the rules 
of the SIP, it is the intention of the Company 
that awards over a fixed number of free 
shares are made to all eligible employees, 
with this fixed number of shares depending 
upon a four-tier salary threshold. In keeping 
with the Company's desire to strengthen the 
link between employees' personal interests 
and those of its shareholders, and to enable 
all employees to share in the growth of the 
Company, the SIP is structured to provide the 
largest awards under the plan to employees 
earning less than  30,000 who would 
typically be in the lower career levels, with 
awards progressively decreasing in size up 
to the highest employee grade. The amount 
of the annual award is approved by the 
Remuneration Committee.
All employees are required to hold each award 
of free shares in trust for at least a three-year 
vesting period, to ensure that employees' 
interests are aligned to the long-term success 
of the Company. It is intended that awards will 
be satisfied through the market purchase of 
the relevant number of shares by an onshore 
Capita Trust (rather than through the issue of 
new shares), although the Company retains 
discretion in this regard.
 
3. Performance Share Plan (PSP)
In 2006, ASOS established the ASOS 
Performance Share Plan (PSP). It was 
designed to create a stronger link between 
the interests of senior employees, and those 
of the Company and our shareholders, and to 
support retention in key roles.
Under the PSP, selected employees may 
be awarded conditional entitlements to a 
fixed number of free shares in the Company 
(although participants in the ALTIP detailed 
below are not entitled to be granted awards 
under the PSP during the period from the 
implementation of that plan until the end of 
its performance period). Individuals who 
have not adequately performed throughout 
the year are also not eligible to receive a 
grant. Participants in the plan and the amount 
of shares awarded are approved by the 
Remuneration Committee.
The performance target condition for awards 
granted under the PSP is measured over 
a three-year period. The Remuneration 
Committee has the ability to review the 
performance conditions each time new 
awards are granted under the PSP, and may 
impose different performance conditions 
for subsequent awards, provided that, in 
the opinion of the Committee, the different 
performance conditions are not materially 
less challenging in light of the Company's 
circumstances than those set for the initial 
awards. The Remuneration Committee also 
has discretion to amend the performance 
conditions applying to existing awards under 
the PSP at any given time if an event occurs 
which causes the Committee to consider it 
appropriate to amend them, provided that, in 
the opinion of the Committee, the amended 
conditions are not materially less challenging 
in the changed circumstances than those 
originally set.
In the year, the Remuneration Committee 
reviewed and imposed amended  
performance conditions for awards granted 
from 1 September 2012, in light of the 
Company's performance. These are set out  
in the table below. 
All shares that vest pursuant to that award, 
depending on the extent to which the 
performance targets relating to that award 
have been met, are awarded to the participant 
as free shares.
Prior to August 2012, the Company explored 
the possibility of implementing a new HMRC-
approved Company Share Option Plan 
(CSOP). The proposals were not deemed 
complementary to the ASOS remuneration 
policy, therefore the Company did not proceed 
with the implementation of this plan. As a result, 
the Company continues to rely on the PSP as its 
mechanic to link the personal interests of lower 
management and those of the Company and 
our shareholders, as well as to support retention 
of key roles.
 
4. ASOS Long-Term Incentive Plan (ALTIP)
Following consultation with some of its major 
shareholders, the new ALTIP for Executive 
Directors and senior management was 
implemented on 30 April 2013. The purpose of 
the ALTIP is to support the strategy and business 
plan for the three years from 1 September 
2012 by incentivising and retaining the wider 
ASOS senior management team.  
The base value of each participant's award is 
calculated as a fixed multiple of salary (as at 
1 September 2012, or on joining, if later) and 
there is a maximum benefit restriction imposed 
on each participant. Under the terms of the 
ALTIP , awards may be structured in one or both 
of two ways. The structure used depends upon 
whether the participants in the ALTIP make an 
investment equivalent to the tax fair value of all 
or part of their respective awards.
Executive Directors are required to make 
a minimum investment of at least one-third 
of the tax fair value of their award. Senior 
management participants are invited to invest 
at their choosing, with a required minimum 
investment of one-third of the tax fair value 
of their awards. All participants also have 
the opportunity to increase the value of their 
investment voluntarily up to 100% of the tax fair 
value of their award. This upfront investment 
by ALTIP participants is designed to strengthen 
the link between their personal interests and 
those of the Company and its shareholders, 
providing a strong incentive to achieve the 
plan's performance targets. In return, for that 
part of their award for which an investment 
is made, capital gains tax (and potentially

entrepreneur's relief) should be payable by a 
participant on any gain made at vesting, as 
the invested award is purchased at the tax 
fair value. However, these investments will be 
forfeited if the performance conditions of the 
ALTIP are not met.
The proportion of any participant's award that 
is not covered by an upfront investment will be 
granted as conventional nil-cost options (Option 
Scheme Awards). Should a member of senior 
management choose not to make the minimum 
investment of one-third of the tax fair value 
of his or her award, the base value of that 
award will be reduced by 25%, to recognise 
the significantly lower risk profile, whilst still 
providing a market-competitive award value.
At the end of the three-year performance 
period on 31 August 2015, awards under 
the ALTIP will vest in two tranches, subject 
to the achievement of the performance 
conditions (which are set out in more detail 
below): Option Scheme Awards will vest on 
31 October 2015 up to a maximum value of 
50% of a participant's total award; and the 
investment, together with any remaining Option 
Scheme Award, on 31 October 2016.
The ALTIP is subject to challenging, 
interdependent earnings per share (EPS) and 
total shareholder return (TSR) targets, which are 
aligned to the strategic plans of the Company 
and designed to ensure growth is delivered in 
a profitable way. The extent to which an award 
will vest will depend on those interdependent 
EPS and relative TSR performance targets, 
measured over a performance period from 
1 September 2012 to 31 August 2015 (the 
performance period). While the performance 
targets will be tested separately, both hurdles 
must be achieved for the awards to vest. There 
are three performance levels under the EPS 
performance target, as set out below.
   The  threshold' performance level, which 
delivers a 6.7% maximum vesting (subject 
to any scale back as a result of the TSR 
performance), will not be met unless the 
compound rate of growth in fully-diluted 
underlying EPS (before exceptional items, 
but after the cost of the ALTIP) equals 17% 
per annum over the three years ending  
31 August 2015. This equates to fully 
diluted EPS for the year to 31 August 2015 
of 63.4p per share and implies sales  
of  0.9bn.
   The  target' performance level, which 
delivers a 70% maximum vesting (subject 
to any scale back as a result of the TSR 
performance), will not be met unless the 
compound rate of growth in fully diluted 
underlying EPS (before exceptional items, but 
after the cost of the ALTIP) equals 23% per 
annum over the same period. This equates 
to fully diluted EPS for the year to 31 August 
2015 of 73.7p per share and implies sales 
of  1.0bn, providing direct alignment with 
our previously communicated strategy.
   The  stretch' performance threshold, which 
delivers a 100% maximum vesting (subject 
to any scale back as a result of the TSR 
performance), will not be met unless the 
compound rate of growth in fully-diluted 
underlying EPS (before exceptional items, but 
after the cost of the ALTIP) equals or exceeds 
32% per annum over the same period. This 
equates to fully diluted EPS for the year to  
31 August 2015 of 91.1p per share and 
implies sales of  1.3bn.
The TSR performance condition requires 
the comparison of TSR on an investment in 
ASOS with TSR on a notional investment in 
a comparator group during the performance 
period. The comparator group comprises 
all of the companies in the FTSE All-Share 
General Retailers Index, as constituted at the 
commencement of the performance period, 
plus Mulberry Group plc. The TSR performance 
will be applied to the outturn from the EPS 
performance condition and may scale back 
(potentially to zero) whatever would have 
vested solely under the EPS condition. There 
will be no scale back to the EPS outturn if the 
TSR of ASOS is at the upper quartile or above. 
The award will be scaled back progressively in 
the event that the TSR of ASOS is below upper 
quartile, such that there will be a scale back 
of up to one-third if ASOS's TSR is at median. 
There will be zero vesting if ASOS's TSR is 
below median.
Participants of the ALTIP will not receive any 
awards under the Company's existing PSP 
from implementation until the end of the 
performance period. Shareholding guidelines 
were also introduced at the same time as the 
implementation of the ALTIP , as set out below.
The actual operation of the ALTIP scheme is 
detailed in the remuneration implementation 
section of this report.
 
Shareholding guidelines
Alongside the ALTIP , shareholding guidelines 
have been introduced to ensure a continuing 
link between Executive Directors' interests 
and those of shareholders following the ALTIP 
vesting. 
These guidelines require Executive Directors to 
retain 50% of any shares acquired on vesting 
of the ALTIP , and any subsequent share awards 
thereafter (net of tax), until the following 
shareholdings are achieved:
   Chief Executive Officer: five times salary
   other Executive Directors: two times salary.
As at 31 August 2013, the Chief Executive 
Officer was already compliant with this policy. 
The other Executive Directors will become 
compliant when the ALTIP vests. 
 
Employee Benefit Trust
The ASOS.com Limited Employee Benefit Trust 
(EBT) and the Capita Trust (CT) are used to 
facilitate the acquisition of ordinary shares 
in the Company for the purpose of satisfying 
awards and options granted under the 
Company's share schemes, in particular the 
PSP, SAYE Scheme and the SIP. The EBT is a 
discretionary trust, the sole beneficiaries being 
employees (including Executive Directors) 
and former employees of the Group and their 
close relations, who have received awards 
under the PSP and SAYE Scheme. The Trustee 
is Ogier Employee Benefit Trustee Limited, an 
independent professional trustee company 
based in Jersey. Under the terms of the Trust 
Deed, the Company funds the EBT to purchase 
on the EBT's own account ordinary shares in 
the Company on the open market in return for 
the EBT agreeing to use the ordinary shares 
in the Company that it holds to satisfy certain 
outstanding awards and options made under 
the Company's share schemes. The CT holds 
shares awarded under the SIP solely for 
the benefit of current employees (including 
Executive Directors) who participate in the 
SIP. Under the terms of the Trust Deed the 
Company funds the CT to purchase the shares 
on the open market and retain those shares 
on behalf of the underlying beneficiaries until 
such time as they can be removed.
The EBT and CT are both recognised within 
the Employee Benefit Trust reserve for 
accounting purposes.  42
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT continued
As at 31 August 2013 the EBT and CT 
combined held 436,033 shares in ASOS Plc 
(31 August 2012: 505,374) to the value of 
 1,770,386 (31 August 2012:  2,464,000). 
The Group's accounting policy is detailed 
within note 1 to the financial statements and 
movements are detailed in the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity on page 50.
 
Service contracts
All Executive Directors are employed under 
service contracts. It is the Company's policy that 
all Executive Directors should have rolling service 
contracts with an indefinite term but a fixed 
period of notice of termination. The services of 
all Executive Directors may be terminated by the 
provision of a maximum of 12 months' notice by 
the Company or the individual. 
The Company's policy for Non Executive 
Directors is that, rather than having service 
contracts with the Company, they have letters 
of appointment, providing for a maximum 
of three months' notice of termination by the 
Company or the individual at any time, with 
no pre-determined amounts of compensation.
 
Recruitment
When recruiting any Executive Director or 
senior executive, the Company seeks to apply 
consistent policies on fixed and variable 
remuneration components. For example, 
it is the Company's intention that salaries 
are set within benchmark parameters, and 
employee career levels are determined by a 
job evaluation process, with bonus entitlement, 
pension and flexible benefits allowance being 
automatically determined by that career level. 
The granting of payments or share awards on 
joining in order to secure the appointment of an 
Executive Director or senior executive is limited. 
However where in exceptional circumstances 
such a payment or award might form part of 
a prospective employee's package, it would 
require the prior approval of the Remuneration 
Committee for Executive Directors and members 
of the Executive Board, and of the People 
Director for all other employees. 
 
Policy developments
Any revisions to the remuneration policy 
set out above require the approval of 
the Remuneration Committee, to whom 
responsibility for the policy has been 
delegated by the Board of Directors.
 
REMUNERATION IMPLEMENTATION

Directors' share options
Management Incentive Plan (MIP)
For the performance period from 1 April 2009 
to 31 March 2012, the Company put in place 
a MIP, full details of which are set out in the 
Directors' Remuneration Reports of the Annual 
Reports and Accounts for the year ended  
31 March 2012 and the five months ended 
31 August 2012. Under the MIP, participants 
became entitled on 31 May 2012 to a total 
of 4,000,822 newly issued shares in the 
Company, which they were able to trade in 
two tranches on 30 September 2012 and  
30 September 2013 (in each case dependent 
on the individual remaining an employee of 
the Company at that date or being deemed  
to be a  good leaver'). 
2,000,411 of these shares were traded by 
participants during the financial year to  
31 August 2013, following the expiry of the 
restrictions on trading those shares, as set out 
in the table below. Participants will become 
free to trade the remaining 2,000,411 shares 
issued in relation to the MIP on 30 September 
2013, again as detailed in the table, and 
assuming that all eligible individuals remain 
an employee of the Company on that date 
or are deemed to be a  good leaver' (and 
at all times subject to any close period share 
dealing restrictions). A nominee holds those 
shares until that date.
ASOS Long-Term Incentive Plan
In the financial year to 31 August 2013, the 
Company granted awards under the ALTIP 
detailed above to Executive Directors and 
other senior managers. The base value of 
each participant's award was calculated as a 
multiple of salary (as at 1 September 2012). 
The awards made to the Executive Directors 
are set out in the table below.
Director Base award value
Nick Robertson  5,000,000
Nick Beighton  3,500,000
Kate Bostock   4,000,000
Upon her resignation from the Company, Kate 
Bostock's award under the ALTIP was returned 
to the Company, and her initial investment in 
the ALTIP was refunded to her. 
ASOS's total shareholder return (TSR) 
performance for the three-month period 
ending 31 August 2013 compared with the 
three-month period ended 31 August 2012 
currently ranks the Company in third place 
within the FTSE All-Share General Retailers 
Index. Growth in TSR over this period of 
ASOS and of that Index is illustrated in the 
chart below.
There is a maximum benefit restriction imposed 
on each participant. Given that maximum 
benefit restriction, the Company expects the 
maximum dilution to existing shareholders due 
to awards under the ALTIP to be approximately 
1.3 million ordinary shares (or c.1.5% of 
issued share capital as at 31 August 2013).

a)  Lord Alli exercised 829,657 share options during the year, with a total value on exercise of  17,732,503 and share price on exercise of  21.50. Nick Beighton 
exercised 2,700 share options during the year, with a total value on exercise of  87,507 and share price on exercise of  35.77. Robert Bready exercised 254 
share options during the year with a total value on exercise of  4,079 and share price on exercise of  27.83. 
b)  The other share option scheme is a historical scheme, under which unapproved options were granted with no performance conditions attached and only being 
dependent on continued employment. The exercise price of the options granted under the scheme was set equal to the market value of the Company's shares at the 
time of grant. All options granted under this scheme have now been exercised. 
c)  SAYE Scheme option grants are settled on exercise through transfer of shares from the Employee Benefit Trust. Grants under the EMI Share Option Scheme and the 
other share option scheme are settled on exercise through the issue of new ordinary shares by the Company. 
d)  The EMI Share Option Scheme is a historical scheme, with final options being granted under the scheme during the year ended 31 March 2009. The scheme 
awarded share options to Executive Directors and senior executives with vesting periods of between one and three years. Options granted under the EMI Share 
Option Scheme have no performance conditions attached and were only dependent on continued employment. The exercise price of the options granted under the 
scheme is set equal to the market value of the Company's shares at the time of grant. 
The market price of ordinary shares at 31 August 2013 was  47.50 (31 August 2012:  18.30) and the range during the year to  
31 August 2013 was from  17.96 to  50.19 (five months to 31 August 2012:  13.95 to  18.72).
