REMUNERATION POLICY FOR NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
 
 The non-executive directors each receive a fee for their services, which is agreed by the Board after reviewing 
comparable organisations and appointments.  None of the non-executive directors receive a pension or other benefits 
from the Company, nor do they participate in any bonus or incentive schemes or share option schemes. 
 
 The non-executive directors do not have service contracts with the Company.  In accordance with the Articles of 
Association, each retires from office at the third annual general meeting after the annual general meeting at which he was 
last elected.  A retiring director is eligible for re-election.
