Remuneration report 
Remuneration levels are set by reference to individual
performance, experience and market conditions with a view to
providing a package which is appropriate for the responsibilities
involved. Under the terms of the group's existing arrangements:

the achievement of demanding preset targets relating 
to operating profit and return on capital employed.

contractual obligation.

The company operates an executive pension scheme for senior
executives, which is incorporated in the main group scheme. 
The scheme is a defined benefit scheme whereby retirement
benefits based on final remuneration and length of service are
funded through a trustee administered scheme. The company
pays contributions to the scheme on behalf of executives, based 
on the recommendations of the independent actuary who carries
out a valuation of the scheme every three years.
No director has a contract of service with the company which 
is determinable after one year.
