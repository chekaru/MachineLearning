Remuneration
report
1. Introduction 
This report sets out the policy and 
disclosures on directors' remuneration as
required by the Directors' Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002 ( the Regulations')
contained in schedule 7A of the Companies
Act 1985. In accordance with the
Regulations, a resolution to approve this
report will be proposed at the forthcoming
annual general meeting of the company. 
The vote will have advisory status in respect 
of the remuneration policy and overall
remuneration packages and will not be
specific to individual levels of remuneration.
2. The Remuneration committee
The Remuneration committee is responsible 
to the board for determining the remuneration
policy for executive directors, together with the
specific terms and conditions of employment
of each individual director, and for reviewing
the overall policy for executive remuneration.
Committee composition
The Remuneration committee consists of five
non-executive directors. The members of the
committee are:
Martin Adamson (chairman)
Lord MacGregor
Mike Alexander
Jeff Harris
Tim Clarke
Consultants
The committee has retained Towers Perrin 
to provide independent market information
and remuneration advice on an ongoing
basis. Towers Perrin does not provide any
other consulting services to the company. 
In addition to Towers Perrin, the following
people provided material advice or services 
to the committee during the year:
George Weston - Chief Executive 
Peter Jackson - Chief Executive 
(retired March 2005)
Mark Goodridge - Interim Group Human
Resources Director
Clive Francis - Group Human Resources
Director (until March 2005)
3. Directors' remuneration policy 
The remuneration policy of the company
aims to:
  Provide alignment between remuneration
and the company's business objectives
  Attract and retain high calibre directors
  Motivate directors to achieve challenging
performance levels
  Recognise both individual and corporate
achievement
  Align executive rewards with shareholder
value.
The total remuneration of executive directors
comprises base salary, annual and long-term
incentives, pension provisions and other
benefits. It is the company's policy to provide 
a significant portion of the total potential
rewards through performance-based schemes.
The proportion of variable pay to fixed pay 
has increased over the past few years, and 
will continue to be kept under review.
Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed in relation 
to median market data for comparable
companies in terms of size, market sector and
complexity. Other considerations are individual
experience, performance and scope of
responsibility. Base salaries are normally
reviewed on an annual basis, or following 
a significant change in responsibilities. 
Annual performance bonus
Each executive director is eligible to
participate in an annual cash-based bonus
scheme with payments based on the
achievement of stretching financial targets
and personal performance against individual
short and medium term objectives. Targets
are set by the Remuneration committee at the
beginning of the financial year. The scheme
provides an incentive opportunity in the range
of 0% to 65% of base salary for executive
directors with an expected value of around
40% for  on target' performance. 
Long-term incentives
The Associated British Foods Executive Share
Incentive Plan 2003 ( the Share Incentive
Plan') was established for executive directors
and other key executives for the three year
period ending 16 September 2006. The plan
rewards superior growth in profits and cash
flow and encourages investment in suitable
growth opportunities.
The value of this long-term incentive is 
up to 150% of base salary over three years
and is subject to testing at the end of the
performance period in 2006 against a 
pre-determined operating profit target range.
This target range is demanding, but in any
case payouts will not be made to scheme
participants if growth in earnings per share 
is below RPI + 4% per annum on average
over the three year period of the plan.
Awards under the Share Incentive Plan 
are in the form of a conditional allocation 
of shares, which will be released if, and 
to the extent that, the performance targets
described are satisfied over the specified
three year period. Allocations of company
shares to a maximum value of 150% of
salary were allocated in December 2003
following shareholder approval at the 
2003 annual general meeting, and shares 
to meet these obligations have been
acquired on the market.
Share option schemes
There are two schemes under which options
may be granted as both Inland Revenue
approved and as unapproved options.
  The Associated British Foods 1994 Share
Option Scheme ( the 1994 Scheme')
requires options granted to be held for five
years before they become exercisable at
which point they are not subject to any
performance criteria.

*Retired as a director of the company on 31 March 2005.
Until December 2000, the 1994 Scheme
was the only share option scheme operated
by ABF. Following approval of the 2000
Scheme described below by shareholders
in December 2000 which contained
performance criteria, no further options
were granted under the 1994 Scheme
other than options required to be granted
to Peter Jackson and John Bason under
pre-existing contractual arrangements with
them, which have now been satisfied.
  The Associated British Foods 2000 Executive
Share Option Scheme ( the 2000 Scheme')
requires that options granted under this
scheme become exercisable by participants
after an initial three year performance period
to the extent that performance criteria have
been satisfied by reference to the audited
accounts. Performance criteria are based 
on robust levels of business performance
over the period. 
The committee has confirmed that although
share options may continue to be granted 
on a selected basis, share option awards 
will not form part of the normal ongoing
remuneration package for executives.
Other benefits
Executive directors are also entitled to the
provision of a fully expensed company car,
private medical insurance, life assurance,
home and mobile telephone costs and the
reimbursement of reasonable business
expenses. The taxable value of these 
benefits is included in the table of Directors'
remuneration below.
5. Directors' pensions 
The Remuneration committee aims to ensure
that retirement benefits should be in line with
best practice standards adopted by major
companies in Continental Europe and the
United Kingdom. 
In accordance with this policy, executive
directors are covered by final salary defined
benefit arrangements and can retire at their
normal retirement age with retirement benefits,
broadly equivalent to two thirds of final
pensionable salary. The company pension
schemes are Inland Revenue approved. 42

Directors' pension disclosure for year ended 17 September 2005
The table below shows the defined benefit pension entitlements from the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme ( the ABF Scheme') 
and unfunded unapproved arrangements where appropriate, of executive directors of Associated British Foods plc who were members of the 
ABF Scheme during the year ended 17 September 2005.

Peter Jackson 77 64 481 - 1,345 10,118 6,874 3,244
Notes:
1. Pension accruals (A) and (C) are the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of year or earlier
retirement. Peter Jackson was in receipt of a pension from 1 April 2005.
2. The pension values (E), (F) and (G) are transfer values calculated in accordance with version 8.1 of guidance note GN11 issued by the
actuarial profession.
3. The value of net increase in pension (E) represents the incremental value to the director of his pension benefits during the year, 
resulting from additional service and increases in salary. 
It is based on the increase in accrued pension net of inflation (B) after deducting the director's contribution during the year (D).
4. The change in the transfer value (H) includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the
company and directors, such as stock market movements.
The director's contributions during the year (D) are excluded from this value.
5. John Bason and George Weston accrue pension in the ABF Scheme up to the earnings cap. In order to provide a pension on their earnings
above this level, the company has established unfunded unapproved retirement benefits schemes. 
6. Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
7. Pension benefits include a 50% spouse's pension (except in the case of Peter Jackson where there is a two thirds spouse's pension)
payable on death before or after retirement. Pensions are guaranteed to increase in payment in line with RPI limited each year to 5%.
Additional discretionary increases to pensions in payment have been granted in the past. 
8. Peter Jackson retired on 31 March 2005 and elected to take a lump sum of  1,081,237 in lieu of part of his pension entitlement. 
The figures above are based on his pension entitlement before this lump sum payment was made.

8. Performance review
The performance graph illustrates the performance of the company over the past five years in terms of total shareholder return compared with that
of the companies comprising the FTSE 100 index. This index has been selected because it represents a cross-section of leading UK companies.
9. Directors' service contracts 
It is the company's policy that all executive directors have rolling contracts with 12 month notice periods. The Articles of Association of
Associated British Foods plc require that all directors retire from office at every third annual general meeting. The details of the directors'
contracts of service as at 17 September 2005 are set out below: 
Effective Notice Notice

Martin Adamson 11.10.99 11.12.02 6 months 6 months

Tim Clarke 03.11.04 03.11.04 6 months 6 months
*Peter Jackson retired from the board on 31 March 2005.
The board has not considered it appropriate to enter into a formal letter of appointment with Galen Weston in view of his relationship with 
the ultimate holding company of Associated British Foods plc, Wittington Investments Limited. He receives no fees for performing his role 
as a non-executive director and Associated British Foods plc does not reimburse him for any expenses incurred by him in that role.
The committee takes a view that the entitlement of the executive directors to the security of 12 months' notice of termination of employment 
is in line with practice of many comparable companies. 
The Remuneration committee's aim is always to deal fairly with cases of termination whilst taking a robust line in minimising any compensation.
The Remuneration committee has given due consideration to the recommendations contained in the Combined Code regarding inclusion of explicit
provisions in directors' service contracts for compensation commitments in the event of early termination. The committee will continue to keep
under review its current practice, which is not to include such provisions in order to enable it to respond appropriately to particular circumstances.
