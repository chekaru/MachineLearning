1. Introduction
This report sets out the policy and disclosures on directors'
remuneration as required by the Directors' Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002 ( the Regulations') contained in schedule 7A of the
Companies Act 1985. In accordance with the Regulations, a resolution
to approve this report will be proposed at the forthcoming annual
general meeting of the Company. The vote will have advisory status
in respect of the remuneration policy and overall remuneration
packages and will not be specific to individual levels of remuneration.
KPMG Audit Plc has audited the report to the extent required by the
Companies Act, being the sections entitled  Directors' remuneration',
 Long-term incentives',  Directors' pensions' and  Directors'
share options'.
2. The Remuneration committee
The Remuneration committee is responsible to the board for
determining the remuneration policy for executive directors, together
with the specific terms and conditions of employment of each individual
director, and for reviewing the overall policy for executive remuneration.
Committee composition
The Remuneration committee consists of five non-executive directors.
The members of the committee are Martin Adamson (chairman),
Lord MacGregor, Mike Alexander, Jeff Harris and Tim Clarke.
Consultants
The committee has retained Towers Perrin to provide independent
market information and remuneration advice on an ongoing basis.
Towers Perrin does not provide any other consulting services to
the Company.
In addition to Towers Perrin, the following people provided material
advice or services to the committee during the year:
George Weston - Chief Executive
Mark Goodridge - Interim Group Human Resources Director
(until December 2005)
Des Pullen - Group Human Resources Director (from January 2006)
Both the HR Directors named above provided support and liaison
with Towers Perrin.
3. Directors' remuneration policy
The remuneration policy of the Company aims to:
  Provide alignment between remuneration and the Company's
business objectives
  Attract and retain high calibre directors
  Motivate directors to achieve challenging performance levels
  Recognise both individual and corporate achievement
  Align executive rewards with shareholder value.
The total remuneration of executive directors comprises base
salary, annual and long-term incentives, pension provisions and
other benefits.
Over the past year the Remuneration committee has undertaken
a detailed review of the total remuneration package of executive
directors and other senior executives of the Company, both in relation
to the level of potential payouts and in relation to the targeting and
monitoring of appropriate performance measures.
It has been agreed that a substantial element of executive compensation
should be  at risk' in order to reward and drive increased performance,
reflect the market trend and to better align the interests of executives
with those of shareholders. Although the proportion of variable pay
to fixed pay has increased over the past few years, this proportion
will increase further with the new annual and long-term incentive
arrangements which have been put in place from September 2006.
Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed in relation to median market data for
comparable companies in terms of size, market sector and complexity.
Other considerations are individual experience, performance and
scope of responsibility. Base salaries are normally reviewed on an
annual basis, or following a significant change in responsibilities.
Annual performance bonus
Each executive director is eligible to participate in an annual
cash-based bonus scheme with payments based on the achievement
of stretching financial targets and personal performance against
individual short and medium-term objectives. Targets are set by the
Remuneration committee at the beginning of the financial year. In
2005/6, the scheme provided an incentive opportunity in the range
of 0% to 65% of base salary for executive directors with an expected
value of around 40% for  on target' performance.
Following the review of incentives mentioned above, the
Remuneration committee has determined that with effect from the
beginning of the new financial year the annual incentive opportunity
for executive directors will be in the range 0 to 100% of base salary,
with an  on target' value of around 53%.
Long-term incentives
The Associated British Foods Executive Share Incentive Plan 2003
( the Share Incentive Plan') was established for executive directors and
other key executives for the three year period ending 16 September
2006. The plan rewards superior growth in profits and cash flow and
encourages investment in suitable growth opportunities.
Awards under the Share Incentive Plan are in the form of a
conditional allocation of shares, which will be released if, and to the
extent that, the performance targets are satisfied over the specified
three year period. Allocations of Company shares to a maximum
value of 150% of salary were made in December 2003 following
shareholder approval at the 2003 annual general meeting, and
shares to meet these obligations have been acquired on the market.
The face value of this long-term incentive was 150% of base
salary over three years and was subject to testing at the end of the
performance period, in 2006, against a pre-determined operating
profit target range modified by return on capital employed. These
targets were demanding, but awards were also subject to a further
performance hurdle whereby no awards would be made to participants
if earnings per share were below RPI + 4% per annum on average
over the three year period of the plan.

The directors' interests in shares under the Share Incentive Plan are as follows:
Market Shares Conditional Conditional
price at End of vested allocations allocations of
Award date of performance Vesting during Value of shares as shares as
date award period date the year vested at 18.09.05 at 16.09.06
George Weston 17.12.03 565p 16.09.06 17.12.06 -- 70,354 70,354
John Bason 17.12.03 565p 16.09.06 17.12.06 -- 110,177 110,177
Following the end of the 2003-2006 performance period, it has been
determined that under the rules of the scheme, 65.1% of the conditional
shares allocated in December 2003 will vest in December 2006.
From the beginning of the 2006/7 financial year, under the revised
incentive plan arrangements, executive directors will receive annual
grants of conditional shares, with overlapping three year performance
periods. Grants will continue to be made under the Associated British
Foods Executive Share Incentive Plan 2003 with the face value of
these grants at 125% per annum. Long-term performance under this
plan will be based on compound growth in adjusted earnings per
share, in a range of 5% to 11% per annum.
Share option schemes
There are two schemes under which options may be granted as both
Inland Revenue approved and unapproved options.
  The Associated British Foods plc 1994 Share Option Scheme
( the 1994 Scheme') under which options may be granted to
purchase ordinary shares in the Company to selected qualifying
employees over the ten years from November 1994. Options
granted must be held for five years before they become exercisable
at which point they are not subject to any performance criteria.
Until December 2000, the 1994 scheme was the only share option
scheme operated by ABF. Following approval by shareholders in
December 2000 of the 2000 scheme (described below), which
contained performance criteria, no further options have been
granted under the 1994 Scheme other than options required
to be granted to John Bason under pre-existing contractual
arrangements, which have now been satisfied.
  The Associated British Foods 2000 Executive Share Option
Scheme ( the 2000 Scheme') requires that options granted under
this scheme become exercisable by participants after an initial
three year performance period to the extent that performance
criteria have been satisfied. Performance criteria are based on
robust levels of business performance over the period. Options
under this scheme may be granted to selected employees over
the ten years from 15 December 2000.
The committee confirmed last year that although share options
may continue to be granted on a selective basis, share option
awards will not form part of the normal ongoing remuneration
package for executives.
Other benefits
Executive directors are also entitled to the provision of a fully
expensed company car, private medical insurance, life assurance,
home and mobile telephone costs and the reimbursement of
reasonable business expenses. The taxable value of these benefits
is included in the table of Directors' remuneration below.

5. Directors' pensions
The Remuneration committee aims to ensure that retirement benefits should be in line with best practice standards adopted by major
companies in Continental Europe and the United Kingdom.
In accordance with this policy, executive directors are covered by final salary defined benefit pension arrangements and can retire at their
normal retirement age with retirement benefits, broadly equivalent to two thirds of final pensionable salary. The Company pension schemes
are Inland Revenue approved.
Directors' pension disclosure for year ended 16 September 2006
The table below shows the defined benefit pension entitlements from the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme ( the ABF Scheme'),
and unfunded unapproved arrangements where appropriate, of executive directors of Associated British Foods plc who were members

Notes:
1. Pension accruals (A) and (C) are the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of year or earlier retirement.
2. The pension values (E), (F) and (G) are transfer values calculated in accordance with version 9.2 of guidance note GN11 issued by the
actuarial profession.
3. The value of net increase in pension (E) represents the incremental value to the director of his pension benefits during the year, resulting
from additional service and increases in salary. It is based on the increase in accrued pension net of inflation (B) after deducting the director's
contribution during the year (D).
4. The change in the transfer value (H) includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the
Company and directors, such as stock market movements. The directors' contributions during the year (D) are excluded from this value.
5. Both directors opted out of the ABF Scheme on 5 April 2006, and from then on earned benefits in the Employer Financed Retirement
Benefit Scheme.
6. Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
7. Pension benefits include a 50% spouse's pension. Pensions are guaranteed to increase in payment in line with RPI limited each year to 5%.

8. Directors' service contracts
It is the Company's policy that all executive directors have rolling contracts with 12 month notice periods. The Articles of Association of
Associated British Foods plc require that all directors retire from office at every third annual general meeting. The details of the directors'
contracts of service as at 16 September 2006 are set out below:
Effective Notice Notice
date of period period
Date of current from from
appointment contract Company director
Martin Adamson 11.10.99 11.12.02 6 months 6 months
George Weston 19.04.99 01.06.05 12 months 12 months
John Bason 04.05.99 16.03.99 12 months 12 months
Lord MacGregor 09.12.94 16.11.99 6 months 6 months
Mike Alexander 16.01.02 16.01.02 6 months 6 months
Jeff Harris 21.05.03 21.05.03 6 months 6 months
Tim Clarke 03.11.04 03.11.04 6 months 6 months
The board has not considered it appropriate to enter into a formal letter of appointment with Galen Weston in view of his relationship with the
ultimate holding company of Associated British Foods plc, Wittington Investments Limited. He receives no fees for performing his role as a
non-executive director and Associated British Foods plc does not reimburse him for any expenses incurred by him in that role.
The committee takes the view that the entitlement of the executive directors to the security of 12 months' notice of termination of employment
is in line with practice of many comparable companies.
The Remuneration committee's aim is always to deal fairly with cases of termination whilst taking a robust line in minimising any
compensation. The Remuneration committee has given due consideration to the recommendations contained in the Combined Code
regarding inclusion of explicit provisions in directors' service contracts for compensation commitments in the event of early termination.
The committee will continue to keep under review its current practice, which is not to include such provisions in order to enable it to
respond appropriately to particular circumstances.
9. Directors' beneficial interests
The directors of the Company as at 16 September 2006 had the following beneficial interests in the shares and debentures of the Company,
its holding company and fellow subsidiary undertakings.

10. Non-executive directors
The board reviews non-executive directors' fees periodically in the
light of fees payable in comparable companies and the importance
attached to the retention and attraction of high calibre individuals
as non-executive directors. Fees are paid on a per annum basis
and are not varied for the number of days worked. The chairman
of the Audit committee and the senior independent director are
paid an additional fee. Non-executive directors do not participate
in the Company's annual or long-term incentive plans, and take
no part in any discussion or decision concerning their own fees.
11. Executive directors serving as non-executive directors
The Remuneration committee has determined that executive
directors serving as non-executive directors of other companies
may retain any fees earned. During the year, George Weston
served as a non-executive director of Wittington Investments
Limited, for which he received no compensation.
