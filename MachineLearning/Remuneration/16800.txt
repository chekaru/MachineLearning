Remuneration report
1. Introduction
This report sets out the policy and disclosures on directors' remuneration  
as required by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002  
( the Regulations') contained in schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985.  
In accordance with the Regulations, a resolution to approve this report will 
be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting of the Company. 
The vote will have advisory status in respect of the remuneration policy and 
overall remuneration packages and will not be specific to individual levels of 
remuneration. KPMG Audit plc has audited the report to the extent required 
by the Companies Act, being the sections entitled  Directors' remuneration', 
 Long-term incentives',  Directors' pensions' and  Directors' share options'.
2. The Remuneration committee
The Remuneration committee is responsible to the board for determining 
the remuneration policy for executive directors, together with the specific 
terms and conditions of employment of each individual director, and for 
reviewing the overall policy for executive remuneration.
Committee composition
The Remuneration committee currently consists of six non-executive 
directors. The members of the committee during the year were:
Martin Adamson (Chairman) 
Mike Alexander (until December 2007) 
Tim Clarke (from January 2008) 
Javier Ferr n 
Lord Jay (from January 2008) 
Lord MacGregor (until December 2007) 
Charles Sinclair (from November 2008) 
Peter Smith
Consultants
The committee has retained Towers Perrin to provide independent market 
information and remuneration advice on an ongoing basis. Towers Perrin 
does not provide any other consulting services to the Company. 
In addition to Towers Perrin, the following people provided material advice 
or services to the committee during the year:
George Weston, Chief Executive  
Des Pullen, Group Human Resources Director  
The HR Director and Towers Perrin provided support and liaison throughout  
the year.
3. Directors' remuneration policy 
The ongoing remuneration policy of the Company aims to:
   provide alignment between remuneration and the Company's business 
objectives; 
  attract and retain high calibre executive directors;
  motivate executive directors to achieve challenging performance levels;
  recognise both individual and corporate achievement; and
  align executive rewards with shareholder value.
The total remuneration of executive directors comprises base salary, annual 
and long-term incentives, pension provisions and other benefits. 
Following a detailed review of the total remuneration package of executive 
directors and other senior executives in 2006, it was agreed that a 
substantial element of executive compensation should be  at risk' in order  
to reward and drive increased performance, reflect the market trend and  
to align better the interests of executives with those of shareholders. The 
proportion of maximum variable pay, in the form of annual performance 
bonus and long-term incentives, compared to base salary has increased over 
the past few years, and now stands at around 2:1 for executive directors. 
Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed in relation to median market data for comparable 
companies in terms of size, market sector and complexity. Other 
considerations are individual experience, performance and scope of 
responsibility. Base salaries are normally reviewed on an annual basis  
or following a significant change in responsibilities. 
Annual performance bonus
Executive directors and other senior executives are eligible to participate  
in an annual cash-based bonus scheme with payments based on the 
achievement of stretching financial targets and personal performance 
against individual short and medium-term objectives. Adjusted operating 
profit and working capital financial targets are set by the Remuneration 
committee at the beginning of each financial year. 
Incentive plans are due to be reviewed during the 2008/9 financial year,  
but recent pay positioning has shown that, in spite of the improvements 
introduced in 2006, the market has continued to enhance incentives available 
to senior executives such that the Company is well behind the desired market 
position in both annual and long term plans. The Remuneration committee 
has therefore agreed, that for 2008/9, the maximum incentive opportunity 
for executive directors will be increased to 150% of base salary, with an 
expected value of around 78% for  on target' performance. 
Long-term incentives
The Associated British Foods Executive Share Incentive Plan 2003 ( the 
Share Incentive Plan') was established following shareholder approval at the 
2003 annual general meeting. Under this scheme, long-term awards are 
made in the form of a conditional allocation of shares which are released if, 
and to the extent that, performance targets are satisfied over a specified 
three-year period. 
The first allocations to executive directors and other senior executives were 
made in December 2003. The maximum face value of the allocation for 
executive directors was 150% of base salary, with no expectation of further 
allocations being made during that three-year performance period. 
As a result of the detailed review of total remuneration undertaken in 2006, 
revised incentive plan arrangements were introduced in September 2006,  
and it was agreed that executive directors should be granted an annual  
allocation of conditional shares thus creating a series of overlapping 
three-year performance periods. 
The first allocation under the new arrangements was made in November  
2006, and the second allocation in November 2007. Both these allocations  
were to a maximum face value of 125% of base salary, and relate to 
three-year performance periods, September 2006 to September 2009  
and September 2007 to September 2010 respectively. 
Performance under this long-term share plan will be measured against  
a range of 5% to 11% compound annual growth in adjusted earnings per 
share. Adjusted earnings per share was chosen as the measure for long-term 
incentives as it is transparent and easily understood both by participants  
and shareholders. 
As the first of the new three-year, long-term incentive plans will not mature 
until December 2009, arrangements were put in place to cover the gap in 
competitive remuneration for the two interim years, 2006/7 and 2007/8.  
The Remuneration committee set interim adjusted earnings per share targets 
for 2006/7 and 2007/8 which are milestones towards the adjusted earnings 
per share target set for 2009. The 2006/7 adjusted earnings per share result  
was measured against the 2006/7 interim target and the first of the two 
arrangements settled in cash in December 2007. The 2007/8 adjusted earnings 
per share result has been measured against the target set in September 2006 
and this arrangement will be settled in cash in December 2008. 
In line with the policy outlined above, it has been agreed that the third 
allocation of conditional shares under the new arrangements, to a 
maximum face value of 125% of base salary, will be made on or after  
21 November 2008. The committee has reviewed the performance criteria 
and has determined that this allocation will again be measured against 
compound annual growth in adjusted earnings per share, in the range of  
5% to 11% at the end of the performance period in September 2011.  Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2008 // 31

5. Directors' pensions 
The Remuneration committee aims to ensure that retirement benefits are in line with best practice standards adopted by major companies in Continental 
Europe and the United Kingdom. 
In accordance with this policy, executive directors are covered by final salary, defined benefit arrangements and can retire at their normal retirement age  
with retirement benefits broadly equivalent to two thirds of final pensionable salary. The Company pension schemes are HMRC approved but the executive 
directors also have entitlements under employer-financed arrangements which are unregistered.

5. Directors' pensions continued
Notes:
1. Pension accruals (A) and (C) are the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of year or earlier retirement. 
2.  The pension values (E), (F) and (G) are transfer values calculated in accordance with version 9.3 of guidance note GN11 issued by the Board of  
Actuarial Standards.
3.  The value of net increase in pension (E) represents the incremental value to the director of his pension benefits during the year, resulting from additional  
service and increases in salary. It is based on the increase in accrued pension net of inflation (B) after deducting the director's contribution during the  
year (D).
4.  The change in the transfer value (H) includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and 
directors, such as stock market movements. The director's contributions during the year (D) are excluded from this value.
5.  Both directors opted out of the ABF scheme on 5 April 2006 and since then have earned benefits in the Employer Financed Retirement Benefit Scheme 
(EFRBS). The figures shown represent the aggregate of benefits in the ABF scheme and the EFRBS.
6. Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
7.  Pension benefits include a 50% spouse's pension. Pensions are guaranteed to increase in payment in line with RPI, limited each year to 5% for service  
accrued to 31 December 2007. The service accrued from that date will only attract pension increases in payment of RPI capped at 2.5%. Additional 
discretionary increases to pensions in payment have been granted in the past.
6. Directors' share options
There are two schemes under which both HMRC approved and unapproved options may be granted:
   The Associated British Foods plc 1994 Share Option Scheme ( the 1994 Scheme') requires options granted to be held for five years before they become 
exercisable, at which point they are not subject to any performance criteria; and
   The Associated British Foods 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme ( the 2000 Scheme'), under which options granted become exercisable by participants  
after an initial three-year performance period, to the extent that performance criteria have been satisfied. Performance criteria are based on robust levels  
of business performance over the period. 
It has been agreed that share option awards will not form part of the normal ongoing remuneration package for executives, although the Remuneration 
committee reserves the right to grant share options on a very selective basis.
The number of share options held by the directors under the 1994 Scheme and the 2000 Scheme were as follows:

The gain made on exercise of share options was  47,550.
At close of business on 12 September 2008, the last trading day before the end of the financial year, the market value of the Company's ordinary shares  
was 789p. During the previous 12 months the price ranged from 716.5p to 925p.

7. Performance review
The performance graph illustrates the performance of the Company over 
the past five years in terms of total shareholder return compared with that 
of the companies comprising the FTSE 100 index. This index has been 
selected because it represents a cross-section of leading UK companies.
8. Directors' service contracts 
It is the Company's policy that all executive directors have rolling contracts 
with 12 month notice periods. The Company's Articles of Association 
require that all directors retire from office at every third annual general 
meeting. Details of the contracts of service of directors who served during 
the year ended 13 September 2008 are set out below:

Peter Smith 28.02.07 28.02.07 6 months 6 months
 
* Mike Alexander and Lord MacGregor retired as non-executive directors  
on 7 December 2007.
The board has not considered it appropriate to enter into a formal letter  
of appointment with Galen Weston in view of his relationship with the 
ultimate holding company of Associated British Foods plc, Wittington 
Investments Limited. He receives no fees for performing his role as a 
non-executive director and Associated British Foods plc does not reimburse 
him for any expenses incurred by him in that role.
The committee takes the view that the entitlement of the executive 
directors to the security of 12 months notice of termination of employment 
is in line with the practice of many comparable companies. 
The Remuneration committee's aim is always to deal fairly with cases  
of termination whilst taking a robust line in minimising any compensation. 
The Remuneration committee has given due consideration to the 
recommendations contained in the Combined Code regarding inclusion  
of explicit provisions in directors' service contracts for compensation 
commitments in the event of early termination. The committee will  
continue to keep under review its current practice, which is not to  
include such provisions in order to enable it to respond appropriately  
to particular circumstances. 
9. Directors' beneficial interests
The directors of the Company as at 13 September 2008 had the following 
beneficial interests in the shares and debentures of the Company, its 
holding company and fellow subsidiary undertakings.

In addition to the above, George Weston and John Bason were allocated a 
conditional grant of shares under the Share Incentive Plan, details of which 
are shown on page 31.
The interests shown above remained the same as at 4 November 2008.
10. Non-executive directors
The board reviews non-executive directors' fees periodically in the light  
of fees payable in comparable companies and the importance attached to the 
retention and attraction of high-calibre individuals as non-executive directors. 
Fees are paid on a per annum basis and are not varied for the number of days 
worked. The chairman of the Audit committee and the senior independent 
director are paid an additional fee. Non-executive directors do not participate 
in the Company's annual or long-term incentive plans and take no part in any 
discussion or decision concerning their own fees. 
Adjustments were made to the fees in December 2007 following a period  
of two years in which the fees had remained unchanged. The next review 
will take place in December 2009.
11. Executive directors serving as non-executive directors
The Remuneration committee has determined that executive directors 
serving as non-executive directors of other companies may retain any  
fees earned. 
During the year, George Weston served as a non-executive director of 
Wittington Investments Limited, for which he received no compensation. 
12. Compliance statement
In compliance with the UK Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations  
2002, the auditable part of the Remuneration report comprises directors' 
remuneration on page 31, directors' pensions on pages 31 and 32, directors' 
share options on page 32 and directors' beneficial interests on page 33.

Statement of directors' responsibilities in respect of the annual report and the financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the group  
and parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company 
financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they are 
required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the 
parent company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting 
Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
The group financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted  
by the EU to present fairly the financial position and the performance of  
the group; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial 
statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial 
statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving  
a fair presentation.
The parent company financial statements are required by law to give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the parent company and of the profit  
or loss of the parent company for that period. In preparing each of the group 
and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
   for the group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared  
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
   for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable  
UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial 
statements; and 
   prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it  
is inappropriate to presume that the group and the parent company  
will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets  
of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for 
preparing a directors' report, directors' remuneration report and corporate 
governance statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
