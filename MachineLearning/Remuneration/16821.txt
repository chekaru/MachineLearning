6 Directors' share options
There are two schemes under which both HMRC approved and unapproved options may be granted:
 	 	 The 	 Associat ed 	 British 	 F oods 	 plc 	 1994 	 Share 	 Option 	 Scheme 	 ( the 	 1994 	 Scheme') 	 requires 	 options 	 gr ant ed 	 to 	 be 	 held 	 f or 	 fiv e 	 y ears 	 bef ore 	 the y 	 become 	 exercisable,

an initial three-year performance period, to the extent that performance criteria have been satisfied. Performance criteria are based on robust levels of business 
performance over the period. 
It has been agreed that share option awards will not form part of the normal remuneration package for executives, although the Remuneration committee reserves  
the right to grant share options on a very selective basis.
The number of share options held by the directors under the 1994 Scheme and the 2000 Scheme were as follows:

8. Directors' service contracts 
It is the Company's policy that all executive directors have rolling contracts  
with 12 month notice periods. The Company's Articles of Association require  
that all directors retire from office at every third annual general meeting.  
Details of the contracts of service of directors who served during the year  
ended 12 September 2009 are set out below: 
    Effective date Notice Notice

* Martin Adamson retired as non-executive Chairman on 21 April 2009. 
** Charles Sinclair's notice period will reduce to six months from April 2010.
The board has not considered it appropriate to enter into a formal letter of 
appointment with Galen Weston in view of his relationship with the ultimate  
holding company of Associated British Foods plc, Wittington Investments Limited.  
He receives no fees for performing his role as a non-executive director and  
Associated British Foods plc does not reimburse him for any expenses incurred  
by him in that role.
The committee takes the view that the entitlement of the executive directors to  
the security of 12 months' notice of termination of employment is in line with the 
practice of many comparable companies. 
The Remuneration committee's aim is always to deal fairly with cases of termination 
whilst taking a robust line in minimising any compensation. The Remuneration 
committee has given due consideration to the recommendations contained  
in the Combined Code regarding inclusion of explicit provisions in directors'  
service contracts for compensation commitments in the event of early termination.  
The committee will continue to keep under review its current practice, which is  
not to include such provisions in order to enable it to respond appropriately to 
particular circumstances. 
9. Directors' beneficial interests
The directors of the Company as at 12 September 2009 had the following 
beneficial interests in the shares of the Company and its holding company.

Property, plant & equipment
The group's property, plant & equipment are included in the financial statements 
at depreciated historic cost. The properties are employed in the business and  
many of them were acquired when market values were substantially lower than 
at present. The directors consider that a surplus over book value exists, but have  
not quantified the excess.
Substantial shareholding and controlling interest
Details of a controlling interest in the shares of the Company are given in note 30 
on page 104. 
Other than as noted above, so far as is known, no other person holds or is 
beneficially interested in a disclosable interest in the Company. 
Power to issue shares 
At the last annual general meeting, held on 5 December 2008, authority was  
given to the directors to allot unissued relevant securities in the Company up to  
a maximum of an amount equivalent to one third of the shares in issue at any  
time up to 4 December 2013. No such shares have been issued. The directors 
propose to renew this authority at the annual general meeting to be held on  
4 December 2009 for the following year.
A further special resolution passed at that meeting granted authority to the 
directors to allot equity securities in the Company for cash, without regard to  
the pre-emption provisions of the Companies Act 1985. This authority expires  
on the date of the annual general meeting to be held on 4 December 2009  
and the directors will seek to renew this authority for the following year.
Power to purchase the Company's own shares is also provided in the Articles 
subject to statutory provisions. The Company has no existing authority to  
purchase its own shares.
Appointment of directors 
The Company's Articles of Association (the  Articles') give the directors power to 
appoint and replace directors. Under the terms of reference of the Nomination 
committee, any appointment must be recommended by the Nomination 
committee for approval by the board of directors. The Articles also require the 
directors to retire and submit themselves for election at the first annual general 
meeting following appointment and all directors who held office at the time  
of the two preceding annual general meetings, and in any event not less than  
one third of the directors, to submit themselves for re-election. In accordance  
with the Combined Code, all non-executive directors who have served for more  
than nine years must also submit themselves for election on an annual basis.
Articles of Association 
The Articles themselves may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders. 
Power of the directors 
The directors are responsible for managing the business of the Company and  
may exercise all the powers of the Company subject to the provisions of relevant 
statutes, to any directions given by special resolution and to the Company's 
Memorandum and Articles. The Articles, for example, contain specific provisions 
and restrictions concerning the Company's power to borrow money. As indicated 
above, powers relating to the issuing of shares are also included in the Articles  
and such authorities are renewed by shareholders at the annual general meeting 
each year. Other disclosures continued

Directors' report // Governance // Other disclosures
Significant agreements 
The group has a number of borrowing facilities provided by various banking groups. 
These facility agreements generally include change of control provisions which,  
in the event of a change in ownership of the Company, could result in their 
renegotiation or withdrawal. The most significant agreements are the US$1.2bn 
syndicated loan facility which was signed on 12 October 2006 and under which 
 211m was drawn down at the year end, the  320m syndicated loan facility  
which was signed on 14 October 2008 and under which no funds were drawn down  
at the year end and the  120m Finance Contract from the European Investment 
Bank which was signed on 5 December 2007 and under which  120m was drawn 
down at the year end.
In addition to these bank facilities, in March 2009 the Company issued US$610m 
of private placement notes to institutional investors. In accordance with the 
scheduled maturities, no repayment of these notes had taken place by the  
year end. In the event of a change in ownership of the Company, the Company  
is obliged to make an offer of immediate repayment to the note holders.
There are a number of other agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon  
a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid, such as commercial 
contracts and joint venture agreements. None is considered to be significant  
in terms of its potential impact on the business of the group as a whole. 
Essential contracts or arrangements
Individual companies in the group have contractual and other arrangements with 
many third parties in support of the group's businesses activities. Such contracts 
and arrangements may be deemed essential to one or more operating companies 
but there are no contracts or arrangements considered to be essential to the group 
as a whole. Through the British Sugar IPA Agreement via the National Farmers 
Union, approximately 1,000 individual contracts with sugar beet growers are created.
