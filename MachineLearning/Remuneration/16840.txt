DIRECTORS' REPORT // GOVERNANCE // REMUNERATION REPORT
Remuneration report
1. Introduction
This report sets out the policy and disclosures on directors' remuneration as 
required by the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 issued under the Companies Act 2006 (the  Act').  
In accordance with the Act, a resolution to approve this report will be proposed  
at the forthcoming annual general meeting of the Company. The vote will have 
advisory status in respect of the remuneration policy and overall remuneration 
packages and will not be specific to individual levels of remuneration. KPMG 
Audit Plc has audited the report to the extent required by the Companies Act, 
being the sections entitled directors' remuneration, long-term incentives, 
directors' pensions and directors' share options.
2. The Remuneration committee
The Remuneration committee is responsible to the board for determining the 
remuneration policy for executive directors, together with the specific terms  
and conditions of employment of each individual director, and for reviewing  
the overall policy for executive remuneration.
Committee composition
The Remuneration committee currently consists of five non-executive directors. 
The members of the committee who held office during the year and at the date 
of this report are:
Charles Sinclair (chairman) 
Tim Clarke 
Lord Jay 
Javier Ferr n 
Peter Smith
Consultants
The Remuneration committee has retained T owers Watson to provide 
independent market information and remuneration advice. T owers Watson  
does not provide any other consulting services to the Company.
In addition to T owers Watson, the following people provided material advice  
or services to the committee during the year:
George Weston, Chief Executive 
Des Pullen, Group HR Director
George Weston did not advise in respect of his own remuneration. The Group HR 
Director and T owers Watson provided support and liaison throughout the year.
3. Directors' remuneration policy
The remuneration policy of the Company aims to:

The remuneration of executive directors is determined by the Remuneration 
committee taking into account group performance, individual potential and 
competitive market practice. The total remuneration of executive directors 
comprises base salary, annual and long-term incentives, pension provisions  
and other benefits.
The Remuneration committee continues to believe that a substantial element of 
compensation should be  at risk' in order to reward and drive performance and to 
align better the interests of executives with those of shareholders. The proportion 
of variable pay in the form of annual performance bonus and long-term incentives 
compared to base salary for executive directors in 2009/10 was around 1.3 to 1 
for  on target' performance. The committee believes that this proportion is low in 
relation to the current size and complexity of the group. It has therefore proposed 
that this ratio be increased to 1.6 to 1 for 2010/11 by making increases to the 
expected value of long-term incentive awards.

2 Annual performance bonus  
  on target' 34%
3 Long-term incentive
 expected value 22%
2009/10

First line reports to the Chief Executive and other senior executives are also 
rewarded within the same overall remuneration policy as executive directors,  
in order to ensure commonality across the group. Other executives therefore 
participate in incentive arrangements similar to those of the executive directors, 
but with lower levels of potential payout.
In 2009/10 the proportion of variable pay to base salary for first line executives 
was around 0.8 to 1 for  on target' performance. In line with the increase being 
proposed for executive directors, it is agreed that this ratio should rise to 1 to 1  
for the financial year 2010/11.
Details of all changes are described in the sections below.
Base salary
Base salaries are paid to individuals for delivering a fully competent level of 
performance, and are reviewed in relation to median market data for comparable 
companies in terms of size, market sector and complexity. Other considerations 
are individual experience, performance and scope of responsibility. Base salaries 
are normally reviewed on an annual basis or following a significant change 
in responsibilities.

3. Directors' remuneration policy continued
Annual performance bonus
Executive directors and other senior executives are eligible to participate in an 
annual cash-based bonus scheme with payments based on the achievement of 
stretching financial targets and personal performance assessed against individual 
short and medium-term objectives. Financial targets for all executives are set on  
a business-by-business basis and reflect what can be directly influenced and the 
area of work for which each executive is accountable. Adjusted operating profit 
and working capital were chosen as the prime financial measures as they are 
common metrics which are used on a day-to-day basis to drive and monitor 
performance within the group. 
At the start of the financial year, budgeted operating profit is set as the  on 
target' performance level, and the Remuneration committee determines the 
range of operating profit at which minimum and maximum incentive payouts  
will be made. Similarly, the target and range for working capital as a percentage 
of sales is determined at the start of the financial year. This metric is used as  
a multiplier to the bonus achieved for adjusted operating profit, whereby that 
bonus can be enhanced or reduced by up to 20%. 
The maximum annual performance bonus opportunity for executive directors  
in 2009/10 was 150% of base salary. When the current bonus plans were put  
in place in 2006 it was agreed that achievement of specific personal objectives 
should normally account for around 20% of the total annual performance bonus 
opportunity. However it was also agreed that this should be capped at 20% of 
base salary in all cases. Consequently, of the 2009/10 annual bonus opportunity 
of 150% for executive directors, up to 20% may be paid for achievement of 
specific personal objectives and up to 130% may be paid for achievement  
of financial results as outlined above.  On target' performance yields around  
78% of base salary. 
As reported previously, in 2009 the Remuneration committee reviewed the annual 
performance bonus plans for executive directors and other senior executives. It 
concluded that the current arrangements were working satisfactorily and that it did 
not wish to alter the focus or metrics of the scheme. During 2010 the committee 
reviewed the level of annual performance bonus plan yields and was again 
satisfied that no changes should be made for executive directors. The maximum 
annual performance bonus opportunity for executive directors in 2010/11 will 
therefore remain at the present level of 150%. However, it was also decided that 
maximum annual performance bonus yields for other groups of executives below 
board level should be increased by an average of 15% of base salary, as these  
had fallen below the level required to attract and retain high-calibre individuals.

Long-term incentives
Long-term incentives are paid in shares to reward long-term business growth and 
to promote executive retention. The Associated British Foods Executive Share 
Incentive Plan 2003 ( the Share Incentive Plan') was established following 
shareholder approval at the 2003 annual general meeting. Under this plan, 
long-term awards are made in the form of a conditional allocation of shares 
which are released if, and to the extent that, performance targets are satisfied 
over a specified three-year period. 
Since 2006, annual allocations of conditional shares have been made to 
executive directors and other senior executives thus creating a series of 
overlapping three-year performance periods. For executive directors, all these 
allocations were to a maximum face value of 125% of base salary, and relate  
to performance periods of three financial years. Group performance under  
the long-term share plan for all four allocations are being measured against  
an absolute range of 5% to 11% compound annual growth in adjusted earnings 
per share.
Adjusted earnings per share remains the measure chosen for long-term group 
incentives because:
 	 i t 	 i s 	 a 	 me a sur e 	 wh i ch 	 i s 	 w ell 	 under s t ood 	 b y 	 bo th 	 par ti ci pan t s 	 and 	 shar eholder s;	
 	 i t 	 i s 	 a 	 publ i she d 	 f i gur e 	 wi th 	 l i m i t e d 	 ad j us tmen t s; 	 and
 	 i t 	 enc ompa sse s 	 the 	 d iv er se 	 natur e 	 o f 	 the 	 gr oup .
An absolute rather than a relative measure is used as the group is a global 
business for which UK inflation factors are largely irrelevant. 
Other measures have been considered, but found to be unhelpful or inappropriate. 
Measures which require testing against a group of companies, for example, relative 
TSR, are difficult to use given the problem of finding appropriate comparator 
companies. Cash flow or return measures have been considered, but these are  
to some extent already encompassed within the earnings per share measure,  
are likely to require many adjustments over a three-year period, and may reward 
volatility and thus detract from a direct growth measure. 
For the three financial years from September 2006 to September 2009 adjusted 
earnings per share grew by 4.27%. As the group target was not met, no shares 
were released to executive directors for the 2006/9 scheme. However, for the 
three-year performance period ended September 2010, the compound annual 
growth in adjusted earnings per share was 10.92%. Consequently the executive 
directors will receive 99.12% of the shares allocated in 2007. Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2010 47
DIRECTORS' REPORT // GOVERNANCE // REMUNERATION REPORT
Long-term incentives for executives with divisional responsibility are largely 
measured against adjusted operating profit and working capital targets,  
set by reference to the business for which each executive is directly responsible. 
The long-term share awards for these executives therefore depend on the level  
of performance achieved in each business. In 2010, 68 divisional executives, 
representing around 91% of all eligible participants, will also receive a release  
of shares in November.
Under the current terms of the Share Incentive Plan, the fifth allocation  
of conditional shares will be made on or after 23 November 2010 for the 
performance period September 2010 to September 2013. The Remuneration 
committee has reviewed the performance criteria and has determined that this 
allocation will again be measured against an absolute range of 5% to 11% 
compound annual growth in adjusted earnings per share. The Remuneration 
committee believes that this range remains achievable but stretching over the 
next three-year period, given the scale of investments required to deliver this 
growth, the complexity of some of the projects involved and the volatility present 
in many of the markets in which the group operates.
In addition, as the Company is now set to enter another phase of demanding 
growth, it needs to continue the development of teams of committed executives 
to meet the challenges ahead. In order to do this successfully, the Company must 
ensure that remuneration packages are sufficient to attract and retain exceptional 
executive talent. The current levels of long-term incentive plan opportunity have 
remained unchanged since 2006 and the Remuneration committee is concerned 
that these awards are not now competitive, nor commensurate with the increased 
size, complexity and international reach of the organisation. 
Agreement will therefore be sought from shareholders, at the 2010 annual 
general meeting, for an increase in the maximum grant level of the Associated 
British Foods Executive Share Incentive Plan 2003 from 150% to 200% of base 
salary. Details of the proposal will be found on page 4 of the Notice of annual 
general meeting 2010 in a note to the proposed resolutions. 
The Remuneration committee also believes that those executives who most 
closely influence the sustained long-term growth of the Company should also  
be required to demonstrate their commitment to the Company by aligning their 
personal interests to the success of the group and its shareholders. Consequently, 
from the beginning of the 2010/11 financial year, executive directors and all first 
line reports to the Chief Executive will be expected to build up a shareholding  
in the Company to a value at least equal to their pre-tax base salary. In order  
to achieve this target, executives will be required to retain at least 50% of any 
post-tax shares vesting each year from 2013, until such time as the appropriate 
level of shareholding has been achieved, and then to manage their shareholding 
in such a way as to continue to meet the requirement.
Other executives participating in the share-based long-term incentive plan will  
be encouraged to build up a beneficial interest in the Company, but will not be 
required to do so.
4. Directors' remuneration 
Executive directors 
Executive directors' salaries were reviewed on 1 December 2009 in accordance 
with normal policy. In line with most other UK executives across the group, the 
salaries of both executive directors were increased by 1.5%. George Weston's 
salary was increased to  873,000 per annum and John Bason's salary was 
increased to  586,000 per annum. 
Executive directors' salaries are next subject to review on 1 December 2010.
The financial element of the annual bonus to be paid to executive directors  
in respect of the 2009/10 financial year is 130% of base salary. This reflects  
the strong financial performance of the group over the past year when adjusted 
operating profit and working capital both exceeded the maximum of the ranges 
set. The maximum payout in respect of the personal element of the annual  
bonus is 20%, around 13% of the total annual bonus. Actual bonuses to be  
paid to each of the executive directors for the personal element are based on  
an assessment of their individual performance against specific objectives for  
the 2009/10 financial year.
Executive directors are also entitled to the provision of a fully expensed company 
car, private medical insurance, life assurance, home and mobile telephone costs 
and the reimbursement of reasonable business expenses. The taxable value of 
these benefits is included in the table of directors' remuneration on page 48.
Non-executive directors 
The board reviews non-executive directors' fees periodically in the light of fees 
payable in comparable companies and the importance attached to the retention 
and attraction of high-calibre individuals as non-executive directors. Fees are paid 
on a per annum basis and are not varied for the number of days worked. 
The current fee for a non-executive director is  54,000 per annum. The chairman 
of the Audit committee and the Senior Independent Director are paid an 
additional fee of  10,000 per annum. Following postponement of the fee review 
last year, these fees have now remained unchanged for a period of three years. 
The Chairman is paid an annual fee of  300,000 per annum, which is unchanged 
since April 2009, when he was appointed to the role. 
Non-executive directors do not participate in the Company's annual or long-term 
incentive plans and take no part in any discussion or decision concerning their 
own fees. 
Following the recent board evaluation and fee review, with advice from T owers 
Watson, the executive directors have agreed that the simple fee structure for 
non-executive directors should remain in place. It is also agreed that from 
1 December 2010 the fee for a non-executive director will rise to  60,000  
per annum, with an additional fee of  12,500 per annum payable to the 
chairman of the Audit committee and the Senior Independent Director.  
The Chairman's fee will rise to  335,000 from the same date.  Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2010 48

5. Directors' pensions
The Remuneration committee aims to ensure that retirement benefits are in line with best practice standards adopted by major companies in continental Europe and the 
United Kingdom.
In accordance with this policy, executive directors are covered by final salary, defined benefit arrangements and can retire at their normal retirement age with retirement 
benefits broadly equivalent to two thirds of final pensionable salary. The Company pension schemes are HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) approved but the executive 
directors also have entitlements under employer-financed arrangements which are unregistered. 
Over the past year the Remuneration committee has been following governmental proposals for pension reform in 2011 and the potential impact that any proposals will 
have on high earners, including executive directors. The committee will review the options and conclude the best way forward for all those affected when governmental 
proposals have been finalised.
Directors' pension disclosure for year ended 18 September 2010
The table below shows the defined benefit pension entitlements from the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme ( the ABF Scheme'), and employer-financed arrangements 
where appropriate, of executive directors of Associated British Foods plc who were members of the ABF Scheme during the year ended 18 September 2010.

Notes:
1.  Pension accrual (C) is the total amount which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year or earlier retirement.
2.  The pension values (E), (F) and (G) are transfer values calculated in accordance with Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer Values) Regulations 2008 and  
Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 (but making no deduction for underfunding).
3.  The value of net increase in pension (E) represents the incremental value to the director of his pension benefits during the year, resulting from additional service  
and increases in salary. It is based on the increase in accrued pension net of inflation (B) after deducting the director's contribution during the year (D).
4.  The change in the transfer value (H) includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and directors,  
such as stock market movements. The directors' contributions during the year (D) are excluded from this value.
5.  Both directors opted out of the ABF Scheme on 5 April 2006, and since then have earned benefits in the Employer Financed Retirement Benefit Scheme (EFRBS).  
The figures shown represent the aggregate of benefits in the ABF Scheme and the EFRBS.
6.  Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
7.  Pension benefits include a 50% spouse's pension. Pensions are guaranteed to increase in line with RPI limited each year to 5% (2.5% for benefits accrued post  
1 January 2008). Additional discretionary increases to pensions in payment have been granted in the past. Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2010 49

an initial three-year performance period, to the extent that performance criteria had been satisfied. Performance criteria were based on robust levels of business 
performance over the period. 
Some years ago it was agreed that share option awards would no longer form part of the normal remuneration package for executives although the Remuneration 
committee reserved the right to grant options under special circumstances.
All share options held by the executive directors under the 1994 Scheme and the 2000 Scheme were exercised during the year as follows:

8. Directors' service contracts
It is the Company's policy that all executive directors have rolling contracts with 
12-month notice periods. The Company's Articles of Association require that all 
directors retire from office if they have not retired by rotation at the preceding 
two annual general meetings. Details of the contracts of service of directors  
who served during the year ended 18 September 2010 are set out below: 
    Effective date Notice Notice 
   Date of of current period from period from

The board has not considered it appropriate to enter into a formal letter of 
appointment with Galen Weston in view of his relationship with the ultimate 
holding company of Associated British Foods plc, Wittington Investments Limited. 
He receives no fees for performing his role as a non-executive director and 
Associated British Foods plc does not reimburse him for any expenses incurred  
by him in that role.
The Remuneration committee takes the view that the entitlement of the 
executive directors to the security of 12 months' notice of termination of 
employment is in line with the practice of many comparable companies. 
The Remuneration committee's aim is always to deal fairly with cases of 
termination whilst taking a robust line in minimising any compensation. The 
Remuneration committee has given due consideration to the recommendations 
contained in the Combined Code regarding inclusion of explicit provisions in 
directors' service contracts for compensation commitments in the event of early 
termination. The Remuneration committee will continue to keep under review  
its current practice, which is not to include such provisions in order to enable it  
to respond appropriately to particular circumstances.
9. Directors' interests
The directors of the Company as at 18 September 2010 had the following

as non-executive directors of other companies may retain any fees earned.

Voluntary Service Overseas and as deputy chairman of the charity FareShare. 
Neither director received compensation in respect of any of these roles.
