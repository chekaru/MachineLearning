 1. Introduction
This report sets out the policy and disclosures on directors' 

Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
issued under the Companies Act 2006 ( the Act'). In accordance 
with the Act, a resolution to approve this report will be proposed at 
the forthcoming annual general meeting of the Company. The vote 
will have advisory status in respect of the remuneration policy and 
overall remuneration packages and will not be specific to individual 
levels of remuneration. KPMG Audit Plc has audited the report to  
the extent required by the Act, being the sections entitled  Directors' 
remuneration',  Long-term incentives' and  Directors' pensions'.
2. The Remuneration committee
The Remuneration committee is responsible to the board for 
determining the remuneration policy for executive directors,  
together with the specific terms and conditions of employment  
of each individual director, and for reviewing the overall policy  
for executive remuneration.
Committee composition
The Remuneration committee currently consists of five non- 
executive directors. The members of the committee who held  
office during the year and at the date of this report are:
Charles Sinclair (chairman) 
Tim Clarke 
Lord Jay 
Javier Ferr n 
Peter Smith
Consultants
The Remuneration committee has retained Towers Watson to 
provide independent market information and remuneration advice. 
Towers Watson does not provide any other consulting services to 
the Company.
In addition to Towers Watson, the following people provided material 
advice or services to the committee during the year:
George Weston, Chief Executive 
Des Pullen, Group HR Director
George Weston did not advise in respect of his own remuneration. 
The Group HR Director and Towers Watson provided support and 
liaison throughout the year.
3. Directors' remuneration policy
The remuneration policy of the Company aims to:
 provide alignment between remuneration and the Company's 
business objectives; 
 align executive rewards with shareholder value;
 attract and retain high-calibre executive directors;
 motivate executive directors to achieve challenging performance 
levels and reward them for so doing;
 recognise both individual and corporate achievement; and
 reflect the diversity of the group's interests.
The remuneration of executive directors is determined by the 
Remuneration committee taking into account group performance, 
individual performance and competitive market practice as well as 
the pay and conditions of the group's UK employees. The total  
annual remuneration of executive directors comprises base salary,  
a cash bonus, shares granted under a long-term incentive scheme, 
pension provisions and other benefits.
The Remuneration committee continues to believe that a substantial 
element of compensation should be  at risk' in order to reward and 
drive performance and to align better the interests of executives 
with those of shareholders. Having last reviewed executive 
remuneration in 2010, the proportion of variable pay in the form of 
annual performance bonus and long-term incentives compared to 
base salary for executive directors was increased in 2010/11 from 
1.3 to 1, to 1.6 to 1 for  on-target' performance, by making increases 
to the expected value of long-term incentive awards. No further 
increase in incentive awards is proposed for 2011/12.
First line reports to the Chief Executive and other senior executives 
are also rewarded within the same overall remuneration policy as 
executive directors, in order to ensure commonality across the group. 
Other executives therefore participate in incentive arrangements 
similar to those of the executive directors, but with lower levels of 
potential payout.
In line with the increases to variable pay for executive directors, from 
the start of 2010/11 the proportion of variable pay to base salary for 
first line executives was increased from around 0.8 to 1, to around  
1 to 1 for  on-target' performance. No further changes to incentive 
yields or structures are proposed for 2011/12. 
Base salary
Base salaries are paid to individuals for delivering a fully competent 
level of performance, and are reviewed in relation to median market 
 
and complexity. Other considerations are individual experience, 
performance and scope of responsibility. Base salaries are normally 
reviewed on an annual basis or following a significant change 
in responsibilities.
Annual performance bonus
Executive directors and other senior executives are eligible to 
participate in an annual cash-based bonus scheme with payments 
based on the achievement of stretching financial targets and 
personal performance assessed against individual short and 
medium-term objectives. Financial targets for all executives are set 
on a business-by-business basis and reflect what can be directly 
influenced and the area of work for which each executive is 
accountable. Adjusted operating profit and working capital were 
chosen as the prime financial measures as they are common 
metrics which are used on a day-to-day basis to drive and monitor 
performance within the group. 
At the start of the financial year, budgeted operating profit is set as 
the  on target' performance level, and the Remuneration committee 
determines the range of operating profit at which minimum and 
maximum incentive payouts will be made. Similarly, the target and 
range for working capital as a percentage of sales is determined at 
the start of the financial year. This metric is used as a multiplier to 
the bonus achieved for adjusted operating profit, whereby that 
bonus can be enhanced or reduced by up to 20%. 
The maximum annual performance bonus opportunity for executive 
directors in 2010/11 was 150% of base salary. Of that 150%, up to 
20% of base salary may be paid for achievement of specific personal 
objectives and up to 130% of base salary may be paid for achievement 
of financial results as outlined above.  On target' performance yields 
a bonus of around 78% of base salary.

Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Directors' report / Governance 
Remuneration report The Remuneration committee regularly reviews the annual 
performance bonus plans for both executive directors and for other 
groups of executives below board level. No changes have been 
made to the arrangements for executive directors since September 
2008. However, from the beginning of 2010/11 the maximum annual 
performance bonus yields for other groups of executives was 
increased by an average of 15% of base salary, so as to ensure that 
remuneration packages remained at a level sufficient to attract and 
retain high-calibre individuals. 
Long-term incentives
Long-term incentives are paid in shares to reward long-term business 
growth and to promote executive retention. The Associated British 
Foods Executive Share Incentive Plan 2003 ( the Share Incentive 
Plan') was established following shareholder approval at the 2003 
annual general meeting. This plan provided for long-term awards  
of up to 150% of base salary to be made in the form of conditional 
allocations of shares, subject to agreed performance targets being 
satisfied over a specified three-year period. 
Since 2006, annual allocations of conditional shares have been made 
to executive directors and other senior executives, thereby creating  
a series of overlapping three-year performance periods. The first 
four allocations to executive directors had a maximum face value  
of 125% of base salary. In December 2010, following agreement 
from shareholders at the annual general meeting, the maximum 
grant level under the Share Incentive Plan was increased to 200%  
of base salary. This increase was to ensure that long-term incentive 
plan opportunities remain competitive and commensurate with  

organisation. For the fifth allocation of shares (2010/13 LTIP), the 
maximum face value for executive directors was 200% of base 
salary. No further changes are planned at the present time.
Group performance for the Share Incentive Plan is measured against 
an absolute range of 5% to 11% compound annual growth in 
adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted earnings per share remains 
the measure chosen for long-term group incentives because:
 it reflects the group's objective of sustained long-term 
earnings growth;
 it is a measure which is well understood both by participants 
and shareholders; 
 it is a published figure with limited adjustments; and
 it encompasses the diverse nature of the group.
An absolute, rather than a relative measure is used as the group is  
a global business for which UK inflation factors are of limited impact. 
Other financial measures have been considered, but found to be 
unhelpful or inappropriate. Measures which require testing against  
a group of companies, for example, relative TSR, are difficult to use 
given the problem of finding appropriate comparator companies. 
Cash flow or return measures have been considered, but these are 
to some extent already encompassed within the earnings per share 
measure, are likely to require many adjustments over a three-year 
period, and may reward volatility and thus detract from a direct 
growth measure. 
For the three financial years from September 2006 to September 
2009 the compound annual growth in adjusted earnings per share 
was 4.27%. As the group target was not met, no shares were 
released to executive directors for the 2006/09 scheme. For the 
three-year performance period ended September 2010, the 
compound annual growth was 10.92%, resulting in a release of 
99.12% of the shares allocated in 2007. Compound annual growth  
in adjusted earnings per share over the past three financial years is 
10.46%. Therefore, in November 2011 executive directors will 
receive 83.8% of the conditional shares allocated in 2008. 
Long-term incentives for executives with divisional responsibility  
are largely measured against adjusted operating profit and working 
capital targets, set by reference to the business for which each 
executive is directly responsible. The long-term share awards for 
these executives therefore depend on the level of performance 
achieved in each business. In 2011, 68 senior executives, excluding 
the executive directors, representing 85% of all eligible participants, 
will receive a release of shares in November.

Incentive Plan are as follows:

Directors' report / Governance 
Remuneration report continued
Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2011 New share grant 
Under the current terms of the Share Incentive Plan, the sixth 
allocation of conditional shares will be made on or after 23 November 
2011 for the performance period September 2011 to September 
2014. The Remuneration committee has reviewed the performance 
criteria and has determined that this allocation will again be measured 
against an absolute range of 5% to 11% compound annual growth in 
adjusted earnings per share. 
In setting long-term targets, the Remuneration committee has taken 
into account the volatility present in many of the markets in which 
the group operates, as well as the scale of investments made in the 
pursuit of long-term growth. The Remuneration committee believes 
that the 5% to 11% compound annual growth range remains 
achievable but stretching over the next three-year period. When  
the LTIP arrangements were amended in 2006 and annual share 
allocations were introduced, the new Share Incentive Plan was 
designed to pay out an average of around 50% of the maximum 
long-term incentive plan opportunity each year over time. Given  
the results of the LTIP scheme to date and the internal forecasts  
for the next few years, the Remuneration committee believes that 
this  on target' expectation is achievable, and should provide a fair 
incentive for executives.
Shareholding requirement 
In 2010, at the same time as approving increases to the maximum 
grant levels under the Share Incentive Plan, the Remuneration 
committee also agreed that those executives who most closely 
influence the sustained long-term growth of the Company should  
be required to demonstrate their commitment to the Company by 
aligning their personal interests to the success of the group and its 
shareholders. Consequently, from the beginning of the 2010/11 
financial year, executive directors and all first line reports to the Chief 
Executive are expected to build up a shareholding in the Company to 
a value at least equal to their pre-tax base salary. In order to achieve 
this target, executives will be required to retain at least 50% of any 
post-tax shares vesting each year from 2013, until such time as the 
appropriate level of shareholding has been reached and then to 
manage their shareholding in such a way as to continue to meet 
the requirement.
Other executives participating in the Share Incentive Plan are now 
encouraged to build up a beneficial interest in the Company, but  
are not required to do so. No further changes are planned at the 
present time.
Share option plans
The Company historically operated two share plans: The Associated 
British Foods plc 1994 Share Option Scheme and The Associated 
British Foods 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme. During the  
year two senior executives exercised options which were 
outstanding under the 2000 Scheme. As at the date of this report  
no share options are held under either of these two schemes. The 
Remuneration committee has reserved the right to grant share 
options under either of these two schemes in special circumstances, 
but there are currently no proposals to award any such share options.
4. Directors' remuneration
Executive directors
Executive directors' salaries were reviewed on 1 December 2010  
in accordance with normal policy. George Weston's salary was 
increased by 4.8% to  915,000 per annum to bring it in line with 
other fully experienced chief executives in similar FTSE 100 
companies. John Bason's salary was increased by 2.7% to 
 602,000 per annum in line with average increases for UK 
executives across the Group. 
Executive directors' salaries are next subject to review on 
1 December 2011.
There will be a below target payout to executive directors in respect 
of the financial element of the annual bonus for the 2010/11 financial 
year. This reflects the performance of the group in a difficult trading 
year when adjusted operating profit was below budgeted expectations. 
The maximum payout opportunity in respect of the personal 
element of the annual bonus is 20% of base salary, around 13%  
of the total annual bonus. Actual bonuses to be paid to each of  
the executive directors for the personal element are based on  
an assessment of their individual performance against specific 
objectives for the 2010/11 financial year. The Remuneration 
committee has determined that George Weston will receive  
a personal element of 13.1% and John Bason 13.5% of base salary  
for this element of the annual bonus.
Executive directors are also entitled to the provision of a fully 
expensed company car, private medical insurance, life assurance, 
home and mobile telephone costs and the reimbursement of 
reasonable business expenses. The taxable value of these benefits 
is included in the table of directors' remuneration on page 52.
Non-executive directors
The board reviews non-executive directors' fees periodically in the 
light of fees payable in comparable companies and the importance 
attached to the retention and attraction of high-calibre individuals as 
non-executive directors. Fees are paid on a per annum basis and are 
not varied for the number of days worked. 
Following a board evaluation and fee review in 2010, fees were 
increased from 1 December 2010. The non-executive Chairman  
is paid an annual fee of  335,000 per annum. The current fee for  
a non-executive director is now  60,000 per annum, and the 
chairman of the Audit committee and the Senior Independent 
Director are each paid an additional fee of  12,500 per annum. 
Non-executive directors receive no other benefits and take no part  
in any discussion or decision concerning their own fees.

5. Directors' pensions
The Remuneration committee aims to ensure that retirement benefits are in line with best practice standards adopted by major companies 
in continental Europe and the United Kingdom.
The Company provides a final salary, defined benefit arrangement for executives who were employed before the scheme was closed to 
new entrants in October 2002. Executives employed after this date benefit from defined contribution arrangements. Both schemes are 
designed to provide retirement benefits of around two thirds of final pensionable salary at normal retirement age and are HM Revenue & 
Customs (HMRC) approved. 
Over the past year the Remuneration committee has been following governmental proposals relating to the taxation of pensions and the 
potential impact that any proposals will have on high earners. Having reviewed the situation, the Company has now introduced flexible 
accrual and contribution options to enable executives to mitigate their tax liabilities. 
The executive directors were both members of the defined benefit scheme, but opted out of this scheme on 5 April 2006, and since then 
have earned benefits in the Employer Financed Retirement Benefit Scheme (EFRBS). The EFRBS is unregistered, but is designed to broadly 
mirror the provisions of the final salary, defined benefit arrangements.
Directors' pension disclosure for year ended 17 September 2011

Notes:
1.  Pension accruals (A) and (C) are the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year, or  
earlier retirement.
2.  The pension values (E), (F) and (G) are transfer values calculated in accordance with Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer Values) 
Regulations 2008. 
3.  The increase in accrued pension net of inflation (B) uses a CPI based inflation figure as opposed to the previous years which were based 
on RPI.
4.  The value of net increase in pension (E) represents the incremental value to the director of his pension benefits during the year, resulting 
from additional service and increases in salary. It is based on the increase in accrued pension net of inflation (B) after deducting the 
director's contribution during the year (D).
5.  Both directors opted out of the ABF Scheme on 5 April 2006, and since then have earned benefits in the Employer Financed Retirement 
Benefit Scheme (EFRBS). The figures shown represent the aggregate of benefits in the ABF Scheme and the EFRBS.
6.  Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
7.  Pension benefits include a 50% spouse's pension. Pensions are guaranteed to increase in line with RPI limited each year to 5% (2.5%  
for benefits accrued post 1 January 2008). Additional discretionary increases to pensions in payment have been granted in the past.
8.  There are no special provisions to provide for unreduced pensions in the case of either early retirement or severance.

Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2011 6. Company's financial results
At close of business on 16 September 2011, the last trading day before the end of the financial year, the market value of the Company's 
ordinary shares was 1118p. During the previous 12 months the price ranged from 940p to 1182p.
7. Performance review
The performance graph illustrates the performance of the Company over the past five years from September 2006 to September 2011,  
in terms of total shareholder return compared with that of the companies comprising the FTSE 100 index. This index has been selected 
because it represents a cross-section of leading UK companies.
8. Directors' service contracts
It is the Company's policy that all executive directors have rolling contracts with 12-month notice periods and that, with the exception  
of Galen Weston, all non-executive directors have rolling contracts with 6-month notice periods. 
The board has not considered it appropriate to enter into a formal letter of appointment with Galen Weston in view of his relationship with 
the ultimate holding company of Associated British Foods plc, Wittington Investments Limited. He receives no fees for performing his role 
as a non-executive director and Associated British Foods plc does not reimburse him for any expenses incurred by him in that role.
The Company's Articles of Association require that all directors retire from office if they have not retired at either of the preceding two 
annual general meetings. In any event, at this year's AGM, all directors are standing for re-election in compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (with the exception of Galen Weston, who has resigned from his role as a non-executive director of the Company 
effective as at the close of the 2011 annual general meeting). Details of the contracts of service of directors who served during the year 
ended 17 September 2011 are set out below:

The Remuneration committee takes the view that the entitlement of the executive directors to 12 months' notice of termination of 
employment is in line with the practice of many comparable companies. Executive directors' service contracts also provide for payment  
in lieu of notice at the Company's discretion.
The Remuneration committee's aim is always to deal fairly with cases of termination whilst taking a robust line in minimising any 
compensation. The Remuneration committee has given due consideration to the recommendations contained in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code regarding inclusion of explicit provisions in directors' service contracts for compensation commitments in the event  
of early termination. The Remuneration committee will continue to keep under review its current practice, which is not to include such 
provisions in order to enable it to respond appropriately to particular circumstances. In such situations, the Remuneration committee  
will consider the appropriate use of mitigation.

Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2011 10. Executive directors serving as non-executive directors
The Remuneration committee has determined that executive 
directors serving as non-executive directors of other companies  
may retain any fees earned.
During the year, George Weston served as a non-executive director 
of Wittington Investments Limited for which he received no 
compensation. John Bason was appointed a non-executive director 
and chairman of the Audit committee of Compass Group plc on 
21 June 2011, for which he received a total fee of  25,000 in the 
2010/11 financial year. He also served as a trustee of Voluntary 
Service Overseas and as deputy chairman of the charity FareShare, 
but received no compensation in respect of either of these roles.
