REMUNERATION REPORT
Introduction
2011/12 was a very good trading year for the group with adjusted 
operating profit and adjusted earnings per share substantially ahead 
of last year. These excellent results have been achieved despite 
some continuing operational challenges and difficult trading 
conditions experienced by one or two of our businesses, as well as 
a non-cash charge of  98m for the impairment of assets in George 
Weston Foods in Australia. 
The performance graph below illustrates the performance of the 
Company over the past five years from September 2007 to September 
2012, in terms of total shareholder return compared with that of the 
companies comprising the FTSE 100 index. This index has been 
selected because it represents a cross-section of leading UK companies.
At close of business on 14 September 2012, the last trading day 
before the end of the financial year, the market value of the Company's 
ordinary shares was 1275p. During the previous 12 months, the 
price ranged from 1069p to 1336p.
The Remuneration committee
The Remuneration committee is responsible to the board for 
determining the remuneration policy for executive directors, together 
with the specific terms and conditions of employment of each individual 
director, and for reviewing the overall policy for executive remuneration. 
The government has announced new remuneration reporting 
proposals, the aim of which is to improve transparency of reporting 
in the area of executive pay and to give shareholders greater power 
over future pay policy. The Remuneration committee welcomes 
these developments and, in the coming year, will be reviewing its 
remuneration practices and reporting in light of these proposed 
reforms. This report has been split into  policy' and  implementation' 
sections to reflect the proposed reforms.
The board has recently reviewed the remit of the Remuneration 
committee. In summary it has agreed that the Remuneration 
committee will: 
 determine and agree the framework or broad policy for the 
remuneration of the Chairman and the executive directors of  
the Company; 
 determine the framework or broad policy for the remuneration 
for the first line and second line reports to the Chief Executive 
and approve individual remuneration decisions when proposed 
arrangements fall outside the broad policy for remuneration;

 ensure that the executive directors and first line and second line 
executives are provided with appropriate, stretching incentives 
to encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair and 
responsible manner, rewarded for their contributions to the 
long-term success of the Company; 
 review the remuneration trends across the Company or group 
when determining the remuneration policy for executive directors; 
 consider and determine all elements of the remuneration of the 
executive directors, receiving advisory information on the same 
in relation to the remuneration of the first line executives;
 approve the design, determine targets for and monitor the operation 
of any performance-related pay schemes operated by the Company, 
and approve total annual payments under such schemes; and
 consider and determine other provisions of the service agreements 
of the executive directors and ensure that contractual terms on 
termination, and any payments made, are fair to the individual and 
the Company and that failure is not rewarded and loss is mitigated. 
Remuneration policy
The overall remuneration policy of the Company aims to:
 provide alignment between remuneration and the Company's 
business objectives;
 align executive rewards with shareholder value;
 attract and retain high-calibre executive directors;
 motivate executive directors to achieve challenging 
performance levels and reward them for so doing;
 recognise both individual and corporate achievement; and
 reflect the diversity of the group's interests.
The remuneration of executive directors is determined by the 
Remuneration committee taking into account group performance, 
individual performance and competitive market practice as well as 
the pay and conditions of the group's UK employees. The total 
annual remuneration of executive directors comprises base salary,  
a cash bonus, shares granted under a long-term incentive scheme, 
pension provisions and other benefits.
The Remuneration committee continues to believe that a substantial 
element of compensation should be  at risk' in order to drive and 
reward performance and to align better the interests of executives 
with those of shareholders. The proportion of variable pay in the 
form of annual performance bonus and long-term incentives 
compared to base salary for executive directors is unchanged at 
around 1.6 to 1 for  on target' performance. No increase in incentive 
awards is proposed for 2012/13.
The composition of the executive directors' remuneration packages 
for  on target' and maximum performance is set out below:

Directors' report | Governance | Remuneration report
First line reports to the Chief Executive and other senior executives are also rewarded broadly within the same overall remuneration policy 
as executive directors, in order to ensure fairness and common purpose across the group. Other executives therefore participate in 
incentive arrangements similar to those of the executive directors, but with lower levels of potential payout. The proportion of variable pay 
to base salary for first line executives is unchanged at around 1 to 1 for  on-target' performance. No changes to incentive yields or structures 
are proposed for 2012/13.
Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed in relation to median market data for comparable companies in terms of size, market sector and complexity. Other 
considerations are individual experience, performance, and scope of responsibility. The committee also receives an annual update from the Group 
HR Director concerning the level of increases awarded to UK employees across the group. Base salaries are normally reviewed on an annual basis 
or following a significant change in responsibilities.
Annual bonus
Executive directors and other senior executives are eligible to participate in an annual cash-based bonus scheme with payments based on 
the achievement of stretching financial targets and personal performance assessed against individual short and medium-term objectives. 
The group comprises a very diverse set of businesses which are required to deliver financial progress over both the short and long term. 
Financial targets for all executives are set on a business-by-business basis and reflect what can be directly influenced and the area of work 
for which each executive is accountable. Adjusted operating profit and working capital were chosen as the prime financial measures as they 
are common metrics which are used across the group on a day-to-day basis to drive and monitor business performance. 
At the start of the financial year, budgeted operating profit is set as the  on target' performance level, and the Remuneration committee 
determines the range of operating profit at which minimum and maximum incentive payouts will be made. Similarly, the target and range for 
average working capital as a percentage of sales is determined at the start of the financial year. This metric is used as a multiplier to the 
bonus achieved for adjusted operating profit, whereby that bonus can be enhanced or reduced by up to 20%.
The maximum annual performance bonus opportunity for executive directors in 2011/12 was 150% of base salary. Of that 150%, up to 
130% of base salary may be paid for achievement of financial results as outlined above, and up to 20% of base salary may be paid for 
achievement of specific personal objectives. Bonuses to be paid to each of the executive directors for the personal element are based  
on an assessment of their individual performance against specific objectives for the appropriate financial year. 
 On target' financial performance will yield a bonus of half the maximum financial payout, and two thirds of the potential personal 
performance element will be deemed  on target', giving an overall total of around 78% of base salary for  on target' performance.
The structure and value of the annual performance bonus is shown below:

Threshold 15.0% x 0.8 12.0% 0.0% 12.0%
The Remuneration committee regularly reviews the annual performance bonus plans for both executive directors and for other groups of 
executives below board level to ensure that remuneration packages remain at a level sufficient to attract and retain high-calibre individuals. 
No changes to annual performance bonus plans are proposed for 2012/13. 
Long-term incentives
Long-term incentives are paid in shares to reward long-term business growth and to promote executive retention. The Associated British 
Foods Executive Share Incentive Plan 2003 ( the Share Incentive Plan') was established following shareholder approval at the 2003 annual 
general meeting. This plan provides for long-term awards to be made in the form of conditional allocations of shares, subject to agreed 
performance targets being satisfied over a specified three-year period.
Since 2006, annual allocations of conditional shares have been made to executive directors and other senior executives, thereby creating  
a series of overlapping three-year performance periods. The first four allocations to executive directors had a maximum face value of 125%  
of base salary. In December 2010, following agreement from shareholders at the annual general meeting, the maximum grant level under 
the Share Incentive Plan was increased to 200% of base salary. This increase was to ensure that long-term incentive plan opportunities 
remained competitive and commensurate with the increased size, complexity and international reach of the organisation. The share 
allocations made to executive directors in 2010 and 2011 were at 200% of base salary. No further changes to the long-term incentive  
plan yields are planned at the present time. 54

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Since 2006 group performance for the Share Incentive Plan has 
been measured against an absolute range of 5% to 11% compound 
annual growth in adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted earnings  
per share remains the measure chosen for long-term group 
incentives because:
 it reflects the group's objective of sustained long-term  
earnings growth;
 it is a measure which is well understood both by participants 
and shareholders;
 it is a published figure with limited adjustments; and
 it encompasses the diverse nature of the group.
An absolute, rather than a relative measure is used, as the group is  
a global business for which UK inflation factors are of limited impact.
Other financial measures have been considered, but found to be 
unhelpful or inappropriate. Measures which require testing against  
a group of companies, for example, relative TSR, are difficult to use 
given the problem of finding appropriate comparator companies. 
Cash flow or return measures have been considered, but these are 
to some extent already encompassed within the earnings per share 
measure, are likely to require many adjustments over a three-year 
period, and may reward volatility and thus detract from a direct 
growth measure.
Under the current terms of the Share Incentive Plan, the sixth allocation 
of conditional shares will be made on or after 23 November 2012 for 
the new performance period September 2012 to September 2015. 
The Remuneration committee has reviewed the performance criteria 
and has determined that this allocation should again be measured 
against an absolute range of 5% to 11% compound annual growth  
in adjusted earnings per share. In setting long-term targets, the 
Remuneration committee has taken into account the volatility 
present in many of the markets in which the group operates, as well 
as the scale of investments made in the pursuit of long-term growth. 
The Remuneration committee believes that the 5% to 11% compound 
annual growth range remains achievable but stretching over the next 
three-year period. 
When the LTIP arrangements were amended in 2006 and annual 
share allocations were introduced, the new Share Incentive Plan  
was designed to pay out an average of around 50% of the maximum 
long-term incentive plan opportunity each year over time. Given the 
results of the LTIP scheme to date, analysts' forecasts and the internal 
forecasts for the next few years, the Remuneration committee 
considers that this  on target' expectation is achievable, and should 
provide a fair but stretching incentive for executives.

Long-term incentives for first and second line executives with 
divisional responsibility are largely measured against adjusted 
operating profit and working capital targets, rather than group 
adjusted earnings per share, and individual business performance 
targets are set at the beginning of each three-year cycle by reference 
to the specific business for which each executive is directly 
responsible. The level of long-term share awards for divisional 
executives therefore depends on the level of performance achieved 
in each business.
Shareholding requirement
In 2010, at the same time as approving increases to the maximum 
grant levels under the Share Incentive Plan, the Remuneration 
committee also agreed that those executives who most closely 
influence the sustained long-term growth of the Company should  
be required to demonstrate their commitment to the Company by 
aligning their personal interests to the success of the group and its 
shareholders. Consequently, from 2013 executive directors and all 
first line reports to the Chief Executive are expected to build and 
maintain a shareholding in the Company to a value at least equal to 
their pre-tax base salary. In order to achieve this target, executives 
will be required to retain at least 50% of any post-tax shares vesting 
each year from 2013, until such time as the appropriate level of 
shareholding has been reached and then to manage their 
shareholding in such a way as to continue to meet the requirement.
Other executives participating in the Share Incentive Plan are now 
encouraged to build up a beneficial interest in the Company, but are 
not required to do so. No further changes are planned at the  
present time.
Pensions
The Remuneration committee aims to ensure that retirement 
benefits are in line with best practice standards adopted by major 
companies in continental Europe and the United Kingdom.
The Company provides a final salary, defined benefit arrangement 
for executives who were employed before the scheme was closed 
to new entrants in October 2002. This scheme is designed to 
provide retirement benefits of around two thirds of final pensionable 
salary at normal retirement age. Executives employed after this date 
benefit from defined contribution arrangements. Both schemes are 
HM Revenue & Customs approved.
Following recent governmental changes regarding the taxation of 
pensions and the potential impact that any proposals would have on 
high earners, the Company introduced flexible accrual and contribution 
options to enable executives to mitigate their tax liabilities.
The executive directors were both members of the defined benefit 
scheme, but opted out of this scheme on 5 April 2006, and since 
then have earned benefits in the Employer Financed Retirement 
Benefit Scheme (EFRBS). The EFRBS is unregistered, but is 
designed to broadly mirror the provisions of the final salary,  
defined benefit arrangements.
Benefits
Executive directors are also entitled to the provision of a fully 
expensed company car, private medical insurance, life assurance, 
home and mobile telephone costs and the reimbursement of 
reasonable business expenses.  55

Remuneration of non-executive directors
The board reviews non-executive directors' fees periodically in the light of fees payable in comparable companies and the importance 
attached to the retention and attraction of high-calibre individuals as non-executive directors. Fees are paid on a per annum basis and are 
not varied for the number of days worked. Non-executive directors receive no other benefits and take no part in any discussion or decision 
concerning their own fees.
Fees for both the Chairman and other non-executive directors were last increased on 1 December 2010, and will be reviewed again on  
1 December 2012. 
Directors' service contracts
It is the Company's policy that all executive directors have rolling contracts with 12 month notice periods and that, (with the exception of 
Galen Weston who retired as a director on 9 December 2011), all non-executive directors have rolling contracts with 6 month notice periods.
The Company's Articles of Association require that all directors retire from office if they have not retired at either of the preceding two 
annual general meetings. In any event, at this year's AGM, all directors are standing for re-election in compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 
Details of the contracts of service of directors who served during the year ended 15 September 2012 are set out below:

Peter Smith 28.02.07 28.02.07 6 months 6 months Rolling contract
Emma Adamo 09.12.11 09.12.11 6 months 6 months Rolling contract
The Remuneration committee takes the view that the entitlement of the executive directors to 12 months' notice of termination of 
employment is in line with the practice of many comparable companies. Executive directors' service contracts also provide for payment  
in lieu of notice at the Company's discretion.
The Remuneration committee's aim is always to deal fairly with cases of termination whilst taking a robust line in minimising any 
compensation and ensuring that failure is not rewarded. The Remuneration committee has given due consideration to the 
recommendations contained in the UK Corporate Governance Code regarding inclusion of explicit provisions in directors' service contracts 
for compensation commitments in the event of early termination. The Remuneration committee will continue to keep under review its 
current practice, which is not to include such provisions in order to enable it to respond appropriately to particular circumstances. In such 
situations, the Remuneration committee will consider the appropriate use of mitigation. 
Executive directors serving as non-executive directors
The Remuneration committee has determined that executive directors serving as non-executive directors of other companies may retain 
any fees earned. 56

Remuneration committee composition
The Remuneration committee currently consists of five non-executive directors. The members of the committee who held office during  
the year and at the date of this report are:
Charles Sinclair (Chairman)
Tim Clarke (Senior Independent Director)
Lord Jay
Javier Ferr n
Peter Smith
The committee met on five occasions during the year.
Consultants
The Remuneration committee has retained Towers Watson to provide independent market information and remuneration advice. Towers 
Watson does not provide any other consulting services to the Company. In addition to Towers Watson, the following people provided 
material advice or services to the committee during the year:
George Weston, Chief Executive
Des Pullen, Group HR Director
George Weston did not advise in respect of his own remuneration. The Group HR Director and Towers Watson provided support and 
liaison throughout the year.
Base salary
Executive directors' salaries were reviewed on 1 December 2011 in accordance with normal policy. The salaries of George Weston and 
John Bason were both increased by around 3.8% in line with average increases for UK executives across the group. George Weston's 
salary is now  950,000 per annum and John Bason's salary is  625,000 per annum.
Executive directors' salaries are next subject to review on 1 December 2012.
Annual bonus
There will be a payout of 78.3% of salary to executive directors in respect of the financial element of the annual bonus for the 2011/12 financial 
year. This reflects the very strong performance of the group when adjusted operating profit was well above expectations, although the working 
capital performance lowered the potential payout of the financial element of the bonus by around 15.5%. 
Following a review of individual performance against specific objectives for the 2011/12 financial year, the Remuneration committee has 
determined that George Weston will receive 12.65% and John Bason 14.5% of base salary for the personal element of the annual bonus.  
These percentage awards both represent good overall performance with major objectives having been achieved.
Long-term incentives
For the three-year performance period ended September 2011 the compound annual growth in adjusted earnings per share was 10.46%, 
resulting in a release of 83.8% of the shares allocated in November 2008.

For the three-year performance period ended September 2012, the compound annual growth in adjusted earnings per share was 14.76%. 
The Remuneration committee has, however, determined that as a result of the asset impairment charge of  98m in the 2012 financial 
statements in connection with the Don KRC business, it would be appropriate for them to apply their discretion under the Share Incentive 
Plan to reduce the vesting proportion from 100% to 97.42%. Therefore, in November 2012 executive directors will receive 97.42% of the 
conditional shares allocated in 2009.
As long-term incentives for executives with divisional responsibility are largely measured against adjusted operating profit and working 
capital targets, set by reference to the business for which each executive is directly responsible, the long-term share awards for these 
executives depend on the level of performance achieved in each business. In 2012, 55 senior executives, excluding the executive directors, 
representing 77.5% of all eligible participants, will receive a release of shares in November. 57

Notes:
1.  Pension accruals (A) and (C) are the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year,  
or earlier retirement.
2.  The pension values (E), (F) and (G) are transfer values calculated in accordance with Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer Values) 
Regulations 2008.
3.  The increase in accrued pension net of inflation (B) uses a CPI based inflation figure as opposed to previous years which were based  
on RPI.
4.  The value of net increase in pension (E) represents the incremental value to the director of his pension benefits during the year, resulting 
from additional service and increases in salary. It is based on the increase in accrued pension net of inflation (B) after deducting the 
director's contribution during the year (D).
5.  The change in the transfer value (H) includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the 
Company and directors, such as stock market movements. The directors' contributions during the year are excluded from this value.
6.  Both directors opted out of the ABF Scheme on 5 April 2006, and since then have earned benefits in the Employer Financed Retirement 
Benefit Scheme (EFRBS). The figures shown represent the aggregate of benefits in the ABF Scheme and the EFRBS.
7.  Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
8.  Pension benefits include a 50% spouse's pension. Pensions are guaranteed to increase in line with RPI limited each year to 5% (2.5%  
for benefits accrued post 1 January 2008). Additional discretionary increases to pensions in payment have been granted in the past.
9.  As in previous years the directors' contributions during the period (D) recognises the amount of salary sacrifice made by the directors  
in lieu of paying contributions. Both directors  contribute' 15% of the scheme-specific salary cap so the amount is the same for both. 58
