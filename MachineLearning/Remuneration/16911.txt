 Annual statement by the Remuneration 
Committee Chairman
Associated British Foods is a group of businesses that trade all 
over the world, both in international and domestic markets. That 
diversity extends to size, margin, growth rates and returns, as 
well as to products. Businesses are expected to grow in the 
long term, but are subject to short-term pressures which 
prevent this from time to time. Recent years have seen strong 
overall growth from the group and the remuneration achieved  
by directors and many managers has reflected that. Given the 
diversity of the group, growth does not occur uniformly across 
all businesses in every year and we know that one of our bigger 
businesses, European Sugar, will come under pressure in 
coming years. However, to achieve its strategic objectives  
ABF is always willing to invest for the long term, where 
necessary at the expense of annual results. 
The committee's approach to remuneration is that it should  
be kept as simple as possible. Our practice is to ensure that 
remuneration directly reflects individual accountabilities for 
business results. We seek to reward at the median of the 
relevant market, and we believe that pay should be managed 
fairly, given the importance of long-term profit development 
over short-term results. Our framework for executive 
remuneration is based on a set of guiding principles, such as a 
belief in  line of sight' and  doing the right thing'. This framework 
has been largely unchanged for a number of years. The two 
executive directors are an integral part of a flat pyramid of 
management whose remuneration is dealt with in a consistent 
manner. The only change to be made in the new financial year 
will be the replacement, if approved, of the current share plan 
which comes to the end of its ten-year term in December. 
One of ABF's strategic objectives is to deliver long-term growth 
in earnings which makes earnings per share the natural measure 
of performance over the long term. The committee debates 
each year the appropriate range of growth which should 
properly incentivise and reward directors and management in 
the long term and also whether, and to what extent, targets 
should be flexed to accommodate unexpected events which 
disrupt short-term plans and alter longer-term outcomes. These 
debates are rarely easy to resolve but are usually determined  
by reference to the individual's accountability for the business, 
whether the event was beyond the individual's control and 
whether actions taken were in the long-term interests of the 
business. As a matter of fact, discretion on fairness issues is 
often debated but only used in limited circumstances.
As chairman of the committee, I invite the larger institutional 
shareholders each year to discuss their views on the group's 
remuneration, along with strategy and governance. Those who 
have taken up the invitation over the past year have expressed 
confidence with the way in which the group has managed 
remuneration, and discussion has been characterised by informed 
enquiry and open debate. Remuneration is one of those subjects 
on which every shareholder has a point of view. I hope that our 
principles of clarity, relative simplicity, accountability and fairness 
help to explain what the committee does and enable 
shareholders to support the committee's work.

Remuneration Committee Chairman
Remuneration policy
Role of the committee in relation to remuneration policy
The Remuneration committee is responsible to the board for 
determining the remuneration policy for executive directors, 
together with the specific terms and conditions of employment 
of each individual director, and for reviewing the overall policy  
for executive remuneration. 
The Remuneration committee has reviewed its remuneration 
practices and reporting in light of the government's new 
remuneration reporting reforms. These reforms come into 
operation for financial years ending on or after 30 September  
2013 and so will not become effective for the group until 2014. 
In the meantime the committee has decided to make a number 
of substantial changes to the 2013 Remuneration report in order 
to provide shareholders with additional information about the 
remuneration of directors and rewards for Company performance. 
In summary, the remit of the Remuneration committee is to: 
 	 determine and agree the framework or broad policy for the 
remuneration of the executive directors and the Chairman  
of the Company (in his absence); 
 	 determine the framework or broad policy for the remuneration 
for the first line and second line reports to the Chief Executive 
and approve individual remuneration decisions when 
proposed arrangements fall outside the broad policy for 
remuneration; 
 	 ensure that the executive directors and first line and second 
line executives are provided with appropriate, stretching 
incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are,  
in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their 
contributions to the long-term success of the Company; 
 	 review the remuneration trends across the Company  
or group when determining the remuneration policy for 
executive directors; 
 	 consider and determine all elements of the remuneration  
of the executive directors, receiving advisory information  
on the same in relation to the remuneration of the first 
line executives;
 	 approve the design and monitor the operation of any  
Company share plans; and
 	 consider and determine other provisions of the service 
agreements of the executive directors and ensure that 
contractual terms on termination, and any payments made, 
are fair to the individual and the Company and that failure  
is not rewarded and loss is mitigated. 
The committee will apply discretion, where necessary  
and by exception, to ensure that there are no unintended 
consequences from the operation of the remuneration policy. 
The committee exercised discretion in 2012 for the first time  
in many years, when it determined that as a result of an 
exceptional asset impairment charge it would be appropriate  
to reduce the vesting under the Executive Share Incentive  
Plan. This year, the committee has again exercised discretion  
in order to reflect the underperformance of investments in a 
particular sector.

REMUNERATION REPORT In setting the remuneration policy, the committee seeks to act 
in the best interests of the Company. The committee chairman 
engages with a number of our largest shareholders to understand 
any concerns they may have about the approach to remuneration. 
Whilst the views of employees are not explicitly sought, employees 
are able to feed back their opinions through employee opinion 
surveys or directly to the Company's management. 
Executive directors
The overall remuneration policy of the Company aims to:
 	 provide alignment between remuneration and the Company's 
business objectives;
 	 align executive rewards with shareholder value;
 	 attract and retain high-calibre executive directors;
 	 motivate executive directors to achieve challenging 
performance levels and reward them for so doing;
 	 recognise both individual and group achievement; and
 	 reflect the diversity of the group's interests.
The remuneration of executive directors is determined by  
the Remuneration committee taking into account group 
performance, individual performance and competitive market 
practice as well as the pay and conditions of the group's UK 
employees. The total annual remuneration of executive directors 
comprises base salary, a cash bonus, shares granted under  
a long-term incentive scheme, pension provisions and 
other benefits.
The Remuneration committee continues to believe that a 
substantial element of compensation should be  at risk' in  
order to drive and reward performance and to align better  
the interests of executives with those of shareholders. The 
proportion of variable pay in the form of annual performance 
bonus and long-term incentives compared to base salary for 
executive directors is around 1.8 to 1 for  on target' performance 
and 3.5 to 1 for maximum performance. No increase in incentive 
awards is proposed for 2013/14.
For 2012/13, the composition of the executive directors' 
remuneration packages for fixed, threshold,  on target' and 
maximum performance is set out below:

Base salary
To provide core 
reward for the role.
Base salaries are normally reviewed on an annual basis or following  
a significant change in responsibilities. 
Salaries are reviewed in relation to median market data for comparable 
companies in terms of size, market sector and complexity. The 
committee also receives an annual update from the Group HR Director 
concerning the level of increases awarded to UK employees across 
the group. 
The committee considers the impact of any base salary increase on  
the total remuneration package. 
Annual review of 
base salary with 
increase in line 
with other UK 
executives across 
the group.
Annual performance bonus
To encourage and 
reward the attainment 
of challenging 
financial targets and 
the achievement of 
personal performance 
objectives over a 
one-year period.
Group financial performance is assessed against adjusted operating 
profit and average working capital as a percentage of sales. 
These metrics have been chosen because they are prime financial 
measures used across the whole group on a day-to-day basis to drive 
and monitor performance.
Targets are set at the start of each financial year. Budgeted adjusted 
operating profit is positioned as the  on target' performance level, and 
the Remuneration committee determines the range of operating profit 
at which minimum and maximum incentive payouts will be made. 
Similarly, the target and range for average working capital as a 
percentage of sales is determined at the start of the financial year.  
This metric is used as a multiplier to the bonus achieved for adjusted 
operating profit, whereby that bonus can be enhanced or reduced by  
up to 20%. 
In the event of unusual or unforeseen circumstances occurring after 
budgets have been set, the Remuneration committee retains discretion 
to make adjustments, up or down, to respond to events and to 
encourage executives to make the right business decisions regardless 
of timing or the effect on incentives.
Individual personal objectives are also set each year. These may be 
specific short-term goals or milestones towards medium or long-term 
objectives, but are closely aligned to the overall strategy of the group. 
Following the end of the financial year, the Chairman reviews the 
performance of the Chief Executive against these objectives and  
makes a recommendation to the Remuneration committee about the 
appropriate level of payout for the personal element. Similarly, the Chief 
Executive makes a recommendation to the Remuneration committee 
regarding the Finance Director following an assessment  
of his performance.
The structure and value of the overall annual bonus is as follows:

as it is a discretionary scheme and the committee retains the discretion 
to reduce or cancel payments.

Long-term incentives
To reward long-term 
business growth, 
promote executive 
retention and align  
the interests of 
executives and 
shareholders.
Executive directors are eligible to participate in the Associated  
British Foods Executive Share Incentive Plan 2003 (the  Share  
Incentive Plan'). The plan provides for annual allocations of  
conditional shares, which vest over a three-year period, subject  
to agreed performance targets being satisfied. 
Under the terms of the current Share Incentive Plan, an allocation  
of conditional shares will be made on or after 25 November 2013 for  
the new performance period September 2013 to September 2016. 
Measures
Group performance is measured against an absolute range of 
compound annual growth in adjusted earnings per share (eps). 
This measure was chosen because it:
 	 	 r efl ec ts	 the 	 gr oup ' s 	 o bjec tiv e 	 of 	 s ust ained 	 long - t er m 	 ear n ings	
growth;
 	 	 is 	 a 	 meas ur e 	 w h ich 	 is 	 wel l 	 underst o o d 	 b o th 	 b y 	 p ar ticip an ts	
and shareholders;
 	 is 	 a 	 publ is hed 	 fi gur e	 with 	 l i m it ed 	 adj ustmen ts ; 	 and
 	 	 enc omp asses 	 the 	 div erse 	 na t ur e 	 of 	 the 	 gr oup .
An absolute, rather than a relative measure is used, as the group is  
a 	 glob al 	 bus i ness 	 f or 	 wh ich 	 UK 	 i nfl a tion	 fac t ors 	 ar e 	 of 	 l imit ed 	 imp ac t.
Other financial measures have been considered, but found to be 
unhelpful or inappropriate. Measures which require testing against a 
group of companies, for example, relative TSR, are difficult to use given 
the 	 pr oblem 	 of 	 findi ng	 ap pr opria t e 	 c omp ara t or 	 c omp an ies. 	 C ash 	 fl o w	 or 	
return measures have been considered, but these are to some extent 
already encompassed within the earnings per share measure, are likely 
to require many adjustments over a three-year period, and may reward 
volatility and thus detract from a direct growth measure.
Targets
Targets are set by the committee at the beginning of each three-year 
performance period, taking into account the state of the markets in 
which the group operates as well as the scale of investments made  
in the pursuit of long-term growth. 
The Share Incentive Plan was designed to pay out an average of  
around 50% of the maximum long-term incentive plan opportunity each 
year over time. In determining a fair but stretching target, the committee 
also considers the results of the long-term incentive scheme to date, 
market expectations and internal forecasts for the next few years.

Long-term incentives continued
New plan
The  Associated British Foods Executive Share Incentive Plan 2003' is  
a ten-year-plan which expires in December 2013, so a new  Associated 
British Foods Long Term Incentive Plan' will be put to shareholders for 
approval at the 2013 annual general meeting. If approved, any share 
allocations made after 6 December 2013 will be made under the  
terms of the new plan. 
Conditional shares already allocated for the three-year performance 
periods 2010-13, 2011-14, 2012-15 and 2013-16 will vest under the 
terms of the Executive Share Incentive Plan 2003. 
Shareholding requirement
To demonstrate 
commitment to the 
Company by aligning 
personal interests to 
the success of the 
group and its 
shareholders.
Executive directors are required to build and maintain a shareholding  
in the Company to a value at least equal to their pre-tax base salary. In 
order to achieve this target, from the beginning of the 2013/14 financial 
year executives will be required to retain at least 50% of any post-tax 
shares vesting each year, until such time as the appropriate level of 
shareholding has been reached and then to manage their shareholding 
in such a way as to continue to meet the requirement.
Expectation  
to build 
shareholding.
Pension
To provide a 
competitive 
retirement benefit in 
line with best practice 
standards adopted by 
major companies in 
the United Kingdom 
and continental 
Europe.
The Company provides a final salary, defined benefit arrangement  
for executives who were employed before the scheme was closed  
to new entrants in October 2002. The scheme is designed to provide 
retirement benefits of around two-thirds of final pensionable salary at 
normal retirement age. John Bason has a two-thirds promise at age 62. 
Executives employed after October 2002 benefit from a defined 
contribution arrangement, with a Company contribution of 25%  
of base salary. 
Both pension schemes are HM Revenue & Customs approved.
Following governmental changes regarding the taxation of pensions  
and the potential impact that any proposals would have on high earners, 
the 	 C omp an y 	 i n tr o duced 	 fl e xible	 accrual 	 and 	 c on tribution 	 o p tions 	 t o 	
enable executives to mitigate their tax liabilities.
Where a UK-based pension arrangement is not possible, or is not tax 
efficient, a cash supplement equivalent to the normal company pension 
contribution may be paid in lieu.
The current executive directors were both members of the defined 
benefit scheme, but opted out of this scheme on 5 April 2006, and 
since then have earned benefits in the Employer Financed Retirement 
Benefit Scheme (EFRBS). The EFRBS is unregistered, but is designed 
to broadly mirror the provisions of the final salary defined benefit 
arrangements. 
Company contribution 
for senior executives 
under the ABF DC 
scheme is a 
maximum of 25%  
of base salary.
None.

Benefits
To provide a 
competitive and

benefits package 
appropriate to  
role and location.
The benefits provided include, but are not limited to, death in service 
payment, permanent health insurance, company car plus private fuel, 
family healthcare and, where relevant, fees to maintain professional 
memberships. Executives are also provided with the technology  
that they require to efficiently and effectively carry out their roles.
In addition to the above, if a new executive director were to relocate 
from another country, additional support would be provided. The nature 
of this potential ongoing support is detailed in the recruitment and 
promotion arrangements section below.
As for other employees, we reimburse executives for expenses 
necessarily incurred in the normal course of business.
None.
Recruitment and promotion arrangements
To secure the 
appointment or 
promotion of 
high-calibre  
executive directors.
Salary
Starting salary will be based on a combination of market information, 
internal relativities and individual experience. Thereafter, salary 
progression will depend on the initial agreed base salary and the  
normal review process.
Variable pay
(i) For external appointments 
The Company may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements 
when it considers these to be in the best interest of the Company. Such 
payments would take account of the remuneration relinquished when 
leavi ng 	 a 	 f ormer 	 emplo y er 	 and 	 w ould 	 r efl ec t	 the 	 na t ur e , 	 time 	 hori z ons	
and performance requirements attaching to that remuneration.
Where existing incentive or other arrangements are being bought out, 
this will be done wherever possible by tying in any new arrangement  
to achievement against group targets in either/both the annual 
performance bonus and long-term incentives.
Annual performance bonus
If appropriate, some level of bonus, particularly during the first year  
in post, may be guaranteed in order to encourage the executive to 
move. This underpinning may be used as part of a buyout of existing 
arrangements.
Long-term incentives 
As shares under the normal long-term incentive scheme will not be 
released for up to three years, some cash-based interim long-term 
arrangement may be provided, but the level will not be more than 
would otherwise have been paid. This may be used as part of the 
buyout of existing arrangements.
(ii) For internal appointments
Any variable pay elements awarded in respect of the prior role may be 
allowed to pay out according to the terms of the scheme, adjusted as 
relevant to take account of the new appointment. In addition, any other 
ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment 
may continue.
Maximum level of 
ongoing variable pay 
will be in line with 
normal policy.

expected to rent out their family home to offset the additional cost

School fees 
The Company will consider paying school fees for dependent children 
of an executive director in cases where there are cultural or language 
requirements.
Flights home
Where an executive is recruited from outside the UK the Company  
will pay for one business class return fare per annum each for the 
executive, his/her partner and dependent children in order to  
maintain family or other links with his/her home country.
Retention arrangements
To allow the Company 
to retain top executive 
talent.
The Remuneration committee seeks to reward executives within  
its agreed remuneration framework or broad policy. However, in 
exceptional circumstances the committee may agree an additional  
ad hoc cash payment in order to respond to the potential loss of 
executive talent. 
Executive directors serving as non-executive directors
To encourage 
self-development  
and allow for the 
introduction of 
external insight  
and practice.
The Remuneration committee has determined that, with the consent  
of the Chairman, executive directors may serve as non-executive 
directors of other companies in an individual capacity and will retain  
any fees earned. 
Comparison of remuneration policy for executive directors and executives below the board
Whilst the Company is not required to disclose how the pay of executive directors compares with that of those below the board,  
we believe that it is helpful to set their pay in a wider context. First line reports to the Chief Executive and other senior executives  
are rewarded broadly within the same overall remuneration policy as executive directors, in order to ensure fairness and common 
purpose across the group. Other executives therefore participate in incentive arrangements similar to those of the executive 
directors, but with lower levels of potential payout. The proportion of variable pay to base salary for first line executives is around  
1.2 to 1 for  on-target' performance and 2.25 to 1 for maximum performance. 
Annual bonus
The group comprises a very diverse set of businesses which are required to deliver financial progress over both the short and long 
term. Financial targets for all executives are set on a business-by-business basis reflecting our  line of sight' principle, i.e. what can 
be directly influenced and the area of work for which each executive is accountable. Adjusted operating profit and working capital  
are used as the prime financial measures across all businesses as they are common metrics which are used across the whole  
group on a day-to-day basis to drive and monitor business performance.
68
 Directors' report | Governance | Remuneration report
Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2013
REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED The Remuneration committee regularly reviews the annual performance bonus plans for other groups of senior executives below 
board level to ensure that remuneration packages remain at a level sufficient to attract and retain high-calibre individuals. 
Long-term incentives
Senior executives below board level are also eligible to receive conditional share allocations under the Share Incentive Plan. 
Executives with divisional responsibility are largely measured against adjusted operating profit and working capital targets, rather 
than group adjusted earnings per share, and individual business performance targets are set at the beginning of each three-year 
cycle by reference to the specific business for which each executive is directly responsible. Again this reflects our  line of sight' 
principle. The actual level of long-term share awards received by divisional executives therefore depends on the level of performance 
achieved in each business. 
In unusual circumstances, where realistic three-year targets cannot be set (for example where there is exceptional business 
discontinuity or in a business recovery situation), an alternative mechanism may be used to calculate long-term achievement or 
consistent progress against shorter-term goals. This alternative process, the  Accumulator', determines the appropriate level of share 
award to be paid over the normal performance period by averaging the actual financial performance achieved in each of the three 
years of the LTIP period. The Accumulator is used very selectively and its use is agreed on a year-by-year basis. 
Shareholding requirement
The Remuneration committee believes that all those executives who most closely influence the sustained long-term growth of the 
Company should be required to demonstrate their commitment to the Company by aligning their personal interests to the success 
of the group and its shareholders. Consequently, from 2013 all first line reports to the Chief Executive are expected to build and 
maintain a shareholding in the Company to a value at least equal to their pre-tax base salary. 
Other executives participating in the Share Incentive Plan are also encouraged to build up a beneficial interest in the Company,  
but are not required to do so. No further changes are planned at the present time.
Summary of remuneration policy for non-executive directors
The board reviews non-executive directors' fees periodically in the light of fees payable in comparable companies and the 
importance attached to the retention and attraction of high-calibre individuals as non-executive directors. Fees are paid on a per 
annum basis and are not varied for the number of days worked. Non-executive directors receive no other benefits and take no part  
in any discussion or decision concerning their own fees.
The Remuneration committee (under the chairmanship of the Senior Independent Director) reviews the Chairman's fees. In addition 
to his fee, the Chairman also receives private medical insurance for himself and his spouse. 
Fees for both the Chairman and other non-executive directors were last increased on 1 December 2012.

The Company's Articles of Association require that all directors retire from office if they have not retired at either of the preceding 
two annual general meetings. In any event, at this year's annual general meeting, all directors are standing for re-election in 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. Contracts are available for inspection at the Company's offices. Contracts and 
service agreements are not reissued when base salaries or fees are changed. Pension arrangements for both the current executive 
directors have also been amended, as described in the policy table, without reissuing their contracts. 
Executive directors' service contracts and provisions relating to their termination
Notice periods Executive directors have rolling contracts with 12-month notice periods. 
The Remuneration committee takes the view that this arrangement is in line with the practice of many comparable 
companies. 
Pay in lieu Executive directors' service contracts also provide for payment in lieu of notice at the Company's discretion. 
Appointments may be terminated with immediate effect and (except in the case of gross misconduct), in lieu  
of the unexpired notice period, payments may be made in monthly instalments or as a lump sum as appropriate.
Pension and benefits The Company may also make a series of monthly payments in respect of benefits and pension provision (or at the 
Company's discretion, a lump sum). Any monthly payments would be reduced to take account of amounts received 
from alternative employment in line with the mitigation provisions.
Annual bonus There is no automatic entitlement to accrued bonus on termination. If an executive director ceases to be employed 
before, or is under notice when, the results for the financial year are published, then no award will be made unless 
the committee determines otherwise. It is not our intention to make any payments in circumstances that amount to 
 payment for failure', but in cases of redundancy, ill health, permanent disability, death in service or retirement with 
the agreement of the Company, the committee will consider making a payment for the financial year in which the 
termination took place. Any agreed payment will be made in the December following the year end. 
Long-term incentive If an executive director leaves the Company due to dismissal or resignation prior to the date when shares are due to 
vest, all conditional share awards will be cancelled and no shares granted for any of the long-term incentive plans in 
operation. There will be no contractual right to these shares or any cash equivalent.
If the executive leaves the Company due to retirement with the agreement of the Company, redundancy, permanent 
disability or death in service, consideration will be given to releasing shares at the normal release date for any LTIP 
which is due to mature during that year. In such cases, grants will be subject to normal performance calculations at 
year end and will be prorated for length of service in completed months during the three-year period of the LTIP. Such 
consideration will be at the discretion of the Remuneration committee. All LTIPs which are not due to mature during 
the year will lapse.
Repatriation Except in a case of gross misconduct, where an executive has been recruited from overseas and has been relocated 
to the UK at the start of his/her employment, the Company will pay for his/her repatriation. 
Mitigation The Remuneration committee's aim is always to deal fairly with cases of termination whilst taking a robust line in 
minimising any compensation and ensuring that failure is not rewarded. 
The Remuneration committee has given due consideration to the recommendations contained in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code regarding inclusion of explicit provisions in directors' service contracts for compensation 
commitments in the event of early termination. The Remuneration committee will continue to keep under review its 
current practice, which is not to include such provisions in order to enable it to respond appropriately to particular 
circumstances. In such situations, the Remuneration committee will consider the appropriate use of mitigation.
Annual report on remuneration
Remuneration committee members
The Remuneration committee currently comprises five non-executive directors. The members of the committee who held office 
during the year and at the date of this report were:
Charles Sinclair Chairman
Tim Clarke Senior Independent Director
Peter Smith Chairman of Audit committee
Lord Jay
Javier Ferr n
The committee met on six occasions during the year and all members were present at each of the meetings.
Remuneration committee advisors and fees
Following a competitive tender in 2003, Towers Watson (then Towers Perrin) was selected to provide independent market 
information and remuneration advice to the Remuneration committee. The committee has retained Towers Watson in this role 
because it values continuity of advice over the long term and the robust data provided. The committee remains satisfied that the 
advice from Towers Watson is independent, thoughtful and challenging.

At the last AGM in December 2012 the voting results on the remuneration resolution  To receive and approve the directors' 
Remuneration report for the year ended 15 September 2012' were as follows:
(i) the total number of votes cast in relation to the resolution was 652,929,365 - 644,285,996  for' and 8,643,369  against'

TSR performance and Chief Executive's pay
The performance graph below illustrates the performance of the Company over the past five years from September 2008 to 
September 2013, in terms of total shareholder return compared with that of the companies comprising the FTSE 100 index.  
This index has been selected because it represents a cross-section of leading UK companies. 
In addition, the graph provides a five-year summary of the total remuneration of the Group Chief Executive over the same period 
showing a breakdown of each of the elements of variable pay within the total remuneration figure. For the purpose of calculating  
the value of the remuneration of the Group Chief Executive, data has been collated on a basis consistent with the  single figure' 
methodology as defined by the Department for Business Innovation & Skills. 
At close of business on 13 September 2013, the last trading day before the end of the financial year, the market value of the 
Company's ordinary shares was 1809p. During the previous 12 months, the market value ranged from 1284p to 2031p.
Comparison of the Group Chief Executive's remuneration with the remuneration of other employees and  
other Company measures
Associated British Foods is very geographically dispersed and therefore subject to very different pay markets, so it is difficult to 
make sensible comparisons with all employees across the group. As indicated previously, the salaries of executive directors are 
reviewed in line with UK executives and in December 2012, when the target salary increase for all executives was between  
2.5% and 3.0%, the Chief Executive received a salary increase of 2.84%.

 Directors' report | Governance | Remuneration report
Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2013 In order to drive and reward performance, and to align better the interests of executives and shareholders, the executive directors 
have a greater proportion of their total reward package at risk than other employees. This means that in years of very good 
performance, the Chief Executive's package increases more than that of most other employees. However it should be noted that 
the LTIP portion of the Chief Executive's 2012/13 total remuneration reflects a 75% share price appreciation over the past three-year 
period, a benefit shared by other shareholders.

Annual bonus
In December 2013 there will be a payout of 112.23% of salary to executive directors in respect of the financial element of the annual 
bonus for the 2012/13 financial year. This reflects the very strong performance of the group with adjusted operating profit above 
expectations and working capital as a percentage of sales also ahead of target:

 No discretion was applied in relation to the incentive outcomes detailed above.
Following a review of individual performance against specific objectives for the 2012/13 financial year in accordance with the  
normal policy, the Remuneration committee has determined that George Weston will receive 12.5% and John Bason 13.5% of base 
salary for the personal element of the annual bonus. Individual objectives set for each of the executive directors were closely aligned 
to the overall strategy of the group and will not be disclosed because of the commercial sensitivity. These percentage awards both 
represent good overall performance with major objectives or milestones having been attained, although some minor objectives 
were not achieved.
Long-term incentives
For the three-year performance period ended September 2012, the compound annual growth in adjusted earnings per share was 
14.76%, against a target range of 5% to 11%. The Remuneration committee determined that as a result of an exceptional asset 
impairment charge it would be appropriate for them to apply their discretion under the Executive Share Incentive Plan 2003 to 
reduce the vesting proportion from 100% to 97.42%. Therefore, executive directors received 97.42% of the conditional shares 
allocated in 2009.
For the three-year performance period ended September 2013, the compound annual growth in adjusted earnings per share  
was 11.06%, against a target range of 5% to 11%. However, the committee has again decided to exercise its discretion under the 
Executive Share Incentive Plan 2003 and has reduced the share vesting from 100% to 85% in order to reflect the underperformance 
of investments in the Ingredients businesses. 
In November 2013 executive directors will therefore receive 85% of the conditional shares allocated in 2010 - George Weston will 
receive 137,928 shares and John Bason 92,584 shares.

The Remuneration committee has recently reviewed the long-term incentive plan performance targets and has determined that for 
the 2013-16 performance period, allocations should again be measured against an absolute range of 5% to 11% compound annual 
growth in adjusted earnings per share. In setting this target, the Remuneration committee has taken into account the volatility 
present in many of the markets in which the group operates, as well as the scale of investments made in the pursuit of long-term 
growth. The committee believes that the 5% to 11% compound annual growth range remains achievable but stretching over the 
next three-year period. 
As far as other participants are concerned, long-term incentives for executives with divisional responsibility are largely measured 
against adjusted operating profit and working capital targets, set by reference to the business for which each executive is directly 
responsible in accordance with our  line of sight' principle. The level of share awards for these executives therefore depends on  
the level of performance achieved in each business. In November 2012, 55 senior executives, excluding the executive directors 
(77.5% of all eligible participants), received a release of shares.
This year, 58 senior executives, excluding the executive directors, (80.6% of all eligible participants) will receive a release of shares  
in November 2013.
Shareholding requirement
The requirement for executive directors and all first line reports to the Chief Executive to build up a shareholding in the Company  
to a value at least equal to their pre-tax base salary will come into force in 2013. At the date of this report, both George Weston  
and John Bason are already fully compliant with this requirement.

Notes:
1.  Pension accruals (A) and (C) are the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year, 
or earlier retirement.
2.  The pension values (E), (F) and (G) are transfer values calculated in accordance with Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer 
Values) Regulations 2008.
3.  The increase in accrued pension net of inflation (B) uses a CPI based inflation figure.
4.  The value of net increase in pension (E) represents the incremental value to the director of his pension benefits during the year, 
resulting from additional service and increases in salary. It is based on the increase in accrued pension net of inflation (B) after 
deducting the director's contribution during the year (D).
5.  The change in the transfer value (H) includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the 
Company and directors, such as stock market movements. The directors' contributions during the year are excluded from this value.
6.  Both directors opted out of the ABF Scheme on 5 April 2006, and since then have earned benefits in the Employer Financed 
Retirement Benefit Scheme (EFRBS). The figures shown represent the aggregate of benefits in the ABF Scheme and the EFRBS.
7.  Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
8.  Pension benefits include a 50% spouse's pension. Pensions are guaranteed to increase in line with RPI limited each year to 5% (2.5% 
for benefits accrued post 1 January 2008). Additional discretionary increases to pensions in payment have been granted in the past.
9.  As in previous years the directors' contributions during the period (D) recognises the amount of salary sacrifice made by the 
directors in lieu of paying contributions. Both directors  contribute' 15% of the scheme-specific salary cap so the amount is the 
same for both ( 21k).

Executive directors serving as non-executive directors
During the year, George Weston served as a non-executive director of Wittington Investments Limited, for which he received no 
compensation. 
John Bason is a non-executive director and chairman of the Audit committee of Compass Group PLC, for which he received a total 
fee of  103,000 in the 2012/13 financial year. He also served as a trustee of Voluntary Service Overseas and as deputy chairman of 
the charity FareShare, but received no compensation in respect of either of these roles.
Compliance statement
The Remuneration committee has made major changes to the structure and content of the 2013 Remuneration report in recognition 
of the government's new reporting requirements set out in the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2013. The requirements under these Regulations will be implemented in full in the 2014 report, with the  
Policy section first subject to a binding vote at the 2014 annual general meeting of the Company. 
The current report sets out the policy and disclosures on directors' remuneration as required by the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 issued under the Companies Act 2006 ( the Act'). In accordance 
with the Act, a resolution to approve the 2013 report will be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting of the Company. 
The vote will have advisory status in respect of the remuneration policy and overall remuneration packages and will not be specific  
to individual levels of remuneration. 
KPMG Audit Plc has audited the report to the extent required by the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) Regulations 2008, being the sections in the Remuneration report for 2012/13 above entitled  Total directors' interests 
in shares',  Long-term incentives',  Pensions' and  Summary of directors' remuneration'.
