 66 Associated British Ports Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2002
Remuneration report
Introduction
The directors confirm that this report has been
drawn up in accordance with Schedule B of the
Combined Code and Statutory Instrument - SI
2002/1986,  The directors' remuneration report
regulations 2002' issued by the Department of
Trade and Industry in August 2002. 
The Remuneration Committee comprises all non-
executive directors and is currently chaired by
George Duncan. The committee takes into
account the views of the Group Chief Executive in
determining the remuneration for other executive
directors of the company and the directors of the
subsidiary board of ABP . The Group Chief
Executive does not attend any meetings of the
committee at which his own remuneration is
discussed. The functions of the Remuneration
Committee are described in the corporate
governance statement on page 64.
Remuneration policy
The group's remuneration policy is designed to
attract, retain and motivate key senior executives
with the relevant skills to achieve its business
objectives and to align their interests with those 
of shareholders by recognising and rewarding
performance. The committee aims to ensure that
the remuneration packages for executive directors
are competitive with other companies of similar
size, activities and complexity. It reviews the total
remuneration package and the balance of its
various elements regularly. During the course of
the year, the committee undertook a review which
resulted in a proposal to shareholders to
supplement the Executive Share Option Scheme
with a new Long-Term Incentive Plan. In
determining the appropriate levels of remuneration
for executive directors, the committee takes
independent advice from New Bridge Street
Consultants. The use of external consultants and
the choice of consultant is a matter reserved for
the committee. The consultants appointed to
provide advice on executive remuneration do not
provide any other services to the group. 
The remuneration package for executive directors
incorporates a competitive basic salary , a performance
-related annual cash bonus, share-related incentive
schemes, pension and other benefits. In determining
executive remuneration, the Remuneration
Committee takes into account pay and employment
conditions across the group. It aims to link a
percentage of the overall package for the senior
executives and executive directors to the group's
short-and long-term business performance.
The board determines the remuneration for non-
executive directors. The company maintains contact
as necessary with its principal shareholders on
remuneration matters.
Basic salary
The committee's objective is to ensure that the
basic salary for each director is appropriate and
competitive for the responsibilities involved. Base
salaries are reviewed annually and any increase 
in the basic salary of directors is awarded only
after taking into account individual performance,
changes in responsibilities and external advice as
to appropriate salary levels for each position.
Performance-related bonus
A performance-related annual cash bonus scheme
is open to senior management and is non-
pensionable. The payment to executive directors
for achievement of target is 30 per cent of basic
salary, with up to a further 30 per cent of basic
salary payable for exceptional outperformance 
of target. Under the scheme, senior management
receive payment in the range of 10 to 20 per cent
of basic salary for on-target performance and a
further 10 to 20 per cent of basic salary for
exceptional outperformance of target. Bonuses 
in the range of 5 per cent to 36 per cent are payable
in respect of 2002.
Share-related incentives
Executive Share Option Scheme
The group operates a performance-related
Executive Share Option Scheme to reward executive
directors and senior management. The overall aim
of this scheme is to align the interests of key
executives with the group's objective of creating
shareholder value in the longer term.
Options are issued annually at the share price
prevailing at the date of issue. As payment is made
at the date of exercise, no consideration is payable
at the time of grant of these options.
Options may not be exercised unless and until the
earnings per share target has been achieved. This
target requires the percentage growth in the group's
earnings per share to exceed the rate of inflation
by at least three per cent per annum for a minimum
period of three years. If the earnings per share
target is not achieved at the end of the minimum
period, it will be extended for a further year and
again at the end of the fourth year. If the earnings
per share target is not achieved by the end of the
fifth year, the options will lapse. Options granted
to the executive directors in 1999 vested during
the year, as the actual growth of 31.3 per cent in
the group's earnings per share over the three-year
period from 1 January 1999, exceeded the
15.2 per cent growth required. In line with current
market practice, the group continues to use earnings
per share as the target for the remaining options
held by executive directors and other senior
managers on the basis that it is an indicator closely
aligned to shareholder value.

shareholder return (TSR) compared with the FTSE

Long-Term Incentive Plan
As part of a wider review of executive directors'
remuneration, the company reviewed its long-
term incentive arrangements during 2002. One
recommendation from this review was the
introduction of a new Long-Term Incentive Plan
for executive directors to strengthen the link
between the most senior executives' remuneration
and the long-term performance of the group. 
A resolution seeking shareholder approval for the
introduction of this plan is being proposed at the
Annual General Meeting on 15 April 2003.
Under the plan, executive directors may receive
annual share awards of up to a maximum
individual limit of 100 per cent of base salary 
per annum. In line with current best practice, the
vesting of the shares will be based on the company' s
performance in terms of TSR, compared to a
group comprising the FTSE companies ranked
from 51 to 150 by market capitalisation, excluding
companies in the financial, IT and
telecommunications sectors. The exact list of
companies will be based on the average market
capitalisation of companies over three months
prior to the beginning of the performance period.
Each performance period will last three years and
will start at the beginning of the financial year in
which the award is made. TSR will be averaged
over the six months prior to the start and end of
the performance period. Thirty per cent of the
shares will vest for attaining a median ranking;
100 per cent of the shares will vest if the
company is ranked in the upper decile. There 
will be pro-rata vesting for performance between
median and upper decile. No shares will vest for
below-median ranking or unless real growth in
earnings per share has been achieved over the
performance period.
Executive directors will be required to retain shares
worth 50 per cent of the post-tax gain made
through the exercise of options until they hold
shares with a value equivalent to their base salary.
The remuneration committee has chosen TSR as the
performance criterion for future vestings of awards
made under the Long-Term Incentive Plan because
it believes it desirable to link part of the long-term
remuneration to out-performing companies of a
similar size.
Other share schemes
Subject to a minimum period of service, all UK
employees, including executive directors, are
eligible to participate in the ABP Share Incentive
Plan (SIP) and the group's Savings-Related Share
Option Scheme (SRSOS). Under the SIP , employees
can elect to purchase shares out of their pre-tax
and National Insurance salaries, up to a maximum
of  125 per month. Shares purchased by
employees are allotted to a trustee on a monthly
basis. The allotted shares are held in trust for a
period of five years prior to vesting.
Under the SIP , employees can also elect to be
awarded free shares worth  250 annually. In
addition, participants can receive further shares of
up to a maximum value of  375 depending on the
achievement by the group of agreed targets with
regard to its annual pre-tax profits. Shares awarded
under this part of the scheme are also held in trust
for a period of five years prior to vesting.
Under the SRSOS, options are granted to employees
at a price which is 20 per cent less than the market
price at the date of grant. Employees can elect to
save up to a maximum of  250 per month for a
period of three or five years. At the end of the
elected savings period, the employee can use the
proceeds to acquire shares in the company at the
option price. The company operates plans similar
to the SRSOS for its employees in the USA.
Pension 
The company pays executive directors a supplement
calculated at 25 per cent of basic salary in lieu of
pension arrangements.
Other benefits
Other benefits are provided in line with market
practice. These include medical cover and a
company car or cash alternative.
Service contracts
The notice period contained within the employment
contracts of existing executive directors is one
year. The board may, if necessary, consider initial
contract periods in excess of one year in the
recruitment of new executive directors. Any such
contracts would revert to a one-year notice period
on expiry of the initial notice period.
In the event of the company facing a claim for
compensation for loss of office by a director, the
level of compensation would be subject to
mitigation if considered appropriate and legally
sustainable. There are no provisions for pre-
determined compensation in the service contracts
of existing directors.
