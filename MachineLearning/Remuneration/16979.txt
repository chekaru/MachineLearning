 Introduction
This report sets out the group' s policy and
disclosure in relation to directors' remuneration. It
has been prepared in accordance with the
Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations
2002 and explains how the group has applied the
principles of the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance in relation to remuneration of
directors. 
The company will seek the approval of this report
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting on 
21 April 2004. Directors of the company do not vote
on any matters relating to their own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee
The board of directors is responsible for executive
remuneration. It has established a Remuneration
Committee to make recommendations on policy ,
framework and the cost base of executive
remuneration within a formal terms of reference.
The terms of reference for the Committee are
available from the company' s website.
In addition to Ross Sayers, the company' s non-
executive Chairman, the Remuneration
Committee comprises the following independent
non-executive directors:
Aubrey Adams
Tim Bowdler
Stuart Chambers
Derek Sach (Committee Chairman)
Andrew Simon
Derek Sach was appointed Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee following the
retirement of George Duncan on 15 April 2003.
The Committee:
  Sets the company's broad policy on executive
remuneration
  Oversees any major changes in employee-
benefit structures throughout the group
  Determines targets for any performance-
related pay schemes the company operates 
  Agrees the terms and conditions of individual
executive directors, including their annual
remuneration. 
The Committee is authorised to appoint any advisers
it requires to fulfil its responsibilities, the choice and
use of which are Committee matters. Currently , it
has appointed New Bridge Street Consultants to
provide independent advice on determining
appropriate levels of remuneration. New Bridge
Street Consultants also manage the measurement
of performance against vesting targets for the
company' s Long T erm Incentive Plan (L TIP). 
The Committee also has access to Hywel Rees,
Company Secretary & Head of Group Personnel.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee takes
into account the views of the Group Chief Executive
in determining remuneration for Richard Adam,
Group Finance Director , and the directors of
Associated British Ports, the group' s main operating
entity . The Group Chief Executive does not attend
any Committee meetings at which his own
remuneration is discussed. 
Remuneration policy
The group' s remuneration policy is designed to attract,
retain and motivate key senior executives with the
relevant skills to achieve its business objectives, and
to align their interests with those of shareholders by
recognising and rewarding performance. T o achieve
this, remuneration packages for executive directors
are reviewed annually and designed to provide market
competitive rates of total remuneration based on
personal performance with the incentive of additional
remuneration on achievement of challenging targets.
Market rates are determined by reference to other
companies of similar size, activities and complexity .
The policy also aims to ensure that rewards for
executive directors are linked to the group' s 
short- and long-term performance. The Committee
keeps both the fixed and variable elements of each
director' s overall package under review . The variable
element represents a significant percentage of the
overall package for executive directors following
the introduction of performance-related annual
bonuses in 2000 and implementation of the L TIP
in 2003. T o further strengthen the link between
the interests of shareholders and management,
the company requires executive directors to retain
a proportion of the shares they may receive through
the L TIP until they are worth the same as their annual
base salary .

The percentage figures for base salary , annual

represent amounts expected to be paid in respect
of 2004 for on-target performance; L TIP and share
option percentages represent estimated values for
2004 grants using a Black Scholes model; the
share option percentages assume that all vesting
conditions are met in full; and the L TIP
percentages have been discounted to reflect
vesting conditions under a Black Scholes model.
The company maintains contact with its principal
shareholders on remuneration matters as necessary
and does not intend to make any changes to its
remuneration policy for the coming year .
Executive directors
The remuneration package for executive directors
comprises a competitive basic salary , a
performance-related annual cash bonus, share-
related incentive schemes, pensions supplement
and other benefits. In determining executive
remuneration, the Committee takes into account
pay and employment conditions across the group. 
Basic salary
The Committee's objective is to ensure that the
basic salary for each director is appropriate and
competitive for the responsibilities involved. Base
salaries are reviewed annually with input from the
company' s independent remuneration consultants
as appropriate; any increases are awarded only
after taking into account individual performance,
changes in responsibilities and external advice as
to appropriate salary levels for each position. 
Following a review of executive directors'
remuneration undertaken in October 2002, Bo
Lerenius, Group Chief Executive, and Richard
Adam, Group Finance Director , received base
salary increases of 9.8 per cent and 22.4 per cent,
respectively , for the year commencing 1 January
2003. These increases were designed to realign
the base salaries of the executive directors with
the market rates of salaries offered by the
company' s peer group as determined by the
independent remuneration consultants, and
granted after taking into account their input. 
Following the most recent annual review of
remuneration, base salaries for executive
directors are to increase by 3.3 per cent for the
year commencing 1 January 2004.
Performance-related bonus
In order to reward performance against short-
term targets, the Committee has established a
non-pensionable annual performance-related
bonus scheme for executive directors and other
senior management. 
For executive directors, the maximum bonus is
capped at 60 per cent of base salary , up to 30 per
cent of base salary is payable for on-target
performance; a further 30 per cent of base salary
is payable for exceptional outperformance
against targets. Other senior managers are
eligible for payment of up to 20 per cent of base
salary for on-target performance, and a further 
20 per cent of base salary for exceptional
outperformance of target.
The group' s performance targets relate to some
or all of the following:
  Growth in the group' s underlying ports and
transport operating profit
  Growth in the group' s underlying earnings per
share
  Attainment of return on capital employed
targets
  Attainment of group health and safety targets.
The group will pay bonuses in the range of 2 
per cent to 43 per cent for 2003, as it achieved its
targets either partly or wholly in relation to the
growth in its underlying ports and transport
operating profit, underlying earnings per share
and return on capital employed. Actual amounts
payable based on the above criteria were
reduced by 5 per cent as the group failed to meet
its target of reducing reportable injuries per
thousand employees to 12 or below.
Share-related incentives
Executive directors and other senior managers
are entitled to participate in the following share-
related incentive schemes which are designed to
link their long-term interests with those of the
company: the Executive Share Option Scheme
(ESOS), the Savings-Related Share Option
Scheme (SRSOS), the Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
and the Long T erm Incentive Plan (L TIP).
Participation in the L TIP is currently limited to the
executive directors of the company .
Executive Share Option Scheme
Options granted under the ESOS may only be
exercised once the underlying earnings per share
target has been achieved. They are issued annually
at the share price prevailing on the date of grant. 
The value of options granted annually to each
executive director and senior manager is currently
limited to one times their annual base salary .
Details of grants made to the executive directors
during the year are set out on page 83. 
The target set in relation to the vesting of all
outstanding ESOS options requires the growth 
of the group's underlying earnings per share to
exceed the rate of inflation by at least 3 per cent
per annum for a minimum period of three years. 
If this target is not achieved after three years, the
minimum period will be extended by one year at
the end of the third year and by a further year at
the end of the fourth year . If the target has not
been met by the end of the fifth year , the options
will lapse.  80
Remuneration report
Options granted to the executive directors in 2000
vested in full during 2003. The group' s underlying
earnings per share grew by 31.6 per cent in the
three-year period from 1 January 2000 (from 23.1
pence to 30.4 pence), exceeding the movement in
the retail price index (which increased by 6.7 per cent
to 178.5) by more than the required 3 per cent per
annum, taking the performance period as a whole.
The group uses growth in underlying earnings per
share as the target for the remaining options held
by executive directors and other senior managers
as this is an externally audited indicator which can
be verified independently and is closely aligned to
shareholder value. The Committee reviews the
appropriateness of its measure and target
adopted at the time of each grant. Further details
on the options held by each executive director
under the ESOS are provided on page 83.
The company monitors and, when appropriate,
manages the dilution impact arising from the
exercise of share options granted to employees.
The targets set and actual performance of the group
in relation to unvested option grants are detailed
in the table below:
2003 target

2002 28.1 31.4 31.0
2003 30.4 32.2 31.0
Savings-Related Share Option Scheme
Under the SRSOS, the company grants options to
eligible employees, including executive directors,
at an option price that is 20 per cent lower than the
market price at the date of grant. Employees can
elect to save up to  250 per month for a period of
three or five years. At the end of the elected
savings period, they can use the proceeds to
acquire shares in the company at the option price.
The company operates similar plans for its
employees in the USA. There are no performance
conditions attached to the vesting of options
granted under the SRSOS. Further details on the
options held by each executive director under the
SRSOS are provided on page 83.
Share Incentive Plan
Subject to a minimum period of service, all UK
employees, including executive directors, are
eligible to participate in the SIP . Participating
employees can elect to purchase up to  125 of
shares out of their pre-tax and National Insurance
salaries per month. The shares are allotted to a
trustee on a monthly basis and held in trust for a
period of five years prior to vesting.
Employees can also elect to be awarded free
shares worth  250 each year; participating
employees can receive further shares up to a
maximum annual value of  375 if the group
achieves its annual underlying pre-tax profit
target. Shares awarded under this part of the
scheme are again held in trust for a period of five
years prior to vesting.
Awards under the SIP for 2003 were limited to
 250 for each participating employee as the
group failed to achieve its underlying pre-tax profit
target for the year . The SIP will be open to eligible
employees once again in 2004.
Long-T erm Incentive Plan
The company introduced an L TIP during 2003 to
further strengthen the link between the most
senior executives' remuneration and the long-
term performance of the group. It enables executive
directors to receive annual share awards of up to
100 per cent of their base salary . The vesting of the
shares is based on the company' s performance in
terms of total shareholder return (TSR) compared
to the group of FTSE companies ranked between 50
and 150 by market capitalisation, excluding companies
in the financial, IT and telecommunications
sectors. The exact list of companies is based on
the average market capitalisation of companies
over the three months prior to the beginning of the
performance period. Each performance period
lasts three years and commences at the beginning
of the financial year in which the award is made. 
TSR is averaged over the six months prior to the
start and end of the performance period. Thirty
per cent of the shares vest for attaining a median
ranking; 100 per cent of the shares vest if the
company is ranked in the upper deciles; there is
pro-rata vesting for performance between median
and upper decile. No shares vest for below-median
ranking. The company' s independent remuneration
consultants manage the measur ement of performance
against vesting targets in line with the plan rules
circulated to shareholders prior to the approval of
the L TIP in 2003.
During the year , Bo Lerenius, Group Chief Executive,
and Richard Adam, Group Finance Director , received
conditional awards of shares equivalent to their
annual base salaries as at 1 January 2003. Further
details on the number of shares issued to each
director under the L TIP are provided on page 83.

As required by the Directors' Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002, the graph below sets
out the group' s TSR compared with the FTSE
top-250 comparator group of companies over
the five-year period to 31 December 2003.
The company has selected the FTSE top-250
comparator group as its FTSE ranking has
ranged from 97 to 124 during 2003. In line with
market practice, the calculation for TSR assumes
reinvestment of dividends and is based on data
provided by Datastream. 
Pension 
The company pays executive directors a
supplement of 25 per cent of basic salary in lieu of
pension arrangements.
Other benefits
The company provides other benefits in line with
market practice. These include medical cover
and a company car or cash alternative.
Service contracts
The employment contracts of existing executive
directors contain a notice period of one year . The
board may , if necessary , consider initial contract
periods in excess of one year in the recruitment of
new executive directors. Any such contracts
would revert to a one-year notice period on expiry
of the initial notice period.
In the event of the company facing a claim for
compensation by an executive director for loss of
office, the level of compensation would be subject
to mitigation if considered appropriate and legally
sustainable. The service contracts of existing
directors do not contain any provisions for pre-
determined compensation. The table below sets
out details of directors' contracts.
Expected
Executive Date of Noticeretirement
director appointment period age
Richard Adam 15.11.1999 One year 65
Bo Lerenius 17.05.1999 One year 65
External appointments
The company believes that the experience gained by
executive directors through their involvement with
other companies has the potential to be beneficial
to both the individual and the company . The
company' s current policy on external appointments
is to allow executive directors to accept one external
non-executive appointment providing that the
time commitments involved do not undermine the
performance of their company duties. Directors
are permitted to retain any fees earned through
such appointments. Fees earned by Bo Lerenius
and Richard Adam from external appointments
for the year ending 31 December 2003 amounted
to  38,524 and  4,000, respectively . Further details
of current appointments held by executive directors
are set out in their biographies on pages 68 to 69.
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors are appointed to the
board for an initial term of three years and are
permitted to offer themselves for re-election for
subsequent terms of three years. They do not
hold service contracts with the company . 
T o determine the fees it pays to non-executive
directors, the board takes into account the need
to attract individuals of appropriate calibre and
expertise, the fees paid to non-executive
directors by other companies of a similar size, and
the time commitment attached to each appointment.
The board keeps fees under review. Non-executive
directors do not participate in the performance-
related annual bonus, any of the group' s equity-
linked remuneration plans or the pension scheme.
All non-executive directors sit on the company' s
Remuneration and Nomination Committees and,
except for Ross Sayers and Stuart Chambers, the
Audit Committee also. Following the publication
of the updated Combined Code on Corporate
Governance, the board considered whether it
would be appropriate to make additional payments
to non-executive directors for their membership
of these committees. It concluded that it was
appropriate to pay the respective chairmen of the
Audit and Remuneration Committees and the
Senior Independent Director an additional  7,500
a year , but that it was not appropriate to make
additional payments to other committee members.
