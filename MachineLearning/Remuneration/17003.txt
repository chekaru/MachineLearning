 INTRODUCTION
This report sets out the group's policy and
disclosure in relation to directors'
remuneration. It has been prepared in
accordance with the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002
and explains how the group has applied
the principles of the Combined Code on
Corporate Governance in relation to the
remuneration of directors. 
The 2003 report on remuneration was
approved by the shareholders at the
Annual General Meeting in April 2004.
The company will seek the approval of
this report at the forthcoming Annual
General Meeting on 26 April 2005.
Directors do not vote on any matters
relating to their own remuneration.
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The board of directors is responsible for
executive remuneration. It has
established a Remuneration Committee
to make recommendations on policy,
framework and the cost base of executive
remuneration within formal terms of
reference. The terms of reference for the
Committee are available at
www.abports.co.uk. 
The Committee comprises all of the
independent non-executive directors. 
For full details of its current membership
and the attendees at the meetings of 
the Committee held during 2004, see
page 81.
Derek Sach, who possesses relevant
previous experience, is the chairman of
the Committee. The Committee:
  Sets the group's broad policy on
executive remuneration
  Oversees any major changes in
employee-benefit structures
throughout the group
  Determines targets for any
performance-related pay schemes the
group operates 
  Approves grants of share options 
to directors
  Agrees the terms and conditions of
executive directors, including their
annual remuneration. 
The Committee is authorised to appoint
any advisers it requires to fulfil its
responsibilities, the choice and use of
which are Committee matters. Currently, it
uses New Bridge Street Consultants to
provide independent advice on determining
appropriate levels of remuneration. New
Bridge Street Consultants also manages
the measurement of performance against
vesting targets for the Long-T erm
Incentive Plan (L TIP). The Committee also
has access to Hywel Rees, Company
Secretary & Head of Group Personnel.
In addition, the Committee takes into
account the views of the Group Chief
Executive in determining remuneration
for Richard Adam, Group Finance
Director . The Group Chief Executive does
not attend any Committee meetings at
which his own remuneration is discussed. 
REMUNERATION POLICY
The group's remuneration policy is
designed to attract, retain and motivate
key senior executives with the relevant
skills to achieve its business objectives
and to align their interests with those of
shareholders by recognising and
rewarding performance. This policy was
followed during 2004 and will remain in
place in the future. To achieve its aims,
remuneration packages for executive
directors are reviewed annually and are
designed to provide market-competitive
rates of total remuneration based on
personal performance, with the incentive
of additional remuneration on
achievement of challenging targets.
Market rates are determined by reference
to other companies of similar size,
activities and complexity. 
The group's policy is based on the premise
that rewards for executive directors should
be linked to the attainment of its objectives.
The Committee keeps both the fixed and
variable elements of each director's overall
package under review. In line with market
practice, the variable element now
represents a significant percentage of the
overall package for executive directors,
following the introduction of performance-
related annual bonuses in 2000 and the
implementation of the L TIP in 2003. The
Committee considers that the targets set
for the variable element of remuneration
are appropriate and demanding in the
context of the group's trading environment
and the business challenges it faces.

The percentage figures for base salary,
annual bonus, pension contributions and
benefits represent amounts expected to
be paid in respect of 2005; LTIP and share
option percentages represent estimated
values for 2004 grants using a Black-
Scholes model.
The company maintains contact with its
principal shareholders on remuneration
matters as necessary.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration package for executive
directors comprises a competitive basic
salary, a performance-related annual
cash bonus, share-related incentive
schemes, pension supplement and other
benefits. In determining executive
remuneration, the Committee takes into
account pay and employment conditions
across the group. 
BASIC SALARY
The Committee's objective is to ensure
that the basic salary for each director is
appropriate and competitive for the
responsibilities involved. Base salaries
are reviewed annually with input from the
independent remuneration consultants as
appropriate; any increases are awarded
only after taking into account individual
performance, changes in responsibilities,
the group's prospects, the wider
economic and employment backdrop and
external advice as to appropriate salary
levels for each position. During the year
ended 31 December 2004, the base
salaries for Bo Lerenius, Group Chief
Executive, and Richard Adam, Group
Finance Director, increased by 3.3 per
cent. Following the most recent annual
review of remuneration by the
Committee, base salaries for executive
directors are to increase by 7.5 per cent
for Bo Lerenius and 4.8 per cent for
Richard Adam for the year commencing 
1 January 2005. These changes were
designed to ensure the base salaries of
the executive directors remain
competitive with the market rates of
salaries offered by the company's peers,
as determined by the independent
remuneration consultants.
PERFORMANCE-RELATED BONUS
In order to reward performance against
short-term targets, the Committee has
established a non-pensionable annual
performance-related bonus scheme for
executive directors and other senior
management. The bonus scheme is
designed to motivate the executive
directors and senior managers to not only
attain but exceed key targets set out in
the group's annual budget.
For executive directors, up to 30 per cent
of base salary is payable for on-target
performance; a further 30 per cent of
base salary is payable for exceptional
outperformance against targets. Other
senior managers are eligible for payment
of up to 20 per cent of base salary for on-
target performance and a further 
20 per cent of base salary for exceptional
outperformance of target.
The group's performance targets for
executive directors, which are agreed by
the Remuneration Committee, relate to
the following:
  Growth in the group's underlying
earnings per share
  Growth in the group's underlying ports
and transport operating profits
  Attainment of group health and safety
targets.
In addition, senior managers with
responsibilities linked to individual
operations are assessed on the attainment
of return on capital employed targets.
Figure 6 provides a summary of the
targets used to assess the attainment of
bonuses by executive directors under the
2004 scheme.
The group will pay bonuses in the range
of nil to 31 per cent of base salary for
2004, as it partially achieved its targets in
relation to growth in underlying earnings
per share and underlying ports and
transport operating profits and achieved
its target for reducing reportable injuries
per thousand employees.
SHARE-RELATED INCENTIVES
Executive directors and other senior
managers are entitled to participate in the
following share-related incentive schemes,
which are designed to link their long-term
interests with those of the group: the
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS);
the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme
(SRSOS); the Share Incentive Plan (SIP);
the Long-T erm Incentive Plan (L TIP).
Participation in the L TIP is currently
limited to the executive directors. 
The company is aware of the limits included
in the guidelines issued by the Association
of British Insurers (ABI) in relation to the
percentage of issued share capital that can
be subject to options to subscribe. These
guidelines recommend that no more than
five per cent of the issued share capital
should be committed to options under
discretionary schemes over a 10-year
period and no more than 10 per cent of the
issued capital should be committed to
options under all schemes over a 10-year
period. The company' s current position in
respect of these limits is set out in figure 7.

*Subject to the overall amount of bonus received by any bonus scheme participant being capped at the
maximum percentage noted above, amounts paid to all employees are adjusted to reflect the group's
performance in relation to the number of reportable injuries per thousand employees suffered by its 
UK ports and transport operations. Bonus amounts otherwise payable are reduced by 5 per cent for an
incidence rate of more than 15 and increased by 10 per cent for an incidence rate of less than 12. 
No adjustments are made for an incidence rate of between 12 and 15.
FIGURE 6 REMUNERATION 
REPORT
EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME
Except in a very limited number of
circumstances, options granted under the
ESOS may only be exercised once the
underlying earnings per share (EPS) target
has been achieved. Options may also
become exercisable following a change in
control of the company . However, the EPS
target does not apply on change of control
if exercise takes place before the start of
the normal exercise period; under these
circumstances, only a proportion of the
options, calculated on a time-elapsed
basis, may be exercised. Options are issued
annually, at a price equal to the average of
the share prices on the five days
immediately preceding the date of grant. 
Currently, the value of options granted
annually to each executive director and
senior manager is limited to one times
their annual base salary. Details of grants
made to the executive directors during
the year are set out on page 91. 
The target set in relation to the vesting of
all outstanding ESOS options requires the
growth of the group's underlying EPS to
exceed the rate of inflation by at least
three per cent per annum for a minimum
period of three years. For options issued
under the ESOS prior to 2004, the
minimum period will be extended by one
year at the end of the third year and by a
further year at the end of the fourth year if
this target is not achieved after three
years. If the target has not been met by
the end of the fifth year, the options will
lapse. For options issued under the ESOS
during 2004 and in the future, the options
will lapse if the target is not achieved after
three years. The company introduced this
change during the year in order to align its
practices with current best practice.
Options granted to the executive directors
in 2001 vested in full during 2004. The
group's underlying EPS grew by 17.9 per
cent in the three-year period from 
1 January 2001 (from 26.3 pence to 
31.0 pence), exceeding the movement in
the retail prices index (which increased by
6.6 per cent) by more than the required
three per cent per annum, taking the
performance period as a whole. 
The group uses growth in underlying EPS
as the target for the remaining options
held by executive directors and other
senior managers, as this is an externally
audited indicator which can be verified
independently and is closely aligned to
shareholder value. The Committee
reviews the appropriateness of its
measure and target adopted at the time
of each grant. Further details on the
options held by each executive director
under the ESOS are provided on page 91.
The targets set and actual performance
of the group in relation to unvested option
grants are detailed in figure 8.
FIGURE 8
The Committee is aware that the adoption
of International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) from 1 January 2005,
which is discussed on pages 35 to 36, will
lead to changes in its reported EPS. To
ensure consistent measurement as to the
attainment of the EPS target, the
Committee intends to apply IFRS for all
grants made after 1 January 2002.
SAVINGS-RELATED 
SHARE OPTION SCHEME
Under the SRSOS, the company grants
options to eligible employees, including
executive directors, at an option price that
is 20 per cent lower than the market price
at the date of grant. Employees can elect
to save up to  250 per month for a period
of three or five years. At the end of the
elected savings period, they can use the
proceeds to acquire shares at the option
price. The group operates similar plans
for its employees in the USA. There are
no performance conditions attached to
the vesting of options granted under the
SRSOS. Further details on the options
held by each executive director under the
SRSOS are provided on page 92.
SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN
Subject to a minimum period of service, all
UK employees, including executive
directors, are eligible to participate in the
SIP . Participating employees can elect to
purchase up to  125 of shares out of their
pre-tax and National Insurance salaries
per month. The shares are allotted to a
trustee on a monthly basis and held in trust
for a period of five years prior to vesting.
During 2004, employees had the
opportunity to elect to be awarded free
shares worth  250 for the year; the
scheme also allowed participating
employees to receive further shares up to
a maximum annual value of  375 if the
group achieved its annual underlying pre-
tax profit target. To further strengthen the
link between employee rewards and the
group's performance, the base award for
2005 was reduced to  125 while the
performance element was increased to
 500. Shares awarded under this part of
the scheme are again held in trust for a
period of five years prior to vesting.
As the group failed to achieve its
underlying pre-tax profit target for the
year, awards under the SIP for 2004 were
limited to  250 for each participating
employee. The SIP will be open to eligible
employees once again in 2005.

PERFORMANCE RESULTS GOVERNANCE 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
The company introduced the LTIP during
2003 to further strengthen the link
between the most senior executives'
remuneration and the long-term
performance of the group. It enables
executive directors to receive annual
share awards of up to 100 per cent of
their base salary. The vesting of the
shares is based on the company's
performance in terms of total
shareholder return (TSR) compared to the
group of FTSE companies ranked from 
51 to 150 by market capitalisation,
excluding companies in the financial, 
IT and telecommunications sectors. The
exact list of companies is based on the
average market capitalisation of
companies over the three months prior to
the beginning of each performance
period. Each performance period lasts
three years and commences at the
beginning of the financial year in which
the award is made. 
TSR is averaged over the six months prior
to the start and end of each performance
period. Thirty per cent of the shares vest
for attaining a median ranking; 100 per
cent of the shares vest if the company is
ranked in the upper decile; there is pro-
rata vesting for performance between
median and upper decile. No shares vest
for below-median ranking. The
independent remuneration consultants
manage the measurement of
performance against vesting targets, in
line with the plan rules circulated to
shareholders prior to the approval of the
LTIP in 2003. In the event of a change of
control, the performance period ends on
the relevant date and the vesting of the
relevant awards, based on the normal
criteria, is restricted by reference to
reduction in the performance period. 
During the year, Bo Lerenius, Group Chief
Executive, and Richard Adam, Group
Finance Director, received conditional
awards of shares equivalent to their
annual base salaries as at 1 January
2004. Further details on the number of
shares issued to each director under the
LTIP are provided on page 92. Figure 9
sets out the vesting status as at 
31 December 2004 of LTIP grants.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN
As required by the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002,
figure 10 sets out the group's TSR
compared with the FTSE top-250
comparator group of companies over the
five-year period to 31 December 2004. 
FIGURE 10
The company has selected the FTSE 
top-250 comparator group because its
FTSE ranking as at 31 December 2004
was 136 (2003:125). In line with market
practice, the calculation for TSR assumes
reinvestment of dividends and is based on
data provided by Datastream. 
PENSION 
The company pays executive directors a
supplement of 25 per cent of basic salary
in lieu of pension arrangements.
OTHER BENEFITS
The company provides other benefits 
in line with market practice. These
include medical cover and a company car
or cash alternative.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
The employment contracts of the current
executive directors contain a notice period
of one year . The board may, if necessary,
consider initial contract periods in excess
of one year in the recruitment of new
executive directors. Any such contracts
would revert to a one-year notice period
on expiry of the initial notice period.
In the event of the company facing a
claim for compensation by an executive
director for loss of office, the level of
compensation would be subject to
mitigation if considered appropriate and
legally sustainable. The service contracts
of existing directors do not contain any
provisions for pre-determined
compensation. Figure 11 sets out details
of directors' contracts.
FIGURE 11
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
The group believes that the experience
gained by executive directors through
their involvement with other companies
has the potential to be beneficial to both
the individual and the group. The current
policy on external appointments is to
allow executive directors to accept one
external non-executive appointment as
long as the time commitments involved
do not undermine the performance of
their duties. During 2004, Bo Lerenius,
who was appointed as non-executive
director with Group 4 Securicor plc in
2003, was permitted to accept a second
non-executive appointment with Land
Securities plc. The approval for this
second appointment was considered and
granted by the Chairman in conjunction
with the independent non-executive
directors. It is anticipated that, except for

directors will not be permitted to take on
any further external appointments.
Directors are permitted to retain any fees
earned through such appointments. Fees
earned by Bo Lerenius and Richard Adam
from external appointments for the year
ending 31 December 2004 amounted to
 53,417 and  33,750, respectively. Further
details of current appointments held by
executive directors are set out in their
biographies on pages 74 to 75.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Non-executive directors are appointed to
the board for an initial term of three years
and are permitted to offer themselves for
re-election for subsequent terms of three
years. Non-executive directors who have
served on the board for a period in excess
of nine years are required to offer
themselves for re-election on an annual
basis. They do not have service contracts.
To determine the fees it pays to non-
executive directors, the board takes 
into account the need to attract
individuals of appropriate calibre and
expertise, the fees paid to non-executive
directors by other companies of a similar
size and the time commitment attached
to each appointment. The board keeps
fees under review. Non-executive
directors do not participate in the
performance-related annual bonus, any
of the group's equity-linked remuneration
plans or the pension scheme.
Full details of the committee
memberships held by the non-executive
directors are set out on page 81. All non-
executive directors sit on the Audit,
Nomination and Remuneration
Committees with the exception of Chris
Clark, who does not sit on the Audit
Committee or the Remuneration
Committee as he is not considered to be 
independent under the updated
Combined Code on Corporate
Governance. Following the publication of
the updated Combined Code, the board
considered whether it would be
appropriate to make additional payments
to non-executive directors for their
membership of these committees. 
It concluded that it was appropriate to 
pay the respective chairmen of the Audit
and Remuneration Committees an
additional  7,500 a year, but that it was
not appropriate to make additional
payments to other committee members.
