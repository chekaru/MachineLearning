The committee is authorised to appoint any 
advisers it requires to fulfi l its responsibilities, 
the choice and use of which are committee 
matters. Currently, it uses New Bridge Street 
Consultants LLP to provide independent 
advice on determining appropriate levels of 
remuneration. New Bridge Street 
Consultants LLP also manages the 
measurement of performance against 
vesting targets for the Long-T erm Incentive 
Plan (L TIP). The committee also has access 
to Hywel Rees, Company Secretary and 
Head of Group Personnel.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee 
takes into account the views of the Group 
Chief Executive in determining remuneration 
for Richard Adam, Group Finance Director , 
and Doug Morrison, executive director . 
Neither the Group Chief Executive nor any 
of the other executive directors is present 
at committee meetings where their own 
remuneration is discussed. 
A summary of matters considered and 
actions taken at each committee meeting 
held in 2005 is shown in table 4 on 
page 119.
Remuneration policy
The group's remuneration policy is designed 
to attract, retain and motivate key senior 
executives with the relevant skills to achieve 
its business objectives and to align their 
interests with those of shareholders by 
recognising and rewarding performance. T o 
achieve its aims, remuneration packages for 
executive directors are reviewed annually 
and are designed to provide market-
competitive rates of total remuneration 
based on personal performance with the 
incentive of additional remuneration on 
achievement of challenging targets. Market 
rates are determined by reference to other 
companies of similar size, activities 
and complexity. 
The committee's full terms of reference are 
available on the group's website, www.
abports.co.uk. Alternatively, the company 
can provide them upon request. 
The committee comprises all of the 
independent non-executive directors. For 
full details of its membership, together with 
attendance records for 2005, see table 1, 
page 108. Stuart Chambers is Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee, having 
succeeded Derek Sach on 26 April 2005. 
As the Chief Executive of Pilkington plc, 
Stuart has wide business and board 
experience and is considered to have the 
necessary experience for the role. 
The committee:
 Determines and keeps under review the 
group's broad policy for the remuneration 
of the Chairman, executive directors and 
other senior managers
 Oversees major changes in employee-
benefi t structures throughout the group
 Approves the design of and determines 
targets for any performance-related pay 
schemes the group operates 
 Reviews the design of all share incentive 
plans for approval by the board and 
shareholders and approves grants 
of share options to directors and 
senior managers
 Within the terms of the agreed policy, 
determines the terms and conditions of 
executive directors, including their total 
remuneration packages
 Reports to the board and external 
stakeholders on matters within its 
responsibilities and duties.
Levels of remuneration should be 
suffi cient to attract, retain and motivate 
directors of the quality required to run 
the company successfully, but a 
company should avoid paying more than 
is necessary for this purpose. A 
signifi cant proportion of executive 
directors' remuneration should be 
structured so as to link rewards to 
corporate and individual performance. 
Combined Code - Main Principle B.1 
There should be a formal and 
transparent procedure for developing 
policy on executive remuneration and 
for fi xing the remuneration packages 
of individual directors. No director 
should be involved in deciding his or her 
own remuneration.

Introduction
This report sets out the group's policy and 
disclosure in relation to directors' 
remuneration. It has been prepared in 
accordance with the Directors' 
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 
and explains how the group has applied 
the principles of the Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance in relation to the 
remuneration of directors. 
The 2004 directors' report on remuneration 
was approved by the shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM) in April 
2005. The company will seek approval of 
this report at the forthcoming AGM on 
26 April 2006. Directors do not vote on any 
matters relating to their own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee
The board of directors is responsible for 
executive remuneration. It has established a 
Remuneration Committee to make 
recommendations on policy, framework and 
the cost base of executive remuneration.

The group' s policy is based on the premise 
that rewards for executive directors should 
be linked to the attainment of its objectives. 
The committee keeps both the fi xed and 
variable elements of each director' s overall 
package under review. During 2005, the 
committee conducted a full review of the 
company' s executive incentive policy , with 
the assistance of New Bridge Street 
Consultants LLP , in the context of the 
company' s circumstances and objectives, 
investor guidelines and changes in 
accounting standards and practice. 
Proposals from this review are being 
submitted to shareholders for approval. In 
addition to bringing the company' s 
arrangements into line with market practice, 
these proposals will lead to an increased 
proportion of executive remuneration being 
linked to performance. In recent years, the

appropriate; any increases are awarded 
only after taking into account individual 
performance, changes in responsibilities, 
the group's prospects, the wider economic 
and employment backdrop and external 
advice as to appropriate salary levels for 
each position. Base salaries for executive 
directors, which are summarised in table 5, 
are reviewed annually at the beginning of 
each year.
Performance-related bonus
In order to reward performance against 
short-term targets, the committee has 
established a discretionary non-pensionable 
annual performance-related bonus scheme 
for executive directors and other senior 
management. The bonus scheme is 
designed to motivate the executive directors 
and senior managers to not only attain, but 
also to exceed, key targets set out in the 
group's annual budget.
For 2005, executive directors were able to 
earn bonus amounts of up to 30 per cent 
of base salary for on-target performance; 
up to a further 30 per cent of base salary 
was payable for exceptional 
outperformance against targets. Other 
senior managers were eligible for payment 
of up to 20 per cent of base salary for 
on-target performance and up to a further 
20 per cent of base salary for exceptional 
outperformance against target.
The percentage fi gures for base salary, 
annual bonus, pension contributions or 
pension benefi ts accrued and other 
benefi ts represent amounts estimated as 
being accrued for on-target performance in 
2006; performance shares percentages are 
based on estimated amounts vesting for 
on-target performance and share option 
percentages represent estimated values for 
2006 grants using a Black-Scholes model.
Subject to shareholder approval of the 
proposed new long-term incentive 
arrangements, components of executive 
remuneration, based on estimated target 
levels of pay, for 2007 and beyond are set 
out in fi gure 5.
The percentage fi gures for base salary, 
annual bonus, pension contributions or 
pension benefi ts accrued and other 
benefi ts represent amounts estimated as 
being accrued for on-target performance in 
2007; matching shares and performance 
shares percentages are based on estimated 
vesting amounts for on-target performance.
The company maintains contact with its 
principal shareholders on remuneration 
matters as necessary. 
 
Executive directors
The remuneration package for executive 
directors comprises a competitive basic 
salary, a performance-related annual cash 
bonus, share-related incentive schemes, 
pension provision and other benefi ts. In 
determining executive remuneration, the 
committee takes into account pay and 
employment conditions across the group. 
Basic salary
The committee's objective is to ensure that 
the basic salary for each director is 
appropriate and competitive for the 
responsibilities involved. Base salaries are 
reviewed annually with input from

participation in the LTIP is limited to the 
executive directors. As a result of its review 
of the company's executive incentive 
arrangements, the committee is proposing 
a number of changes to these schemes for 
future years, which will be considered by 
the shareholders at the 2006 AGM. These 
proposals are summarised on pages 122 
to 124 where appropriate.
The company is aware of the limits 
included in the guidelines issued by the 
Association of British Insurers (ABI) in 
relation to the percentage of issued share 
capital that can be subject to options to 
subscribe. These guidelines recommend 
that no more than fi ve per cent of the 
issued share capital should be committed 
to options under discretionary schemes 
over a 10-year period and no more than 
10 per cent of the issued capital should be 
committed to options under all schemes 
over a 10-year period. The company's 
current position in respect of these limits 
is set out in table 7.
Chief Executive will be required to invest a 
minimum of 33 per cent of their bonus in 
an SMP that will also allow them to invest 
a further 17 per cent of their bonus. 
Executives who report directly to the Group 
Chief Executive will be eligible for bonus 
payments of up to 36 per cent of base 
salary for on-target performance and up to 
a further 24 per cent of base salary for 
exceptional outperformance against target. 
Other senior managers will be eligible 
for maximum bonus payments of up to 
40 per cent with no requirement to invest 
in the SMP .
Share-related incentives
Executive directors and other senior 
managers are currently entitled to 
participate in the following share-related 
incentive schemes, which are designed to 
link their long-term interests with those of 
the group: the Executive Share Option 
Scheme (ESOS); the Savings-Related 
Share Option Scheme (SRSOS); the Share 
Incentive Plan (SIP); the LTIP . Currently, 
The group's performance targets for 
executive directors, which are agreed by 
the Remuneration Committee, relate to the 
following:
 Growth in the group's underlying 
earnings per share
 Growth in the group's underlying ports 
and transport operating profi ts
 Attainment of group health and safety 
targets.
Senior managers with operational 
responsibilities are assessed on the above 
criteria and, additionally, the attainment of 
return on capital employed targets.
T able 6 provides a summary of the targets 
used to assess the attainment of bonuses 
by Bo Lerenius and Richard Adam under 
the 2005 scheme. Doug Morrison's bonus 
was based on the attainment of 2005 
targets by the Ports of Hull & Goole and the 
Port of Southampton.
The group will pay bonuses in the range 
of nil to 42 per cent of base salaries for 
2005, as it partially achieved its targets in 
relation to growth in underlying earnings 
per share and underlying ports and 
transport operating profi ts and achieved 
its target for reducing reportable injuries 
per thousand employees.
As a result of the 2005 review of 
remuneration practices undertaken by the 
committee in conjunction with New Bridge 
Street Consultants LLP , subject to 
shareholder approval, for 2006 and 
beyond, executive directors will be able to 
earn bonus amounts of up to 60 per cent 
of base salary for on-target performance; 
up to a further 40 per cent of base salary 
will be payable for exceptional 
outperformance against targets. Under the 
proposed plan, executive directors and 
executives who report directly to the Group

* Subject to the overall amount of bonus received by any bonus scheme participant being capped at the maximum percentage noted above, 
amounts paid to all employees are adjusted to refl ect the group's performance in relation to the number of reportable injuries per thousand 
employees suffered by its UK ports and transport operations. Bonus amounts otherwise payable are reduced by 10 per cent for an incidence 
rate of more than 15 and are increased by 10 per cent for an incidence rate of less than 12. No adjustments are made for an incidence rate of 
between 12 and 15.

Associated British Ports Holdings PLC
Options granted under the ESOS in 2002 
did not vest during 2005 as the growth in 
the group's underlying EPS for the three-
year period from 1 January 2002 was below 
the target level required under the scheme 
rules. Under the re-testing provisions, these 
options will also not vest in 2006 and will be 
subject to a second and fi nal retesting in 
February 2007.
Similarly, options granted under the ESOS 
in 2003 will not vest during 2006, as the 
growth in the group's underlying EPS for 
the three-year period from 1 January 2003 
was below the target level required under 
the scheme rules. These options will now 
be retested in February 2007.
The group uses growth in underlying EPS 
as the target for the remaining options held 
by executive directors and other senior 
managers, as this is an indicator that can 
be verifi ed independently and is closely 
aligned to shareholder value. The 
committee reviews the appropriateness of 
the measure and target adopted at the time 
of each grant. Further details of the options 
held by each executive director under the 
ESOS are provided on page 127.
The targets set and actual performance of 
the group in relation to unvested option 
grants are detailed in table 8.
detailed in a circular to be sent to 
shareholders prior to the 2006 AGM seeking 
approval for the proposed changes. 
T o strengthen the link between the interests 
of the company and its directors, the 
company intends to encourage its 
executive directors to accumulate and hold 
shares equivalent to 100 per cent of their 
salaries within fi ve years of the introduction 
of the SMP and the PSP . T o assist with this 
aim, it is anticipated that executive directors 
will retain up to 50 per cent of any future 
post-tax award vesting under the SMP and 
the PSP until the target of 100 per cent 
of basic salary has been achieved. 
 
The target set in relation to the vesting of all 
outstanding ESOS options requires the 
growth of the group's underlying EPS to 
exceed the rate of infl ation by at least three 
per cent per annum for a minimum period of 
three years. For options issued under the 
ESOS prior to 2004, the minimum period 
will be extended by one year at the end of 
the third year and by a further year at the 
end of the fourth year if this target is not 
achieved after three years. If the target has 
not been met by the end of the fi fth year , the 
options will lapse. For options issued under 
the ESOS during and since 2004, the 
options will lapse if the target is not achieved 
after three years. The company introduced 
this change during 2004 in order to align its 
practices with best practice.
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS)
Options are issued annually at a price equal 
to the average of the share prices on the 
fi ve days immediately preceding the date of 
grant. Except in a very limited number of 
circumstances, options granted under the 
ESOS may only be exercised once the 
underlying earnings per share (EPS) target 
has been achieved. Options may also 
become exercisable following a change in 
control of the company; options granted 
before 2005 vest in full on change of 
control. However , for options granted in 
2005 and beyond, options only vest 
following a change of control provided that 
the performance conditions are met over 
the shortened period. 
The value of options granted annually to 
each executive director and senior manager 
is limited to one times their annual base 
salary. Details of grants made to the 
executive directors during the year are set 
out on page 127. The committee has 
proposed that the ESOS be replaced by a 
SMP for executive directors, by a SMP and 
a PSP for executives who report directly to 
the Group Chief Executive and by a PSP for 
all other senior management with effect 
from 2007. Under the PSP , executives who 
report directly to the Group Chief Executive 
and other senior managers could be 
awarded shares with a value of up to 40 per 
cent of their base salary on an annual basis. 
Under the SMP , executive directors and 
executives who report directly to the Group 
Chief Executive will be required to invest 
33 per cent of their annual bonus and may 
voluntarily increase this investment up to an 
overall maximum of 50 per cent of their 
annual bonus into the SMP for three years. 
The company will match this investment by 
between 60 per cent and 200 per cent, 
subject to the attainment of challenging and 
appropriate vesting conditions. Vesting 
conditions for the PSP and SMP will be

period. Thirty per cent of the shares vest 
for attaining a median ranking; 100 per cent 
of the shares vest if the company is ranked 
in the upper decile; there is pro-rata vesting 
for performance between median and 
upper decile. No shares vest for below-
median ranking. The independent 
remuneration consultants manage the 
measurement of performance against 
vesting targets in line with the plan rules 
circulated to shareholders prior to the 
approval of the LTIP in 2003. In the event of 
change of control, the performance period 
ends on the relevant date and the vesting 
of the relevant awards, based on the 
normal criteria, is restricted by reference to 
reduction in the performance period. 
Grants made under the LTIP in 2003 
did not vest, as the group's TSR for the 
three-year period to 31 December 2005 
was below that of the median-ranking 
company within the applicable comparator 
group. During the year, Bo Lerenius, 
Richard Adam and Doug Morrison, 
received conditional awards of shares 
equivalent to their annual base salaries. 
Further details on the number of shares 
issued to each director under the LTIP 
are provided on page 128. T able 9 sets out 
the vesting status of LTIP grants as at 
31 December 2005.
As part of the proposals developed 
following the committee's review of the 
company's incentive arrangements, it is 
intended that the L TIP will be replaced by 
profi t target. Shares awarded under this 
part of the scheme are again held in trust 
for a period of fi ve years prior to vesting.
As the group achieved its underlying pre-tax 
profi t target for the year , awards of  625 
were made to each participating employee 
under the SIP for 2005. The group intends 
to retain the existing structure for the 2006 
grants under the SIP , which will be open 
once again to eligible employees in 2006.
Long-T erm Incentive Plan (L TIP)
The company introduced the LTIP during 
2003 to further strengthen the link between 
the executive directors' remuneration and 
the long-term performance of the group. It 
enables executive directors to receive 
annual share awards of up to 100 per cent 
of their base salary. The vesting of the 
shares is based on the company's 
performance in terms of total shareholder 
return (TSR) compared to the group of 
FTSE companies ranked between 51 and 
150 by market capitalisation, excluding 
companies in the fi nancial, IT and 
telecommunications sectors. The exact list 
of companies is based on the average 
market capitalisation of companies over 
the three months prior to the beginning of 
each performance period. Each 
performance period lasts three years and 
commences at the beginning of the 
fi nancial year in which the award is made. 
TSR is averaged over the six months prior 
to the start and end of each performance 
Savings-Related Share Option Scheme 
(SRSOS)
Under the SRSOS, the company grants 
options to eligible employees, including 
executive directors, at an option price that 
is 20 per cent lower than the market price 
at the date of grant. Employees can elect 
to save up to  250 per month for a period 
of three or fi ve years. At the end of the 
elected savings period, they can use the 
proceeds to acquire shares at the option 
price. The group operates similar plans for 
its employees in the USA. There are no 
performance conditions attached to the 
vesting of options granted under the 
SRSOS. Further details of the options held 
by each executive director under the 
SRSOS are provided on page 127.
Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
Subject to a minimum period of service, all 
UK employees, including executive 
directors, are eligible to participate in the 
SIP . Participating employees can elect to 
purchase up to  125 of shares out of their 
pre-tax and National Insurance salaries per 
month. The shares are allotted to a trustee 
on a monthly basis and held in trust for a 
period of fi ve years prior to vesting.
During 2005, employees had the 
opportunity to elect to be awarded free 
shares worth  125 for the year. The 
scheme also allowed participating 
employees to receive further shares up to a

Other benefi ts
The company provides other benefi ts in 
line with market practice. These include 
medical cover and a company car or cash 
alternative.
Service contracts
The employment contracts of the executive 
directors contain a notice period of one 
year. The board may, if necessary, consider 
initial contract periods in excess of one 
year in the recruitment of new executive 
directors. Any such contracts would revert 
to a one-year notice period on expiry of the 
initial notice period.
In the event of the company facing a claim 
for compensation by an executive director 
for loss of offi ce, the level of compensation 
would be subject to mitigation if considered 
appropriate and legally sustainable. The 
service contracts of existing directors do 
not contain any provisions for pre-
determined compensation. T able 11 sets

a PSP for executive directors during 2006. 
Under the PSP , the executive directors may 
be awarded annual grants of shares up to 
125 per cent of their base salaries, although 
the initial intention is to limit grants up to 100 
per cent of base salaries. Vesting conditions 
for the PSP will be detailed in a circular to be 
sent to shareholders prior to the 2006 AGM 
seeking approval for the proposed changes. 
T otal shareholder return (TSR)
As required by the Directors' Remuneration 
Report Regulations 2002, the graph in 
fi gure 6 sets out the group's TSR 
compared with the FTSE top-250 
comparator group of companies over the 
fi ve-year period to 31 December 2005. 
Remuneration 
report
The company has selected the FTSE-250 
comparator group because its FTSE 
ranking has ranged from 131 to 142 during 
2005. In line with market practice, the 
calculation for TSR assumes reinvestment 
of dividends and is based on data provided 
by Datastream. 
Pension 
The company pays Bo Lerenius 
and Richard Adam a supplement of 
30 per cent of basic salary in lieu 
of pension arrangements. This was 
increased from 25 per cent on 1 January 
2006 following a review of pension 
arrangements by the committee during 
2005. Doug Morrison, executive director, 
is a member of the group's defi ned 
benefi t pension scheme. Following the 
implementation in 2005 of a salary-sacrifi ce 
plan, Doug does not make any 
contributions towards the company's 
pension scheme. Under this arrangement 
Doug's salary from the date of his 
appointment to 31 December 2005 was 
reduced by  6,000 and the company 
contributed this amount into its pension 
scheme on his behalf. Details of 
his pension arrangements are shown in 
table 10. The company does not intend to 
make any changes to the pension-
provision arrangements set out above for 
its directors as a result of the recent 
changes in pensions legislation.

basis. They do not have service contracts. 
The commencement and expected year 
of expiry of each of the non-executive 
directors' current terms are shown in 
table 12.
T o determine the fees it pays to non-
executive directors, the board takes into 
account the need to attract individuals of 
appropriate calibre and expertise, the fees 
paid to non-executive directors by other 
companies of a similar size and the time 
commitment attached to each 
appointment. The board keeps fees under 
review. Non-executive directors do not 
participate in the performance-related 
annual bonus, any of the group's equity-
linked remuneration plans or pension 
arrangements.
Full details of the committee memberships 
held by the non-executive directors are set 
out in table 1 on page 108. All non-
executive directors sit on the Audit, 
Nomination and Remuneration committees 
with the exception of Chris Clark, who 
does not sit on the Audit Committee or the 
Remuneration Committee, as he is not 
considered to be independent under the 
updated Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance. Following the publication of 
the updated Combined Code, the board 
considered whether it would be 
External appointments
The group believes that the experience 
gained by executive directors through their 
involvement with other companies has the 
potential to be benefi cial to both the 
individual and the group. The group's policy 
on external appointments is to allow 
executive directors to accept one external 
non-executive appointment as long as the 
time commitments involved do not 
undermine the performance of their duties. 
During 2004, Bo Lerenius, who had been 
appointed as non-executive director for 
Group 4 Securicor plc in 2003, was 
permitted to accept a second non-
executive appointment with Land Securities 
plc. The approval for this second 
appointment was considered and granted 
by the Chairman in conjunction with the 
independent non-executive directors. It is 
anticipated that, except for their existing 
commitments, the executive directors 
will not be permitted to take on any further 
external appointments. Directors are 
permitted to retain any fees earned 
through such appointments. Fees earned 
by Bo Lerenius and Richard Adam from 
external appointments for the year ending 
31 December 2005 amounted to  86,000 
and  35,000, respectively. Further details of 
current appointments held by executive 
directors are set out in their biographies 
on pages 100 and 101.
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors are appointed 
to the board for an initial term of three 
years and are permitted to offer themselves 
for re-election for subsequent terms of up 
to three years. Non-executive directors 
who have served on the board for a period 
in excess of nine years are required to offer 
themselves for re-election on an annual 
appropriate to make additional payments 
to non-executive directors for their 
membership of these committees. It 
concluded that it was appropriate to pay 
the respective chairmen of the Audit and 
Remuneration committees an additional 
 7,500 a year, but that it was not 
appropriate to make additional payments 
to other committee members. Fees paid to 
non-executive directors were reviewed by 
the board in September 2005 and will next 
be reviewed during 2007. 
A breakdown of the composition of the 
fees earned by non-executive directors 
is provided in table 13.
