 12 REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee has been chaired by Dr Barry
Price throughout the year. The committee also includes
Dr John Brown, David Lee and Ron Long each of whom
were members throughout the year.
The remuneration committee has the responsibility for
determining the Group's overall policy on executive
remuneration and for deciding the specific remuneration,
benefits and terms of employment for executive directors. The
remuneration committee also has regard to remuneration
packages for senior executives who are not board directors,
but have a significant influence over the Group's ability to meet
its strategic objectives. Fees paid to the Chairman and non-
executive directors are determined by the board as a whole
and no director is responsible for approving his own
remuneration. The remuneration committee, in its deliberations
on the remuneration policy for the Company's directors, seeks
to give full consideration to the Combined Code including the
provisions set out in Schedule A to the Code.
During the year, the Acting Chief Executive Officer and the
Human Resources Manager provided information to assist
the remuneration committee in its consideration of
remuneration related matters. This information included
market data on salaries and executive compensation and
advice relating to the various share incentive schemes
operated by the Group. The remuneration committee also
utilised salary surveys prepared by New Bridge Street
Consultants LLP and Alan Jones Associates. During 2005
the Group's Acting Chief Executive Officer attended
meetings of the remuneration committee and was invited to
comment on proposals, except those concerning his own
remuneration. The Company Secretary acted as Secretary to
the remuneration committee.
In the year under review Dr Chris Moyses was a non-
executive director of Senexis Limited and Ketocytonyx Inc
and received remuneration of  25,000 from these companies
for his services during 2005. None of the other executive
directors held non-executive director positions with other
companies where they received any remuneration.
Policy on directors' remuneration
This section of the Remuneration Report covers the policies
set by the remuneration committee. Detailed disclosure of
directors' remuneration for the year ended 31 December
2005 together with disclosure of share ownership and
entitlement to share options is set out on pages 16 to 17.
The policies set by the remuneration committee are intended
to attract and retain high calibre executives, to motivate them
to build a successful company and seek to maximise
shareholder value. Remuneration committee policies and
procedures also aim to ensure that executive directors receive
remuneration appropriate to their performance, experience,
responsibility and geographic location without paying more
than appropriate in the circumstances. The remuneration
committee will also take into account the transition to
International Accounting Standards when determining
director's remuneration, with the overriding aim being to
provide a consistent measurement of performance.
The Group operates in a dynamic business sector. The
remuneration committee's policies aim to align business
strategy and corporate objectives with executive
remuneration. Certain policies may need to be adjusted from
time to time in order to ensure the appropriate mix between
performance based and non-performance based elements
and between long and short-term goals and rewards,
depending upon the challenges facing the business and its
objectives at any given point in its development. Where
major changes in remuneration policy may be required, the
remuneration committee would expect to discuss these with
key shareholders in advance.
Executive directors' remuneration packages are comprised
of a basic annual salary, a performance related bonus and
other customary benefits such as pension contributions and
health insurance together with long-term incentive
arrangements in the form of share options and share
incentive plans. The board believes that incentives such as
share options and the share incentive plans serve a valuable
role in motivating executive directors and employees to act
in the interests of creating shareholder value.
Basic salary
The basic salary of each executive director is determined by
the remuneration committee taking into account individual
performance and aims to ensure that remuneration remains
competitive with similar companies in terms of size and
complexity. Basic salary levels for executives are designed
to be at least at the median level reflecting the levels of
performance, experience and responsibility held by each of
the executive directors.
Remuneration Report ASTERAND : PHARMAGENE 13
Performance bonus
Each executive director is eligible for a discretionary annual
bonus in recognition of that director's contribution to the
success of the Group and the achievement of specified
performance targets. These performance targets include a
combination of corporate and individual objectives except
for the Chief Executive Officer whose bonus is based entirely
on the achievement of corporate objectives.
The targeted composition of each director's remuneration
excluding share options and shares acquired under the
Performance Share Plan for those directors who have served
during the year is as follows:
Executive directors at 31 December 2005
Basic salary, pension Performance
and other benefits bonus
R A Coleman 70% 30%
5555555 5555555
C Moyses 70% 30%
5555555 5555555
J Murphy 70% 30%
5555555 5555555
J R Openshaw 67% 33%
Pension and other benefits
The Group contributes a sum equal to a fixed proportion of
basic salary to a defined contribution pension scheme on
behalf of each executive director (and participating
employees) each month. The Group funds the provision of
private medical insurance for executive directors and their
immediate family and funds permanent health insurance and
life assurance cover (four times salary) for executives.
Executive directors are also provided with a mobile phone
for business and personal use. Company cars are not
provided to directors or staff.
Share options
All executive directors and employees are eligible for grants
of share options based on a proportion of salary. In order to
promote sustained performance, the remuneration
committee gives consideration annually to the grant of share
options. Share options are granted at the closing mid-
market value of the Company's ordinary shares on the day
prior to grant and vest with the director or employee after a
period of three years, subject to demanding performance
targets related to the primary strategic objectives of the
Group. Before its flotation, the Group operated schemes
which included a mixture of performance based and time
based criteria which needed to be met before share options
could be exercised. Details of shares under option are set
out on page 17.
Share Incentive Plan
The Company's intention is to encourage share ownership at
all levels of the business, thereby aligning all employees'
interests with those of the shareholders. Accordingly, the
Company introduced the Pharmagene plc 2002 Inland
Revenue Approved Share Incentive Plan (the SIP ) in 2003.
All executive directors and eligible employees may
participate in the SIP which contains three elements:
partnership shares, matching shares and free shares (known
internally as Corporate Bonus Shares).
Partnership shares may be purchased by employees out of
their pre-tax salary up to  1,500 (or 10% of salary if lower)
per year. Where employees purchase partnership shares,
they can be awarded additional matching shares at no
additional cost to the employee. Under the rules of the SIP ,
the directors are given discretion to determine the ratio of
partnership shares to matching shares. The ratio is currently
1:1. During the year 81,430 partnership and 81,430 matching
shares were allocated in aggregate to 44 eligible employees
under the SIP . Free shares may be distributed to eligible
employees with a maximum market value of  3,000 per
employee per year. For the year ended 31 December 2005,
no awards of free shares were made.
Performance Share Plan
The Performance Share Plan was introduced in May 2004.
Under the Performance Share Plan, selected individuals may
receive a conditional right to receive shares, which will
normally vest after three years, subject to continued
employment and the achievement of stretching performance
conditions. The performance conditions applying to the
shares subject to an award will be determined by the
remuneration committee prior to any awards being made
and will be a mix of challenging share price growth targets
for half of the shares and total shareholder return for the
other half of the shares. The total shareholder return
condition will measure the Company's total shareholder
return against a defined comparator group comprising UK
listed biotechnology/pharmaceutical companies. The
committee believes that the Performance Share Plan
represents a sensible long-term incentive arrangement
which is not excessive, is cost effective for the Company
taking account of both share usage and the new
accounting treatment of share schemes and will mean that a
significant but not excessive proportion of the executive's
remuneration will be linked to a requirement to generate
superior returns to shareholders. During 2005 awards over
1,156,189 shares were made under the Performance Share
Plan, of these 1,074,151 were made to directors as shown
on page 17. 14 REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006
The remuneration committee intends to consider awards under the Performance Share Plan to executive directors and vice
presidents on an annual basis. The arrangements referred to above under the Share Incentive Plan will continue in 2006. The
remuneration committee intends that further grants of share options under the share option schemes will be considered only
on a case by case basis.
The committee has also introduced share ownership guidelines in which executive directors will be expected to retain no
fewer than 50% of shares that vest under the Performance Share Plan (net of tax) until such time as a shareholding worth
25% of salary is achieved.
Executive directors' service contracts
All executive directors' service contracts are rolling contracts, terminable by either party on not less than 12 months' written
notice. In the event of a material breach of contract or gross misconduct by the executive director, the Company may terminate
the employment by written notice having immediate effect.
The details of the service contracts of those executive directors who served during the year are:

Non-executive directors' letters of appointment
Non-executive directors have signed letters of appointment terminable on three months' written notice from either party. Non-
executive directors receive fees for services as members of the board to reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of
the role. Dr Barry Price held options to subscribe for shares in the Company details of which are set out on page 17. Dr Price
exercised these options in full on 4 April 2006. None of the Company's non-executive directors participate in the Group's
current share option or share incentive schemes.
The details of the letters of appointment of those non-executive directors who served during the year are:

The graphs above show the Company's share price performance compared with the performance of the FTSE All Share Index
since the Company's listing in August 2000 and the UK techMark Mediscience Index since 2 November 2001, when the
techMark Mediscience index was launched. The remuneration committee believes the UK techMark Mediscience Index to be
the most appropriate index against which Asterand should be measured. Until five years of comparative performance for this
index is available, the remuneration committee will continue to show performance against it and the FTSE All Share Index.

NOTES
1 Share options granted prior to flotation, no performance conditions attached.
2 Share options granted prior to and at flotation, performance conditions fulfilled.
3 Performance conditions were set relating to revenue and share price growth over the three financial years ended 31 December 2003. Of the share options
granted one third vested and two thirds lapsed.
4 Performance conditions were set relating to revenue growth over the three years ended 31 December 2004. All performance conditions were met and all
options vested.
5 Performance conditions were set relating to revenue or share price growth for the three years ending 31 December 2005. The performance conditions have
not been met and these options will therefore lapse in their entirety during 2006.
