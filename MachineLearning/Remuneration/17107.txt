 10 REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee has been chaired by Mr Long
throughout the year. The committee also includes Mr Davis
and Mr Jones each of whom were members throughout the
year.
The remuneration committee has the responsibility for
determining the Group's overall policy on executive
remuneration and for deciding the specific remuneration,
benefits and terms of employment for executive directors.
The remuneration committee also has regard to
remuneration packages for senior executives who are not
board directors, but have a significant influence over the
Group's ability to meet its strategic objectives. Fees paid to
the Chairman and non-executive directors are determined by
the board as a whole and no director is responsible for
approving his own remuneration. The remuneration
committee, in its deliberations on the remuneration policy for
the Company's directors, seeks to give full consideration to
the Combined Code including the provisions set out in
Schedule A to the Code. The Company Secretary acts as
secretary to the remuneration committee.
At the start of 2006 the board determined that it would hold
salary and compensation for the executive directors at 2005
levels. Consequently, there has been no benchmarking
exercise during 2006.
Policy on directors' remuneration
This section of the remuneration report covers the policies
set by the remuneration committee. Detailed disclosure of
directors' remuneration for the year ended 31 December
2006 together with disclosure of share ownership and
entitlement to share options is set out on pages 13 to 17.
The policies set by the remuneration committee are intended
to attract and retain high calibre executives, to motivate
them to build a successful company and seek to maximise
shareholder value. Remuneration committee policies and
procedures also aim to ensure that executive directors
receive remuneration appropriate to their performance,
experience, responsibility and geographic location without
paying more than appropriate in the circumstances.
The Group operates in a dynamic business sector. 
The remuneration committee's policies aim to align business
strategy and corporate objectives with executive
remuneration. Certain policies may need to be adjusted from
time to time in order to ensure the appropriate mix between
performance based and non-performance based elements
and between long and short-term goals and rewards,
depending upon the challenges facing the business and its
objectives at any given point in its development. 
Where major changes in remuneration policy may be
required, the remuneration committee would expect to
discuss these with key shareholders in advance.
Executive directors' remuneration packages are comprised
of a basic annual salary, a performance related bonus and
other customary benefits such as pension contributions and
health insurance together with long-term incentive
arrangements in the form of share options and share
incentive plans. The board believes that incentives such as
share options and the share incentive plans serve a valuable
role in motivating executive directors and employees to act
in the interests of creating shareholder value.
Basic salary
The basic salary of each executive director is determined by
the remuneration committee taking into account individual
performance and aims to ensure that remuneration remains
competitive with similar companies in terms of size and
complexity. Basic salary levels for executives are designed
to be at least at the median level reflecting the levels of
performance, experience and responsibility held by each of
the executive directors.
Performance bonus
Each executive director is eligible for a discretionary annual
bonus in recognition of that director's contribution to the
success of the Group and the achievement of specified
performance targets. These performance targets include a
combination of corporate and individual objectives except
for the Chief Executive Officer whose bonus is based entirely
on the achievement of corporate objectives.
The targeted composition of each director's remuneration
excluding share options and shares acquired under the
Performance Share Plan for those directors who have served
during the year is as follows:

Pension and other benefits
The Group contributes a sum equal to a fixed proportion of
basic salary to a defined contribution pension scheme on
behalf of each executive director (and participating
employees) each month. The Group funds the provision of
private medical insurance for executive directors and their
immediate family and funds permanent health insurance and
life assurance cover (four times salary) for executives.
Executive directors are also provided with a mobile phone
for business and personal use. Company cars are not
provided to directors or staff.
Share options
All executive directors and employees are eligible for grants
of share options based on a proportion of salary. In order to
promote sustained performance, the remuneration
committee gives consideration annually to the grant of 
share options. Share options are granted at the closing 
mid-market value of the Company's ordinary shares on the
day prior to grant and vest with the director or employee
after a period of three years, subject to demanding
performance targets related to the primary strategic
objectives of the Group. Before the original IPO of
Pharmagene plc in 2000, the Group operated schemes
which included a mixture of performance based and time
based criteria which needed to be met before share options
could be exercised. Details of shares under option are set
out on pages 15 to 17.
Share Incentive Plan
The Company's intention is to encourage share ownership at
all levels of the business, thereby aligning all employees'
interests with those of the shareholders. Accordingly, the
Company introduced the Pharmagene plc 2002 Inland
Revenue Approved Share Incentive Plan (the SIP ) in 2003.
All executive directors and eligible employees may
participate in the SIP which contains three elements:
partnership shares, matching shares and free shares (known
internally as Corporate Bonus Shares).
Partnership shares may be purchased by employees out of
their pre-tax salary up to  1,500 (or 10% of salary if lower)
per year. Where employees purchase partnership shares,
they can be awarded additional matching shares at no
additional cost to the employee. Under the rules of the SIP ,
the directors are given discretion to determine the ratio of
partnership shares to matching shares. The ratio is currently
1:1. During the year 169,488 partnership and 169,488
matching shares were allocated in aggregate to 25 eligible
employees under the SIP . Free shares may be distributed to
eligible employees with a maximum market value of  3,000
per employee per year. For the year ended 31 December
2006, no awards of free shares were made.
Performance Share Plan
The Performance Share Plan was introduced in May 2004.
Under the Performance Share Plan, selected individuals may
receive a conditional right to receive shares, which will
normally vest after three years, subject to continued
employment and the achievement of stretching performance
conditions. The performance conditions applying to the
shares subject to an award will be determined by the
remuneration committee prior to any awards being made
and will be a mix of challenging share price growth targets
for half of the shares and total shareholder return for the
other half of the shares. The total shareholder return
condition will measure the Company's total shareholder
return against a defined comparator group comprising UK
listed biotechnology/pharmaceutical companies. 
The committee believes that the Performance Share Plan
represents a sensible long-term incentive arrangement which
is not excessive, is cost effective for the Company taking
account of both share usage and the new accounting
treatment of share schemes and will mean that a significant
but not excessive proportion of the executive's remuneration
will be linked to a requirement to generate superior returns
to shareholders. During 2006 no awards were made under
the Performance Share Plan.
In 2005 awards were made over 1,156,189 shares, of which
1,074,151 were made to directors. Following the
restructuring of the board, certain board members and other
senior managers resigned or were made redundant. At that
time the performance criteria associated with the awards
were reviewed and the remuneration committee considered
that the performance criteria had not been met.
Consequently, on 3 January 2006 awards over 1,067,251
shares lapsed, including 813,558 shares to directors.
0622_Asterand p10_21  13/3/07  20:21  Page 11 12 REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006
Upon establishment of the scheme the committee introduced share ownership guidelines in which executive directors will be
expected to retain no fewer than 50% of shares that vest under the Performance Share Plan (net of tax) until such time as a
shareholding worth 25% of salary is achieved.
Basis of preparation of the Remuneration Report
The Remuneration Report has been prepared on the basis of those persons who were legally directors of Asterand plc during
2006. The comparative figures for 2005 are prepared on the same basis. The financial statements of the Group have been
prepared in accordance with IFRS 3. Consequently, comparatives in the financial statements contain reference to amounts
relating to Asterand, Inc. pre-merger. As a result historic information in the Remuneration Report and the financial statements
are not necessarily directly comparable.
Executive directors' service contracts
All executive directors' service contracts are rolling contracts, terminable by either party on not less than 12 months' written
notice. In the event of a material breach of contract or gross misconduct by the executive director, the Company may terminate
the employment by written notice having immediate effect.
The details of the service contracts of those executive directors who served during the year are:

Non-executive directors' letters of appointment
Non-executive directors have signed letters of appointment terminable on three months' written notice from either party.
Non-executive directors receive fees for services as members of the board to reflect the time commitment and responsibilities
of the role. Dr Barry Price held options to subscribe for shares in the Company details of which are set out on page 16.
Dr Price exercised these options in full on 4 April 2006. None of the Company's non-executive directors participate in the
Group's current share option or share incentive schemes.

The graph above shows the Company's share price performance compared with the performance of the FTSE All Share Index
since the Company's listing in August 2000 and the UK techMark Mediscience Index since 1 January 2002. The remuneration
committee believes the UK techMark Mediscience Index to be the most appropriate index against which Asterand should be
measured. Until five years of comparative performance for this index is available, the remuneration committee will continue to
show performance against it and the FTSE All Share Index.

For the year ended 31 December 2006, no bonuses were awarded to any executive directors. The Group contributed 12%
(2005: 12%) of basic salary to a defined contribution pension scheme for each UK based executive director until 31 October
2006. From 1 November 2006 the Company changed its pension provider and reduced the contribution to 9%. Benefits in
kind include private medical insurance for executive directors and their immediate family, permanent health insurance, life
assurance cover and a mobile phone for business and personal use.
On 31 July 2006 the Company announced that it would seek to identify a successor for Mr Charlton. At the same time the
Company reached an agreement with Mr Charlton that he would work until a successor was found and that upon his
departure he would be paid $160,000 equivalent to his salary in lieu of 12 months' notice. In addition, he would receive a
consultancy agreement for the provision of services to the Company for up to 75 days consulting at a rate of  750 per day.
Further, as an incentive he would be given a bonus upon departure to be settled by the issuance to him of 100,000 ordinary
shares. Such shares are required to be held by him for a period of 3 years post award.
0622_Asterand p10_21  13/3/07  20:21  Page 14 On 2 March 2007 the Company announced that Mr Openshaw would stand down as CFO and Company Secretary following
the announcement of the financial results for the year ended 31 December 2006. Although the agreement was not reached
relating to his departure until this time, negotiations with Mr Openshaw had commenced in 2006. Under a compromise
agreement entered into with Mr Openshaw he will receive a payment of his salary of  158,362 together with associated
benefits equivalent to his 12 month notice period.
The amounts to be paid to Mr Charlton and Mr Openshaw will not be made until their resignation in 2007. However, under IAS
37 the Directors have concluded that in both cases a constructive obligation existed at 31 December 2006 such that the
amounts to be paid should be recorded as a liability in 2006; accordingly a provision has been made in the 2006 accounts.
As neither of these amounts were paid to these directors during 2006 they have been excluded from the table above on
page 14.
Interests in share options
There were no grants of share options to any director during the year. Details of the interests of directors, who held office
during the year, in share options and awards made under the performance share plan are set out below.
Each of Mr Openshaw, Dr Coleman, Dr Price, Mr Murphy and Dr Moyses had interests in share options over shares in
Asterand plc. These are disclosed in the table - Interests in options over shares in Asterand plc  on page 16.
Each of Mr Charlton, Mr Cullinane, Mr Davis and Mr Stefanelli had interests in share options over shares in Asterand, Inc.
These are disclosed in the table - Interests in options over shares in Asterand, Inc  on page 17. This discloses the interests
over shares in Asterand, Inc. and not Asterand plc. The merger agreement between Pharmagene plc (renamed Asterand plc)
and Asterand, Inc. provides for the adoption of these share options and, generally, the conversion into shares of Asterand plc
at the ratio of 7.59 Asterand plc shares for each share of Asterand, Inc. This is subject to a mechanism which provides for an
adjustment in the event that shares would be issued at less than nominal value which may give rise to the increase of the call
under the option and an increase in the number of shares allotted providing the economic effect is maintained. Mr Davis
exercised an option over 30,000 shares in Asterand, Inc. which gave rise to the issuance to him of 285,472 ordinary shares in
Asterand plc. In addition, Mr Charlton exercised an option over 15,174 Asterand, Inc shares and received 170,488 ordinary
shares in Asterand plc.
None of the other directors, being Mr Lee, Mr Jones, Mr Long, Dr Brown, and Ms Sooch, had any interest in share options in
the Company.

NOTES
1 Share options granted prior to flotation, no performance conditions attached.
2 Share options granted prior to and at flotation, performance conditions fulfilled.
3 Where average revenue growth exceeds 30%, 60% or 90% over the three financial years following the year ended 31 December 2000, one-third, two-thirds
and all, respectively, of the share options become exercisable or where average year on year share price growth per annum exceeds 30%, 60% or 90% over
the three years following the date of grant, one-third, two-thirds and all, respectively, of the share options become exercisable.
4 Where average revenue growth exceeds 5%, 10% or 15% over the three financial years following the year ended 31 December 2001, one-third, two-thirds
and all, respectively, of the share options become exercisable or where average year on year share price growth per annum exceeds 5%, 10% or 15% over
the three years following the date of grant, one-third, two-thirds and all, respectively, of the share options become exercisable.
5 Where average revenue or share price growth exceeds 10% over the three financial years following the year ended 31 December 2002 or the date of grant
respectively, the share options shall become exercisable.
6 50% of the grant (Part A) will be considered against share price growth targets. The extent to which Part A may become exercisable depends on the extent
to which, over any period of 50 consecutive  business days over the performance period the average price of an ordinary share in the Company exceeds a
price 24% higher than the average price of an ordinary share over the 50 consecutive business days prior to grant. 50% of the grant (Part B) will be
considered against total shareholder return (TSR ) performance conditions. At the end of the relevant period, the Company's TSR performance will be
compared with those of the companies making up the chosen comparator group. The performance period is 3 years.
In relation to the share price trigger in notes 3, 4 and 5, where a share price threshold has been reached for a minimum of 20
consecutive trading days over the three year period, the threshold will be regarded as having been met for the purpose of
exercising share options.
