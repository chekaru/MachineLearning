Asterand plc Annual Report and  Financial Statements 2007
Unaudited information
For the year ended 31 December 2007
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee  was chaired by Mr Long throughout the year. The committee  includes Mr Davis and Mr Jones, each of whom were 
members throughout the year.
The remuneration committee has the responsibility for determining the Group's overall policy on executive remuneration and for deciding the 
specific  remuneration, benefits and terms of employment for executive directors. The remuneration committee also has regard to remuneration 
packages for senior executives who are not board directors, but have a significant influence over the Group's ability to meet its strategic objectives. 
Fees paid to the Chairman and non-executive directors are determined by the board as a whole and no director is responsible for approving his 
own remuneration. The remuneration committee, in its deliberations on the remuneration policy for the Company's directors, seeks to give full 
consideration to the Combined Code including the provisions set out in Schedule A to the Code. The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the 
remuneration committee.
 The remuneration committee performs a benchmarking exercise in determining compensation prior to the appointment of any executive director.
Policy on directors' remuneration
This section of the remuneration report covers the policies set by the remuneration committee. Detailed disclosure of directors' remuneration for the 
year ended 31 December 2007 together with disclosure of share ownership and entitlement to share options is set out on pages  17 to  19.
The policies set by the remuneration committee are intended to attract and retain high calibre executives, to motivate them to build a successful 
company and seek to maximise shareholder value. Remuneration committee policies and procedures also aim to ensure that executive directors 
receive remuneration appropriate to their performance, experience, responsibility and geographic location without paying more than appropriate in 
the circumstances.
The Group operates in a dynamic business sector. The remuneration committee's policies aim to align business strategy and corporate objectives 
with executive remuneration. Certain policies may need to be adjusted from time to time in order to ensure  appropriate mix between performance 
based and non-performance based elements and between long and short-term goals and rewards, depending upon the challenges facing the 
business and its objectives at any given point in its development.
Where major changes in remuneration policy may be required, the remuneration committee would expect to discuss these with key shareholders 
in  ad vance .
Executive directors' remuneration packages are comprised of a basic annual salary, a performance related bonus and other customary benefits such 
as pension contributions and health insurance together with long-term incentive arrangements in the form of share options and share incentive plans. 
The board believes that incentives such as share options and the share incentive plans serve a valuable role in motivating executive directors and 
employees to act in the interests of creating shareholder value.

Governance Financial Statements Business Overview
Basic salary
The basic salary of each executive director is determined by the remuneration committee taking into account individual performance and aims to 
ensure that remuneration remains competitive with similar companies in terms of size and complexity . Basic salary levels for executives are designed 
to be at least at the median level reflecting the levels of performance, experience and responsibility held by each of the executive directors.
Performance bonus
Each executive director is eligible for a discretionary annual bonus in recognition of that director's contribution to the success of the Group and the 
achievement of specified performance targets. These performance targets include a combination of corporate and individual objectives except for the 
Chief Executive Officer whose bonus is based entirely on the achievement of corporate objectives.
The targeted composition of each director's remuneration excluding share options and shares acquired under the Performance Share Plan for those 
directors who have served during the year is as follows:
 Executive directors for the year ending  31 December 2007
 Basic salary, pension and  Performance
 other benefits    Bonus
M Coombs 70%  30%
R C J Charlton* 60%  40%
J R Openshaw** 67%  33%
* On 28 March 2007, being the date of resignation
** On  14 March 2007, being the date of resignation
 The Group contributes a sum equal to a fixed proportion of basic salary to a defined contribution pension scheme on behalf of each executive 
director (and participating employees) each month. The Group funds the provision of private medical insurance for executive directors and their 
immediate family and funds permanent health insurance and life assurance cover for executives. Executive directors are also provided with a mobile 
phone for business and personal use. Company cars are not provided to directors or staff.
Share options
All executive directors and employees are eligible for grants of share options based on a proportion of salary . In order to promote sustained 
performance, the remuneration committee gives consideration annually to the grant of share options. Executive share options are granted at the 
closing mid-market value of the Company's ordinary shares on the day of grant, have no performance criteria and vest with the director after three 
years. All shares issued under the 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan are granted at a nil cost and cliff vest with the director or employee after a period 
of three years. All options issued to senior management under this scheme are subject to demanding performance targets related to the primary 
strategic objectives of the Group including positive EBITDA growth. Details of shares under option are set out on pages  17 to  19.
Share Incentive Plan
The Company's intention is to encourage share ownership at all levels of the business, thereby aligning all employees' interests with those of the 
shareholders. Accordingly, the Company introduced the Pharmagene plc 2002 Inland Revenue Approved Share Incentive Plan (the SIP ) in 2003. 
All executive directors and eligible employees may participate in the SIP which co ntains three elements: partnership shares, matching shares and 
free shares (known internally as Corporate Bonus Shares).
Partnership shares may be purchased by employees out of their pre-tax salary up to  1,500 (or 10% of salary if lower) per year . Where employees 
purchase partnership shares, they can be awarded additional matching shares at no additional cost to the employee. Under the rules of the SIP , the 
directors are given discretion to determine the ratio of partnership shares to matching shares. The ratio is currently 1:1. During the year 229,435 
partnership and 229,435 matching shares were allocated in aggregate to eligible employees under the SIP . Free shares may be distributed to eligible 
employees with a maximum market value of  3,000 per employee per year . For the year ended 31 December 2007, no awards of free shares were made. Governance Financial Statements Business Overview

Long term incentive plan
The Long Term Incentive Plan was introduced in May 2007 (the 2007 LTIP ). Under the 2007 LTIP , selected individuals may receive a conditional 
right to receive shares, which cliff vest after three years and are subject to continued employment. Shares issued to senior management under the 
2007 LTIP are subject to the achievement of stretching performance conditions. The performance conditions applying to the shares subject to an 
award will be determined by the remuneration committee prior to any awards being made and will be a mix of challenging share price growth targets 
and profitability targets.
The committee believes that the 2007 LTIP represents a sensible long-term incentive arrangement which is not excessive, is cost effective for the 
Company taking account of both share usage and the new accounting treatment of share schemes and will mean that a significant but not excessive 
proportion of the executive's remuneration will be linked to a requirement to generate superior returns to shareholders. During 2007, the rights over 
4.4 million shares were awarded under this plan.
  Executive Directors' Service Contracts
All executive directors' service contracts are rolling contracts, terminable by either party on not less than 12 months' written notice. In the event of 
a material breach of contract or gross misconduct by the executive director, the Company may terminate the employment by written notice having 
immediate effect.
The details of the service contracts of those executive directors who served during the year are:

J R Openshaw 14 June 2004 4 Feb 2005 Rolling 1 year 1 year's salary and associated benefits in kind
Non-executive directors' letters of appointment
Non-executive directors have signed letters of appointment terminable on three months' written notice from either party . Non-executive directors receive fees for 
services as members of the board to reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of the role. None of the Company's non-executive directors participate in 
the Group's current share option or share incentive schemes.

The graph above shows the Company's share price performance compared with the performance of the UK techMark Mediscience Index. The 
performance of the Group is presented since January 2006, the date that Asterand Inc. and Pharmagene plc merged to form Asterand plc because 
the enlarged Group is considered to be substantially different and not comparable to Pharmagene plc only, as a stand alone entity, prior to 2006. The 
remuneration committee believes the UK techMark Mediscience Index to be the most appropriate index against which Asterand should be measured.
