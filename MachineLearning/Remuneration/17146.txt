Asterand plc - Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
Unaudited information
For the year ended 31 December 2008
Remuneration committee
At the beginning of 2008, the remuneration committee was chaired by 
Ronald Long and included Jack Davis and David Jones. On 18 February, 
in conjunction with his resignation from the Board of Directors, 
Ronald Long vacated his chair and membership of the committee. On 
27 August 2008, Peter Coggins and Ian Ratcliffe joined the committee 
and Peter Coggins was appointed chair. On 2 September 2008, in 
conjunction with his resignation from the Board of Directors, David 
Jones vacated his membership on this committee. 
The remuneration committee has the responsibility for determining the 
Group's overall policy on Executive remuneration and for deciding the 
specific remuneration, benefits and terms of employment for Executive 
Directors. The remuneration committee also has regard to remuneration 
packages for senior executives who are not Board Directors, but have 
a significant influence over the Group's ability to meet its strategic 
objectives. Fees paid to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are 
determined by the Board as a whole and no Director is responsible for 
approving his or her own remuneration. The remuneration committee, in 
its deliberations on the remuneration policy for the Company's Directors, 
seeks to give full consideration to the Combined Code, including the 
provisions set out in Schedule A to the Code. The Company Secretary 
acts as secretary to the remuneration committee.
The remuneration committee performs a benchmarking exercise 
in determining compensation prior to the appointment of any 
Executive Director.
Policy on Directors' remuneration
This section of the remuneration report covers the policies set by the 
remuneration committee. Detailed disclosure of Directors' remuneration 
for the year ended 31 December 2008 together with disclosure of share 
ownership and entitlement to share options is set out on pages 20 
to 22.
The policies set by the remuneration committee are intended to attract 
and retain high calibre executives, to motivate them to build a successful 
company and seek to maximise shareholder value. Remuneration 
committee policies and procedures also aim to ensure that Executive 
Directors receive remuneration appropriate to their performance, 
experience, responsibility and geographic location without paying more 
than appropriate in the circumstances.
The Group operates in a dynamic business sector. The remuneration 
committee's policies aim to align business strategy and corporate 
objectives with Executive remuneration. Certain policies may need 
to be adjusted from time to time in order to ensure appropriate mix 
between performance based and non-performance based elements and 
between long and short-term goals and rewards, depending upon the 
challenges facing the business and its objectives at any given point in 
its development.
Where major changes in remuneration policy may be required, the 
remuneration committee would expect to discuss these with key 
shareholders in advance.
Executive Directors' remuneration packages are comprised of a basic 
annual salary, a performance related bonus and other customary 
benefits such as pension contributions and health insurance together 
with long-term incentive arrangements in the form of share options and 
share incentive plans. The Board believes that incentives such as share 
Directors' Remuneration Report
options and the share incentive plans serve a valuable role in motivating 
Executive Directors and employees to act in the interests of creating 
shareholder value.
Basic salary
The basic salary of each Executive Director is determined by the 
remuneration committee taking into account individual performance 
and aims to ensure that remuneration remains competitive with 
similar companies in terms of size and complexity. Basic salary levels 
for Executive Directors are designed to be at least at the median level 
reflecting the levels of performance, experience and responsibility held 
by each of the Executive Directors.
Performance bonus
Each Executive Director is eligible for a discretionary annual bonus 
in recognition of that Director's contribution to the success of the 
Group and the achievement of specified performance targets. These 
performance targets include a combination of corporate and individual 
objectives except for the Chief Executive Officer whose bonus is based 
entirely on the achievement of corporate objectives.
The targeted composition of each Director's remuneration 
excluding share options and shares acquired under the 
Performance Share Plan for those Directors who have served 
during the year is as follows:
Executive directors for the year ending 31 December 2008
 
Basic salary, pension 
and other benefits
 
Performance
 Bonus
  
M Coombs 70%
 
30%
The Group contributes a sum equal to a fixed proportion of basic salary 
to a defined contribution pension scheme on behalf of each Executive 
Director (and participating employees) each month. The Group funds 
the provision of private medical insurance for Executive Directors and 
their immediate family and funds permanent health insurance and life 
assurance cover for Executives. Executive Directors are also provided 
with a mobile phone for business and personal use. Company cars are 
not provided to Directors or staff.
Share options
All Executive Directors and employees are eligible for grants of share 
options based on a proportion of salary. In order to promote sustained 
performance, the remuneration committee gives consideration annually 
to the grant of share options. Executive share options are granted at the 
closing mid-market value of the Company's Ordinary Shares on the day 
of grant, have no performance criteria and vest with the Director after 
three years. All shares issued under the 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan 
are granted at a nil cost, and cliff vest with the Director or employee 
after a period of three years. All options issued to senior management 
under this scheme are subject to performance targets related to the 
primary strategic objectives of the Group including positive EBITDA 
growth. Details of shares under option are set out on pages 20 to 22. 18
Asterand plc - Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
Share Incentive Plan
The Company's intention is to encourage share ownership at all levels 
of the business, thereby aligning all employees' interests with those of 
the shareholders. Accordingly, the Company introduced the Pharmagene 
plc 2002 Inland Revenue Approved Share Incentive Plan (the SIP ) in 
2003. All Executive Directors and eligible employees may participate in 
the SIP which contains three elements: partnership shares, matching 
shares and free shares (known internally as Corporate Bonus Shares).
Partnership shares may be purchased by employees out of their pre-
tax salary up to  1,500 (or 10% of salary if lower) per year. Where 
employees purchase partnership shares, they can be awarded additional 
matching shares at no additional cost to the employee. Under the rules 
of the SIP, the Directors are given discretion to determine the ratio 
of partnership shares to matching shares. The ratio is currently 1:1. 
During the year 381,284 partnership and 381,284 matching shares were 
allocated in aggregate to eligible employees under the SIP. Free shares 
may be distributed to eligible employees with a maximum market value 
of  3,000 per employee per year. For the year ended 31 December 
2008, no awards of free shares were made.
Long term incentive plan
The Long Term Incentive Plan was introduced in May 2007 (the 2007 
LTIP ). Under the 2007 LTIP, selected individuals may receive a conditional 
right to receive shares, which cliff vest after three years and are subject 
to continued employment. Shares issued to senior management under 
the 2007 LTIP are subject to the achievement of stretching performance 
conditions. The performance conditions applying to the shares subject 
to an award will be determined by the remuneration committee prior 
to any awards being made and will be a mix of challenging share price 
growth targets and profitability targets.
The committee believes that the 2007 LTIP represents a sensible 
long-term incentive arrangement which is not excessive, is cost effective 
for the Company taking account of both share usage and the new 
accounting treatment of share schemes and will mean that a significant 
but not excessive proportion of the Executive's remuneration will be 
linked to a requirement to generate superior returns to shareholders. 
During 2008, the rights over 719,000 shares were awarded under this 
plan (2007: 4.4 million shares).
Executive Directors' Service Contracts
All Executive Directors' service contracts are rolling contracts, terminable 
by either party on not less than 12 months' written notice. In the event 
of a material breach of contract or gross misconduct by the Executive 
Director, the Company may terminate the employment by written notice 
having immediate effect.

Asterand plc - Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
The graph above shows the Company's share price performance compared with the performance of the UK techMark Mediscience Index. The performance 
of the Group is presented since January 2006, the date that Asterand Inc. and Pharmagene plc merged to form Asterand plc because the enlarged 
Group is considered to be substantially different and not comparable to Pharmagene plc as a standalone entity prior to 2006. The remuneration 
committee believes the UK techMark Mediscience Index to be the most appropriate index against which Asterand should be measured.
