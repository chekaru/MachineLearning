Directors' Remuneration Report
Unaudited information
For the year ended 31 December 2009
Remuneration committee
In 2009, the remuneration committee was chaired by Peter Coggins and included 
Ian Ratcliffe and Jack Davis. The remuneration committee has the responsibility for 
determining the Group's overall policy on executive remuneration and for deciding 
the specific remuneration, benefits and terms of employment for Executive Directors. 
The remuneration committee also has regard to remuneration packages for senior 
executives who are not Board Directors, but have a significant influence over the 
Group's ability to meet its strategic objectives. Fees paid to the Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole and no Director is 
responsible for approving his or her own remuneration. The remuneration committee, 
in its deliberations on the remuneration policy for the Company's Directors, seeks 
to give full consideration to the Combined Code, including the provisions set out in 
Schedule A to the Code. The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the remuneration 
committee. The remuneration committee performs a benchmarking exercise in 
determining compensation prior to the appointment of any Executive Director.
Policy on Directors' remuneration
This section of the remuneration report covers the policies set by the remuneration 
committee. Detailed disclosure of Directors' remuneration for the year ended 
31 December 2009 together with disclosure of share ownership and entitlement to 
share options is set out on pages 18 to 20.
The policies set by the remuneration committee are intended to attract and retain 
high calibre executives, to motivate them to build a successful Company and seek to 
maximise shareholder value. Remuneration committee policies and procedures also 
aim to ensure that Executive Directors receive remuneration appropriate to their 
performance, experience, responsibility and geographic location without paying more 
than appropriate in the circumstances. 
The Group operates in a dynamic business sector. The remuneration committee's 
policies aim to align business strategy and corporate objectives with executive 
remuneration. Certain policies may need to be adjusted from time to time in order 
to ensure appropriate mix between performance-based and non performance-based 
elements and between long and short-term goals and rewards, depending upon the 
challenges facing the business and its objectives at any given point in its development.
Where major changes in remuneration policy may be required, the remuneration 
committee would expect to discuss these with key shareholders in advance. 
Executive Directors' remuneration packages are comprised of a basic annual 
salary, a performance related bonus and other customary benefits such as pension 
contributions and health insurance together with long-term incentive arrangements 
in the form of share options and share incentive plans. The Board believes that 
incentives such as share options and the share incentive plans serve as a valuable 
role in motivating Executive Directors and employees to act in the interests of creating 
shareholder value.
Basic salary
The basic salary of each Executive Director is determined by the remuneration 
committee taking into account individual performance and aims to ensure that 
remuneration remains competitive with similar companies in terms of size and 
complexity. Basic salary levels for Executive Directors are designed to be at least at 
the median level reflecting the levels of performance, experience and responsibility 
held by each of the Executive Directors.
Performance bonus
Each Executive Director is eligible for a discretionary annual bonus in recognition 
of that Director's contribution to the success of the Group and the achievement 
of specified performance targets. These performance targets include a combination 
of corporate and individual objectives except for the Chief Executive Officer whose 
bonus is based entirely on the achievement of corporate objectives.
The targeted composition of each Executive Director's remuneration excluding share 
options and shares acquired under the Performance Share Plan for those Directors 
who have served during the year is as follows:
 
Executive Directors for the year ending 31 December 2009
 
Basic salary, retirement 
and other benefits
 
Performance
 Bonus
  
M Coombs 70%
 
30%
J Stchur 70% 30%
The Group contributes a sum equal to a fixed proportion of basic salary to a 
defined contribution scheme on behalf of each Executive Director (and participating 
employees) each month. The Group funds the provision of private medical insurance 
for Executive Directors and their immediate family and funds permanent health 
insurance and life assurance cover for executives. Executive Directors are also 
provided with a mobile phone for business and personal use. Company cars are not 
provided to Directors or staff.
Share Options
Executive Director, Martyn Coombs, was granted an option in 2007 at the closing 
mid-market value of the Company's Ordinary Shares on the day of grant. The option 
has no performance criteria and vests, subject to continued employment, three years 
after grant.
Executive Director John Stchur was granted options in 2007 and 2009  at the 
closing mid-market value of the Company's ordinary shares on the day of the grant. 
Performance conditions attached to share options granted to John Stchur under the 
2007 LTIP are consistent with the policy set out on page 16.
Share Incentive Plan
The Company's intention is to encourage share ownership at all levels of the business, 
thereby aligning all employees' interests with those of the shareholders. Accordingly, 
the Company introduced the Pharmagene plc 2002 Inland Revenue Approved Share 
Incentive Plan (the SIP ) in 2003. All eligible employees may participate in the SIP  Asterand plc - Annual Report and Accounts 2009 16
 
which contains three elements: partnership shares, matching shares and free shares 
(known internally as Corporate Bonus Shares).
Partnership shares may be purchased by employees out of their pretax salary up to 
 1,500 (or 10% of salary if lower) per year. Where employees purchase partnership 
shares, they can be awarded additional matching shares at no additional cost to the 
employee. Under the rules of the SIP, the Directors are given discretion to determine 
the ratio of partnership shares to matching shares. The ratio is currently 1:1. 
During the year 342,998 partnership and 342,998 matching shares were allocated 
in aggregate to eligible employees under the SIP. Free shares may be distributed to 
eligible employees with a maximum market value of  3,000 per employee per year. 
For the year ended 31 December 2009, no awards of free shares were made.
Long Term Incentive Plan 
The Long Term Incentive Plan was introduced in May 2007 (the 2007 LTIP ). 
Under the 2007 LTIP, selected individuals may receive awards structured either as a 
conditional right to receive shares or as nil cost options. 
Awards granted in 2007 , 2008 and 2009 to Executive Directors are subject to EBITDA 
performance targets as are awards granted to senior management in 2007 . Other 
awards are subject to time-based vesting only. 
The Remuneration Committee believes the 2007 LTIP represents a sensible long-
term incentive arrangement which is not excessive, is cost effective for the Company 
taking into account both share usage and the new accounting treatment of share 
plans and will mean that a significant but not excessive proportion of the Executive's 
remuneration will be linked to a requirement to generate superior returns to 
shareholders. 
During 2009, the rights over 1,773,000 shares were awarded under this plan 
(2008: 719,000 shares). 
Executive Directors' Service Contracts
The Chief Executive Officer's service contract is a rolling contract, terminable on not 
less than 12 months' written notice. In the event of a material breach of contract 
or gross misconduct by the Executive Director, the Company may terminate the 
employment by written notice having immediate effect.

option or share incentive schemes.

Relative Performance (rebased to ATD)
The graph above shows the Company's share price performance compared with the performance of the UK techMark Mediscience Index. The performance of the Group is 
presented since January 2006, the date that Asterand Inc. and Pharmagene plc merged to form Asterand plc because the enlarged Group is considered to be substantially 
different and not comparable to Pharmagene plc only, as a standalone entity, prior to 2006. The remuneration committee believes the UK techMark Mediscience Index to be 
the most appropriate index against which Asterand should be measured. Asterand plc - Annual Report and Accounts 2009 18

For the year ended 31 December 2009, the Group contributed 12% (2008: 12%) of basic salary to a defined contribution pension scheme for the UK based 
Executive Director and 3.9% (2008: 3.9%) of basic salary to a define contribution scheme for the US based Executive Director. Benefits in kind include 
private medical insurance for Executive Directors and their immediate family, permanent health insurance and life assurance cover. Mr. Coombs and Mr. 
Stchur are recompensed in dollars, and therefore some of the difference in pound sterling in the comparison between years 2008 and 2009 arises from the 
changes in the dollar/sterling exchange rate. Asterand plc - Annual Report and Accounts 2009 20
