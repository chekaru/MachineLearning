 Asterand plc - Annual Report and Accounts 2010 15
Unaudited information
For the year ended 31 December 2010
Remuneration committee
In 2010, the remuneration committee was chaired by Peter Coggins and included,
Jack Davis and Ian Ratcliffe until his resignation on 8 June 2010, at which time
Jonathan Fleming joined the committee. The remuneration committee has the
responsibility for determining the Group's overall policy on executive remuneration
and for deciding the specific remuneration, benefits and terms of employment for
Executive Directors. The remuneration committee also has regard to remuneration
packages for senior executives who are not Board Directors, but have a significant
influence over the Group's ability to meet its strategic objectives. Fees paid to the
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole and
no Director is responsible for approving his or her own remuneration. The
remuneration committee, in its deliberations on the remuneration policy for the
Company's Directors, seeks to give full consideration to the Combined Code, including
the provisions set out in Schedule A to the Code. The Company Secretary acts as
secretary to the remuneration committee. The remuneration committee performs a
benchmarking exercise in determining compensation prior to the appointment of any
Executive Director.
Policy on Directors' remuneration
This section of the remuneration report covers the policies set by the remuneration
committee. Detailed disclosure of Directors' remuneration for the year ended 31
December 2010 together with disclosure of share ownership and entitlement to share
options is set out on pages 17 to 19.
The policies set by the remuneration committee are intended to attract and retain
high calibre executives, to motivate them to build a successful Company and seek to
maximise shareholder value. Remuneration committee policies and procedures also
aim to ensure that Executive Directors receive remuneration appropriate to their
performance, experience, responsibility and geographic location without paying more
than appropriate in the circumstances.
The Group operates in a dynamic business sector. The remuneration committee's
policies aim to align business strategy and corporate objectives with executive
remuneration. Certain policies may need to be adjusted from time to time in order to
ensure an appropriate mix between performance-based and non performance-based
elements and between long and short-term goals and rewards, depending upon the
challenges facing the business and its objectives at any given point in its development.
Where major changes in remuneration policy may be required, the remuneration
committee would expect to discuss these with key shareholders in advance. Executive
Directors' remuneration packages are comprised of a basic annual salary, a
performance related bonus and other customary benefits such as pension
contributions and health insurance together with long-term incentive arrangements in
the form of share options and share incentive plans. The Board believes that incentives
such as share options and the share incentive plans serve as a valuable role in
motivating Executive Directors and employees to act in the interests of creating
shareholder value.
Basic salary
The basic salary of each Executive Director is determined by the remuneration
committee taking into account individual performance and aims to ensure that
remuneration remains competitive with similar companies in terms of size and
complexity. Basic salary levels for Executive Directors are designed to be at least at
the median level reflecting the levels of performance, experience and responsibility
held by each of the Executive Directors.
Performance bonus
Each Executive Director is eligible for a discretionary annual bonus in recognition of
that Director's contribution to the success of the Group and the achievement of
specified performance targets. These performance targets include a combination of
corporate and individual objectives except for the Chief Executive Officer whose bonus
is based entirely on the achievement of corporate objectives.
The targeted composition of each Executive Director's remuneration excluding share
options and shares acquired under the Performance Share Plan for those Directors
who have served during the year is as follows:
Executive Directors for the year ended 31 December 2010
Basic salary, pension and Performance
other benefits bonus
M Coombs 70% 30%
J Stchur 70% 30%
The Group contributes a sum equal to a fixed proportion of basic salary to a defined
contribution scheme on behalf of each Executive Director (and participating
employees) each month. The Group funds the provision of private medical insurance
for Executive Directors and their immediate family and funds permanent health
insurance and life assurance cover for executives. Executive Directors are also provided
with a mobile phone for business and personal use. Company cars are not provided
to Directors or staff.
Share Options
Executive Director, Martyn Coombs, was granted options in 2007 at the closing mid-
market value of the Company's Ordinary Shares on the day of grant. The options had
no performance criteria and vested, three years after grant. Mr. Coombs met the
criterion relating to continued performance. In 2010 Mr. Coombs was granted shares
under a subscription to the Company's  Growth Share Option Plan' (GSOP) which was
approved by the shareholders on 8 June 2010. The GSOP is designed to exactly
reproduce the economic effects of ordinary share options in a tax efficient manner
through the use of shares in subsidiary entities that are convertible into shares of the
Group if certain conditions are met. Shares granted under the GSOP have no
performance criteria and a 3 year cliff vesting. This block of shares was issued in
order to continue to positively associate the performance (and resulting remuneration)
of the Executive to that of the Group.
Executive Director John Stchur was granted nil cost options in 2007 , 2009 and 2010.
Performance conditions attached to share options granted to John Stchur under the
2007 LTIP are consistent with the policy set out on page 16.

Share Incentive Plan
The Company's intention is to encourage share ownership at all levels of the business,
thereby aligning all employees' interests with those of the shareholders. Accordingly,
the Company introduced the Pharmagene plc 2002 Inland Revenue Approved Share
Incentive Plan (the SIP ) in 2003. All eligible employees may participate in the SIP
which contains three elements: partnership shares, matching shares and free shares
(known internally as Corporate Bonus Shares).
Partnership shares may be purchased by employees out of their pre-tax salary up to
 1,500 (or 10% of salary if lower) per year. Where employees purchase partnership
shares, they can be awarded additional matching shares at no additional cost to the
employee. Under the rules of the SIP, the Directors are given discretion to determine
the ratio of partnership shares to matching shares. The ratio is currently 1:1. During
the year 128,114 partnership and 128,114 matching shares were allocated in
aggregate to eligible employees under the SIP. Free shares may be distributed to
eligible employees with a maximum market value of  3,000 per employee per year.
For the year ended 31 December 2010, no awards of free shares were made.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Long Term Incentive Plan was introduced in May 2007 (the 2007 LTIP ). Under
the 2007 LTIP, selected individuals may receive awards structured either as a
conditional right to receive shares or as nil cost options.
Awards granted in 2007 and 2009 to Executive Directors are subject to EBITDA
performance targets as are awards granted to senior management in 2007 . Other
awards are subject to time-based vesting only.
The Remuneration Committee believes the 2007 LTIP represents a sensible long  term
incentive arrangement which is not excessive, is cost effective for the Company taking
into account both share usage and the accounting treatment of share plans and will
mean that a significant but not excessive proportion of the Executive's remuneration
will be linked to a requirement to generate superior returns to shareholders.
During 2010, the rights over 2,516,500 shares were awarded under this plan (2009:
1,773,000 shares). There were no performance conditions attached.
Executive Directors' service contracts
The Chief Executive Officer's service contract is a rolling contract, terminable on not
less than 12 months' written notice. In the event of a material breach of contract or
gross misconduct by the Executive Director, the Company may terminate the
employment by written notice having immediate effect.

Non-Executive Directors' letters of appointment
Non-Executive Directors have signed letters of appointment terminable on three months' written notice from either party. Non-Executive Directors receive fees for services as
members of the Board to reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of the role. None of the Company's Non-Executive Directors participate in the Group's current share
option or share incentive schemes.

The remuneration committee believes the UK techMark Mediscience Index to be the most appropriate index against which Asterand should be measured because it is comprised
of emerging, early growth stage companies whose business is within or dependent on the pharmaceutical, medical supplies, healthcare or biotechnology sectors.
