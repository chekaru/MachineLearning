Annual Report 2006
Report on the Directors' Remuneration
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with
Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 (the Act )
and meets the relevant requirements of the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority. In it, we
describe how the Board has applied the Principles
of Good Governance relating to directors'
remuneration. As required by the Act, a resolution
to approve the Report will be proposed at the
Annual General Meeting of the Company on 
29 September 2006.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the
Company's Shareholders on certain parts of the
Report and to state whether in their opinion those
parts of the Report have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Act. The Report has therefore
been divided into separate sections for unaudited
and audited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Messrs
A.J. Hales and D.M. Owen, both of whom are
independent non-executive directors. The
Committee's principal terms of reference include:
  To determine the remuneration of the
Executive Directors
  To agree performance thresholds and targets
  To determine amounts payable as annual
bonus
  To agree awards under the Company's
discretionary share option scheme.
The Committee establishes and maintains formal
and transparent procedures for developing policy on
executive remuneration and for fixing the
remuneration packages of individual directors, and
monitors and reports on them. It makes
recommendations to the Board. Neither of the
Committee members has any financial interest other
than as shareholders, conflicts of interests arising
from cross-directorships, or day-to-day involvement
in running the business. No director plays a part in
any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
In determining the directors' remuneration for the
year, the Committee compared directors'
remuneration packages with published surveys and
other available sources in respect of similar positions
in businesses of a similar size and complexity, and
specifically with the football industry sector.
Remuneration Policy
The Company's policy on executive remuneration is
to ensure that it has an appropriate mix of fixed
and variable pay over the short and long term to
retain and motivate executives with an appropriate
blend of skills and experience. It aims to reward
executives in line with the median of a comparative
group of selected companies in the football and
leisure sector. The Committee believes this will
enable the Company to retain and motivate
executives of high quality, contributing to the
delivery of long-term shareholder value. As a
consequence, the Company's focus is on the
following elements of the remuneration package:
  Basic pay to remain competitive in the current
market.
  Annual bonus payment to provide short-term
remuneration which reflects Company and
individual performance.
  Pension arrangements to enable directors to
make appropriate provisions for retirement.
  Share options to directly align executive
remuneration and shareholders' interest.
i. Basic Salary
Basic salary for each director is determined by the
Remuneration Committee, taking into account
performance of the individual and the Company,
together with experience and responsibilities. The
published surveys, which reported on market
practice within comparable sized companies both
in the football sector and the wider leisure sector,
established that basic salaries were broadly in line
with the mid point of comparator groups.
ii. Annual Bonus
The annual bonus is awarded at the discretion of
the Remuneration Committee payable biannually. 
It is designed to reward executives for their efforts
in preceding months, taking into account individual
performances, Company performance against
budget, performance in the FA Premier League
table and other competitions and the need to
achieve positive shareholder returns. The
Committee has regard to salary levels in
determining the proportion of total emoluments
represented by bonuses.
A maximum of 50% of annual salary may be
awarded as bonus against targets that include
league and cup performance, profit before tax and
individual personal targets. 17

iii. Pensions and Other Benefits
Executive directors, excluding Mr H.D. Ellis OBE,
are provided with a defined contribution pension
scheme. Pensionable earnings exclude annual
bonus and benefits. Executive directors are
provided with a company car or car allowance and
the provision of long-term ill health benefits may
also be provided.
iv. Share Options
The Company believes that share ownership
strengthens the link between personal interests
and those of Shareholders and encourages long-
term improvement in the Company's performance.
The exercise of options is subject to review by the
Remuneration Committee.
The Committee has resolved that in order to ensure
that directors only benefit where Shareholders
have received improved returns, when options are
granted under the scheme they will not normally
be exercisable until the Company's earning per
share meet a set condition.
The condition applicable to options granted
prior to 31 May 2004 is that during a period of
three consecutive financial years, the first
being no earlier than the year during which an
option is granted, the growth in the earnings
per share shall be at least six per cent higher
than the increase in the Retail Prices Index for
that period.
The condition applicable to options granted
after 31 May 2004 is that during a period of
three consecutive financial years, the first
being no earlier than the year during which an
option is granted, average total return per
share of the Company must exceed the
average total return per share of the FTSE
Small Cap Index Median Company averaged
over the same period.
In both cases, the exercise condition will not apply
if the occasion of the exercise of an option is the
death of the option holder, the cessation under
some circumstances of employment with the Group
or a takeover of the Company.
No new options have been granted since
September 2004, being the first granted since
August 2001.
Non-Executive Directors
The fees paid to non-executive directors are
reviewed annually by the Executive Board after
taking into account comparisons with similar sized
companies and the time spent in performing their
duties as non-executive directors. They do not
participate in annual bonus, pensions and other
benefits, and the grant of share options.
Service Contracts
The contracts of service for Mr H.D. Ellis OBE and
Mr S.M. Stride are terminable by the Company on
twelve months' notice.
In the case of terminations, the directors would
meet their contractual obligations whilst seeking to
mitigate the Company's liability.
The non-executive directors Messrs A.J. Hales, 
D.M. Owen, P .D. Ellis, and S.A. Kind are engaged on
a fixed term until the date of the Annual General
Meeting 2007 subject to confirmation at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Performance Graph
The following graph shows the Company's total
shareholder return (TSR ) for the five years to 
31 May 2006 compared with the FTSE Small Cap,
this index having been chosen as it is the most
appropriate comparator group for the Company.
Executive Directors   Outside Appointments
The Company recognises the benefits to the
individual and to the Company of involvement by
executive directors of the Company as non-
executive directors in Companies outside the
Group. Subject to approval by the Board, and to
time restrictions, they are permitted to accept a
limited number of appointments as non-executive
director in other companies and to retain the fees
paid for such service.

Mr A.J. Hales waived  1,250 of his director's fees in the year.
Until 31 August 1999 pension payments made on behalf of S.M. Stride were in respect of a defined benefits
scheme where the Company contributed 10.4% and the employee contributed 5% of pensionable salary.
The scheme was to provide a pension of up to two-thirds of pensionable salary at normal retirement age
and subject to length of service. On 31 August 1999 the scheme was closed and contributions were
transferred to a defined contribution scheme. Benefits accrued in the defined scheme are as shown below.

1. Accrued pension is the pension accrued at September 1999 (the date of closure of the Scheme) with
statutory revaluation to 31 May 2006.
2. Transfer values as at 31 May 2005 and 31 May 2006 have been calculated in accordance with Actuarial
Guidance Note 11 (GN11) issued by the actuarial profession.
3. The increase in accrued pension is the increase in accrued pension as a result of additional service
and salary increases in the financial year less statutory revaluation. As no further benefit has accrued
this is nil. The Scheme was closed on 31 August 1999 and contributions have been transferred to a
defined contribution scheme.
4. The change in transfer value is the difference between the transfer value as at 31 May 2006 compared
to that as at 31 May 2005, as the effect of fluctuation in the transfer value due to factors beyond the
control of the Company and directors, such as stock market movements, is zero. This is due to the
scheme having been closed on 31 August 1999 for contributions.
5. The accounting treatment in respect of this defined benefit scheme is detailed in note 23.
The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid to the individual director. Instead, they
represent a potential liability of the pension scheme. 19
