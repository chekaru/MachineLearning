Directors' Remuneration Report 
At the Annual General Meeting on 30 April
2003, a resolution will be proposed to
approve the Directors' Remuneration Report.
Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration
Committee are Sir Peter Bonfield (Chairman
of the Committee), John Buchanan and Erna
M ller . They are all Non-Executive Directors.
Sir Peter became Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee in April 2002 in
succession to Lars Ramqvist following Dr
Ramqvist' s retirement from the Board. Dr
Buchanan became a member of the
Remuneration Committee following his
election as a Non-Executive Director at the
Annual General Meeting in April 2002.
The remit of the Remuneration Committee is,
primarily , to recommend for decision by the
Board the fundamental remuneration policy
for the Company and to ensure the proper
operation of all plans for employees involving
the Company' s shares. More particularly , it
makes specific proposals in respect of the
remuneration packages of individual
Executive Directors and the Company' s most
senior executives.
The Remuneration Committee met six times
during 2002. At its request, Peter Brown,
Vice-President, Global Compensation and
Benefits, attended a number of the meetings
and provided advice and services which
materially assisted the Remuneration
Committee during 2002. In doing so, Mr
Brown drew on various sources of data
concerning directors' and executives'
salaries, bonus levels and other incentives
including general pharmaceutical industry
reports and surveys, as well as surveys
specifically carried out for the Company .
These included certain surveys prepared for
the Company by T owers Perrin. During 2002,
T owers Perrin also provided consultancy and
share plan administration services to the
Company.
Overall Remuneration Policy and Purpose
The Company is committed to maintaining
a dynamic performance culture in which 
every employee champions the growth of
shareholder value, is clear about the Company' s
objectives, knows how their work impacts 
on those objectives and that they will benefit
from achieving high levels of performance.
The Board has confirmed that the Company's
overall remuneration policy and purpose is:
> to attract and retain people of the quality
necessary to sustain the Company as
one of the best pharmaceutical
companies in the world; and
> to motivate them to achieve the level of
performance necessary to create
sustained growth in shareholder value.
In order to achieve this, remuneration policy
and practice is designed:
> to closely align individual and team
reward with business performance at
each level;
> to encourage employees to perform to
their fullest capacity;
> to encourage employees to align their
interests with those of shareholders;
> to support managers' responsibility to
achieve business performance through
people and for them to recognise
superior performance, in the short and
longer term;
> to be as locally focused and flexible as is
practicable and beneficial;
> to be competitive and cost-effective in
each of the relevant employment
markets; and
> to be as internally consistent as is
practicable and beneficial taking due
account of market need.
The cost and value of the components of the
remuneration package are considered as a
whole and are designed:
> to ensure a proper balance of fixed and
variable performance related
components, linked to short and longer
term objectives; and
> to reflect market competitiveness taking
account of the total value of all of the
benefit components.
The benefit components contained in the
total remuneration package are:
> annual salary - based on conditions in the
relevant geographic market, with the
provision to recognise, in addition, the
value of individuals' sustained personal
performance, resulting from their ability
and experience;
> ad hoc rewards - special payments and
other measures available to reward
individuals (other than Executive
Directors) and teams following a particular
and outstanding business contribution;
> short term bonus - a lump sum payment
related to the targeted achievement of
identified business drivers and, where
appropriate, personal performance goals,
measured over a year within a specific
plan;
> share participation - various plans
provide the opportunity for employees to
take a personal stake in the Company's
wealth as shareholders; and
> other benefits such as holidays, sickness
benefit and pensions which are cost-
effective and compatible with the relevant
national welfare arrangements.
The way in which these elements are
combined and applied varies depending, for
example, on market need and practice in
various countries.
For Executive Directors, the individual
components are:
> annual salary - the actual salary for each
of the Executive Directors is determined
on behalf of the Board by the
Remuneration Committee; these salaries
reflect the experience and sustained
performance of the individuals to whom
they apply , as judged annually by the
Remuneration Committee, taking
account also of market competitiveness;
> short term bonus - the Deputy Chairman
and the Chief Executive are entitled to
bonuses related solely to the
achievement of the targeted performance
of earnings per share; other Executive
Directors are entitled to annual bonuses
related to the achievement of both the
targeted performance of earnings per
share and the achievement of functional
measures relevant to their particular area
of responsibility; the bonus payable for
Executive Directors is on a scale of 0-
100% of salary and 50% of salary is
payable for the achievement of target
business performance; 80% of the bonus
relates to the achievement of the earnings
per share target and 20% to the individual
measures;
> longer term bonus - Executive Directors
are also rewarded for improvement in the
share price performance of the Company
over a period of years by the grant of
share options; the grant of options under
the AstraZeneca Share Option Plan is
supervised by the Remuneration
Committee which also determines
whether any performance targets will
apply to the grant and/or exercise of
options; the exercise of options previously
granted under the Zeneca 1994
Executive Share Option Scheme is
currently subject to the performance
condition that before any exercise,
earnings per share must grow by at least 50

Directors' Remuneration Report
Directors' Remuneration Report continued
the increase in the UK retail prices index
plus 3% per annum over a continuous
three year period following grant; and
> pension arrangements - these are
described in more detail below.
Other customary benefits (such as a car and
health benefits) are also made available. In the
UK, this happens by way of the Executive
Directors' participation in the Company's
flexible benefits arrangements which apply to
the vast majority of the Company' s UK
employees. A similar programme was
introduced in Sweden in January 2003.
Executive Directors' Service Contracts
As stated in the Directors' Report, during
2002 the Company did not comply with
provision B.1.7 of the code of best practice in 
Part 2, Section 1 of the Combined Code
published by the Hampel Committee on
Corporate Governance and appended to the
Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority ,
relating to the notice period of Executive
Directors' service contracts.
During 2002, the service contracts provided
for a notice period of two years. However , in
January 2003, all the Executive Directors
agreed to reduce the notice periods of their
service contracts to one year . For new
Executive Directors, the Board would aim to
negotiate a one year notice period. In
exceptional circumstances, the initial notice
period may be for longer than one year . In
those circumstances, the Board would
explain to shareholders the reasons why it
believed a longer notice period was
necessary and it would be the Board's
intention that it should be reduced to one year
subsequently.
At the time of the Annual General Meeting 
on 30 April 2003, the unexpired term of
Executive Directors' service contracts will 
be a maximum of one year. The details of 
the Executive Directors' individual service
contracts are set out in the table below. In 
the event of the termination of an Executive
Director' s service contract, depending upon
the circumstances the Company may be
liable to provide compensation to the
Executive Director equivalent to the benefits
which he or she would have received during
the contractual notice period. The Company's
policy in the event of the termination of an
Executive Director' s service contract is to
avoid any liability to the Executive Director in
excess of his or her contractual entitlement
and aim to ensure that any liability is mitigated
to the fullest extent possible.
The Company announced in November 2002
that  ke Stavling, Executive Director , would
be leaving the Company at the end of January
2003. Mr Stavling will receive compensation
from the Company , to be paid on a monthly
basis, equivalent to two years base annual
salary.
Position of the Non-Executive Directors
None of the Non-Executive Directors has a
service contract. They are not eligible for
performance-related bonuses or the grant of
share options. No pension contributions are
made on their behalf.
AstraZeneca Share Option Plan
As stated above, the Remuneration
Committee determines the grant of options
under the AstraZeneca Share Option Plan
and ensures that, on every occasion before
the grant of any option, the performance of
the Company and the performance and
contribution of each participant is fully taken
into account when determining the number of
shares to be put under option and the
number of options to be granted. In respect of
the grants of options under the Plan in March
and August 2002, the Remuneration
Committee considered the fact that business
targets had been met in 2001, Nexium sales
continued to grow strongly , the Respiratory ,
Central Nervous System and Oncology
product portfolios continued to grow strongly ,
key products were progressing well through
late stage development and the R&D pipeline
remained strong and concluded a grant of
options was justified. The Remuneration
Committee also received assurances from
each member of the Senior Executive T eam
that the participants for whom they were
recommending a grant of options had
achieved the appropriate level of
performance.
In respect of the grants of options under the
Plan in March 2002 to each individual
Executive Director, the Remuneration
Committee considered the performance
factors described above and also received an
appraisal from the Chief Executive in respect
of the performance of each Executive
Director . In each case, the Remuneration
Committee concluded a grant of options was
justified.
Although the Company does not use total
shareholder return (TSR) as a measure of
performance for its share plans, a graph is set
out on page 53 illustrating the Company's
TSR performance over the last five years
against the FTSE 100 index.
External Appointments
With the specific approval of the Board in
each case, Executive Directors may accept
external appointments as non-executive
directors of other companies and retain any
related fees paid to them.

Accrued pension payable between the age of 60 and 65. Once 65 the pension payable is reduced by 2/7ths (or 28.6%) from the figures shown.

Pensions are payable to Directors in either Swedish kronor or pounds sterling. For ease of understanding, the above table has been presented
using the exchange rates for 2002 set out on page 51.
UK Executive Directors' Pension Arrangements
Sir T om McKillop is a member of the Company' s main UK defined benefit pension plan. The normal pension age under this plan is 62. However , a
member' s accrued pension is available from age 60 without any actuarial reduction. In addition the accrued pension is available, unreduced,
from age 57 if the Company consents to a request for early retirement and from age 50 if the retirement is at the Company' s request.
On death in retirement, the accrued pension shown is guaranteed payable for the first five years of retirement and then reduces to two-thirds of
this amount should there be a surviving spouse or other dependant. Any member may choose higher or lower levels of survivor' s pensions at
retirement, subject to Inland Revenue limits, in return for an adjustment to their own pension of equivalent actuarial value. Pensions are also
payable to dependent children. In the event of a senior employee becoming incapacitated from performing his work then a pension is payable
immediately as if such person had reached normal retirement age (subject to a maximum of 10 years additional service), based on current
pensionable salary . In the event of death prior to retirement, dependants are entitled to a pension of two-thirds of the pension that would have
been earned had such person remained in service to age 62 plus a capital sum of four times pensionable pay . Pensions in payment are increased
annually in line with inflation, as measured by the retail prices index, up to a maximum of 5%.
In respect of UK Executive Directors whose pensionable earnings are capped by the earnings limit imposed by the Finance Act 1989,
unapproved defined contribution schemes are made available. Currently , only Jonathan Symonds is affected by this limit. The Company has
agreed to pay annually 50% of base salary in excess of the statutory earnings cap for the pension and associated tax liability , with the intention of
providing equivalence of benefits with non-capped UK Directors. If this does not provide equivalence, the Company has agreed to make up the
difference. The benefits derived from equivalence are shown above as if the scheme was a defined benefit arrangement. The Company
contribution in 2002 in respect of the pension element was $171,000.
Swedish Executive Directors' Pension Arrangements
Normally , Swedish Executive Directors participate in the collectively bargained ITP pension plan, which provides pensions, dependants'
pensions and lump sums on death in service. In respect of those Swedish Directors or former Directors, namely H kan Mogren,  ke Stavling and
Claes Wilhelmsson, whose pensionable earnings are or were in excess of the earnings limit imposed by the Swedish Communal T ax Law
(Kommunalskattelagen), supplementary pension commitments are made. The Company has agreed to pay 70% of pensionable salary from age
60 to age 65 and 50% of such earnings from age 65. The ITP provisions are included in this additional commitment. Paid in pension capital may
also be used in the event of retirement or termination before the age of 60. In the event of long term illness then a pension is payable immediately
as if such person had reached the normal retirement age, of 70% of current pensionable salary . On death in retirement the accrued pension
shown is payable to a surviving spouse or other dependant. In the event of death prior to retirement the accrued pension shown is payable to a
surviving spouse or other dependant plus a capital sum of three times pensionable salary less $100,000 if married or two times pensionable
salary less $100,000 if not. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F 2002

Graph Showing T otal Shareholder Return
The UK Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the inclusion in the Directors' Remuneration Report of a graph showing total
shareholder return (TSR) over a five year period in respect of a holding of the Company' s shares, plotted against TSR in respect of a hypothetical
holding of shares of a similar kind and number by reference to which a broad equity market index is calculated. This illustrates the Company's
TSR performance against the broad equity market index selected and is required even though the Company does not use TSR as a measure of
performance for its share plans. For the purposes of this graph, set out below, we have selected the FTSE 100 Index as the appropriate index.
Directors' Interests in Shares
The interests at 31 December 2002 or on date of retirement of the persons who on that date were Directors (including the interests of their
families) in shares and debentures of AstraZeneca PLC are shown below, all of which were beneficial except as otherwise stated. None of the
