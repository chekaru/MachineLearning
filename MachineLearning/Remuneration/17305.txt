Directors' Remuneration Report
Directors' Remuneration Report
At the Annual General Meeting on 29 April
2004, a resolution will be proposed to
approve the Directors' Remuneration
Report.
Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration
Committee are Sir Peter Bonfield (Chairman
of the Committee), John Buchanan and
Erna M ller. They are all Non-Executive
Directors. The Board considers them all to
be independent. 
The remit of the Remuneration Committee
is, primarily, to recommend for decision by
the Board the fundamental remuneration
policy for the Company and to ensure the
proper operation of all plans for employees
involving the Company' s shares. More
particularly, it makes specific proposals in
respect of the remuneration packages of
individual Executive Directors and the
Company' s most senior executives. A copy
of the Remuneration Committee's remit is
available on the Company's website:
astrazeneca.com.
The Remuneration Committee met four
times during 2003. Each meeting was
attended by all three of its members. At the
invitation of the Remuneration Committee,
the Chairman of the Board, a Non-
Executive Director, attended all of its
meetings in 2003. At the request of the
Remuneration Committee, Sir T om
McKillop, Chief Executive and Peter Brown,
Vice-President, Global Compensation and
Benefits, as well as the Secretary of the
Remuneration Committee, Graeme Musker,
attended all of its meetings and provided
advice and services which materially
assisted the Remuneration Committee
during 2003. In doing so, Mr Brown drew on
various sources of data concerning
directors' and executives' salaries, bonus
levels and other incentives including general
pharmaceutical industry reports and
surveys, as well as surveys specifically
carried out for the Company. These
included certain surveys prepared for the
Company by T owers Perrin. During 2003,
T owers Perrin also provided global share
plan administration services to the
Company and consultancy services to the
Company's US business.
Overall remuneration policy and 
purpose
The Company is committed to maintaining
a dynamic performance culture in which
every employee champions the growth of
shareholder value, is clear about the
Company' s objectives, knows how their
work impacts on those objectives and that
they will benefit from achieving high levels of
performance.
The Board has confirmed that the
Company' s overall remuneration policy and
purpose is:
> to attract and retain people of the quality
necessary to sustain the Company as
one of the best pharmaceutical
companies in the world; and
> to motivate them to achieve the level of
performance necessary to create
sustained growth in shareholder value.
In order to achieve this, remuneration policy
and practice is designed:
> to closely align individual and team
reward with business performance at
each level;
> to encourage employees to perform to
their fullest capacity;
> to encourage employees to align their
interests with those of shareholders;
> to support managers' responsibility to
achieve business performance through
people and for them to recognise
superior performance, in the short and
longer term;
> to be as locally focused and flexible as is
practicable and beneficial;
> to be competitive and cost-effective in
each of the relevant employment
markets; and
> to be as internally consistent as is
practicable and beneficial taking due
account of market need.
The cost and value of the components of
the remuneration package are considered
as a whole and are designed:
> to ensure a proper balance of fixed and
variable performance-related
components, linked to short and longer
term objectives; and
> to reflect market competitiveness taking
account of the total value of all of the
benefit components.
The principal components contained in the
total remuneration package, for employees
as a whole, are:
> annual salary - based on conditions in
the relevant geographic market, with the
provision to recognise, in addition, the
independence of the external auditor
were not in any way impaired by either
the nature of the non-audit work
undertaken by the external auditor
during the year, the level of non-audit
fees charged for such work or any other
facts or circumstances; full details of the
audit and non-audit fees for the year are
disclosed in Note 33 to the Financial
Statements; and
> the impact of the US Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 on the Company and, in
particular, on the operation of the Audit
Committee and its relationship with the
external auditor; this included periodic
reviews of the Company' s state of
compliance with applicable provisions
of the Act.
At the scheduled meeting of the Audit
Committee held at the end of January 2004,
the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial
Officer presented to Audit Committee
members their conclusions following the
evaluation of the effectiveness of the
Company' s disclosure controls and
procedures required by Item 15(a) of Form
20-F . Based on their evaluation, the Chief
Executive and the Chief Financial Officer
concluded that the Company maintains an
effective system of disclosure controls and
procedures.
There was no change in the Company's
internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the period covered by this
Annual Report and Form 20-F Information
that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company's
internal control over financial reporting.

above, this is derived from the
budget set by the Board and takes
into account external expectations
of performance;
> the Deputy Chairman was also
eligible for this annual bonus related
solely to earnings per share for that
part of 2003 during which he served
as an Executive Director (1 January
2003 until 31 August 2003);
> the Chief Financial Officer is eligible
for an annual bonus related to the
achievement of both the targeted
performance of earnings per share
and the achievement of
performance measures relevant to
his particular area of responsibility;
the bonus payable is on a scale of 
0-100% of salary and 50% of salary
is payable for the achievement of
target business performance; 
80% of the bonus relates to the
achievement of the earnings per
share target and 20% to the other
performance measures;
> longer term incentive - Executive
Directors are also rewarded for
improvement in the share price
performance of the Company over a
period of years by the grant of share
options; the grant of options under the
AstraZeneca Share Option Plan is
determined by the Remuneration
Committee, as are the performance
targets that will apply and whether they
will apply to the grant and/or exercise of
options - this is described in more detail
below; and
> pension arrangements - the table on
page 56 gives details of the changes in
the value of the Executive Directors'
accrued pensions during 2003:
> UK Executive Directors' pension
arrangements - the Chief Executive
is a member of the Company' s main
UK defined benefit pension plan; the
normal pension age under this plan
is 62; however, a member's accrued
pension is available from age 60
without any actuarial reduction; in
addition the accrued pension is
available, unreduced, from age 57 if
the Company consents to a request
for early retirement and from age 50
if the retirement is at the Company's
request;
On death in retirement, the accrued
pension is guaranteed payable for
the first five years of retirement and
then reduces to two-thirds of this
amount should there be a surviving
spouse or other dependent; any
member may choose higher or
lower levels of survivor' s pensions at
retirement, subject to Inland
Revenue limits, in return for an
adjustment to their own pension of
equivalent actuarial value; pensions
are also payable to dependent
children; in the event of a senior
employee becoming incapacitated
from performing his work then a
pension is payable immediately as if
such person had reached normal
retirement age (subject to a
maximum of 10 years additional
service), based on current
pensionable salary; in the event of
death prior to retirement,
dependents are entitled to a
pension of two-thirds of the pension
that would have been earned had
such person remained in service to
age 62 plus a capital sum of four
times pensionable pay; pensions in
payment are increased annually in
line with inflation, as measured by
the UK Retail Prices Index, up to a
maximum of 5%;
In respect of UK Executive Directors
whose pensionable earnings are
capped by the earnings limit
imposed by the Finance Act 1989,
unapproved defined contribution
schemes are made available;
currently, only the Chief Financial
Officer is affected by this limit; the
Company has agreed to pay
annually 50% of base salary in
excess of the statutory earnings cap
for the pension and associated tax
liability, with the intention of
providing equivalence of benefits
with non-capped UK Executive
Directors; if this does not provide
equivalence, the Company has
agreed to make up the difference;
the benefits derived from
equivalence are shown in the table
on page 56 as if the scheme was a
defined benefit arrangement; the
Company contribution in 2003 in
respect of the pension element was
$193,000;
value of individuals' sustained personal
performance, resulting from their ability
and experience;
> annual bonus - a lump sum payment
related to the targeted achievement of
corporate, functional and individual
goals, measured over a year within a
specific plan; the corporate goals are
derived from the annual budget set by
the Board and take into account
external expectations of performance;
the functional goals are agreed by the
Remuneration Committee at the start
of, and are monitored throughout, the
year;
> longer term incentive - for selected
groups, a longer term incentive targeted
at the achievement of strategic
objectives with close alignment to the
interests of shareholders;
> pension arrangements which are
appropriate to the relevant market;
> other benefits such as holidays and
sickness benefit which are cost-
effective and compatible with the
relevant national welfare arrangements;
and
> share participation - various plans
provide the opportunity for employees
to take a personal stake in the
Company' s wealth as shareholders.
The way in which these elements are
combined and applied varies depending, for
example, on market need and practice in
various countries.
For each Executive Director, the individual
components are:
> annual salary - the actual salary for each
of the Executive Directors is determined
by the Remuneration Committee on
behalf of the Board; these salaries
reflect the experience and sustained
performance of the individuals to whom
they apply, as judged annually by the
Remuneration Committee, taking
account also of market
competitiveness;
> short term bonus:
> the Chief Executive is eligible for an
annual bonus related solely to the
achievement of the targeted
performance of earnings per share;
the bonus payable is on a scale of 
0-100% of salary and 50% of salary
is payable for the achievement of
target performance; as referred to 52
AstraZeneca Annual Report and 
Form 20-F Information 2003
Directors' Remuneration Report
Directors' Remuneration Report continued
In respect of bonuses in 2003, relevant
factors considered included the delivery of
higher earnings per share than had been
anticipated both by the Board and
externally at the start of the year, the sales
performance of newer products, new
product approvals and emerging benefits
from  efficiency and effectiveness' projects.
Going forward, the corporate goals will
reflect the Company's statement that
financial performance over the next several
years is likely to rank among the best in the
global peer group of large capitalisation
pharmaceutical companies.
AstraZeneca Share Option Plan
The AstraZeneca Share Option Plan was
approved at the AGM in 2000 following prior
consultation with major shareholders. Its
design took account of the overall
competitiveness of the Company's
remuneration arrangements for senior
executives and US employees in the
context of the Company' s peers in the
pharmaceutical industry.
The Remuneration Committee must on
every occasion, before agreeing the grant of
options to Executive Directors and others,
be satisfied that the most recent and also
the underlying performance of the Company
justifies the grant; in addition it must be
satisfied that the necessary performance
has been achieved by each individual.
In agreeing grants of options in 2003, the
Remuneration Committee took into
account, in particular, very successful
progress in the previous year in the
transformation of the Company' s product
portfolio in view of the potential reduction in
sales resulting from the loss of patent
protection for key products. Against a
background of increased regulatory
demands and costs, the Company had set
clear strategic targets to be achieved in the
reference period: to increase sales of new
and growth products; to extend the
application of existing products; to launch
new products and to achieve key
milestones in making further new products
ready for launch. These targets were
achieved. For example: Nexium, launched
in 2001, achieved sales of close to $2 billion
in 2002 and Seroquel reached sales of over
$1 billion for the first time; new indications or
formulations for Arimidex, Casodex and
Zomig were launched in 2002; Iressa and
Faslodex were launched and key
milestones were passed in respect of
Crestor and Exanta.
The dilutive effect of the proposed grants of
options on the Company' s issued share
capital was also considered by the
Remuneration Committee, particularly in the
light of the letter sent to shareholders in
2000 by the then Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee ahead of the
approval of the plan at the AGM in which it
was stated that the percentage of the
issued share capital which could be
allocated under all of the Company's
employee share plans over a period of ten
years should be under 10%; this
commitment is applied by the
Remuneration Committee in practice as a
limit, on average, of under 1% per annum.
The Remuneration Committee concluded
that a grant of options to those plan
participants and individual Executive
Directors proposed for a grant was
appropriate given the level of performance
achieved.
Since the Company' s AGM in 2003, a
number of the Company' s larger
shareholders (particularly those who
expressed concern in respect of the
Directors' Remuneration Report for 2002)
have been consulted about the Company's
remuneration arrangements for its
Executive Directors and senior employees,
including the Company' s use of employee
share plans. While there are no apparent
concerns on the overall levels of
remuneration, concern has been expressed
about the fact that the AstraZeneca Share
Option Plan currently involves the
consideration of performance criteria on
grant, as described above, rather than the
fulfilment of performance conditions before
options can be exercised. The dialogue with
shareholders will continue. In particular, in
accordance with the arrangements agreed
with shareholders in 2000, the
Remuneration Committee intends to review
the AstraZeneca Share Option Plan during
2004.
A graph is set out on page 57 illustrating the
Company' s total shareholder return (TSR)
over the last five years against the FTSE 100
Index. Although the Company does not use
TSR as a formal measure of performance
for its share plans, it is an important
measure used in the Company' s overall
business performance assessment
process.
> Swedish Executive Directors'
pension arrangements - normally,
Swedish Executive Directors
participate in the collectively
bargained ITP pension plan, which
provides pensions, dependents'
pensions and lump sums on death
in service; in respect of those
Swedish Directors or former
Directors, namely H kan Mogren
and  ke Stavling, whose
pensionable earnings are or were in
excess of the earnings limit imposed
by the Swedish Communal T ax Law
(Kommunalskattelagen),
supplementary pension
commitments are made; the
Company has agreed to pay 70% of
pensionable salary from age 60 to
age 65 and 50% of such earnings
from age 65; the ITP provisions are
included in this additional
commitment; paid in pension capital
may also be used in the event of
retirement or termination before the
age of 60; in the event of long term
illness then a pension is payable
immediately as if such person had
reached the normal retirement age,
of 70% of current pensionable
salary; on death in retirement the
accrued pension is payable to a
surviving spouse or other
dependent; in the event of death
prior to retirement the accrued
pension is payable to a surviving
spouse or other dependent plus a
capital sum of three times
pensionable salary less $100,000 if
married or two times pensionable
salary less $100,000 if not.
Other customary benefits (such as a car and
health benefits) are also made available.
This happens by way of the Executive
Directors' participation in the Company's
flexible benefits arrangements,  which apply
to the vast majority of the Company' s UK
and Swedish employees. 
Measurement of performance
Each year, as referred to above both short
term and longer term objectives are agreed
with the Board and regularly monitored in
respect of both individual business
functions and integrated corporate strategy.
Performance against these objectives
determines functional bonuses and,
separately, whether or not share options will
be granted. AstraZeneca Annual Report and

the Company which is being paid on a
monthly basis from his leaving date until
the end of January 2005; the amount of
this compensation is equivalent to two
years' base annual salary; Mr Stavling
was entitled to a notice period of two
years under his service contract at the
time he left the Company.
> All other allowances, bonuses and
benefits ceased on Mr Stavling leaving
the Company at the end of January
2003.
> On leaving the Company, options held
by Mr Stavling over 80,516 Ordinary
Shares in the Company vested and
became exercisable; these options had
been granted to him since April 1999 at
various prices in the normal course of
operation of the Zeneca 1994 Executive
Share Option Scheme and the
AstraZeneca Share Option Plan; if not
exercised, they will lapse on 31 January
2005.
> In May 2003, there were released to Mr
Stavling from retention 7,624 Ordinary
Shares in the Company which he was
awarded in 2000 under the Zeneca
Executive Performance Bonus Scheme
in respect of his bonus for 1999.
> In November 2003, there were released
to Mr Stavling 533 Ordinary Shares in
the Company which were allocated to
him in November 2000 on the demerger
of Zeneca Agrochemicals in respect of
executive share options he held on 10
November 2000.
> Share options held by Mr Stavling under
the Astra Shareholder Value Incentive
Plan were not affected by his leaving the
Company and details are disclosed on
page 59 in the normal way.
> From age 60, the pension arrangements
previously disclosed by the Company in
respect of Mr Stavling will apply.
Executive Directors' service contracts
The service contracts of the current
Executive Directors provide for a notice
period of one year. For new Executive
Directors, the Board would aim to negotiate
a one year notice period. In exceptional
circumstances, the initial notice period may
be for longer than one year. In those
circumstances, the Board would explain to
shareholders the reasons why it believed a
longer notice period was necessary and it
would be the Board' s intention that it should
be reduced to one year subsequently. At 
the time of the AGM on 29 April 2004, the
unexpired term of Executive Directors'
service contracts will be a maximum of one
year. The details of the Executive Directors'
individual service contracts are set out in the
table below.
In the event of the termination of an
Executive Director' s service contract,
depending upon the circumstances the
Company may be liable to provide
compensation to the Executive Director
equivalent to the benefits which he or she
would have received during the contractual
notice period. For current Executive
Directors, it is the Company' s expectation
that any such liability would be calculated
on the basis of one year' s base salary, target
bonus and other benefits. The Company's
policy in the event of the termination of an
Executive Director' s service contract is to
avoid any liability to the Executive Director in
excess of his or her contractual entitlement
and aim to ensure that any liability is
mitigated to the fullest extent possible.
Leaving arrangements for  ke Stavling
 ke Stavling, Executive Director, left the
Company at the end of January 2003. 
Mr Stavling' s leaving arrangements were
considered and approved by the
Remuneration Committee, based on
existing contracts and practice. These are
summarised below.
> As disclosed in the Directors'
Remuneration Report for 2002, Mr

prices in the normal course of operation
of the Astra Shareholder Value Incentive
Plan, the Zeneca 1994 Executive Share
Option Scheme and the AstraZeneca

his change of status to Non-Executive
Deputy Chairman.
> The same applies to both the Ordinary
Shares in the Company which he was
awarded in 2000 under the Zeneca
Executive Performance Bonus Scheme
in respect of his bonus for 1999 and the
Ordinary Shares in the Company which
were allocated to him in November
2000 on the demerger of Zeneca
Agrochemicals in respect of executive
share options he held on 10 November
2000. These Ordinary Shares were
released to him in May and November
2003 respectively. More details about
share options and the releases of shares
are disclosed on pages 57 to 59.
As a Non-Executive Director, Dr Mogren will
not be entitled to any future performance
related bonuses, grants of share options 
or pension contributions. From age 60,
subject to his re-election as a Director at
AGMs, Dr Mogren' s fee as Non-Executive
Deputy Chairman will be  100,000 per
annum. From age 60, the pension
arrangements previously disclosed by the
Company in respect of Dr Mogren will apply.
During 2003, Dr Mogren purchased certain
furnishings from the Company on arm's
length terms. The total value of the
transaction concerned was SEK618,000.
The value of the items purchased was
assessed by independent valuers.
Position of the Non-Executive Directors
None of the Non-Executive Directors has a
service contract. They are not eligible for
performance-related bonuses or the grant
of share options. No pension contributions
are made on their behalf.
External appointments and retention of
fees
With the specific approval of the Board in
each case, Executive Directors may accept
external appointments as non-executive
directors of other companies and retain any
related fees paid to them.

Graph showing total shareholder return
The UK Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the inclusion in the Directors' Remuneration Report of a graph showing
total shareholder return (TSR) over a five year period in respect of a holding of the Company' s shares, plotted against TSR in respect of a
hypothetical holding of shares of a similar kind and number by reference to which a broad equity market index is calculated. This illustrates
the Company' s TSR performance against the broad equity market index selected. For the purposes of this graph, set out below, we have
selected the FTSE 100 Index as the appropriate index.
