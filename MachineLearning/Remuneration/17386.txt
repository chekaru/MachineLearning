These included certain surveys prepared 
for the Company by T owers Perrin. During
2004, T owers Perrin also provided global
share plan administration services to the
Company and consultancy services to the
Company' s US business.
In July 2004, Ms Carol Arrowsmith of
Deloitte & T ouche was appointed by the
Remuneration Committee to provide it with
independent advice on all matters being
considered by it. During 2004, Deloitte &
T ouche also provided taxation advice and
other non-audit services to the Company.
Overall remuneration policy and
purpose
The Company is committed to maintaining
a dynamic performance culture in which
every employee champions the growth 
of shareholder value, is clear about the
Company' s objectives, knows how their
work impacts on those objectives and that
they will benefit from achieving high levels 
of performance.
The Board has confirmed that the
Company' s overall remuneration policy 
and purpose is:
> To attract and retain people of the
quality necessary to sustain the
Company as one of the best
pharmaceutical companies in the world.
> To motivate them to achieve the level 
of performance necessary to create
sustained growth in shareholder value.
In order to achieve this, remuneration policy
and practice is designed:
> To closely align individual and team
reward with business performance 
at each level.
> To encourage employees to perform 
to their fullest capacity.
> To encourage employees to align their
interests with those of shareholders.
> To support managers' responsibility to
achieve business performance through
people and for them to recognise
superior performance, in the short 
and longer term.
> To be as locally focused and flexible 
as is practicable and beneficial.
> To be competitive and cost-effective 
in each of the relevant employment
markets.
> To be as internally consistent as is
practicable and beneficial taking due
account of market need.
The cost and value of the components of
the remuneration package are considered
as a whole and are designed:
> To ensure a proper balance of fixed 
and variable performance-related
components, linked to short and 
longer term objectives.
> To reflect market competitiveness
taking account of the total value 
of all of the benefit components.
Throughout 2004, the principal components
contained in the total remuneration
package, for employees as a whole, were:
> Annual salary - based on conditions 
in the relevant geographic market, with
the provision to recognise, in addition,
the value of individuals' sustained
personal performance, resulting from
their ability and experience.
> Annual bonus - a lump sum payment
related to the targeted achievement 
of corporate, functional and individual
goals, measured over a year and
contained within a specific plan. 
The corporate goals are derived from
the annual financial targets set by the 
Board and take into account external
expectations of performance. The
functional goals are agreed by the
Remuneration Committee at the start
of, and are monitored throughout, 
the year.
> Longer term incentive - for selected
groups, a longer term incentive targeted
at the achievement of strategic
objectives with close alignment to the
interests of shareholders.
> Pension arrangements which are
appropriate to the relevant national
market.
> Other benefits such as holidays and
sickness benefit which are cost-
effective and compatible with the
relevant national welfare arrangements.
> Share participation - various plans
provide the opportunity for employees
to take a personal stake in the
Company' s wealth creation as
shareholders.
The way in which these elements are
combined and applied varies depending, 
for example, on market need and practice 
in various countries.
In 2004, for each Executive Director, the
individual components were:
At the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 
28 April 2005, a resolution will be proposed
to approve the Directors' Remuneration
Report.
Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration
Committee are Sir Peter Bonfield (Chairman
of the Committee), John Buchanan, Erna
M ller and Joe Jimenez. Mr Jimenez was
appointed as a member of the
Remuneration Committee with effect from
the end of the AGM on 29 April 2004. They
are all Non-Executive Directors. The Board
considers them all to be independent. 
The remit of the Remuneration Committee
is, primarily, to recommend for decision by
the Board the fundamental remuneration
policy for the Company and to ensure the
proper operation of all plans for employees
involving the Company' s shares. More
particularly, it makes specific proposals 
in respect of the remuneration packages 
of individual Executive Directors and 
the Company' s most senior executives. 
A copy of the Remuneration Committee' s
remit is available on the Company' s
website: astrazeneca.com.
The Remuneration Committee met six times
during 2004. Each meeting was attended
by all of its members except that John
Buchanan was unable to attend the
September meeting and Joe Jimenez was
unable to attend the December meeting
due to other commitments. At the invitation
of the Remuneration Committee, the
Chairman of the Board, a Non-Executive
Director, attended all of its meetings in 2004
except for those held in September and
December.
At the request of the Remuneration
Committee, Sir T om McKillop, Chief
Executive, T ony Bloxham, Executive 
Vice-President, Human Resources and
Peter Brown, Vice-President, Global
Compensation and Benefits, as well as the
Secretary of the Remuneration Committee,
Graeme Musker , attended all of its meetings
in 2004, except when their own remuneration
was being discussed. They provided advice
and services which materially assisted the
Remuneration Committee during the year . In
doing so, Mr Brown drew on various sources
of data concerning directors' and executives'
salaries, bonus levels and other incentives
including general pharmaceutical industry
reports and surveys, as well as surveys
specifically carried out for the Company .

Directors' Remuneration Report

> Longer term incentive - Executive
Directors are also rewarded for
improvement in the share price
performance of the Company over 
a period of years by the grant of share
options. The grant of options under 
the AstraZeneca Share Option Plan 
is determined by the Remuneration
Committee, as are the performance
targets that will apply and whether they
will apply to the grant and/or exercise 
of options - this is described in more
detail below.
> Pension arrangements - the table on
page 66 gives details of the changes 
in the value of the Executive Directors'
accrued pensions during 2004:
> UK Executive Directors' pension
arrangements - the Chief Executive
is a member of the Company' s main
UK defined benefit pension plan.
The normal pension age under this
plan is 62. However, a member' s
accrued pension is available from
age 60 without any actuarial
reduction. In addition the accrued
pension is available, unreduced,
from age 57 if the Company
consents to a request for early
retirement and from age 50 if the
retirement is at the Company' s
request.
On death in retirement, the accrued
pension is guaranteed payable for
the first five years of retirement and
then reduces to two-thirds of this
amount should there be a surviving
spouse or other dependant. Any
member may choose higher or
lower levels of survivor' s pensions 
at retirement, subject to Inland
Revenue limits, in return for an
adjustment to their own pension of
equivalent actuarial value. Pensions
are also payable to dependant
children. In the event of a senior
employee becoming incapacitated,
then a pension is payable
immediately as if such person had
reached normal retirement age
(subject to a maximum of 10 years
additional service), based on current
pensionable salary. In the event 
of death prior to retirement,
dependants are entitled to a
pension of two-thirds of the pension
that would have been earned had
such person remained in service to
age 62 plus a capital sum of four
times pensionable pay. Pensions 
in payment are increased annually 
in line with inflation, as measured 
by the UK Retail Prices Index, up 
to a maximum of 5%.
In respect of UK Executive Directors
whose pensionable earnings are
capped by the earnings limit
imposed by the Finance Act 1989,
unapproved defined contribution
schemes are made available.
Currently, only the Chief Financial
Officer is affected by this limit. 
The Company has agreed to pay
annually 50% of base salary in
excess of the statutory earnings cap
for the pension and associated tax
liability, with the intention of
providing equivalence of benefits
with non-capped UK Executive
Directors. If this does not provide
equivalence, the Company has
agreed to make up the difference.
The benefits derived from
equivalence are shown in the table
on page 66 as if the scheme were
a defined benefit arrangement. 
The Company contribution in 2004
in respect of the pension element
was  124,000 ($225,000).
Other customary benefits (such as a car 
and health benefits) are also made available
through participation in the Company' s
flexible benefits arrangements, which
extend to the vast majority of the
Company' s UK and Swedish employees. 
Measurement of performance
Each year, as referred to above, both short
term and longer term objectives are agreed
with the Board and regularly monitored in
respect of both individual business functions
and integrated corporate strategy in the
business performance report. Performance
against these objectives determines
functional bonuses and, separately, whether
or not share options will be granted.
In respect of bonuses in 2004, relevant
factors included financial results ahead 
of expectations and excellent progress in
key areas. Earnings per share increased by
18%; global sales increased by 9% overall
and by 30% in key growth products (all at
constant exchange rates), with particularly
strong performance in emerging markets. 
In Research, all targets for new compounds
were exceeded; in Development, good
> Annual salary - the actual salary for
each of the Executive Directors is
determined by the Remuneration
Committee on behalf of the Board and
established in sterling. These salaries
reflect the experience and sustained
performance of the individuals to 
whom they apply, as judged annually 
by the Remuneration Committee, taking
account also of market competitiveness
and the level of increases applicable to
all other employees.
> Short term bonus:
> The Chief Executive was eligible for
an annual bonus related solely to 
the achievement of the targeted
performance of earnings per share.
The bonus payable was on a scale of
0-100% of salary and 50% of salary
was payable for the achievement of
target performance. This was derived
from the financial targets set by the
Board and took into account external
expectations of performance. The
bonus was not pensionable. In the
light of the disappointing setbacks
with Exanta and Iressa in 2004, the
Remuneration Committee and Sir
Tom McKillop agreed a reduction 
in his bonus. It was agreed that his
bonus for 2004 should be reduced 
to a sum equivalent to 50% of the
bonus he received in respect of
2003. This amounts to  430,000
($782,000). The Remuneration
Committee was also mindful in
setting the bonus for 2004 that 
all employees, including Sir T om
McKillop, who had an interest 
in shares throughout 2004, had
seen the value of their shares 
fall significantly during the year, in
common with other shareholders.
> The Chief Financial Officer was
eligible for an annual bonus related
to the achievement of both the
targeted performance of earnings
per share and the achievement of
performance measures relevant to
his particular area of responsibility.
The bonus payable was on a scale
of 0-100% of salary and 50% of
salary was payable for the
achievement of target business
performance. 80% of the bonus
related to the achievement of the
earnings per share target and 20%
to the other performance measures.
The bonus was not pensionable. 62

Directors' Remuneration Report
Directors' Remuneration Report continued
$519 million); good progress was made
with cost control initiatives and other
efficiency initiatives resulting in significant
savings in the area of purchasing and more
effective working practices and clinical
productivity in R&D. Further positive steps
were taken with regard to issues in the
areas of corporate responsibility,
governance and access to medicines.
The Remuneration Committee also sought
and received assurances that all individuals
proposed for a grant of options had been
confirmed as performing in a manner that
justified a grant to them. It was noted that
there was some variation in the level of
grants being proposed between individuals,
to reflect differing levels of performance.
The dilutive effect of the proposed grants 
of options on the Company' s issued share
capital was also considered by the
Remuneration Committee, in accordance
with the commitment, given that the
percentage of the issued share capital
which could be allocated under all of the
Company' s employee share plans over a
period of ten years should be under 10%;
this commitment is applied by the
Remuneration Committee in practice as a
limit, on average, of under 1% per annum.
The Remuneration Committee concluded
that a grant of options to those plan
participants and individual Executive
Directors proposed for a grant was
appropriate given the level of performance
achieved. For the grants of options in 2004
to members of the Senior Executive T eam,
the Remuneration Committee requested
that a condition be included to the effect
that if an event occurred which caused
material reputational damage to the
Company such that it was not appropriate
for the options to vest and become
exercisable, then the Remuneration
Committee could make a determination 
to that effect. 
Review of executive remuneration
In 2000, the Company volunteered a
commitment that a review of practice would
progress was made in the restructuring 
of the clinical and regulatory function; 
in Operations, there was excellent
performance in customer satisfaction,
supply chain management and financial
control. Bonus outcomes reflected the
variety of functional performance in the
context of overall business success and 
the disappointments in the year.
AstraZeneca Share Option Plan
The AstraZeneca Share Option Plan 
was approved at the AGM in 2000 following
prior consultation with major shareholders.
Its design took account of the overall
competitiveness of the Company' s
remuneration arrangements for senior
executives and US employees in the
context of the Company' s peers in the
pharmaceutical industry.
The Remuneration Committee must on
every occasion, before agreeing the grant 
of options to Executive Directors and
others, be satisfied that the most recent 
and also the underlying performance of 
the Company justifies the grant; in addition
it must be satisfied that the necessary
performance has been achieved by 
each individual.
In agreeing grants of options in 2004
(which occurred before the disappointing
events relating to Exanta and Iressa),
the Remuneration Committee took into
account, the fact that the Company, 
when compared with its peer group of
international pharmaceutical companies,
was ranked first in terms of both relative
share price and total shareholder return
over the three year period January 2001 
to January 2004; in 2003, the loss of $2.6
billion in sales to generic competition was
compensated for by strong growth in the
sales of newer products, with the sales of
those newer products representing 44% 
of total sales in 2003; strong sales growth
(at constant exchange rates) in 2003 for
Nexium (up 62% to $3.3 billion), Seroquel
(up 27% to $1.5 billion), Symbicort (up 61%
to $549 million) and Arimidex (up 46% to

take place in five years, taking account of
the view of the Company' s shareholders
and the needs of the business at that time.
This review took place during 2004.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed its
basic philosophy and confirmed that in
seeking to achieve sustained growth in
shareholder value it would demand the
highest level of performance from all
employees with the Company conducting
itself in a fair and moderate way, maintaining
the highest standards of social responsibility
and corporate governance. In order to
achieve this, it must attract and retain
Executive Directors and other senior
executives of the highest quality, competing
for them in the global employment market
and providing appropriate rewards directly
linked to top performance.
In the last five years, the Company has
honoured its promise regarding shareholder
dilution. Grants of options under the
AstraZeneca Share Option Plan worldwide
have amounted to 2.71% (plus 0.45%
under the old Zeneca 1994 Executive Share
Option Scheme). Dilution under other share
plans has been 0.36%.
During this time, the Company has
intensified its action to align reward directly
with performance. For example, the
business performance report has been
developed as described above. This
contains the short and long term strategic
objectives agreed annually with the Board
and cascaded down throughout the
Company; these are monitored quarterly
and determine both short term bonus and
long term awards. In addition, the reward 
of employees at all levels has become
increasingly differentiated based on their
individual performance.
In the review, the Remuneration Committee
confirmed that the reward package of
Executive Directors should be primarily
benchmarked against major UK based
companies with global operations similar 
to those of AstraZeneca, as opposed to AstraZeneca Annual Report and 
Form 20-F Information 2004
Directors' Remuneration Report
63
> A requirement for executives to hold
shares equivalent to one-times salary,
and to retain the net number of shares
acquired under the AstraZeneca Share
Option Plan for at least six months after
the option is exercised.
> Subject to a shareholder vote at the
AGM, the introduction of a new
performance share plan based on the
Company' s total shareholder return
relative to a global industry peer group.
This test would be underpinned by the
requirement of the Remuneration
Committee to satisfy itself that any total
shareholder return rewarded was a
genuine reflection of the Company' s
underlying performance and it would
explain its reasoning in the subsequent
Directors' Remuneration Report.
The Board and the Remuneration
Committee believe that bringing bonus 
and long term incentive opportunities 
closer to the market, subject to demanding
performance conditions, will appropriately
rebalance the proportion of reward so 
that variable performance-related pay is
dominant and will significantly improve 
the Company' s ability to attract and retain
executives of the quality necessary to lead
AstraZeneca in the future.
Executive Directors' service contracts
The service contracts of the current Executive
Directors provide for a notice period of one
year. For new Executive Directors, the Board
would aim to negotiate a one year notice
period. In exceptional circumstances, the
initial notice period may be for longer than
one year. In those circumstances, the Board
would explain to shareholders the reasons
why it believed a longer notice period was
necessary and it would be the Board' s
intention that it should be reduced to one
year subsequently. At the time of the AGM
on 28 April 2005, the unexpired term of
Executive Directors' service contracts will
be a maximum of one year. The details of
the Executive Directors' individual service
contracts are set out in the table on page 62.
In the event of the termination of an Executive
Director' s service contract, depending upon
the circumstances, the Company may be
liable to provide compensation to the
Executive Director equivalent to the benefits
which he or she would have received during 
the contractual notice period. For current
Executive Directors, it is the Company' s
expectation that any such liability would be
calculated on the basis of one year' s base
salary, target bonus and other benefits. 
The Company' s policy in the event of the
termination of an Executive Director' s
service contract is to avoid any liability to 
the Executive Director in excess of his or her
contractual entitlement and aim to ensure
that any liability is mitigated to the fullest
extent possible.
Arrangements for H kan Mogren and
 ke Stavling 
H kan Mogren, formerly Executive Deputy
Chairman, ceased to be an Executive
Director and employee of the Company and
became Non-Executive Deputy Chairman
at the end of August 2003. Dr Mogren' s
remuneration arrangements as a result of
this change were considered and approved
by the Remuneration Committee in 2003,
based on existing contracts and practice,
and were fully disclosed in the Directors'
Remuneration Report for 2003. Under
these arrangements, Dr Mogren received
compensation from the Company which
was paid on a monthly basis until the end 
of August 2004. The sum received by 
Dr Mogren in respect of this compensation
in 2004 is included in the disclosure of
Directors' emoluments on page 65.
 ke Stavling, formerly an Executive
Director, left the Company at the end 
of January 2003. Mr Stavling' s leaving
arrangements were considered and
approved by the Remuneration
Committee in 2002, based on existing
contracts and practice, and were fully
disclosed in the Directors' Remuneration
Report for 2003. Under these
arrangements, Mr Stavling is receiving
compensation from the Company which
is being paid on a monthly basis until the
end of January 2005. The amount of this
compensation is equivalent to two years'
base annual salary. Mr Stavling was
entitled to a notice period of two years
under his service contract at the time 
he left the Company. The sum received
by Mr Stavling in respect of this
compensation in 2004 is included in the
disclosure of Directors' emoluments on
page 65.
alignment with the global industry practice.
However, in appropriately balancing the
total package towards the delivery of award
for demonstrable performance, bonuses
and incentives should provide for upper
quartile opportunity for upper quartile
performance.
During 2004, the Remuneration Committee
sought the views of major shareholders. 
As it is five years since the last major review,
the Committee identified that the
competitive market place in major UK
companies had developed and shareholder
expectations had also changed. The
Remuneration Committee has taken the
views of shareholders into account in
formulating proposals which focus upon
performance-related pay and strengthened
the links to measures which are aligned to
the creation of shareholder value. These
proposals, primarily for the Senior Executive
T eam, are closely aligned to current best
practice and include: 
> An increase in the annual bonus
opportunity linked to a broader
assessment of performance together
with a requirement for the Senior
Executive T eam to defer a portion of
their bonus earned into shares for a
period of three years. As a result of the
most recent consultation, the basis of
determining the annual bonus for the
Senior Executive T eam will be changed.
In the past, the whole of the bonus of
the Chief Executive and 80% of those of
the others was determined by reference
to earnings per share. For 2005, 50%
will be determined by earnings per
share, 25% by measures relating to 
the individual' s particular area of
responsibility and 25% by a balance 
of qualitative and quantitative measures
which address the quality of business
performance. The Remuneration
Committee would reserve the right to
modify the bonus outcome if it believed
it did not reflect the underlying
performance of the business.
> The introduction of performance
conditions on exercise of options
granted under the AstraZeneca Share
Option Plan with no re-test facility, 
in order to bring our policy in line with 
best practice. 64

Graph showing total shareholder return
The UK Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the inclusion in the Directors' Remuneration Report of a graph showing
total shareholder return (TSR) over a five year period in respect of a holding of the Company' s shares, plotted against TSR in respect of a
hypothetical holding of shares of a similar kind and number by reference to which a broad equity market index is calculated. This illustrates
the Company' s TSR performance against the broad equity market index selected. The Company is a member of the FTSE 100 Index and
consequently, for the purposes of this graph which is set out below, we have selected the FTSE 100 Index as the appropriate index. 68
