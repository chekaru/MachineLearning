REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The members of the Remuneration Committee
are Sir Peter Bonfield (Chairman of the
Committee), John Buchanan, Erna M ller 
and Joe Jimenez. They are all Non-Executive
Directors. The Board considers them all to be
independent. (Independence of Non-Executive
Directors is discussed in more detail in the
Directors' Report on pages 63 and 64.)
The remit of the Remuneration Committee 
is, primarily, to recommend for decision by the
Board the fundamental remuneration policy 
for the Company and to ensure the proper
operation of all plans for employees involving
the Company' s shares. More particularly, 
it makes specific proposals in respect of the
remuneration packages of individual Executive
Directors and the Company' s most senior
executives. A copy of the Remuneration
Committee' s remit is available on the
Company' s website: astrazeneca.com.
The Remuneration Committee met four times
in 2005. Each meeting was attended by all of
its members, except that other commitments
prevented Erna M ller from attending the
meeting on 21 March and Joe Jimenez from
attending the meeting on 18 November.
At the request of the Remuneration Committee,
Sir T om McKillop (Chief Executive), T ony
Bloxham (Executive Vice-President, Human
Resources) and Peter Brown (Vice-President,
Global Compensation and Benefits) as well as
the Secretary of the Remuneration Committee,
Graeme Musker, attended all of its meetings in
2005, except when their own remuneration
was being discussed. They provided advice
and services that materially assisted the
Remuneration Committee during the year. 
In doing so, Mr Brown drew on various sources
of data concerning directors' and executives'
salaries, bonus levels and other incentives
including general pharmaceutical industry
reports and surveys, as well as surveys
specifically carried out for the Company. 
These included certain surveys prepared for
the Company by T owers Perrin. During 2005,
ExcellerateHRO (formed from the merger of
T owers Perrin and EDS) also provided global
share plan administration services to the
Company and consultancy services to the
Company' s US business.
During 2005, Ms Carol Arrowsmith of Deloitte
& T ouche was again appointed to provide the
Remuneration Committee with independent
advice on all matters being considered by it.
During 2005, Deloitte & T ouche also provided
taxation advice and other non-audit services
to the Company.
OVERALL REMUNERATION POLICY AND PURPOSE
The Company is committed to maintaining a
dynamic performance culture, in which every
employee champions the growth of shareholder
value, is clear about the Company' s objectives,
and knows how their work impacts on those
objectives and that they will benefit from
achieving high levels of performance.
The Board has confirmed that the Company' s
overall remuneration policy and purpose are to:
> Attract and retain people of the quality
necessary to sustain the Company as 
one of the best pharmaceutical companies
in the world.
> Motivate them to achieve the level 
of performance necessary to create
sustained growth in shareholder value.
In order to achieve this, remuneration policy
and practice are designed to:
> Closely align individual and team reward
with business performance at each level.
> Encourage employees to perform to their
fullest capacity.
> Encourage employees to align their
interests with those of shareholders.
> Support managers' responsibility to
achieve business performance through
people and to recognise superior
performance, in the short and longer term.
> Be as locally focused and flexible 
as is practicable and beneficial.
> Be as internally consistent as is practicable
and beneficial, taking due account 
of market need.
> Be competitive and cost-effective in each
of the relevant employment markets.
The cost and value of the components 
of the remuneration package are considered
as a whole and are designed to:
> Ensure a proper balance of fixed and
variable performance-related components,
linked to short and longer term objectives.
> Reflect market competitiveness, taking
account of the total value of all of the
benefit components.
PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS
OF EMPLOYEE REMUNERATION
Throughout 2005, the principal components
contained in the total remuneration package,
for employees as a whole, were:
> Annual salary - based on conditions in the
relevant geographic market, with provision
to recognise, in addition, the value of
individuals' sustained personal performance,
resulting from their ability and experience.
> Annual bonus - a lump sum payment
related to the targeted achievement of
corporate, functional and individual goals,
measured over a year and contained within
a specific plan. The corporate goals are
derived from the annual financial targets 
set by the Board and take into account
external expectations of performance. 
The functional goals are agreed by the
Remuneration Committee at the start of,
and are monitored throughout, the year.
> Longer term incentive - for selected
groups, targeted at the achievement 
of strategic objectives closely aligned with
the interests of shareholders, namely the
AstraZeneca Share Option Plan described
on pages 72 and 73 and, for some
individuals potentially, the AstraZeneca
Performance Share Plan described on
pages 73 and 74.
> Pension arrangements appropriate to the
relevant national market.
> Other benefits, such as holidays and
sickness benefit, which are cost-effective
and compatible with relevant national
welfare arrangements.
> Share participation - various plans provide
the opportunity for employees to take 
a personal stake in the Company' s wealth
creation as shareholders. 71
The way in which these elements are combined
and applied varies depending, for example, on
market need and practice in various countries.
REVIEW OF EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION IN 2004
In the 2004 Annual Report we described the
review of the Company' s executive remuneration
practice that took place in 2004.
As a result of the review, which included
consultation with shareholders, a number 
of changes were proposed, including the
introduction of the AstraZeneca Performance
Share Plan. These changes were summarised
in the Directors' Remuneration Report for
2004 and details were provided with the 2005
Notice of AGM.
The changes were intended to:
> Make the overall remuneration 
of AstraZeneca' s most senior executives
more competitive, benchmarking against
predominantly UK-based, global companies.
> Link their reward more closely to the
achievement of demanding performance
conditions.
> Increase the variable elements of reward 
as a proportion of the overall remuneration
package, when compared to the fixed
reward elements.
The changes were approved by shareholders
at the 2005 AGM.
The Company' s revised approach to senior
executive reward for Executive Directors and
members of the Senior Executive T eam (SET) 
is closely aligned to current best practice 
and includes:
> An annual bonus opportunity linked to 
a wide-ranging assessment of performance,
together with a requirement for the SET
members to defer a portion of their bonus
earned into shares for a period of three
years. As a result of the 2004 consultation
with shareholders, the basis of determining
the annual bonus for the SET members
was changed. For 2005 and beyond:
- 50% is determined by earnings per share.
- 25% by measures relating to the
individual' s particular area of responsibility
(or, in the case of the Chief Executive,
the average of these individual outcomes
for the other members of the SET).
- 25% by a balance of qualitative and
quantitative measures that address the
quality of business performance.
The Remuneration Committee reserves 
the right to modify the bonus outcome if it
believes it does not reflect the underlying
performance of the business.
> Performance conditions on exercise of
options granted under the AstraZeneca
Share Option Plan, with no re-test facility, 
in line with best practice. (This means that
the options lapse if any performance
condition is not met when the option first
becomes exercisable.)
> A requirement to hold shares equivalent 
to one-times annual salary, and to retain the
net number of shares acquired under the
AstraZeneca Share Option Plan for at least
six months after the option is exercised.
> A performance share plan, based on the
Company' s total shareholder return relative
to a global industry peer group (see separate
section below).
The Board and the Remuneration Committee
believe that bringing bonus and long term
incentive opportunities closer to the market for
other major UK-based, global companies,
subject to demanding performance conditions,
will appropriately rebalance the proportion of
reward, so that variable, performance-related
pay is dominant, and that it will significantly
improve the Company' s ability to attract and
retain executives of the quality necessary to
lead AstraZeneca in the future.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
In 2005, for each Executive Director, the
individual components were:
> Annual salary - the actual salary for each
Executive Director determined by the
Remuneration Committee on behalf of the
Board and established in sterling, with the
exception of David Brennan' s 2005 salary,
which was established in US dollars. These
salaries reflect the experience and sustained
performance of the individuals to whom
they apply, as judged annually by the
Remuneration Committee, taking account
also of market competitiveness and the
level of increases applicable to all other
employees. David Brennan's salary with
effect from 1 January 2006 is established in
sterling at  870,000 per annum and all of
David Brennan' s terms and conditions will
be UK-based, apart from his pension
arrangements, which are described below.
> Short term bonus:
- The Chief Executive was eligible for an
annual bonus related to performance
against the criteria described above.
The bonus payable was on a scale 
of 0-180% of salary, with 90% of salary
payable for the achievement of target
performance. The bonus was not
pensionable. Sir T om McKillop' s bonus
for 2005 amounts to  1,251,000.
- The Chief Financial Officer was eligible for
an annual bonus related to performance
against the criteria described above.
The bonus payable was on a scale 
of 0-150% of salary, with 75% of salary
payable for the achievement of target
performance. The bonus was not
pensionable. Jonathan Symonds'
bonus for 2005 amounts to  597,000.
- The Executive Director, Development
was eligible for an annual bonus related
to performance against the criteria
described above. The bonus payable
was on a scale of 0-150% of salary, 
with 75% of salary payable for the
achievement of target performance.
The bonus was not pensionable. John
Patterson' s bonus for 2005 amounts 
to  525,000.
- The Executive Director, North America
was eligible for an annual bonus related
to performance against the criteria
described above. The bonus payable
was on a scale of 0-150% of salary, 
with 75% of salary payable for the
achievement of target performance.
The bonus was not pensionable. David
Brennan' s bonus for 2005 amounts 
to $689,000.
> Longer term incentive - Executive Directors
are also rewarded for improvement in the
share price performance of the Company
over a period of years by the grant of share
options under the AstraZeneca Share
Option Plan. The grant of such options 
is determined by the Remuneration
Committee, as are the performance targets
that apply and whether they apply to the
grant and/or exercise of options - this is
described in more detail below. As of 2005,
Executive Directors are also now eligible to
participate in the AstraZeneca Performance
Share Plan described below.
> Pension arrangements - the table on page
76 gives details of the changes in the value
of the Executive Directors' accrued pensions
during 2005.
Directors' Remuneration Report 72
AstraZeneca Annual Report and
Form 20-F Information 2005
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
- UK Executive Directors' pension
arrangements - the Chief Executive and 
the Executive Director, Development are
members of the Company' s main UK
defined benefit pension plan. The
normal pension age under this plan is
62. However, a member' s accrued
pension is available from age 60 without
any actuarial reduction. In addition, the
accrued pension is available, unreduced,
from age 57 if the Company consents to
a request for early retirement and from
age 50 if the retirement is at the
Company' s request.
On death in retirement, the accrued
pension is guaranteed payable for the
first five years of retirement and then
reduces to two-thirds of this amount
should there be a surviving spouse or
other dependent. Any member may
choose higher or lower levels of
survivor' s pensions at retirement,
subject to HM Revenue & Customs
limits, in return for an adjustment to their
own pension of equivalent actuarial
value. Pensions are also payable to
dependent children. In the event of a
senior employee becoming
incapacitated, then a pension is payable
immediately as if such person had
reached normal retirement age (subject
to a maximum of 10 years' additional
service), based on current pensionable
salary. In the event of a member' s death
prior to retirement, dependents are
entitled to a pension of two-thirds of the
pension that would have been earned
had the deceased remained in service to
age 62, plus a capital sum of four times
pensionable pay . Pensions in payment
are increased annually in line with
inflation, as measured by the UK Retail
Prices Index, up to a maximum of 5%.
In respect of UK Executive Directors
whose pensionable earnings are
capped by the earnings limit imposed
by the Finance Act 1989, unapproved
defined contribution schemes are made
available. Currently, only the Chief
Financial Officer is affected by this limit.
The Company has agreed to pay
annually 50% of base salary in excess of
the statutory earnings cap for the
pension and associated tax liability, with
the intention of providing equivalence of
benefits with non-capped UK Executive
Directors. If this does not provide
equivalence, the Company has agreed
to make up the difference. 
The benefits derived from equivalence
are shown in the table on page 76 as if
the scheme were a defined benefit
arrangement. The Company
contribution in 2005 in respect of the
pension element was  130,000
($238,000).
- US Executive Directors' pension
arrangements - David Brennan (as the
Executive Director, North America
during 2005 and as the Chief Executive
Officer from 2006 onwards) is a member
of the AstraZeneca US Defined Benefit
Pension Plan, under a schedule
applicable to legacy Astra Merck
employees. Benefits for members of this
plan are delivered on a tax-qualified
basis, with accrued benefits that exceed
specific limits under the plan' s formula
and the US T ax Code being delivered
through a supplementary, non-qualified
pension plan. The normal pension age
under both plans is 65. The tax-qualified
plan has unreduced, early retirement
benefits payable at age 62, or earlier if:
- combined age and service at
retirement equals or exceeds 85; and
- at 1 July 1996, combined age and
service was equal to or exceeded 60;
and
- the member was categorised as a
non-highly compensated employee.
Similar early retirement terms apply to
the supplementary, non-qualified plan,
as it relates to highly compensated
employees.
The US Defined Benefit Pension Plan
and the supplementary, non-qualified
pension plan have a service cap at 35
years' service, after which no further
service accrual is earned.
On death in retirement, there is a
pension payable to the surviving spouse
or other dependent if the member so
elects prior to retirement. The pension
plan provides for continuation of service
credit in the event of disability until age
65, death or commencement of benefit.
In the event of death prior to retirement,
pre-survivor retirement benefits are
payable under the pension plan and
under the insurance plans available to all
US employees.
Members and surviving spouses/
dependents can elect to take pensions
in lump-sum form based on actuarial
valuation.
> Other customary benefits (such as a car
and health benefits) are also made available
through participation in the Company' s
flexible benefits arrangements, which
extend to the vast majority of the Company' s
UK, Swedish and US employees. 
Performance targets and measurement
Each year, as referred to above, both shorter-
term and longer-term objectives are agreed
with the Board and regularly monitored, 
in respect of both individual business functions
and integrated corporate strategy, in the
business performance report. Performance
against these objectives determines functional
bonuses and, separately, whether or not share
options will be granted.
In respect of bonuses in 2005, relevant factors
again included financial results ahead of
expectations and excellent progress in key
areas. Earnings per share increased by 41%
compared to 2004; global sales increased 
by 10% overall and by 27% for key growth
products (all at constant exchange rates). 
A supplemental New Drug Application was
submitted to the FDA for a new indication for
Seroquel. The development pipeline was
strengthened, with four new chemical entities
entering phase 3 development, and further
augmented by three licensing transactions
and the acquisition of KuDOS Pharmaceuticals.
These achievements were underpinned 
by a continuing emphasis on cost discipline,
improved productivity and performance
management. Bonus outcomes reflected
overall corporate and relevant functional
performance in 2005 against clear objectives.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee 
took into account a balance of measures
addressing the quality of these annual results
to ensure that the bonus outcomes reflected
the underlying performance and strategic
direction of the business.
ASTRAZENECA SHARE OPTION PLAN
The AstraZeneca Share Option Plan was
approved at the AGM in 2000 following prior
consultation with major shareholders. Its design
took account of the overall competitiveness 
of the Company' s remuneration arrangements
for senior executives and US employees 
in the context of the Company' s peers in the
pharmaceutical industry.
The plan, as approved at that time and operated
subsequently, required that the Remuneration
Committee must, before agreeing the grant 
of options to Executive Directors and others,
be satisfied that both the most recent and the
underlying performance of the Company justify
each grant; in addition, it must be satisfied 
that each individual to whom options are
proposed to be granted has achieved the
necessary performance. 73
In agreeing grants of options for 2005, the
Remuneration Committee took into account
that, in the four years prior to the date of grant,
AstraZeneca' s share price had consistently
outperformed the market; in 2004, profits had
increased by 15% over 2003; earnings per
share had increased by 18% and were above
market expectations; and the dividend
increased by 18%. In addition, Group sales
increased in 2004 by 9% at constant exchange
rates, with a 30% increase for the key growth
products of Nexium, Seroquel and Symbicort.
Although sales of Crestor in 2004 had been
adversely affected by allegations regarding the
product' s safety, in March 2005 the FDA
denied a request that Crestor be withdrawn
from the market and stated that data
supported the conclusion that for any degree
of LDL-lowering, [Crestor ]is as safe, and may
well be safer than, any other marketed statin
with regard to muscle toxicity , providing
encouragement for future sales prospects.
Strong sales growth continued in emerging
markets, for example 34% in China. With
regard to R&D, at the end of 2004 there were
40% more projects in clinical development than
at the end of the previous year and 20% more
projects in pre-clinical testing. All these
improvements took place against a
background of strict cost control in all
commercial, operational and service functions.
In addition to these performance considerations
taken into account at the point of granting
options, the Remuneration Committee decided
to introduce testing performance conditions 
in respect of the exercise of such granted
options for members of the Senior Executive
T eam, as referred to on page 71.
The Remuneration Committee also sought
and received assurances that all individuals
proposed for a grant of options had been
performing in a manner that justified a grant 
to them. It was noted that there was some
variation in the level of grants being proposed
between individuals, to reflect differing levels 
of performance.
The dilutive effect of the proposed grants of
options on the Company' s issued share capital
was also considered by the Remuneration
Committee, in accordance with its commitment
that the percentage of the issued share capital
that could be allocated under all of the
Company' s employee share plans over 
a period of 10 years should be under 10%. This
commitment is applied by the Remuneration
Committee in practice as a limit, on average, 
of under 1% per annum. The Remuneration
Committee concluded that a grant of options to
those plan participants and individual Executive
Directors proposed for a grant was appropriate
given the level of performance achieved.
For the grants of options since 2004 to
members of the Senior Executive T eam, 
the Remuneration Committee has included 
a condition to the effect that, if an event occurs
which causes material reputational damage 
to the Company, such that it is not appropriate
for the options to vest and become exercisable,
the Remuneration Committee can make 
a determination to that effect.
ASTRAZENECA PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN
As mentioned above, one of the changes
announced by the Company following the
2004 review of executive remuneration was the
introduction of a new AstraZeneca Performance
Share Plan (the Plan ). Details of the Plan
were contained in the 2005 Notice of AGM
and were presented to, and approved by,
shareholders at the April 2005 AGM.
Grant and vesting of Awards
The Plan provides for the grant of performance
share awards (Awards ) in respect of Ordinary
Shares in AstraZeneca PLC (Shares ) (which
may be delivered in the form of American
Depositary Shares in the US). Save in exceptional
circumstances, vesting of Awards is contingent
on the satisfaction of specified performance
targets and continued employment with the
AstraZeneca Group. Awards are not
pensionable and may not be assigned or
transferred (except on a participant' s death,
when they may be assigned to the
participant' s personal representatives).
Basis of participation
The Remuneration Committee is responsible
for agreeing any Awards under the Plan and
for setting the policy for the way in which the
Plan should be operated, including agreeing
performance targets and which employees
should be invited to participate in the Plan. 
All employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries, including Executive Directors, 
are eligible to participate, although an employee
may not be granted an Award if he or she is
within six months from retirement. In practice,
participation will be highly selective and
performance-driven.
Generally, Awards can be granted at any time,
but not during a close period of the Company.
The first grant of Awards was made on 29 June
2005 (the Initial Award ), details of which 
are shown in the table on page 78. Thereafter,
the majority of Awards are likely to be made at
or around the same time as options are granted
under the AstraZeneca Share Option Plan. 
No payment is required for the grant of Awards.
Performance period
An Award may not generally vest before the
third anniversary of its date of grant nor unless
the specified performance target(s) have been
met at the end of a three year period. In the case
of the Initial Award, the performance target
relates to the three year period commencing
on 1 January 2005.
Performance targets
For the Initial Award, the performance target
will be the Company' s T otal Shareholder
Return (TSR ) over the three year period
commencing on 1 January 2005 compared 
to the TSR of a selected peer group of 12 other
pharmaceutical companies for the same period.
These companies are:
Abbott Laboratories, Bristol-Myers Squibb, 
Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson,
Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, Sanofi-Aventis,
Schering-Plough and Wyeth.
Awards will vest on the basis of the Company' s
TSR ranking and the vesting schedule set 
out below:
TSRranking Vestingpercentage
of the Company of shares under Award
Below median 0%
Median 30%
Upper quartile 100%
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata
T o alleviate any short term volatility, the return
index is averaged in the TSR calculations for
each company over the three months prior to
the start and end of the performance period.
The vesting date for the Initial Award is the third
anniversary of the 29 June 2005 grant date.
In addition to the TSR performance target being
met for the Initial Award as set out above, the
Remuneration Committee also has to satisfy
itself that achievement of the TSR performance
target is a genuine reflection of the Company' s
underlying financial performance.
The Remuneration Committee has the
discretion to award Shares up to a further 
25% over and above the Shares subject to the
Award, if the Company' s TSR performance 
is substantially better than that of the upper
quartile of the comparator group.
The Remuneration Committee may vary 
or waive these performance target(s) to take
account of events that lead the Remuneration
Committee, acting fairly and reasonably, to
believe the performance target(s) to be no longer
appropriate. Any variation to the performance
target(s) made by the Remuneration Committee
will not result in the revised performance target(s)
being, in the opinion of the Remuneration
Committee, more difficult or easier to satisfy
than the initial performance target(s).
Directors' Remuneration Report 74
AstraZeneca Annual Report and
Form 20-F Information 2005
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Individual limit
In respect of any financial year, the maximum
market value of Shares that may be put under
Award in respect of an employee is 500% 
of that employee' s basic salary. This limit
excludes the above 25% maximum additional
Shares that may vest, at the sole discretion 
of the Remuneration Committee, if the
Company' s TSR performance is substantially
above that of the upper quartile of the
comparator group.
The actual individual limits that apply under the
Plan are set by the Remuneration Committee
from time to time. 
Cessation of employment before 
an Award has vested
If a participant ceases employment with the
AstraZeneca group before an Award has
vested at the end of the relevant period, his 
or her Award(s) will generally lapse. However, 
if a participant dies or leaves employment in
certain circumstances such as ill health, injury,
disability, retirement, redundancy or his or her
employing business being sold or transferred
outside the AstraZeneca group, the Award will,
absent additional action by the Remuneration
Committee, vest pro rata to the time elapsed
between the date of grant of the Award and
the date of cessation of employment, at the end
of the relevant performance period, subject to
the satisfaction of the performance target(s)
measured over the relevant performance period.
In view of Sir T om McKillop' s retirement on 
31 December 2005, the Award granted to him
in 2005 will be appropriately pro-rated and will
vest in 2008 subject to the satisfaction of the
performance target measured over the whole
performance period. Having left the Company
six months after the start of the 36 month
vesting period, Sir T om will receive Shares
representing approximately one sixth of the
value of the Award (if any) when it vests in 2008.
Performance under the AstraZeneca
Performance Share Plan in 2005
As mentioned above, the Initial Award was made
under the Plan on 29 June 2005 and is listed 
in the table on page 78. TSR looks at share price
increase and dividends re-invested in respect
of a notional number of shares, from the
beginning of the performance period to the end
of it, and ranks the companies in the selected
comparator group by reference to the TSR
achieved over that period. The rank which the
Company' s TSR achieves over the performance
period will determine how many Shares will
vest under the Initial Award, as per the vesting
schedule shown in the table on page 73.
The Peer Group Graph  on page 77 shows
how the Company' s TSR performance has
compared with the TSR for the companies 
in the comparator group from 1 January 2005
(the first day of the performance period) to 
31 December 2005 and how the Company
ranks against those other companies on this
basis. We will continue to report on the
performance of each Award against the
relevant performance target(s) during the
relevant vesting period.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' SERVICE CONTRACTS
The service contracts of the current Executive
Directors provide for a notice period of one
year. For new Executive Directors, the Board
would aim to negotiate a one year notice
period. In exceptional circumstances, the initial
notice period may be for longer than one year.
In those circumstances, the Board would
explain to shareholders the reasons why it
believed a longer notice period was necessary
and it would be the Board' s intention that it
should be reduced to one year subsequently.
At the time of the AGM on 27 April 2006, the
unexpired term of Executive Directors' service
contracts will be a maximum of one year. 
The details of the Executive Directors'
individual service contracts are set out in 
the table below. In the event of the termination
of an Executive Director' s service contract,
depending upon the circumstances, the
Company may be liable to provide
compensation to the Executive Director
equivalent to the benefits which he or she
would have received during the contractual
notice period. For current Executive Directors,
it is the Company' s expectation that any such
liability would be calculated on the basis 
of one year' s base salary, target bonus and
other benefits. The Company' s policy in the
event of the termination of an Executive
Director' s service contract is to avoid any
liability to the Executive Director in excess 
of his or her contractual entitlement and aim 
to ensure that any liability is mitigated to the
fullest extent possible.
ARRANGEMENTS FOR  KE STAVLING
  ke Stavling, formerly an Executive Director,
left the Company at the end of January 2003.
Mr Stavling' s leaving arrangements were fully
disclosed in the Directors' Remuneration
Report for 2003. Under these arrangements,
Mr Stavling received monthly compensation
from the Company until the end of January
2005. The sum received by Mr Stavling in
January 2005 is included in the disclosure 
of Directors' emoluments on page 75. 
These arrangements have now ceased.
POSITION OF THE NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
None of the Non-Executive Directors has a
service contract. They are not eligible for
performance-related bonuses or the grant

In advance of the changes to the tax treatment of pensions in the UK, which will take effect from 6 April 2006, the Remuneration Committee
considered the impact those changes may have on UK Executive Directors' pension arrangements. The Remuneration Committee has endorsed
the offer of a cash allowance in lieu of future pension, payable at the election of each individual Executive Director. The cash allowance will be
consistent with the cost of the alternative gross pension benefit.
This approach was considered in the context of:
> The Company' s desire to offer employees flexibility and choice in their reward packages.
> The Company' s policies of funded, defined contribution pension provision.
> The Company' s desire to ensure it does not respond to tax changes in a way that would effectively deliver a guaranteed  net' pension promise.
> The requirement that any alternative to pension should be cost-neutral to the Company.
Any resulting impact of this on the presentation of the Executive Directors' pension arrangements will be provided in the Directors'
Remuneration Report for 2006. 
In the tables on page 75, salaries have been converted between sterling and US dollars at the average exchange rate for the year in question.
These rates were:
Some Directors and officers were also granted options to subscribe for Ordinary Shares under the Company' s share option plans and awards
under the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan (or, in the case of David Brennan, the AstraZeneca US Executive Performance Share Plan). Details
of share options granted to, and exercised by, Directors and the aggregate of gains realised on exercised options, and of awards under the above
performance share plans, in the year are given on pages 78 to 80.
No Director or officer has a family relationship with any other Director or officer.

TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN GRAPHS
The UK Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the inclusion in the Directors' Remuneration Report of a graph showing total
shareholder return (TSR) over a five year period in respect of a holding of the Company' s shares, plotted against TSR in respect of a hypothetical
holding of shares of a similar kind and number by reference to which a broad equity market index is calculated. The Company is a member of the
FTSE 100 Index and consequently , for the purposes of this graph which is set out below, we have selected the FTSE 100 Index as the appropriate
index. This graph is re-based to 100 at the start of the rolling five year period.
The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan (the Plan ) summarised on pages 73 and 74 requires that the total shareholder return (TSR) in respect of a holding
of the Company' s shares over the relevant performance period be compared with the TSR of a peer group of 12 other pharmaceutical companies.
The graph below shows how the Company' s TSR performance has compared with the TSR for the companies in the comparator group from 1 January
2005 (the first day of the current three year performance period) to 31 December 2005 and how the Company ranks against those other companies
on this basis. T o alleviate any short term volatility, the return index is averaged in the TSR calculations for each company over the three months prior
to the start of the performance period (as stipulated in the Plan) and, for the purposes of this interim snapshot, over the last three months of 2005.

Unitised stock plans
David Brennan, in common with other participating US executives, has interests in the following: the AstraZeneca Executive Deferral Plan, 
the AstraZeneca Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and the AstraZeneca Savings and Security Plan. These are unitised stock plans and
participants hold units in each plan. A unit comprises part cash and part ADSs. The overall unit price is determined daily by taking the market 
value of the underlying ADSs and adding the cash position. The ADSs held within these units carry both voting and dividend rights. Mr Brennan 
is deemed to have a notional interest in these ADSs, calculated by reference to the fund value and the closing price of AstraZeneca ADSs. 
As the value of the unit varies the number of ADSs attached to each unit varies. Therefore the number of ADSs held within each unit varies daily.
