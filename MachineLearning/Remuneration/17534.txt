REMUNERATION COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
AND MEETINGS
The members of the Remuneration Committee
are Sir Peter Bonfield (Chairman of the
Committee), John Buchanan, Joe Jimenez,
Erna M ller and (since 26 July 2006)
John Varley. They are all Non-Executive
Directors. The Board considers them all to
be independent. (Independence of Non-
Executive Directors is discussed in more
detail in the Directors' Report on page 76.)
Sir Peter Bonfield and Erna M ller do not
intend to submit themselves for re-election
at the AGM in 2007, and Sir Peter' s role as
Chairman of the Committee will be assumed
by John Varley.
The Remuneration Committee met four times
in 2006. Each meeting was attended by all of
its members, except that other commitments
prevented John Buchanan from attending
the meetings on 1 February and 6 December.
John Varley joined the Committee on 26 July
and only attended meetings after that date.
At the request of the Remuneration Committee,
David Brennan (Chief Executive Officer),
T ony Bloxham (Executive Vice-President,
Human Resources), Peter Brown (Vice-
President, Global Compensation and Benefits)
and Louis Schweitzer (Chairman), as well as
the Secretary of the Remuneration Committee,
Graeme Musker, attended all of its meetings
in 2006, except when their own remuneration
was being discussed. They provided advice
and services that materially assisted the
Remuneration Committee during the year.
In doing so, Mr Brown drew on various
sources of data concerning directors' and
executives' salaries, bonus levels and other
incentives including general pharmaceutical
industry reports and surveys, as well as surveys
specifically carried out for the Company.
These included certain surveys prepared for
the Company by T owers Perrin. 
During 2006, Ms Carol Arrowsmith of Deloitte
again provided the Remuneration Committee
with independent advice on all matters being
considered by it. During 2006, Deloitte also
provided taxation advice and other non-audit
services to the Company.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REMIT
The remit of the Remuneration Committee is
as follows:
(i) After appropriate consultation with the
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
to make recommendations to the Board
on the Company' s policy for executive
remuneration and to determine, on behalf
of the Board, the entire individual
remuneration package, including the
terms and conditions of employment
and the retirement/severance provisions
in relation to the Chairman, the Deputy
Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer,
Executive Directors, the Secretary and
such other senior managers as may be
determined by the Chief Executive Officer.
In formulating its proposals, the Committee
is required to give such persons every
encouragement to enhance the Company' s
performance and to ensure that they are
fairly, but responsibly, rewarded for their
individual contributions.
(ii) To make recommendations to the Board
for the Company' s Executive Share Option
Scheme and Employee and Executive
Performance Bonus Schemes (and any
other similar schemes) and to exercise the
powers of the Directors under the rules of
such schemes.
(iii) At all times to ensure that the Company
complies to the fullest extent appropriate
and practicable with the Combined Code
setting out Principles of Good Governance
and the Code of Best Practice annexed
to the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority.
A copy of the Remuneration Committee' s
remit is available on the Company' s website

OVERALL REMUNERATION POLICY AND PURPOSE
In determining the level of Directors'
remuneration, the Remuneration Committee
considers the policies, practices and other
factors that relate to all employees, as set
out below.
In general, the Company is committed to
maintaining a dynamic performance culture,
in which every employee is clear about the
Company' s objectives, and knows how their
work impacts on those objectives and that
they will benefit from achieving high levels
of performance. It is against this background
that the specific remuneration of the
Executive Directors and other members
of the Senior Executive T eam (SET) is
considered in the deliberations of the Board
and the Remuneration Committee. 
Consistent with its approach during the year,
the Board has confirmed that the Company' s
overall remuneration policy and purpose
going forward will continue to be:
> Attract and retain people of the quality
necessary to sustain the Company as one
of the best pharmaceutical companies in
the world.
> Motivate them to achieve the level of
performance necessary to create
sustained growth in shareholder value.
In order to achieve this, remuneration policy
and practice are designed to:
> Closely align individual and team reward
with business performance at each level.
> Encourage employees to perform to their
fullest capacity.
> Encourage employees to align their
interests with those of shareholders.
> Support managers' responsibility to
achieve business performance through
people and to recognise superior
performance, in the short and longer term.
> Be as locally focused and flexible as is
practicable and beneficial.
> Be as internally consistent as is practicable
and beneficial, taking due account of
market need.
> Be competitive and cost-effective in each
of the relevant employment markets.
The cost and value of the components of
the remuneration package are considered
as a whole and are designed to:
> Ensure a proper balance of fixed and
variable performance-related components,
linked to short- and longer-term objectives.
> Reflect market competitiveness.
PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF
EMPLOYEE REMUNERATION
Throughout 2006, as in 2005, the principal
components of the total remuneration
package, for employees as a whole, were:
> Annual salary - based on conditions in the
relevant geographic market, with provision
to recognise, in addition, the value of an
individual's sustained personal performance,
resulting from their ability and experience.
> Annual bonus - a lump-sum payment
related to the targeted achievement of
corporate, functional and individual goals,
measured over a year and contained
within a specific plan. The corporate goals
are derived from the annual financial targets
set by the Board and take into account
external expectations of performance.
The functional goals are agreed by the
Remuneration Committee at the start of,
and are monitored throughout, the year.
Bonuses are not pensionable.
> Longer-term incentives - for selected
groups, targeted at the achievement of
strategic objectives closely aligned with
the interests of shareholders, namely the
AstraZeneca Share Option Plan described
on pages 85 and 86 and, for some
individuals potentially, the AstraZeneca
Performance Share Plan described on
pages 86 and 87.
> Pension arrangements appropriate to the
relevant national market.
> Other benefits, such as holidays and
sickness benefit, which are cost-effective
and compatible with relevant national
welfare arrangements.
> Share participation - various plans
provide the opportunity for employees
to take a personal stake in the Company' s
wealth creation as shareholders. These
plans are described in Note 25 to the
Financial Statements.
The way in which these elements are combined
and applied varies depending, for example, on
market need and practice in various countries.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
In 2006, for each Executive Director, the
individual components were:
> Annual salary - the actual salary for each
Executive Director determined by the
Remuneration Committee on behalf of
the Board and established in sterling.
These salaries reflect the experience and
sustained performance of the individuals
to whom they apply, as judged annually
by the Remuneration Committee, taking
account also of market competitiveness
and the level of increases applicable to all
other employees. The Company seeks to
position salaries at or slightly above the
median of the market, benchmarked
against comparable jobs in the countries
in which officers normally work, primarily
in pharmaceutical companies or companies
with levels of global operation similar
to those of AstraZeneca. All Executive
Directors' terms and conditions are
UK-based, apart from David Brennan' s
pension (including health insurance)
arrangements, which are described below.
For 2007, the Executive Directors' revised
annual salaries are as follows:
- David Brennan  940,000 (this
represents an increase of 8.05%
over his 2006 salary);
- John Patterson  504,692 (this
represents an increase of 3.50%
over his 2006 salary); and
- Jonathan Symonds  600,000 (this
represents an increase of 8.15% over
his 2006 salary).
> Short-term bonus:
- The Chief Executive Officer was
eligible for an annual bonus related to
performance against the criteria
described below. The bonus payable
was on a scale of 0-180% of salary,
with 90% of salary payable for the
achievement of target performance.
The bonus was not pensionable.
David Brennan's bonus for 2006
amounts to  1,049,220 (120.6% of
salary). For 2007, the bonus range will
be the same. - The Chief Financial Officer was
eligible for an annual bonus related
to performance against the criteria
described below. The bonus payable
was on a scale of 0-150% of salary,
with 75% of salary payable for the
achievement of target performance.
The bonus was not pensionable.
Jonathan Symonds' bonus for 2006
amounted to  566,936 (102.2% of
salary). For 2007, the bonus range will
be the same.
- The Executive Director, Development
was eligible for an annual bonus related
to performance against the criteria
described below. The bonus payable
was on a scale of 0-150% of salary,
with 75% of salary payable for the
achievement of target performance.
The bonus was not pensionable.
John Patterson' s bonus for 2006
amounted to  489,124 (100.3% of
salary). For 2007, the bonus range will
be the same.
Since the 2004 consultation with
shareholders, the performance criteria for
determining the annual bonus for Executive
Directors (and other SET members) have
been as follows:
- 50% by reference to earnings per share.
- 25% by measures relating to
the individual' s particular area of
responsibility (or, in the case of the
Chief Executive Officer, the average
of these individual outcomes for the
other members of the SET).
- 25% by a balance of qualitative and
quantitative measures that address
the quality of business performance
(discussed below under Performance
targets and measurement ).
There is a requirement for SET members
to defer a portion of their bonus earned
into shares for a period of three years.
The portion currently deferred into shares
is one third of the pre-tax bonus for
Executive Directors and one sixth for
all other SET members. On leaving,
participants would normally have to wait
for the shares to be released at the end of
the three-year period. The Remuneration
Committee reserves the right to modify
the bonus outcome if it believes it does
not reflect the underlying performance
of the business.
> Longer-term incentives:
- Executive Directors are also rewarded
for improvement in the share price
performance of the Company over
a period of years by the grant of share
options under the AstraZeneca Share
Option Plan. The grant of such options
is determined by the Remuneration
Committee, as are the performance
targets that apply and whether they
apply to the grant and/or exercise of
options - this is described in more
detail below.
- In 2006, Executive Directors (and other
members of the SET) were also eligible
to participate in the AstraZeneca
Performance Share Plan described
below.
> An expectation to hold shares equivalent
to one-times annual salary, and to retain
the net number of shares acquired under
the AstraZeneca Share Option Plan for at
least six months after the option is
exercised.
> Other customary benefits (such as a car
and health benefits) are also made available
through participation in the Company' s
flexible benefits arrangements, which
extend to the vast majority of the Company' s
UK, Swedish and US employees. 
> Pension arrangements, as described below.
PENSION ARRANGEMENTS
The table on page 89 gives details of the
changes in the value of the Executive
Directors' accrued pensions during 2006.
US Executive Directors'
pension arrangements
David Brennan (the Chief Executive Officer) is
a member of the AstraZeneca US Defined
Benefit Pension Plan, under a schedule
applicable to legacy Astra Merck employees.
Benefits for members of this plan are
delivered on a tax-qualified basis, with
accrued benefits that exceed specific limits
under the plan' s formula and the US T ax
Code being delivered through a
supplementary, non-qualified pension plan
(accruals in respect of the UK service being
booked in the UK accounts). The normal
pension age under both plans is 65. The tax-
qualified plan has unreduced, early
retirement benefits payable at age 62, or
earlier if:
> combined age and service at retirement
equals or exceeds 85; and
> at 1 July 1996, combined age and service
was equal to or exceeded 60; and
> the member was categorised as a non-
highly-compensated employee.
Similar early retirement terms apply to the
supplementary, non-qualified plan, as it
relates to highly-compensated employees.
The US Defined Benefit Pension Plan and the
supplementary, non-qualified pension plan
have a service cap at 35 years' service, after
which no further service accrual is earned.
On death in retirement, there is a pension
payable to the surviving spouse or other
dependant if the member so elects prior
to retirement. The pension plan provides for
continuation of service credit in the event of
disability until age 65, death or commencement
of benefit. In the event of death prior to
retirement, pre-survivor retirement benefits
are payable under the pension plan and
under the insurance plans available to all
US employees.
Members and surviving spouses/dependants
can elect to take pensions in lump-sum form
based on actuarial valuation.
UK Executive Directors'
pension arrangements 
Certain changes to the tax treatment of
pensions in the UK took effect from 6 April 2006.
The Remuneration Committee considered
the impact those changes may have on UK
Executive Directors' pension arrangements.
The Remuneration Committee endorsed the
offer of a cash allowance in lieu of future
pension, offered annually and payable at the
election of each individual Executive Director.
The cash allowance is consistent with the
cost of the alternative gross pension benefit.
This approach was considered in the
context of:
> The Company' s desire to offer
employees flexibility and choice in their
reward packages.
> The Company' s policies of funded,
defined contribution pension provision.
> The Company' s desire to ensure it does
not respond to tax changes in a way that
would effectively deliver a guaranteed
 net' pension promise.
> The requirement that any alternative
to pension should be cost-neutral to
the Company.
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
84 ASTRAZENECA ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 20-F INFORMATION 2006 85 DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
The Executive Director, Development has
elected to remain a member of the Company' s
main UK defined benefit pension plan for the
option year 2006/7 rather than take the cash
allowance. The normal pension age under
this plan is 62. However, a member' s accrued
pension is available from age 60 without any
actuarial reduction. In addition, the accrued
pension is available, unreduced, from age 57
if the Company consents to a request for
early retirement and from age 50 if the
retirement is at the Company' s request.
On death in retirement, the accrued pension
is guaranteed payable for the first five years
of retirement and then reduces to two-thirds
of this amount should there be a surviving
spouse or other dependant. Any member
may choose higher or lower levels of
survivor' s pensions at retirement, subject
to HM Revenue & Customs limits, in return
for an adjustment to their own pension of
equivalent actuarial value. Pensions are also
payable to dependent children.
In the event of a senior employee becoming
incapacitated, then a pension is payable
immediately as if such person had reached
normal retirement age (subject to a maximum
of 10 years' additional service), based on
current pensionable salary. In the event of
a member' s death prior to retirement,
dependants are entitled to a pension of two-
thirds of the pension that would have been
earned had the deceased remained in service
to age 62, plus a capital sum of four times
pensionable pay.
Pensions in payment are increased annually
in line with inflation, as measured by the UK
Retail Prices Index, up to a maximum of 5%.
The Chief Financial Officer benefits from a
pension promise equivalent to membership
of the defined benefit pension plan that applies
to the Executive Director, Development. The
composition of the promise originates from
the application of the statutory earnings cap,
which has now been removed following the
April 2006 tax changes to the treatment of
pensions in the UK. The equivalent pension
promise remains unchanged. It is delivered
through a combination of: 
> Annual payment by the Company of 26%
of base salary. (The Company payment is
calculated as 30% of base salary less the
required member contribution of 4%.)
The Company contribution in 2006 for
Jonathan Symonds in respect of the
pension element was  172,000. This
payment represents three months at the
pre-April rate of 50% and nine months at
the new rate.
> T o the extent this payment does not
provide equivalence to the UK defined
benefit pension plan, the Company makes
up the difference. The benefits derived
from equivalence are shown in the table
on page 89 as if the scheme were a
defined benefit arrangement. 
Performance targets and measurement
Each year, as referred to above, both short-
term and longer-term objectives are agreed
with the Board and regularly monitored, in
respect of both individual business functions
and integrated corporate strategy, in the
Business Performance Management (BPM)
report. Performance against these objectives
determines functional bonuses and, separately ,
whether or not share options will be granted.
In respect of bonuses for 2006, relevant
factors included strong financial results ahead
of expectations and excellent progress in key
areas. Earnings per share increased by 34%
compared to 2005; global sales increased
by 1 1% overall and by 23% for key growth
products; operating profit increased by 28%
and R&D investment by 16% (all at constant
exchange rates). The development pipeline
was strengthened and now comprises 120
projects (compared with 106 a year earlier),
including 95 new chemical entities and 25
life-cycle management projects. Significant
externalisation activity included six significant
licence and acquisition transactions signed
during the calendar year, among them the
acquisition of Cambridge Antibody T echnology
Group plc. Good progress was made in life-
cycle management, with nine submissions
and nine approvals in the US or EU, including
the submissions for Crestor (atherosclerosis)
andSeroquel SR (schizophrenia) in both
the EU and US. These achievements were
underpinned by a continuing emphasis on
cost discipline, improved productivity and
performance management. Bonus outcomes
for 2006 reflected overall corporate and
relevant functional performance in 2006
against clear objectives in relation to:
> financial performance;
> progress in R&D;
> risk management;
> executive development and succession;
> corporate governance and social
responsibility; and 
> reputation.
During 2006, the BPM framework was
reviewed, with a view to further enhancing
our focus on our strategic objectives. Bonus
outcomes for 2007 will reflect overall corporate
and relevant functional performance against
clear objectives in relation to:
> patients;
> products;
> people; and
> performance.
More information about these objectives is
set out on pages1 1 and 15 of the Business
Review.
ASTRAZENECA SHARE OPTION PLAN
The AstraZeneca Share Option Plan, as
approved at the AGM in 2000 and operated
subsequently, requires that the Remuneration
Committee must, before agreeing the grant
of options to Executive Directors and others,
be satisfied that both the most recent and the
underlying performance of the Company
justify each grant; and that each individual to
whom options are proposed to be granted
has achieved the necessary performance.
In agreeing grants of options during 2006,
the Remuneration Committee took into
account that, the AstraZeneca share price
increased by 53.5% between January 2005
and January 2006, outperforming that of
every major US, European Union and Swiss
pharmaceutical company; dividends increased
by 38% to $1.30 for the full year; earnings per
share for 2005, at $2.91, were ahead of
market expectations and up 41% on the
previous year and profits increased by 39%,
to $6.5 billion in 2005. In addition, costs
remained strictly controlled throughout the
value chain, with significant productivity
gains achieved and people costs as a
percentage of operating costs remained
flat at 33% whereas operating profit per
employee increased by 41.5% to $100,200.
Group sales increased in 2005 by 10% to
$23.95 billion. In relation to research and
development, expenditure totalled $3.4 billion
in 2005, including new investment in laboratory
facilities. Productivity increased in 2005,
with 25 candidate drugs selected for the
early development portfolio (compared
with 18 in 2004 and 15 in 2003); four new
chemical entities were entered into Phase III
development. There were 45 projects in the pre-clinical phase and 17, 15 and 29
projects in Phases I, II and III respectively.
The Company' s outward focus has increased
considerably, with three licensing transactions
completed in 2005. These will have the effect
of augmenting the development pipeline
with two Phase II compounds and one
Phase III compound. In addition, the
acquisition of KuDOS Pharmaceuticals
Limited was announced in December 2005.
As well as taking into account these
performance considerations at the point
of granting options, the Remuneration
Committee imposed testing performance
conditions in respect of the exercise of such
granted options for members of the SET .
In order for the options to vest, EPS must
increase by the UK retail price index plus
5% per annum on average, for three years
following grant, with no re-test.
The Remuneration Committee also sought
and received assurances that all individuals
proposed for a grant of options had been
performing in a manner that justified a grant
to them. It was noted that there was some
variation in the level of grants being proposed
between individuals, to reflect differing levels
of performance.
The dilutive effect of the proposed grants
of options on the Company' s issued share
capital was also considered by the
Remuneration Committee, in accordance
with its commitment that the percentage of
the issued share capital that could be allocated
under all of the Company' s employee share
plans over a period of 10 years should be
under 10%. This commitment is applied by
the Remuneration Committee in practice as
a limit, on average, of under 1% per annum.
The Remuneration Committee concluded that
a grant of options to those plan participants
and individual Executive Directors proposed
for a grant was appropriate given the level of
performance achieved.
For the grants of options to members
of the SET , since the review of executive
remuneration in 2004, the Remuneration
Committee has included a condition to the
effect that, if an event occurs which causes
material reputational damage to the
Company, such that it is not appropriate for
the options to vest and become exercisable,
the Remuneration Committee can make a
determination to that effect.
The Company has a policy prohibiting
the backdating of share options and no
backdating of the grant of share options has
taken place on any occasion. The exercise
price is fixed by reference to the market
price of AstraZeneca shares over the three-
day period preceding the date of grant.
The Remuneration Committee approves all
grants of options shortly before the grant date.
ASTRAZENECA PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN
One of the changes announced by the
Company following the 2004 review of
executive remuneration was the introduction
of a new AstraZeneca Performance Share
Plan (the Plan ). In last year' s report, we
described the first year of operation of the
new Plan. 
Grant and vesting of Awards
The Plan provides for the grant of performance
share awards (Awards ) in respect of Ordinary
Shares in AstraZeneca PLC (Shares )
(which may be delivered in the form of
American Depositary Shares in the US).
Save in exceptional circumstances, which
are prescribed in the Plan rules or at the
discretion of the Remuneration Committee,
vesting of Awards is contingent on the
satisfaction of specified performance
targets and continued employment with
the AstraZeneca Group. Awards are not
pensionable and may not be assigned or
transferred (except on a participant' s death,
when they may be assigned to the participant' s
personal representatives).
Basis of participation
The Remuneration Committee is responsible
for agreeing any Awards under the Plan and
for setting the policy for the way in which the
Plan should be operated, including agreeing
performance targets and which employees
should be invited to participate in the Plan.
All employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries, including Executive Directors, are
eligible to participate. In practice, participation
is highly selective and performance-driven.
Generally, Awards can be granted at any time,
but not during a close period of the Company.
As reported last year , the first grant of Awards
was made on 29 June 2005 (the 2005 Award ).
In 2006, grants of Awards were made on
24 March and 19 May (the 2006 Award ). 
Details of these grants are shown in the table
on page 92. The majority of Awards are likely
to be made at or around the same time
each year as options are granted under the
AstraZeneca Share Option Plan. No payment
is required for the grant of Awards.
Performance period and vesting dates
In the case of the 2005 Award, the
performance target relates to the three-year
period commencing on 1 January 2005 and
the vesting date is 29 June 2008. For the
2006 Award, the performance target relates
to the three-year period commencing on 1
January 2006 and the vesting date is the third
anniversary of the date of grant.
Performance targets
For both Awards, the performance targets
are the Company' s T otal Shareholder Return
(TSR ) over the relevant three-year period
compared to the TSR of a selected peer
group of 12 other pharmaceutical companies
for the same period. These companies are:
Abbott Laboratories, Bristol-Myers Squibb,
Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson,
Merck, Novartis, Pfizer , Roche, Sanofi-Aventis,
Schering-Plough and Wyeth.
TSR looks at share price increase and
dividends re-invested in respect of a notional
number of shares, from the beginning of the
relevant performance period to the end of it,
and ranks the companies in the selected
comparator group by reference to the TSR
achieved over that period. The rank which
the Company' s TSR achieves over the
performance period will determine how
many Shares will vest under the relevant
Award, as per the vesting schedule shown
in the table below:
Vesting percentage of
TSR ranking of the Company Shares under Award
Below median 0%
Median 30%
Upper quartile 100%
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata
T o alleviate any short-term volatility, the return
index is averaged in the TSR calculations
for each company over the three months
prior to the start and end of the relevant
performance period.
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
86 ASTRAZENECA ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 20-F INFORMATION 2006 87 DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' SERVICE CONTRACTS
The service contracts of the current Executive
Directors provide for a notice period of one
year. For new Executive Directors, the Board
would aim to negotiate a one-year notice
period. In exceptional circumstances, the
initial notice period may be longer than one
year . In those circumstances, the Board would
explain to shareholders the reasons why it
believed a longer notice period was necessary
and it would be the Board' s intention that it
should be reduced to one year subsequently.
At the time of the AGM on 26 April 2007,
the unexpired term of Executive Directors'
service contracts will be a maximum of one
year. The details of the Executive Directors'
individual service contracts are set out in the
table above. If an Executive Director' s service
contract is terminated, the Company may,
depending upon the circumstances, be liable
to provide compensation to the Executive
Director equivalent to the salary and benefits
which he or she would have received during
the contractual notice period plus, in the case
of the Executive Director, Development, the
unreduced pension entitlement described
on page 85. For current Executive Directors,
it is the Company' s expectation that any such
liability would be calculated on the basis of one
year's base salary, target bonus and other
benefits. The Company' s policy in the event
of the termination of an Executive Director' s
service contract is to avoid any liability to the
Executive Director in excess of his or her
contractual entitlement and to aim to ensure
that any liability is mitigated to the fullest
extent possible.
POSITION OF THE NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
None of the Non-Executive Directors has
a service contract. They are not eligible for
performance-related bonuses or the grant of
share options. No pension contributions are
made on their behalf. The fees payable to
the Non-Executive Directors are set by a
committee of the Board comprising the
Executive Directors.
In addition to the TSR performance target
being met for each Award as set out above, the
Remuneration Committee also has to satisfy
itself that achievement of the TSR performance
target is a genuine reflection of the Company' s
underlying financial performance. 
The Remuneration Committee has the
discretion to award Shares up to a further
25% over and above the Shares subject to
the Award, if the Company' s TSR performance
is substantially better than that of the upper
quartile of the comparator group. 
The Remuneration Committee may vary or
waive these performance target(s) to take
account of events that lead the Remuneration
Committee, acting fairly and reasonably,
to believe the performance target(s) to be
no longer appropriate. Any variation to
the performance target(s) made by the
Remuneration Committee will not result in
the revised performance target(s) being, in
the opinion of the Remuneration Committee,
more difficult or easier to satisfy than the
initial performance target(s).
Individual limit
In respect of any financial year, the maximum
market value of Shares that may be put under
Award in respect of an employee is 500% of
that employee' s basic salary . This limit excludes
the above 25% maximum additional Shares
that may vest, at the sole discretion of the
Remuneration Committee, if the Company' s
TSR performance is substantially above that
of the upper quartile of the comparator group.
The actual individual limits that apply under
the Plan are set by the Remuneration
Committee from time to time.
Performance under the AstraZeneca
Performance Share Plan in 2006
The Peer Group Graphs  on page 90 show,
for each Award, how the Company' s TSR
performance has compared with the TSR
for the companies in the comparator group
from the first day of the relevant performance
period to 31 December 2006 and how the
Company ranks against those other companies
on this basis. We will continue to report on
the performance of each Award against the
relevant performance target during the
relevant vesting period.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS AND
RETENTION OF FEES

each case, Executive Directors may accept

  12 TRANSACTIONS WITH DIRECTORS
There were no material recorded transactions between the Company and the Directors during 2006 or 2005.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN GRAPHS
The UK Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the inclusion in the Directors' Remuneration Report of a graph showing total
shareholder return (TSR) over a five year period in respect of a holding of the Company' s shares, plotted against TSR in respect of a hypothetical
holding of shares of a similar kind and number by reference to which a broad equity market index is calculated. The Company is a member of the
FTSE 100 Index and consequently , for the purposes of this graph which is set out below, we have selected the FTSE 100 Index as the appropriate
index. This graph is re-based to 100 at the start of the rolling five-year period. We have also included a Pharma Peers Average , which reflects
the TSR of the same comparator group used for the Performance Share Plan graphs below.
The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan (the Plan ) referred to on pages 86 and 87 requires that the TSR in respect of a holding of the Company' s
shares over the relevant performance period be compared with the TSR of a peer group of 12 other pharmaceutical companies. The first graph
below shows how the Company' s TSR performance has compared with the TSR for the companies in the comparator group from 1 January 2005
(the first day of the current three-year performance period for the 2005 Award) to 31 December 2006 and how the Company ranks against those
other companies on this basis. The second graph below shows how the Company' s TSR performance has compared with the TSR for the
companies in the comparator group from 1 January 2006 (the first day of the current three-year performance period for the 2006 Award) to
3 1 December 2006 and how the Company ranks against those other companies on this basis.
T o alleviate any short-term volatility, the return index is averaged in the TSR calculations for each company over the three months prior to
the start of the relevant performance period (as stipulated in the Plan) and, for the purposes of the above interim snapshots, over the last
three months of 2006.

Unitised stock plans
David Brennan, in common with other participating executives in the US, has interests in the following: the AstraZeneca Executive Deferral Plan,
the AstraZeneca Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and the AstraZeneca Savings and Security Plan. These are unitised stock plans and
participants hold units in each plan. A unit comprises part cash and part ADSs. The overall unit price is determined daily by taking the market
value of the underlying ADSs and adding the cash position. The ADSs held within these units carry both voting and dividend rights. Mr Brennan
is deemed to have a notional interest in these ADSs, calculated by reference to the fund value and the closing price of ADSs. As the value of the
unit varies, the number of ADSs attached to each unit varies. Therefore, the number of ADSs held within each unit varies daily.
