 REMUNERATION REPORT
98 ASTRAZENECA ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 20-F INFORMATION 2007
At the request of the Remuneration Committee, 
the Chief Executive Officer and certain senior 
managers were invited to attend meetings 
of the Remuneration Committee throughout 
the year. Accordingly, the following attended 
meetings of the Remuneration Committee in 
2007, except where their own remuneration 
was being discussed: David Brennan (Chief 
Executive Officer); Tony Bloxham (formerly 
Executive Vice-President, Human Resources) 
and, following his retirement, Lynn Tetrault 
(Executive Vice-President, Human Resources 
and Corporate Affairs); Peter Brown (formerly 
Vice-President, Global Compensation 
and Benefits) and, following his retirement, 
Simon Appleby (Vice President, Performance 
and Reward); and (prior to his becoming a 
Remuneration Committee member and 
when the business of the meeting was better 
served by his attendance) Louis Schweitzer. 
These individuals provided advice and services 
that materially assisted the Remuneration 
Committee during the year. In so doing, 
Mr Brown (and following his retirement, 
Mr Appleby) drew on various sources of 
data concerning directors' and executives' 
salaries, bonus levels and other incentives 
including general pharmaceutical industry 
reports and surveys, as well as surveys 
specifically carried out for the Company, 
such as those prepared by Towers Perrin. 
During 2007, Carol Arrowsmith of Deloitte & 
Touche LLP (Deloitte) was appointed by 
the Remuneration Committee to provide it 
with independent advice on all matters being 
considered by it. Deloitte also provided 
taxation advice and other non-audit services 
to the Company. 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REMIT 
AND KEY ACTIVITIES DURING THE YEAR
Remit
During 2007, the Remuneration Committee 
undertook a review of its own remit. This led 
to a proposal to adopt a revised remit, building 
on the model remit prepared by the Institute 
of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators 
(ICSA), which was subsequently approved 
by the Board. This revised remit reflects 
AstraZeneca's commitment to operate in 
a way which is consistent with the highest 
standards of corporate governance.
The revised Remuneration Committee remit 
covers, amongst other things:
The requirement that the Remuneration  >
Committee takes into account all factors 
which it deems necessary in order to 
achieve a competitive and fair remuneration 
structure which operates in the interests 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
MEMBERSHIP AND MEETINGS
The members of the Remuneration Committee 
are John Varley (who became the Chairman 
of the Committee on 26 April 2007), 
John Buchanan, Louis Schweitzer (since 
12 September 2007) and Nancy Rothwell 
(since 26 April 2007). They are all Non-
Executive Directors. The Board considers 
them all to be independent with the exception 
of Louis Schweitzer who was considered 
independent upon his appointment as 
Chairman of the Board. (The independence 
of the Non-Executive Directors is discussed 
in more detail in the Directors' Report on page 
43). During 2007, three members resigned 
from the Remuneration Committee because 
they retired or resigned from the Board, 
namely Peter Bonfield (following his retirement 
from the Board on 26 April 2007), Erna M ller 
(following her retirement from the Board on 
26 April 2007) and Joe Jimenez (following 
his resignation from the Board on 12 April 
2007). The Company Secretary acts as the 
secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee met six times 
in 2007. Each meeting was attended by all of 
its members, except that other commitments 
prevented John Varley (prior to his appointment 
as Chairman of the Committee) and John 
Buchanan from each attending one meeting. 
Nancy Rothwell and Louis Schweitzer 
joined the Committee on 26 April 2007 and 
12 September 2007 respectively and have 
attended all meetings from these dates, 
except that both Nancy Rothwell and Louis 
Schweitzer were unable to attend the meeting 
on 3 December 2007 as this was set up with 
short notice as it was an urgent meeting.
This Directors' Remuneration Report has been 
prepared in accordance with the Directors' 
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 
(the Regulations) and meets the relevant 
requirements of the Financial Services 
Authority's (FSA) Listing Rules. As required by 
the Regulations, a resolution to approve the 
report will be proposed at the Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) on Thursday 24 April 2008.
The following sections of the Directors' 
Remuneration Report up to and including 
the section titled  Non-Executive Directors' 
page 105 were not subject to audit by 
KPMG Audit Plc.
the Board. Our objective is to ensure that 
our compensation policies and practices 
support the generation of growth, and 
facilitate thereby the generation of value 
for shareholders. Meeting those objectives 
dominated our agenda during 2007. 
This included creating the appropriate 
compensation structures for the new 
MedImmune business.

Key activities during the year
The Remuneration Committee considered 
the following matters, amongst other things, 
during 2007:
The terms of senior executive packages  >
on appointment and termination.
The remuneration principles relating to the  >
newly enlarged biologics business operating 
under the MedImmune name, in order to 
ensure that the dynamic and entrepreneurial 
ethos of a biotechnology company is 
maintained, whilst ensuring that there 
is proper alignment with the strategic 
objectives of the Group as a whole to 
deliver shareholder value.
As described above, a review of its own  >
remit and the development of a revised 
remit which has been adopted by the Board.
ASTRAZENECA'S OVERALL REMUNERATION 
POLICY AND PURPOSE
The Board is committed to maintaining a 
dynamic performance culture, in which the 
Group can compete strongly by employing 
and developing the best talent and where 
every employee is clear about the Company's 
objectives, how their work will impact on 
those objectives and how they will benefit 
from achieving high levels of performance. 
To underpin these objectives, in addition to 
fixed remuneration (basic pay, pension and 
certain other benefits) benchmarked against 
appropriate external comparators, the majority 
of employees are eligible to receive an annual 
cash incentive, with a component based on 
corporate financial performance in the form 
of earnings per share (EPS) and/or individual 
performance. Whilst details of bonus plans 
differ from country to country, the EPS 
component ensures that all eligible employees 
receive an element of reward based on the 
Company's overall financial performance. 
In addition, long-term incentive awards are 
provided to selected employees in order 
to align their interests closely with those of 
the shareholders.
These pay-for-performance principles apply 
throughout the Group, and provide a consistent 
framework within which executive remuneration 
decisions are made. The Remuneration 
Committee seeks to ensure that the overall 
proportion of variable pay (bonuses and 
share-based awards) to which Directors and 
members of the Senior Executive Team (SET) 
may become entitled makes up a significant 
proportion of their overall remuneration 
package. The Remuneration Committee's 
objective is to ensure that such variable pay 
is linked to a range of measures designed to 
promote both individual and team behaviour 
and performance that genuinely contributes 
to the success of AstraZeneca and which 
ultimately creates value for shareholders. 
Such measures are designed to be stretching 
and challenging.
Consistent with its approach during the year, 
the Board has confirmed that the Company's 
overall remuneration policy and purpose going 
forward will continue to be to:
Attract and retain people of the quality  >
necessary to sustain the Company as 
one of the best pharmaceutical companies 
in the world.
Motivate these people in order to achieve  >
the level of performance necessary to create 
sustained growth in shareholder value.
In order to achieve this, the remuneration 
policy and practice are designed to:
Closely align individual and team reward  >
with business performance at each level.
Encourage employees to perform to their  >
fullest capacity.
Encourage employees to align their  >
interests with those of shareholders.
Support managers' responsibility to  >
achieve improvements in business 
performance through people and to 
recognise superior performance, in the 
short and longer term.
Be internally consistent, as far as practicable  >
and beneficial, but taking due account of 
local market needs and permitting flexibility 
where this is beneficial.
Be competitive and cost-effective in each  >
of the relevant employment markets.
The cost and value of the components of 
the remuneration package are considered 
as a whole and are designed to:
Ensure a proper balance of fixed pay and  >
variable performance-related pay (linked 
to short- and long-term objectives).
Reflect market competitiveness. >
During 2008, the Remuneration Committee 
intends to review the current remuneration 
policy for members of the SET with a view to 
benchmarking reward against the companies 
and markets with which AstraZeneca should 
of shareholders and to the benefit of 
the financial and commercial health of 
the Company.
The constitution of the Remuneration  >
Committee, including membership criteria 
and the process for the appointment of 
independent Non-Executive Directors to 
the Remuneration Committee.
The operation of the Remuneration  >
Committee, by ensuring compliance to the 
fullest extent appropriate and practicable 
with the best practice principles contained 
within the UK Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance (annexed to the 
FSA's Listing Rules).
The remuneration policy of the Group. This  >
includes the Remuneration Committee's 
responsibility, after appropriate consultation 
with the Chairman and the Chief Executive 
Officer, to make recommendations to the 
Board in respect of the Company's policy 
for Executive Director and senior executive 
remuneration; to make decisions, on an 
individual basis, regarding each element 
of remuneration, including the terms 
and conditions of employment and the 
retirement/severance provisions for 
the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman, 
the Chief Executive Officer, the Executive 
Directors, the Company Secretary and 
those within the wider senior executive 
population that fall within the Remuneration 
Committee's remit.
  In formulating its proposals, the 
Remuneration Committee seeks to 
provide key executives every 
encouragement to enhance the 
Company's performance and to ensure 
that individuals are fairly, but responsibly, 
rewarded for their contribution to the 
creation of shareholder value.

Illustration of fixed and 
variable remuneration
Based on our remuneration policy, the charts 
at the top of page 101 illustrate the potential 
weighting given to fixed and variable 
elements of the remuneration package at 
Executive Director level. Performance-related 
elements of the package are shown on an 
 Expected Value' basis, and in the event that 
performance conditions are not met, such 
elements would not deliver any value. The 
Expected Value approach considers the 
range of possible outcomes and the 
probability attached to each, in order to 
provide a value that represents the average 
that would be delivered if the arrangements 
were operated over many years. The 
Expected Value for bonus payment is taken 
to be the target payout level.
Fixed remuneration
Basic salary
The basic salary for each Executive Director 
and SET member is determined by the 
Remuneration Committee. The Company's 
policy is currently to set Executive Directors' 
base salary levels by reference to practice 
across the UK FTSE 30. Other SET members 
are benchmarked against comparable jobs 
in the countries in which they normally 
work (primarily referenced against industry 
comparators or companies with levels of 
global operation and complexity similar to 
those of AstraZeneca). 
Salary decisions reflect the experience and 
sustained performance of the individuals to 
whom they apply, taking account of market 
competitiveness and the level of increases 
applicable to employees in the wider Group. 
For the Executive Directors and other members 
of the SET, the policy has been to position 
salaries at or slightly above the median of the 
relevant market.
Short-term bonus - a lump-sum payment  >
related to the targeted achievement of 
corporate, functional and individual goals, 
measured over a year and contained 
within a specific plan. The corporate goals 
are derived from the annual financial targets 
set by the Board and take into account 
external expectations of performance. 
The functional goals are agreed by the 
Remuneration Committee at the start of, 
and are monitored throughout, the year. 
Bonuses are not pensionable. Individual 
goals are based on annual objectives 
which are linked to functional goals.
Long-term incentive plans - for selected  >
groups, targeted at the achievement of 
strategic objectives closely aligned with 
the interests of shareholders, namely 
the AstraZeneca Performance Share 
Plan (PSP) described on pages 103 to 
104, the AstraZeneca Share Option Plan 
described on pages 104 to 105 and in line 
with market practice. Some individuals 
(primarily those based in the US, but 
excluding Executive Directors), participate 
in the Restricted Stock Unit Plan(s) 
described on page 105.
Share participation - various plans provide  >
the opportunity for employees to take 
a personal stake in the Company's 
wealth creation as shareholders. These 
plans are described in Note 26 to the 
Financial Statements.
The way in which these elements of 
remuneration were combined and applied 
varies according to a range of factors including 
specific business needs and practices in 
different geographic markets, although, in 
general, the more senior the role within the 
business, the greater the proportion of total 
remuneration was made up from variable pay.
appropriately reference competitive levels of 
reward. This is partly the consequence of the 
changing composition of the senior leadership 
group, which has become increasingly 
international and partly because we have 
added significant capability in our pursuit of 
growth (the best example being the biologics 
businesses which we have acquired over 
the last two years). In seeking to attract, 
develop and retain the best human capital 
in the industry, we must remain very attentive 
to the wider industry practice and the impact 
of the international pay environment.
We expect to report to our shareholders 
the key findings, and any changes to the 
remuneration policy as a consequence of 
this review, in next year's Annual Report and 
Form 20-F Information.
COMPONENTS OF REMUNERATION
During 2007, the components of employee 
remuneration (including that of the Executive 
Directors and SET members) comprised of 
fixed and variable (ie performance-related) 
elements, as illustrated below.
Throughout 2007, as in 2006, the principal 
components of the total remuneration 
package comprised:
Annual salary - based on conditions in  >
the relevant geographic market and the 
value of an individual's sustained personal 
performance to the business, resulting 
from their ability and experience.
Pension arrangements - appropriate to  >
the relevant national market.
Benefits (such as healthcare) - cost- >
effective and compatible with relevant 
welfare arrangements.

All Executive Directors' terms and conditions 
are UK-based, apart from David Brennan's 
pension (including health insurance) 
arrangements, which are described below. 
For 2008, the Executive Directors' revised 
annual salaries are shown in the table at the 
top of this page.
Pension arrangements
The table on page 108 gives details of the 
changes in the value of the Executive 
Directors' accrued pensions during 2007.
US Executive Directors' 
pension arrangements
David Brennan is a member of the AstraZeneca 
US Defined Benefit Pension Plan, by virtue of 
his membership of pension plans applicable 
to legacy Astra Merck employees. Benefits for 
members of this plan are delivered on a tax- 
qualified basis, with accrued benefits that 
exceed specific limits under the plan's formula 
and the US Tax Code being delivered through 
a supplementary, non-qualified plan. The 
normal pension age under both plans is 65.
In September 2008, David Brennan will satisfy 
a condition in the plan relating to combined 
age and service exceeding 85 years, which is 
a condition that applies to all members within 
the plan. Thereafter, on leaving or retiring from 
employment, he would be eligible to take 
a pension or lump sum equivalent based on 
accrued service and final pensionable pay 
(ie, without actuarial reduction). This change 
in status under the plan will trigger an increase 
in transfer value during 2008.
David Brennan's participation in the pension 
plan is subject to a service cap at 35 years' 
service, which will be attained in January 
2011, after which no further service accrual 
can be earned. 
Members and, in the event of death, 
surviving spouses/dependants can elect 
to take pensions in lump-sum form based 
on actuarial valuation.
In addition, David Brennan is a contributing 
member of the US 401(k) savings plan
2
, 
as applies to all US employees. For 2008, 
David Brennan, along with all eligible US 
employees, will receive an up-lift to the 
contributions paid into the 401(k) and 
associated non-qualified saving plans.
UK Executive Directors' 
pension arrangements 
UK Executive Directors have the option to 
participate in the UK Pension Fund according 
to their eligibility, or to take a cash allowance 
in lieu of pension. The cash allowance is 
consistent with the appropriate cost of the 
alternative gross pension benefit.
John Patterson (Executive Director, 
Development) has elected to remain 
a member of the AstraZeneca Group's 
main UK Defined Benefit Pension Plan for 
the option year 2007/2008 rather than take 
the cash allowance. The normal pension age 
under this plan is 62. However, a member's 
accrued pension is available from age 60 
without any actuarial reduction. In addition, 
the accrued pension is available, unreduced, 
from age 57 if the Group consents to a request 
for early retirement and from age 50 if the 
retirement is at the Group's request. John 
Patterson reached age 60 in January 2008 
and hereafter, on leaving or retiring from the 
Group, will be eligible to take a pension based 
on accrued service and final pensionable pay.
On death in retirement, the accrued pension 
is guaranteed payable for the first five years 
of retirement and then reduces to two-thirds 
of this amount should there be a surviving 
spouse or other dependant. Any member 
may choose higher or lower levels of 
survivor's pensions at retirement, subject 
to HM Revenue & Customs limits, in return 
for an adjustment to their own pension of 
equivalent actuarial value. Pensions are also 
payable to dependent children.
Pensions in payment are increased annually 
in line with inflation, as measured by the UK 
Retail Prices Index, up to a maximum of 5%.
Simon Lowth (the Chief Financial Officer) 
is eligible to join the Group's main defined 
contribution plan at a Group contribution rate 
of 24% of annual basic salary, or alternatively, 
to take the Group contribution as a cash 
allowance. For the option year 2007/2008, 
he has elected to take the cash allowance 
(as detailed beneath the pensions table on 
page 108).
Jonathan Symonds (the former Chief 
Financial Officer) benefited from a pension 
promise equivalent to membership of the 
UK Defined Benefit Pension Plan. This was 
delivered in 2007 through a combination of 
an annual payment by the Company of 26% 
of base salary paid into a personal pension, 
and an unfunded top-up benefit to deliver the 
balance. The aggregate benefits are shown 
in the table on page 108 as if the scheme 
were a defined benefit arrangement. 
Following Jonathan Symonds' resignation 
in July 2007, his pension arrangements were 
terminated in accordance with pre-existing 
rights under the governing documentation. 
Accordingly, the Company exercised its power 
to wind up the pension arrangement and pay 
out the accrued capital value of the unfunded 
top-up benefit. In so doing, the Committee 
took external independent actuarial advice 
as to what would be a reasonable valuation, 
resulting in a cash lump sum payment of 
 3.27 million being made.
The payment extinguishes all pension 
liabilities the Company has in respect of 
Jonathan Symonds.

Consistent with best practice, the Remuneration 
Committee has put in place a requirement 
that a certain proportion of any short-term 
bonus payment should be deferred and 
invested into Ordinary Shares (or ADSs) in 
the Company acquired on the open market 
at the prevailing market price and held on 
behalf of the individual Executive Director by 
the Company for a period of three years from 
the date of acquisition. This arrangement is 
intended as one of the ways in which, over 
time, Executive Directors will be able to build 
up a significant shareholding in the business. 
Although the delivery of these shares to the 
individual after three years is not contingent 
on the continued performance of the business, 
the Remuneration Committee has reserved the 
right to retrospectively alter bonus outcomes 
in circumstances where it does not consider 
that the delivery of shares is warranted by 
the underlying performance of the business. 
The proportion currently deferred into shares 
is one third of the pre-tax bonus for Executive 
Directors and one sixth for all other SET 
members. On leaving, participants would 
normally have to wait for the shares to be 
released at the end of the three year period. 
For 2007, the short-term bonuses awarded 
to the Executive Directors are set out on 
page 103.
Bonus outcomes for 2007
The bonus outcomes for 2007 are shown in 
the table at the top of page 103. Bonuses are 
not pensionable.
For 2008, the bonus ranges for each Executive 
Director are shown on page 103 and are the 
same as for 2007.
Long-term incentive plans
Executive Directors and members of the SET 
may also be granted share options under 
the AstraZeneca Share Option Plan and 
awards under the AstraZeneca Performance 
Share Plan. The grant of such options and 
award of such shares are determined by 
the Remuneration Committee, as are the 
performance targets that apply to their vesting 
and/or exercise. Both of these schemes are 
individual in his or her role. Further discussion 
of the weighting of each of these factors 
is set out under the heading  Structure and 
Assessment of Performance' below.
In respect of the assessment of bonuses 
for 2007, EPS (excluding restructuring and 
synergy costs) increased by 7%; global sales 
increased by 7% overall; and operating profit 
(excluding restructuring and synergy costs) 
increased by 8%. The development pipeline 
was strengthened and now comprises 95 
clinical projects. The size of the phase III 
portfolio doubled from five to 10 projects 
(covering nine new compounds). It was a 
record year in terms of the number of new 
molecules entering phase I compared with 
2006 (24 in 2007, 12 in 2006). During 2007, 
there were significant externalisation 
developments, including the acquisition of 
MedImmune, Inc. which is described in detail 
on page 25. Good progress was made in 
product development life cycle management. 
These achievements were underpinned by 
a continuing emphasis on cost discipline, 
improved productivity and performance 
management. During 2007, the Business 
Performance Management framework was 
reviewed, with a view to further enhancing 
focus on AstraZeneca's strategic objectives. 
Bonus outcomes for 2007 reflected overall 
corporate and relevant functional performance 
in 2007 against clear objectives in relation 
to the following categories:
Performance (financial and operational). >
Patients. >
Products. >
People. >
Bonus outcomes for 2008 will reflect overall 
corporate financial and relevant functional 
performance against clear objectives in 
relation to the following categories which are 
consistent with delivering shareholder value:
Strengthening the pipeline. >
Growing the business. >
Reshaping the business. >
Promoting a culture of responsibility  >
and accountability.
More information about these objectives is 
set out in the section Goals, Strategy and 
Performance Measurement on pages 9 to 12.
Structure and assessment of performance
Since consultation with shareholders in 2004, 
the performance criteria for determining the 
annual bonus for Executive Directors (and 
other SET members) have been as follows:
In the event of a senior employee in the main 
UK Defined Benefit Pension Plan becoming 
incapacitated, then a pension is payable 
immediately as if such person had reached 
normal retirement age (subject to a maximum 
of 10 years' additional service), based on 
current pensionable salary. In the event 
of a member's death prior to retirement, 
dependants are entitled to a pension of 
two-thirds of the pension that would have 
been earned had the deceased remained in 
service to age 62, plus a capital sum of four 
times pensionable pay.
In the event of a senior employee in the 
main UK Defined Contribution Pension Plan 
(or where an alternative cash allowance has 
been taken) becoming incapacitated, then 
Permanent Health Insurance provides 
continuation of a proportion of salary subject 
to satisfying medical criteria. In the event of 
death prior to retirement, dependants are 
entitled to a pension and/or lump sum 
secured from a multiple of ten times salary.
Benefits
In conjunction with the majority of employers, 
certain benefits are made available to the 
Executive Directors and members of the 
SET via a flexible benefits programme offered 
by AstraZeneca. Under this programme, 
participants may elect to purchase certain 
benefits such as funding to facilitate the 
purchase of a company car and additional 
insurance from a fund calculated by reference 
to basic salary. 
Variable remuneration
Executive Directors and members of the 
SET are eligible to participate in a number of 
different elements of variable pay, which are 
described below. The decision as to whether 
or not in any given year the Executive Directors 
and members of the SET receive any or all of 
their elements of variable pay is determined 
by the Remuneration Committee, who will 
typically have regard to the performance of 
the individual and will consider the elements 
of variable pay applicable to senior employees 
in other comparable organisations in making 
such a determination.
Short-term bonus
Performance criteria 
All Executive Directors and members of the 
SET are eligible for a short-term bonus. 
The basis for the payment of any short-term 
bonus is determined by reference to a range

Performance targets
For all Awards so far, the performance target 
is the Company' s total shareholder return (TSR) 
over the relevant three-year period compared 
with the TSR of a selected peer group of 
pharmaceutical companies for the same 
period. These companies are currently a total 
of 12: Abbott Laboratories, Bristol-Myers 
Squibb, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & 
Johnson, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, 
Sanofi-Aventis, Schering-Plough and Wyeth.
TSR looks at share price increase and 
dividends re-invested in respect of a notional 
number of shares, from the beginning of the 
relevant performance period to the end of 
it, and ranks the companies in the selected 
comparator group by reference to their TSR 
achieved over that period. The rank which 
the Company's TSR achieves over the 
performance period will determine how 
many Shares will vest under the relevant 
Award, as per the vesting schedule shown 
in the table below:
TSR ranking  Vesting percentage of
of the Company Shares under Award %
Below median 0
Median 30
Upper quartile 100
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata
Significantly above upper quartile up to 125
To alleviate any short-term volatility, the return 
index is averaged in the TSR calculations 
for each company over the three months 
prior to the start and end of the relevant 
performance period.
In addition to the TSR performance target 
being met for each Award as set out above, 
the Remuneration Committee also has to 
satisfy itself that achievement of the TSR 
performance target is a genuine reflection 
of the Company's underlying financial 
performance and has the discretion to not 
allow Awards to vest or to only allow them 
to partially vest where this appears to the 
Remuneration Committee to be warranted. 
The Remuneration Committee has the 
discretion to award Shares up to a further 
25% over and above the Shares subject to 
the Award, if the Company' s TSR performance 
is substantially better than that of the upper 
quartile of the comparator group. 
Generally, Awards can be granted at any 
time (although in practice they are awarded 
annually), but not during a close period of the 
Company. In 2007, the main grant of Awards 
was made on 30 March, with other awards 
approved by the Remuneration Committee 
in relation to, for example new appointments 
or promotions granted on 24 August and 
16 November. The value of the shares subject 
to the Award is determined by reference to 
the market price of Shares over the three-
day period immediately preceding the date 
of grant.
Details of Awards to Executive Directors are 
shown in the table on page 111.
Performance conditions
Save in exceptional circumstances, which 
are prescribed in the PSP rules, the vesting 
of Awards is contingent on the satisfaction of 
specified performance targets and continued 
employment with the Group. In addition to 
the  satisfaction of these performance targets, 
Awards will generally not vest until the third 
anniversary of the date of grant although 
Awards may vest in part on a time pro-rated 
basis where a participant ceases to be 
in relevant employment under certain 
circumstances during the vesting period 
to the extent that the performance targets 
have been met.
Performance period and vesting dates
In the case of all Awards granted so far, the 
performance target relates to the three-year 
period commencing on 1 January of the year 
of grant. Thus, for the Awards made in 2007, 
the performance period runs from 1 January 
2007 to 31 December 2009. The vesting date 
is the third anniversary of the date of grant. 
intended to align the interests of Executive 
Directors and members of the SET with those 
of shareholders. Following the exercise of an 
option under the AstraZeneca Share Option 
Plan it is the expectation of the Remuneration 
Committee that the Executive Directors will 
retain the net number of shares from the 
exercise for a period of not less than six 
months from the date of exercise.
Shareholding guidelines
For the Executive Directors and members of 
the SET, the Remuneration Committee has 
established target shareholding guidelines in 
which it is expected that Executive Directors 
build up their own holding of shares in the 
Company, equivalent to one times their basic 
salary. It is expected that these shareholding 
targets will be reached in part through shares 
delivered from the various long-term incentive 
arrangements as well as the deferred part of 
the short-term bonus (described above).
AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan 
The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan 
(PSP) was approved by shareholders at the 
AGM in 2005 and provides for the grant of 
performance share awards (Awards) over 
Ordinary Shares or American Depositary Shares 
in AstraZeneca PLC (together, the Shares). 
Basis of participation
The Remuneration Committee is responsible 
for setting the policy for the way in which the 
PSP should be operated, including agreeing 
performance targets, identifying which 
employees should be invited to participate in 
the PSP and the level of Awards. Participation 
is highly selective and tends to only include 
senior employees on the basis of their 
performance. Awards are not pensionable and 
may not generally be assigned or transferred.

to the new science of biopharmaceuticals, 
in 2006 AstraZeneca acquired Cambridge 
Antibody Technology Group.
As well as taking into account these 
performance considerations at the point 
of granting Awards, the Remuneration 
Committee imposed performance conditions 
in respect of the exercise of such Awards 
in respect of members of the SET (including 
the Executive Directors) which, in the view of 
the Remuneration Committee were considered 
appropriately stretching. In order for Awards 
to vest, the EPS of the Group must increase 
at least in line with the UK Retail Price Index 
plus 5% per annum on average, over a three 
year period, the base figure being the EPS for 
the financial year preceding the date of grant, 
with no re-testing. In addition, since the 
review of executive remuneration in 2004, 
the Remuneration Committee has included 
a condition to the effect that, if an event occurs 
which causes material reputational damage 
to the Company, such that it is not appropriate 
for the Awards to vest and become 
exercisable, the Remuneration Committee 
can make a determination to that effect.
The Remuneration Committee also sought 
and received assurances that each individual 
proposed for the grant of an Award has been 
performing in a manner that justified a grant 
to them. There was some variation in the level 
of grants being proposed between individuals, 
to reflect differing levels of performance and 
their seniority within the business.
Change in control provisions
On a change in control of the Company 
as a result of a general offer to acquire the 
whole of the issued ordinary share capital 
of the Company, any unvested Awards vest 
immediately following the change in control. 
All outstanding vested Awards can be 
exercised during the period of six months 
from the date of the change in control. 
The Company will use its best endeavours 
to ensure that any shares acquired from an 
exercise following a change in control are 
subject to the same terms as shares of the 
same class were acquired under the general 
offer. Unexercised Awards will lapse at the end 
of the six-month period following a change in 
control or, if the Award is exchanged for an 
option relating to shares in a different company, 
the date of exchange, whichever is earlier.
Dilution
The dilutive effect of the proposed grants 
of Awards on the Company's issued 
share capital was also considered by the 
Remuneration Committee, in accordance 
performance targets and identifying which 
employees should be invited to participate 
and the level of Awards. Participation is highly 
selective and tends to only include senior 
employees on the basis of their performance 
(except in the US where for cultural reasons, 
participation in the SOP is more widespread). 
Awards are not pensionable and may not 
generally be assigned or transferred.
Generally, Awards can be granted at any time, 
but not during a close period of the Company. 
In 2007, grants of Awards were made on 
30 March, 24 August and 16 November. 
The exercise price is fixed by reference to the 
market price of Shares over the three day 
period immediately preceding the date of grant.
Details of Awards to Executive Directors are 
shown in the table on page 113.
Performance conditions
The Remuneration Committee must, before 
agreeing to grant an Award to Executive 
Directors and others, be satisfied that both the 
most recent and the underlying performance 
of the business justify each grant and that 
each individual to whom an Award is 
proposed to be granted has achieved a level 
of performance in his or her role considered 
by the Remuneration Committee as being 
able to justify in the interests of the business, 
the grant of such an Award.
In agreeing grants of Awards in March 
2007, the Remuneration Committee took 
into account strong underlying financial 
performance and progress towards achieving 
longer-term goals. In particular, in coming 
to its view, it noted that during 2006: sales 
increased by 11% to $26.5 billion and 
operating profits increased by 28% to 
$8.2 billion on a constant exchange rate basis; 
earnings per share, at $3.36 (excluding 
Toprol), were 34.4% higher and dividends, 
at $1.72, 32% higher than in 2005; and 
costs were managed in a disciplined way. 
In addition, in 2006, the Company had 
announced a programme to rationalise 
production assets and to reduce headcount. 
Investment in R&D grew by 16% in 2006, 
to $3.9 billion; there were 120 development 
projects; 49 in pre-clinical, 23 in clinical 
phase I, 20 in phase II, and 28 in phase III; 
five new chemical entities were in late stage 
development; 11 applications were made to 
regulatory authorities for new indications for 
existing products; for example to the FDA for 
Seroquel in bipolar depression; 10 of these 
were approved; and 325 further R&D 
collaborations with outside agencies were 
agreed. In order to both supplement the 
short-term pipeline and to accelerate access 
Individual limit
In respect of any financial year, the maximum 
market value of Shares that may be put under 
Award in respect of an employee is 500% of 
that employee' s basic salary. This limit excludes 
the above 25% maximum additional Shares 
that may vest, at the sole discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee, if the Company's 
TSR performance is substantially above that 
of the upper quartile of the comparator group. 
For Awards to vest at this level, the Company 
would need to have sustained a level of 
performance well in excess of upper quartile 
over a period of years and the Remuneration 
Committee would need to be satisfied that 
this was warranted.
The actual individual limits that apply under the 
PSP , subject to this maximum, are set by the 
Remuneration Committee from time to time.
Performance under the AstraZeneca 
Performance Share Plan in 2007
The Peer Group Graphs on page 109 show, 
for each Award, how the Company's TSR 
performance has compared with the TSR 
for the companies in the comparator group 
from the first day of the relevant performance 
period to 31 December 2007 and how the 
Company ranks against those other peer 
companies on this basis. We will continue 
to report on the performance of each Award 
against the relevant performance target during 
the relevant vesting period.
Change in control provisions
On a change in control of the Company as 
a result of a general offer to acquire the whole 
of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company, Awards will vest pro-rata to the 
time elapsed between the date of grant of the 
Award and the date of the change in control 
to the extent that the relevant performance 
targets have been met up to the date of the 
change in control (or the most practicable 
earlier date). The Remuneration Committee 
will, however, have discretion to take into 
account any other factors it believes to be 
relevant in determining the extent to which 
Awards will vest in these circumstances.
AstraZeneca Share Option Plan
The AstraZeneca Share Option Plan (SOP) 
was approved by shareholders at the AGM 
in 2000 and provides for the grant of share 
option awards (Awards) over Ordinary 
Shares or American Depositary Shares in 
AstraZeneca PLC (together, the Shares).
Basis of participation
The Remuneration Committee is responsible 
for setting the policy for the way in which the 
SOP should be operated, including agreeing  REMUNERATION REPORT

Policy on external appointments 
and retention of fees
Subject to the specific approval of the 
Board in each case, Executive Directors and 
members of the SET may accept external 
appointments as non-executive directors of 
other companies and retain any related fees 
paid to them provided always that such 
external appointments are not considered 
by the Board to prevent or reduce the ability 
of the executive to perform his or her role to 
the required standard. Such appointments 
are seen as a way in which executives can 
gain a broader business experience and, 
in turn, benefit the Company.
In respect of any external appointments held 
by Executive Directors and in relation to the 
retention of any such fees, John Patterson 
is a non-executive director of Cobham plc. In 
respect of such position, he retained the fees 
paid to him for his services which, in 2007, 
totalled  51,500.
Non-Executive Directors
None of the Non-Executive Directors has 
a service contract. They are not eligible for 
performance-related bonuses or the grant 
of share options. No pension contributions 
are made on their behalf. None of the Non-
Executive Directors have participated or will 
participate in any decision made by the Board 
in relation to the determination of their fees.
The remainder of this report was subject to 
audit by KPMG Audit Plc.
AUDIT
The Directors' emoluments in 2007 and 
the details of the Directors' interests in the 
Company's Ordinary Shares disclosed in the 
Directors' Emoluments section on pages 106 
to 114 have been audited by the Company's 
external auditor.
Service contracts
Details of the service contracts for each of 
the Executive Directors, including their notice 
periods, are set out in the table below. 
The notice periods in the Executive Directors' 
service contracts are 12 months, but in the 
case of Simon Lowth his 12 month notice may 
not expire prior to the second anniversary 
of his employment commencing. To recruit 
Simon Lowth it was necessary to offer him 
an initial one year period before the 12 month 
notice could be served. It is the Board's 
intention that all Executive Directors should 
have notice periods that do not exceed 
12 months. Where it is necessary to offer 
longer notice periods to new directors it is 
the Board's intention that the notice period 
should reduce to a maximum of 12 months 
after the initial period, such as in Simon 
Lowth's case. 
It is the Board's intention that, in the event 
of early termination of an Executive Director's 
employment, any compensation payable 
under the service contract should not exceed 
the salary and benefits that would have been 
received had the contractual notice period 
been worked and this may be further reduced 
in line with the Executive Director's duty to 
mitigate losses. Compensation for any bonus 
entitlement will be assessed initially as  on 
target' but subject to adjustment by the 
Remuneration Committee to take account of 
the particular circumstances of the termination. 
In addition, in the case of the Executive 
Director Development only, the unreduced 
pension entitlement described under the 
Pensions section on page 108 would be 
payable. In the case of Simon Lowth only, 
his service contract provides that, in the 
event of termination during the first 12 months 
of his employment, his entitlement to 
compensation payable for the balance of 
the initial 12 month period in which he has 
not worked will be less than any salary and 
benefits to which he would have been 
entitled had he worked during that period.
with its commitment, reflecting the ABI's 
guidance, that the percentage of the issued 
share capital that could be allocated under 
all of the Company's employee share plans 
over a period of 10 years should be under 
10%. This commitment is applied by the 
Remuneration Committee in practice as a 
limit, on average, of under 1% per annum. 
The Remuneration Committee concluded that 
a grant of Awards to those plan participants 
and individual Executive Directors proposed 
for a grant was appropriate given the level 
of performance achieved. None of the other 
long-term incentive plans currently operated 
by the Company have a dilutive effect because 
they do not involve the issue and allotment 
of new Shares or ADSs in the Company but 
rather rely on the market purchase of Shares 
or ADSs that have already been issued.
Zeneca 1994 Executive Share 
Option Scheme
This plan was replaced by the AstraZeneca 
Share Option Plan. The last grant of options 
under this plan was in March 2000. Certain 
Executive Directors and members of the SET 
have options outstanding under this plan, 
all of which are exercisable, the performance 
conditions having been satisfied. A description 
of this plan can be found on page 156.
Other plans
In addition to the plans described above, 
the Company operates a Share Incentive 
Plan and a Savings-Related Share Option 
Plan, both of which are UK HM Revenue & 
Customs approved plans. Certain Executive 
Directors and members of the SET are 
eligible to participate in these plans, more 
detailed descriptions of which can be found 
on pages 154 and 156.
Restricted Stock Unit Plans
The AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP 
Restricted Stock Unit Award Plan (RSU Plan) 
was introduced in 2007 and provides for the 
grant of restricted stock unit awards (Awards) 
to selected employees (predominantly in the 
US). The RSU Plan is used in conjunction with 
the AstraZeneca Share Option Plan to provide 
a mix of restricted stock units and share 
options. Awards typically vest on the third 
anniversary of the date of grant and are 
contingent on continued employment with 
AstraZeneca. In 2007, Awards were made 
on 30 March and 24 August. In addition, 
the RSU Plan has also been used in 2007 
to make Awards to certain employees 
within the MedImmune part of the Group 
as previously described.

Notes
For John Patterson and Jonathan Symonds, transfer values are calculated on the market related basis used by the AstraZeneca UK Pension  >
Plan, in line with the GN11 guidance note published by the Board for Actuarial Standards in the UK. The basis is to be reviewed during 
early 2008.
For David Brennan, transfer values are calculated to be consistent with the value of the lump sum distribution equivalent to his deferred  >
accrued pension annuity. The minimum permissible value of such a lump sum distribution will be modified in 2008.
As described on page 101, David Brennan will reach age 55 during 2008 at which point he will become entitled to receive his benefits  >
immediately on retirement without reduction for payment before normal pension age. This will result in a recalculation of his transfer value, 
which will be reflected in this table for 2008. The figures shown above reflect David Brennan's participation in the AstraZeneca US Defined 
Benefit Pension Plan (qualified and non-qualified pension plans).
For John Patterson, member contributions of  20,000 ($40,000), being 4% of pensionable salary, are paid through salary sacrifice, and as  >
such no employee contributions are shown above or included within emoluments.
Jonathan Symonds left the Board on 31 July 2007. The values shown in the table are as at 31 July 2007, or the period ending on that  >
date, as appropriate. As described on page 101, Jonathan Symonds benefited from a pension promise equivalent to membership of the 
AstraZeneca UK Defined Benefit Pension Plan, delivered through a combination of savings vehicles and an unfunded top-up benefit to 
deliver the balance. Following his departure, the Company made a cash payment amounting to  3.27 million. The payment extinguishes 
all pension liabilities the Company has in respect of Jonathan Symonds.
Defined contribution arrangements
In addition to the defined benefit arrangements above for David Brennan, an employer matching contribution of  5,000 ($10,000) was made 
to his 401(k) plan during 2007.
Simon Lowth joined the Board on 5 November 2007. As described on page 101, he has chosen to receive the cash allowance in lieu of pension, 
which during 2007 amounted to  22,000 ($44,000).

TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN GRAPHS
The UK Directors' Remuneration Report 
Regulations 2002 require the inclusion in the 
Directors' Remuneration Report of a graph 
showing total shareholder return (TSR) over 
a five year period in respect of a holding of 
the Company's shares, plotted against TSR 
in respect of a hypothetical holding of shares 
of a similar kind and number by reference 
to which a broad equity market index is 
calculated. The Company is a member of 
the FTSE 100 Index and consequently, for 
the purposes of this graph, which is set out 
opposite, we have selected the FTSE 100 
Index as the appropriate index. This graph is 
re-based to 100 at the start of the rolling 
five-year period. We have also included a 
 Pharma Peers Average', which reflects the 
TSR of the same comparator group used for 
the Performance Share Plan graphs opposite.
The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan 
(PSP) referred to on pages 103 to 104 
requires that the TSR in respect of a holding 
of the Company's shares over the relevant 
performance period be compared with the TSR 
of a peer group of 12 other pharmaceutical 
companies. The graphs opposite show 
how the Company's TSR performance has 
compared with the TSR for the companies 
in the comparator group from the first day in 
the relevant three-year performance period 
in respect of each Award to 31 December 
2007 and how the Company ranks against 
those other companies on this basis.
To alleviate any short-term volatility, the return 
index is averaged in the TSR calculations for 
each company over the three months prior 
to the start of the relevant performance 
period (as stipulated in the PSP) and, for the 
purposes of the graphs opposite, over the 
last three months of 2007.

DIRECTORS' INTERESTS IN SHARES
Beneficial interests
The table below shows the interests at 31 December 2007 or on the date of resignation (if earlier) of the persons who on that date were 
Directors (including the interests of their Connected Persons, as such term is defined in the Companies Act 2006) in shares and debentures of 
AstraZeneca PLC. All such interests were beneficial except as otherwise stated. However, interests in Ordinary Shares or American Depositary 
Shares (ADSs) that are the subject of awards under the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan, the AstraZeneca Deferred Bonus Plan or the 
AstraZeneca US Executive Performance Share Plan discussed elsewhere, are not included in the table below but are shown on pages 111 
and 112. None of the Directors has a beneficial interest in the shares of any of the Company's subsidiaries. Between 31 December 2007 and 
31 January 2008 there was no change in the interests in shares and debentures shown in the table below, with the exception of John Patterson 
who acquired a further 625 Ordinary Shares following the exercise of an option under the AstraZeneca Savings Related Share Option Plan.

Unitised stock plans
David Brennan, in common with other participating executives in the US, has interests awarded to him prior to becoming Group CEO in the 
following: the AstraZeneca Executive Deferral Plan, the AstraZeneca Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and the AstraZeneca Savings 
and Security Plan. These are unitised stock plans into which the value of certain previous share incentive awards has been deferred (and 
are not incentive awards in their own right). Participants hold units in each plan, which represents a long-term equity interest in the Company. 
A unit comprises part cash and part ADSs. The overall unit value can be determined daily by taking the market value of the underlying ADSs 
and adding the cash position. The ADSs held within these units carry both voting and dividend rights. David Brennan is deemed to have 
a notional interest in these ADSs, calculated by reference to the fund value and the closing price of ADSs. Therefore, the number of ADSs 
in which a notional interest arises can vary daily as a consequence of stock price movements.
