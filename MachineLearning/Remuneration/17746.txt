The members of the Remuneration Committee 
are John Varley (Chairman of the Committee), 
John Buchanan, Louis Schweitzer and 
Nancy Rothwell. They are all Non-Executive 
Directors. The Board considers them all to be 
independent (Louis Schweitzer was considered 
independent upon his appointment as 
Chairman of the Board; in accordance 
with the UK Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance, the test of independence is not 
appropriate in relation to the Chairman after 
his appointment). The independence of the 
Non-Executive Directors is discussed in more 
detail in the Directors' Report on page 92. 
The Company Secretary acts as the 
secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee met seven 
times in 2008. Each meeting was attended 
by all of its members, except that other 
commitments prevented John Buchanan from 
attending the meetings on 30 January 2008, 
18 March 2008 and 10 December 2008. 
Nancy Rothwell was also unable to attend 
the meeting on 18 March 2008. Other 
commitments prevented Louis Schweitzer from 
attending the meeting on 10 December 2008.
At the request of the Remuneration 
Committee, the Chief Executive Officer and 
certain senior managers were invited to attend 
meetings of the Remuneration Committee 
throughout the year. Accordingly, the following 
attended meetings of the Remuneration 
Committee in 2008, except where their 
own remuneration was being discussed: 
David Brennan (Chief Executive Officer); 
Lynn Tetrault (Executive Vice-President, 
Human Resources and Corporate Affairs); 
and Simon Appleby (Vice-President, 
Performance and Reward). These individuals 
provided advice and services that materially 
assisted the Remuneration Committee during 
the year. In so doing, they drew on various 
sources of data concerning directors' and 
executives' salaries, bonus levels and other 
incentives including general pharmaceutical 
industry reports and surveys, as well as surveys 
specifically carried out for the Company, such 
as those prepared by Towers Perrin. 
During 2008, Carol Arrowsmith of Deloitte LLP 
(Deloitte) was retained by the Remuneration 
Committee to provide it with independent 
advice on all matters being considered by it. 
Deloitte also provided taxation advice and 
other non-audit services to the Company.

polICY ANd puRpoSE
The role of the Remuneration Committee 1. 
is to help the organisation to create value 
for shareholders over time through the 
development and deployment of 
remuneration policies and practices 
that support the implementation of the 
business strategy. 
The Board is committed to maintaining 2. 
a dynamic performance culture, in which 
the Group can compete strongly by 
employing and developing the best talent, 
and where every employee is clear about 
the Group's objectives, how their work 
will impact on those objectives and how 
they will benefit from achieving high levels 
of performance. 
To underpin these objectives, in addition to 3. 
fixed remuneration which comprises basic 
pay, pension, and certain other benefits and 
which is benchmarked against appropriate 
external comparators, the majority of 
employees are eligible to receive an annual 
cash incentive. This incentive is determined 
by reference to corporate, team and 
individual performance. The component 
based on corporate financial performance 
is in the form of EPS. Whilst details of bonus 
plans differ from country to country, the 
EPS component ensures that all eligible 
employees receive an element of reward 
based on the Company's overall financial 
performance. In addition, LTI awards are 
provided to selected senior employees in 
order to align their interests closely with 
those of the Company's shareholders.
Pay for performance principles apply 4. 
throughout the Group and provide 
a consistent framework within which 
executive remuneration decisions are made.
The Remuneration Committee has 5. 
responsibility for determining the 
individual compensation paid to the Chief 
Executive Officer and members of the 
SET; and for the approval of any single 
payment or award over $1,000,000.
The Remuneration Committee seeks 6. 
to ensure that the overall proportion of 
variable pay (bonuses and share-based 
awards) to which Directors and members 
of the SET may become entitled form a 
significant part of their overall remuneration 
opportunity. The Remuneration Committee' s 
objective is to ensure that such variable 
pay is linked to a range of measures 
designed to promote both individual and 
team behaviour and performance in a way 
that supports the success of AstraZeneca 
and creates value for shareholders. Such 
measures are designed to be stretching 
and challenging to the relevant individuals. 
The Group's overall remuneration policy 7. 
and purpose is to:
Attract and retain people of the quality  >
necessary to sustain AstraZeneca 
as one of the best pharmaceutical 
companies in the world. 
Enable AstraZeneca to employ the  >
best people and to develop the best 
talent by recognising and rewarding 
superior performance. 
Motivate these people in order to  >
achieve the level of performance 
necessary to create sustained growth 
in shareholder value through time. 
Align the interests of employees with  >
those of shareholders. 
Align individual and team reward with  >
business performance at each level. 
Encourage employees to perform to  >
their fullest capacity. 
Create pay structures that are fair,  >
equitable and internally consistent. 
Ensure that pay structures are both  >
competitive and cost effective in each 
of the relevant employment markets. 
Ensure proper balance of fixed and  >
variable performance-related pay.
CompoNENTS oF REmuNERATIoN
During 2008, the components of employee 
remuneration (including that of the Executive 
Directors and SET members) comprised fixed 
and variable (ie performance-related) elements, 
as set out below.
Annual salary - based on conditions in the  >
relevant geographic market and the value 
of an individual's sustained personal 
performance to the business, resulting 
from their ability and experience.
Pension arrangements - appropriate to  >
the relevant national market.
Benefits (such as healthcare) -  >
cost-effective and compatible with 
relevant welfare arrangements.
Short-term bonus - a lump sum payment  >
related to the targeted achievement of 
corporate, functional and individual goals, 
measured over a year and contained within 
a specific plan. The corporate goals are 
derived from the annual financial targets 
set by the Board and take into account 
external expectations of performance. 
The functional goals are agreed by the 
Remuneration Committee at the start of 
the year. These functional goals are derived 
from the Business Scorecard, the key 
elements of which are set out in the strategy, 
goals and performance measurement 
table on page 12, and are monitored 
thereafter as part of a Quarterly Business 
Review. Individual goals are based on 
annual objectives, which are linked to 
functional goals. 
LTI arrangements - for selected groups,  >
targeted at the achievement of strategic 
objectives closely aligned with the interests 
of shareholders, namely the AstraZeneca 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) described 
on page 179, and the AstraZeneca Share 
Option Plan described on page 180, and in 
line with market practice. Some individuals 
(primarily those based in the US, but 
excluding Executive Directors) participate 
in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Plan 
described on page 180.

For 2009, the Executive Directors' annual 
salaries are on page 177.
Pension arrangements
The table on page 183 gives details of the 
changes in the value of the Executive 
Directors' accrued pensions during 2008.
US Executive Directors' 
pension arrangements
David Brennan is a member of the AstraZeneca 
US Defined Benefit Pension Plan, by virtue of 
his membership of pension plans applicable 
to legacy Astra Merck employees. Benefits 
for members of this plan are delivered on a 
tax-qualified basis, with accrued benefits that 
exceed specific limits under the plan' s formula 
and the US Tax Code being delivered through 
a supplementary, non-qualified plan. The 
normal pension age under both plans is 65.
As previously disclosed, in September 2008, 
David Brennan satisfied a condition in the 
pension plan relating to combined age 
and service exceeding 85 years, which is 
a condition that applies to all members within 
the pension plan. On leaving or retiring from 
employment, he is eligible to take a pension 
or lump sum equivalent based on accrued 
service and final pensionable pay (ie without 
actuarial reduction). This change in status 
under the pension plan triggered an increase 
in transfer value during 2008.
David Brennan's participation in the pension 
plan is subject to a service cap at 35 years 
service, which will be attained in January 
2011, after which no further service accrual 
can be earned.
Members and, in the event of death, 
surviving spouses/dependants can elect to 
take pensions in lump sum form based on 
actuarial valuation.

Based on AstraZeneca's remuneration policy, 
the charts on page 177 illustrate the potential 
weighting given to fixed and variable elements 
of the remuneration package at Executive 
Director level. Performance-related elements 
of the package are shown on an  Expected 
Value' basis, and in the event that performance 
conditions are not met, such elements would 
not deliver any value. The  Expected Value' 
approach considers the range of possible 
outcomes and the probability attached to each, 
in order to provide a value that represents 
the average that would be delivered if the 
arrangements were operated over many years. 
The  Expected Value' for bonus payment is 
taken to be the target payout level.
FIXEd REmuNERATIoN
All Executive Directors' terms and conditions 
are UK-based, apart from David Brennan's 
pension and health insurance arrangements, 
which are described below. 
Basic salary
The basic salary for each Executive Director 
and SET member is determined by the 
Remuneration Committee. Recognising 
the external economic environment, the 
Remuneration Committee did not increase 
the salaries of Executive Directors or other 
members of the SET for 2009, other than 
in respect of situations where additional 
responsibilities had been taken on. Salary 
decisions reflect the experience and 
sustained performance of the individuals to 
whom they apply, taking account of market 
competitiveness and the level of increases 
applicable to employees in the wider Group. 
For the Executive Directors and other 
members of the SET, the policy has been 
to position salaries at or slightly above the 
median of the relevant market.
The way in which these elements of 
remuneration were combined and applied 
varied according to a range of factors including 
specific business needs and practices in 
different geographic markets, although, in 
general, the more senior the role within the 
business, the greater the proportion of total 
remuneration was made up from variable pay.
Components of remuneration are taken into 
account both separately and in their totality 
in judging the value of a package. For 2009, 
the Company will continue to benchmark 
against appropriate comparator companies 
and will assess whether or not and to what 
extent the overall opportunities for remuneration 
offered by the current structure of remuneration 
remain appropriate in the context of changes 
within the business and the external 
environment in which it operates.
Recognising that shareholder approval to 
operate the AstraZeneca Share Option Plan 
will expire at the end of its 10-year life during 
2010, and that it will be necessary to seek 
further shareholder approval in order to 
continue operating the plan beyond this date, 
the Remuneration Committee intends to 
consider whether or not the Company's 
established remuneration policy and the 
operation of the existing incentive plans 
continue to meet the needs of the business 
in securing key senior executive talent to 
grow shareholder value. This will build on a 
review of remuneration policy started during 
2008. To the extent that any material changes 
are to be proposed as a consequence of this 
review, the Remuneration Committee will 
consult with shareholders in advance of next 
year's AGM.

Benefits
In conjunction with the majority of employers, 
certain benefits are made available to the 
Executive Directors and members of the SET 
via local benefits programmes offered by 
AstraZeneca. Benefits under these programmes 
typically include health care, insurances and 
facilitated car purchase arrangements.
VARIABlE REmuNERATIoN
Executive Directors and members of the 
SET are eligible to participate in a number 
of different elements of variable pay, which 
are described below. The decision as to 
whether or not in any given year the Executive 
Directors and members of the SET receive 
any or all of their elements of variable pay is 
determined by the Remuneration Committee, 
which will typically have regard to the 
performance of the individual and will consider 
the elements of variable pay applicable 
to senior employees in other comparable 
organisations in making such a determination.
Short-term bonus
Performance criteria
All Executive Directors and members of 
the SET are eligible for a short-term bonus. 
The basis for the payment of any short-term 
bonus is determined by reference to a range 
of factors linked to the underlying performance 
of AstraZeneca's business, the performance 
of the functional area for which the individual 
is responsible and the performance of the 
individual in his or her role. 
Structure and assessment of performance
The annual bonus for Executive Directors and 
members of the SET is based on performance 
criteria linked to the following targets:
50% by reference to EPS targets set at  >
the start of the financial year;
25% by reference to measures and  >
initiatives as set out in, or derived from, 
the strategy, goals and performance 
measurement table on page 12 relevant to 
the individual's functional accountability (or, 
in the case of the Chief Executive Officer, the 
average of these individual outcomes); and
25% by a balance of qualitative and  >
quantitative objectives that address overall 
business performance, the key elements 
of which are set out in the strategy, goals 
and performance measurement table on 
page 12.
to HM Revenue & Customs limits, in return 
for an adjustment to their own pension of 
equivalent actuarial value. Pensions are also 
payable to dependent children.
Pensions in payment are increased annually 
in line with inflation, as measured by the UK 
Retail Prices Index, up to a maximum of 5%.
Simon Lowth (Chief Financial Officer) is 
eligible to join AstraZeneca's main UK defined 
contribution pension plan at a Company 
contribution rate of 24% of annual basic 
salary, or alternatively, to take the Company 
contribution as a cash allowance. For the 
option year 2008/2009, he has elected to 
take the cash allowance (as detailed in the 
pensions section on page 183).
In the event of a senior employee in the main 
UK defined benefit pension plan becoming 
incapacitated, then a pension is payable 
immediately as if such person had reached 
normal retirement age (subject to a maximum 
of 10 years' additional service), based on 
current pensionable salary. In the event of 
a member's death prior to retirement, 
dependants are entitled to a pension of 
two-thirds of the pension that would have 
been earned had the deceased remained in 
service to age 62, plus a capital sum of four 
times pensionable pay.
In the event of a senior employee in the 
main UK defined contribution pension plan 
(or where an alternative cash allowance has 
been taken) becoming incapacitated, then 
permanent health insurance cover provides 
continuation of a proportion of salary subject to 
the satisfaction of certain medical criteria. In the 
event of death prior to retirement, dependants 
are entitled to a pension and/or lump sum 
secured from a multiple of ten times salary.
In addition, David Brennan is a contributing 
member of the US 401(k) savings plan
2
, as 
applies to all US employees. 
In the event of a US participant becoming 
incapacitated then permanent health 
insurance cover will provide continuation 
of a proportion of salary, subject to the 
satisfaction of certain medical criteria.
UK Executive Directors' 
pension arrangements
UK Executive Directors have the option to 
participate in the UK Pension Fund according 
to their eligibility, or to take a cash allowance 
in lieu of pension. The cash allowance is 
consistent with the appropriate value of the 
alternative gross pension benefit.
John Patterson (Executive Director, 
Development) elected to take the cash 
allowance in lieu of pension for the option 
year 2008/2009 (as detailed in the pensions 
table on page 183).
In respect of pension accrued up to that point 
he remains a member of the AstraZeneca 
main UK defined benefit pension plan. 
The normal pension age under this plan is 
62. However, a member's accrued pension 
is available from age 60 without any actuarial 
reduction. John Patterson, having reached age 
60 in January 2008, on retiring on 31 March 
2009, will be eligible to take a pension based 
on accrued service and final pensionable pay.
On death in retirement, the accrued pension 
is guaranteed payable for the first five years 
of retirement and then reduces to two-thirds 
of this amount should there be a surviving 
spouse or other dependant. Any member 
may choose higher or lower levels of 
survivor's pensions at retirement, subject

 The 401(k) savings plan is a qualified plan to which 
eligible employees may make salary-deferral 
contributions on a post-tax and/or pre-tax basis. 
Employers may also make matching or non-elective 
contributions to the plan. There is a supplementary 
non-qualified plan in place for all eligible employees 
whose earnings exceed specific limits. 178
ASTRAZENECA ANNuAl REpoRT ANd FoRm 20-F INFoRmATIoN 2008
These achievements were underpinned by 
a continuing emphasis on cost discipline, 
improved productivity and performance 
management. Having assessed the 
Company's performance as set out above, 
the Remuneration Committee is satisfied 
that the bonus payments that have been 
earned against stretching performance 
targets that were set at the start of the year 
are fully justified.
Bonus share deferral requirements
Consistent with best practice, the 
Remuneration Committee has put in place 
a requirement that a certain proportion of any 
short-term bonus payment be deferred and 
invested into Ordinary Shares or American 
Depositary Shares (ADSs) in the Company 
acquired on the open market at the prevailing 
market price and held on behalf of individual 
Executive Directors and SET members by the 
Company for a period of three years from the 
date of acquisition. This arrangement is one 
of the ways in which, over time, Executive 
Directors and members of the SET will be 
able to build up a significant shareholding in 
the Company. Although the delivery of these 
shares to the individual after three years is not 
contingent on the continued performance of 
the Company, the Remuneration Committee 
has reserved the right to retrospectively alter 
bonus outcomes in circumstances where it 
does not consider that the delivery of shares 
is warranted by the underlying performance 
of the business. The proportion currently 
deferred into shares is one third of the pre-tax 
bonus for Executive Directors and one sixth 
for all other SET members. On leaving, 
participants would normally have to wait for 
the shares to be released at the end of the 
three-year period.
Long-term incentive plans
Executive Directors and members of the SET 
may also be granted share options under the 
AstraZeneca Share Option Plan and awards 
under the AstraZeneca Performance Share 
Plan. The grant of such options and award 
of such shares are determined by the 
Remuneration Committee, as are the 
performance targets that apply to their 
vesting and/or exercise. Both of these 
schemes are intended to align the interests 
of Executive Directors and members of the 
SET with those of shareholders. Following 
the exercise of an option under the 
AstraZeneca Share Option Plan it is the 
expectation of the Remuneration Committee 
that Executive Directors and members of the 
Bonus outcomes for 2008
Bonus outcomes for 2008 reflected 
performance in respect of EPS, together 
with overall business and financial outcomes 
and relevant functional performance against 
clear measures and initiatives in support of the 
strategic priorities and business objectives, 
the key elements of which are set out in the 
strategy, goals and performance measurement 
table on page 12, in relation to the following 
categories which are consistent with delivering 
shareholder value:
Strengthen the pipeline. >
Grow the business. >
Reshape the business. >
Promote a culture of responsibility  >
and accountability. 
The bonus outcomes for the Executive 
Directors for 2008 are shown in the table below.
In respect of the assessment of bonuses 
for 2008, EPS (excluding restructuring and 
synergy costs), global sales and operating 
profit (excluding restructuring and synergy 
costs) were taken into account in particular 
by the Remuneration Committee, which also 
noted growth in the share price and relative 
total shareholder return (TSR) performance. 
The Remuneration Committee also noted 
that the development pipeline now comprises 
98 clinical projects. The Phase III portfolio 
remained constant with 10 projects. We 
delivered 32 FGLPs and delivered 17 first time 
in man. Good progress was made in product 
development life-cycle management with eight 
significant submissions across a number of 
jurisdictions, and two product submissions. 
Following a review by the Remuneration 
Committee, it has been agreed that the 
performance criteria for the determination 
of annual bonus for Executive Directors and 
members of the SET for bonus year 2009 
will be adjusted to align with the current 
objectives and measures that are used by 
the business as follows:
60% by reference to a group of Corporate  >
objectives comprising: EPS and cash flow 
targets, together with objectives in each 
of the strategic priority areas identified 
by the Board for the business, the key 
elements of which are set out in the 
strategy, goals and performance 
measurement table on page 12; and
40% by reference to individual measures  >
and initiatives which link to the business 
objectives relevant to the individual's 
functional accountability (or, in the case 
of the Chief Executive Officer, the average 
of these individual outcomes).
These changes will further enhance 
AstraZeneca's emphasis on individual and 
business accountability. The key measures 
referred to above are clearly set out in the 
strategy, goals and performance measurement 
table described on page 12, whereby Group 
and Functional objectives and measures are 
managed in a robust and consistent way and 
assessed by the SET as part of a Quarterly 
Business Review. The outcome of this process 
is rigorously scrutinised by the Board.

allow Awards to vest or to only allow them 
to partially vest where this appears to the 
Remuneration Committee to be warranted. 
The Remuneration Committee has the 
discretion to award Shares up to a further 25% 
over and above the Shares subject to the 
Award, if the Company's TSR performance 
is substantially better than that of the upper 
quartile of the comparator group. 
Individual limit
In respect of any financial year, the maximum 
market value of Shares that may be put under 
Award in respect of an employee is 500% 
of that employee's basic salary. This limit 
excludes the above 25% maximum additional 
Shares that may vest, at the sole discretion of 
the Remuneration Committee, if the Company' s 
TSR performance is substantially above 
that of the upper quartile of the comparator 
group. For Awards to vest at this level, the 
Company would need to have sustained 
a level of performance well in excess of 
upper quartile over a period of years and 
the Remuneration Committee would need 
to be satisfied that this was warranted.
The actual individual limits that apply under the 
PSP , subject to this maximum, are set by the 
Remuneration Committee from time to time.

the companies in the comparator group from 
the first day of the relevant performance 
period to 31 December 2008 and how the 
Company ranks against those other peer 
companies on this basis. We will continue 
to report on the performance of each Award 
against the relevant performance target 
during the relevant vesting period.
Change in control provisions
On a change in control of the Company as a 
result of a general offer to acquire the whole 
of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company, Awards will vest pro-rata to the 
time elapsed between the date of grant of the 
Award and the date of the change in control 
to the extent that the relevant performance 
targets have been met up to the date of the 
change in control (or the most practicable 
earlier date). The Remuneration Committee 
will, however, have discretion to take into 
account any other factors it believes to be 
relevant in determining the extent to which 
Awards will vest in these circumstances.
in relevant employment under certain 
circumstances during the vesting period 
to the extent that the performance targets 
have been met.
Performance period and vesting dates
In the case of all Awards granted so far, the 
performance target relates to the three-year 
period commencing on 1 January of the year 
of grant. Thus, for the Awards made in 2008, 
the performance period runs from 1 January 
2008 to 31 December 2010. The vesting date 
is the third anniversary of the date of grant. 
Performance targets
For all Awards so far to Executive Directors 
and SET members, the performance target 
is the Company's TSR over the relevant 
three-year period compared with the TSR 
of a selected peer group of pharmaceutical 
companies for the same period. These 
companies are currently a total of 12: Abbott 
Laboratories, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, 
GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, 
Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, Sanofi-Aventis, 
Schering-Plough and Wyeth.
TSR evaluates share price growth and 
dividends re-invested in respect of a notional 
number of shares, from the beginning of the 
relevant performance period to the end of 
it, and ranks the companies in the selected 
comparator group by reference to their TSR 
achieved over that period. The rank which 
the Company's TSR achieves over the 
performance period will determine how 
many Shares will vest under the relevant 
Award, as per the vesting schedule shown 
in the table below: 
TSR ranking  Vesting percentage of 
of the Company Shares under Award %
Below median 0
Median 30
Upper quartile 100
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata
Significantly above upper quartile up to 125
To alleviate any short-term volatility, the return 
index is averaged in the TSR calculations 
for each company over the three months 
prior to the start and end of the relevant 
performance period.
In addition to the TSR performance target 
being met for each Award as set out above, 
the Remuneration Committee also has to 
satisfy itself that achievement of the TSR 
performance target is a genuine reflection 
of the Company's underlying financial 
performance and has the discretion to not 
SET will retain the net number of shares from 
the exercise for a period of not less than six 
months from the date of exercise.
Shareholding guidelines
For Executive Directors and members of 
the SET, the Remuneration Committee has 
established target shareholding guidelines, 
under which it is expected that they build up 
their own holding of shares in the Company, 
equivalent to their basic salary. It is expected 
that these shareholding targets will be 
reached in part through shares delivered 
from the various LTI arrangements as well 
as the deferred part of the short-term bonus 
(described above).
AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan
The AstraZeneca PSP was approved by 
shareholders at the AGM in 2005 and provides 
for the grant of performance share awards 
(Awards) over Ordinary Shares or ADSs in 
AstraZeneca PLC (together, the Shares). 
Basis of participation
The Remuneration Committee is responsible 
for setting the policy for the way in which the 
PSP should be operated, including agreeing 
performance targets, identifying which 
employees should be invited to participate in 
the PSP and the level of Awards. Participation 
is highly selective and tends only to include 
senior employees on the basis of their 
performance. Awards are not pensionable and 
may not generally be assigned or transferred.
Generally, Awards can be granted at any 
time (although in practice they are awarded 
annually), but not during a close period of the 
Company. In 2008, the main grant of Awards 
was made on 28 March, with other awards 
approved by the Remuneration Committee 
in relation to, for example, new appointments 
or promotions granted on 22 August. The 
value of the shares subject to the Award 
is determined by reference to the market 
price of Shares over the three-day period 
immediately preceding the date of grant.
Details of Awards to Executive Directors are 
shown in the table on page 186.
Performance conditions
Save in exceptional circumstances, which 
are prescribed in the PSP rules, the vesting 
of Awards is contingent on the satisfaction of 
specified performance targets and continued 
employment with the Group. In addition to 
the satisfaction of these performance targets, 
Awards will generally not vest until the third 
anniversary of the date of grant although 
Awards may vest in part on a time pro-rated 
basis where a participant ceases to be  180
ASTRAZENECA ANNuAl REpoRT ANd FoRm 20-F INFoRmATIoN 2008
Dilution
The dilutive effect of the grants of Awards on 
the Company's issued share capital was also 
considered by the Remuneration Committee, 
in accordance with its commitment, reflecting 
the guidance of the Association of British 
Insurers, that the percentage of the issued 
share capital that could be allocated under 
all of the Company's employee share plans 
over a period of 10 years should be under 
10%. This commitment is applied by the 
Remuneration Committee in practice as 
a limit, on average, of under 1% per annum. 
The Remuneration Committee concluded that 
a grant of Awards to those plan participants 
and individual Executive Directors proposed 
for a grant was appropriate given the level 
of performance achieved. None of the other 
LTI arrangements currently operated by the 
Company have a dilutive effect because they 
do not involve the issue and allotment of new 
Shares or ADSs in the Company but rather 
rely on the market purchase of Shares or 
ADSs that have already been issued.
Zeneca 1994 Executive 
Share Option Scheme
This plan was replaced by the AstraZeneca 
SOP . The last grant of options under this 
plan was in March 2000. Certain Executive 
Directors and members of the SET have 
options outstanding under this plan, all of 
which are exercisable, the performance 
conditions having been satisfied. A description 
of this plan can be found on page 142.
Other plans
In addition to the plans described above, 
the Company operates a Share Incentive 
Plan and a Savings-Related Share Option 
Plan, both of which are UK HM Revenue & 
Customs approved plans. Certain Executive 
Directors and members of the SET are 
eligible to participate in these plans, more 
detailed descriptions of which can be found 
on pages 139 and 142.
Restricted Stock Unit Plans
The AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP 
Restricted Stock Unit Award Plan (RSU Plan) 
was introduced in 2007 and provides for the 
grant of restricted stock unit awards (Awards) 
to selected employees (predominantly in the 
US). The MedImmune, Inc. 2008 Restricted 
Stock Unit Award Plan (MedImmune RSU 
Plan) was introduced in 2008 to make awards 
to employees of MedImmune. The RSU Plan 
and MedImmune RSU Plan are used in 
conjunction with the AstraZeneca SOP to 
As well as taking into account these 
performance considerations at the point of 
granting Awards, the Remuneration Committee 
imposed performance conditions in respect 
of the exercise of such Awards in respect 
of members of the SET (including the 
Executive Directors) which, in the view of the 
Remuneration Committee were considered 
appropriately stretching. In order for Awards 
to vest, the EPS of the Group must increase 
at least in line with the UK Retail Price Index 
plus 5% per annum on average, over a three 
year period, the base figure being the EPS 
for the financial year preceding the date of 
grant, with no re-testing. In addition, since 
the review of executive remuneration in 2004, 
the Remuneration Committee has included 
a condition that, if an event occurs which 
causes material reputational damage to the 
Company, such that it is not appropriate for 
the Awards to vest and become exercisable, 
the Remuneration Committee can make a 
determination to reflect this.
The Remuneration Committee also sought 
and received assurances that each individual 
proposed for the grant of an Award has been 
performing in a manner that justified a grant to 
them. There was some variation in the level of 
grants being proposed between individuals, 
to reflect differing levels of performance and 
their seniority within the business.
Change in control provisions
On a change in control of the Company 
as a result of a general offer to acquire the 
whole of the issued ordinary share capital 
of the Company, any unvested Awards vest 
immediately following the change in control. 
All outstanding vested Awards can be 
exercised during the period of six months 
from the date of the change in control. 
The Company will use its best endeavours 
to ensure that any shares acquired from an 
exercise following a change in control are 
subject to the same terms as shares of the 
same class were acquired under the general 
offer. Unexercised Awards will lapse at the 
end of the six-month period following a change 
in control or, if the Award is exchanged for an 
option relating to shares in a different company, 
the date of exchange, whichever is earlier.
AstraZeneca Share Option Plan
The AstraZeneca Share Option Plan (SOP) 
was approved by shareholders at the AGM 
in 2000 and provides for the grant of share 
option awards (Awards) over Ordinary 
Shares or ADSs in AstraZeneca PLC 
(together, the Shares).
This plan was approved for a period of 
10 years. Recognising this, the Company 
intends to begin the process of consulting 
with key institutional shareholders during 
2009 in relation to any proposal to adopt 
a new plan for 2010.
Basis of participation
The Remuneration Committee is responsible 
for setting the policy for the way in which the 
SOP should be operated, including agreeing 
performance targets and identifying which 
employees should be invited to participate 
and the level of Awards. Participation is highly 
selective and tends only to include senior 
employees on the basis of their performance 
(except in the US where for cultural reasons, 
participation in the SOP is more widespread). 
Awards are not pensionable and may not 
generally be assigned or transferred.
Generally, Awards can be granted at any time, 
but not during a close period of the Company. 
In 2008, grants of Awards were made on 
28 March and 22 August. The exercise price 
is fixed by reference to the market price of 
Shares over the three-day period immediately 
preceding the date of grant.
Details of Awards to Executive Directors are 
shown in the table on page 187.
Performance conditions
The AstraZeneca SOP , in particular, requires 
the Remuneration Committee, before agreeing 
to grant an Award to Executive Directors 
and others, to consider whether or not the 
underlying performance of the Company 
justifies a grant. In addition, it must also be 
satisfied that each individual nominated is 
performing to the necessary standard. 
In agreeing grants of Awards in 2008, the 
Remuneration Committee took into account 
strong underlying financial performance and 
progress towards achieving longer-term goals.  181

Policy on external appointments 
and retention of fees
Subject to the specific approval of the 
Board in each case, Executive Directors and 
members of the SET may accept external 
appointments as non-executive directors of 
other companies and retain any related fees 
paid to them provided always that such 
external appointments are not considered by 
the Board to prevent or reduce the ability of 
the Executive to perform his or her role to the 
required standard. Such appointments are 
seen as a way in which Executives can gain 
a broader business experience and, in turn, 
benefit the Company.
John Patterson is a non-executive director of 
Cobham plc. In respect of such position, he 
retained the fees paid to him for his services 
which, in 2008, totalled  51,500.
Non-Executive Directors
None of the Non-Executive Directors has 
a service contract. They are not eligible for 
performance-related bonuses or the grant 
of share options. No pension contributions 
are made on their behalf. None of the 
Non-Executive Directors has participated 
or will participate in any decision made by 
the Board in relation to the determination of 
their own fees. In addition to the mandatory 
shareholding requirement imposed on all 
Directors under the Company's Articles 
of Association described on page 197, 
in December 2008 the Board agreed that 
each Non-Executive Director should also 
be encouraged to build up, over time, 
a shareholding in the Company with a value 
approximately equivalent to the basic annual 
fee for a Non-Executive Director ( 60,000) or, 
in the case of the Chairman, approximately 
equivalent to his annual fee ( 325,000).
provide a mix of restricted stock units and 
share options. Awards typically vest on the 
third anniversary of the date of grant and are 
contingent on continued employment with 
AstraZeneca. In 2008, Awards were made 
under these plans on 28 March and 22 August. 
Neither of these plans is used to make Awards 
to Executive Directors or SET members.
Restricted Share Plan
The AstraZeneca Restricted Share Plan was 
introduced in 2008 and provides for the grant 
of restricted share awards to key employees, 
excluding serving Executive Directors. 
Awards are made on an ad hoc basis with 
variable vesting dates. The plan has been 
used twice in 2008 to make awards to four 
employees. The Remuneration Committee 
has responsibility for agreeing any awards 
under the plan and for setting the policy for the 
way in which the plan should be operated.
Service contracts
Details of the service contracts for each of 
the Executive Directors, including their notice 
periods, are set out below. The notice 
periods in the Executive Directors' service 
contracts are 12 months. It is the Board's 
intention that, in the event of early termination 
of an Executive Director's employment, any 
compensation payable under the service 
contract should not exceed the salary and 
benefits that would have been received had 
the contractual notice period been worked 
and this may be further reduced in line with 
the Executive Director' s duty to mitigate losses. 
Compensation for any bonus entitlement will 
be assessed initially as  on target' but subject 
to adjustment by the Remuneration Committee 
to take account of the particular circumstances 
of the termination.

Notes
> For John Patterson, transfer values are calculated on the market related basis used by the AstraZeneca UK Pension Plan, in line with the GN11 guidance note published 
by the Board for Actuarial Standards in the UK. The basis was reviewed during 2008 and this resulted in an increase in his transfer value of  993,000 ($1,860,000). 
> For David Brennan, transfer values are calculated to be consistent with the value of the lump sum distribution equivalent to his deferred accrued pension annuity. 
The minimum permissible value of such a lump sum distribution was modified in 2008.
> As described on page 176, David Brennan reached age 55 during 2008 at which point he became entitled to receive his benefits immediately on retirement without 
reduction for payment before normal pension age. This results in a recalculation of his transfer value, which is reflected in this table for 2008. The figures shown above 
reflect David Brennan's participation in the AstraZeneca US Defined Benefit Pension Plan (qualified and non-qualified pension plans).
> For John Patterson, member contributions of  11,000 ($21,000), being 4% of pensionable salary for the first half of 2008 before he opted for cash in lieu, are paid 
through salary sacrifice, and as such no employee contributions are shown above or included within emoluments.
dEFINEd CoNTRIBuTIoN ARRANGEmENTS
In addition to the defined benefit arrangements above for David Brennan, an employer matching contribution of  49,000 ($91,000) was made 
to his 401(k) plan and associated non-qualified plan during 2008.
In addition to the defined benefit arrangements described above for John Patterson, as described on page 177, he has chosen to receive a 
cash allowance in lieu of pension, which during the second half of 2008 amounted to  84,000 ($157,000).
Simon Lowth joined the Board on 5 November 2007. As described on page 177, he has chosen to receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension, 
which during 2008 amounted to  132,000 ($247,000).

The UK Directors' Remuneration Report 
Regulations 2002 require the inclusion in the 
Directors' Remuneration Report of a graph 
showing total shareholder return (TSR) over 
a five year period in respect of a holding of 
the Company's shares, plotted against TSR 
in respect of a hypothetical holding of shares 
of a similar kind and number by reference 
to which a broad equity market index is 
calculated. The Company is a member of 
the FTSE 100 Index and consequently, for 
the purposes of this graph, which is set out 
opposite, we have selected the FTSE 100 
Index as the appropriate index. This graph 
is re-based to 100 at the start of the rolling 
five-year period. We have also included a 
 Pharma Peers Average', which reflects the 
TSR of the same comparator group used for 
the Performance Share Plan graphs opposite.
The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan 
(PSP) referred to on page 179 requires that the 
TSR in respect of a holding of the Company's 
shares over the relevant performance period 
be compared with the TSR of a peer group 
of 12 other pharmaceutical companies. The 
graphs opposite show how the Company's 
TSR performance has compared with the 
TSR for the companies in the comparator 
group from the first day in the relevant 
three-year performance period in respect of 
each Award to 31 December 2008 and how 
the Company ranks against those other 
companies on this basis.
To alleviate any short-term volatility, the return 
index is averaged in the TSR calculations for 
each company over the three months prior to 
the start of the relevant performance period 
(as stipulated in the PSP) and, for the 
purposes of the graphs opposite, over the 
last three months of 2008.

BENEFICIAl INTERESTS
The table below shows the interests at 31 December 2008 or on the date of resignation (if earlier) of the persons who on that date were 
Directors (including the interests of their Connected Persons, as such term is defined in the Companies Act 2006) in shares and debentures 
of AstraZeneca PLC. All such interests were beneficial except as otherwise stated. However, interests in Ordinary Shares or ADSs that are the 
subject of awards under the AstraZeneca PSP , the AstraZeneca Deferred Bonus Plan or the AstraZeneca US Executive Performance Share 
Plan discussed elsewhere, are not included in the table below but are shown on page 186 to page 187. None of the Directors has a beneficial 
interest in the shares of any of the Company's subsidiaries. Between 31 December 2008 and 29 January 2009 there was no change in the 
interests in shares and debentures shown in the table below.

uNITISEd ST oCK plANS
David Brennan, in common with other participating executives in the US, has interests awarded to him prior to him becoming Chief Executive 
Officer in the following: the AstraZeneca Executive Deferral Plan, the AstraZeneca Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and the AstraZeneca 
Savings and Security Plan. These are unitised stock plans into which the value of certain previous share incentive awards has been deferred (and 
are not incentive awards in their own right). Participants hold units in each plan, which represents a long-term equity interest in the Company. 
A unit comprises part cash and part ADSs. The overall unit value can be determined daily by taking the market value of the underlying ADSs 
and adding the cash position. The ADSs held within these units carry both voting and dividend rights. David Brennan is deemed to have a 
notional beneficial interest in these ADSs, calculated by reference to the fund value and the closing price of ADSs. Therefore, the number of 
ADSs in which a notional beneficial interest arises can vary daily as a consequence of stock price movements.
