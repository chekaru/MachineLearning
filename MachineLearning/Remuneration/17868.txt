 > Proposed changes to performance 
metrics (but not to the rules nor the 
quantum of compensation opportunity)  
of the PSP are under consideration. The 
Remuneration Committee will consult the 
Group's largest investors about the PSP 
proposals and will take those views into 
account before reaching its final decision. 
This consultation process will take place 
in the first quarter of 2013 and before  
any awards are made under the PSP .  
The Remuneration Committee's intention 
in considering these changes is to  
ensure that the PSP continues to provide 
incentives for management to perform 
successfully against a balance of both 
financial and non-financial metrics. 
Further information about the new  
PSP performance metrics will be made 
available at the AGM. Shareholders will  
of course have an opportunity to vote  
on the new PSP arrangements as part  
of the vote on remuneration policy to be 
introduced by the new UK Department  
for Business, Innovation & Skills' executive 
remuneration proposals, which we expect 
to be implemented with effect from 2014.
Given the Board changes during the year, 
the Remuneration Committee gave careful 
consideration to a number of related 
remuneration matters. In particular, the 
remuneration package for our new CEO;  
the arrangements for Simon Lowth's  
four months service as Interim CEO  
and his return to the role of CFO; and the 
arrangements relating to the retirement  
of our former CEO, David Brennan. We 
consulted with our major investors where 
appropriate on these matters, and related 
information was provided to the market  
by way of announcements at the relevant 
times. The arrangements are described  
in detail in this Remuneration Report.
threshold under the AstraZeneca 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) in March 
2012 (relating to performance over the  
period 2012 to 2014 inclusive), which is 
lower (principally but not solely because  
of patent expiry) than the equivalent  
cash flow targets applicable to previous 
awards (details are set out on pages  
129 and 130).
Following Pascal Soriot's appointment  
as CEO in October, the Remuneration 
Committee has been reviewing the 
Company's remuneration framework.  
The Remuneration Committee wishes  
to ensure that remuneration structures 
continue to be closely aligned with the 
Company's strategy, and that they  
will support and drive achievement  
of our business objectives.
The Remuneration Committee is  
proposing a number of changes to both 
short-term and long-term incentive 
arrangements for Executive Directors  
and other senior executives. 
 > The composition of performance  
metrics for the annual bonus plan will be 
adjusted. From 2013, they will be based 
on an integrated Group scorecard that 
includes both financial and non-financial 
performance metrics, as well as reflecting 
individual performance. No changes are 
being made to the funding of the bonus 
pool, the overall quantum at the Group  
or individual level, or the payout curve. 
The new integrated Group scorecard will 
be based on four key priorities:  Achieve 
scientific leadership',  Restore growth', 
 Achieve Group financial targets' and 
 Ensure AstraZeneca is a great place  
to work', with all but the last scorecard 
priority forming part of the financial 
determination of the bonus outcome. 
Targets for each category have been  
set for 2013.
The performance of AstraZeneca as set  
out in this Annual Report was mixed. 
Revenues and profit were down versus  
prior year. Although Core earnings per share 
and cash flow fell versus 2011, they both 
exceeded targets set at the beginning of the 
year. Shareholders also had mixed fortunes. 
Total shareholder return performance was 
weak. But cash distributions (including 
buybacks) reflected the strong cash flow 
generation, which also supported the 
strengthening of the product pipeline through 
the acquisition of Ardea, the collaboration 
with Amgen and the extension of our 
diabetes alliance with BMS. We know that 
our shareholders expect pay appropriately 
to reflect performance. The Remuneration 
Committee has taken these diverse factors 
and expectations into account in making  
its judgements in 2012. 
The business environment for the Company 
will continue to be challenging in 2013, and 
beyond, in terms of the fiscal pressures on 
governments, which in most markets have  
a direct affect on the Company's business; 
the need to continue to address R&D 
productivity; and the need to maintain a 
level of investment that is right for the future 
of AstraZeneca but which is also balanced 
against shareholders' expectations for 
return on their investment in the Company. 
The Remuneration Committee has to take  
a judicious view of performance stretch  
and reward. So performance targets must 
be stretching; but not so stretching as to 
compromise or weaken incentivisation.  
For example, we have increased for 2013, 
many of the revenue targets in priority areas 
(Emerging Market sales and sales of Brilinta/
Brilique would be two cases in point). But 
the environmental factors referred to above 
were also recognised by the Remuneration 
Committee in setting the free cash flow

Strategy Performance Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Overview
There are a number of ways in which  
we seek to listen and respond to the views  
of shareholders on remuneration matters 
during the year, including at the AGM, and 
via consultation with the Company's largest 
investors about specific remuneration 
matters. In the latter part of each year, the 
Company usually hosts a meeting to which 
we invite our largest shareholders and seek 
their views on executive remuneration and 
corporate governance more broadly. In 
previous years, a number of Non-Executive 
Directors have been available to shareholders 
at that meeting, including the Chairman  
of the Board, myself as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee as well as other 
Board members. Although we cancelled  
the meeting proposed to be held in 
December in anticipation of our dialogue 
with shareholders on remuneration matters 
in the first quarter of 2013, we intend to 
continue to hold such meetings annually, 
with the aim of maintaining a constructive 
discussion with shareholders on these topics.
Anticipating the coming into effect of  
the new regulations proposed by the UK 
Department for Business, Innovation & 
Skills, we have taken the opportunity to 
structure this 2012 Directors' Remuneration 
Report to incorporate a number of the 
proposed features. As a result, this 
Remuneration Report has been prepared 
with separate sections that set out, first,  
our remuneration policy (Policy Report)  
and, second, how that policy has been 
implemented in 2012 (Implementation 
Report). We have not yet produced a 
Remuneration Report that is fully compliant 
with the proposed new regulations because 
they are still to be published in their final 
form. But our 2013 Remuneration Report 
will fully reflect the new regulations and we 
will place resolutions before shareholders 
accordingly at the 2014 AGM. 
As last year, we have sought in this 
Remuneration Report to answer the 
question: what have we paid our Executive 
Directors and why? The answer to this 
question is largely contained in the 
Implementation Report, which commences 
on page 127 . To simplify the narrative and 
structure of this year's Remuneration Report 
we have placed a lot of detailed disclosure 
(including pensions, the fees paid to the 
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors,  
and facts and figures relating to the long- 
term incentive plans) in the Appendix  
from page 131. We have taken into account 
Group and individual performance in 2012.  
We are guided in our judgements by our 
compensation schemes and their rules.  
But we know that we must exercise 
appropriate discretion to ensure that reward 
outcomes at AstraZeneca are appropriately 
consistent with the protection of your 
interests as our shareholders. 
As ever, we would welcome your feedback.

specific Group and individual 
objectives.
An annual cash incentive opportunity determined 
by reference to an integrated Group scorecard 
and individual performance, measured over  
a single financial year of the Company relative  
to targets set at the beginning of each year.
The Remuneration Committee requires that 
certain percentages of the annual bonus are 
converted into stock to be held for three years 
before vesting.
The Group performance measures ensure  
that all eligible employees receive an element  
of reward based on the Group's overall financial 
and non-financial performance.
Individual goals are based on annual objectives.

AstraZeneca  
Performance  
Share Plan (PSP)
1
As described in the 
introduction to this 
Remuneration Report  
from the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, 
changes to performance 
metrics for the PSP are 
under consideration. It is 
planned that consultation 
with shareholders and 
implementation of the 
changes will take place  
in 2013. The information  
set out in this table refers  
to awards made under  
the PSP, up to and  
including 2012.
The PSP rewards the 
outperformance of industry 
peers in terms of shareholder 
value creation measured by 
relative TSR, and the generation 
of cash at levels to finance 
investment in the business, debt 
repayment and the Company's 
shareholder distribution policy.
The PSP was approved by shareholders at the 
2005 AGM and provides for the grant of awards 
over Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
The three year performance periods commence 
on 1 January in the year of the award. The 
vesting date is the third anniversary of the date  
of the award.
In respect of any financial year of the Company, 
the maximum market value of shares that may  
in theory be put under an award under the  
PSP is 500% of a participant's base salary 
(which converts into an expected value of 250%).  
The actual individual limits that apply under  
the PSP, subject to this maximum, are set by  
the Remuneration Committee from time to time.
In the event that employment ceases for anything 
other than a  good leaver' reason, any unvested 
awards lapse unless the Remuneration 
Committee decides otherwise.
Fifty percent based on the relative TSR 
performance of the Company over the relevant 
three year performance period against  
a predetermined peer group of global 
pharmaceutical companies.
Fifty percent based on the achievement of  
a cumulative free cash flow target over the relevant 
three year performance period, based on  
a sliding scale between a threshold target  
and an upper target.
More information about the PSP's performance 
measures is set out on page 129.
AstraZeneca Investment  
Plan (AZIP)
1
The performance and holding 
periods of the AZIP are 
influenced by the Group's 
targeted product development 
cycle, reflecting the long-term 
investment horizons that  
are a feature of the industry. 
Dividend-based performance 
hurdles motivate the generation  
of returns for shareholders  
on a sustainable basis over  
an extended period of time.
The AZIP was approved by shareholders at the 
2010 AGM and provides for the grant of awards 
over Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
The AZIP is operated over a four year performance 
period and a subsequent four year holding period. 
Performance periods commence on 1 January  
in the year of the award. Holding periods 
commence at the end of the performance period 
and end eight years from 1 January in the year  
of the award.
In respect of any financial year of the Company, 
the maximum market value of shares that may,  
in theory, be put under an award under the AZIP 
is 500% of a participant's base salary (which 
converts into an expected value of 500%). The 
actual individual limits that apply under the  
AZIP, subject to this maximum, are set by the 
Remuneration Committee from time to time.
Clawback - the Remuneration Committee may 
claw back some or all of the shares that are the 
subject of a participant's award at any time during 
the performance or the holding period if, in the 
opinion of the Remuneration Committee (acting 
fairly and reasonably), this is warranted by 
underlying Company performance, the 
occurrence of an event that causes or is very likely 
to cause reputational damage to the Company  
or serious misconduct by the participant.
A combination of dividend and dividend cover 
hurdles, assessed over the relevant four year 
performance period.
More information about the AZIP's performance 
hurdles is set out on page 130.
Pension Provision of retirement benefits. Benchmarked against the relevant local 
employment market.

 In respect of long-term incentive awards, the current distribution between the PSP and the AZIP is in the ratio 75% to 25%. Corporate Governance | Directors' Remuneration Report
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 126
Performance evaluation process
AstraZeneca conducts an annual performance evaluation process for all of its executives. In the case of members of the Senior Executive 
Team, this is conducted by the CEO. In the case of the CEO, this is conducted by the Chairman of the Board. Recommendations are then 
made to the Remuneration Committee. Those reviews take place relative to Group and individual objectives which are set at the beginning 
of each year.
Service contracts
The notice periods and unexpired terms of Executive Directors' service contracts at 31 December 2012 are shown in the table below. 
Subject to the arrangements in respect of the first 12 months of Pascal Soriot's service, which are described below, either AstraZeneca  
or the Executive Director may terminate the service contract on 12 months' notice. It is the Remuneration Committee's intention that, in 
the event of early termination of an Executive Director's employment, any compensation payable under his/her service contract should  
not exceed the salary and benefits that would have been received had the contractual notice period been worked and this may be further 
reduced in line with the Executive Director's duty to mitigate losses.
None of the Executive Directors has any provision in their service contracts giving them a right to liquidated damages or an automatic 
entitlement to bonus for the duration of their notice period.

 The notice period in Mr Soriot's service contract is 24 months initially, which is reducing by one month for each month of service and will stabilise at a 12 month notice period.
Policy on external appointments and retention of fees
Subject to specific Board approval in each case, Executive Directors and other SET members may accept external appointments as 
non-executive directors of other companies, and retain any related fees paid to them, provided that such appointments are not 
considered by the Board to prevent, or reduce, the ability of the executive to perform their role within the Group to the required standard. 
Simon Lowth is a Non-Executive Director of Standard Chartered PLC. In respect of this position, he received fees of  130,000 for his 
services in 2012.
Considering the wider employee context
The Remuneration Committee sets overall remuneration policy and makes decisions about specific remuneration arrangements in the 
broader context of employee remuneration throughout the Group. The Remuneration Committee annually reviews Group remuneration 
data including ratios of average pay to senior executive pay; bonus data; gender and geographical data in relation to base salaries and 
variable compensation; and aggregate data about the shareholding levels of senior managers. In reviewing the base salaries of Executive 
Directors and SET members, the Remuneration Committee considers the overall level of any salary increases being awarded to 
employees across the Group in the relevant year.
Shareholder and broader context
In all aspects of its work, the Remuneration Committee considers both the external environment in which the Company operates and  
the guidance issued by organisations representing institutional shareholders. It consults the Company's largest investors on general and 
specific remuneration and provides an annual opportunity for representatives of those investors to meet the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee and other Remuneration Committee and Board members. The Remuneration Committee works with the Audit Committee  
to ensure that the Group's remuneration policies and practices achieve the right balance between appropriate incentives to reward good 
performance and managing risk in terms of employee behaviour and how the Company achieves its business objectives. The annual 
bonus plan, in which all employees participate, contains goals relating to the demonstration of commitment to integrity, with the aim  
of enhancing the Company's reputation and avoiding reputational damage. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 127

Implementation Report
Implementation of remuneration policy in 2012
Pascal Soriot
Mr Soriot joined AstraZeneca as CEO on 1 October. In establishing his remuneration arrangements, the Remuneration Committee  
sought to offer a package that was internationally competitive, but pay no more than was necessary. In doing so, to the extent possible, 
the Remuneration Committee put in place a framework that maintained broadly the same balance in terms of its constituent elements and 
overall quantum as for the previous CEO, which the Remuneration Committee considers to be right for AstraZeneca and its shareholders.
At the time of Mr Soriot's appointment as CEO, certain share awards and payments, which are described below, were negotiated and 
agreed. They were approved by the Remuneration Committee in order to compensate Mr Soriot for the forfeiture of unvested long-term 
incentive awards and forfeited 2012 bonus opportunity from his previous employer. The principle governing the decision of the 
Remuneration Committee was that the buyout should be implemented predominantly in shares of AstraZeneca in circumstances where 
the vesting and, in the case of the award under the AZIP , the holding period operate over several years. The unvested long-term incentive 
awards from Mr Soriot's previous employer were valued with the assistance of an independent third party, using its standard methodology 
for such work and, where relevant, taking into account the extent to which such awards might have been expected to vest.
General information about annual bonus outcomes for performance in 2012 can be found on page 129. In awarding Mr Soriot's bonus  
for 2012, the Remuneration Committee recognised the strong start he had made since becoming CEO and his positive impact on  
the organisation.
2012 Notes
Base salary  275,000 The annual rate of base salary for the CEO in 2012 was  1,100,000.
Mr Soriot was appointed as CEO with effect from 1 October.
Benefits  1,017,000 This sum is made up of:
 991,000 being cash paid to compensate Mr Soriot in respect of his forfeited bonus opportunity for 2012 from his previous 
employer, paid at his previous employer's target bonus rate and pro-rated from 1 January 2012 to 30 September.  
Mr Soriot is required to invest this sum, after payment of income tax, in AstraZeneca shares; and
 26,000 being remaining cash following selection of benefits within the Company's UK flexible benefits programme.
Annual bonus  335,000 Mr Soriot was awarded a bonus for performance during 2012 of 122% of base salary out of a maximum possible award of 180% 
of base salary (range 0% - 180% with a target annual bonus of 100%). This award was pro-rated from 1 October to 31 
December to reflect the date of Mr Soriot's appointment as CEO.
One-third of any pre-tax bonus must be deferred into Ordinary Shares or ADSs. These are held for three years before being 
released.
The bonus is not pensionable.
Award of 
restricted shares
1
 2,000,000 On 26 October, Mr Soriot was granted an award of 69,108 restricted Ordinary Shares at a price of 2894 pence per share  
by way of compensation for the loss of long-term incentives from his previous employer.
No performance conditions apply.
Vesting schedule for this award (subject to Mr Soriot's continued employment with the Company):
> 40% on 1 October 2013
> 30% on 1 October 2014
> 30% on 1 October 2015.
Pension  66,000 Cash payment equivalent to 24% of base salary (time pro-rated to take account of Mr Soriot's joining date in 2012) taken  
by Mr Soriot as a cash alternative to participation in a defined contribution pension scheme.
1
  In addition to the award of restricted shares, on 26 October, Mr Soriot was also granted an award of 69,108 Ordinary Shares at a price of 2894 pence per share under the AZIP (also by way of 
compensation for the loss of long-term incentives from his previous employer). This award is subject to a four year performance period (1 January 2012 to 31 December 2015) and a subsequent four 
year holding period (1 January 2016 to 31 December 2019). The performance hurdles that apply to this award are that the annual dividend per share paid to holders of Ordinary Shares must increase 
from $2.80 over the four year performance period ($2.80 being the full-year dividend for 2011), and that dividend cover over the same period (based on Reported earnings before restructuring costs) 
does not fall below 1.5 times. Corporate Governance | Directors' Remuneration Report

Simon Lowth
During 2012, at a time of considerable change within the Group, Mr Lowth served as Interim CEO for the period 1 June to 30 September, 
reverting to his previous role as CFO on 1 October.
To reflect his additional responsibilities during his tenure as Interim CEO, he was awarded a temporary increase in base salary. General 
information about annual bonus outcomes for performance in 2012 can be found on the page opposite. The Remuneration Committee 
also recognised Mr Lowth's excellent performance as Interim CEO, and his strong support to Mr Soriot in his new position as CEO, in 
determining the quantum of his annual bonus award.
2012 Notes
Base salary  740,000 Base salary for the CFO in 2012 was  660,000.
Temporary base salary increase effective from June to September inclusive (period as Interim CEO) was  20,000 gross per 
month creating an annualised base pay figure of  900,000. This compares with the annualised salary of the outgoing CEO  
of  997,223. This temporary base salary increase was not pensionable.
Benefits  103,000 This sum is made up of:
 47,000 being cash paid in respect of dividends accrued on Ordinary Shares which vested in 2012, having been deferred  
in 2009 in respect of Mr Lowth's annual bonus awarded for performance in 2008; 
 50,000 being remaining cash following selection of benefits within the Company's UK flexible benefits programme;  
and  6,000 for other benefits, including healthcare insurance.
Annual bonus (a)  554,000

and US defined contribution arrangements. He had an accrued pension at 30 June of $1,584,000 ( 1,000,000) per annum 
from his defined benefit arrangements. Full details can be found on page 131.

Strategy Performance Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Overview
Variable elements of the CEO's and CFO's remuneration in 2012 - additional disclosures
Annual bonus outcomes for performance in 2012
For Executive Directors, the principal drivers of annual bonus opportunity are EPS (27% weighting), cash flow (9% weighting), and 
scorecards (Group and SET area, 64% weighting). For the CEO, the average of all SET area scorecards is used to create an aggregate 
scorecard weighting. For the CFO, the average of Finance and Strategic Partnering and Business Development scorecards is used. 
Reward driven by EPS and cash flow performance depends on EPS and cash flow outcomes versus targets set at the beginning of each 
year. Reward driven by the scorecards depends on performance outcomes relative to goals in the areas of Values, Pipeline and People 
set at the beginning of each year. At constant exchange rates, there were declines in revenue, Core operating profit and EPS versus prior 
year. However, the Core EPS outcome and the cash flow outcome both exceeded the target set at the beginning of 2012. That element  
of the bonus payout which was driven by EPS and cash flow performance therefore exceeded target. In respect of the scorecards, a 
number of factors were taken into consideration. These include the supply problems described elsewhere in this Remuneration Report 
and the slower than expected uptake of Brilinta/Brilique. But they also include the strengthening of the pipeline through the acquisition  
of Ardea, the collaboration with Amgen, and the extension of our diabetes alliance with BMS through the inclusion of the Amylin product 
portfolio. Both Forxiga and Zinforo were launched in Europe, and we had a successful launch of Nexium in Japan. These factors 
collectively drove a score relative to scorecard performance of slightly below target. 
The outturn is that the total variable short-term compensation of Executive Directors and other SET members in 2012 fell relative to the 
equivalent number in 2011. 
The Remuneration Committee decided that Mr Soriot's annual bonus should amount to 122% of base salary, representing 68% of the 
potential maximum. The Remuneration Committee decided that Mr Lowth's annual bonus should be 140% of base salary, representing 
86% of the potential maximum. 
Mr Brennan informed the Remuneration Committee that he did not wish to be considered for a bonus in respect of that part of 2012 
during which he was CEO and the Remuneration Committee determined that no such bonus would be awarded.
Annual bonus deferral
Part of the annual bonus of Executive Directors and other SET members is deferred into shares, helping to align senior executives' 
interests with those of shareholders. The proportion currently deferred into shares is one-third of the pre-tax annual bonus for Executive 
Directors and one-sixth for other SET members. The shares are acquired on the open market at the prevailing market price and held  
for a period of three years from the date of acquisition before being delivered to individual Executive Directors and other SET members.
Performance measures under the PSP
The vesting of PSP awards is contingent on performance against specified performance measures over the relevant three year 
performance period and continued employment with the Group. Equal weighting is given to the two performance measures used:  
relative TSR and cumulative free cash flow.
Relative TSR - Fifty percent of the award is based on the Group's relative TSR performance against a predetermined peer group of 
global pharmaceutical companies. The peer group is: Abbott, BMS, Eli Lilly & Company, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novartis, 
Pfizer, Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Sanofi-Aventis. TSR measures share price growth, and dividends reinvested in respect of a notional 
number of shares from the beginning of the relevant performance period to the end of it, and ranks the companies in the peer group  
by reference to their TSR achieved over that period. The rank which the Company's TSR achieves over the performance period will 
determine how many shares will vest under the relevant PSP award. Payouts against performance in relation to TSR for PSP awards are 
expressed as a percentage of the maximum award currently payable, shown within a range of 0% to 100%, as set out in the table below.
TSR ranking of the Company % of the maximum PSP award that vests
Below median 0%
Median 25%
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata
Upper quartile 75%
Significantly above upper quartile 100%
Although 100% of the maximum award may vest at the Remuneration Committee's discretion if the Company's TSR performance  
is substantially better than that of the upper quartile of the comparator group, the Company would need to have sustained a level of 
performance significantly in excess of upper quartile over a period of years for the Remuneration Committee to be satisfied that the 
vesting of awards at this level was warranted.
In addition to the TSR performance target being met for each PSP award, the Remuneration Committee has to satisfy itself that 
achievement of the TSR performance target is an appropriate reflection of the Group's underlying financial performance. It has the 
discretion to prevent PSP awards from vesting or only allow them to vest partially where this, in the judgement of the Remuneration 
Committee, is warranted.
The TSR graphs on page 134 show, for each PSP award, how the Company's TSR performance has compared with the TSR for the 
companies in the comparator group from the first day of the relevant performance period to 31 December 2012, and how the Company 
ranks against those other peer companies on this basis.
Cumulative free cash flow - Fifty percent of the award vests subject to the achievement of the free cash flow performance measure, 
which operates as a cumulative cash flow target over the same three year performance period as the TSR performance measure. The 
measure for the cash flow target is net cash flow (before distributions) (subject to any further adjustments the Remuneration Committee 
chooses to make at its discretion and thus referred to as  adjusted cumulative cash flow') and the level of vesting is based on a sliding 
scale between a threshold cash flow target and an upper target. Vesting levels in relation to the threshold target and the upper target  
are shown in the table overleaf. Corporate Governance | Directors' Remuneration Report
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 130
Adjusted cumulative cash flow - all PSP awards made before 2012 Adjusted cumulative cash flow - PSP awards made in 2012 % of the maximum PSP award that vests
Less than $16 billion Less than $12 billion 0%
$16 billion $12 billion 25%
Between $16 billion and $23 billion Between $12 billion and $18 billion Pro rata
$23 billion and above $18 billion and above 100%
Cumulative cash flow is considered to be the most appropriate measure of cash flow performance because it relates to the residual cash 
available to finance additional investment in specific business needs, debt repayments and our distribution policy. The cash flow measure 
encompasses a number of important elements of operational and financial performance and helps to align executives' rewards with 
shareholder value creation. The level of vesting of this element is based on a sliding scale against a target that is intended to represent  
a significant challenge for the business. It is intended that the Remuneration Committee should have the discretion to adjust, but on  
an exceptional basis only, the free cash flow target during the performance period for material factors that might otherwise distort the 
performance measure in either direction. This allows performance to be assessed against targets that have been set on a consistent 
basis. For example, adjustments may be required to reflect exchange rate movements, significant acquisitions or divestments, and major 
legal and taxation settlements. Any major adjustments to the calculation are disclosed to shareholders. There is no retesting of 
performance. 
Vesting of share awards made in 2010 under the PSP
In 2012, the TSR ranking of the Company was below median and therefore none of the award will vest in respect of that element of the 
performance measure. Fifty percent of the PSP award is based on free cash flow and in 2012 the Company achieved 95% of the free 
cash flow performance measure. The PSP share awards made in 2010 in respect of the 2010 to 2012 performance period will therefore 
vest at 47% for SET members, including Simon Lowth but excluding Pascal Soriot who does not hold any 2010 PSP awards. For the 
former CEO, David Brennan, vesting of his 2010 PSP awards will be pro-rated from 7 May 2010 to 30 June 2012 to reflect the period  
of his employment since the award was granted.

Committee determined should be forfeited. 
Statement of Executive Directors' shareholdings

Pension arrangements 
Pascal Soriot and Simon Lowth
Pascal Soriot and Simon Lowth are eligible to join the AstraZeneca Group Self Invested Personal Pension (UK Defined Contribution  
Plan (UK DCP)) at a Company contribution rate of 24% of annual base salary or, alternatively, to take the Company contribution as a  
cash allowance. Since joining AstraZeneca, Mr Lowth has elected to take the cash allowance in lieu of a pension, which during 2012 
amounted to  158,000 ($251,000) (201 1:  153,000 ($245,000)). In respect of 2012, Mr Soriot made a similar election, which amounted  
to  66,000 ($105,000).
In the event of a senior employee in the UK DCP (including one who has taken the alternative cash allowance) becoming incapacitated, 
permanent health insurance cover provides continuation of a proportion of salary, subject to the satisfaction of certain medical criteria. In the 
event of death prior to retirement, dependants are entitled to a lump sum secured from a multiple of 10 times salary, capped at  4.3 million.
David Brennan
David Brennan is a member of the AstraZeneca US Defined Benefit Pension Plan (US DBP). Benefits for members of the US DBP are 
delivered on a tax-qualified basis, with accrued benefits that exceed specific limits under the US DBP's formula and the US Tax Code 
being delivered through a supplementary, non-qualified plan. The normal pension age under the US DBP is 65. However, on his 
retirement in 2012, Mr Brennan was eligible to take a pension or lump sum equivalent based on accrued service and final pensionable  
pay (ie without actuarial reduction) due to his satisfaction of a condition in the pension plan relating to combined age and service 
exceeding 85 years. 
Mr Brennan's participation in the US DBP was subject to a service cap at 35 years' service, which was attained during his tenure  
as CEO and therefore service beyond 35 years is not shown in the table below. During his tenure as a Director, bonus payments were 
removed from the calculation of his pensionable pay under the US DBP .
Pension is payable to Mr Brennan in US dollars. For ease of understanding, the table below has been presented in both pounds sterling 
and US dollars using the exchange rates for 2012 set out on page 133. Transfer values are calculated to be consistent with the value of the 
lump sum distribution equivalent to his deferred accrued pension annually.

 Mr Brennan's employment with AstraZeneca ended on 30 June 2012.
In addition to the US DBP , Mr Brennan (as a US citizen) was a contributing member of the US 401(k) savings plan. He also participated  
in AstraZeneca's Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (EDCP) which is operated as a supplemental non-qualified plan in respect  
of US employees should annual contributions exceed the limit applicable to contributions under the qualified 401(k) plan. During 2012, 
total employer matching contributions of $47 ,000 ( 30,000) (2011: $96,000 ( 60,000)) were made to his 401(k) plan and EDCP . Member 
contributions of  224,000 ($355,000) were paid through salary sacrifice into the plans. Corporate Governance | Directors' Remuneration Report

Summary of other share plans 
AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan
The AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan (GRSP) was introduced in 2010 and provides for the grant of restricted stock awards  
over the Company's Ordinary Shares or ADSs. The GRSP is operated for below SET-level employees only. Typically, awards are made  
in March each year and, in relation, for example, to new appointments or promotions, in August. Awards under the GRSP do not involve 
the issue or allotment of new Ordinary Shares or ADSs but rely instead on the market purchase of Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
AstraZeneca Restricted Share Plan
The AstraZeneca Restricted Share Plan (RSP) was introduced in 2008 and provides for the granting of restricted share awards to key 
employees, excluding Executive Directors. Awards are made on an ad hoc basis with variable vesting dates. The RSP was used in 2012 
to make awards (totalling an aggregate of 643,000 Ordinary Shares under the plan for the calendar year 2012) to a number of key senior 
executives in specific situations considered by the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for 
agreeing any awards under the RSP and for setting the policy for the way in which the RSP operates. Awards under the RSP do not 
involve the issue or allotment of new Ordinary Shares or ADSs but rely instead on the market purchase of Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
AstraZeneca Share Option Plan
The AstraZeneca Share Option Plan (SOP) expired in May 2010. Details of outstanding options granted to Executive Directors are shown 
in the table on page 137 . The Remuneration Committee imposed performance conditions in respect of the exercise of such options by 
SET members (including the Executive Directors) which, in the view of the Remuneration Committee, were considered appropriately 
stretching. In order for options to vest, the EPS of the Group must increase at least in line with the UK Retail Prices Index plus 5% per 
annum on average, over a three year period, the base figure being the EPS for the financial year preceding the date of grant, with no 
retesting. In addition, since the review of executive remuneration in 2004, the Remuneration Committee has included a condition that, if an 
event occurs which causes material reputational damage to the Company, such that it is not appropriate for the options to vest and 
become exercisable, the Remuneration Committee can make a determination to reflect this. No such determination was made in 2012.
Other plans
In addition to the plans described above, the AstraZeneca Savings-Related Share Option Plan and the AstraZeneca All-Employee Share 
Plan are operated in the UK, both of which are HM Revenue & Customs approved plans. Executive Directors and certain other SET 
members are eligible to participate in these plans.
Dilution under share plans
Other than the AstraZeneca Savings-Related Share Option Plan and the AstraZeneca All-Employee Share Plan, which operate in the  
UK only, and the SOP , none of AstraZeneca's share plans has a dilutive effect because they do not involve the issue or allotment of new 
Ordinary Shares or ADSs but rely instead on the market purchase of Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
Chairman
The Remuneration Committee determines the terms of service, including remuneration, of the Chairman. The annual Board fees payable 
to the Chairman are set out in the table below. In addition to the Chairman's fee, a proportion of the office costs of the Chairman are 
reimbursed; the sum paid in this respect in 2012 is set out in the Directors' emoluments section below. The Chairman receives no 
additional fee or allowance for Remuneration Committee membership. The Chairman does not participate in the Group's incentive plans 
or pension or healthcare arrangements.
Non-Executive Directors
None of the Non-Executive Directors has a service contract but all have letters of appointment. In accordance with the Articles, following 
their appointment, Directors must retire at each AGM and may present themselves for election or re-election. None of the Non-Executive 
Directors has any provision in their letter of appointment giving them a right to compensation payable upon early termination of their 
appointment. They are not eligible for performance-related bonuses or the grant of share awards or options. No pension contributions  
are made on their behalf.
The annual Board fees applicable to Non-Executive Directors are set out below. 
Under the Articles, all Directors must, within two months of their appointment, acquire a beneficial interest in at least 500 shares.  
In addition to this mandatory shareholding requirement, the Board encourages each Non-Executive Director to build up, over time,  
a shareholding in the Company with a value approximately equivalent to the basic annual fee for a Non-Executive Director ( 75,000)  
or, in the case of the Chairman, approximately equivalent to his annual fee ( 500,000).

Directors' emoluments in 2012
The aggregate remuneration, excluding pension contributions and the value of shares under option and shares subject to share awards, 
paid to or accrued for all Directors for services in all capacities during the year ended 31 December 2012 was  7 ,308,000 ($11,572,000). 
The remuneration of individual Directors is set out in the Directors' remuneration tables opposite in pounds sterling and US dollars.

Total shareholder return
The Regulations require the inclusion of a graph showing TSR over a five year period in respect of a holding of the Company's shares, 
plotted against TSR in respect of a hypothetical holding of shares of a similar kind and number by reference to which a broad equity 
market index is calculated. The Company is a member of the FTSE 100 Index and consequently, for the purposes of this graph, which  
is set out above, we have selected the FTSE 100 Index as the appropriate index. This graph is re-based to 100 at the start of the rolling 
five year period. We have also included a  Pharmaceutical peers (average)', which reflects the TSR of the same comparator group used  
for the PSP graphs above.
The PSP requires that the TSR in respect of a holding of the Company's shares over the relevant performance period be compared with 
the TSR of a peer group of pharmaceutical companies (as described on page 129). The graphs above show how the Company's TSR 
performance has compared with the TSR for the relevant companies in the comparator group from the first day in the relevant three year 
performance period in respect of each PSP award to 31 December 2012 and how the Company ranks against those other companies  
on this basis.
To alleviate any short-term volatility, the return index is averaged in the TSR calculations for each company over the three months prior  
to the start of the relevant performance period (as stipulated in the PSP) and, for the purposes of the graphs above, over the last three 
months of 2012.
Directors' interests in shares
Beneficial interests
The table opposite shows any change in the interests of the Directors (including the interests of their Connected Persons, as such term is 
defined in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in Ordinary Shares from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012 or on the date of 
resignation of such Director (if earlier). All such interests were beneficial except as otherwise stated. However, interests in Ordinary Shares 
or ADSs that are the subject of PSP awards and/or AZIP awards, as well as Ordinary Shares or ADSs that are deferred under the annual 
bonus plan discussed in this Remuneration Report, are not included in the Directors' interests in shares table opposite but are shown in 
the relevant tables from page 135. No Director or senior executive beneficially owns, or has options over, 1% or more of the issued share 
capital of the Company, nor do they have different voting rights from other shareholders. None of the Directors has a beneficial interest in 
the shares of any of the Company's subsidiaries. Between 31 December 2012 and 31 January 2013, there was no change in the interests 
in Ordinary Shares shown in the table opposite.

Unitised stock plans
David Brennan, in common with other participating executives in the US, has interests in the following plans which were awarded to him 
prior to him becoming CEO: the AstraZeneca Executive Deferral Plan, the AstraZeneca Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and the 
AstraZeneca Savings and Security Plan. These are unitised stock plans into which the value of certain previous share incentive awards 
has been deferred and are not incentive awards in their own right. Participants hold units in each plan, which represent a long-term  
equity interest in the Company. A unit comprises part cash and part ADSs. The overall unit value can be determined daily by taking  
the market value of the underlying ADSs and adding the cash position. The ADSs held within these units carry both voting and dividend 
rights. David Brennan is deemed to have a notional beneficial interest in these ADSs, calculated by reference to the fund value and the 
closing price of ADSs. Therefore, the number of ADSs in which a notional beneficial interest arises can vary daily as a consequence  
of stock price movements.

Our presence contributes to the economic development of the communities in which  
we work, building skills in these communities through local employment, contributions 
through wages and taxes, as well as capacity building through local procurement and 
collaborations with local partners.
For example, in Russia we were the first pharmaceuticals multinational to announce an investment in full-cycle manufacturing. The factory, 
currently being built and due to open in the Kaluga region in 2014, will manufacture a range of AstraZeneca's medicines. We are also 
committed to sharing our global R&D expertise with the Russian scientific community through research collaborations, support programmes 
and clinical trials. In support of this commitment, we opened our first Predictive Science Centre in Russia in St. Petersburg in 2012.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 140
The Directors assessed the effectiveness of AstraZeneca's internal 
control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2012 based on 
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated 
Framework. Based on this assessment, the Directors believe that, 
as at 31 December 2012, the internal control over financial reporting 
is effective based on those criteria.
KPMG Audit Plc, an independent registered public accounting 
firm, has audited the effectiveness of internal control over financial 
reporting as at 31 December 2012 and, as explained on page 141, 
has issued an unqualified report thereon.
The Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
adequate internal control over financial reporting. AstraZeneca's 
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide 
reasonable assurance over the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles.
Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting 
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any 
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the 
risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes 
in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate.
Directors' Responsibilities for, and Report on,  
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company's 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors' Report, Directors' 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement 
that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company's 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Directors' responsibility statement pursuant to DTR 4
The Directors confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 > The Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole.
 > The Directors' Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the issuer 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.
On behalf of the Board of Directors on 31 January 2013
Pascal Soriot 
Director
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
Form 20-F Information and the Group and Parent Company Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group Financial Statements 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable 
law and have elected to prepare the Parent Company Financial 
Statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and 
applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and 
of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group 
and Parent Company Financial Statements, the Directors are 
required to:
 > select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently
 > make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent
 > for the Group Financial Statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU
 > for the Parent Company Financial Statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the Parent Company Financial Statements
 > prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Parent Company will continue in business.
