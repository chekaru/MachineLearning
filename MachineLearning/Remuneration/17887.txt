TSR and free cash flow. The Remuneration 
Committee determined that two additional 
measures should be added. First, the 
introduction of an Achieve Scientific 
Leadership measure, which, for awards 
granted in 2013, comprised: new molecular 
entities (NME) generation; major life-cycle 
management approvals; volume of NMEs  
in Phase III; peak-year sales to track the 
value of pipeline output; and Phase II starts. 
Second, we added a Return to Growth 
measure, which, for awards granted in 2013, 
was based on quantitative medium-term 
sales targets relating to the five growth 
platforms described in the strategy: Brilinta; 
diabetes; respiratory; Emerging Markets; 
and Japan. 
The Remuneration Committee also 
considered the performance conditions 
attaching to the AstraZeneca Incentive Plan 
(AZIP). For 2013, the two AZIP four-year 
performance hurdles were payment of a 
dividend equal to, or greater than, $2.80; 
and a dividend cover floor of 1.5 times EPS 
calculated on a Core basis. We believe that 
Core EPS provides the best indicator of 
cash cover for the dividend. The AZIP award 
is structured such that the performance test 
will be failed if either the dividend per share 
falls below $2.80, or if the dividend cover 
falls below the floor, in any of the years of 
the performance period.
When Pascal Soriot joined us, he forfeited  
a number of LTI awards made to him by  
his previous employer. The value of these 
awards was carefully quantified and an AZIP 
award made on his recruitment in October 
2012 formed part of the compensation for 
this loss. This AZIP award was underpinned 
by the  old' performance measures. The 
Remuneration Committee wished to align 
Mr Soriot's LTI arrangements to the new 
strategy. Therefore, the Remuneration 
Committee required Mr Soriot to forfeit his 
2012 AZIP award and substituted it with a 
2013 AZIP award based on the new metrics 
aligned to the new strategy, as described 
above. The 2013 award was over the same 
(target being 250%). You will see in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration (the 
Implementation Report) that his base pay 
has been increased (effective 1 January 
2014) by 3% in conformity with the base pay 
increase for the UK employee population; 
and that his defined contribution pension 
funding has been increased from 24% of 
base pay per annum to 30% of base pay 
per annum, which we believe to be more in 
line with current market practice for FTSE30 
CEOs. We have granted Marc Dunoyer an 
annualised bonus award for 2013 of 129% 
of base salary in respect of his service as 
CFO (on appointment to which he became 
an Executive Director). He has been granted 
an at-target LTI award of 200% of base 
salary. There is no change to his base salary 
or to his pension entitlement for 2014.
Whilst the outlook for 2014 in terms of 
scientific progress and pipeline strength  
is more promising, the commercial and 
financial challenges facing the business  
are likely to persist. These features have 
informed our setting of targets for 2014. 
The Remuneration Committee recognises 
the need to be thoughtful in structuring 
performance measures so that they are 
sufficiently stretching to stimulate value 
creation for shareholders, but not so 
stretching that incentivisation is weakened.
Key matters in 2013
In 2013, in light of our new strategy focused 
on scientific leadership and returning to 
growth, the Remuneration Committee  
took the opportunity to review the LTI 
arrangements for the Company's senior 
executives. At the AGM in April 2013,  
and following consultation with our major 
shareholders, I shared with you changes to 
AstraZeneca's LTI programme, which were 
developed in order more closely to align 
performance measures to the Company's 
strategy, such that employees are rewarded 
for the delivery of the Company's key 
strategic priorities. Prior to these changes, 
the Performance Share Plan (PSP) operated 
with two equal performance measures:  
Dear shareholder
We have sought, in our 
deliberations and judgements 
throughout 2013, to take  
account of both the underlying 
performance of AstraZeneca  
and the experience of our 
shareholders. 
In March 2013, our new CEO, Pascal Soriot, 
set out his strategy for achieving scientific 
leadership and returning the Company to 
growth. During 2013, a number of key 
strategic milestones were achieved. The 
acquisition of companies such as Pearl 
Therapeutics, Omthera, Amplimmune and 
Spirogen has bolstered our pipeline and 
strengthened our capabilities in each of our 
core therapy areas. They have also brought 
with them leading scientific innovations and 
talented scientists. Licensing agreements 
and strategic collaborations, such as our 
collaboration with FibroGen, have created 
further additions to the late-stage portfolio. 
However, we recognise that these 
achievements must be considered in the 
context of financial performance in 2013 
below that of 2011 and 2012. Whilst there 
has been growth across our five key 
commercial platforms, revenue and Core 
operating profit have declined with the loss 
of exclusivity on some of our principal 
marketed products. As expected, this has 
resulted in a fall in Core EPS. Our short-term 
TSR performance, however, has improved 
(including into 2014). 
How has this performance fed through  
into remuneration outcomes for the 
Executive Directors? We believe that  
the new leadership team is having a 
substantial impact on the actual and  
future performance of the Company. The 
Remuneration Committee awarded Pascal 
Soriot an annual bonus for 2013 of 170% of 
base salary and an above target Long-Term 
Incentive (LTI) award of 285% of base salary

number of shares as the original award,  
and the four-year performance period and 
four-year holding period will continue to 
apply, which will result in Mr Soriot's new 
award vesting one year later than the 
original award.
Looking forward
At our AGM in April 2014, we will seek  
your approval to renew the PSP plan rules, 
which expire in April 2015. The original plan 
rules will remain substantially unchanged, 
except for three important amendments 
which we hope will be welcomed by our 
shareholders. First, we propose to remove 
the Remuneration Committee's discretion  
to vest an award at above 100%. Second, 
we will introduce a two-year holding period 
after the three-year performance period; this 
will apply to Executive Directors only. This is 
in direct response to growing shareholder 
appetite for LTI plans with a longer life. 
Finally, we will include malus (in relation to 
unvested awards) and clawback (in relation 
to vested awards) provisions which can be 
exercised in circumstances that result in 
significant reputational damage to the 
Company, financial mismanagement or 
serious personal misconduct. We will  
also add the same malus and clawback 
provisions to the other AstraZeneca LTI  
plan rules and the Deferred Bonus Plan.
Senior leadership changes
Given the senior leadership changes during 
2013, the Remuneration Committee gave 
careful consideration to a number of related 
remuneration matters; in particular, the 
departure of Simon Lowth as CFO and  
the appointment of Marc Dunoyer as his 
successor. As Mr Lowth resigned, he  
will not be paid a bonus for 2013 and his 
outstanding LTI awards were forfeited in  
full. He was an extremely talented CFO,  
and provided strong leadership through 
uncertain times as Interim CEO. He gave 
excellent support to Pascal Soriot when  
he was first appointed as CEO, and the 
Remuneration Committee felt it appropriate 
to exercise its discretion to allow Mr Lowth 
to retain his Deferred Bonus Plan shares  
as these related to strong performance  
in prior years. Marc Dunoyer joined 
AstraZeneca in June 2013 as EVP , GPPS, 
and was appointed CFO in November 2013. 
Mr Dunoyer's compensation arrangements 
are in line with the market, and his ongoing 
remuneration arrangements are somewhat 
below those of his predecessor. 
Shareholder engagement
In October 2013, new directors' reporting 
regulations came into effect, requiring  
all UK listed companies to publish their 
remuneration policy (the Remuneration 
Policy Report) (page 114) and to explain  
how they implemented that policy in the 
Implementation Report (page 104). At the 
Company's 2014 AGM, you will have a 
binding vote on the Remuneration Policy 
Report and an advisory vote on the 
Implementation Report. 
As a matter of course, we have regular 
dialogue with a number of our major 
shareholders, which in December 2013 
included a consultation meeting attended by 
the Chairman of the Board, Leif Johansson; 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee,  
Rudy Markham; and me. At this meeting,  
we outlined our approach to some of the 
more substantive components of our 
Remuneration Policy. This year, our 
shareholders' views and insights have been 
at the forefront of our minds as we have 
considered and proposed amendments  
to our existing remuneration policy in order 
to enable us to continue to attract and retain 
the best people. It is proposed that our new 
remuneration policy will come into effect  
on 1 January 2015 and we intend that it  
will remain in place for three years. We 
recognise the desire of our shareholders  
for transparency, including in how we 
determine, quantify and assess the outcome 
relative to performance measures and 
targets. However, we also recognise the 
targets' commercial sensitivity. Accordingly, 
we have disclosed in the Implementation 
Report a level of detail that provides 
transparency about AstraZeneca's 
approach to remuneration without detailing 
information we consider commercially 
sensitive. Generally, our approach is to 
disclose performance measures and 
weightings in advance (ie for the current 
performance period) and outcomes  
against those targets in arrears (ie for  
the past performance period). While our 
Remuneration Policy will not come into 
effect until 1 January 2015, the 
Remuneration Committee intends to 
operate substantially within the policy  
during 2014.
As you read our Implementation and 
Remuneration Policy Reports, I hope you 
will see that, in the judgements we have 
made during the year, the Remuneration 
Committee has endeavoured to support  
the Company by incentivising the senior 
leaders, and all our employees, to focus  
on the delivery of our strategy, while also 
being careful to protect the interests of 
shareholders. The Remuneration Committee 
seeks to ensure that, on the one hand, 
reward outcomes are not purely mechanistic; 
but on the other, that the exercise of its 
discretion is not seen by employees to be 
arbitrary or unfair. Our Remuneration Policy, 
for which we seek your support through  
the binding vote, is consistent with this 
approach. We see remuneration resource 
as your resource and we attempt to spend  
it wisely and proportionately to increase the 
value of your shareholdings in AstraZeneca. 
We greatly value our ongoing dialogue with 
our shareholders and we welcome your 
feedback on this Directors' Remuneration 
Report. 
Yours sincerely
John Varley 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
 The Remuneration Committee's core 
responsibility is to develop and execute

Independent Adviser to the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee retains Deloitte, represented by Carol Arrowsmith and Nicki Demby, who report directly to the 
Remuneration Committee and its Chairman and who provided independent advice on various matters considered by the Remuneration 
Committee in 2013. This service was provided to the Remuneration Committee on a time spent basis at a cost to the Company of 
 145,970 (including VAT). During the year, Deloitte also provided taxation advice and other specific non-audit services to the Group.  
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were no conflicts. Deloitte is a member 
of the Remuneration Consultants' Group, which is responsible for the stewardship and development of the voluntary code of conduct in 
relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The principles on which the code is based are transparency, integrity, objectivity, 
competence, due care and confidentiality. Deloitte adheres to the code.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee conducted a tender process, inviting five specialist firms to apply for the role of 
independent adviser to the Committee. The tender process, which involved interviews with both the Company's management and  
the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, concluded with the reappointment of Deloitte as the independent adviser.

  Mr Soriot was appointed as CEO with effect from 1 October 2012, with an annual rate of base salary in 2012 and 2013 of  1,100,000. Mr Dunoyer was appointed as CFO with effect from 1 November 
2013, with an annualised base salary of  680,000. The base salary for Mr Lowth's position as CFO in 2013 increased from  660,000 to  710,000 with effect from 1 April 2013. Mr Lowth ceased to be 
a Director on 31 October 2013. Mr Lowth received a temporary base salary increase of  20,000 gross per month effective from June to September 2012 inclusive during his period as Interim CEO 
creating an annualised base pay figure of  900,000. This temporary base salary increase was not pensionable.

   Executive Directors may select benefits within the Company's UK Flexible Benefits Programme or can select to take all, or any remaining allowance after the selection of benefits, in cash. In 2013,  
the Executive Directors principally took the allowance in cash ( 102,000 in respect of Mr Soriot,  9,000 in respect of Mr Dunoyer, and  44,000 in respect of Mr Lowth) and selected other benefits 
including healthcare insurance, death-in-service provision and tax preparation advice.
3
  One-third of the pre-tax bonus is deferred into Ordinary Shares. These will be held for three years before being released, subject to continued employment. The bonus is not pensionable.
4
  For Mr Lowth, for 2012, this sum is made up of: a revised sum of  816,000 being the market value of shares on the date of vesting in March 2013 in respect of the 2010 PSP award (three-year 
performance period 2010-2012) which, using an estimated market value based on the London Stock Exchange closing price on 30 January 2013, was reported as  771,000 in our 2012 Directors' 
Remuneration Report;  126,000 being cash paid on the vesting of this PSP award in respect of dividends accrued; and  359,000 being the intrinsic gain on share options awarded in 2009 on the 
date of vesting in March 2012.
5
  Equivalent to 24% of base salary, taken as a cash alternative to participation in a defined contribution pension scheme.
6
  For Mr Soriot, for 2012, this sum is made up of:  991,000 being cash paid to compensate Mr Soriot in respect of his forfeited bonus opportunity for 2012 from his previous employer, paid at his 
previous employer's target bonus rate and pro-rated from 1 January 2012 to 30 September 2012. Mr Soriot was required to invest this sum, after payment of income tax, in AstraZeneca shares;  
and an award of  2,000,000 representing the value of an award of 69,108 restricted Ordinary Shares at a price of 2894 pence per share by way of compensation for the loss of LTIs from his previous 
employer. 27,644 shares representing 40% of the award vested on 31 October 2013 in accordance with the vesting schedule, and the remaining 60% of the award will vest in equal proportions 
(subject to the Company's closed trading periods) on 1 October 2014 and 1 October 2015. The value and structure of the restricted share award mirrors the value and structure of the award that  
Mr Soriot forfeited on his departure from his former employer. Accordingly, no performance conditions apply to the restricted share award made to Mr Soriot on his recruitment.

Additional notes to the Directors' single total figure remuneration table
Annual bonus
For 2013, the principal drivers of annual bonus opportunity were measures for Achieve Scientific Leadership (30%), Return to Growth 
(30%) and Achieve Group Financial Targets (40%), together with individual performance, details of which are set out below. The CEO  
had a target annual bonus of 100% of base salary (range 0-180%) and the CFO had a target annual bonus of 90% of base salary  
(range 0-150%).
One-third of the pre-tax bonuses earned for the year will be deferred into Ordinary Shares which will vest three years from the date of 
deferral, subject to continued employment.
The performance measures for the annual bonus opportunity, the weighting, actual performance during the year and level of award are 
detailed in the tables below.
The precise targets or target ranges set at the beginning of the performance period are closely aligned to the Company's strategic 
priorities and, in the judgement of the Board, disclosure of these would compromise the Company's competitive position versus its peers 
and therefore be prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its shareholders. As the annual bonus and PSP performance measures 
are indicators of the Company's longer-term strategic priorities, we believe that the targets/target ranges are and will remain commercially 
sensitive. Our approach, therefore, is to disclose performance measures and weightings in advance (ie for the current performance 
period) and performance outcomes against those measures in arrears (ie for the past performance period) with an explanation of the 
reward consequences for the Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee exercises its discretion in judging the annual bonus award for an individual Executive Director, taking into 
account Group and individual performance against targets. In 2013, the Remuneration Committee determined that Mr Soriot's annual 
bonus should amount to 170% of base salary, representing 94% of the potential maximum. The Remuneration Committee determined 
that Mr Dunoyer's bonus should amount to 129% of base salary on an annualised basis, representing 86% of the potential maximum.  
The Remuneration Committee's decisions recognise the impact the new leadership team is having on actual and future performance  
of the Company, including the outcome of the 2013 Group scorecard.

Summary of 
performance 
measures  
and targets
A combination of measures focused on our scientific, commercial and financial performance assessed over the relevant three-year performance 
period:
 > Twenty five percent of the award is based on the relative TSR performance of the Company against a predetermined peer group of global 
pharmaceutical companies. More information about the TSR performance of the Company, including the Company's peer group, is set out in 
the Total shareholder return section from page 110.
 > Twenty five percent of the award is based on the achievement of a cumulative free cash flow target.
 > Twenty five percent of the award is based on Achieve Scientific Leadership measures covering five areas: an NME target, which reflects the 
Company's ability to deliver innovation to the market; major life-cycle management approvals, which represent a good proxy for near-to-mid 
term growth; the volume of NMEs in Phase III and their registration; a target for peak-year sales, to track the value of pipeline output; and 
delivery from our research and early development organisation, assessed by Phase II starts.
 > Twenty five percent of the award is based on Return to Growth measures based on quantitative sales targets relating to the Company's five 
growth platforms: Brilinta, diabetes, respiratory, Emerging Markets, and Japan.
The precise targets or target ranges set at the beginning of the performance period are closely aligned to the Company's strategic priorities  
and, in the judgement of the Board, disclosure of certain of these may compromise the Company's competitive position versus its peers  
and therefore be prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its shareholders. As the PSP performance measures are an indicator of the 
Company's longer-term strategic priorities, we believe that these targets/target ranges are and will remain commercially sensitive. 
More information about the PSP's performance measures is set out on page 118 of the Remuneration Policy Report.

Description  
of interest
The AZIP provides for the grant of awards over Ordinary Shares or ADSs. The vesting date is the eighth anniversary of the start of the performance 
period (being 1 January in any given year), subject to performance and continued employment.
Basis of award The award comprises:
 > Mr Soriot's regular 2013 award, with a face 
value of 62.5% of base salary
 > a previously announced award which replaces 
that originally made when Mr Soriot joined the 
Company in October 2012. 
The forfeiture and replacement of the AZIP  
award was determined by the Remuneration 
Committee to be in the interests of shareholders 
as it more closely aligns Mr Soriot's LTI 
arrangements to the strategy announced by  
the Company in March 2013.
When granting LTI awards to Mr Soriot, the 
Remuneration Committee applied a target 
expected value of 250% of base salary, weighted 
25% in favour of the AZIP and 75% in favour of 
the PSP. For the AZIP, we assume an expected 
value on vesting of 100% of the value of the 
award at grant, which equates to an on-target 
award at face value of 62.5% of base salary.
Annual target award expressed as a percentage 
of base salary in respect of Mr Dunoyer's position 
as EVP, GPPS and an additional award to 
compensate Mr Dunoyer for the forfeiture of 
unvested LTI awards from his previous employer.

the PSP. For the AZIP, we assume an expected 
value on vesting of 100% of the value of the

award at face value of 52.5% of base salary at 
the time of the award.

Mr Lowth ceased to be a Director of the Company on 31 October 2013. Mr Lowth received his base salary and benefits up until the  
end of October 2013 and did not receive any payments for the remainder of his notice period. Mr Lowth was not eligible to receive an 
annual bonus for 2013 and all outstanding LTI awards made under the PSP and AZIP lapsed in accordance with the plan rules on 
resignation. The Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion by determining that Mr Lowth's Deferred Bonus Plan awards for 2010 
(10,281 shares), 2011 (9,001 shares) and 2012 (11,728 shares) would vest on their pre-determined vesting dates. The 2010 award will vest

The employee comparator group comprises employees in the UK, US and Sweden. We consider this to be an appropriate comparator 
group because it is representative of the Group's major functions (Commercial, R&D, Manufacturing and Supply, and Enabling Functions) 
and the employee populations are well balanced in terms of seniority and demographics. To provide a meaningful comparison of salary 
increases, a consistent employee comparator group is used by which the same individuals appear in the 2012 and 2013 group.

Directors' interests in shares (Audited)
Under the Company's Articles all Directors must, within two months of their appointment, acquire a beneficial interest in at least  
500 shares in the Company. All of the Directors fulfil this requirement at the date of this Directors' Remuneration Report.
In addition to this mandatory requirement, the Board imposes minimum shareholding requirements on the Executive Directors and SET 
members. The CEO is required to build a shareholding and hold shares amounting to 300% of base salary, and the CFO is required to 
hold shares amounting to 200% of base salary, each within five years of their date of appointment. At the date of this report, Mr Soriot has 
fulfilled this requirement but, in view of Mr Dunoyer's recent appointment as CFO, he does not yet fulfil the shareholding requirement.  
All other SET members are required to build a shareholding over time and hold 125% of base salary as shares while in office.
The Board also encourages each Non-Executive Director to build up, over a period of three years, a shareholding in the Company  
with a value approximately equivalent to the basic annual fee for a Non-Executive Director ( 75,000) or, in the case of the Chairman, 
approximately equivalent to his basic annual fee ( 500,000). Genevi ve Berger, Graham Chipchase and Bruce Burlington are building  
their shareholding in the Company over time. All of the other Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, had fulfilled this expectation 
as at 31 December 2013. Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report

(if earlier), as well as details of any Director's interests in options over the Company's shares. All such interests were beneficial except as 
otherwise stated. No Director or senior executive beneficially owns, or has options over, 1% or more of the issued share capital of the 
Company, nor do they have different voting rights from other shareholders. None of the Directors has a beneficial interest in the shares

Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2014
The Company's Remuneration Policy (the Policy) will be subject to a binding shareholder vote at the Company's AGM which will be held  
in April 2014. It is intended that the Policy will remain in force for three years unless earlier revision is required, and will be effective from  
1 January 2015. The Company will have regard to the proposed Policy in determining remuneration practices in the intervening period. 
The Implementation Report, detailing the implementation of the Company's remuneration policy in the previous year, will be subject to  
an advisory shareholder vote at the Company's AGM each year. 
Effective from 1 January 2014, Mr Soriot's base salary was increased in line with increases in the UK employee population by 3% to 
 1,133,000. Mr Soriot's pension allowance will increase to 30% of base salary per annum with effect from 1 January 2014, in line with 
pension allowances provided in comparable roles in the FTSE30. Mr Soriot's target annual bonus opportunity will remain unchanged  
at 100% of salary and his LTI plan target will remain unchanged at 250% of base salary. However, the Remuneration Committee has 
exercised its discretion to grant an above-target LTI award for 2014 of 285% of base salary. 
In view of the timing of Mr Dunoyer's appointment as CFO on 1 November 2013, the Remuneration Committee expects his remuneration 
will next be reviewed, in line with the Policy, at the end of 2014. Accordingly, for 2014, Mr Dunoyer's annualised base salary will remain 
unchanged at  680,000, his target annual bonus opportunity will remain unchanged at 90% of base salary and his LTI plan target award 
will remain unchanged at 200% of base salary. The Remuneration Committee awarded Mr Dunoyer an LTI award for 2014 of 200% of 
base salary.
The performance measures and weightings for 2014 in respect of the LTI plans (AZIP and PSP) will be consistent with those described in 
the Long Term Incentives section in the Remuneration Policy Report from page 117 . The annual bonus measures and weightings for 2014 
will be consistent with those set in 2013 as described in the summary table overleaf. Individual performance for each of the Directors will 
be assessed by reference to individual objectives in line with the Company's objectives for the year.
Further information on the performance measures and targets set in respect of the annual bonus for 2013 can be found in the Additional 
notes to the Directors' single total figure remuneration table section from page 105, and further information on the performance measures  
in respect of the Company's LTI plans in 2013 can be found in the Share interests awarded during the year tables from page 107 .
Board and Committee fees for the Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, will be reviewed in 2014. Further information on the 
Non-Executive Directors' Board and Committee fees can be found on page 126 of the Remuneration Policy Report. 112 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013

Corporate Governance | Directors' Remuneration Report
Remuneration Policy Report
This section sets out the Remuneration Policy (the Policy) that will be put forward for approval by shareholders at the Company's 
AGM in April 2014. It is intended that the Policy shall apply from 1 January 2015 for a period of three years, and that remuneration 
paid in the period between the date of the AGM and the effective date of the Policy will be substantially in line with the Policy. 
Setting the Company's Policy
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting overall remuneration policy and makes decisions about specific remuneration 
arrangements in the broader context of employee remuneration throughout the Group. All roles within the organisation are 
benchmarked against comparable roles in similar organisations and in the employee's local market to ensure the Company is paying 
fairly at all levels. Executive Directors' remuneration arrangements are benchmarked against a global pharmaceutical peer group and 
the FTSE30. Each year the Company actively engages with its employees, either on a Group-wide basis or in the context of smaller 
focus groups, in order to solicit feedback generally and on a wide range of specified issues, including pay. 
While the Remuneration Committee did not consult with employees when determining the Executive Directors' remuneration policy,  
it does annually review Group remuneration data including ratios of average pay to senior executive pay; bonus data; gender and 
geographical data in relation to base salaries and variable compensation; and aggregate data about the shareholding levels of senior 
managers. Many employees are also shareholders in the Company and therefore will have the opportunity to vote at the 2014 AGM 
on this Remuneration Policy Report. In reviewing the base salaries of Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee considers 
the overall level of any salary increases being awarded to employees in the Executive Director's local market in the relevant year. 
In all aspects of its work, the Remuneration Committee considers both the external environment in which the Company operates and 
the guidance issued by organisations representing institutional shareholders. It consults the Company's largest investors on general 
and specific remuneration matters and provides an annual opportunity for representatives of those investors to meet the Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee and other Remuneration Committee and Board members. Major shareholders were consulted on the 
changes made to the LTI performance measures in 2013, and it is the Company's policy to seek input from major shareholders on an 
ad hoc basis where significant changes to remuneration arrangements are proposed. Members of the Remuneration Committee met 
with major shareholders in December 2013 to discuss the more significant components of the Policy, as set out in this Remuneration 
Policy Report. The Company's shareholders are encouraged to attend the Company's AGM and any views expressed will be 
considered by the Remuneration Committee's members. The Remuneration Committee works with the Audit Committee to ensure 
that the Group's remuneration policies and practices achieve the right balance between appropriate incentives to reward good 
performance, managing risk, and the pursuit of the Company's business objectives. 
Legacy arrangements
The Remuneration Committee may approve remuneration payments and payments for loss of office where the terms of the  
payment were agreed before the Policy came into effect, or at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company 
(provided that, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the agreement was not in consideration for the individual becoming  
a Director of the Company). This includes the exercise of any discretion available to the Remuneration Committee in connection with 
such payments.
For these purposes, payments include the Remuneration Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration including awards 
over shares, on the basis of the terms agreed at the time the award is granted.
Minor amendments
The Remuneration Committee may make minor amendments to the arrangements for the Directors as described in this 
Remuneration Policy Report (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes, or to take account of a change  
in legislation). Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report

Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors 
Fixed elements of remuneration: base salary, benefits and pension
The Company's approach to determining and reviewing the salaries of the Executive Directors and the employee population as a 
whole is the same. On an annual basis, the salaries for individual roles are reviewed in the context of individual sustained performance 
and the external market. AstraZeneca participates in annual global compensation surveys, which provide benchmarking data for all 
roles within the organisation, ensuring a robust salary review process for all employees.
The Company seeks to provide an appropriate range of competitive benefits, including pension, to all employees (including Directors) 
in the context of their local market.
Base salary
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Base salary is intended to 
be sufficient (but no more 
than necessary) to attract, 
retain and develop 
high-calibre individuals  
in order to deliver the 
Company's strategy.
The Remuneration Committee determines base salary based on  
a number of factors, including (but not limited to):
 > Recognition of the value of an individual's sustained personal 
performance and contribution to the business
 > The individual's skills and experience 
 > Internal relativities
 > Conditions in the relevant external market.
Base salaries are normally reviewed annually to ensure they remain 
competitive, with any change usually taking effect from 1 January. 
There are no contractual provisions for clawback or malus of  
base salary.
The current base salaries can be found on page 105 of the 
Implementation Report. 
While there is no formal maximum, annual base salary increases,  
if any, for the Executive Directors will normally be in line with the 
percentage increases awarded to the employee population within  
the individual's country location. 
Higher increases may be made if the Remuneration Committee in its 
discretion considers it appropriate. For example, this may include:
 > Increase in the scope and/or responsibility of the individual's role
 > Development of the individual within the role.
Benefits
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
To provide market 
competitive benefits.
Non-cash benefits are 
designed to be sufficient 
(but no more generous 
than necessary) to attract, 
retain and develop 
high-calibre individuals 
in order to deliver the 
Company's strategy.
UK-based Executive Directors are provided with a fund under the UK 
Flexible Benefits Programme. The fund value is based on a range of 
benefits including:
 > Private Medical Insurance for partner and children
 > Life assurance
 > Permanent health insurance
 > Company car
 > Additional holidays
 > Other additional benefits made available by the Company from time 
to time that the Remuneration Committee considers appropriate 
based on the Executive Director's circumstances.
A Director may choose to take a proportion of, or the entire fund,  
as cash.
Non-UK based Executive Directors will receive a range of benefits  
(or a fund of equivalent value) comparable to those typically offered  
in their local market. They can elect to take the fund as cash or  
elect one or more of these benefits and take the balance as cash.
At its discretion, for Executive Directors on an international 
assignment or relocating to take up other Company duties, the 
Remuneration Committee may consider support towards the 
reasonable costs of relocation. 
At its discretion, the Remuneration Committee may provide an 
allowance towards the reasonable fees for professional services such 
as legal, tax, property and financial advice. The Company may also 
fund the cost of a driver and car for Executive Directors.
The Company also provides Directors' and Officers' Liability 
Insurance and an indemnity to the fullest extent permitted by the law 
and the Company's Articles. 
There are no contractual provisions for clawback or malus of benefits.
The current value of benefits available can be found on page 10  
of the Implementation Report. 
The maximum value of the fund available under the UK Flexible 
Benefits Programme will be equivalent to the cost to the Company  
of the suite of benefits at the time. 
The maximum value of the suite of benefits for non-UK based 
Executive Directors will be equivalent to the cost of the suite of 
benefits at the time. 
The value of the support towards the costs of relocation will be the 
reasonable costs associated with the Executive Director's particular 
circumstances.
The value of the support towards the costs of professional fees and 
other costs will be the reasonable costs associated with the Executive 
Director's particular circumstances.
The maximum value of the Directors' and Officers' Liability Insurance 
and third party indemnity insurance is the cost at the relevant time. 
While the Remuneration Committee has not set an overall level of 
benefit provision, the Remuneration Committee keeps the benefit 
policy and benefit levels under review. 
Pension
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Provision of retirement 
benefits to attract, retain 
and develop high-calibre 
individuals in order to 
deliver the Company's 
strategy.
Company allocations for Executive Directors' pensions will be a 
proportion of the individual's base salary and is in line with local 
market practice.
As part of the UK Flexible Benefits Programme, the Company 
provides an allocation consisting of a percentage of the UK-based 
Executive Director's base salary, which the Executive Director can 
elect to pay into a pension scheme or take as cash. The Company  
will allocate an amount benchmarked to the local market. 
There are no contractual provisions for clawback or malus of pension.
Currently the CEO and CFO receive an allocation equivalent to 30% 
and 24% of their base salaries respectively as a contribution towards 
the cost of their pension provisions. 
The maximum annual allocation that may be provided to UK-based 
Executive Directors is 35% of base salary.
Non-UK-based Executive Directors will receive a fund for the purpose 
of providing retirement benefits in line with the local market practice. 
The maximum value of that fund will be a sum equivalent to local 
market practice. The Executive Director may elect to take some or all 
of the fund as cash. 116 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Corporate Governance | Directors' Remuneration Report
Variable elements of remuneration 
Annual bonus
All employee bonuses are determined by reference to the Group scorecard and an assessment of individual performance. The Group 
scorecard is designed to reflect the Company's strategy and the focus of its business activity and priorities in the performance year. 
The performance measures are recommended by the CEO and determined by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of 
each year. They are designed to ensure that all eligible employees receive an element of reward based on the Group's overall financial 
and non-financial performance. A scorecard approach ensures that all employees across functions and geographies are focused on 
the activities critical to delivering the business strategy. The performance measures and weightings underlying the annual bonus plan 
will be disclosed in advance. The outcomes against targets, for reasons of commercial sensitivity, will be disclosed in arrears. The 
Implementation Report will identify, in arrears, the performance versus the objectives and the consequent levels of remuneration 
deemed appropriate by the Remuneration Committee. 
For Executive Directors one-third of their pre-tax annual bonus is delivered in shares, which are deferred for three years, under the 
Deferred Bonus Plan. Employees below SET level receive a bonus in cash and are not required to defer a proportion in shares. 
Annual bonus: cash
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and framework used to assess performance Maximum opportunity
The annual cash bonus 
rewards short-term 
performance against 
specific annual Group  
and individual objectives.
These objectives are 
designed to facilitate the 
delivery of the Company's 
short-term strategy  
and thereby create value 
for our shareholders  
over time.
The annual cash bonus is based on Group and individual performance in the relevant performance year.
Scorecard measures and targets are set annually by the Remuneration Committee based on the key strategic 
objectives for the year. Payout levels are determined by the Remuneration Committee after the year end,  
based on performance against targets. The performance period is one year.
The performance measures form a Group scorecard which is closely aligned to business strategy, and  
rewards scientific, commercial and financial success. While we expect the performance measures to be  
largely unchanged each year, the Remuneration Committee believes it is inadvisable to commit to a fixed  
set of measures in advance in order to retain flexibility to align incentives with the focus of corporate strategy  
in the relevant year. 
The greatest weighting is typically placed on the achievement of financial targets, with an equal weighting 
between the scientific and commercial growth metrics reflecting the importance of both sales and R&D 
success. The actual annual weighting will depend on the strategic priorities for the performance year. 
The Group scorecard is made up of a number of separate metrics within each performance measure. Each 
metric has a payout range associated with it (including a target which is intended to be stretching). In relation  
to each metric, a threshold level of performance is specified. If performance falls below this level there will  
be no payout for that proportion of the award. Each metric has a different weighting. If none of the metrics 
attributable to a performance measure is met then a bonus payout will not be made in respect of that 
performance measure. If none of the metrics is met in any of the performance measures, then no bonus  
payout will be made.
The Board will consider Company performance against the Group scorecard objectives as well as the 
Executive Director's individual performance in order to determine the value of the bonus award. Individual 
performance will be assessed by the Remuneration Committee on the basis of objective criteria established  
by the Chairman in the case of the CEO, and by the CEO in the case of the CFO. The Remuneration Committee 
has the discretion to move the theoretical award up or down subject to the annual bonus award being no 
greater than the maximum percentage of base salary applicable to that award in the year in question.
The Remuneration Committee will use its discretion to ensure that a fair and balanced outcome is achieved, 
taking into account the overall performance of the Company and the experience of its shareholders.
Two-thirds of the annual bonus is delivered in cash and one-third is delivered in shares, which are deferred  
for three years as explained below. 
The annual bonus, including the deferred share element, payable for target performance for the CEO is 
currently 100% of base salary and for the CFO is currently 90% of base salary. 
For bonuses awarded in respect of 2015 and subsequent years, the Remuneration Committee will have 
discretion, for up to six years from the payment date, to claw back from individuals some or all of the  
cash bonus award in certain circumstances including (i) material restatement of the results of the Group,  
(ii) significant reputational damage to the Group, or (iii) serious misconduct by the individual. However,  
in the case of (i) and (ii) the Remuneration Committee may only exercise its discretion for up to two years  
from the payment date. 
The maximum annual 
amount payable to an 
Executive Director, is 
250% of base salary. 
If the Remuneration 
Committee ever  
felt that it would be  
in the interests of 
shareholders to grant 
an annual bonus of an 
amount exceeding the 
historical maximum 
opportunity of 180%  
of base salary in the 
case of the CEO and 
150% of base salary  
in the case of the  
CFO, it would consult  
major shareholders  
in advance.
Annual bonus: Deferred Bonus Plan
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and framework used to assess performance Maximum opportunity
The deferred share 
element of the annual cash 
bonus under the Deferred 
Bonus Plan is designed to 
align Executive Directors' 
interests with those of 
shareholders. 
Executive Directors are required to defer one-third of their pre-tax annual cash bonus into shares. 
On vesting, the cash value equivalent to dividends that would have been paid during the three-year holding  
period will be paid subject to continued employment.
Directors must normally remain in employment for three years from grant for deferred shares to vest.
Once performance measures have been applied to determine the value of the total bonus, no further 
performance measures apply to the deferred share element.
For deferred share elements relating to bonuses awarded in respect of 2015 and subsequent years, the 
Remuneration Committee has discretion: 
 > to reduce or cancel any portion of an unvested deferred bonus award in certain circumstances (malus), 
including (i) material restatement of the results of the Group, (ii) significant reputational damage to the Group,  
or (iii) serious misconduct by the individual; 
 > for up to six years from the vesting date, to claw back from individuals some or all of the deferred bonus  
award in certain circumstances, including (i) material restatement of the results of the Group, (ii) significant 
reputational damage to the Group, or (iii) serious misconduct by the individual. However, in the case of (i) and  
(ii) the Remuneration Committee may only exercise its discretion for up to two years from the vesting date. 
The maximum deferred 
bonus for Executive 
Directors is one-third  
of the maximum pre-tax 
bonus as detailed in the 
Annual bonus: cash 
section above. Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
117 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Long Term Incentives (LTIs)
Overview: An Executive Director's target LTI award is considered annually and set at a level which takes account of market analysis. 
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to grant awards above or below target based on individual performance and potential. 
The CEO's current LTI target is 250% of base salary on an expected value basis, and the CFO's current LTI target is 200% of base 
salary on an expected value basis. An illustration of the expected value basis can be found in the Remuneration scenarios for 
Executive Directors section from page 121.
The Company's variable long-term arrangements for Executive Directors currently comprise two LTI plans: the PSP and the AZIP . 
Under each of these plans the maximum market value of shares that may be awarded is 500% of a participant's base salary. If the 
Remuneration Committee ever felt that it would be in the interests of shareholders to grant annual variable awards to an Executive 
Director with values exceeding the historical range of up to 500% in aggregate under the LTI plans, it would consult major 
shareholders in advance. Currently when LTI awards are granted to Executive Directors, the split between the two plans is weighted 
in the proportion: 75% PSP and 25% AZIP .
When granting LTI awards the Remuneration Committee applies a target as a percentage of base salary on an expected value basis. 
For the AZIP , the expected value on vesting is 100% of the value of the award at grant. For the PSP , the expected value on vesting is 
50% of the value of the award at grant. 
The table overleaf explains the operation, minimums and maximums payable under each of these LTI plans.
Performance measures: Performance measures are recommended by the CEO and determined by the Remuneration Committee. 
The performance measures in respect of the PSP are designed to drive long-term performance against the Company's strategic 
objectives, in terms of commercial, scientific and financial success. 
In respect of the AZIP , dividend-based performance hurdles motivate the generation of returns for shareholders on a sustainable 
basis over an extended period of time, and will be set by the Remuneration Committee at a level it considers appropriate at the  
start of the performance period. The combined eight-year performance and holding period is designed to reflect the development 
cycle of a medicine and therefore to align executive reward with successful product development.
When setting the performance measures at the start of the performance period, the Remuneration Committee will also determine an 
appropriate payout curve (if any), for each measure. The Remuneration Committee will assess performance against the performance 
measures to determine the level of payout. The Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to increase or decrease the 
payout should it consider it appropriate, subject to the maximum percentage of base salary applicable in the year in question. The 
intention of the Remuneration Committee is to exercise judgement appropriately, in particular so that the experience of shareholders 
over time is taken into account. As a matter of good practice, certain major shareholders would be consulted before any material 
change to the performance measures for the PSP or AZIP are implemented.
The Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that, on the one hand, reward outcomes are not purely mechanistic; but on the other, 
that in exercising its discretion, that exercise is not seen by employees to be arbitrary or unfair. The Remuneration Committee's 
objective is to use reward arrangements to drive performance by employees which supports the creation of value for shareholders.
Cessation of employment and other circumstances: The LTI plans are governed by plan rules, which define how individual 
awards should be treated upon termination of an Executive Director's employment (see Principles of payment for loss of office for 
Executive Directors section on page 124). Provision is also made for the treatment of awards in respect of corporate activity including 
rights issues, sale of a business outside the Group and a change of control. The treatment of awards in these circumstances is also 
subject to Remuneration Committee discretion. In the event of a change of control an award will vest pro rata to the time elapsed 
between the date of grant of the award and the date of the event to the extent that the performance measures have been met up to 
the date of the event, subject to the Remuneration Committee's discretion to make an alternative determination. 
Other employees: Other employees at mid to senior levels globally are eligible for LTI awards in the form of PSP and/or Restricted 
Stock Units. The occupants of approximately 700 senior roles in the Company are currently eligible for PSP awards - these are the 
leaders who have the ability directly to influence the delivery of the Company's strategic goals. Awards under the AZIP are currently 
granted to SET members only (including the Executive Directors). 118 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Corporate Governance | Directors' Remuneration Report
AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and framework used to assess performance Maximum opportunity
The PSP is an LTI plan 
designed to align the 
variable pay of our 
Executive Directors directly 
to the delivery of our 
medium-term business 
strategy. 
The PSP provides for the grant of awards over Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
Vesting is dependent on the achievement of stretching three-year performance targets and 
continued employment. 
Performance measures and targets under the PSP are determined by the Remuneration 
Committee at the start of the relevant three-year performance period and consist of a range of 
measures designed to incentivise performance in furtherance of the Company's business strategy. 
The performance measures (currently a combination of four measures: TSR, cumulative cash flow, 
sales of medicines in key therapy areas and territories, and innovation metrics) are closely aligned 
to business strategy, and reward commercial, scientific and financial success.
Currently each of the four measures has an equal weighting. When setting the performance 
measures at the start of the performance period, the Remuneration Committee will allocate 
weightings to those measures as it considers appropriate, taking into account strategic and 
business priorities.
The three-year performance period commences on 1 January in the year of the award. The vesting 
date is the third anniversary of the date on which the award is granted. A two-year holding period 
commencing three years from the date of grant for Executive Directors will be included in the new 
PSP rules which are being put to shareholders for approval at the AGM in 2014 and, if approved, 
will be effective for awards made after the AGM. These awards will vest at the end of the holding 
period. During the holding period, no further performance measures will apply as performance has 
already been assessed.
All the performance measures have a payout curve. The payout curves are structured in different 
ways depending on the overall objective they are intended to measure. Typically, performance 
measures are structured such that 25% of the award will vest for threshold level of performance. 
The relationship between threshold, target and out-performance will be determined by the 
Remuneration Committee at each grant of the PSP and is dependent on whether the performance 
measure is science, commercial or finance based. An award will typically vest at 100% if the target 
(usually set at upper quartile performance) is achieved and threshold level of performance 
associated with any metric will be at or above a median level. There will be other vesting points 
between the threshold and maximum of 100% vesting, typically on a straight-line basis where the 
performance measures permit. 
The Remuneration Committee may (acting fairly and reasonably) adjust or waive a performance target 
if an event occurs that causes it to believe that the performance target is no longer appropriate.
Payouts can range from 0% to 100% of the original award.
On vesting, the cash value equivalent to dividends accrued during the vesting period will be paid.
Subject to shareholder approval of the renewal of the PSP at the 2014 AGM, for awards granted 
under the PSP after the AGM and in subsequent years, the Remuneration Committee will have 
discretion: 
 > to reduce or cancel any portion of an unvested award in certain circumstances (malus), including 
(i) material restatement of the results of the Group, (ii) significant reputational damage to the 
Group, or (iii) serious misconduct by the individual; 
 > for up to six years from the third anniversary of the date of grant, to claw back from individuals 
some or all of the award in certain circumstances, including (i) material restatement of the results 
of the Group, (ii) significant reputational damage to the Group, or (iii) serious misconduct by the 
individual. However, in the case of (i) and (ii) the Remuneration Committee may only exercise its 
discretion for up to two years from the third anniversary of the date of grant. 
Under the PSP plan rules, the 
maximum market value of shares  
that may be awarded at the date of 
grant in respect of any year is 500% 
of a participant's annual base salary. 
If each aspect of all of the 
performance measures is met  
and exceeded, the Remuneration 
Committee currently has the 
discretion to pay out a maximum  
of 125% of the value of the original 
award. However, the Remuneration 
Committee has determined that it will 
not exercise this discretion in relation 
to outstanding or future awards. 
This feature has therefore been 
removed from the new PSP rules 
which are being put to shareholders 
for approval at the AGM in 2014. Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report

AstraZeneca Investment Plan (AZIP)
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and framework used to assess performance Maximum opportunity
The combined eight-year 
performance and holding 
periods of the AZIP are 
influenced by the Group's 
medicine development 
cycle, reflecting the long- 
term investment horizons 
that are a feature of the 
pharmaceutical industry. 
The AZIP provides for the grant of awards over Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
Vesting is dependent on achievement of two performance measures over a four-year performance 
period. The award is then subject to a further four-year holding period. Payout of the award is 
subject to continued employment. 
Performance measures and targets under the AZIP are determined by the Remuneration 
Committee at the start of the relevant four-year performance period.
Currently, two performance measures apply: dividend level and dividend cover. Both measures 
must be achieved for the award to vest. 
If an event occurs which causes the Remuneration Committee (acting fairly and reasonably)  
to consider that a performance measure is no longer appropriate it may adjust that measure.
The AZIP is operated over a four-year performance period, with a subsequent four-year holding 
period. Performance periods commence on 1 January in the year of the award. Holding periods 
run for a period of four years starting from the end of the performance period, and end on the 
eighth anniversary of the start of the performance period. During the holding period, no further 
performance measures apply as performance has already been assessed. 
If both measures are achieved in each year of the performance period, the award will vest in full  
at the end of the holding period. If either or both of the measures are not achieved, the award  
will lapse.
On vesting, the cash value equivalent to dividends paid during the performance and holding 
periods will be paid.
For awards granted under the AZIP prior to the AGM in 2014, the Company may reduce or cancel 
some or all of the shares that are the subject of a participant's award at any time during the 
performance or the holding period if, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee (acting fairly 
and reasonably), this is warranted by the underlying performance of the Company, the occurrence 
of an event that causes, or is very likely to cause, reputational damage to the Company, or serious 
misconduct by the participant.
In order to ensure consistency between our LTI plans, for awards granted under the AZIP on or 
after the AGM and in subsequent years, the Remuneration Committee will have discretion: 
 > to reduce or cancel any portion of an unvested award in certain circumstances (malus), including 
(i) material restatement of the results of the Group, (ii) significant reputational damage to the 
Group, or (iii) serious misconduct by the individual;
 > for up to six years from the end of the performance period, to claw back from individuals some  
or all of the award in certain circumstances, including (i) in the case of material restatement of the 
results of the Group, (ii) significant reputational damage to the Group, or (iii) serious misconduct 
by the individual. However, in the case of (i) and (ii) the Remuneration Committee may only 
exercise its discretion for up to two years from the end of the performance period. 
Under the AZIP plan rules the 
maximum market value of shares that 
may be awarded at the date of grant 
in respect of any year is 500% of a 
participant's annual base salary. 120 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Corporate Governance | Directors' Remuneration Report
Restricted shares
In certain circumstances, as part of the recruitment arrangements, an Executive Director may be awarded restricted shares.  
There are no performance measures attached to awards of restricted shares because typically they will be awarded for the purpose 
of compensating newly recruited Executive Directors for loss of entitlements on leaving a previous employment. However, the 
Remuneration Committee will consider whether the lost incentives were subject to performance measures and their likely vesting.  
If foregone awards were subject to performance testing, then the compensatory AstraZeneca award will normally be granted under 
the PSP and/or AZIP in order to align the performance conditions attaching to the award to the delivery of the Company's strategy. 
Restricted share awards will generally be used only when the foregone compensation was not subject to performance testing.
The Remuneration Committee may divide an award of restricted shares into tranches vesting at different points and may apply 
performance measures bespoke to the individual if it considers it appropriate. If it decides to attach performance conditions, the 
performance conditions and period will be defined at grant.
In most instances, there are no performance conditions attached to these awards. They will therefore vest in full if the individual 
remains in office on the vesting date. 
On vesting, the cash value equivalent to dividends accrued during the vesting period will be paid.
There are no contractual provisions for clawback or malus of awards of restricted shares.
Restricted shares may be used for the same purpose on the recruitment of other employees. 
AstraZeneca also operates another restricted share plan (the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan) to provide LTI awards  
to eligible employees globally. Currently Executive Directors and other senior executives are not eligible to participate in this plan.
Award of restricted shares
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and framework used to assess performance Maximum opportunity
In certain circumstances,  
as part of recruitment 
arrangements, an Executive 
Director may be made 
awards of restricted shares. 
This would ordinarily be to 
compensate for loss of 
remuneration opportunities 
suffered on leaving previous 
employment. 
See above. There is no maximum value of an 
award which may be granted. 
The Remuneration Committee will 
determine the value of the award at 
grant, as it considers appropriate in 
all the circumstances.
Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and framework used to assess performance Maximum opportunity
The RSP is a LTI plan 
designed to align the 
variable pay of our key 
employees, excluding 
Executive Directors, 
directly to the delivery of 
our business strategy.
The RSP provides for the granting of restricted share awards to key employees, excluding 
Executive Directors.
Mr Dunoyer, who was appointed as an Executive Director subsequent to his appointment as EVP, 
GPPS, was granted an award of restricted shares to compensate for loss of entitlements as a 
result of leaving his previous employment. 
Under the RSP plan rules the 
maximum market value of shares that 
may be awarded at the date of grant 
in respect of any year is 500% of a 
participant's annual base salary.
The Remuneration Committee will 
determine the value of the award at 
grant, as it considers appropriate in 
all the circumstances.
In the case of Mr Dunoyer, the 
maximum payable is 100% of the 
shares awarded (65,505 shares).

Remuneration scenarios for Executive Directors 
The charts below illustrate how much the current Executive Directors could receive under different performance scenarios in the first year 
of the Policy, assuming a constant share price. 
In order to compile the charts below, the following assumptions have been made:
Minimum 
remuneration
Consists of the fixed elements of remuneration only: base salary, taxable benefits and pension.
 > Base salary is latest known salary, ie that applicable in 2014 as the Remuneration Committee will not determine 
base salaries for 2015 until the end of 2014. 
 > Taxable benefits is taken from the corresponding figure in the Directors' single total figure remuneration table  
as set out on page 105, with such sum annualised in the case of Mr Dunoyer. 
 > Pension measured as a cash payment equivalent to 30% of base salary in the case of the CEO and 24% of 
base salary in the case of the CFO.

Remuneration  
for on-plan 
performance 
(target)
Based on what the Executive Director would receive if performance were in line with the Company's expectations:
 > on-target annual bonus payout of 100% of base salary for the CEO, and 90% for the CFO
 > LTI shares which vest at an expected value of 250% of base salary for the CEO (200% in the case of the CFO). 
Remuneration for 
out-performance 
(above target/
maximum)
Based on what the Executive Director would receive at stretch performance and maximum vesting of the 
performance shares:
 > an annual bonus payout of 180% of base salary for the CEO, and 150% for the CFO
 > maximum vesting of the awards made under the Company's LTI plans (representing 100% of the face value of the 
PSP and AZIP awards where the PSP has an expected value of 50% and the AZIP an expected value of 100%).

Marc Dunoyer Pascal Soriot
The charts above also include the LTI awards that could be granted in 2015. When granting LTI awards the Remuneration Committee 
applies a target as a percentage of base salary on an expected value basis. For the AZIP , the expected value on vesting is 100% of the 
value of the award at grant, and for the PSP , the expected value on vesting is 50% of the award at grant.
When granting LTI awards for the CEO, we apply a target expected value of 250% of base salary weighted 25% in favour of the AZIP  
(ie 62.5% of base salary) which provides for an award at face value of 62.5% of base salary, and 75% in favour of the PSP (ie 187 .5%  
of base salary) which provides for an award at face value of 375% of base salary. 
Accordingly, the combination of the AZIP and PSP awards for the CEO at an expected value of 250% provides a maximum number  
of shares under the awards with a face value of 437 .5% of base salary.
When granting LTI awards for the CFO, we apply a target expected value of 200% of base salary, weighted 25% in favour of the AZIP  
(ie 50% of base salary) which provides for an award at face value of 50% of base salary, and 75% in favour of the PSP (ie 150% of base 
salary) which provides for an award at face value of 300% of base salary. 
Accordingly, the combination of the AZIP and PSP awards for the CFO at an expected value of 200% provides a maximum number  
of shares under the awards with a face value of 350% of base salary. 122 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Corporate Governance | Directors' Remuneration Report
Approach to recruitment remuneration for Executive Directors
The Company seeks to pay no more than necessary to recruit the best candidate available for a role as an Executive Director. On the 
recruitment of a new Executive Director, the Company seeks to put in place a remuneration package which is broadly in line with the 
remuneration package applicable to relevant incumbent Executive Directors. However, in order to offer a competitive package to the most 
capable candidate, the Company may consider providing remuneration arrangements that exceed those of existing Executive Directors. 
The Remuneration Committee may also agree to pay allowances to expatriates in line with the Company's international assignment policy 
which provides for support towards housing, schooling and other relocation or assignment related costs. 
The remuneration package offered to new recruits may include any element listed in the policy table above, or any other element which 
the Remuneration Committee considers is appropriate given the particular circumstances, with due respect to the interests of the 
Company's shareholders. 
In considering which elements to include, and in determining the approach for all relevant elements, the Remuneration Committee will 
take into account a number of different factors, including typical market practice, existing arrangements for the other Executive Directors 
and internal relativities and market positioning. 
The Company may reimburse the costs of financial planning and tax advice to Executive Directors. The Company also provides  
Directors' and Officers' Liability Insurance and an indemnity to the fullest extent permitted by the law and the Company's Articles to  
all Executive Directors.
The Company may find it necessary to compensate a new recruit for forfeiture of entitlements from a previous employer. The value of 
such compensation cannot be anticipated and will depend upon a range of factors including the circumstances of the individual in 
question. In such circumstances, the Company will seek to offer a package weighted towards equity in the Company. However, the 
precise nature of the compensation package will depend on the type of entitlement that the recruit is foregoing and which the Company 
will generally seek to compensate in kind; the buyout might therefore comprise cash and/or restricted shares and/or LTI. The Remuneration 
Committee will obtain and take into account independent valuations of the entitlements to determine the appropriate level of 
compensation.
Shares which could be offered to the new recruit would be granted under LTI plans available at the time or under a plan specific to that 
individual as permitted under the Financial Conduct Authority's Listing Rules. Performance measures may apply to such share awards. 
The Company's policy seeks to link the performance of the Executive Director to the performance of the Company in any given period. 
The precise targets and measures will depend on the objectives of the Company and the individual at that time and will be determined by 
the Remuneration Committee. 
The Company will not offer cash or shares to newly recruited Executive Directors as a bonus, or  golden hello' on joining other than to 
compensate for the loss of a previous remuneration opportunity. Where compensation is offered to a new recruit on his or her hire, the 
Company will explain the reasons for this to shareholders in a timely manner, and will provide details of the payments. 
Ongoing annual variable remuneration will not exceed an award which comprises up to 250% of base salary under the annual bonus and 
up to 500% of base salary under the PSP and up to 500% of base salary under the AZIP . If the Remuneration Committee ever felt that it 
would be in the interests of shareholders to grant annual variable awards to a new Executive Director with values exceeding the historical 
range of 0 - 680% of base salary (comprising up to 180% under the annual bonus and up to 500% in aggregate under the LTI plans),  
it would consult major shareholders in advance.
The Company intends to honour all remuneration arrangements previously entered into in the case of Group employees who are 
promoted to the position of an Executive Director.  Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
123 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Service contracts for Executive Directors
Save as noted below, it is not intended that service contracts for new Executive Directors will contain terms that are materially different 
from those summarised below or contained in the Policy set out in this Remuneration Policy Report. The contractual obligations below  
are applicable to each of the current Executive Directors unless stated otherwise, and to the Executive Directors only.
Notice period The Company may terminate the employment of an Executive Director by giving not less than 12 months' written 
notice. The Company may agree, on the appointment of a new Executive Director, that any notice given by the 
Company will not expire prior to the second anniversary of the commencement date of the Executive Director's 
appointment. The Company agreed to such a provision in the case of Mr Dunoyer. 
An Executive Director may terminate his employment on 12 months' written notice.
Payment in  
lieu of notice
The Company may terminate an Executive Director's contract at any time with immediate effect and pay him a sum 
in lieu of notice. This sum will consist of (i) the base salary that the relevant Executive Director would have been 
entitled to receive during the notice period; and (ii) the cost to the Company of funding the Executive Director's 
flexible benefit arrangements for this period, including the Company's contribution in respect of pension. 
The payment in lieu of notice may be paid as a lump sum or the Company may decide to pay the first six months of the 
payment in lieu in equal monthly instalments, with the balance paid within 30 days of the final instalment being paid. 
Garden leave If an Executive Director has given or been given notice of termination, the Company has the right to place the 
Executive Director on  garden leave'. 
Summary 
termination
The Company may terminate an Executive Director's employment summarily, in particular defined circumstances 
such as gross misconduct, with no further payment.
Payments in  
lieu of holiday
If, on termination, the relevant Executive Director has exceeded his accrued holiday entitlement, the value of this 
excess may be deducted by the Company from any sums payable. If the Executive Director has unused holiday, 
entitlement, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to require the Executive Director to take such unused 
holiday during any notice period, or make a payment in lieu of it calculated in the same way as the value of any 
excess holiday.
Directors' and 
Officers' Liability 
Insurance
Directors' and Officers' Liability Insurance and an indemnity to the fullest extent permitted by the law and the 
Company's Articles is provided to the Executive Directors for the duration of their employment and for a minimum  
of five years following termination.
Deemed  
treatment  
under AZIP  
and restricted 
share award
In respect of awards made to compensate Mr Soriot for loss of remuneration opportunity at his previous employer,  
if Mr Soriot gives notice of termination of his employment after the end of the performance period under the AZIP 
but before the end of the holding period, the award under the AZIP will vest on the earlier of the end of the holding 
period and the end of the period of 24 months from the date of cessation of employment, unless the Remuneration 
Committee determines otherwise. If Mr Soriot's employment is terminated by the Company (other than in the event 
of prescribed misconduct events), his restricted share award will continue to subsist. 124 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Corporate Governance | Directors' Remuneration Report
Principles of payment for loss of office for Executive Directors
The Company does not make additional payments for loss of office, other than, as appropriate, payments in lieu of notice as described 
above or payments in respect of damages if the Company terminates an Executive Director's service contract in breach of contract  
(taking into account, as appropriate, the Director's ability to mitigate his loss). The Remuneration Committee has discretion to award 
payments in certain circumstances, as set out below, depending on the nature of the termination and the Executive Director's 
performance. The LTI plans are governed by plan rules, which define how individual awards under those plans should be treated upon 
termination of employment. Provision is also made for the treatment of awards in respect of corporate activity including sale of a business 
outside the Group. The treatment of awards in these circumstances may also be subject to Remuneration Committee discretion. 
Generally, awards under LTI plans will only be allowed to vest for those Executive Directors who leave the Company by mutual agreement, 
for example in circumstances of ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy or retirement, or where employment terminates by reason  
of the Executive Director's death (see the table opposite for further information). In addition to any payment in lieu of notice, the individual 
components of remuneration and other payments which may be payable on loss of office are set out below, subject to the terms of any 
applicable bonus rules or share incentive plan rules:
>  Annual bonus 
An Executive Director may receive a bonus for the performance year in which he leaves the Company. Typically this sum will reflect  
an on-target bonus pro-rated for the part of the year in which he worked. This is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and 
will depend on the circumstances, including an assessment of the Executive Director's performance in the relevant period and the 
circumstances of his departure. The deferred share element of previous bonuses granted, and any deferred share element of the bonus 
awarded in respect of the departing year, may still vest for the benefit of the departing Executive Director at the end of the period of 
deferral despite the fact that the Executive Director did not work for the entirety of this period. The Remuneration Committee has  
the discretion to accelerate and/or retain the deferral period and allow shares to vest for the benefit of the Executive Director on his 
departure and/or in accordance with the vesting schedule as the case may be. The Remuneration Committee will decide whether  
it is appropriate in the circumstances for these shares to vest for the benefit of the departing Executive Director. 
>  LTI plans  
The rules of the LTI plans envisage circumstances under which some, all or none of an Executive Director's shares held under LTI plans 
will vest in connection with his departure. The exact timing and number of shares vesting will depend on the circumstances, including 
the Executive Director's reason for leaving (as set out in the table opposite) and may be subject to Remuneration Committee discretion, 
depending on what it considers to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances. 
>  Restricted share awards and awards under the RSP 
The treatment on termination will depend upon the terms of the individual Executive Director's awards on recruitment. The Remuneration 
Committee has discretion to determine the treatment at the time of departure based on what it considers to be fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances.
>  Non-statutory redundancy payment 
Executive Directors are not entitled to non-statutory redundancy payments.
>  Pension contributions and other benefits 
Pension contributions and other benefits for Executive Directors will be payable up to the termination date or as part of a payment in lieu 
of notice as described on page 123.
>  Payments in relation to statutory rights 
The amount considered reasonable to pay by the Remuneration Committee in respect of statutory rights may be included in the overall 
termination payment.
>  Payments required by law 
The Company may pay damages, awards, fines or other compensation awarded to or in respect of an Executive Director by any 
competent court or tribunal or other payments required to be made on termination of employment by any applicable law, regulator  
or collective labour agreement.
>  M i tig ati o n 
The departing Executive Director will be required to mitigate his loss by using reasonable efforts to secure new employment. 
>  Professional fees 
The Company may pay an amount considered reasonable by the Remuneration Committee in respect of fees for legal and tax advice, 
and outplacement support for the departing Executive Director. Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report

Where cessation of employment occurs within three years of the date of grant  
awards will vest, pro rata to the time elapsed between the date of grant of the award 
and the date of cessation of employment, at the end of the performance period after 
performance has been assessed, to the extent that the performance target(s) measured 
over the performance period has been met. 
Where cessation of employment occurs during any holding period the award will vest in 
respect of all the shares that continue to be subject to the award as soon as practicable 
following the cessation of employment.
However, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to permit the award to vest 
immediately on cessation of employment where that cessation occurred as a result of 
one of the events mentioned above to the extent that the performance target(s) has,  
in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, been satisfied from the date of grant  
to the date of cessation of employment. 
However, if the Remuneration Committee believes that exceptional circumstances 
warrant this, it may exercise its discretion to vest the award on another basis.
Ordinarily awards will lapse unless the 
Remuneration Committee exercises its 
discretion to preserve all or part of an award 
and apply the default treatment for leavers by 
mutual agreement as described in this table.
This discretion will not be exercised in the case 
of dismissal for gross misconduct. 
AZIP
Death, ill-health, injury or disability:
 > in the performance period: the award will vest as soon as practicable following the 
cessation of employment, pro-rated to take into account the period elapsed between

period and pro-rated to take into account the satisfaction of any performance 
measure(s), as agreed by the Remuneration Committee; 
 > in the holding period: the award will vest in respect of all the shares that continue  
to be subject to the award as soon as practicable following the cessation of 
employment.
Redundancy, retirement or certain corporate events (eg sale of a business outside  
the Group):
 > in the performance period: the award will vest at the later of the end of the 
performance period and the end of the period of 24 months from the date of 
cessation of employment, to the extent any performance measures have been met  
by the end of the performance period and pro-rated to take into account the period 
elapsed between the date of grant and the date of cessation of employment relative 
to the performance period; 
 > in the holding period: the award will vest in respect of all shares that continue to  
be subject to the award at the earlier of the end of the holding period and the end  
of the period of 24 months from the date of cessation of employment. Where the 
Remuneration Committee terminates an Executive Director's employment (other  
than for gross misconduct) during the holding period, the awards will vest on the 
same basis.
In each case described above, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to vest  
the award or part of the award on a different basis.
Ordinarily awards will lapse unless the 
Remuneration Committee exercises its 
discretion to apply the default treatment for 
leavers by reason of redundancy or retirement 
described in this table.

In relation to awards granted on or after 3 February 2014 and, where that award  
was granted at the time of the Executive Director's recruitment to the Company in 
compensation for any awards or bonuses forfeited at his previous employer, the award 
will vest on the date his employment ceases, pro-rated to take into account the period 
elapsed between the date of grant and the date of cessation of employment, unless the 
Remuneration Committee decides not to pro-rate or to pro-rate on some other basis.

Future Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors 
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, receive annual Board fees. Additional fees are also payable for membership and 
chairmanship of a Board Committee. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for performance-related bonuses or the grant of share 
awards or options. No pension contributions are made on their behalf. The annual Board fees applicable to Non-Executive Directors 
during 2013 are set out below. Fees applicable in future years will be set out in the corresponding year's Implementation Report. 
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. The remuneration of the 
Chairman is determined by the other members of the Remuneration Committee and the Senior independent Non-Executive Director.

Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
The annual fees are 
intended to be sufficient 
(but no more than 
necessary) to attract, 
retain and develop 
high-calibre individuals.
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, receive annual Board fees and additional fees 
for membership and chairmanship of a Board Committee. 
The individual fees paid to a Non-Executive Director are subject to periodic review and may be 
increased in the future to ensure that they remain sufficient to attract high-calibre individuals while 
remaining fair and proportionate. While Non-Executive Directors currently receive their fees in 
cash, the Company reserves the right to award part, or all, of their fees in shares.
There are no contractual provisions for clawback or malus of fees.

Chairman's fee 500,000

Intended to attract and

individuals.
The Company also provides Directors' and Officers' Liability Insurance and an indemnity to the 
fullest extent permitted by the law and the Company's Articles and may also reimburse the costs 
of financial planning and tax advice.
The maximum amount payable in 
respect of these costs and cost of 
insurance will be the reimbursement 
of the Directors' benefits grossed up 
for any tax payable by the individual. 
Other costs and expenses
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Intended to reimburse 
individuals for legitimately 
incurred costs and 
expenses.
In addition to the Chairman's fee, a proportion of the office costs of the Chairman are reimbursed. 
In 2013, this amounted to  40,000. The amount of office costs to be reimbursed each year will be 
determined at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, based on an assessment of the 
reasonable requirements of the Chairman. The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to 
approve contributions by the Company to office costs of other Non-Executive Directors in 
circumstances where such payments are deemed proportionate and reasonable.
The Company will pay for all travel (including travel to the Company's offices), hotel and other 
expenses reasonably incurred by Non-Executive Directors in the course of the Company's 
business, for example, professional fees such as secretarial support, and reimbursement for 
domestic security arrangements such as lights and alarms following a security assessment.
There are no contractual provisions for clawback or malus of other costs and expenses.
The maximum amounts payable in 
respect of these costs and expenses 
will be the reimbursement of the 
Directors' costs and expenses 
grossed up for any tax payable by  
the individual.
Letters of appointment
None of the Non-Executive Directors has a service contract but all have letters of appointment. In accordance with the Articles, following 
their appointment, all Directors must retire at each AGM and may present themselves for election or re-election. The Company is mindful 
of the independence provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code and, in this regard, it is anticipated that Non-Executive Directors' 
overall tenure will not normally exceed nine years. The Chairman may terminate his appointment at any time, with three months' notice. 
None of the Non-Executive Directors has a notice period or any provision in his or her letter of appointment giving him, or her, a right to 
compensation payable upon early termination of appointment.

elected to prepare the Parent Company 
Financial Statements in accordance with 
UK Accounting Standards and applicable 
law (UK GAAP).
Under company law, the Directors must not 
approve the Financial Statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and Parent Company and of their profit or 
loss for that period. In preparing each of 
the Group and Parent Company Financial 
Statements, the Directors are required to:
 > select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently
 > make judgements and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent

Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness 
to future periods are subject to the risks 
that controls may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions or that 
the degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate.
The Directors assessed the effectiveness of 
AstraZeneca's internal control over financial 
reporting as at 31 December 2013 based 
on the criteria set forth by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission in Internal Control-Integrated 
Framework (1992). Based on this assessment, 
the Directors believe that, as at 31 December 
2013, the internal control over financial 
reporting is effective based on those criteria.
KPMG Audit Plc, an independent registered 
public accounting firm, has audited the 
effectiveness of internal control over 
financial reporting as at 31 December 2013 
and, as explained on page 126, has issued 
an unqualified report thereon.
The Directors are responsible for establishing 
and maintaining adequate internal control 
over financial reporting. AstraZeneca's 
internal control over financial reporting is 
designed to provide reasonable assurance 
over the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of consolidated Financial 
Statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles.
Due to its inherent limitations, internal 
control over financial reporting may 
not prevent or detect misstatements.
