 Directors' Remuneration Report

AT Communications Group plc
Report and Accounts 2007
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to
directors' remuneration. As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be
proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements
will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company's members on certain parts of the
Directors' Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the
report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. The report
has therefore been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
Directors' Remuneration Report
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee which
is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the
Combined Code. The members of the committee during 2007
were Bill Halbert and Gerry Spencer who are both independent
non-executive directors and the committee is chaired by Gerry
Spencer. In addition, Fred Hallsworth became a member of the
committee in February 2008.
None of the Remuneration Committee has any personal financial
interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interests arising
from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running
the business. The committee makes recommendations to the
Board. No director plays a part in any discussion about his
or her own remuneration.
In determining the directors' remuneration for the year, the
committee consulted Alex Tupman (Chief Executive Officer)
about its proposals. 
Remuneration policy for the executive directors
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract,
motivate and retain directors of the high calibre needed to maintain
the Group's position as a market leader and to reward them for
enhancing value to shareholders. The performance measurement
of the executive directors and key members of senior management
and the determination of their annual remuneration package are
undertaken by the Committee.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package
for executive directors and senior management:
  Basic annual salary;
  Benefits-in-kind;
  Annual bonus payments which cannot exceed
100% of basic salary;
  Share option incentives; and
  Pension arrangements.
The Company's policy is that a substantial proportion of the
remuneration of the executive directors should be performance-
related. As described below, executive directors may earn annual
incentive payments of up to 100% of their basic salary together
with the benefits of participation in share option schemes.
Executive directors are entitled to accept appointments outside
the Company providing that the Chairman's permission is sought.
Unaudited information Basic salary
Basic salaries are reviewed on a discretionary
basis. In deciding appropriate levels, the
Committee considers the Group as a whole
and relies on objective research. During the
year Alex Tupman's salary was increased by
20% to  240,000 per annum from 1 April
2007 and 4% to  250,000 per annum from
1 August 2007. Scott Kean's salary was
increased by 22% to  165,000 per annum
from 1 April 2007 and 6% to  175,000
per annum from 1 August 2007. Richard
Carter's salary was increased by 8.3% to
 130,000 per annum from 1 January 2007.
Benefits-in-kind
The executive directors receive certain
benefits-in-kind, principally a car allowance,
life assurance and private medical insurance.
Annual bonus payments
The Remuneration Committee establishes
the objectives that must be met for each
financial year if a cash bonus is to be paid.
In setting appropriate bonus parameters the
committee refers to the objective research as
noted above. 50% of basic salary is paid for
the achievement of financial targets set by
the committee with up to 100% paid for the
achievement of above target performance.
Share options
AT Communications Group plc operates
approved and unapproved discretionary
share option schemes for staff of the Group.
The Remuneration Committee decides which
individuals should participate and the extent
of their participation. Options granted under
the approved schemes are normally exercisable
no earlier than three and no later than ten
years from the date of grant. Options granted
under the unapproved schemes are normally
exercisable no earlier than one and no later
than ten years from the date of grant. 
Share options are awarded within the
scheme rules subject to HM Revenue 
and Customs rules. 
The executive directors are granted options
under the unapproved scheme. All options
are issued with an exercise price equivalent
to the share price on the day of issue.
No options are issued at a discount. The
exercise of options is not dependent on
performance criteria. 
The Company does not operate any
long-term incentive schemes other than
the share option schemes described above.
No significant amendments are proposed to
be made to the terms and conditions of any
entitlement of a director to share options.
Pension arrangements
AT Communications Group plc operates a
number of Stakeholder and Contracted-In
Money Purchase schemes where the
Company matches staff contributions up to
a maximum of 5%. In addition the executive
directors each received a contribution equal
to 10% of their basic salary which was paid
into a self-administered scheme. Access to
independent financial advice is provided to
all eligible staff to ensure that they are aware
of the need to make adequate provision for
retirement. Ian Crawley has opted to receive
additional pension contributions of
equivalent cost to the Company instead of
salary. He also received  64,000 in additional
pension contributions during the year and
will receive a further  32,000 in 2008 under
the terms of his contract.
