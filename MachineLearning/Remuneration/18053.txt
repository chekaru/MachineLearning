Directors' Remuneration Report
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee which
is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the
Combined Code. The members of the committee during 2008
were Gerry Spencer (Chairman) Fred Hallsworth and Bill Halbert
all are independent Non-Executive Directors.
None of the Remuneration Committee has any personal financial
interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interests arising
from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the
business. The committee makes recommendations to the Board.
No director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own
remuneration.
In determining the directors' remuneration for the year, the
committee consulted Alex Tupman (Chief Executive Officer)
about its proposals.
Remuneration policy for the executive directors
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract,
motivate and retain directors of the high calibre needed to maintain
the Group's position as a market leader and to reward them for
enhancing value to shareholders. The performance measurement 
of the executive directors and key members of senior management
and the determination of their annual remuneration package are
undertaken by the Committee.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package for
executive directors and senior management:
  basic annual salary;
  benefits-in-kind;
  annual bonus payments which cannot exceed 100% of basic salary;
  share option incentives; and
  pension arrangements.
The Company's policy is that a substantial proportion of the
remuneration of the executive directors should be performance-
related. As described below, executive directors may earn annual
incentive payments of up to 100% of their basic salary together
with the benefits of participation in share option schemes.
Executive directors are entitled to accept appointments outside 
the Company providing that the Chairman's permission is sought. Basic salary
Basic salaries are reviewed on a discretionary basis. In deciding
appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole 
and relies on objective research. During the year Alex Tupman's salary
was increased by 5.5% to  263,748 per annum from 1 January 2008.
Scott Kean's salary was increased by 5.5% to  184,623 per annum
from 1 January 2008. Andrew Parsliffe's salary was increased by
14.8% to  155,000. Richard Carter's salary was increased by 
19.2% to  155,000 per annum from 1 January 2008.
Benefits-in-kind
The executive directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, principally 
a car allowance, life assurance and private medical insurance.
Annual bonus payments
The Remuneration Committee establishes the objectives that must 
be met for each financial year if a cash bonus is to be paid. In setting
appropriate bonus parameters the committee refers to the objective
research as noted above. 50% of basic salary is paid for the
achievement of financial targets set by the committee with up 
to 100% paid for the achievement of above target performance.
It should be noted that the executive directors have opted to waive
their bonus entitlement for 2008 and that following the management
change and disposal of the Rocom business the Remuneration
Committee will be reassessing executive remuneration for 2009, 
by benchmarking the Group against comparable public companies.
Share options
AT Communications Group plc operates approved and unapproved
discretionary share option schemes for staff of the Group. 
The Remuneration Committee decides which individuals should
participate and the extent of their participation. Options granted 
under the approved schemes are normally exercisable no earlier
than three and no later than ten years from the date of grant.
Options granted under the unapproved schemes are normally
exercisable no earlier than one and no later than ten years from 
the date of grant. Share options are awarded within the scheme
rules subject to HM Revenue & Customs rules.
The executive directors are granted options under the unapproved
scheme. All options are issued with an exercise price equivalent to the
share price on the day of issue. No options are issued at a discount.
The exercise of options is not dependent on performance criteria.
The Company does not operate any long-term incentive schemes 
other than the share option schemes described above. No significant
amendments are proposed to be made to the terms and conditions 
of any entitlement of a director to share options.

Pension arrangements
AT Communications Group plc operates a number of Stakeholder
and Contracted-In Money Purchase schemes where the Company
matches staff contributions up to a maximum of 5%. In addition
the Executive Directors each received a contribution equal to 
10% of their basic salary which was paid into a self-administered
scheme. Access to independent financial advice is provided to all
eligible staff to ensure that they are aware of the need to make
adequate provision for retirement. Ian Crawley, to the date of his
resignation, opted to receive additional pension contributions of
equivalent cost to the Company instead of salary.
Directors' contracts
Each executive director has a rolling service contract with the
Company which may be terminated by either party with not less
than 12 months' notice. 
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors have letters of appointments, not service
contracts, which are terminable with 1 months' notice. Their
remuneration is determined by the board within the limits set by
the Articles of Association and based on independent surveys of
fees paid to non-executive directors of similar companies. The fees
paid are inclusive of all work undertaken including serving on
Committees and are set out in the table below.
The non-executive directors are granted options under the
unapproved scheme. All options are issued with an exercise price
equivalent to the share price on the day of issue. No options are
issued at a discount. The exercise of options is not dependent on
performance criteria.
