REMUNERATION REPORT 
Year ended 31 December 2005 
 
During the year the remuneration committee comprised W J C Douie and J Hustler. It was chaired by W J C Douie.  The 
committee determines an overall remuneration package for executive directors in order to attract and retain high quality 
executives capable of achieving the Group's objectives.  The package consists of basic salary, benefits, performance related 
bonuses and pensions.  The remuneration committee continues to give full consideration to provisions set out in section 1B 
(directors' remuneration) of The Combined Code in determining remuneration packages. 
The individual components of the remuneration package are discussed below. 
 
Basic salary and benefits 
Salary and benefits are reviewed annually. Benefits principally comprise a car and private healthcare, unless the option to 
take the cash alternative for a car has been taken, in which case the basic salary will have been increased. 
 
Share options 
The Group has formulated a policy for the granting of share options to directors and full time employees.  
 
Performance related bonuses 
For the year under review, bonuses were calculated based on the profit of the Group. 
 
Pensions 
The Company contributes 12.5% of C Chapman's and 5% of A Bailey's basic salary (excluding cash for car alternatives) to a 
money purchase pension scheme. The Company does not make any contributions in respect of other directors. 
 
Fees 
The fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Board within the limits stipulated in the Articles of Association.
