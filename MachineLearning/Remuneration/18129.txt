Introduction
Companies trading on AIM are not required to provide a formal remuneration report. However, in line with current best practice this report provides
information to enable a greater level of understanding as to how Directors' remuneration is determined.
The Remuneration Committee of the Board is responsible for considering Directors' remuneration packages and makes its recommendations to the
Board. The Committee comprises the three Non-executive Directors and meets at least once a year, normally in June.
Remuneration policy
Remuneration packages are designed to be competitive and to reward above average performance. Executive Directors receive salary, fully financed
company car, death in service benefit, critical illness and medical cover, pension contribution, annual bonuses and share options.
Service contracts
The Executive Directors have service agreements with the Company dated 28 November 2003 for an initial twelve months, thereafter subject to
termination upon twelve months' notice being given by either party.
Pensions
The Group does not have a pension scheme, instead makes contributions to Executive Directors' personal pension schemes of 12.5% of annual salary.
Performance incentives
The Group operates an annual cash bonus scheme and grants share options.
The annual bonus scheme provides for a maximum bonus of 30% of salary to be paid by reference to: achievement of a Group earnings target (10%);
surpassing the earnings target (10%) and individual personal targets (10%).
The Company has the following share incentive arrangements:
 
an Inland Revenue Approved Executive Share Option Scheme (Approved Scheme );
 
an Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme (Unapproved Scheme ); and
 
a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP ) (together the Schemes ).

the three year period from 1 October 2003 to 30 September 2006 is at least 64.42p. No consideration is to be paid by award holders on vesting.
None of the option shares or LTIP require payment to be made by participants to receive the benefit of an option.
