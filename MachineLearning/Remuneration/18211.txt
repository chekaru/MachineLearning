IntrOductIOn
Companies trading on AIM are not required to provide a formal Remuneration Report. However, in line with current best practice, this report 
provides information to enable a greater level of understanding as to how Directors' remuneration is determined. The Remuneration Committee 
of the Board is responsible for considering Directors' remuneration packages and makes its recommendations to the Board. The Committee 
comprises the three Non-executive Directors and meets at least once a year, normally in June. 
reMunerA tIOn POlIcy
Remuneration packages are designed to be competitive and to reward above average performance. Executive Directors receive salary, fully 
financed company car or car allowance, death in service benefit, critical illness and medical cover, pension contribution, annual bonuses 
and share options.

The Executive Directors have service agreements with the Company. Mr Tom Allchurch and Mr Alistair Black's agreements are dated 
28 November 2003 for an initial twelve months, thereafter subject to termination upon twelve months' notice being given by either party. 
Mr Steven Beaumont's agreement is dated 9 October 2006 with an initial notice period of six months which increased to twelve months
