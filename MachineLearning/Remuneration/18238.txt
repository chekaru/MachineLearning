IntrOductIOn
Companies trading on AIM are not required to provide a formal remuneration report. However, in line with current best practice, 
this report provides information to enable a greater level of understanding as to how Directors' remuneration is determined. 
The Remuneration Committee of the Board is responsible for considering Directors' remuneration packages and makes its 
recommendations to the Board. The Committee comprises the three Non executive Directors and meets at least once a year, 
normally in June. 
reMunerA tIOn POlIcy
Remuneration packages are designed to be competitive and to reward above average performance. Executive Directors receive
