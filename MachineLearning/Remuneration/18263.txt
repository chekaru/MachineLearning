Remuneration committee report
Introduction
Companies trading on AIM are not required to provide a full formal remuneration report, only disclosure as to the remuneration 
earned in respect of the financial year by each director acting in such capacity during the financial year. However, in line with current 
best practice, this report provides information to enable a greater level of understanding as to how Directors' remuneration is 
determined. The Remuneration Committee of the Board is responsible for considering Directors' remuneration packages and makes 
its recommendations to the Board. The Committee comprises the two Non-executive Directors and meets at least once a year, 
normally in June.
Remuneration policy
Remuneration packages after taking advice from independent remuneration consultants are designed to be competitive and 
to reward above average performance. Executive Directors receive salary, a fully financed company car or car allowance, death 
in service benefit, critical illness and medical cover, pension contribution, annual bonuses and share options.
Service contracts
Mr Alistair Black's agreement is dated 14 June 2011 terminable upon twelve months' notice being given by either party. Mr David Port 
entered into a letter of appointment dated 12 May 2004, amended on 6 December 2011 to reflect Mr Port's appointment as 
Executive Chairman, which requires twelve months' notice to be given by either party. Mr Andrew Weatherstone has a service 
agreement dated 13 June 2011 also terminable upon twelve months' notice being given by either party.
Non-executive Directors
Mr Vaughan Williams entered into a letter of appointment dated 12 May 2004 which was renewed in October 2009. Mr Williams 
was appointed for an initial three year term, which can be terminated upon six months' notice being given by either party. Mr Tim Stokeld 
was appointed as an Independent Non-executive Director on 6 May 2009 and the appointment is subject to an annual review and 
can be terminated upon three months' notice being given by either party.
Following the sale of the ATH Regeneration assets, the Group entered into an arrangement with RecyCoal Limited for the provision 
of the services of Mr Tom Allchurch as a Non-executive Director which was terminated on the resignation of Mr Allchurch on 
18 January 2011.
