REMUNERATION POLICY
Executive Directors' remuneration packages consist of various components and may contain any or all of the
following:
Basic salary Pension contributions Car allowance Performance linked bonus
Share options Life assurance Private healthcare insurance
SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
Our ability to attract, retain and motivate Directors, senior managers and staff of appropriate calibre and
experience is essential to the success of the Group. The Remuneration Committee's primary responsibility is
to ensure that the Company policy supports this objective whilst avoiding unnecessary cost.
COMPANY BONUS SCHEME
The short-term reward for employees and Directors is in the form of a bonus scheme. Performance related
elements of remuneration form a significant proportion of executives' total remuneration packages and have
been designed to align the executive interests with those of shareholders. The bonus scheme is based on
total Group profitability, including stretch targets for the Group. Individual bonus schemes have been put in
place where appropriate in which to reach a maximum payment would require exceptional achievement,
substantially out performing budget targets. Bonus payments are not pensionable.
PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS
The Group operates a contributory money purchase pension scheme for the benefit of all employees. Basic
salary only is pensionable. Pension contributions for most employees are available through salary sacrifice,
which is matched up to a maximum Company contribution of 5%. Pension contributions on behalf of the
Managing Director are 10% before any salary sacrifice.
SHARE OPTIONS 
Share options are a means by which the Group rewards and motivates employees and Directors in the
medium to long term.  If the Group achieves targets and the full bonus is paid this will increase the share price,
which will lead to more long-term benefits for employees and shareholders alike. Executive Directors' share
option details are given in the Directors' Report, and employee share options details are given in the share
capital note 17 to the accounts. Share options can be awarded based on two criteria, merit or attracting new
senior employees to the Company. 
The more committed and focused employees are, the more successful the Group will be and the more reward
the employees will receive, not just financially but also from a personal sense of achievement, job satisfaction,
security, and the enjoyment of working together as a team.
DIRECTORS' EMOLUMENTS 
The total amount paid to the Directors for their services in the year to 31 December 2002 was  228,000
(2001:  161,000).
