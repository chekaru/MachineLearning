directors' remuneration report
The remuneration committee
The two members of the committee are both non-executive directors.
The members of the committee are Stewart Douglas-Mann (chairman)
and Peter Bertram.
Executive directors may also, upon request by the committee, attend
meetings of the committee except where their own remuneration is
being reviewed.
The committee's principal responsibilities to the board and
shareholders are:
.
to review the performance of the company's executive directors;
.
to provide senior executive management with appropriate incentives
to enhance the group's performance;
.
to ensure that the group's executive directors and senior executives
are fairly, but responsibly, rewarded for their individual contributions
to the group's overall performance by determining their pay, any
bonuses and other remuneration;
.
to consider the allocation of share options together with any
attached performance targets to directors and employees; and
.
to demonstrate to all shareholders that the remuneration of the senior
executive members of the group is set by a committee of the board
members who have no personal interest in the outcome of the
decisions and who will give due regard to the interests of the
shareholders and to the financial and commercial health of the group.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
The remuneration policy in respect of the executive directors is to
ensure that their total remuneration should be sufficient to attract,
motivate and retain executive directors of the calibre required.
Additionally the use of performance-driven cash and equity based
rewards in addition to base salary and benefits should ensure that the
interests of the executives are aligned with those of the shareholders.
Value from bonus and share option schemes must be related to
company performance and any performance targets must be clear,
easily understood and stretching.
The current elements of the remuneration packages are as follows:-
Basic salary
The salary of each executive director is subject to review in December
2004 by the committee in accordance with the policy detailed above.
The executive directors' base salaries at 30 September 2004 are
as follows:-
Salary per annum
David Webber (Chief Executive)  150,000
Philip Wood (Finance Director)  85,000
Benefits
Benefits include the provisions of a company car or allowance, private
medical insurance for the executive directors and their families, life
assurance (a multiple of four times each executive director's base
salary) and permanent health insurance.
Pensions
The company contributes 10% of base salary to the personal pension
schemes of the executive directors.
Annual performance related bonus
The annual bonus plan is paid against financial targets that include
profit before tax, net margin performance and cash flow and personal
key business objectives. Bonus payments are non-pensionable and are
payable after the group's results have been audited. The annual bonus
structure for the year ending 30 September 2004 was implemented on
10 March 2004. The annual bonus structure for the year ending 30
September 2005 was implemented on 18 November 2004.
Share option schemes
The executive directors participate in the EMI Plan and the Unapproved
Plan. Both schemes are considered to be a major element of management
retention and motivation over a three year period and align the interests
of the executive directors with those of the shareholders.
Common to both schemes are the performance targets set on 25 March
2004. The performance targets are based on the growth in earnings per
share, in real terms, of the company, for each of the three financial
years ending 30 September 2004, 2005 and 2006 divided by three over
the period commencing 1 October 2003 and ending on 30 September
2006 having to exceed six per cent.
Introduction
As a member of AIM the company is not obliged
to comply with the provisions of the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, however,
as part of its commitment to best corporate
governance practice the company has approached
the preparation of this directors' remuneration
report as if was required to comply with the
regulations. Consequently, this directors'
remuneration report has been approved by
the board and, in accordance with the
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, will be
submitted to shareholders for approval at the

January 2005. Directors' remuneration report
page 23
Following 30 September 2006 the committee shall procure the auditors
to certify whether or not the performance criteria have been satisfied.
The following is a summary of the three share option schemes operated
by the company:-
The Sharesave Plan
All eligible employees, including the executive directors, were invited
on 14 June 2004 to contribute up to  250 per month over a three-year
term to purchase the company's shares at 59 pence per share - a discount
of 10% of the market price at that time. This scheme is approved by the
Inland Revenue.
The EMI Plan
Through this plan the executive directors and a number of eligible
employees were invited to participate. Options are granted at market
value and performance conditions apply to this plan. No individual may
hold greater than  100,000 of options under the EMI Plan.
The Unapproved Plan
Through this plan the executive directors and a number of employees
were invited to participate. Options are granted at market value and
performance conditions apply to this plan. There are no individual
participation limits under the Unapproved Plan.
Service contracts
Each of the executive directors has a service agreement with the
company entered into on 25 March 2004, which sets out his basic terms
and conditions of employment.
Each executive director's service contract is terminable on twelve
months' notice by either the company or the respective executive
director unless there is a change of control. In the event of a change of
control then:
a) if the company serves notice on the executive director to terminate
his service agreement within the period of twelve months following the
change of control whether or not with immediate effect for any reason
(save for a reason justifying summary dismissal), the period of notice
which must be served by the company increases to two years;
b) if the company serves notice on the executive director to terminate
his service agreement within the period of twelve months following the
change of control whether or not with immediate effect for any reason
(save for a reason justifying summary dismissal) or if the company
acts in a manner which would otherwise enable the executive director
to resign without notice and treat himself as being dismissed, the
company shall pay him a sum equivalent to two years' salary as at the
date of the change of control. Total Shareholder Return
