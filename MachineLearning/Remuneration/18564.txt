Directors' remuneration report
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee comprises the non-executive directors and is chaired by Roger McDowell. The principal 
objective of the remuneration committee is to attract, retain and motivate talented people with a competitive package 
of incentives and awards linked to performance and the interests of shareholders.
The committee appointed New Bridge Street Consultants LLP to provide independent advice during the year, in particular 
in connection with the establishment of a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP).
Current remuneration package
The current remuneration package of the executive directors comprises:
(i) Basic salaries
Basic salaries for executive directors take into account the performance, experience and responsibilities of the individuals 
concerned, as well as the salaries of those with similar positions and responsibilities. External advice is taken as appropriate 
and basic salaries are reviewed annually.
(ii) Performance related bonus
The executive directors participate in a bonus scheme applicable to all senior management based on annual profit targets 
approved by the remuneration committee. The achievement of these targets would result in a bonus of 50% of basic salary. 
In 2007, no bonus was payable to executive directors under this scheme.
(iii) Pension provision and other benefits
Pension provision is made at a rate of 10% of basic salary for executive directors, which is payable directly into a nominated 
pension fund. Other benefits for executive directors include a car allowance, life assurance and private healthcare.
(iv) LTIP
During the year under review, the remuneration committee introduced an LTIP , following consultation with institutional 
shareholders and external advice on executive remuneration. Under the LTIP senior employees may be granted an award 
annually of up to 100% of basic salary. The award vests in the form of shares in the company and is subject to the attainment 
of pre-determined performance conditions over a three year period. For the 2007 award, participants will receive 100% of the 
award if the group's normalised pre-tax earnings per share over the three year period to 31 December 2009 increases by at 
least 30% compound per annum. No award will vest unless the annual compound growth rate is at least 15%, at which level 
30% of the award would apply.
(v) Share options
Before the introduction of the LTIP , share options were granted to directors and senior management. These share options 
have no performance criteria. It is not the intention of the remuneration committee to grant share options on a regular basis 
in the future.
Service contracts
Executive directors have rolling service contracts with notice periods of not more than twelve months. Augean PLC
