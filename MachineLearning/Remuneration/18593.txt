DIreCtors' remuneratIon report
remuneration committee
The remuneration committee comprises the non executive directors and is chaired by Roger McDowell. The principal 
objective of the remuneration committee is to attract, retain and motivate talented people with a competitive package 
of incentives and awards linked to performance and the interests of shareholders.
The committee uses the services of independent external advisers as required.
Remuneration of the non executive directors, including the chairman, is determined by the board as a whole. Subsequent 
to the period under review, all non executive directors have agreed to reduce their remuneration by a minimum of 10%.
Current remuneration package
The current remuneration package of the executive directors comprises:
(i) Basic salaries
Basic salaries for executive directors take into account the performance, experience and responsibilities of the individuals 
concerned, as well as the salaries of those with similar positions and responsibilities. External advice is taken as appropriate 
and basic salaries are reviewed annually. No increases have been applied to executive directors' salaries for the past two years.
(ii) Performance related bonus
The executive directors participate in a bonus scheme applicable to all senior management based on annual profit targets 
approved by the remuneration committee. The achievement of these targets would result in a bonus of 50% of basic salary. 
No bonus has been awarded in respect of 2009.
(iii) Pension provision and other benefits
Pension provision is made at a rate of 10% of basic salary for executive directors, which is payable directly into a nominated 
pension fund. Other benefits for executive directors include a car allowance, life assurance and private healthcare.
(iv) Long Term Incentive Plan
Under the LTIP senior employees may be granted an award annually of up to 100% of basic salary. The award vests in the 
form of shares in the company and is subject to the attainment of pre determined performance conditions over a three year 
period. For the 2009 award, participants will receive 100% of the award if the group's normalised pre tax profit in the year 
ended 31 December 2011 is  11.3m. No award will vest unless the profit is at least  3.3m, at which level 30% of the award 
would apply.
(v) Share options
Following the placing during the year and in recognition of the changed targets for the company in a much altered marketplace, 
share options were granted to directors and senior management. These share options have no performance criteria. It is not 
the intention of the remuneration committee to grant share options on a regular basis in the future.
service contracts
Executive directors have rolling service contracts with notice periods of not more than twelve months.
