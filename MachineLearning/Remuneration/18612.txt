Directors' remuneration report
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee comprises the non-executive directors and is chaired by Roger McDowell. The principal objective 
of the remuneration committee is to attract, retain and motivate talented people with a competitive package of incentives and 
awards linked to performance and the interests of shareholders.
The committee uses the services of independent external advisers as required.
Remuneration of the non-executive directors, including the chairman, is determined by the board as a whole. Subsequent to 
the period under review, the remuneration committee has agreed to review the long term incentives available to all directors 
and ensure that these are adequately aligned with the interests of shareholders.
Current remuneration package
The current remuneration package of the executive directors comprises:
(i) Basic salaries
Basic salaries for executive directors take into account the performance, experience and responsibilities of the individuals concerned, 
as well as the salaries of those with similar positions and responsibilities. External advice is taken as appropriate and basic 
salaries are reviewed annually. No increases have been applied to executive directors' salaries for the past three years.
(ii) Performance related bonus
The executive directors participate in a bonus scheme applicable to all senior management based on annual profit targets 
approved by the remuneration committee. The achievement of these targets would result in a bonus of 50% of basic salary. 
No bonus has been awarded in respect of 2010.
(iii) Pension provision and other benefits
Pension provision is made at a rate of 10% of basic salary for executive directors, which is payable directly into a nominated 
pension fund. Other benefits for executive directors include a car allowance, life assurance and private healthcare.
(iv) Long Term Incentive Plan
Under the Long T erm Incentive Plan (LTIP) senior employees may be granted an award annually of up to 100% of basic salary. 
The award vests in the form of shares in the company and is subject to the attainment of pre-determined performance conditions 
over a three year period. For the 2009 award, participants will receive 100% of the award if the group's normalised pre-tax 
profit in the year ending 31 December 2011 is  11.3m. No award will vest unless the profit is at least  3.3m, at which level 
30% of the award would apply. No award was made in 2010 and the LTIP scheme is currently subject to a review by the 
remuneration committee.
(v) Share options
Consistent with the revised policy, since December 2009, no share options were granted during 2010. The use of share 
options is currently subject to a review by the remuneration committee.
Service contracts
Executive directors have rolling service contracts with notice periods of not more than twelve months. Corporate governance >
