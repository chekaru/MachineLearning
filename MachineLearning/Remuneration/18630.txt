Review of the year Corporate governance Financial statements
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee comprises the non-executive directors and is chaired by Roger McDowell. The principal 
objective of the remuneration committee is to attract, retain and motivate talented people with a competitive package 
of incentives and awards linked to performance and the interests of shareholders. The committee uses the services 
of independent external advisers as required.
Remuneration of the non-executive directors, including the chairman, is determined by the board as a whole. 
Current remuneration package
The current remuneration package of the executive directors comprises:
(i) Basic salaries
Basic salaries for executive directors take into account the performance, experience and responsibilities of the individuals 
concerned, as well as the salaries of those with similar positions and responsibilities. External advice is taken as appropriate 
and basic salaries are reviewed annually. No increases have been applied to executive directors' salaries for the past 
four years.
(ii) Performance related bonus
The executive directors participate in a bonus scheme based on the achievement of annual profit targets approved by the 
remuneration committee. The achievement of these targets would result in a bonus of up to 50% of basic salary. No bonus 
was awarded in respect of 2011.
(iii) Pension provision and other benefits
Pension provision is made at a rate of 10% of basic salary for executive directors, which is payable directly into a nominated 
pension fund. Other benefits include a car allowance, life assurance and private healthcare.
(iv)Long Term Incentive Plan
Under the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP') senior employees may be granted an award annually of up to 100% of basic 
salary. The award vests in the form of shares in the company and is subject to the attainment of pre-determined performance 
conditions over a three year period. The expected costs of the scheme are given in note 18 to the financial statements.
No LTIP award was made in 2011. The remuneration committee reviewed the LTIP scheme during the year and concluded 
that it remained a suitable mechanism to incentivise future performance. They resolved to consider making new awards 
to the executive directors during 2012. 
(v) Share options
Under the share options scheme the remuneration committee may annually grant options of up to 100% of basic salary 
to purchase shares in the company at a future date. These options may be subject to the attainment of pre-determined 
performance conditions but this is not an absolute requirement. 
The remuneration committee reviewed the use of share options during the year and concluded that the scheme remained 
a suitable mechanism to incentive future performance. Awards were made to the executive directors during the year, 
as shown in the Director's share plans section of this report.
Service contracts
Executive directors have rolling service contracts with notice periods of not more than twelve months.
