 40 Augean PLC Annual Report 2012 www.augeanplc.com
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Non-executive Directors and is chaired by Roger McDowell. The principal 
objective of the Remuneration Committee is to attract, retain and motivate talented people with a competitive package 
of incentives and awards linked to performance and the interests of shareholders. The Committee uses the services 
of independent external advisers as required.
Remuneration of the Non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, is determined by the Board as a whole. 
Current remuneration package
The current remuneration package of the Executive Directors comprises:
(i) Basic salaries
Basic salaries for Executive Directors take into account the performance, experience and responsibilities of the individuals 
concerned, as well as the salaries of those with similar positions and responsibilities. External advice is taken as appropriate 
and basic salaries are reviewed annually. During 2012 Executive Directors' salaries were increased by 2%, in line with all 
employees of the Group.
(ii) Performance related bonus
The Executive Directors participate in a bonus scheme based on the achievement of annual profit targets approved by the 
Remuneration Committee. The achievement of these targets would result in a bonus of up to 50% of basic salary. No bonus 
was awarded in respect of 2012.
(iii) Pension provision and other benefits
Pension provision is made at a rate of 10% of basic salary for Executive Directors and is payable directly into a nominated 
pension fund. Other benefits include a car allowance, life assurance and private healthcare.
(iv) Long Term Incentive Plan
Under the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) senior employees may be granted an annual award of up to 100% of basic salary. 
The award vests in the form of shares in the Company and is subject to the attainment of pre-determined performance 
conditions over a three year period. The expected costs of the scheme are given in note 20 to the financial statements.
One LTIP award was made in 2012, the details of which are disclosed in note 20. The scheme was based on performance 
criteria which were not met during the year and as a consequence this award lapsed at the end of the year. The Remuneration 
Committee reviewed the LTIP scheme during the year and concluded that it remained a suitable mechanism to incentivise 
future performance. The Committee resolved to consider making new awards to the Executive Directors during 2013. 
(v) Share options
Under the share options scheme the Remuneration Committee may annually grant options of up to 100% of basic salary 
to purchase shares in the Company at a future date. These options may be subject to the attainment of pre-determined 
performance conditions but this is not an absolute requirement. 
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the use of share options during the year and concluded that the scheme remained 
a suitable mechanism to incentivise future performance. No awards were made to the Executive Directors during 2012, 
as shown in the Directors' share plans section of this report.
Service contracts
Executive Directors have rolling service contracts with notice periods of not more than twelve months.
