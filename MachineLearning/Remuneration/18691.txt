 Non-executive directors
Remuneration of the non-executive directors, including 
the chairman, is determined by the Board as a whole. 
Current remuneration package
The current remuneration package of the executive 
directors comprises:
(i) Basic salaries
Basic salaries for executive directors take into account 
the performance, experience and responsibilities of the 
individuals concerned, as well as the salaries of those 
with similar positions and responsibilities. External advice 
is taken as appropriate and basic salaries are reviewed 
annually. 
During 2013 no inflationary pay award was made to 
the executive directors. The salary of the group finance 
director was amended during the period he acted 
as interim chief executive, reflecting the increased 
responsibilities assumed as part of that role. Once the 
new chief executive officer joined the Group the group 
finance director's salary returned to the same base value 
as at the start of the year.
(ii) Performance related bonus
The executive directors participate in a bonus scheme 
based on the achievement of annual profit targets 
approved by the remuneration committee. The 
achievement of these targets would result in a bonus of 
up to 50% of basic salary. No bonus was awarded in 
respect of 2013.
(iii) Pension provision and other benefits
Pension provision is made at a rate of 10% of basic 
salary for each executive director, payable directly into 
a nominated pension fund. Other benefits include a car 
allowance, life assurance and private healthcare.
(iv) Long Term Incentive Plan
Under the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) senior 
employees may be granted an annual award of up to 
100% of basic salary, with the chief executive officer 
eligible for an award up to 200% of salary. The award 
vests in the form of shares in the Company and is 
subject to the attainment of pre-determined performance 
conditions over a three year period. The expected 
costs of the scheme are given in note 21 to the financial 
statements.
No LTIP award was made during the year. The 
remuneration committee resolved to consider making new 
awards once a renewed scheme had been developed 
(as set out in the Remuneration Committee Report), the 
new chief executive officer had become established within 
his role and the revised strategy for the Group had been 
published.
(v) Share options
Under the share options scheme the remuneration 
committee may annually grant options of up to 100% 
of basic salary, allowing participants to purchase shares 
in the Company at a future date. These options may be 
subject to the attainment of pre-determined performance 
conditions but this is not an absolute requirement. 
The remuneration committee reviewed the use of share 
options during the year and concluded that the scheme 
remained a suitable mechanism to incentivise future 
performance. One award was made during 2013, being 
the award of 1 million shares to the chief executive officer 
following his appointment to the role in August 2013. This 
award is shown in the tables below.
(vi) Service contracts
Executive directors have rolling service contracts with 
notice periods of not more than twelve months.
