The remuneration committee presents the Directors' remuneration report for the period ended 31 December 2012.
A Remuneration Committee comprising of two Non-Executive Directors and one Executive Director was established 
to make recommendations to the Board on the Company's policy and structure for all remuneration of the Directors 
and senior management.
The purpose of the Remuneration Committee is to review the remuneration policy for the Directors and other senior 
management and to determine the level of remuneration package in order to attract, motivate and retain talent. The 
Remuneration Committee will consult with the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer in respect of 
their recommendations in determining the remuneration of the Directors and senior management.
REMUNERATION POLICY
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the necessary 
calibre and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The performance measurement of the Executive 
Directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration package is 
undertaken by the Remuneration Committee. The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by 
the Board, and within the limits set out in the Articles of Association. Executive Directors are entitled to accept 
appointments outside the Company providing the Board's permission is sought.
The Non-Executive Directors remuneration is determined by the Board, having regard to the level of fees payable 
to Non-Executive Directors in the industry generally, the role that individual Directors fulfill in respect of Board and 
Committee responsibilities and the time committed to the Company's affairs. The policy of the Board is to review the 
level of Directors' fees and remuneration from time to time.
TERMS OF APPOINTMENT
The Executive Directors have service contracts with the Company or subsidiary in addition to their appointment as 
Directors of the Company. The Company's policy is that Directors have contracts for an indefinite term, providing for 
a maximum of six months notice.
The terms of their appointment determine that at every Annual General Meeting one-third of the Directors are 
bound to retire and be subjected to reappointment by Shareholders. The terms also determine that the contract is to 
continue until termination by either party giving six months' notice or by resolution of the shareholders. There are no 
liquidated damages or other compensation payable by the Company upon early termination of the Directors.
