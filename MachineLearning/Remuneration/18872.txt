Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee ) comprises the two non-executive directors and is chaired by 
Mr Deighton. Other than previously disclosed, no member of the committee has any personal financial interest (other
than as shareholders), conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the
business. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board. No director plays a part in any discussion about his
or her own remuneration. In determining the directors' remuneration for the year, the Committee consulted Mr Ripoll
(the then Chairman) about its proposals prior to the Acquisition and has consulted Mr Thompson (CEO) subsequently.
The Committee meets as and when appropriate during the year and is responsible for determining all aspects of the
executive directors' remuneration, including share options and the terms and conditions of their service contracts.
Remuneration policy
The policy of the Board is to motivate and retain the best executive directors by rewarding them with competitive salary
and benefit packages linked to achieving the Group's strategic goals. Performance targets set by the Committee for
bonus and incentive schemes are intended to be stretching and reward superior performance.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors and senior management:
  Basic salaries that are reviewed annually having regard to individual performance, responsibility and skills.
Executive directors also receive benefits-in-kind comprising private medical insurance and a car or equivalent allowance;
  Performance related annual bonuses that are calculated by reference to a combination of Group profit targets and 
individual performance targets;
  Share option incentives under the Long T erm Incentive Plan ( LTIP') and other share option schemes which are linked 
to the long-term performance of the Company and thus align the executives' interests with those of the 
shareholders. The extent to which an award under the LTIP will vest and thus become exercisable, is measured by 
reference to the growth in the Group's earnings per share over the performance period; and
  The executive directors are members of defined contribution pension schemes and annual contributions are 
calculated by reference to basic salaries with neither annual bonuses nor awards under the share incentive schemes 
taken into account in calculating the amounts due.
Share Options
A LTIP exists for executive directors of the Company and key senior executives of the Group which involves the award
of options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company at nil cost. The ability to exercise these options will be
dependent on the Group's performance over a plan cycle compared to objective performance targets set by the
Committee and agreed with the Board at the commencement of each plan cycle. It is intended that the performance
targets will be demanding.
The actual number of shares to be placed under option to individual participants will depend on a number of factors,
including their level of seniority in the Group. No options are currently in issue under the Plan.

Certain executive directors also have options granted to them under the terms of the 1988 and 1998 Executive Share
Option schemes which are open to all employees although, following the introduction of the LTIP scheme, the executive
directors are not eligible to acquire new options. Under that scheme, options are allocated to qualifying employees by
reference to profit for the year and basic salary.The exercise of options granted under the various schemes is not
dependent upon performance criteria.The exercise price of the options granted under these schemes is equal to the
market value of the Company's shares at the time when the options are granted. No options were granted to or
exercised by executive directors during the year.
Pension arrangements
Certain executive directors are members of the Company's Executive pension scheme, which is a defined contribution
scheme for directors and other senior employees of the Group. In addition, directors may elect that the Group pays an
amount deducted from their salary into a separate executive pension scheme of their choice. The contribution rate into
the scheme was 13% (2004: 13%). Mr Ripoll did not receive any contribution towards his pension during the year.
Performance

the FTSE support services sector, which the directors view as the most appropriate measure of comparative performance.
Directors service contracts

All executive directors have rolling service contracts with the Company which are subject to 12 months' notice of
termination by either party.
Non-Executive Directors
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts with the Company, but the appointment of each is recorded
in writing in accordance with guidance under the Combined Code. Their remuneration is determined by the Board
within limits set by the Articles of Association. Non-Executives cannot participate in any of the Company's share option
schemes and are not eligible to join the Company's pension scheme.

which rallied briefly in March 2004 at the same time
as an EGM called to replace certain management.
