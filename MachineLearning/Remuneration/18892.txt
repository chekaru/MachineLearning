Political and charitable contributions
No political contributions were made during the year. Charitable contributions made during the year
amounted to  352 (2001:  1,234).
Share capital
The Board is seeking from shareholders at the Annual General Meeting renewal of its authority to allot
equity securities up to a maximum aggregate nominal value of  241,404 (representing approximately 33
per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company). The directors have no present intention of
allotting any ordinary shares under this authority.
A resolution will also be put to the Annual General Meeting in respect of the issue of equity securities for
cash up to an aggregate nominal value of  36,211, representing five per cent of the issued ordinary share
capital, without first offering such shares to shareholders.  The directors consider this authority desirable
as it will give them the flexibility to make small issues of ordinary shares for cash as suitable opportunities
arise without the necessity of first seeking shareholders' approval.
The renewed authorities will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company
when it is intended that the directors will again seek their renewal.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 28 January 2003, the Company had been informed of the following notifiable interests of three per
cent or more in its share capital:
Ordinary 1p shares Percentage of
ordinary share capital
Imagina Management SL 9,865,192 13.62
Aimshot Limited 4,000,000 5.52
R H Warner (a former director of the Company) 2,689,012 3.71
Apart from these substantial shareholdings, the directors are not aware of any interest of three per cent or
more in the share capital of the Company. Aukett Group Plc annual report and accounts 2002 17

Impact of the Euro
Europe's single currency, the Euro, was adopted for all purposes in those countries participating on 
1 January 2002. Sterling will continue unaffected for use in the UK. The systems and processes in the
Group's European offices have been refined to deal with the Euro and no material problems have been
encountered.
Costs to date have been fully expensed and any future costs will be treated likewise. The directors do not
believe that any future introduction of the Euro in the UK would be material to the Group's financial
condition, operations or liquidity.
Auditors
A resolution is to be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting for the re-appointment of
KPMG Audit Plc as auditors of the Company.

The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) comprises the two non-executive directors and is
chaired by Mr IGF Mavor. The remuneration policies of the Group embody the principles of good
governance set out in section 1 of the Combined Code.
The Committee meets as and when appropriate during the year and is responsible for determining all
aspects of the executive directors' remuneration, including share options and the terms and conditions of
their service contracts. Full details of the directors' remuneration are set out in the table below.
An annual bonus scheme exists for executive directors under which bonuses become payable upon the
achievement of certain financial targets. No bonuses are payable in respect of the year ended 
30 September 2002 under this scheme. 
A long term share incentive plan (the Plan) exists for executive directors of the Company and key senior
executives of the Group which involves the award of options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company at
nil cost. The ability to exercise these options will be dependent on the Group's performance over a plan
cycle compared to objective performance targets set by the Committee and agreed with the Board at the
commencement of each plan cycle. It is intended that the performance targets will be demanding.
The actual number of shares to be placed under option to individual participants will depend on a number
of factors, including their level of seniority in the Group. No options were granted to executive directors
during the year. Cumulative details of options granted in prior years are set out below.
The number of shares that may be acquired upon exercise of the option after the end of the plan cycle
will depend upon the Group's actual performance over the plan cycle. Options will normally be granted
within 42 days of the announcement by the Company of its interim or final results each year, although
options may be granted outside these periods if the Committee considers that there are sufficiently
exceptional circumstances to justify the grant of options at that time.
The Committee has determined that outstanding performance for the purposes of the first plan cycle, for
the three financial years ending 30 September 2003, will be equivalent to 20% compound growth per
annum in the consolidated fully diluted earnings per share of the Company, adjusted to take out the effect
of exceptional items, over the plan cycle, calculated on an aggregate basis. Similarly the Committee has
determined that, for the purposes of the first plan cycle, below average performance will be compound
growth in fully diluted adjusted earnings per share of less than 7.5% per annum.
All executive directors are members of the Company's Executive pension scheme, which is a defined
contribution scheme for directors and other senior employees of the Group. The contribution rate into the
scheme was 27.5% of basic salary for the year ended 30 September 2002 for Messrs Lett, Thake and
Harwood (2001: 27.5%) and 20% for Mr Warner (2001: 20%). In addition, directors may elect that the
Group pays an amount deducted from their salary into a separate executive pension scheme of their
choice.
The Committee is responsible for the issue of share options to executive directors under the terms of the
Company's executive share option schemes. No options were granted to or exercised by executive
directors during the year but details of options granted in prior years are set out below.
The fees of the non-executive directors are determined by the executive directors.
