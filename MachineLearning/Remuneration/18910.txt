Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) comprises the two non-executive directors and is
chaired by Mr I G F Mavor. Neither member of the committee has any personal financial interest (other
than as shareholders), conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in
running the business. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board. No director plays a part in
any discussion about his or her own remuneration. In determining the directors' remuneration for the year,
the Committee consulted Mr G C Harwood (Group Managing Director) about its proposals.
The Committee meets as and when appropriate during the year and is responsible for determining all
aspects of the executive directors' remuneration, including share options and the terms and conditions of
their service contracts. 
The fees of the non-executive directors are determined by the executive directors.
Remuneration policy
The policy of the Board is to motivate and retain the best executive directors by rewarding them with
competitive salary and benefit packages linked to achieving the Group's strategic goals. Performance
targets set by the Committee for bonus and incentive schemes are intended to be stretching and reward
superior performance.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors and senior management:
  Basic annual salary that is reviewed annually having regard to individual performance, responsibility 
and skills. Executive directors also receive benefits-in-kind comprising private medical insurance and a car 
or equivalent allowance;
  Performance related annual bonuses, up to a maximum of 75% of the executive directors' salary, that 
are calculated by reference to a combination of Group profit targets and individual performance targets;
  Share option incentives under the Long Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP') and other share option schemes 
which are linked to the long-term performance of the Company and thus align the executives' interests 
with those of the shareholders. The extent to which an award under the LTIP will vest and thus become 
exercisable, is measured by reference to the growth in the Group's earnings per share over the 
performance period; and
  The executive directors are members of defined contribution pension schemes and annual 
contributions are calculated by reference to basic salaries with neither annual bonuses nor awards 
under the share incentive schemes taken into account in calculating the amounts due.
The Company's policy is that an important part of the remuneration of executive directors should be
performance related.
Share Options
A long term share incentive plan (the Plan) exists for executive directors of the Company and key senior
executives of the Group which involves the award of options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company at
nil cost. The ability to exercise these options will be dependent on the Group's performance over a plan
cycle compared to objective performance targets set by the Committee and agreed with the Board at the
commencement of each plan cycle. It is intended that the performance targets will be demanding.
The actual number of shares to be placed under option to individual participants will depend on a number
of factors, including their level of seniority in the Group. No options were granted to executive directors
during the year.

Cumulative details of options granted in prior years are set out below.
The number of shares that may be acquired upon exercise of the option after the end of the plan cycle
will depend upon the Group's actual performance over the plan cycle. Options will normally be granted
within 42 days of the announcement by the Company of its interim or final results each year, although
options may be granted outside these periods if the Committee considers that there are sufficiently
exceptional circumstances to justify the grant of options at that time. 
The Committee determined that outstanding performance for the purposes of the first plan cycle, for the
three financial years ended 30 September 2003, would be equivalent to 20% compound growth per
annum in the consolidated fully diluted earnings per share of the Company, adjusted to take out the effect
of exceptional items, over the plan cycle, calculated on an aggregate basis. Similarly the Committee
determined that, for the purposes of the first plan cycle, below average performance will be compound
growth in fully diluted adjusted earnings per share of less than 7.5% per annum. These performance
targets were not met and all options under the plan have now lapsed.
The executive directors also have options granted to them under the terms of the 1988 and 1998
Executive Share Option schemes which are open to all employees although, following the introduction of
the LTIP scheme, the executive directors are not eligible to acquire new options. Under that scheme,
options are allocated to qualifying employees by reference to profit for the year and basic salary. The
exercise of options granted under the various schemes are not dependent upon performance criteria. The
exercise price of the options granted under these schemes is equal to the market value of the Company's
shares at the time when the options are granted. No options were granted to or exercised by executive
directors during the year.
Pension arrangements
All executive directors are members of the Company's Executive pension scheme, which is a defined
contribution scheme for directors and other senior employees of the Group. The contribution rate into the
scheme was 27.5% of basic salary for the year ended 30 September 2003 for Messrs Lett, Thake and
Harwood (2002: 27.5%) and 13% for Messrs Carter, McLarty, Embley and Newman (2002: 13%). In
addition, directors may elect that the Group pays an amount deducted from their salary into a separate
executive pension scheme of their choice.
Performance
Set out below is a Performance Graph that compares the share price performance of the Group's shares
with the those of the FTSE support services sector, which the directors view as the most appropriate
measure of comparative performance.
Report on
Directors'
Remuneration
For the year ended 
30 September 2003
The total shareholder return (TSR ) for the
5 year period of -52% compares to a total
return provided by the FTSE support sector
index of -24%. Whilst the Company's share
price performed ahead of the sector until early
2001, the impact of trading statements issued
in 2001 and 2002 acted to depress the share
price. The TSR for the 12 month period ended
30th September 2003 of 20% is marginally
ahead of the equivalent sector return of 18%. Aukett Group Plc annual report and accounts 2003 18
Directors service contracts
The Board's policy is to offer service agreements to executive directors with notice periods of not more
than 12 months. All executive directors have rolling service contracts with the Company, which are subject
to 12 months' notice of termination by either party.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts with the Company, but the appointment of each
is recorded in writing.
