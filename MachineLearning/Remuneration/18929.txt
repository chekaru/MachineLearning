Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee ( the Committee') comprises the two non-executive directors and is 
chaired by Mr Deighton. Other than previously disclosed, neither member of the committee has any
personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships
or day-to day involvement in running the business. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
No director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration. In determining the directors'
remuneration for the year, the Committee consulted Mr J L Ripoll (Chairman & CEO) about its proposals.  
The Committee meets as and when appropriate during the year and is responsible for determining all
aspects of the executive directors' remuneration, including share options and the terms and conditions of
their service contracts. 
The fees of the non-executive directors are determined by the executive directors.
Remuneration policy
The policy of the Board is to motivate and retain the best executive directors by rewarding them with
competitive salary and benefit packages linked to achieving the Group's strategic goals. Performance
targets set by the Committee for bonus and incentive schemes are intended to be stretching and reward
superior performance.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors and senior management:
  Basic annual salary that is reviewed annually having regard to individual performance, responsibility and 
skills. Executive directors also receive benefits-in-kind comprising private medical insurance and a car or 
equivalent allowance;
  Performance related annual bonuses, up to a maximum of 75% of the executive directors' salary, that are 
calculated by reference to a combination of Group profit targets and individual performance targets;
  Share option incentives under the Long Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP') and other share option schemes which 
are linked to the long-term performance of the Company and thus align the executives' interests with 
those of the shareholders. The extent to which an award under the LTIP will vest and thus become 
exercisable, is measured by reference to the growth in the Group's earnings per share over the 
performance period; and
  The executive directors are members of defined contribution pension schemes and annual contributions 
are calculated by reference to basic salaries with neither annual bonuses nor awards under the share 
incentive schemes taken into account in calculating the amounts due.
Share Options
A long term share incentive plan ( the Plan') exists for executive directors of the Company and key senior
executives of the Group which involves the award of options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company at
nil cost. The ability to exercise these options will be dependent on the Group's performance over a plan
cycle compared to objective performance targets set by the Committee and agreed with the Board at the
commencement of each plan cycle. It is intended that the performance targets will be demanding.
The actual number of shares to be placed under option to individual participants will depend on a number
of factors, including their level of seniority in the Group. No options are currently in issue under the Plan.

Certain executive directors also have options granted to them under the terms of the 1988 and 1998
Executive Share Option schemes which are open to all employees although, following the introduction of
the LTIP scheme, the executive directors are not eligible to acquire new options. Under that scheme,
options are allocated to qualifying employees by reference to profit for the year and basic salary. The
exercise of options granted under the various schemes are not dependent upon performance criteria. The
exercise price of the options granted under these schemes is equal to the market value of the Company's
shares at the time when the options are granted. No options were granted to or exercised by executive
directors during the year.
Pension arrangements
Certain executive directors are members of the Company's Executive pension scheme, which is a defined
contribution scheme for directors and other senior employees of the Group. In addition, directors may elect
that the Group pays an amount deducted from their salary into a separate executive pension scheme of their
choice. The contribution rate into the scheme was 27.5% of basic salary for the year ended 30 September
2004 for Mr Harwood (2003: 27.5%) and 13% for Messrs Carter, McLarty, Embley and Newman (2003: 13%).
Mr Ripoll and Mr Beckers did not receive any contribution towards their pension during the year. 
Performance
Set out below is a Performance Graph that compares the share price performance of the Group's shares
with the those of the FTSE support services sector, which the directors view as the most appropriate
measure of comparative performance.
Directors service contracts
The Board's policy is to offer service agreements to executive directors with notice periods of not more
than 12 months. With the exception of Mr Ripoll who does not have a service contract, all executive
directors have rolling service contracts with the Company which are subject to 12 months' notice of
termination by either party. 
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts with the Company, but the appointment of each
is recorded in writing in accordance with guidance under the Combined Code.
Report on
Directors'
Remuneration
For the year ended 
30 September 2004
The total shareholder return ( TSR') for the 
5-year period of -79% compares to a total
return provided by the FTSE support service
sector index of -35%. Whilst the Company's
share price performed ahead of the sector until
early 2001, the impact of trading statements
issued in 2001 and 2002 acted to depress the
share price. The TSR for the 12 months period
ended 30 September 2004 of -8% is marginally
behind the equivalent sector return of -4% Aukett Group Plc annual report and accounts 2004 17
