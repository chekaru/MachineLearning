 REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
2002/2003 AUSTIN REED GROUP PLC 10
This report has been prepared by the Remuneration
Committee. It complies with the provisions set out in the
Combined Code issued by the Committee on Corporate
Governance and with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act
1985 (the Act ). In accordance with section 241A of the Act
the Company will be proposing an ordinary resolution to
approve the Report of the Remuneration Committee at the
Annual General Meeting.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee is comprised of all the Non-
Executive Directors of the Company (see page 6 for details)
and is chaired by John Sanders, the Deputy Chairman and
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. Meetings are
held on at least four occasions each year. Roger Jennings
attends at the request of the Committee, when required.
New Bridge Street Consultants, who were appointed by the
Remuneration Committee, have provided remuneration
advice to the Committee throughout the year. In addition,
New Bridge Street Consultants provided advice on the
operation of the Company's share plans during the year.
REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration policy aims to ensure that Executive
Directors are fairly rewarded for their individual contributions
to the Group's performance and that remuneration packages
are competitive with those of comparable public companies.
The elements of remuneration are basic salary, benefits (such
as a company car and private health insurance), pension,
performance related bonus and long-term incentive schemes
designed to align the interests of the Executive Directors with
those of the Group's shareholders.
The Committee believes that all of the separate elements of
remuneration should be looked at as forming one complete
package for Executive Directors. The fixed element of the
remuneration package, i.e., basic salary, benefits and pension
is set at relative median levels. The other variable elements
(annual bonus scheme and long-term incentive plan) have
been designed to provide Executive Directors with the
opportunity to earn further rewards but only in recognition of
superior performance.
SALARIES AND BENEFITS
The Remuneration Committee sets the annual salaries for
Executive Directors, having regard to personal performance
and independently compiled salary survey information.
Base salary levels are kept at levels comparable to the median
salaries of predominantly UK based retailers of a broadly
similar size.
PERFORMANCE RELATED BONUS
An annual bonus can be earned by Executive Directors for 
the achievement of specific financial and qualitative targets
set by the Remuneration Committee and dependent upon
individual performance. 
The Committee sets the level of financial targets at which
bonuses are paid before the commencement of each financial
year. The highest levels of bonus (up to 105% of salaries) are
only paid on the achievement of truly exceptional
performance as determined by the Committee. Up to 85% of
the bonus award relates to the achievement of profit before
tax and return on capital against pre-determined targets with
up to 20% payable against agreed qualitative targets.
CONTRACTS OF SERVICE
Each Executive Director entered into a service contract upon
appointment to the Board, (Roger Jennings on 12 October
1996, Geoff Gibson on 15 July 1996 and David Lowbridge on
3 April 2001). Each such contract now contains a 12 month
notice period, in accordance with the recommendation of the
Combined Code. During such notice period it is the
Company's policy, where possible, to have regard to an
Executive Director's duty to mitigate his loss in respect of
those contractual payments that he would otherwise be
entitled to receive i.e. basic salary, benefits and pensionable
service. Each case is judged on its own merits. No
compensation payments for loss of office were made to
Directors during the year. 
Executive Directors are allowed to accept one external
directorship, subject to prior approval of the Board and are
encouraged to broaden their experience for the mutual
benefit of both parties. Any fee arising from such duties is
usually payable to the Director, subject to the agreement of
the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. 
INCENTIVE SCHEMES
The Company adopted the Austin Reed Group PLC 2000
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) at its Annual
General Meeting in May 2000.
The ESOS is a share option scheme developed in line with
long established market practice. Under the scheme, each
individual participant is subject to a 4 times total
remuneration cap on the value of options granted during a
rolling ten year period. The Remuneration Committee has a
policy of phasing grants to participants under the ESOS so
that holdings of options up to the 4 times total remuneration
limit may only be built up over a number of years.
The vesting of all options is subject to a performance
condition that requires the Company's adjusted earnings per
share (EPS) growth to exceed the growth in the Retail Prices
Index (RPI) plus a further specified percentage per annum
over a period of at least 3 years, measured from a fixed base
point at the grant of the option. The Company's policy is to set
a target EPS growth rate of RPI plus 4% per annum. This is
higher than the minimum target agreed by shareholders at the
time the plan was introduced (RPI plus 3% per annum). REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
11 AUSTIN REED GROUP PLC 2002/2003
This performance condition is viewed as the most appropriate
measure for the Company's ESOS as it requires a significant
improvement in financial performance before options may 
be exercised.
The only options outstanding to the Executive Directors are
those granted under the terms of the 2000 Executive Share
Option Scheme, the performance conditions of which are
detailed above. The shares began the year at 132.5p and at
their peak reached 194p on 24 April 2002. At the year end
the share price was 105p. See page 12 of this report for details
of options granted under the Scheme.
REMUNERATION OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The date of appointment for each Non-Executive Director is
set out on page 6.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for three-year periods
and their continued service thereafter is subject to review by
the Board. 
A Non-Executive Director's appointment may be terminated
on his not being re-elected by shareholders at General
Meeting, in accordance with the Articles of Association. Since
1999 a 6 month notice period must be given by a 
Non-Executive Director or the Company and during such
notice period a Non-Executive Director would be entitled to
fees for that period.
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined
by the Board of Directors with the assistance of independent
advice concerning comparable organisations and
appointments.
Fees are reviewed on an annual basis and were last increased
on 1 January 2002. Such fees are not performance related.
In order to further align the interests of the Non-Executive
Directors with those of the shareholders these Directors have
agreed to purchase ordinary shares in the Group to the value
of at least  3,000 on an annual basis from the fees receivable
from the Company.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts
and do not receive a pension or other significant benefits
from the Group, nor do they participate in any of the bonus,
incentive or share option schemes.
They may be re-elected subject to Board and shareholder
approval and the provisions of the Companies Act.
DIRECTORS' EXPENSES
Procedures are in place for the authorisation and payment of
expenses reimbursed to all Directors. The Audit Committee
reviews a schedule of expenses incurred on an annual basis.
REVIEW OF PAST PERFORMANCE
Below is a five-year performance graph of the Company's
total shareholder return performance against the total
shareholder return of the FTSE All-Share General Retailers
Index for this period.
The Committee considers this to be the most appropriate graph
to compare the Company's performance against because it
includes many of the peer group against which the Company
directly competes and who are included in the same
comparator groups when determining median salary levels.

DIRECTORS' INTERESTS
The Austin Reed Employee Trust (the Trust ) provides a number of the ordinary shares required to fulfil entitlements under 
the current option scheme. As beneficiaries under the Trust, the Executive Directors are deemed to be interested in the shares 
held by the Trust which, at 31 January 2003, amounted to 198,447 ordinary shares. No changes took place in the interests 
of Directors between 31 January 2003 and the date of this report.
In accordance with the Deferred Bonus Award made during 1999/2000, on 1 February 2002 Roger Jennings and 
Geoff Gibson received and sold to the Trust on the same date 41,667 and 20,833 ordinary shares, respectively.
PENSIONS
All Executive Directors are currently members of the Group's defined benefit scheme. Subject to Inland Revenue limits, 
members are eligible for a pension of up to two thirds of salary upon retirement at the age of 60. For current Executive 
Directors effective pension accruals are at the rate of 1/30th of salary on a non-contributory basis.

of the year.
The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer value represents the capital value of the pension payable to the Director.
