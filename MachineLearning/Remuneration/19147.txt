Remuneration Report
Remuneration Report
As an AIM listed Company, the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 do not apply to the Company. The Remuneration 
Committee makes the following report:
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee during the year comprised Michael Stone (Chairman) and John Bell (resigned 28 January 2009). 
Neither had nor has any personal financial interest other than in respect of the fees or salary paid to them. The committee 
determines the overall remuneration policy for Executive Directors and the Divisional Directors, and has delegated responsibility from 
the Board for setting the remuneration packages of individual Executive Directors.
The committee is authorised by the Board to obtain any outside professional advice about remuneration matters but has not found it 
necessary to do so during the year.
James Leek was appointed to the committee with effect from 28 January 2009.
Remuneration Policy
The committee's policy is designed to ensure that the remuneration packages offered are competitive with companies of a 
comparable size and are capable of attracting, retaining and motivating Executives of a suitable calibre. The policy aims to ensure 
that individual short term and long term rewards and incentives are aligned both with the performance of the Group and the interests 
of the shareholders, and also reflect the individual contributions of the Executive concerned. 
Components of Remuneration
Basic Salary
Basic salaries are paid monthly in cash and reviewed annually by the committee in the light of individual performance and 
benchmark comparisons for quoted companies of a similar size. Reflecting the current UK economic difficulties there will be no 
increase over the 2008 level in basic salaries of the two Executive Directors and the Divisional Directors.
Performance Related Bonus
The Group operates a performance related Executive Bonus Scheme for the benefit of the Executive and Divisional Directors. The 
purpose of the scheme is to enable individuals to increase their earnings by meeting or outperforming short term financial objectives 
for the financial year concerned.  Such objectives are set by the committee in the case of the Executive Directors and by the Chief 
Executive in the case of the Divisional Directors under delegated authority from the committee. During the year ending 31 December 
2008 Grahame Rummery received  18,750 and Trevor Clingo  13,125 in respect of the 2007 financial year.
Bonus payments are not eligible for the calculation of pension entitlement.
Share Option Schemes
The Group operates a share option plan for the granting of Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI ) Options and Unapproved 
Options. The plan was established in December 2005. Options were granted in December 2005 in recognition of the performance 
to date of the Executives concerned in bringing the Group to the point at which it could contemplate an Initial Public Offering and 
quotation on the Alternative Investment Market.
In November 2006 a further grant of options was made the exercise of which is conditional on meeting a cumulative net growth in 
earnings per share over the three year trading period to 31 December 2009 (see below). At 31 December 2008 and at the date of 
this Report, Directors held the following options over ordinary shares in the Company:
