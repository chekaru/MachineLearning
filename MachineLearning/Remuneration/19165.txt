Remuneration Report
As an AIM listed Company, the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 do not apply to the Company. The 
Remuneration Committee makes the following report:
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprised of Michael Stone (Chairman) and James Leek (appointed 28 January 2009). 
John Bell resigned on 28 January 2009. None of the aforementioned committee members had or has any personal financial 
interest other than in respect of fees or salary paid to them as disclosed below, and in respect of shares held beneficially, as 
disclosed on page 19 in this Annual Report.
The Committee determines the overall remuneration policy for Executive Directors and Divisional Directors and has delegated 
responsibility from the Board for setting the remuneration packages of the individual Executive Directors.
The Committee is authorised by the Board to obtain any outside professional advice about remuneration matters but has not 
found it necessary to do so during the year.
Remuneration Policy
The committee's policy is designed to ensure that the remuneration packages offered are competitive with companies of a 
comparable size and are capable of attracting, retaining and motivating Executives of a suitable calibre. The policy aims to 
ensure that individual short-term and long-term rewards and incentives are aligned both with the performance of the Group 
and the interests of the Shareholders, and also reflect the individual contributions of the Executive concerned. 
Components of Remuneration
Basic salary
Basic salaries are paid monthly in cash and reviewed annually by the committee in the light of individual performance and 
benchmark comparisons for quoted companies of a similar size. Reflecting the current UK economic difficulties there will be 
no increase in the current year over the 2009 level in the basic salaries of the two Executive Directors.
Performance Related Bonus
The Group operates a performance related Executive Bonus Scheme for the benefit of the Executive and Divisional Directors. 
The purpose of the scheme is to enable individuals to increase their earnings by meeting or outperforming short-term 
financial objectives for the financial year concerned. Such objectives are set by the committee in the case of the Executive 
Directors and by the Chief Executive in the case of the Divisional Directors under delegated authority from the committee. 
During the year ending 31 December 2009 Grahame Rummery received  19,688 and Trevor Clingo  13,800 in respect of 
the 2008 financial year.
Bonus payments are not eligible for the calculation of pension entitlement.
Share Option Schemes
The Group operates a share option plan for the granting of Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI ) Options and 
Unapproved Options. The plan was established in December 2005. Options were granted in December 2005 in recognition 
of the performance to date of the Executives concerned in bringing the Group to the point at which it could contemplate an 
Initial Public Offering and quotation on the Alternative Investment Market.
In November 2006 a further grant of options was made the exercise of which is conditional on meeting a cumulative net 
growth in earnings per share over the three year trading period to 31 December 2009. At 31 December 2009 the minimum 
earnings per share required for the vesting of options was not achieved, therefore these options have lapsed. www.autoclenz.co.uk

* EMI options
No options were exercised or waived during the year.
The minimum vesting conditions were not achieved for 110,000 shares for G Rummery and 56,250 shares for T Clingo, 
these options have therefore lapsed.
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to review annually the case for the granting of further share options to the 
senior management team and to key members of the wider management team. Appropriate announcements of such grants 
are made during the periods permitted by the Aim rules.
Pensions
Grahame Rummery and Trevor Clingo are members of defined contribution pension schemes to which the Group contributes 
10% of their basic salaries.
Benefits in Kind

Trevor Clingo is entitled to an executive car, private medical insurance and life assurance cover of three times annual salary 
with spouses benefit of 25% of annual salary payable up to age 65.
Service Agreements
The service agreements of the Executive Directors provide for 12 months' notice and do not include any requirement for 
compensation to be paid upon termination of employment other than in respect of the appropriate period of notice.
Non-Executive Directors 
James Leek and Michael Stone entered into a Non-Executive Directorship on 28 January 2009 and 1 December 2005 
respectively. The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is set by all of the Directors. James Leek has a salary of 
 15,000 per annum, with first payment due from 1 August 2009. Michael Stone was paid a salary at the rate of  25,000 
per annum for the period to 28 February 2009; he agreed a reduction to  15,000 with effect from 1 March 2009. Mr Leek 
and Mr Stone have both agreed to their fees remaining at this level for the current year in view of the difficult economic 
conditions. John Bell was paid six months' salary in line with his Service Agreement.
Neither Mr Leek nor Mr Stone is eligible for performance related bonuses or awards under long-term incentive plans and no 
pension contributions are made on their behalf. Autoclenz
