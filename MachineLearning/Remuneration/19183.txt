Remuneration Report
As an AIM listed company, the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 do not apply to the Company. The 
Remuneration Committee makes the following report:
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprised of Michael Stone (Chairman) and James Leek. Neither of the aforementioned 
committee members had or has any personal financial interest other than in respect of fees or salary paid to them as 
disclosed below, and in respect of shares held beneficially.
The Committee determines the overall remuneration policy for Executive Directors and Divisional Directors and has 
delegated responsibility from the Board for setting the remuneration packages of the individual Executive Directors.
The Committee is authorized by the Board to obtain any outside professional advice about remuneration matters but has not 
found it necessary to do so during the year.
Remuneration Policy 
The committee's policy is designed to ensure that the remuneration packages offered are competitive with companies of a 
comparable size and are capable of attracting, retaining and motivating executives of a suitable calibre. The policy aims to 
ensure that individual short-term and long-term rewards and incentives are aligned both with the performance of the Group 
and the interests of the Shareholders, and also reflect the individual contributions of the executive concerned. 
Components of Remuneration
Basic salary
Basic salaries are paid monthly in cash and reviewed annually by the committee in the light of individual performance and 
benchmark comparisons for quoted companies of a similar size. A 3% increase to the basic salaries of the two Executive 
Directors has been agreed by the Committee for 2011. This is the first increase in basic salary since 2008.
Performance Related Bonus
The Group operates a performance related Executive Bonus Scheme for the benefit of the executive and Divisional 
Directors. The purpose of the scheme is to enable individuals to increase their earnings by meeting or outperforming 
short-term financial objectives for the financial year concerned. Such objectives are set by the committee in the case of 
the executive Directors and by the Chief Executive in the case of the Divisional Directors under delegated authority from 
the committee. During the year ending 31 December 2010 Grahame Rummery received  64,313 and Trevor Clingo  45,080. 
These amounts were based on performance in 2009 and provided for in the accounts of that year.
Bonus payments are not eligible for the calculation of pension entitlement.
Share Option Schemes
The Group operates a share option plan for the granting of Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI ) Options and 
Unapproved Options. The plan was established in December 2005. Options were granted in December 2005 in recognition 
of the performance to date of the executives concerned in bringing the Group to the point at which it could contemplate an 
Initial Public Offering and quotation on the Alternative Investment Market.

Remuneration Report continued
No options were exercised or waived during the year.
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to review annually the case for the granting of further share options to the 
senior management team and to key members of the wider management team. Appropriate announcements of such grants 
are made during the periods permitted by the Aim rules.
Pensions
Grahame Rummery and Trevor Clingo are members of defined contribution pension schemes to which the Group 
contributes 10% of their basic salaries.
In addition to this they elected to take part in a salary sacrifice scheme to increase the pension contributions to their 
respective pension schemes. This was at no additional cost to Autoclenz and was the same scheme that has been offered 
and taken up by other members of the Autoclenz Group Personal Pension Plan.
Benefits in Kind
Grahame Rummery is entitled to an executive car, private medical insurance and life assurance cover of eight times annual 
salary.
Trevor Clingo is entitled to an executive car, private medical insurance and life assurance cover of eight times annual salary.
Service Agreements
The service agreements of the executive Directors provide for 12 months' notice and do not include any requirement for 
compensation to be paid upon termination of employment other than in respect of the appropriate period of notice.
Non Executive Directors 
James Leek and Michael Stone entered into a Non-Executive Directorship on 28 January 2009 and 1 December 2005 
respectively. The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is set by all of the Directors.
Neither Mr Leek nor Mr Stone are eligible for performance related bonuses or awards under long-term incentive plans and 
no pension contributions are made on their behalf.
Directors' Remuneration 
Remuneration of the Directors in the year to 31 December 2010 was as follows:
