 Introduction
In compliance with recent legislation, a resolution is being put to the forthcoming AGM to approve the Report of the Remuneration
Committee of the Company.
The sections of this Report marked with  *' represent auditable information.
Composition of the Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee (the  Committee') are Mr R Heath, Mr J Alexander, Mr R Bellande, Mr C French and
Mr J Hodges. The Committee is chaired by Mr R Heath and meets not less than twice a year. 
Policy on Remuneration of Executive Directors and senior executives
The remuneration packages (including share-based benefits and contract periods) for Executive Directors and senior executives are
determined by the Committee. It ensures that each remuneration package is appropriate for the responsibilities of the individual,
taking into consideration the overall financial and business position of the Group and the importance of recruiting, motivating and
retaining management of the appropriate calibre.
Base salary and benefits
The base salary and benefits of Executive Directors and senior executives are reviewed annually by the Committee, having regard to the
practice of comparable companies supported, where appropriate, by external independent surveys and external remuneration consultants. 
During the year, PricewaterhouseCoopers provided advice to the Remuneration Committee in relation to senior executive
remuneration matters.
Executive bonus scheme
The Executive Directors participate in an annual bonus scheme. This scheme measures performance against a target based on criteria
established by the Committee and could result in cash payments of up to a maximum of 30% of salary if the operating profit target
of the Group is significantly exceeded. The criteria for bonus payments are primarily related to the profitability of the Group. 
Share options
The Company believes that share ownership by the employees strengthens the link between the individual's personal interest and
that of the shareholders. 
The Company operates four share option schemes, an Inland Revenue approved Savings-Related Share Option ( SAYE') Scheme, an
approved Executive Share Option Scheme, an unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme and a Long Term Share Incentive Plan ( LTIP'). 
The Company introduced the SAYE Scheme in 1998 to provide a savings and investment opportunity for its UK employees. Awards
under the SAYE Scheme may normally be exercised after three, five or seven years, at the market value of an ordinary share at the
time of grant. A total of 313,805 options were granted to employees under the SAYE Scheme in May 2002. 
The two Executive Share Option Schemes are reserved for senior executives. In respect of these schemes, it is the Group's policy to
issue share options, after a suitable qualifying period, to ensure that senior executives have an appropriate equity interest in the Group. 
All Executive Share Options are exercisable only on meeting performance targets. The performance targets are set and assessed 
by the Committee. 
The number of options granted under the Executive Share Option Schemes is determined by the Committee having regard to the
executive's salary, length of service and functional responsibility. A total of 271,000 options were granted to senior executives under
the Executive Share Option Schemes in September 2002.  
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in all of the schemes. However, the policy of the Committee is not to make awards of
options under the Executive Share Option Schemes to Executive Directors who receive awards under the LTIP. No Executive Directors
have been granted options under the Executive Share Option Schemes during the year. 
Long Term Share Incentive Plan*
The LTIP was introduced in 2002, following approval at the last AGM, to encourage continuing improvement in the Group's
performance over the longer term. Any employee of the Group (including Executive Directors) may, on recommendation by the
Committee, participate in the LTIP.
Any shares arising on vesting of awards under the LTIP will be held in an Employee Benefit Trust ( EBT') and may be transferred to
the participants in the LTIP at the discretion of the Trustees, subject to certain performance criteria being met.
No exercise price is payable on shares transferred pursuant to the LTIP. Under normal circumstances, the shares may vest no earlier
than three years from the date of award.
Report of the Remuneration Committee
16 AutoLogic Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2002 The maximum award that can be made under the LTIP is up to one and a half times an employee's annual remuneration. Awards will
normally vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant of the awards. Awards will not normally vest unless over the three year period
from the date of grant there has been a significant and sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group.
The number of shares which may vest under the LTIP is based on the extent to which the performance targets attached to each
award under the LTIP have been met. In the case of the awards made under the LTIP in 2002, full vesting is not expected to occur
unless there has been growth in earnings per share of the Company over the three year performance period of 51%. This target
was set by reference to the prevailing market forecast earnings per share growth over the performance period in question.
The Trustees of the EBT may amend the LTIP at any time, to benefit the administration of the LTIP or to take account of a change 
in legislation and to obtain or maintain favourable taxation, exchange control or regulatory treatment of the Company, any of its
subsidiaries or any participant.
A total of 210,230 options were granted to Executive Directors and senior executives under the LTIP in September 2002. 
The Executive Directors' interests in LTIP awards are as follows:

Performance graph
The Company's total shareholder return performance, for the five years to 31 December 2002 is shown on the graph below
compared with the average performance achieved by all FTSE Small-Cap companies. 
In the opinion of the Directors, the FTSE Small-Cap Price Index is the most appropriate index against which the total shareholder
return of the Company should be measured because it is an index of similar sized companies to the Company.

Directors' pensions*
The Executive Directors are entitled to join the Group money purchase pension scheme. Mr J Merry and Mr P Nuttall are members
of this scheme.

occupational pension scheme with a normal retirement age of 60 years. The Executive Directors are entitled to join this Plan. 
Mr G Guinchard and Mr P Nuttall are members of this Plan.
The Group's policy is to include annual bonuses within the pensionable remuneration. This policy, whilst at variance with the
recommendations of the Combined Code, is considered appropriate having regard to the overall mix and balance of the total
remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior executives.
