 Introduction
As required by the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the  Regulations'), this Report will be subject to an advisory
shareholder vote at the AGM. The Report is intended to be in full compliance with the requirements of the Regulations. 
The sections of this Report marked with    ' represent auditable information.
Composition of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the  Committee') is comprised solely of independent Non-Executive Directors. The members of the
Committee are John Alexander, Roland Bellande, Chris French and John Hodges. The Committee was previously chaired by Reg
Heath until he retired as a Director of the Company on 9 May 2003 and is now chaired by Chris French. 
During the year, KPMG LLP provided advice to the Committee in relation to senior executive remuneration matters.
Policy on Remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Executives
The remuneration packages (including share-based benefits and contractual notice periods) for Executive Directors and senior
executives are determined by the Committee. It ensures that each remuneration package is appropriate for the responsibilities of
the individual, taking into consideration the overall financial and business position of the Group and the importance of recruiting,
motivating and retaining management of the appropriate calibre.
The following summarises the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors:
Base salary and benefits
The base salary and benefits of Executive Directors and other senior executives are reviewed annually by the Committee. When
determining base salaries, the Committee takes into account the individual's experience, contribution and performance while having
regard to the practice of comparable companies supported, where appropriate, by external independent surveys and external
remuneration consultants. 
The base salary of Gilles Guinchard was increased in May 2003 to  300,000 per annum following his appointment as Chief
Executive of the Group. The base salaries of the other Executive Directors were not changed during the year.
Executive bonus scheme
The Executive Directors participate in the Company's Senior Management Bonus Scheme (the  Scheme').
The Scheme measures performance against a demanding target based on criteria established by the Committee and could have
resulted in cash payments of up to 100% of base salary if the actual profit of the Group for the year had exceeded budget by
30%. The Scheme also provided for 50% of any bonus above 20% to be reinvested in shares in the Company and held for a
minimum period of 3 years.
No bonuses were paid or will be paid to the Executive Directors under the Scheme in respect of the year ended 31 December 2003.
Share options
The Company believes that share ownership by its employees strengthens the link between the individual's personal interest and that
of shareholders in the Company. The Company's share option schemes encourage employee share ownership across the Group.
The Company operates four share option schemes; an Inland Revenue approved Savings Related Share Option Scheme (the  SAYE
Scheme'), an Inland Revenue approved Executive Share Option Scheme, an unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme and a Long
Term Share Incentive Plan (the  LTIP').
The Company introduced the SAYE Scheme in 1998 to provide a savings and investment opportunity for its UK employees. Awards
under the SAYE Scheme may normally be exercised after three, five or seven years, at the market value of an ordinary share at the
time of award.
The two Executive Share Option Schemes are reserved for senior executives. In respect of these schemes, it is the Group's policy to award
share options, after a suitable qualifying period, to ensure that senior executives have an appropriate equity interest in the Company.
All executive share options are exercisable only on meeting pre-determined performance targets. The Committee sets the
performance targets when the options are awarded and assesses the achievement of the performance targets at the end of the
applicable three-year performance period.
The number of options awarded under the Executive Share Option Schemes is determined by the Committee having regard to the
executive's salary, length of service and functional responsibility.
Report of the Remuneration Committee
16 AutoLogic Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Options over a total of 379,000 shares in the Company were awarded to senior executives under the Executive Share Option
Schemes in 2003. The price at which such options may be exercised is the average middle market price over the five working days
preceding the date of award.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in all of the Company's share schemes. However, the policy of the Committee is not to
make awards of options under the Executive Share Option Schemes to Executive Directors who receive awards under the LTIP. No
Executive Directors have been awarded options under the Executive Share Option Schemes during the year.
  Long Term Share Incentive Plan
The LTIP was introduced in 2002, following approval at the AGM held in May 2002. The LTIP is designed to motivate its participants
to improve the Group's performance over the longer term.
The LTIP is operated through an Employee Benefit Trust managed by independent trustees (the  Trustees'). Awards are made at the
discretion of the Trustees having regard to the recommendation of the Committee. Shares required to satisfy awards which vest are
transferred by the Trustees to the relevant participants.
Vesting of awards under the LTIP is subject to satisfaction of challenging performance conditions set by the Committee.
No exercise price is payable in respect of shares vesting pursuant to the LTIP .
Under normal circumstances, the shares may vest no earlier than three years from the date of award. If circumstances arise where
vesting is to occur prior to the end of any applicable vesting period, this would normally be on a pro rata basis although the
Trustees retain an overriding discretion in appropriate circumstances.
Awards under the LTIP will, if the performance conditions have been satisfied, normally vest on the third anniversary of the date of
award. Awards will not normally vest unless over the three-year period from the date of award, there has been a significant and
sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group. The number of shares which may vest under the LTIP
is based on the extent to which the performance target attached to a particular award under the LTIP has been met.
In the case of the awards made under the LTIP in respect of 2002, the performance condition for full vesting is growth in earnings
per share of the Company over the three-year performance period of not less than 51%.
In the case of awards made under the LTIP in respect of 2003, the performance condition for full vesting is growth in earnings per
share of the Company over the three year performance period of not less than RPI + 3% per annum (for 50% vesting) and RPI +
6% per annum (for 100% vesting).
A total of 378,802 options were granted under the LTIP in respect of the year ended 31 December 2003. The following table sets
out the interests of the Executive Directors in awards under the LTIP.

The awards made in respect of the year ended 31 December 2003 were planned to be made in April 2003 but, for legal reasons,
could not be made until January 2004. The terms on which the awards were made were such as to ensure that the participants were
neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by the delay in the making of the awards.

* The fees of John Alexander, Chris French and John Hodges include extraordinary fees (based on a daily rate agreed with the
Board) in respect of the significant additional duties and responsibilities required of them during the bid approach in September
2003. The basic fee for each of the Non-Executive Directors during 2003 was  25,000 per annum. Chris French was provided
with a company car in lieu of an increase in his director's fee on his assumption of the position of Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director in May 2003.
** This bonus was committed at the time of Gilles Guinchard's appointment.
  Directors' pensions
The Executive Directors are entitled to join the money purchase Group pension scheme. Philip Nuttall and John Merry are members
of the scheme. 
In April 2002, the AutoLogic Holdings plc Senior Executive Pension Plan (the  Plan') was established. This Plan is a money purchase
occupational pension scheme with a normal retirement age of 60 years. The Executive Directors are entitled to join this Plan. Gilles
Guinchard and Philip Nuttall are members of this Plan.
John Merry is a member of the AutoLogic Holdings plc Group defined benefit scheme, to which contributions ceased to be paid 
in April 1992.
The Group's policy has, in the past, been to include annual bonuses within the pensionable remuneration. This policy, whilst at
variance with the recommendations of the Combined Code, is considered appropriate having regard to the overall mix and balance
of the total remuneration packages.
