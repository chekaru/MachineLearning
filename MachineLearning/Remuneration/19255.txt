 (1) Introduction
As required by The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, (the Regulations ), this Report has been approved by
the Board and will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the AGM. The Report is intended to be in full compliance with
the requirements of the Regulations.
The sections marked with    ' represent auditable information.
(2) Composition of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee ) is chaired by Chris French and comprises all of the Non-Executive Directors.
The members of the Committee and their attendance at meetings during the year are shown on page 15. The Committee is
responsible for determining the remuneration packages and conditions of employment (including share-based benefits and
contractual notice periods) of the Executive Directors, the Chairman and the Company Secretary, as well as reviewing the
salaries of senior executives.
During the year, KPMG LLP (KPMG ) provided advice to the Committee in relation to senior executive remuneration matters.
KPMG has no other connection with the Group other than in the provision of advice on executive and employee remuneration. 
(3) Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors
The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are set by the Board and are reviewed at least every three years. The review takes
account of fees paid for similar positions in the market, together with any additional responsibilities undertaken by the Director,
such as acting as Chairman to one of the Board Committees. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to receive pension
entitlements or bonuses and may not participate in share option schemes. The Non-Executive Directors and their respective
annual fees for 2004 are shown on page 13.
(4) Policy on Remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Executives
The objective of the Committee's remuneration policy is to ensure that members of the executive management of the Group
are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner,
rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Group. Each remuneration package is deemed appropriate for
the responsibilities of the individual, taking into consideration the overall financial and business position of the Group and the
importance of recruiting, motivating and retaining management of the appropriate calibre. The policy is aligned with the
recommendation of the Combined Code on Directors' Remuneration and will be kept under review in subsequent years to
ensure that it reflects changing circumstances.
The following summarises the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors:
(i) Base Salary and Benefits
The base salary and benefits of Executive Directors and other senior executives are reviewed annually by the Committee. When
determining base salaries, the Committee takes into account the individual experience, contribution and performance while
having regard to the practice of comparable companies supported, where appropriate, by external independent surveys and
external remuneration consultants. The base salaries of the Executive Directors did not change during the year.
(ii) Executive Bonus Scheme
The Executive Directors participate in the AutoLogic's Senior Management Bonus Scheme (the Scheme ).
The Scheme measures performance against a demanding target based on criteria established by the Committee. For 2004, the
Scheme provided for a combination of cashflow and profit targets and could have resulted in cash payments of up to 100% of
base salary if both (i) the actual profit of the Group for the year had exceeded budget by 30% and (ii) the Group cashflow
target had been achieved.
No bonuses have been paid to the Executive Directors under the Scheme in respect of the year ended 31 December 2004.
(5) Share Incentives
The Company operates four share incentive schemes; an Inland Revenue approved Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (the
SAYE Scheme ), an Inland Revenue approved Executive Share Option Scheme, an unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme
and a Long Term Incentive Plan (the LTIP ).
The Company introduced the SAYE Scheme in 1998 to provide a savings and investment opportunity for its UK employees.
Awards under the SAYE Scheme may normally be exercised after three, five or seven years, at the market value of an ordinary
share at the time of award. All current awards under the SAYE Scheme will have matured by the end of 2005. 
The two Executive Share Option Schemes are reserved for senior executives. In respect of these schemes, it has been the Group's
policy to award share options, after a suitable qualifying period, to senior executives on a phased basis over a number of years.
10 AutoLogic Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2004
Directors' Remuneration Report AutoLogic Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2004 11
All executive share options are exercisable only on meeting pre-determined performance targets. The Committee sets the
performance targets when the options are awarded and assesses the achievement of the performance targets throughout and at
the end of the applicable three-year performance period. This resulted in the lapse of 863,000 options under the Executive Share
Options Schemes following the 2004 year end as a result of the applicable performance conditions not having been achieved.
The number of options awarded under the Executive Share Option Schemes is determined by the Committee having regard to the
executive's salary, length of service and functional responsibility.
Options over a total of 543,000 shares in the Company were awarded to senior executives under the Executive Share Option
Schemes in 2004. The price at which such options may be exercised is the average middle market price over the five working days
preceding the date of award.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in all of the Company's share schemes. However, the policy of the Committee is not to
make awards of options under the Executive Share Option Schemes to Executive Directors who receive awards under the LTIP. No
Executive Directors who held office during the year have been awarded options under the Executive Share Option Schemes in 2004.
While the Company believes that share ownership by its employees is desirable, it also recognises that share options may not
provide a suitable incentive in the current environment. At the present time, the Committee does not anticipate making further
awards under either of the Company's Executive Share Option Schemes or under its SAYE Scheme.
(6) Long Term Incentive Plan
The LTIP was introduced in 2002, following approval at the AGM held in May 2002. The LTIP is designed to motivate its participants
to improve the Group's performance over the longer term.
The LTIP is operated though an Employee Benefit Trust managed by independent trustees (the Trustees ). Awards are made at the
discretion of the Trustees having regard to the recommendation of the Committee. Shares required to satisfy awards which vest are
transferred by the Trustees to the relevant participants.
Vesting of awards under the LTIP is subject to satisfaction of challenging performance conditions set by the Committee.
No exercise price is payable in respect of shares vesting pursuant to the LTIP.
Awards under the LTIP will, if the performance conditions have been satisfied, normally vest on the third anniversary of the date of
award. Awards will not normally vest unless, over the relevant three-year performance period, there has been a significant and
sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group. The number of shares which may vest under the LTIP
is based on the extent to which the performance target attached to a particular award under the LTIP has been met.
In the case of the awards made under the LTIP in respect of 2002, the performance condition for full vesting was growth in
earnings per share of the Group over the three-year performance period of not less than 51%. The performance condition in
respect of these awards was not met and these awards (in respect of a total of 210,230 shares) have therefore lapsed, with effect
from 1 January 2005.
In the case of awards made under the LTIP in respect of 2003 and 2004, the performance condition for vesting is average annual
growth in earnings per share of the Group over the respective three-year performance periods of not less than RPI + 6% (for 100%
vesting) and RPI + 3% (for 50% vesting). 
The Committee believes that using growth in earnings per share as the performance measure for the LTIP scheme provides a
transparent and accessible method of gauging the performance of the Group. The Group calculates performance against these
performance measures by reference to the earnings per share figure appearing in the Group's Financial Statements, which the
Group believes to be the most transparent and objective measure of the Group's financial performance. However, the Committee
recognises that many shareholders now strongly prefer the use of performance measures by reference to the Total Shareholder
Return (TSR ) of the Group relative to an appropriate benchmark comparator group or index. The Committee therefore intends to
recommend the use of TSR as the performance measure for any future LTIP awards.
  A total of 271,595 options were granted under the LTIP in respect of the year ended 31 December 2004. 
The following table sets out the interests of the Executive Directors in awards under the LTIP as at 31 December 2004.

#LTIP awards are calculated using the market value on the date the Committee approves the award. The market value at date of award may differ from the
market value on the date of the Committee approval due to share price movement between the two dates.   
1 The Committee resolved that the awards made under the LTIP in respect of 2002 lapsed with effect from 1st January 2005 due to the performance condition
not having been satisfied.
2 The awards in respect of the year ended 31 December 2003 were planned to be made in April 2003 but, for legal reasons, could not be made until January
2004. The terms on which the awards were made were such as to ensure that the participants were neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by the delay in
the making of the awards.  
(7) External Appointments of Executive Directors 
It is recognised that by holding the office of a Non-Executive Director of another company, an Executive Director may gain valuable
knowledge and experience that can benefit the Group. All external directorships require prior Board approval. 
Philip Nuttall was appointed a Non-Executive Director of William Sinclair Holdings plc on 15 February 2005 and is entitled to retain
any fees earned in relation to this appointment. 
(8) Performance Graph
The Company's total shareholder return performance, for the five years ended 31 December 2004 is shown on the graph below
compared to the average performance achieved by companies within the FTSE Small Cap index.
In the opinion of the Directors, the FTSE Small Cap Index is the most appropriate index against which the total shareholder return
of the Company should be measured because it is an index of similar sized companies to the Company.
The middle market price of an ordinary share in the Company on 31 December 2004 was 260.0p. The middle market price of an
ordinary share in the Company during the year ranged from 227.5p to 372.5p.
