Directors' Remuneration Report
12
(1) Introduction
As required by The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, (the Regulations ), this Report has been approved by the Board 
and will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the AGM. The Report is intended to be in full compliance with the requirements of 
the Regulations.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have audited sections 5, 6, 9 and 10 as required by the Regulations.
(2) Composition of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee ) is chaired by Chris French and comprises all of the Non-Executive Directors. The members
of the Committee and their attendance at meetings for the year are shown on page 17. The Committee is responsible for determining the
remuneration packages and conditions of employment (including share-based benefits and contractual notice periods) of the Executive
Directors, the Chairman and the Company Secretary, as well as reviewing the salaries of senior executives.
(3) Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors
The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are set by the Board and are reviewed at least every three years. The review takes account of fees
paid for similar positions in the market, together with any additional responsibilities undertaken by the Director, such as acting as Chairman to
one of the Board Committees. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to receive pension entitlements or bonuses and may not participate in
share option schemes. The Non-Executive Directors and their respective annual fees for 2005 are shown in full on page 15.
(4) Policy on Remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Executives
The objective of the Committee's remuneration policy is to ensure that members of the executive management of the Company are provided
with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual
contributions to the success of the Group. Each remuneration package is deemed appropriate for the responsibilities of the individual, taking
into consideration the overall financial and business position of the Group and the importance of recruiting, motivating and retaining
management of the appropriate calibre. The policy is aligned with the recommendation of the Combined Code on Directors' Remuneration
and will be kept under review in subsequent years to ensure that it reflects changing circumstances.
The following summarises the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors:
(i) Base salary and benefits
The base salary and benefits of Executive Directors and other senior executives are reviewed annually by the Committee. When determining
base salaries, the Committee takes into account the individual experience, contribution and performance while having regard to the practice
of comparable companies supported, where appropriate, by external independent surveys and external remuneration consultants. 
(ii) Executive bonus scheme
The Executive Directors participate in the Company's Senior Management Bonus Scheme (the Scheme ).
The Scheme measures performance against a demanding target based on criteria established by the Committee. For 2005, the Scheme
provided for a combination of cashflow and profit targets and could have resulted in cash payments of up to 100% of base salary if both 
(i) the actual profit of the Group for the year had exceeded budget by 30% and (ii) the Group cashflow target had been achieved.
No bonuses have been, or will be, paid to the Executive Directors under the Scheme in respect of the year ended 31 December 2005.
(5) Share Incentives
The Company operates four share incentive schemes; an Inland Revenue approved Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (the SAYE
Scheme ), an Inland Revenue approved Executive Share Option Scheme, an unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme and a Long Term
Incentive Plan (the LTIP ).
The Company introduced the SAYE Scheme in 1998 to provide a savings and investment opportunity for its UK employees. Awards under
the SAYE Scheme may normally be exercised at the market value of an ordinary share at the time of award. 
Tim Barber and Russell Brown held options under the SAYE scheme during the financial year. The options are listed in the table below.

Russell Brown 1,789 - - 1,789 - 01/07/05 - 31/12/05 531.00p 13 AutoLogic Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts 2005
All existing awards under the SAYE Scheme matured during the financial year. All outstanding awards lapsed on 1 January 2006. 
The two Executive Share Option Schemes are reserved for senior executives. In respect of these schemes, it has been the Group's policy to
award share options, after a suitable qualifying period, to senior executives on a phased basis over a number of years.
The number of options awarded under the Executive Share Option Schemes is determined by the Committee having regard to the executive's
salary, length of service and functional responsibility. No options were awarded to senior executives under the Executive Share Option
Schemes in 2005. 
All executive share options are exercisable only on meeting pre-determined performance targets. The Committee sets the performance targets
when the options are awarded and assesses the achievement of the performance targets throughout and at the end of the applicable 3-year
performance period. This resulted in the lapse of 245,000 options under the Executive Share Options Schemes following the 2005 year end as
a result of the applicable performance conditions not having been achieved.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in all of the Company's share schemes. However, the policy of the Committee is not to make
awards of options under the Executive Share Option Schemes to Executive Directors who receive awards under the LTIP. No Executive
Directors have been awarded options under the Executive Share Option Schemes during the year.
Tim Barber and Russell Brown held options, awarded prior to their appointment as Executive Directors, under this scheme during the financial
year. The options are listed in the table below. 
At At
1 January 31 December
2005 Granted Exercised Lapsed 2005 Exercise period Exercise price
Tim Barber 30,000 - - 30,000 - 27/04/07 - 26/04/14 330.00p
Russell Brown 25,000 - - - 25,000 27/04/07 - 26/04/14 330.00p
While the Company believes that share ownership by its employees is desirable, it also recognises that share options may not provide a
suitable incentive in the current environment. At the present time, the Committee does not anticipate making further awards under either of 
the Company's Executive Share Option Schemes or under its SAYE Scheme.
(6) Long Term Incentive Plan
The LTIP was introduced in 2002, following approval at the AGM held in May 2002. The LTIP is designed to motivate its participants to
improve the Group's performance over the longer term.
The LTIP is operated through an Employee Benefit Trust managed by independent trustees (the Trustees ). Awards are made at the discretion
of the Trustees having regard to the recommendation of the Committee. Shares required to satisfy awards which vest are transferred by the
Trustees to the relevant participants.
Vesting of awards under the LTIP is subject to satisfaction of challenging performance conditions set by the Committee.
No exercise price is payable in respect of shares vesting pursuant to the LTIP.
Awards under the LTIP will, if the performance conditions have been satisfied, normally vest on the third anniversary of the date of award.
Awards will not normally vest unless performance conditions have been satisfied over the relevant performance period (typically three years), 
or there has been a significant and sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group. The number of shares which
may vest under the LTIP is based on the extent to which the performance target attached to a particular award under the LTIP has been met.
In relation to LTIP awards prior to 2005, the Group's growth in earnings per share was used as the performance measure for LTIP awards. 
In 2005, the Committee recognised that many shareholders strongly preferred the use of performance measures by reference to the total
shareholder return (TSR ) of the Company relative to an appropriate benchmark comparator group or index. The Committee therefore
introduced a TSR based performance condition for all LTIP awards in 2005 and propose to use the same performance conditions for any
awards in 2006. However, the Committee reserves the right to set performance conditions for LTIP awards by reference to different targets,
should it consider this to be appropriate in the circumstances.
In the case of awards made under the LTIP in respect of 2003 and 2004, the performance condition for vesting is average annual growth in
earnings per share of the Group over the respective three-year performance periods of not less than RPI + 6% (for 100% vesting) and RPI +
3% (for 50% vesting). 
In the case of awards made under the LTIP in respect of 2005, the performance condition for vesting is Median TSR (for 35% vesting) over 
the respective three-year performance period, and Median TSR + 5% (for 100% vesting) on a straight line basis. For this purpose, TSR is
measured against the FTSE Small Cap Index. AutoLogic Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts 2005

  Gilles Guinchard resigned as a Director of the Company with effect from 23 January 2006, and as an employee of the Company with effect from 28 February 2006.
Accordingly, all awards to him under the LTIP lapsed with effect from 28 February 2006.
# LTIP awards are calculated using the market value on the date the Committee agrees to recommend the grant to the Trustees. The market value at date of award, 
may differ from the original figure due to share price movement. 
1 The Committee resolved that the awards made under the LTIP in respect of 2002 lapsed with effect from 26 January 2005 due to the performance condition not having
been satisfied.
2 The awards in respect of the year ended 31 December 2003 were planned to be made in April 2003 but, for legal reasons, could not be made until January 2004. 
The terms on which the awards were made were such as to ensure that the participants were neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by the delay in the making of the awards. 
(7) External Appointments of Executive Directors
It is recognised that by holding the office of a Non-Executive Director of another company, an Executive Director may gain valuable knowledge
and experience that can benefit the Group. All external directorships require prior Board approval. 
Philip Nuttall currently holds one external directorship with William Sinclair Holdings plc and is entitled to retain the fees earned connected therewith.
(8) Performance Graph
The Company's total shareholder return performance, for the five years to 31 December 2005 is shown on the graph below compared to the
average performance achieved by companies within the FTSE Small Cap index.
In the opinion of the Directors, the FTSE Small Cap Index is the most appropriate index against which the total shareholder return of the
Company should be measured because it is an index of similar sized companies.
The middle market price of an ordinary share in the Company on 31 December 2005 was 99.5p. The middle market price of an ordinary share 
in the Company during the year ranged from 93.0p to 317.5p.
