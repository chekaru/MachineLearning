Directors' Remuneration Report
(1) Introduction
Notwithstanding the move of the Company to AIM in September 2006, this Report has been approved by the Board and will be subject to an
advisory shareholder vote at the AGM substantially as if the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, (the Regulations ) continued to
apply in full to the Company. The Report is intended to be in full compliance with the requirements of the Regulations.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have audited sections 5, 6, 9 and 10 as required by the Regulations.
(2) Composition of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee ) is chaired by Chris French and also comprises Neil Johnson and John Hodges. The members
of the Committee and their attendance at meetings for the year are shown on pages 18 and 19. The Committee is responsible for determining
the remuneration packages and conditions of employment (including share-based benefits and contractual notice periods) of the Executive
Directors, the Chairman and the Company Secretary, as well as reviewing the salaries of senior executives.
(3) Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors
The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are set by the Board and are reviewed at least every three years. The review takes account of fees
paid for similar positions in the market, together with any additional responsibilities undertaken by the Director, such as acting as Chairman to
one of the Board Committees. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to receive pension entitlements or bonuses and may not participate in
share option schemes. The Non-Executive Directors and their respective annual fees for 2006 are shown in full on page 16.
(4) Policy on Remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Executives
The objective of the Committee's remuneration policy is to ensure that members of the executive management of the Group are provided with
appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual
contributions to the success of the Group. Each remuneration package is deemed appropriate for the responsibilities of the individual, taking
into consideration the overall financial and business position of the Group and the importance of recruiting, motivating and retaining
management of the appropriate calibre. The policy is aligned with the recommendation of the Combined Code on Directors' Remuneration and
will be kept under review in subsequent years to ensure that it reflects changing circumstances.
The following summarises the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors:
(i) Base salary and benefits
The base salary and benefits of Executive Directors and other senior executives are reviewed annually by the Committee. When determining
base salaries, the Committee takes into account the individual experience, contribution and performance while having regard to the practice of
comparable companies supported, where appropriate, by external independent surveys and external remuneration consultants.
(ii) Executive bonus scheme
The Executive Directors participate in the Company's Senior Management Bonus Scheme (the Scheme ).
The Scheme measures performance against a demanding target based on criteria established by the Committee. For 2006, the Scheme
provided for a combination of cashflow and profit targets and could have resulted in cash payments of up to 100% of base salary if both (i) the
profit of the Group for the year had exceeded budget by 53% and (ii) the Group cash flow target had been achieved.
No bonuses have, or will be, paid to the Executive Directors under the Scheme in respect of the year ended 31 December 2006. Discretionary
bonuses were awarded to Russell Brown ( 150,000) and Philip Nuttall ( 30,000) in recognition of their efforts in completing major transactions
during the year.
(iii) Share incentives and LTIPs
The Executive Directors participate in appropriate share incentive schemes and LTIPs which are explained below.
(5) Share Incentives
The Company operates three share incentive schemes; an Inland Revenue approved Executive Share Option Scheme, an unapproved
Executive Share Option Scheme and a Long Term Incentive Plan (the LTIP ).
The two Executive Share Option Schemes are reserved for senior executives. In respect of these schemes, it has been the Group's policy to
award share options, after a suitable qualifying period, to senior executives on a phased basis over a number of years.
The number of options awarded under the Executive Share Option Schemes is determined by the Committee having regard to the executive's
salary, length of service and functional responsibility. No options were awarded to senior executives under the Executive Share Option
Schemes during 2006.
All executive share options are exercisable only on meeting pre-determined performance targets. The Committee sets the performance targets
when the options are awarded and assesses the achievement of the performance targets throughout and at the end of the applicable 3-year
performance period.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in all of the Company's share schemes. However, the policy of the Committee is not to make
awards of options under the Executive Share Option Schemes to Executive Directors who receive awards under the LTIP . No Executive
Directors have been awarded options under the Executive Share Option Schemes during the year. Russell Brown held options over 25,000
shares, awarded prior to his appointment as Executive Director, which lapsed on 6 February 2006.
As reported in the Placing circular to shareholders dated 31 January 2007, the Company proposes to introduce a new share option scheme for
a limited number of senior management following consultation with its major institutional shareholders. Participants in the new share option
scheme are unlikely to receive further awards under either of the existing Executive Share Options Schemes or the LTIP for the foreseeable future. Directors' Remuneration Report

(6) Long Term Incentive Plan
The LTIP was introduced in 2002, following approval at the AGM held in May 2002. The LTIP is designed to motivate its participants to improve
the Group's performance over the longer term.
The LTIP is operated through an Employee Benefit Trust managed by independent trustees (the Trustees ). Awards are made at the discretion
of the Trustees having regard to the recommendation of the Committee. Shares required to satisfy awards which vest are transferred by the
Trustees to the relevant participants.
Vesting of awards under the LTIP is subject to satisfaction of challenging performance conditions set by the Committee.
No exercise price is payable in respect of shares vesting pursuant to the LTIP .
Awards under the LTIP will, if the performance conditions have been satisfied, normally vest on the third anniversary of the date of award.
Awards will not normally vest unless performance conditions have been satisfied over the relevant performance period (typically three years), or
there has been a significant and sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group. The number of shares which may
vest under the LTIP is based on the extent to which the performance target attached to a particular award under the LTIP has been met.
In relation to annual LTIP awards prior to 2005, the Group's growth in earnings per share was used as the performance measure for annual
LTIP awards. In 2005, the Committee recognised that many shareholders preferred the use of performance measures by reference to the total
shareholder return (TSR ) of the Company relative to an appropriate benchmark comparator group or index. The Committee therefore
introduced a TSR based performance condition for all annual LTIP awards in 2005 and 2006. However, the Committee reserves the right to set
performance conditions for LTIP awards by reference to different targets, should it consider this to be appropriate in the circumstances.
In the case of awards made under the LTIP in respect of 2003 and 2004, the performance condition for vesting is average annual growth in earnings
per share of the Group over the respective three-year performance periods of not less than RPI + 6% (for 100% vesting) and RPI + 3% (for 50%
vesting). It is anticipated that the outstanding 2003 and 2004 awards will lapse shortly due to non-achievement of the performance conditions.
In the case of annual awards made under the LTIP in respect of 2005 and 2006, the performance condition for vesting is Median TSR
(for 35% vesting) over the respective three-year performance period, increasing to Median TSR + 5% (for 100% vesting). Where performance
falls between these two points of reference the proportion of LTIPs vesting increases on a straight line basis between 35% and 100%. Median
TSR is currently measured as the FTSE Small Cap Index.
In 2006 there was also an exceptional LTIP award. This exceptional LTIP award was conditional upon the agreement of the refinancing which
was completed in April 2006, and therefore the performance criteria have been satisfied in full.
A total of 1,261,404 options were awarded under the LTIP in respect of the year ended 31 December 2006. The following table sets out the
interests of the Executive Directors in awards under the LTIP as at 31 December 2006.

a The awards in respect of the year ended 31 December 2003 were planned to be made in April 2003 but, for legal reasons, could not be made until January 2004. The
terms on which the awards were made were such as to ensure that the participants were neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by the delay in the making of the awards.
b An exceptional LTIP award was made in 2006 conditional upon the agreement and draw down of refinancing facilities.
c LTIP awards are calculated using the market value on the date the Committee agrees to recommend the grant to the Trustees. The market value at date of award may
differ from the original figure due to share price movement. (7) External Appointments of Executive Directors
It is recognised that by holding the office of a Non-Executive Director of another company, an Executive Director may gain valuable knowledge
and experience that can benefit the Group. All external directorships require prior Board approval. John Merry is currently a Non-Executive
Director of Edmunds Holding Company Inc.
(8) Performance Graph
The Company's total shareholder return performance, for the five years to 31 March 2007 is shown on the graph below compared to the
average performance achieved by companies within the FTSE Small Cap Index.
In the opinion of the Directors, the FTSE Small Cap Index is currently the most appropriate index against which the total shareholder return of
the Company should be measured because it is an index of similar sized companies.
The middle market price of an ordinary share in the Company on 31 December 2006 was 101.8p. The middle market price of an ordinary share
in the Company during the year ranged from 58.5p to 127.0p.
(9) Directors' Service Contracts, Emoluments and Pensions
(i) Service contracts
The Executive Directors have rolling service contracts with the following notice periods:
Contract date Notice period

These service contracts contain non-compete obligations in the event of termination.
The service contracts do not provide for any termination payments, save that if they are terminated by the Company in accordance with
their terms, the Company may elect to pay the Executive Director his salary and benefits in lieu of notice. The Non-Executive Directors do not
have service contracts. The terms of their appointment are reviewed by the Board at least every three years, and are available for inspection
upon request.
