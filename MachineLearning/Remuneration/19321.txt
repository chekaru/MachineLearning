DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
1. INTRODUCTION
Notwithstanding the move of the Company to AIM in September 2006, this Report has been approved by the Board and will  
be subject to an advisory Shareholder vote at the AGM substantially as if the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002  
(the  Regulations') continued to apply in full to the Company. The Report is intended to be in full compliance with the requirements  
of the Regulations. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have audited Sections 5, 6 and 9 as required by the Regulations.
2. COMPOSITION OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee (the  Committee') is chaired by John Davies and also comprises Reg Heath and Mark Butcher.  
The members of the Committee and their attendance at meetings for the year are shown on page 22. The Committee is 
responsible for determining the remuneration packages and conditions of employment (including share-based benefits and 
contractual notice periods) of the Executive Directors, the Non-Executive Chairman and the Company Secretary.
3. REMUNERATION OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are set by the Board and are reviewed at least every 3 years. The review takes account of 
fees paid for similar positions in the market, together with any additional responsibilities undertaken by the Director, such as acting 
as Chairman to one of the Board Committees. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to receive pension entitlements or bonuses 
and may not participate in share option schemes. The Non-Executive Directors and their respective annual fees for 2008 are shown 
in full on page 21.
4. POLICY ON REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND SENIOR EXECUTIVES
The objective of the Committee's remuneration policy is to ensure that members of the Management of the Group are provided 
with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their 
individual contributions to the success of the Group. Each remuneration package is deemed appropriate for the responsibilities  
of the individual, taking into consideration the overall financial and business position of the Group and the importance of recruiting, 
motivating and retaining management of the appropriate calibre. The policy is aligned with the recommendation of the Combined 
Code on Directors' Remuneration and will be kept under review in subsequent years to ensure that it reflects changing 
circumstances. The following summarises the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors:
i. BASE SALARY AND BENEFITS
The base salary, pension and benefits of Executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee. When 
determining base salaries, the Remuneration Committee takes into account the individual's experience, contribution and 
performance while having regard to the practice of comparable companies, supported where appropriate by external independent 
surveys and external remuneration consultants.
ii. EXECUTIVE BONUS SCHEME
The Executive Directors would normally participate in the Company's Senior Management Bonus Scheme. For the year ended  
31 December 2008, due to significant organisational changes and the number of historical issues discovered within the business, 
bonus scheme awards were made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
iii. SHARE INCENTIVES AND LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (THE  LTIP')
The Executive Directors participate in an appropriate share incentive scheme in the form of LTIPs, which are explained below.
5. SHARE INCENTIVES
The Company has 3 share incentive schemes in operation: an Inland Revenue approved Executive Share Option Scheme,  
an unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme and an LTIP . 
No options have been issued under the Executive Share Option Schemes since 2004. All Executive share options are exercisable 
only on meeting pre-determined 3-year performance targets which were set when the options were awarded. Note 29 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements discloses the number of these options outstanding and exercisable during the year and as  
at 31 December 2008.   Autologic Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 19
6. LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (THE  LTIP')
The LTIP was introduced in 2002, following approval at the AGM held in May 2002. The LTIP is designed to motivate its 
participants to improve the Group's performance over the longer term. 
The LTIP is operated through an Employee Benefit Trust managed by independent Trustees. Awards are made at the discretion of 
the Trustees having regard to the recommendation of the Committee. Shares required to satisfy awards which vest are transferred  
by the Trustees to the relevant participants. 
Vesting of awards under the LTIP is subject to satisfaction of challenging performance conditions set by the Remuneration 
Committee. Awards under the LTIP will, if the performance conditions have been satisfied, normally vest on the third anniversary of 
the date of award. Awards will not normally vest unless performance conditions have been satisfied over the relevant performance 
period (typically 3 years), or there has been a significant and sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the 
Group. The number of shares which may vest under the LTIP is based on the extent to which the performance target attached to  
a particular award under the LTIP has been met.
As reported in the placing circular to Shareholders dated 31 January 2007, the Company introduced a new LTIP scheme for a 
limited number of Executive Directors and senior executives following consultation with its major institutional Shareholders, under 
which LTIPs were issued in 2007 and early in 2008. The option holders are entitled to subscribe for shares at a fixed exercise price 
provided that challenging share price performance criteria have been achieved. One third of the option shares vest upon attainment 
of the lower share price target and the balance of the option shares vest proportionately on a straight-line basis up to the higher 
share price target. When the LTIPs were awarded in 2007, the exercise price was set at 75.0p, which was equal to the placing 
price at that time, and the share price targets were 140.0p and 240.0p. For awards made in 2008, the exercise price and share 
price targets are set according to the average share price for the period 5 days prior to the announcement of the appointment  
of the Executive Director.
The following table sets out the interests of the Executive Directors who held office during 2008 in awards under the LTIP as at  
31 December 2008:
