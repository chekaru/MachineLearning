Directors' Remuneration Report >
1. Introduction
This Report has been approved by the Board and will be subject to an advisory Shareholder vote at the AGM.
2. Composition of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the  Committee') is chaired by John Davies, includes Mark Butcher and previously included  
Reg Heath prior to his resignation. The members of the Committee and their attendance at meetings for the year are shown  
on page 24. The Committee is responsible for determining the remuneration packages and conditions of employment (including 
share-based benefits and contractual notice periods) of the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary.
3. Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors
The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are set by the Board and are reviewed at least every 3 years. The review takes account of 
fees paid for similar positions in the market, together with any additional responsibilities undertaken by the Director, such as acting 
as Chairman to one of the Board Committees. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to receive pension entitlements or bonuses 
and may not participate in share option schemes. The Non-Executive Directors and their respective annual fees for 2009 are shown 
in full on page 23.
4. Policy on Remuneration of Executive Directors
The objective of the Committee's remuneration policy is to ensure that the Executive Directors are provided with appropriate 
incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions 
to the success of the Group. Each remuneration package is deemed appropriate for the responsibilities of the individual, taking into 
consideration the overall financial and business position of the Group and the importance of recruiting, motivating and retaining 
management of the appropriate calibre. 
The following summarises the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors: 
i. Base Salary and Benefits
The base salary, pension and benefits of Executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Committee. When determining base 
salaries, the Committee takes into account the individual's experience, contribution and performance while having regard to the 
practice of comparable companies, supported where appropriate by external independent surveys and external remuneration 
consultants.
ii. Executive Bonus Scheme
The Executive Directors would normally participate in the Company's Senior Management Bonus Scheme. For the year ended  
31 December 2009, due to the significant restructuring undertaken within the business and the unstable market conditions,  
bonus awards were made at the discretion of the Committee. 
iii. Share Incentives and Long Term Incentive Plan (the  LTIP')
The Executive Directors participate in an appropriate share incentive scheme, either in the form of an Executive Share Option 
Scheme or LTIPs, which are explained below.
5. Share Incentive Schemes
The Company has 2 share incentive schemes in operation: an Inland Revenue approved Executive Share Option Scheme and  
an unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme. 
The Executive share options are ordinarily exercisable only on meeting pre-determined 3 year performance targets which are  
set when the options are awarded. Following consultation with its major institutional Shareholders, the Company introduced an 
unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme in 2009, under which options were issued in September 2009. The option holders  
are entitled to subscribe for shares at a fixed exercise price of 33 pence. No options have been issued under the Inland Revenue 
approved Executive Share Option Scheme since 2004. Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discloses the number  
of options outstanding and exercisable during the year and as at 31 December 2009.  Autologic Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 21

6. Long Term Incentive Plan (the  LTIP')
The LTIP was introduced in 2002, following approval at the AGM held in May 2002. The LTIP is designed to motivate its 
participants to improve the Group's performance over the longer term. 
The LTIP is operated through an Employee Benefit Trust managed by independent Trustees. Awards are made at the discretion of 
the Trustees having regard to the recommendation of the Committee. Shares required to satisfy awards which vest are transferred  
by the Trustees to the relevant participants. 
Vesting of awards under the LTIP is subject to satisfaction of performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee. Awards 
will not normally vest unless performance conditions have been satisfied over the relevant performance period (typically 3 years),  
or there has been a significant and sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group. LTIPs held by  
Avril Palmer-Baunack and Andrew Somerville under this scheme were forfeited in September 2009.
The following table sets out the interests of the Executive Directors who held office during 2009 in awards under the LTIP as at
