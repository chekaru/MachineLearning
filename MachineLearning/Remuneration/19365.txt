Directors' Remuneration Report >
1. Introduction
This Report has been approved by the Board and will be subject to an advisory Shareholder vote at the AGM.
2. Composition of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the  Committee') is chaired by John Davies and includes Mark Butcher. The members of the 
Committee and their attendance at meetings for the year are shown on page 21. The Committee is responsible for determining  
the remuneration packages and conditions of employment (including share-based benefits and contractual notice periods) of  
the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary.
3. Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors
The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are set by the Board and are reviewed at least every 3 years. Non-Executive Directors  
are not eligible to receive pension entitlements or bonuses and may not participate in share option schemes. The Non-Executive 
Directors and their respective annual fees for 2010 are shown in full on page 20.
4. Policy on Remuneration of Executive Directors
The objective of the Committee's remuneration policy is to ensure that the Executive Directors are provided with appropriate 
incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions 
to the success of the Group. Each remuneration package is deemed appropriate for the responsibilities of the individual, taking into 
consideration the overall financial and business position of the Group and the importance of recruiting, motivating and retaining 
management of the appropriate calibre. The following summarises the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors: 
i. Base Salary and Benefits
The base salary, pension and benefits of Executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Committee. When determining base 
salaries, the Committee takes into account the individual's experience, contribution and performance while having regard to the 
practice of comparable companies, supported where appropriate by external independent surveys and external remuneration 
consultants.
ii. Executive Bonus Scheme
For the year ended 31 December 2010, the executive bonus scheme was based on the achievement of the 2010 budgeted profit 
and other key objectives. 
iii. Share Incentives
The Executive Directors participate in an Executive Share Option Scheme, which was introduced in September 2009 following 
consultation with the Company's major institutional Shareholders. The following table sets out the interests of the Executive Directors 
who held office during 2010:
