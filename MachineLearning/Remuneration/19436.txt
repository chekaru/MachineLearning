 Remuneration Report 41
Remuneration Report 
Compliance
The constitution and operation of the Remuneration Committee is in compliance with the principles of Section 1 of the 
Combined Code. 
Members of the Remuneration Committee 
The members of the Remuneration Committee are Messrs. Ariko and McMonigall.  The chairman of the committee is 
Mr. Ariko. 
Governing Principles 
The Remuneration Committee is primarily responsible for reviewing and approving general compensation policies and 
setting compensation levels for executive officers.  The committee also administers incentive compensation plans.  
Consistent with the policies of the Combined Code, our policy for directors' remuneration for 2004 and subsequent 
financial years is that packages are intended to attract, motivate and retain directors of the calibre needed to achieve 
our growth program but not detract from the goals of good corporate governance.  Remuneration elsewhere within the 
company is taken into account when determining executive compensation.  Our highest paid employee earns a base 
salary approximately four times the base salary of the average employee. 
The main elements of executive pay packages historically and for the expected future are: 
 Base salary and benefits.  Each senior executive's basic salary is determined by the Committee, taking into 
account the performance of the individual and our strategies.  Employment related benefits (principally the 
provision of a company car) are also provided where appropriate.  In accordance with our strategies and the 
significant equity interests of the executive directors in the company, directors' salaries have not been adjusted 
during the previous four years, with the exception of the Chief Financial Officer who received a small raise 
during 2003 when he joined the Board to align his base salary with industry norms. 
 Bonuses.  In accordance with common practice amongst our peers, we have performance related bonus plans 
for certain executive directors, discussed below.  Bonuses are paid based on achievement of pre-agreed 
revenue and profit targets. 
 Share options.  We believe that share ownership by directors and staff aligns their personal interests with 
those of shareholders.  Options form the core element of our performance program, and are granted in small 
amounts from time-to-time based on an individual's exceptional performance and significant and continuing 
contribution to performance of the company.  These share option awards are then subject to vesting periods, 
with initial vesting generally after six or 12 months with the remainder vesting quarterly over a total of 2.5 to 
3.5 years.  The requirement for individuals to perform prior to granting options has been very effective in 
motivating performance.  It enables us to specifically tailor share option grants to an individual's role in an 
efficient manner.  For example, a programmer might be awarded a small share option grant for completion of 
a project ahead of schedule, or the Chief Operating Officer might be awarded a small share option grant for 
effective integration of an acquired company.  This method also keeps individuals continuously incentivized as 
a grantee must remain employed in good standing to achieve full vesting of the options.  Finally, this method 
is also designed to ensure that individuals are not unjustly rewarded, which we believe is more likely if large 
option grants are made with broad performance targets.  Under that method, an individual who was 
personally underperforming might nonetheless be enriched if the company met its own broader performance 
targets.  Share options are always issued at market value.  The maximum number of share options we are 
permitted to grant is up to 10% of the outstanding shares.  There has been no departure from this policy 
during 2004. 
The committee has access to professional advice from outside advisors should it require assistance, but to date has not 
sought such advice as there has been no material change in any director's remuneration.  Directors' remuneration is 
considered to be highly incentive-based given the executive directors' significant equity holdings in the company and the 
performance-based bonus plans.   The committee did not formally meet during 2004 and acted once by unanimous 
written consent. 
Service Contracts 
All executive directors have service contracts and all non-executive directors have appointment letters.  All agreements 
provide for notice of six months or less, although do not have a specified fixed term, and all permit garden leave up to 
the length of the notice period.  No other amounts are payable on termination.  All terms of appointment are subject to 
the provisions of the Companies Act 1985 and the requirement to retire by rotation on the third anniversary of the 
previous election.   Remuneration Report 42
Dr. Lynch's employment agreement, dated July 9, 1998, provides for his employment as Managing Director and Chief 
Executive Officer, at a salary of  100,000 per annum.  Mr. Gaunt's employment agreement, dated July 9, 1998, 
provides for his employment as our Technical Director, at a salary of  54,000 per annum.  Both Dr. Lynch and Mr. 
Gaunt have also entered into part-time employment agreements with Neurodynamics Limited.  Each retain their 
earnings from Neurodynamics Limited, which on an annual basis are immaterial.  Their Autonomy service agreements 
limit their services to Neurodynamics to a maximum of one quarter of each of their total monthly working time, which to 
date in practice has been immaterial.  In accordance with common practice amongst the company's peers, Dr. Lynch 
may be entitled to a performance bonus for 2004 of up to  50,000 based on revenue and earnings targets for 2004.
Mr. Hussain's employment agreement, dated June 27, 2001, provides for his employment as Chief Financial Officer, at 
a salary of  135,000 per annum.  Each are also entitled to current benefits generally made available to all employees 
and any fees or remuneration he is entitled to as a director of Autonomy.  Each of these agreements has no fixed term 
and can be terminated by either party on six months' notice, or payment of six months' salary in lieu of notice.  For a 
fixed period following the termination of employment, each of Dr. Lynch and Messrs. Gaunt and Hussain are prohibited 
from soliciting our clients, customers and employees and from competing with us in a similar geographic area. 
Messrs. Ariko, McMonigall and Perle serve as our directors under appointment letters dated January 7, 2000, July 2, 
1998 and February 23, 2000, respectively.  Under these letters, Messrs. Ariko and Perle are each paid an annual fee 
of $25,000, and Apax Partners & Co. Ventures Ltd., on behalf of Mr. McMonigall, is paid an annual fee of  10,000 for 
his services as a director.  Either party to each of these letters may terminate the appointment upon three months' 
notice or payment in lieu of notice. 
Details of Directors' service contracts are available on the company's website.  No Director is entitled to any automatic 
payment by virtue of a change in control of the company or for other termination.  Directors' remuneration is not linked 
to share price performance.
