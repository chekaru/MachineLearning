 Remuneration Report 
 15 Autonomy Corporation plc 
The directors present their report on directors' remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2007. 
 
Compliance 
The constitution and operation of the Remuneration Committee is in compliance with the principles of Section 1 of the 2006 FRC 
Combined Code.   
UNAUDITED REMUNERATION INFORMATION 
Members of the Remuneration Committee 
The members of the Remuneration Committee are Messrs. Ariko, McMonigall and Perle.  The chairman of the committee is Mr. Ariko. 
Governing Principles 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving general compensation policies and setting compensation levels 
for executive officers.  The committee also administers incentive compensation plans.  Consistent with the policies of the 2006 FRC 
Combined Code, the company's policy for directors' remuneration for 2007 and subsequent financial years is that packages are intended 
to attract, motivate and retain directors of the calibre needed to achieve the company's growth program but not detract from the goals of 
good corporate governance.  Remuneration elsewhere within the company is taken into account when determining executive 
compensation.  The company's highest paid employee earns a base salary approximately five times the base salary of the average 
employee. 
The main elements of executive pay packages historically and for the expected future are: 
  Base salary and benefits.  Each senior executive's basic salary is determined by the Committee, taking into account the 
performance of the individual and the company's strategies.  Employment related benefits (principally the provision of a 
company car) are also provided where appropriate.   Executive directors' base salaries are low relative to similarly situated 
companies, with performance-based incentive compensation forming the most important factor in overall compensation. 
  Bonuses.  In accordance with common practice amongst the company's peers, the company has performance related bonus 
plans for certain executive directors, discussed below.  Bonuses are paid based on achievement of pre-agreed targets. 
  Share options.  The Board believes that share ownership by directors and staff aligns their personal interests with those of 
shareholders.  Options form the core element of the company's performance program, and are granted in small amounts from 
time-to-time after achievement of stretching performance targets and significant continuing contribution to value creation.  
These share option awards are then subject to vesting periods, with initial vesting generally after six or 12 months with the 
remainder vesting quarterly over a total of 2.5 to 3.5 years.   
The requirement for individuals to perform prior to granting options has been very effective in motivating performance, 
achieving targets and most importantly minimizing reward unconnected to an individual's performance.  It enables the company 
to specifically tailor share option grants to an individual's role in an efficient manner, thus avoiding the risks faced by 
companies in a high growth sector of unjust reward associated with simple, broad targets attached only to option exercises.  
For example, a programmer might be awarded a small grant for completion of a project ahead of schedule, or a local 
operations manager might be awarded a small grant for effective integration of an acquired company.  This method also keeps 
individuals continuously incentivized as a grantee must remain employed to achieve full vesting of the options.  Finally, this 
method is also designed to ensure that individuals are not unjustly rewarded, which the Board believes is much more likely if 
large option grants are made with broad performance targets.  Under that method, an individual who was personally 
underperforming would undoubtedly be enriched if the company met its own broader performance targets, without making any 
material contribution. 
It is expected that in February 2008 at the next meeting of the Remuneration Committee that new share option grants will be 
proposed for executive directors with new performance conditions related to the exercise of such options. 
The Board sets reasonable individual grant limits.  As a result, at 31 December 2007, the Board collectively held options over 
less than 0.3% of outstanding equity, and options granted to the Board during 2007 totalled less than 0.09%, of the company's 
outstanding shares at 31 December 2007.  The total number of options granted to Board members totalled less than 7.75% of 
all share options outstanding at 31 December 2007. 
Share options are always issued at market value.  The maximum number of share options the company is permitted to grant is 
up to 10% of the outstanding shares.  There has been no departure from this policy during 2007. 
Advice 
The committee has access to professional advice from outside advisors should it require assistance.  During 2007 the directors relied on 
information contained in generally available reports but did not engage any firm.  Directors' remuneration is considered to be highly 
incentive-based given the executive directors' significant equity holdings in the company and the performance-based bonus plans. 
Considerations 
The committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting remuneration of 
executive directors, and to date has had no reason to believe that the inventive structure for senior management raises risks related to 
such matters by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.    Remuneration Report

Service Contracts 
The company's policies prohibit long-fixed contracts and contractual termination payments.  The company requires mutual notice periods 
for directors, but never in excess of 12 months.  All executive directors have service contracts and all non-executive directors have 
appointment letters.  All agreements provide for notice of 12 months or less, although do not have a specified fixed term, and all permit 
garden leave up to the length of the notice period.  No other amounts are payable on termination.  All terms of appointment are subject to 
the provisions of the Companies Act 1985 and the requirement to retire by rotation on the third anniversary of the previous election.   
Details of directors' service contracts are available on the company's website.  No director is entitled to any automatic payment by virtue of 
early termination of their contract or a change in control of the company.  Directors' remuneration is not linked to share price performance.  
Details of executive directors service contracts are as follows:

Sushovan Hussain, Chief Financial Officer ................................... 27 June 2001  225,000 50% of salary 12 months 
 
Executive directors' bonus targets in 2007 were for achieving (i) organic revenue growth of at least 15% and (ii) adjusted earnings per 
share growth of at least 35%. The targets were selected as objective, challenging growth targets designed to meet the growth objectives 
of the company.  In selecting the targets and levels of compensation the committee reviewed the plans of similarly situated technology 
companies.  Each target was achieved. 
Each executive director is entitled to current benefits generally made available to all employees and any fees or remuneration he is 
entitled to as a director of Autonomy.  Payment of salary in lieu of notice is permitted on termination.  For a fixed period following the 
termination of employment, each of Dr. Lynch and Mr. Hussain are prohibited from soliciting the company's clients, customers and 
employees and from competing with us in a similar geographic area. 
Messrs. Ariko, McMonigall and Perle serve as directors under appointment letters dated 7 January 2000, 2 July 1998 and 23 February 
2000, respectively.  Under these letters as updated, Messrs. Ariko, McMonigall and Perle are each entitled to an annual fee of $50,000.  
Either party to each of these letters may terminate the appointment upon three months' notice or payment of salary in lieu of notice.  
Mr. Gaunt serves as a director under an appointment letter dated 9 July 1998.  Under this letter, as updated, Mr Gaunt is entitled to an 
annual fee of  18,000.  Either party may terminate the appointment upon six months' notice or payment of salary in lieu of notice.

(1) Vesting schedule is either over a period of three or four years, with the first instalment exercisable after a cliff  of either six months or one year.  After 
the initial tranche vesting, additional tranches vest in equal quarterly instalments over the remainder of the vesting period.   
(2) First exercise  represents the date of the vesting of the initial tranche when a small portion of the options become available for exercise. 
(3) Granted as a bonus following achievement of pre-determined acquisition integration targets. 
 
As of the date of this report, no non-executive directors held share options.  The Board does not intend to grant options to non-executive 
directors. Options are granted to all employees in the company on the same terms and at an exercise price equal to the fair market value 
on the date of grant.  The fair market value of the company's ordinary shares as quoted on the London Stock Exchange on 31 December 
2007 (the last trading day of the year) was  8.84 per ordinary share, and the range during the year ended 31 December 2007 was from 
 5.115 to  10.38. 
Pension entitlements 
During 2006 the company established a matching pension scheme available to all U.K. employees with more than three years' service.  
The scheme provides for the company to make a matching contribution to an individual employee's pension, up to 3% of the individual's 
base salary per annum.  Other than this generally available benefit, the directors do not have pension, retirement or similar entitlements. 
Dr. Lynch and Mr. Hussain participated in the matching pension scheme during 2007 on the same terms available to all U.K. employees, 
and matching contributions of  7,500 and  6,750 respectively (2006 (partial year, scheme launched late in the year):  1,950 and  1,755) 
were paid by the company. 
Former Directors 
No payments or awards were made to former directors during the year. 
By order of the Board,
