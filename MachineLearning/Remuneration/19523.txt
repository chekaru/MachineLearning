 Remuneration Report 
Autonomy Corporation plc     Annual Report and Accounts 2009     27  
Dear Shareholder, 
I am pleased to present the report by the Remuneration Committee on 
directors' remuneration for 2009 and plans for 2010. 
As set out in the Chairman and Chief Executive's statements, Autonomy 
had another record year in 2009 despite the difficult economic conditions 
that affected the global economy, following on from an excellent 2008.  
Against this background, remuneration policies for 2009 were set at the 
outset of 2009 and have now been set for 2010.   
Whilst Autonomy's financial and share price performance have been 
extraordinary, compensation policies have limited remuneration to one of 
the most modest packages in the FTSE 100.  The Board however 
recognizes the value of ongoing discussions with shareholders on the 
matter, and throughout 2009 we maintained an extensive dialog with 
shareholders regarding the most appropriate compensation for Autonomy's 
executive directors.  During 2009, the company conducted a wide ranging 
and in-depth review of remuneration strategy for executive directors.  
This report reflects compensation for 2009 and new changes which have 
come into place for 2010.   
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the changes made are 
appropriate particularly in light of the company's performance and historical 
pay practices.  The Remuneration Committee believes that the 
remuneration policy detailed in this report is appropriate to enable 
Autonomy to recruit the people we need, and retain and motivate those 
already with us at this critical time.  The Remuneration Committee 
considers that the individual elements of the remuneration package that will 
apply in 2010 constitute an appropriate balance between fixed and variable 
compensation. 
As well as considering current arrangements, the Remuneration Committee 
continues to monitor how well incentive awards made in previous years 
align with the company's performance.  In this regard, the Committee is 
confident that there has been and remains a strong link between 
performance and reward, which is evidence in results and share price 
performance. 
The Remuneration Committee has appreciated the dialogue and feedback 
from investors over the past years and will continue to take an active 
interest in their views and the voting on the remuneration report.  As such, it 
hopes to receive your support at the AGM on 24 March 2010.

Chairman, Remuneration Committee

Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee is comprised to exercise independent 
judgement and consists only of independent non-executive directors.  The 
Remuneration Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving 
general compensation policies and setting compensation levels for 
executive officers.  The committee also administers incentive compensation 
plans.  For further details, a description of the terms of reference can be 
found on page 25. 
External advisers 
During the year, the committee relied on information contained in generally 
available reports from Towers Perrin and Hewitt.  Deloitte LLP also 
supplied market data, advice on market practice and governance, 
performance analysis and advice on plan design and performance 
measures.  Deloitte are also the company auditors and their advice in 
relation to remuneration has been provided in compliance with the terms of 
reference of the Audit Committee and the Ethical Standards of the Auditing 
Practices Board. 
Meetings
The Remuneration Committee had one scheduled and a further two ad hoc 
meetings during the year, and acted by written consent. 
Overview of Remuneration Philosophy 
Remuneration Policy 
The Remuneration Committee again reviewed remuneration and reward 
arrangements for the company's executive directors in 2009.  Consistent 
with the policies of the Combined Code, the company's policy for directors' 
remuneration is that packages are intended to attract, motivate and retain 
directors of the highest calibre.  To maximise the effectiveness of the 
remuneration policy, careful consideration is given to aligning the 
remuneration package with shareholder interests and best practice. 
The aim is to target an appropriate level of remuneration in order to achieve 
the company's growth program but not detract from the goals of good 
corporate governance.   
In setting total remuneration, the Remuneration Committee considers a 
relevant group of comparators, selected on the basis of the role being 
considered.  In 2009 the relevant reference point was deemed to be the 
broader FTSE 100 and practice amongst international sectoral peers.   
Historically and on a go-forward basis a high proportion of total 
remuneration has been and will be awarded through short term and long 
term performance related remuneration.  The Remuneration Committee 
believes that incorporating and setting appropriate performance measures 
and targets in the package is paramount; this will be reflected in an 
appropriate balance of operational and equity performance. 
Remuneration elsewhere within the company is taken into account when 
determining executive compensation.  The company's highest paid 
employee earns a base salary approximately 4.65 times the base salary of 
the average employee. 
Applicability 
The remuneration policy applies to executive directors.  The Committee 
believes that his significant equity investment in the company aligns his 
interests with shareholders.    Remuneration Report

Compliance
The Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008.  It also describes how the 
principles set out in the Combined Code have been applied in relation to 
the remuneration for the current and forthcoming financial years.  Deloitte 
LLP has audited the contents of the report to the extent required by the 
Companies Act. 
Changes for 2010 
For convenience, the table below sets out a summary of changes to the 
individual elements of the remuneration packages which will be effective for 
2010 for executive directors, discussed in more detail below.   
Element Changes for 2010 
Base salary ........................ No change to the benchmarking policy 
Benefits .............................. No new benefits 
Pensions ............................ No change to 3% capped matching pension 
Annual Cash Bonus ........... No change to maximum bonus or 
performance conditions 
Deferred Bonus .................. Amended plan introduced for 2010 with 
grant deferred subject to financial 
performance targets 
Deferred Shares Bonus...... New policy introduced for 2010 with vesting 
subject to performance over 3 years 
Remuneration Elements 
The main elements of executive remuneration packages historically and for 
the expected future are: 
Base Salary 
The Remuneration Committee considers the level of base salary for each 
executive director annually, taking into account the performance of the 
individual and the company's strategies.  The Remuneration Committee 
also takes into account salaries in relevant comparable companies, specific 
factors relating to the individual, internal relatives and overall affordability.  
In establishing individual salary levels, the Remuneration Committee is 
conscious that it should pay no more than is necessary to retain and 
motivate the executive, while ensuring business objectives are fulfilled.  
There is no automatic adjustment in respect of inflation.  Executive 
directors' base salaries are low relative to similarly situated companies, with 
performance-based incentive compensation forming the most important 
factor in overall compensation.   
2009 salaries and benefits for the CEO and CFO were approved by the 
Board in early 2009 based on performance during 2008, which included 
record operating profits (adj.) up 91% from the prior year, and the fact that 
executive director compensation was amongst the lowest of similarly sized 
companies despite extraordinary performance.   
Given the company's significant growth, continued strong performance in 
2009, market positioning against UK and US comparators, the lack of 
generous pension entitlements and increase in size of roles, base salary 
raises of 9% for 2010 were approved, raising the CEO's salary for 2010 to 
 343,350 (2009:  315,000) and the CFO's salary to  309,015 (2009: 
 283,500).  The executive directors' base salaries remain in the bottom 
quartile of comparable companies. 
Benefits 
Limited employment-related benefits are provided, consisting only of 
company car or car allowance and basic private medical insurance.  
Remuneration relatively common amongst peers which is not provided 
includes:   final salary pensions; executive director-specific pensions; tax 
advice; premium private health care; exit packages other than standard 
notice periods; guaranteed bonuses; or director-specific equity plans.   
Pensions
During 2006 the company established a matching pension scheme 
available to all U.K. employees with more than three years' service.  The 
scheme provides for the company to make a matching contribution to an 
individual employee's pension, up to 3% of the individual's base salary 
(only) per annum.  Other than this generally available benefit, the directors 
do not have pension, retirement or similar entitlements. 
Bonuses
In accordance with common practice amongst the company's peers, the 
company has performance-related bonus remuneration for certain 
executive directors.  Bonuses are intended to encourage the achievement 
of pre-defined annual financial objectives and to focus on the most 
important measures of business success, while rewarding individuals for 
outstanding performance.  In this way executive bonuses seek to align the 
interests of shareholders and those eligible. 
Cash Bonus.  Executive directors are eligible for a bonus of 50% of base 
salary for basic achievement and up to an additional 50% of base salary for 
over performance against pre-agreed financial targets.   
For 2009, the financial targets for executive directors for basic performance 
were (i) organic revenue growth of at least 15% and (ii) adjusted earnings 
per share growth of at least 30%, weighted 50%/50% for bonus purposes.  
Over-performance targets enabled an additional payout of 25% of base 
salary for exceeding adjusted earnings per share growth of 30%, and an 
additional 25% for adjusted earnings per share exceeding 103 cents.  For 
2009 each of the basic targets were achieved, as well as the first over-
performance target, resulting in a bonus entitlement of 75% of base salary 
for each of Dr. Lynch and Mr. Hussain.  The targets were selected as 
objective, challenging growth targets designed to meet the growth 
objectives of the company.  In selecting the targets and levels of 
compensation the committee reviewed the plans of similarly situated 
technology companies and analyst consensus forecasts.   
Deferred Bonus.  For 2010, the Board has adopted a new deferred bonus 
policy for executive directors.  The Board believes that share ownership by 
directors and staff aligns their personal interests with those of shareholders.   
Executive directors will be granted share options following achievement of 
pre-agreed financial targets, with vesting over subsequent years.  
Executive directors will be eligible for a single annual grant of up to 150,000 
share options if the performance level is achieved.  Grants will vest from 
the date of award over the subsequent three years.  The first grant would 
be in January 2011 for achievement of 2010 targets.  No other share 
options will be granted to executive directors in 2010 other than under this 
policy.   
The Board sets reasonable individual grant limits.  As a result, at 
31 December 2009, the Board collectively held options over less than 0.3% 
of outstanding equity, and options granted to the Board during 2009 totalled 
0.03% of the company's outstanding shares at 31 December 2009.  
Options granted to Board members during 2009 totalled less than 9% of all 
share options outstanding at 31 December 2009. 
Share options are always issued at market value.  The maximum number of 
share options the company is permitted to grant is up to 10% of the 
outstanding shares.  There has been no departure from this policy during 
2009.  Remuneration Report 
Autonomy Corporation plc     Annual Report and Accounts 2009     29  
Deferred Shares Bonus.  For 2010 the Board has approved a new 
performance share policy as part of the remuneration arrangements.  Any 
ordinary shares granted under the policy will be satisfied from the 
company's Employee Benefit Trust, thus will be non-dilutive to 
shareholders. 
The maximum annual award level for executive directors for 2010 is 100% 
of base salary.  Vesting of awards is based on meeting stretching 
performance targets over a three year performance period and, subject to 
meeting all relevant conditions, shares will normally be released to 
participants as soon as possible following the third anniversary of the 
award.   
Performance is measured against total shareholder return versus the 
constituents of the FTSE 100 at date of grant.  This measure was chosen 
as the most relevant index of which the company is a constituent.   
For 2010, 25% of an award will vest for performance equal to the 
FTSE 100's median performance three years hence.  100% of the award 
will vest for performance placing the company in the top 75th percentile of 
the FTSE 100's performance three years hence.  The award will vest on a 
straight line basis for performance in between the median and the top 
quartile.  No shares will vest for performance below the median.   
The Remuneration Committee will in all cases retain discretion to ensure 
that, as a condition for the vesting of shares, the underlying overall 
performance of the company has been satisfactory.  Vested awards will 
include adjustments for any dividends, share splits or similar corporate 
actions throughout the vesting period.   
If a participant resigns or is dismissed before shares are released, they will 
be forfeited.  The Remuneration Committee will have discretion to 
accelerate vesting in compassionate circumstances.  In the event of a 
change of control during the performance period, performance will be 
measured at the latest possible date before the change of control to assess 
the proportion vesting based on performance.  The proportion of the award 
that may be released will then be time pro rated.  The Remuneration 
Committee will have discretion to disapply the impact of time pro rating and 
to permit up to 100% of awards to vest on a change of control if, due to 
exceptional business circumstances, returns to shareholders are 
considered to be at a superior level.   
Non-Executive Director Remuneration 
Fees for non-executive directors are determined taking into account 
expected time commitments and responsibilities, together with comparative 
market rates and benchmarking data.   
Non-executive directors are entitled to basic fees only.  For 2009 basic fees 
were set at $80,500 (or  50,000) per annum for all non-executive directors, 
except Mr. Gaunt whose fees were  35,000.  For 2010 basic fees for all 
non-executive directors have been set at  60,000 (or $96,000) per annum.  
For 2010, an additional fee of  20,000 is to be paid to the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee.  The Chairman of the Board earns a fee of  120,000 per 
annum, which will remain the same in 2010.   
Non-executive directors do not participate in any bonus or performance-
related plans or any of the group's share incentive, option or pension 
schemes. 
Other Incentive Schemes 
Options form the core element of the company's deferred bonus program 
for the broader employee base, and are granted in small amounts from 
time-to-time to a very broad set of the company's employees after 
achievement of stretching performance targets and significant continuing 
contribution to value creation.  After grant share option awards are then 
subject to vesting periods, with initial vesting after six or 12 months with the 
remainder vesting over a total of 2.5 to 3.5 years.  Executive Directors 
participated in this scheme in prior years but no longer do so. 
The requirement for individuals to perform prior to granting options has 
been very effective in motivating performance, achieving targets and (most 
importantly) minimizing reward unconnected to an individual's performance.  
It enables the company to specifically tailor grants to an individual's role in 
an efficient manner.  This method also keeps individuals continuously 
incentivized as a grantee must remain employed to achieve full vesting of 
the options.  This method is also designed to ensure that individuals are not 
unjustly rewarded, which the Board believes is much more likely if large 
option grants are made with broad performance targets.  Under that 
method, an individual who was personally underperforming would 
undoubtedly be enriched if the company met its own broader performance 
targets, without making any material contribution, particularly given the 
company's rapid growth and share price appreciation. 
Service Contracts 
Policy
The Combined Code and guidelines issued by institutional investors 
recommend that notice periods of no more than one year be set as an 
objective for executive directors and that any payments to a departing 
executive director should be determined having full regard to the duty of 
mitigation.  The company has achieved these objectives in all respects.   
The company's policies prohibit long-fixed contracts and contractual 
termination payments.  The company requires mutual notice periods for 
directors, but never in excess of 12 months.  All executive directors have 
service contracts and all non-executive directors have appointment letters.  
All agreements provide for notice of 12 months or less, although do not 
have a specified fixed term, and all permit garden leave up to the length of 
the notice period.  No other amounts are payable on termination.  All terms 
of appointment are subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 
and the requirement to retire by rotation on the third anniversary of the 
previous election. 
Executive Directors' Contracts 
Details of directors' service contracts are available on the company's 
website.  No director is entitled to any automatic payment by virtue of early 
termination of their contract or a change in control of the company.  Details 
of executive directors' service contracts as at the date of this report are as 
follows: 
Date
Mutual Notice 
Period 
Dr. Michael Lynch ............................. 9 July 1998 6 months 
Sushovan Hussain............................ 27 June 2001 12 months 
Each executive director is entitled to current benefits generally made 
available to all employees and any fees or remuneration he is entitled to as 
a director of Autonomy.  Payment of salary in lieu of notice is permitted on 
termination.  For a fixed period following the termination of employment, 
each of Dr. Lynch and Mr. Hussain are prohibited from soliciting the 
company's clients, customers and employees and from competing with the 
company in a similar geographic area.  Remuneration Report 
30    Autonomy Corporation plc     Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Non-Executive Directors' Contracts 
The non-executive directors serve under appointment letters with the 
Company.  All non-executive directors (including the Chairman) are 
appointed under the Company's Articles of Association, which require that 
one third of all directors (including executive directors) shall retire at each 
AGM but that all directors must seek re-election at least every three years.  
They are also subject to review by the Nominating Committee prior to being 
considered for election or re-election by shareholders. 
Details of non-executive directors' appointment letters as at the date of this 
report are as follows:

(1) Mr. Gaunt commenced service as a non-executive director in 2006. 
Either party may terminate the appointment upon three months' notice or 
payment of salary in lieu of notice.   
Non-executive directors are entitled to be reimbursed for their reasonable 
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending Board meetings and 
committees thereof.  No directors are entitled to reimbursement of non-
business expenses, and all directors are subject to the company's global 
expense policies. 
Other Considerations 
External Directorships 
Executive directors may hold positions in other companies as non-
executive directors.  In 2009, Dr. Lynch was the only executive director with 
such a position.  In connection with his services as a non-executive director 
of the BBC and blinkx Plc, during the year ended 31 December 2009 
Dr. Lynch received total remuneration of  35,000 and  35,000 (2008: 
 35,000 and  35,000) from the BBC and blinkx, respectively.  Dr. Lynch 
performs these services independently of his duties to the company and 
thus is entitled to receive such compensation. 
Performance Graph 
The accompanying graph sets forth the total shareholder return for the last

the company on the same terms and at an exercise price equal to the fair 
market value on the date of grant.  The fair market value of the company's 
ordinary shares as quoted on the London Stock Exchange on 31 December 
2009 (the last trading day of the year) was  15.03 per ordinary share, and
