  
Remuneration Report 
 
 
 
Autonomy Corporation plc     Annual Report and Accounts 2010     35  
Dear Shareholder, 
 
I am pleased to present the report by the Remuneration 
Committee on directors' remuneration for 2010 and 
plans for 2011.  I joined the Autonomy board this year 
and have taken the permanent chair of the 
Remuneration Committee.  My tenure follows the 
retirement of Barry Ariko from the Board, whom we 
warmly thank for his service.   
 
2009 and 2010 saw a complete review of Autonomy's remuneration policies 
both at a fundamental level and to ensure compliance with the guidance 
issued by the FSA and by the ABI, NAPF and RiskMetrics.  The review 
confirmed that the arrangements for the overall structure of remuneration 
for the executive directors remained broadly appropriate.  Remuneration 
policies for 2010 were set at the outset of 2010 and have now been set for 
2011.  During 2011 we will continue to review the level and methods of 
directors' remuneration to ensure it remains competitive and continues to 
be fit for purpose with a view to any appropriate changes being made for 
2012.   
 
Throughout Autonomy's rise over the past decade, compensation policies 
have limited remuneration to one of the most modest packages in the 
FTSE 100.  Revisions in 2010 were undertaken after extensive dialog with 
shareholders, which continued into 2010 and now into 2011.  As a result, 
revisions for 2011 are evolutionary rather than revolutionary.  The 
Committee continues to take a cautious position and does not feel it 
appropriate to change the basic shape of the remuneration framework.  It 
should be noted that Autonomy has very few peers on the London market 
and therefore remuneration has to compete with American and global 
software companies, the most likely competition for our talent. 
 
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the changes made are 
appropriate particularly in light of the company's performance and historical 
pay practices.  The Remuneration Committee believes that the 
remuneration policy detailed in this report will enable Autonomy to recruit 
the people we need, and retain and motivate those already with us.  The 
Remuneration Committee considers that the individual elements of the 
remuneration package that apply in 2011 constitute an appropriate balance 
between fixed and variable compensation. 
 
Salaries have been reviewed and modestly adjusted to bring senior 
management more in line with market practice, although remain in the 
bottom quartile significantly below peers.  Maximum potential bonus and 
equity awards have not changed in 2011 from 2010. 
 
In addition to its consideration of current arrangements, the Remuneration 
Committee continues to monitor how well incentive awards made in 
previous years align with the company's performance.  In this regard, the 
Committee is confident that there has been and remains a strong link 
between performance and reward. 
 
The Remuneration Committee has appreciated the dialogue and feedback 
from investors over the past years and will continue to take an active 
interest in your views.  A resolution to vote for this Directors' Remuneration 
Report will be put to the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 24 March 2011.  
I hope that you will support this resolution.

Chairman, Remuneration Committee

Remuneration Committee Governance 
 
General Governance 
The company has complied with the Principles and underlying Provisions 
relating to Directors' remuneration of the Combined Code and this 
Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the Large & 
Medium sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Report) Regulations 
2008.  The company takes significant account of guidelines issued by the 
ABI and other shareholder bodies (such as the NAPF) when setting the 
remuneration strategy for the company.  It also seeks to maintain an active 
and productive dialogue with investors on developments in the 
remuneration aspects of corporate governance generally and any changes 
to the company's executive pay arrangements in particular. 
 
Details of each individual Director's remuneration for 2010 are set out on 
page 40.  Information on Directors' share and share option interests may be 
found on pages 40 and 41. 
 
The auditor is required to report on the  auditable' part of this report and to 
state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (as amended by the 
Regulations).  The information which has been audited can be viewed on 
pages 40 and 41.  No other parts of this report have been audited.

respect of the remuneration of the Chairman.  The committee's remit 
therefore includes, but is not restricted to, 
 
 basic salary; 
 benefits in kind; 
 performance related awards; 
 share options;  
 share awards; 
 long-term incentive schemes;  
 pension rights;  
 any compensation or termination payments; and

Meetings and Activities 
The Remuneration Committee had three scheduled meetings during the 
year at which all actions were taken, as well as other ad hoc informal 
meetings, as shown on page 32. 
 
The main focus of the committee's activity comprises managing the various 
aspects of the remuneration package of Executive Directors.  This package 
comprises:  annual salary; cash bonus; deferred bonus; shares bonus; and 
other benefits available to all similarly situated employees, including 
matching pension and healthcare. 
 
The main tasks for the Committee in 2010 were:  a comprehensive review 
of the company's remuneration policies; reviewing and approving the 
Executive Directors' bonuses for 2009; setting targets and rules for 
Executive Directors' bonuses for 2010; and deciding on the level of pay 
increase in the annual salary review. 
 
Composition 
The Remuneration Committee is comprised to exercise independent 
judgement and consists only of independent non-executive directors.  The 
Remuneration Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving 
general compensation policies and setting compensation levels for 
executive officers.  The committee also administers incentive compensation 
plans.  For further details, a description of the terms of reference can be 
found on page 35. 
 
External Advisers 
During the year, the committee relied on information contained in generally 
available reports from Deloitte LLP, Towers Perrin and Hewitt.  Deloitte LLP 
also supplied market data, advice on market practice and governance, 
performance analysis and advice on plan design and performance 
measures.  Deloitte is also the company auditor and its advice in relation to 
remuneration has been provided in compliance with the terms of reference 
of the Audit Committee and the Ethical Standards of the Auditing Practices 
Board. 
 
Overview of Remuneration Philosophy 
 
Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors 
The Remuneration Committee again reviewed remuneration and reward 
arrangements for the company's executive directors in 2010.  Consistent 
with the policies of the Combined Code, the company's policy for directors' 
remuneration is that packages are intended to attract, motivate and retain 
directors of the highest calibre.  To maximise the effectiveness of the 
remuneration policy, careful consideration is given to aligning the 
remuneration package with shareholder interests and best practice. 
 
The aim is to target an appropriate level of remuneration in order to achieve 
the company's growth program but not detract from the goals of good 
corporate governance.   
 
In setting total remuneration, the Remuneration Committee considers a 
relevant group of comparators, selected on the basis of the role being 
considered.  In 2010 the relevant reference point was deemed to be the 
broader FTSE 100 and practice amongst international sectoral peers.  The 
FTSE 100 has been chosen as most relevant given the relative lack of 
comparable technology companies in the UK.  As a result any benchmark 
of other companies would be overwhelmingly dominated by foreign 
companies who do not operate under similar corporate governance 
guidelines.  Thus the main broad index of which the company is a member 
has been deemed the most relevant reference point.   
 
Historically and on a go-forward basis a high proportion of total 
remuneration has been and will be awarded through short term and long 
term performance related remuneration.  The Remuneration Committee 
believes that incorporating and setting appropriate performance measures 
and targets in the package is paramount; this will be reflected in an 
appropriate balance of operational and equity performance.  We believe 
that shareholders support the concept of paying outstanding rewards for 
outstanding performance.  We therefore have designed performance-
related schemes that offer executives the opportunity to earn significant 
remuneration if they produce large increases in long-term shareholder 
value.  Concomitantly, they should not receive significant performance 
rewards if performance is mediocre. 
 
This year as in the past remuneration and employment conditions 
elsewhere within the company are taken into account when determining 
executive compensation.  The company's highest paid employee earns a 
base salary approximately 5.5 times the base salary of the average 
employee.  Raises in 2010 generally match increases of compensation 
throughout the key positions in the group.  Executives are not offered 
special contracts or unique benefits; all benefits for executive directors are 
the same as those generally available to others in the company (such as 
matching pension contribution limited to 3% of base salary). 
 
Applicability 
The remuneration policy applies to executive directors.   
 
Compliance 
The Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008.  It also describes how the 
principles set out in the Combined Code have been applied in relation to 
the remuneration for the current and forthcoming financial years.  Deloitte 
LLP has audited the contents of the report to the extent required by the 
Companies Act. 
 
Changes for 2011 
For convenience, the table below sets out a summary of changes to the 
individual elements of the remuneration packages which will be effective for 
2011 for executive directors, discussed in more detail below.   
 
Element Changes for 2011 
Base salary ......................... No change to the benchmarking policy 
Benefits ............................... No new benefits 
Pensions ............................. No change to 3% capped matching pension 
Annual Cash Bonus ............ No change to maximum bonus, but addition 
of new non-financial performance target 
Deferred Bonus................... No change to maximum bonus, but addition 
of new non-financial performance target 
Deferred Shares Bonus ...... No change to maximum bonus

Autonomy Corporation plc     Annual Report and Accounts 2010     37  
Remuneration Elements 
The main elements of executive remuneration packages historically and for 
the expected future are: 
 
Base Salary 
The Remuneration Committee considers the level of base salary for each 
executive director annually, taking into account the performance of the 
individual and the company's strategies.  The Remuneration Committee 
also takes into account salaries in relevant comparable companies, specific 
factors relating to the individual, internal relatives and overall affordability.  
The appropriate market rate is the rate in the market place from which the 
individual is most likely to be recruited.   
 
In establishing individual salary levels, the Remuneration Committee is 
conscious that it should pay no more than is necessary to retain and 
motivate the executive, while ensuring business objectives are fulfilled.  
There is no automatic adjustment in respect of inflation.  Executive 
directors' base salaries remain low relative to similarly situated companies, 
with performance-based incentive compensation forming the most 
important factor in overall compensation.   
 
2010 salaries and benefits for the CEO and CFO were approved by the 
Board in early 2010 based on performance during 2010, which included 
record operating profits (adj.) up 14% from the prior year, and the fact that 
executive director compensation was amongst the lowest of similarly sized 
companies despite extraordinary performance.   
 
Given the company's significant growth, continued performance in 2010 
against strong comparators from the prior year, market positioning against 
UK and US comparators, the lack of generous pension entitlements and 
increase in size of roles, base salary raises for 2011 were approved as 
follows: 
 
 Salary for 2011 Raise 
Dr. Michael Lynch .............................  377,685 10% 
Sushovan Hussain ............................  339,916 10% 
 
The executive directors' base salaries remain in the bottom quartile of 
comparable companies.  Increases were generally in line with overall 
compensation increases throughout the group. 
 
Benefits 
Limited employment-related benefits are provided, consisting only of 
company car or car allowance and basic private medical insurance.  
Remuneration relatively common amongst peers which is not provided 
includes:  final salary pensions; executive director-specific pensions; tax 
advice; premium private health care; exit packages other than standard 
notice periods; guaranteed bonuses; or director-specific equity plans.   
 
Pensions 
During 2006 the company established a matching pension scheme 
available to all UK employees with more than three years' service.  The 
scheme provides for the company to make a matching contribution to an 
individual employee's pension, up to 3% of the individual's base salary 
(only) per annum.  Other than this generally available benefit, the directors 
do not have pension, retirement or similar entitlements. 
 
Bonuses 
In accordance with common practice amongst the company's peers, the 
company has performance-related bonus remuneration for certain 
executive directors.  Bonuses are intended to encourage the achievement 
of pre-defined annual financial objectives and to focus on the most 
important measures of business success, while rewarding individuals for 
outstanding performance.  In this way executive bonuses seek to align the 
interests of shareholders and those eligible. 
 
Generally, the outside world places great weight on the performance of the 
company from year to year, and we therefore think it appropriate to have a 
significant part of the performance pay linked to annual performance.  The 
purpose of the Cash Bonus and the Deferred Bonus schemes are to align 
Executive Directors with this performance period and to motivate them to 
meet and beat demanding annual performance targets. 
 
The targets for the annual element of bonuses are related to the goals of 
the company set by the Board.  Generally, bonuses will start to be earned 
at performance levels on target and then increase until they reach capped 
levels, which will generally be significantly above targets.   
 
Cash Bonus.  Executive directors are eligible for a bonus of 50% of base 
salary for basic achievement and up to an additional 50% of base salary for 
over performance against pre-agreed financial targets (awarded on a 
straight-line between the two targets).  The policy remains in place for 2011 
under the same guidelines, with the addition this year of a second non-
financial, strategic target to accompany the financial target. 
 
For 2010, the financial target for basic performance was 2010 earnings per 
share (adj. IFRS) of at least $1.20 per share, which was achieved resulting 
in a bonus of 50% of base salary for each of Dr. Lynch and Mr. Hussain.  
The over-performance target of $1.24 per share (adj. IFRS), resulting in an 
additional bonus of up to 50% of base salary, was not achieved.  The 
targets were selected as objective, challenging growth targets designed to 
meet the growth objectives of the company in line with company and 
shareholder expectations.  In selecting the targets and levels of 
compensation the committee reviewed the plans of similarly situated 
technology companies and analyst consensus forecasts.   
 
Deferred Bonus.  For 2010, the Board adopted a new deferred bonus 
policy for executive directors.  The Board believes that share ownership by 
directors and staff aligns their personal interests with those of shareholders.  
The policy remains in place for 2011 under the same guidelines, with the 
addition this year of a second non-financial, strategic target to accompany 
the financial target. 
 
Under the policy executive directors are granted share options following 
achievement of pre- financial targets, with vesting over subsequent years.  
Executive directors are eligible for a single annual grant of up to 150,000 
share options if the performance levels are achieved.  Grants vest from the 
date of award over the subsequent three years, with the maximum number 
set as approximately one and a half times base salary based on a Black 
Scholes valuation. 
 
For 2010, the financial target for basic performance was 2010 earnings per 
share (adj. IFRS) of at least $1.20 per share, which was achieved resulting 
in the issuance of 75,000 share options for each of Dr. Lynch and Mr. 
Hussain.  These options vest over the next three years in equal instalments 
on the three month anniversary of the date of grant and have an exercise 
price of  16.00 (equal to the fair market value on the date of approval).  
The over-performance target of $1.24 per share (adj. IFRS), which would 
have resulted in an additional award of up to 75,000 share options, was not 
achieved.  The targets were selected as objective, challenging growth 
targets designed to meet the growth objectives of the company in line with 
company and shareholder expectations.  In selecting the targets and levels 
of compensation the committee reviewed the plans of similarly situated 
technology companies and analyst consensus forecasts.   
   
Remuneration Report 
 
 
 
38     Autonomy Corporation plc     Annual Report and Accounts 2010 
Neither Dr. Lynch nor Mr. Hussain received any other share options in 2010 
related to performance during the year (the sole grant to Mr. Hussain in 
2010 related to 2009 performance prior to adoption of the 2010 policy).   
 
The Board sets reasonable individual grant limits for all employee share 
options across the entire Company.  As a result, at 31 December 2010, the 
Board collectively held options over less than 0.26% of outstanding equity, 
and options granted to the Board totalled 0.02% of the company's 
outstanding shares at 31 December 2010.  Options granted to Board 
members during 2010 totalled 0.65% of all share options outstanding at 
31 December 2010. 
 
Share options are always issued at market value.  The maximum number of 
share options the company is permitted to grant is up to 10% of the 
outstanding shares.  There has been no departure from this policy during 
2010. 
 
Deferred Shares Bonus.  In 2010 the Board approved a new performance 
share policy as part of the remuneration arrangements.  The policy remains 
in place for 2011 under the same guidelines. 
 
The purpose of the Deferred Shares Bonus is to align the interests of 
shareholders and management in growing the value of the business over 
the long term.  It does this by granting shares which vest depending on the 
extent to which the business meets targets over a three-year period; the 
value of the incentive to an executive is also heavily dependent on the level 
of share-price appreciation over the period, which also helps to align the 
interest of executive and shareholder.  A useful extra feature of the 
Deferred Shares Bonus is that it works as an extremely effective retention 
tool; the more successful the company is (and therefore the more attractive 
our executives are to other companies), the more difficult it becomes for 
other companies to lure our people away. 
 
The maximum annual award level for executive directors for 2010 and 2011 
is 100% of base salary.  Vesting of awards is based on meeting stretching 
performance targets over a three year performance period and, subject to 
meeting all relevant conditions, shares will normally be released to 
participants as soon as possible following the third anniversary of the 
award.  Any ordinary shares granted under the policy will be satisfied from 
the company's Employee Benefit Trust, thus will be non-dilutive to 
shareholders. 
 
Performance is measured against total shareholder return versus the 
constituents of the FTSE 100 at date of grant.  The FTSE 100 has been 
chosen as most relevant given the relative lack of comparable technology 
companies in the UK.  As a result any benchmark of other companies 
would be overwhelmingly dominated by foreign companies who do not 
operate under similar corporate governance guidelines.  Thus the main 
broad index of which the company is a member has been deemed the most 
relevant reference point.   
 
For 2011, 25% of an award will vest for performance equal to the 
FTSE 100's median performance three years hence.  100% of the award 
will vest for performance placing the company in the top 75th percentile of 
the FTSE 100's performance three years hence.  The award will vest on a 
straight line basis for performance in between the median and the top 
quartile.  No shares will vest for performance below the median.   
 
The first potential award was provisionally approved in 2010, and thus is 
still in the first year of its three year performance period. 
 
The Remuneration Committee will in all cases retain discretion to ensure 
that, as a condition for the vesting of shares, the underlying overall 
performance of the company has been satisfactory.  Vested awards will 
include adjustments for any dividends, share splits or similar corporate 
actions throughout the vesting period.   
 
If a participant resigns or is dismissed before shares are released, they will 
be forfeited.  The Remuneration Committee will have discretion to 
accelerate vesting in compassionate circumstances.  In the event of a 
change of control during the performance period, performance will be 
measured at the latest possible date before the change of control to assess 
the proportion vesting based on performance.  The proportion of the award 
that may be released will then be time prorated.  The Remuneration 
Committee will have discretion to disapply the impact of time pro rating and 
to permit up to 100% of awards to vest on a change of control if, due to 
exceptional business circumstances, returns to shareholders are 
considered to be at a superior level.   
 
Non-Executive Director Remuneration 
Fees for non-executive directors are determined taking into account 
expected time commitments and responsibilities, together with comparative 
market rates and benchmarking data.   
 
Non-executive directors are entitled to basic fees only.  For 2010 basic fees 
were set at  60,000 per annum for all non-executive directors, where they 
will remain for 2011.  An additional fee of  20,000 is to be paid to the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee.  The Chairman of the Board earned a 
fee of  120,000 per annum in 2010, which will remain the same in 2011. 
 
Non-executive directors do not participate in any bonus or performance-
related plans or any of the group's share incentive, option or pension 
schemes. 
 
Staff Incentive Schemes 
Options form the core element of the company's equity program for the 
broader employee base, and are granted in small amounts from time-to-
time to a very broad set of the company's employees after achievement of 
stretching performance targets and significant continuing contribution to 
value creation.  After grant share option awards are then subject to vesting 
periods, with initial vesting after six or 12 months with the remainder vesting 
over a total of 2.5 to 3.5 years.  Executive Directors participated in this 
scheme in prior years but no longer do so. 
 
The requirement for individuals to perform prior to granting options has 
been very effective in motivating performance, achieving targets and (most 
importantly) minimizing reward unconnected to an individual's performance.  
It enables the company to specifically tailor grants to an individual's role in 
an efficient manner.  This method also keeps individuals continuously 
incentivized as a grantee must remain employed to achieve full vesting of 
the options.  This method is also designed to ensure that individuals are not 
unjustly rewarded, which the Board believes is much more likely if large 
option grants are made with broad performance targets.  Under that 
method, an individual who was personally underperforming would 
undoubtedly be enriched if the company met its own broader performance 
targets, without making any material contribution, particularly given the 
company's rapid growth and share price appreciation.

Service Contracts 
 
Policy 
The Combined Code and guidelines issued by institutional investors 
recommend that notice periods of no more than one year be set as an 
objective for executive directors and that any payments to a departing 
executive director should be determined having full regard to the duty of 
mitigation.  The company has achieved these objectives in all respects.   
 
The company's policies prohibit long-fixed contracts and contractual 
termination payments.  The company requires mutual notice periods for 
directors, but never in excess of 12 months.  All executive directors have 
service contracts and all non-executive directors have appointment letters.  
All agreements provide for notice of 12 months or less, although do not 
have a specified fixed term, and all permit garden leave up to the length of 
the notice period.  No other amounts are payable on termination.  All terms 
of appointment are subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 
and the requirement to retire by rotation on the third anniversary of the 
previous election. 
 
Details of all directors' service contracts and appointment letters are 
available on the company's website.   
 
Executive Directors' Contracts 
No director is entitled to any automatic payment by virtue of early 
termination of their contract or a change in control of the company.  Details 
of executive directors' service contracts as at the date of this report are as 
follows: 
 
 
Date 
Mutual Notice 
Period 
Dr. Michael Lynch ............................. 9 July 1998 6 months 
Sushovan Hussain ............................ 27 June 2001 12 months 
 
Each executive director is entitled to current benefits generally made 
available to all employees and any fees or remuneration he is entitled to as 
a director of Autonomy.  Payment of salary in lieu of notice is permitted on 
termination.  For a fixed period following the termination of employment, 
each of Dr. Lynch and Mr. Hussain are prohibited from soliciting the 
company's clients, customers and employees and from competing with the 
company in a similar geographic area. 
 
Non-Executive Directors' Contracts 
The non-executive directors serve under appointment letters with the 
company.  All non-executive directors (including the Chairman) are 
appointed under the company's Articles of Association, which require that 
one third of all directors (including executive directors) shall retire at each 
AGM but that all directors must seek re-election at least every three years.  
They are also subject to review by the Nominating Committee prior to being 
considered for election or re-election by shareholders. 
 
Details of non-executive directors' appointment letters as at the date of this 
report are as follows: 
 
 Date 
Robert Webb, Chairman ................................................. 1 May 2009 
Jonathan Bloomer........................................................... 1 Aug 2010 
Richard Gaunt
(1)
.............................................................. 9 July 1998 
Frank Kelly...................................................................... 1 May 2010 
John McMonigall............................................................. 2 July 1998 
         
(1) Mr. Gaunt commenced service as a non-executive director in 2006. 
 
Either party may terminate the appointment upon three months' notice or 
payment of salary in lieu of notice.   
 
Non-executive directors are entitled to be reimbursed for their reasonable 
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending Board meetings and 
committees thereof.  No directors are entitled to reimbursement of non-
business expenses, and all directors are subject to the company's global 
expense policies. 
 
Other Considerations 
 
External Directorships 
Executive directors may hold positions in other companies as non-
executive directors.  In 2010, Dr. Lynch was the only executive director with 
such a position.  In connection with his services as a non-executive director 
of the BBC and blinkx Plc, during the year ended 31 December 2010 
Dr. Lynch received total remuneration of  35,000 and  35,000 
(2009:  35,000 and  35,000) from the BBC and blinkx, respectively.  
Dr. Lynch performs these services independently of his duties to the 
company and thus is entitled to receive such compensation.  Mr. Hussain 
commenced service as a non-executive director of Monetise Plc on 1 
January 2011 and will also retain any compensation he may receive.

(1) Vesting schedule is either subject to performance vesting, or over a period of three or four years with the first instalment exercisable after a cliff  of either six months or 
one year.  After the initial tranche vesting, additional tranches vest in equal quarterly instalments over the remainder of the vesting period.   
(2) First Exercise  represents the date of the vesting of the initial tranche when an initial portion of the options become available for exercise. 
(3) Granted as a bonus following achievement of pre-determined acquisition integration targets. 
(4) The gain made on exercise of share options during the year was  552,848, net of tax and the employer's portion of National Insurance contributions which are paid by 
the employee (gross:   1,298,386) (2009:  777,304, net ( 1,204,753, gross)). 
 
 
 
No non-executive directors hold share options, and the Board does not 
intend to grant any such options.  The option grants to executive directors 
made under prior Board policies remain available for exercise and vesting 
in accordance with the rules of the relevant grants.  They were subject to 
performance conditions prior to grant and vest over a three year period 
from grant.   
 
Options granted to ordinary employees in the company are on the same 
terms and at an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of 
grant.  The fair market value of the company's ordinary shares as quoted 
on the London Stock Exchange on 31 December 2010 (the last trading day 
of the year) was  15.05 per ordinary share, and the range during the year 
ended 31 December 2010 was from  12.71 to  19.75. 
 
Directors' Interests in Contracts 
None of the current directors had a material interest in any contract of 
significance to which the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings was 
a party during the financial year. 
 
Directors and their Interests

connected persons in the ordinary shares of the company at the start and
