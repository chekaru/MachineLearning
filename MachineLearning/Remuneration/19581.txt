General policy
The remuneration of the executive directors is determined by the Remuneration Committee (the Committee ) in accordance with the remuneration 
policy set by the Board upon recommendation from the Committee. The Committee, which consists solely of the non-executive directors of the 
Company (whose biographical details are given on page 10), determines the detailed terms of service of the executive directors, including basic salary, 
incentives and benefits and the terms upon which their service may be terminated. Non-executive directors have no personal financial interest in the 
Company, except the holding of shares, no potential conflict of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in the running 
of the Company. Details of their shareholdings are given on page 13.
Avacta's remuneration policy for executive directors is designed to attract, retain and motivate executives of the highest calibre to ensure the Group is 
managed successfully to the benefit of shareholders. The policy is to pay base salary at median levels with a performance related bonus each year. 
Share ownership is encouraged and all of the executive directors are interested in the share capital or share options over the share capital of the 
Company. In setting remuneration levels the Committee takes into consideration remuneration within the Group and the remuneration practices in 
other companies of a similar size in the markets and locations in which the Group operates. Avacta is a dynamic, growing Group which operates in a 
specialised field and positions are benchmarked against comparable roles in AIM companies. AIM is considered to be the most appropriate market 
against which to benchmark executive pay given the business strategy of the Group.
Executive Directors - Short-term incentives
Basic salary
Basic salary is based on a number of factors including market rates together with the individual director's experience, responsibilities and performance. 
Individual salaries of directors are subject to review annually on 1 April.
Performance related bonus
The Group operates an annual performance related bonus scheme for executive directors. The bonus scheme is discretionary dependent entirely upon 
the performance of the Group. Bonuses awarded for the performance of the Group for this financial year are set out below. 
Benefits in kind
The Group does not provide any benefits in kind to its directors. 
Pensions
The Group does not make payments into any post retirement benefit plans on behalf of its directors.
Executive Directors - Long-term incentives
Share interests
The Committee considers that the long-term motivation of the executive directors is secured by their interests in the share capital of the Company. 
The interests of the directors in the share capital of the Company are set out on page 13 and their interests in options held over shares in the Company 
are set out on page 16. 
Share retention
The directors have each undertaken to the Company that they will not dispose of any interest in the share capital of the Company before the first 
anniversary of Admission and that for a further period of 12 months, only to dispose of any such interest with the consent of the Company's broker. These 
undertakings do not apply in certain specified circumstances where directors find themselves in a difficult financial situation not within their own control.
Executive Directors' service agreements
The Board's policy on setting notice periods for directors is that these should not exceed one year.
The details of the service contracts of the executive directors are shown below.

Non-executive Directors
The Board determines the fees paid to non-executive directors, the aggregate limit for which is laid down in the Articles of Association. The fees, which 
are reviewed annually, are set in line with prevailing market conditions and at a level which will attract individuals with the necessary experience and ability 
to make a significant contribution to the Group's affairs. Non-executive directors are not involved in any discussion or decision about their own remuneration. 
The same applies to the Chairman of the Board whose remuneration is determined by the Board on the recommendation of the Committee.
Directors' Remuneration Report page 16 Avacta Group plc  Report and Accounts
The non-executive directors do not participate in any of the Group's pension schemes or bonus arrangements nor do they have service agreements. 
They were all appointed for an initial term of one year by letter of appointment dated 13 July 2006 and are entitled to three months' notice following 
that initial term. 
External appointments
The Committee recognises that its directors may be invited to become executive or non-executive directors of other companies or to become involved 
in charitable or public service organisations. As the Committee believes that this can broaden the knowledge and experience of the Company's 
directors to the benefit of the Group, it is the Company's policy to approve such appointments provided there is no conflict of interest and the 
commitment required is not excessive. The director concerned can retain the fees relating to any such appointment.
Total remuneration
The remuneration of each of the directors of the Company for the year ended 31 July 2007 is set out below.
