 12   Annual Report and Accounts 2011
General policy
The remuneration of the executive directors is determined by the Remuneration Committee (the Committee ) in accordance 
with the remuneration policy set by the Board upon recommendation from the Committee.  The Committee, which consists 
solely of the non-executive directors of the Company (whose biographical details are given on pages 6 and 7), determines the 
detailed terms of service of the executive directors, including basic salary, incentives and benefits and the terms upon which 
their service may be terminated.  Non-executive directors have no personal financial interest in the Company, except the 
holding of shares, no potential conflict of interest arising from cross directorships and no day-today involvement in the running 
of the Company.  Details of their shareholdings are given on page 9.
Avacta's remuneration policy for executive directors is designed to attract, retain and motivate executives of the highest calibre 
to ensure the Group is managed successfully to the benefit of shareholders.  The policy is to pay base salary at median levels 
with a performance related bonus each year.  Share ownership is encouraged and all of the executive directors are interested 
in the share capital and share options over the share capital of the Company.  In setting remuneration levels the Committee 
takes into consideration remuneration within the Group and the remuneration practices in other companies of a similar size in 
the markets and locations in which Avacta operates.  Avacta is a dynamic, growing company which operates in a specialised 
field and positions are benchmarked against comparable roles in AIM companies.  AIM is considered to be the most 
appropriate market against which to benchmark executive pay given the business strategy of Avacta.
Executive Directors - Short term incentives
Basic salary
Basic salary is based on a number of factors including market rates together with the individual director's experience, 
responsibilities and performance.  Individual salaries of directors are subject to review annually on 1 April.

discretionary dependent entirely upon the performance of the Group.  Bonuses awarded for the performance of the Group for 
this financial year are set out below. 
Benefits in kind
The Company does not provide any benefits in kind to its directors.  
Pensions
The Company makes payments into defined contribution Personal Pension Plans (the Plans ) on behalf of the executive

Executive Directors - Long term incentives
Share interests
The Committee considers that the long term motivation of the executive directors is secured by their interests in the share 
capital of the Company.  The interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company are set out on page 7 and their 
interests in options held over shares in the Company are set out on page 14. 
Executive Directors' service agreements
The Board's policy on setting notice periods for directors is that these should not exceed one year.  All directors have service 
agreements for a fixed period of one year, terminable on six months notice.
The details of the service contracts of the executive directors are shown below.

Non-executive directors
The Board determines the fees paid to non-executive directors, the aggregate limit for which is laid down in the Articles of 
Association.  The fees, which are reviewed annually, are set in line with prevailing market conditions and at a level which will 
attract individuals with the necessary experience and ability to make a significant contribution to the Group's affairs.  Non-
executive directors are not involved in any discussion or decision about their own remuneration.  The same applies to the 
Chairman of the Board whose remuneration is determined by the Board on the recommendation of the Committee.
The non-executive directors do not participate in any of the Company's pension schemes or bonus arrangements nor do they 
have service agreements.  Gwyn Humphreys, Tony Robards and Alan Aubrey were all appointed for an initial term of one year 
by letter of appointment dated 13 July 2006 and are entitled to three months' notice following that initial term.  
External appointments
The Committee recognises that its Directors may be invited to become executive or non-executive directors of other 
companies or to become involved in charitable or public service organisations.  As the Committee believes that this can 
broaden the knowledge and experience of the Company's Directors to the benefit of the Group, it is the Company's policy 
to approve such appointments provided there is no conflict of interest and the commitment required is not excessive.  The 
Director concerned can retain the fees relating to any such appointment. 14   Annual Report and Accounts 2011
