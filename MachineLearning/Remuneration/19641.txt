Avacta Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
General policy
The remuneration of the executive directors is determined 
by the Remuneration Committee (the Committee ) in 
accordance with the remuneration policy set by the 
Board upon recommendation from the Committee.  The 
Committee, which consists solely of the non-executive 
directors of the Company (whose biographical details are 
given on page 3), determines the detailed terms of service 
of the executive directors, including basic salary, incentives 
and benefits and the terms upon which their service may 
be terminated.  Non-executive directors have no personal 
financial interest in the Company, except the holding of 
shares, no potential conflict of interest arising from cross 
directorships and no day-to-day involvement in the running 
of the Company.  Details of the Directors' individual and 
joint (where applicable) shareholdings are given on page 9.
Avacta's remuneration policy for executive directors is 
designed to attract, retain and motivate executives of 
the highest calibre to ensure the Group is managed 
successfully to the benefit of shareholders.  The policy is 
to pay base salary at median levels with a performance 
related bonus each year.  Share ownership is encouraged 
and all of the executive directors are interested in the 
share capital or share options over the share capital of the 
Company.  In setting remuneration levels the Committee 
takes into consideration remuneration within the Group 
and the remuneration practices in other companies of a 
similar size in the markets and locations in which Avacta 
operates.  Avacta is a dynamic, growing company 
which operates in a specialised field and positions are 
benchmarked against comparable roles in AIM companies.  
AIM is considered to be the most appropriate market 
against which to benchmark executive pay given the 
business strategy of Avacta.
Executive Directors - Short term 
incentives
Basic salary
Basic salary is based on a number of factors including 
market rates together with the individual director's 
experience, responsibilities and performance.  Individual 
salaries of directors are subject to review annually on 1 
November.
Performance related bonus
The Company operates an annual performance related 
bonus scheme for executive directors.  The bonus scheme 
is discretionary dependent entirely upon the performance 
of the Group.  Bonuses awarded for the performance of 
the Group for this financial year are set out below. 
Benefits in kind
The Company does not provide any benefits in kind to its 
directors.  
Pensions
The Company makes payments into defined contribution 
Personal Pension Plans on behalf of the executive directors 
(with the exception of the Chief Financial Officer as set out 
on page 13).  These payments are at a rate of 5% of basic 
salary.
Executive Directors - Long term 
incentives
Share interests
The Committee considers that the long term motivation 
of the executive directors is secured by their interests in 
the share capital of the Company.  The individual interests 
and joint interests (where applicable) of the Directors in the 
share capital of the Company are set out on page 9 and 
their interests in options held over shares in the Company 
are set out on page 14.  
Executive Directors' service agreements
The Board's policy on setting notice periods for directors 
is that these should not exceed one year.  All directors 
have service agreements for a fixed period of one year, 
terminable on six months notice.
The details of the service contracts of the executive 
directors are shown opposite.

Non-executive directors
The Board determines the fees paid to non-executive 
directors, the aggregate limit for which is laid down in 
the Articles of Association.  The fees, which are reviewed 
annually, are set in line with prevailing market conditions 
and at a level which will attract individuals with the 
necessary experience and ability to make a significant 
contribution to the Group's affairs.  Non-executive directors 
are not involved in any discussion or decision about their 
own remuneration.  The same applies to the Chairman of 
the Board whose remuneration is determined by the Board 
on the recommendation of the Committee.
The non-executive directors do not participate in any of the 
Company's pension schemes or bonus arrangements nor 
do they have service agreements.  Gwyn Humphreys, Tony 
Robards and Alan Aubrey were all appointed for an initial 
term of one year by letter of appointment dated 13 July 
2006 and are entitled to three months' notice following that 
initial term.   
External appointments
The Committee recognises that its Directors may be invited 
to become executive or non-executive directors of other 
companies or to become involved in charitable or public 
service organisations.  As the Committee believes that 
this can broaden the knowledge and experience of the 
Company's Directors to the benefit of the Group, it is the 
Company's policy to approve such appointments provided 
there is no conflict of interest and the commitment required 
is not excessive.  The Director concerned can retain the 
fees relating to any such appointment.
