 General policy
The remuneration of the executive directors is determined
by the Remuneration Committee (the Committee ) in
accordance with the remuneration policy set by the Board
upon recommendation from the Committee.  The
Committee, which consists solely of the non-executive
directors of the Company (whose biographical details are
given on page 4), determines the detailed terms of service
of the executive directors, including basic salary, incentives
and benefits and the terms upon which their service may
be terminated.  Non-executive directors have no personal
financial interest in the Company, except the holding of
shares, no potential conflict of interest arising from cross
directorships and no day-today involvement in the running
of the Company.  Details of the Directors individual and
joint (where applicable) shareholdings are given on page 8.
Avacta's remuneration policy for executive directors is
designed to attract, retain and motivate executives of the
highest calibre to ensure the Group is managed
successfully to the benefit of shareholders.  The policy is to
pay base salary at median levels with a performance
related bonus each year.  Share ownership is encouraged
and all of the executive directors are interested in the share
capital or share options over the share capital of the
Company.  In setting remuneration levels the Committee
takes into consideration remuneration within the Group and
the remuneration practices in other companies of a similar
size in the markets and locations in which Avacta operates.
Avacta is a dynamic, growing company which operates in
a specialised field and positions are benchmarked against
comparable roles in AIM companies.  AIM is considered to
be the most appropriate market against which to
benchmark executive pay given the business strategy of
Avacta.
Executive Directors 
- Short term incentives
Basic salary
Basic salary is based on a number of factors including
market rates together with the individual director's
experience, responsibilities and performance.  Individual
salaries of directors are subject to review annually on 1
November.
Performance related bonus
The Company operates an annual performance related
bonus scheme for executive directors.  The bonus scheme
is discretionary dependent entirely upon the performance
of the Group.  Bonuses awarded for the performance of
the Group for this financial year are set out below. 
Benefits in kind
The Company does not provide any benefits in kind to its
directors.  
Pensions
The Company makes payments into defined contribution
Personal Pension Plans (the Plans ) on behalf of the
executive directors.  These payments are at a rate of 5% of
basic salary.
Executive Directors 
- Long term incentives
Share interests
The Committee considers that the long term motivation of
the executive directors is secured by their interests in the
share capital of the Company.  The individual interests and
joint interests (where applicable) of the Directors in the
share capital of the Company are set out on page 8 and
their interests in options held over shares in the Company
are set out on page 13. 
Executive Directors' service agreements
The Board's policy on setting notice periods for directors is
that these should not exceed one year.  All executive
directors have service agreements terminable on six
months notice.
The details of the service contracts of the executive
directors are shown below.

Non-executive directors
The Board determines the fees paid to non-executive
directors, the aggregate limit for which is laid down in the
Articles of Association.  The fees, which are reviewed
annually, are set in line with prevailing market conditions
and at a level which will attract individuals with the
necessary experience and ability to make a significant
contribution to the Group's affairs.  Non-executive directors
are not involved in any discussion or decision about their
own remuneration.  The same applies to the Chairman of
the Board whose remuneration is determined by the Board
on the recommendation of the Committee.
The non-executive directors do not participate in any of the
Company's pension schemes or bonus arrangements nor
do they have service agreements.  Gwyn Humphreys, Tony
Robards and Alan Aubrey were all appointed for an initial
term of one year by letter of appointment dated 13 July
2006 and are entitled to three months' notice following that
initial term.  Trevor Nicholls was appointed on 2 August
2013 with no initial term and is entitled to one months'
notice.
External appointments
The Committee recognises that its Directors may be invited
to become executive or non-executive directors of other
companies or to become involved in charitable or public
service organisations.  As the Committee believes that this
can broaden the knowledge and experience of the
Company's Directors to the benefit of the Group, it is the
Company's policy to approve such appointments provided
there is no conflict of interest and the commitment required
is not excessive.  The Director concerned can retain the
fees relating to any such appointment.

for the year ended 31 July 2013 is set out below.
The above emoluments include all payments paid to the directors whilst directors of the Group.
