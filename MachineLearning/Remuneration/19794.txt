The Remuneration Committee comprises Independent Non Executive Directors only. The Remuneration Committee, on behalf of the 
Board, meets as and when necessary to review and approve, as appropriate, the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior 
management and major remuneration plans for the Group.
The Chairmanship was held by Alan Foster until February 2013, when it was assumed by Richard Vos. The Committee would like to thank 
Alan Foster for his major contribution during the Company's early development stages.
During the year the Remuneration Committee met six times.
Remuneration policy
The Company's policy on remuneration of Directors is to attract, retain and motivate the best people, recognising the input they have to 
the ongoing success of the business. Consistent with this policy, the remuneration and benefits package awarded to Directors is intended 
to be competitive and comprises a mix of performance related and non performance related elements designed to incentivise Directors 
in the short and longer term, and align their interests with those of shareholders. Their remuneration accordingly consists of base pay, 
annual bonus, long term incentive plan, share options, pension contributions and other benefits such as health care.
The Long Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP') in operation since 2006 terminated on 30 June 2013. The Remuneration Committee accordingly 
developed, with advice from Deloitte Touche Tomatsu (Deloitte), a new LTIP that would come into operation from July 2013. Under the 
new LTIP, shares will only vest if specific targets are met that will reflect the desired performance of the Company as it develops from 
a  start up' to a more mature business.
Other than the new LTIP, the above represents no change from the Company's remuneration policy and no further change is anticipated 
in the coming year.

Long Term Incentive Plans ( LTIPs')
LTIPs have been established by the Company with approval of the Remuneration Committee to reward and incentivise the Executive Directors and 
senior managers of the Company. The LTIP in force during 2013 was established in 2006 with a final maturity date of 30 June 2013. Accordingly, 
the Remuneration Committee has developed, with the advice and assistance of Deloitte, a new LTIP which will replace the 2006-2013 LTIP .
All unvested shares are held in the Employee Benefit trust ( EBT'). The LTIP allocations are in separate sub funds within the EBT and are 
subject to automatic revocation if certain criteria are not met and continue to be revocable for the entire Trust period.
The allocations into the LTIP vary for each executive. 
2006-2013 LTIP
The total allocation to the executive was split into three separate Tranches:
The Core Tranche
This element of the grant became exercisable in seven equal instalments. The first instalment was exercisable on grant, the second 
on 30 June 2008 and the remaining five annually thereafter. 
The Exceptional Achievement Tranche
This tranche vested in 2012.
The Extraordinary Achievement Tranche
This element of the grant was only exercisable if the market value of a share exceeded  10 for a consecutive period of 6 months before 
June 2013. As this condition was not met, the grant did not vest and the outstanding shares were returned to the EBT.

New LTIP 2013
Allocations to senior executives is subject to specific performance criteria, which must be met within a stated period after the grant. 
For the first year, the criteria are twofold:
Two thirds of an award ( the Revenue Part'), or a proportion thereof, will only vest if specific revenue targets are achieved or bettered. Revenue will 
be based on the Company's audited financial statements for the relevant financial year. The revenue part will lapse to the extent it does not vest.
One third of an award ( the Share Price Part'), or a proportion thereof, will vest if the three month average share price is above a specified 
amount. In the event of any variation in the share capital of the Company by way of capitalisation or rights issue, consolidation, subdivision or 
reduction or otherwise, the Remuneration Committee shall make an appropriate adjustment to the share price targets to reflect this.
The share price part will lapse to the extent it does not vest in accordance with the schedule.
