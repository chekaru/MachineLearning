DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
As an AIM listed company, the Company is not required to comply with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. Nevertheless, the Board prefers to follow
best practice and has therefore prepared the following report, which meets the majority of these regulations and which will be put to shareholders for approval at the
Annual General Meeting.
This part of the Directors' remuneration report is unaudited.
Remuneration committee
Prior to 17 May 2007, the Company did not have a separate remuneration committee in view of the then small size of the Board. On 17 May 2007, the date on which
the Company acquired Avesco plc, Mr Gibbins, Mr Murray, Mr Blackall and Mr Maxwell, who are all non executive Directors, were appointed to the remuneration
committee and have served throughout the remainder of the year. The remuneration committee has not sought professional advice from external consultants during
the year. However, the remuneration committee consults with the Chief Executive, as it considers appropriate, in relation to its proposals relating to the remuneration of
the executive Directors.
Remuneration policy
The remuneration committee makes recommendations to the Board on the executive remuneration policy and determines specific remuneration packages for each of
the executive Directors. The aim of the remuneration committee is to provide total remuneration packages which attract, retain and motivate executive Directors of the
appropriate calibre. The remuneration policy is to reward excellent performance, to be commercially competitive and to align the interests of employees with those of
shareholders to create value.
This report sets out the Company's policy on executive remuneration, its operation in the year and (although the remuneration committee is unable to confirm that the
policy will continue without amendment in future years) how it is intended to be operated going forwards. It is considered that a successful policy should retain
sufficient flexibility to allow account to be taken of future changes in the business environment and remuneration practice. The policy should also allow for any special
arrangements which may be necessary in the future in order to recruit a director of sufficient calibre. However, any changes in the policy for future years will be
described in future reports, which will be subject to shareholder approval.
The principal elements of the remuneration package are as follows:
Basic salary and benefits
The salary of each executive Director is reviewed annually having regard to his individual responsibilities and contribution and to ensure that it is competitive with
salaries of persons in equivalent positions in comparable companies. All executive Directors receive a Company car and fuel benefit (or an allowance in lieu) and are
entitled to pension contributions, medical insurance cover, life assurance cover and permanent health insurance cover.
Annual bonus
Each of the executive Directors is entitled to a non-pensionable annual bonus which is dependent upon the achievement of short-term corporate and personal
performance targets approved by the remuneration committee. The annual bonus may not exceed 100% of basic salary. In respect of each of the year ended
30 September 2007 and the year ending 30 September 2008, the annual bonus is based on a range of personal, divisional or Group performance targets, which will
differ between Directors according to their respective responsibilities and which will be measured against and conditional upon achievement of the Company's
internal budgets for the year.
Long term incentives
The Company operates an executive share option scheme (Option Scheme ), which was established in 1997, and a long term incentive plan (LTIP ), which was
established following the acquisition of Avesco plc in 2007 (see Note 24 in these Accounts for further details).
Under the Option Scheme, which is a HM Revenue and Customs unapproved scheme, the Company granted options to its then directors in respect of a total of
1,468,467 ordinary 10p shares. The options are exercisable at a price of 71.1667p per share between 24 February 2007 and 24 February 2011. The right to exercise
these options was subject to a performance condition that has now been satisfied. No further grants of options may be made under the Option Scheme.
Under the LTIP, awards are made to employees under which they can receive Avesco shares at no cost to themselves based on the achievement of a pre-determined
and stretching performance condition. It is intended that vested allocations will be satisfied in due course by delivery through an employee trust. No individual may
receive awards in any financial year with an aggregate value at the time of grant in excess of 100% of the employee's annual basic salary although this limit may
increase to 200% of the employee's basic annual salary if the remuneration committee decides that exceptional circumstances exist. No awards may be made under
the LTIP more than 10 years after its adoption.
The rules of the LTIP provide that in any 10 year period no more than 15% of Avesco's issued share capital from time to time may be issued or subject to an award or
option to be issued for the purposes of the LTIP or any other employees' share scheme. The 15% limit takes account of the fact that options have been granted under
the Option Scheme in respect of 5.65% of the issued share capital to persons who no longer perform an executive role in the Company. Accordingly, less than 10% of
the issued share capital is available for the issue of awards to executives under the LTIP.
The performance condition applicable to the first awards of 964,000 rights to shares made under the LTIP is that a cumulative adjusted earnings per share of at least
45p is achieved over the three years ending 30 September 2010. The remuneration committee has discretion to adjust the earnings per share in relation to
exceptional and/or non-recurring events. Subject to the rules of the LTIP and the fulfilment of the performance condition, 50 per cent of the shares will be released after
the preliminary announcement of the results of the Company for the year ending 30 September 2010 and, subject to continuing service of the award holder, the
remaining 50 per cent of the shares will be released on the first anniversary of that announcement date or, if later, the date of announcement by the Company of its
results for the period ending 30 September 2011.
It is intended that further awards will be made under the LTIP in the next 12 months subject to the rules of the LTIP and the fulfilment of similar performance and vesting
conditions as for the previous awards.
Pensions
Pension contributions relating to the executive Directors of the Company are paid to defined contribution arrangements and are calculated by reference to basic salary
only. Annual bonuses and other benefits are not pensionable.
Contracts
Except as noted below, the service contracts of the executive Directors are subject to a twelve months' notice period by either party. It is the policy of the remuneration
committee that the Company should not enter into contracts for any executive Director with rolling notice periods exceeding one year for any executive Director.
The contracts of the executive Directors provide that, in the event of their termination in certain circumstances in the 12 months following a change of control of the
Company, the Director shall be entitled to a severance payment not exceeding the sum of 24 months' emoluments less emoluments received since the change of
control. The severance payment is triggered only in the event of termination of the Director (other than for gross misconduct) by the Company or in the event of the
Company committing a material breach or making a material change to the Director's detriment in the terms and conditions of the Director's employment or assigning
to him duties inconsistent with the position held prior to the change of control. The remuneration committee consider such a provision appropriate in order to retain
the services of key executives in the event of a change of control occurring and in order to ensure an orderly transfer to an acquirer. AVESCO GROUP PLC

Non executive Directors
The remuneration of the non executive Directors is subject to a maximum aggregate limit agreed by the shareholders and set out in the articles of association.
Within this limit, the remuneration of the non executive Directors is determined by the Board as a whole although no non executive Director is present when his own
fees are under discussion. Mr Maxwell and Mr Murray each hold options under the Option Scheme granted to them at a time when they held executive office with
the Company. Subject to those grants, the non executive Directors do not participate in the share option schemes and do not receive any pension contributions or
other benefits.
Each of the non executive Directors has a service contract with the Company, which is capable of termination on not less than three months' notice.
