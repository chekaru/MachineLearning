This report has been prepared in compliance with the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and will be put to
shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The remuneration committee consists entirely of non-executive
Directors. At the beginning of the year the remuneration
committee comprised Mr Morton and Mr Stirling. Mr Morton
ceased to hold office on 6 September 2002 and Mr Martin was
appointed to the remuneration committee on 16 September
2002. The remuneration committee has not sought professional
advice from external consultants during the year. However, the
remuneration committee consults with the Chairman and the
Chief Executive, as it considers appropriate, in relation to its
proposals relating to the remuneration of the executive directors.
Remuneration Policy
The remuneration committee makes recommendations to the
Board on executive remuneration policy and on behalf of the
Board determines specific remuneration packages for each of
the executive directors. The aim of the remuneration committee
is to provide total remuneration packages which attract, retain
and motivate executive directors of the appropriate calibre. The
remuneration policy is to reward excellent performance, to be
commercially competitive and to align the interests of employees
with those of shareholders to create value.
This report sets out the Company's policy on executive
remuneration. Although the remuneration committee is able to
state the policy for the year ending 31 March 2004 with
reasonable certainty, it is unable to confirm that the policy will
continue without amendment in subsequent years. It is considered
that a successful policy should retain sufficient flexibility to allow
account to be taken of future changes in the business
environment and remuneration practice. The policy should also
allow for any special arrangements which may be necessary in the
future in order to recruit a director of sufficient calibre. However,
any changes in the policy for future years will be described in
future reports, which will be subject to shareholder approval.
The principal elements of the remuneration package are as
follows:
Basic salary and benefits
The salary of each executive director is reviewed annually having
regard to his individual responsibilities and contribution and to
ensure that it is competitive with salaries of persons in equivalent
positions in comparable companies. All executive directors receive
a Company car and fuel benefit (or an allowance in lieu) and are
entitled to pension contributions, medical insurance cover, life
assurance cover and permanent health insurance cover. 
Annual bonus
Each of the executive directors is entitled to an annual bonus
dependent upon the achievement of short-term corporate and
personal performance targets approved by the Remuneration
Committee. The annual bonus may not exceed 100% of basic
salary. Corporate performance is measured by reference to the
increase in an adjusted earnings per share over a 12 month
period and, where applicable, to the performance against
budget of the businesses for which the director concerned has
specific responsibility. 
Long-term incentives
The Company operates two executive share option schemes
established in 1994 and 1997, respectively. Options granted
under the 1994 scheme, which is an Inland Revenue approved
scheme, are exercisable only if, over a three year period, the
increase in the Company's share price exceeds the increase in the
Retail Prices Index over the same three year period. Options
under the 1997 scheme, which is not an Inland Revenue
approved scheme, are exercisable only if, over a three year
period, the growth in the Group's adjusted earnings per share
exceeds the increase in the Retail Prices Index over the same
three year period plus six per cent. 
Options are exercisable under the 1994 scheme between three
and ten years after the date of grant and under the 1997 scheme
between three and seven years after the date of grant. Options
are granted at the market price of the Company's shares at the
time of grant. The total value of options, calculated by reference
to the relevant option exercise price, outstanding at any time
together with those exercised or surrendered in the previous 10
years will not exceed four times the salary of the option holder.
Pensions
Pension contributions relating to the executive directors of the
Company (other than Mr Murray) are paid to defined
contribution arrangements and are calculated by reference to
basic salary only. Annual bonuses and other benefits are not
pensionable. The fees payable to Mr Murray include an amount
to enable him to make his own pension provision arrangements.
Contracts
The dates of the contracts of the executive directors are as
follows:
Executive directors Date
RA Murray 14.06.1996
DJ Nicholson 31.03.1995
GP Andrews 18.11.1994
DG Brocksom 15.10.1998
NS Conn 18.11.1994
DA Crump 21.10.1996
Except as noted below, the service contracts of the executive
directors are subject to a rolling twelve month notice period. It is
the policy of the remuneration committee that the Company
should not enter into contracts for any executive director with
rolling notice periods exceeding one year. 
The contracts of the executive directors provide that, in the event
of their termination in certain circumstances in the 24 months
following a change of control of the Company, the director shall
be entitled to a severance payment not exceeding the sum of 24
months' emoluments less emoluments received since the change
of control. The remuneration committee consider such a
provision appropriate in order to retain the services of key
executives.
Non-executive directors
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is subject to a
maximum aggregate limit agreed by the shareholders and set
out in the articles of association. Within this limit, the
remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by
the Board as a whole although no non executive Director is
present when his own fees are under discussion. The non-
executive directors do not participate in the share option
schemes and do not receive any pension contributions or other
benefits. 
Directors' remuneration report 21
Mr Martin has a service contract with the Company, which is
dated 16 September 2002 and is capable of termination on not
less than three months' notice expiring not earlier than
16 September 2003. Mr Maxwell and Mr Stirling do not have
written service contracts with the Company and are not
engaged for any defined term.

* The fees and salaries of those directors marked with an asterisk were paid to companies connected with the directors. 
  Mr Kossick and Mr Morton resigned from the Board on 30 August 2002 and 6 September 2002, respectively. Ian Martin was appointed to the Board
on 16 September 2002.
Each of the executive directors waived his entitlement to an annual pay review in the year, the increase in total emoluments in 2003 (other than for Mr
Kossick) resulting from changes in the Inland Revenue rates for the assessment of taxable benefits. The bonus paid to Mr Kossick related to compensation
for the additional work which he was required to carry out in connection with the disposal of Fountain Television. The bonus was paid partly in cash and
partly by the transfer by the Company of shares in the purchaser of Fountain Television. No other bonuses were paid to directors during the year. 
The Company made contributions to defined contribution pension arrangements in respect of six directors (2002: six directors).
