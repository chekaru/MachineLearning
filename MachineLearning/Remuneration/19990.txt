As an AIM listed company, the Company is
not required to comply with the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Nevertheless, the Board prefers to follow
best practice and has therefore prepared the
following report, which meets the majority
of these regulations and which will be put to
shareholders for approval at the Annual
General Meeting.
Remuneration Committee
The remuneration committee comprises Mr
Gibbins and Mr Murray, both non-executive
directors, who were appointed with effect
from 19 February 2004, following the
completion of the demerger of the Group
from the company previously known as
Avesco plc, which is now separately listed
on the Alternative Investment Market of the
London Stock Exchange as InvestinMedia
plc (Old Avesco ). Prior to 19 February
2004, the remuneration policy of the Group
was determined by the remuneration
committee of Old Avesco. The remuneration
committee has not sought professional
advice from external consultants during the
year. However, the remuneration committee
consults with the Chairman and the Chief
Executive, as it considers appropriate, in
relation to its proposals relating to the
remuneration of the executive directors.
Remuneration Policy
The remuneration committee makes
recommendations to the Board on the
executive remuneration policy and
determines specific remuneration packages
for each of the executive directors. The aim
of the remuneration committee is to provide
total remuneration packages which attract,
retain and motivate executive directors of
the appropriate calibre. The remuneration
policy is to reward excellent performance, to
be commercially competitive and to align
the interests of employees with those of
shareholders to create value.
This report sets out the Company's policy on
executive remuneration. Although the
remuneration committee is able to state the
policy for the year ending 31 March 2005
with reasonable certainty, it is unable to
confirm that the policy will continue without
amendment in subsequent years. It is
considered that a successful policy should
retain sufficient flexibility to allow account
to be taken of future changes in the business
environment and remuneration practice. The
policy should also allow for any special
arrangements which may be necessary in the
future in order to recruit a director of
sufficient calibre. However, any changes in
the policy for future years will be described
in future reports, which will be subject to
shareholder approval.
The principal elements of the remuneration
package are as follows:
Basic salary and benefits
The salary of each executive director is
reviewed annually having regard to his
individual responsibilities and contribution
and to ensure that it is competitive with
salaries of persons in equivalent positions in
comparable companies. All executive
directors are entitled to pension
contributions, medical insurance cover, life
assurance cover and permanent health
insurance cover, and, other than Mr Martin
receive a company car and fuel benefit (or
an allowance in lieu).
Annual bonus
Each of the executive directors is entitled to
an annual bonus dependent upon the
achievement of short-term corporate and
personal performance targets approved by
the remuneration committee. The annual
bonus may not exceed 100% of basic salary.
In respect of the year ending 31 March
2005, the total bonus pool will comprise
25% of the amount by which the adjusted
pre-tax profits of the Company exceed the
pre-tax profit equivalent of an adjusted
earnings per share of 5p. 50% of the total
bonus pool will be distributed among the
directors in defined proportions and the
remaining 50% will allocated at the
discretion of the remuneration committee.
Long-term incentives
The Company operates a long-term
incentive plan (LTIP ) and an executive
share option scheme, both established in
2004 and approved by the shareholders of
InvestinMedia plc as part of the
arrangements for the demerger. 
In any 10 year period no more than 10% of
Avesco's issued share capital from time to
time may be issued or put under option to be
issued for the purposes of the LTIP and the
share option scheme. No awards may be
made under either scheme more than 10
years after its adoption.
Under the LTIP, which is operated in
conjunction with an employee trust, awards
are made to employees under which they
can receive Avesco shares at no cost to
themselves based on the achievement of a
pre-determined and stretching performance
condition. No individual may receive awards
in any financial year with an aggregate value
at the time of grant in excess of 100% of the
employee's annual basic salary although this
limit may increase to 200% of the
employee's basic annual salary if the
remuneration committee decides that
exceptional circumstances exist.
The performance condition applicable to the
first award made under the LTIP is that a
cumulative adjusted earnings per share
(calculated in accordance with guidelines
issued by the Institute of Investment
Management and Research) of at least 20p is
achieved over the three years ending
31 March 2007. The remuneration
committee has discretion to adjust the
earnings per share in relation to exceptional
and/or non-recurring events. Subject to the
rules of the LTIP and the fulfilment of the
performance condition, 50% of the shares
will be released after the preliminary
announcement of the results of the Company
for the year ending 31 March 2007 and,
subject to continuing service of the award
holder, 50% of the shares will be released on
31 March 2008.
Directors' remuneration report 26
Under the Avesco plc 2004 share option
scheme, options may be granted over Avesco
shares to employees with an exercise price
equal to the market price on the day
immediately preceding the date of grant. The
share option scheme is divided into Parts A
and B, of which Part A has been approved
by the Inland Revenue. Under Part A of the
share option scheme, an option may not be
granted to an individual if it would cause the
total price of Avesco shares under
outstanding options to that individual to
exceed  30,000 or such higher limit as may
be imposed by legislation from time to time.
Under Part B, no individual may receive
awards in any financial year with an
aggregate value at the time of grant in
excess of 100% of the employee's annual
basic salary although this limit may increase
to 200% of the employee's basic annual
salary if the remuneration committee decides
that exceptional circumstances exist. The
exercise of options will be dependent on the
achievement of an appropriate performance
condition set by the remuneration committee
when the options are granted. Subject to the
rules of the share option scheme and the
achievement of the performance condition,
options are exercisable between three and
ten years after the date of grant. 
It is not currently proposed to use the option
scheme, which had been adopted in order to
give the Board maximum flexibility as to
how to make long term equity awards,
although the Board may decide to make
awards under it in due course
Pensions
Pension contributions relating to the
executive directors of the Company are paid
to defined contribution arrangements and are
calculated by reference to basic salary only.
Annual bonuses and other benefits are not
pensionable.
Contracts
Except as noted below, the service contracts
of the executive directors are subject to a
twelve months' notice period by either party.
It is the policy of the remuneration committee
that the Company should not enter into
contracts for any executive director with
rolling notice periods exceeding one year for
any executive director. 
The contracts of the executive directors
provide that, in the event of their
termination in certain circumstances in the
12 months following a change of control of
the Company, the director shall be entitled to
a severance payment not exceeding the sum
of 24 months' emoluments less emoluments
received since the change of control. The
severance payment is triggered only in the
event of termination of the director (other
than for gross misconduct) by the Company
or in the event of the Company committing
a material breach or making a material
change to the director's detriment in the
terms and conditions of the director's
employment or assigning to him duties
inconsistent with the position held prior to
the change of control. The remuneration
committee considers such a provision
appropriate in order to retain the services of
key executives in the event of a change of
control occurring and in order to ensure an
orderly transfer to an acquirer.
Non-executive directors
The remuneration of the non-executive
directors is subject to a maximum aggregate
limit agreed by the shareholders and set out
in the articles of association. Within this
limit, the remuneration of the non-executive
directors is determined by the Board as a
whole although no non-executive director is
present when his own fees are under
discussion. The non-executive directors do
not participate in the share option schemes
and do not receive any pension contributions
or other benefits. 
Mr Gibbins has a service contract with the
Company, which is capable of termination
on not less than three months' notice
expiring not earlier than 1 January 2005. Mr
Murray has a service contract with the
Company, which is capable of termination
on not less than three months' notice
expiring not earlier than 19 March 2005.
