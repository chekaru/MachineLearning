 DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
AVEVA Annual Report 2005 Directors' remuneration report 26
This report has been prepared in accordance with Section 234B of the Companies Act 1985. The report also meets the relevant requirements
of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating
to directors' remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting
of the company at which the financial statements of the company will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the company members on the  auditable part' of the Directors' remuneration report and to
state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended).
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee's principal responsibility is to determine the remuneration of both the company's executive directors and its
senior management within broad policies agreed with the board. In addition it reviews the remuneration policy for the company as a whole.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the executive directors, not the Committee.
The Committee comprises a chairman (David Mann) and two non-executive directors (Richard King and Colin Garrett). The chief executive
(Richard Longdon) is invited to submit recommendations to the Committee and both he and the members of the Committee take into
consideration relevant external market data as well as the reviews of remuneration for employees of the group generally.
REMUNERATION POLICY 
The Committee aims to ensure that members of the executive management are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced
performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the company. It also
aims for a combination of fixed and variable payments, benefit and share option plans that will achieve a balance in incentives to achieve
short and long-term goals.
BASIC SALARIES
In determining the basic salary of each executive director the Committee takes account of the performance of the company as a whole and
the performance of the individual in achieving financial and non-financial goals within his areas of responsibility.
BONUS PAYMENTS
The executive directors participate in annual performance-related bonus schemes determined by the Committee. The schemes are based
substantially or entirely on the performance of the company as a whole; part may be based on the achievement of personal objectives. 
Bonuses payable in the year to 31 March 2005 amounted to, Richard Longdon  132,000 and Paul Taylor  86,000. For the year ended 
31 March 2005 there was a cap on the bonus that an executive director could earn under the scheme and the maximum cap was 60% 
of basic salary. AVEVA Annual Report 2005 Directors' remuneration report 27
SHARE OPTIONS
The Committee considers that periodic grants of share-related incentives should constitute an important element of the remuneration of the
company's senior executives, in line with common practice in competitive companies. However there was very little scope for providing such
incentives via the company's existing share option scheme. Following discussions with and approval from shareholders at the Extraordinary
General Meeting held in May 2004, a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was established by the company in 2004 and the dilution limits under
the existing share option scheme were extended. 
During the year 12,000 and 9,000 share options under the LTIP were granted to Richard Longdon and Paul Taylor respectively. The options
were granted at a price equal to the nominal value of an ordinary share, which is 10p. The extent to which the options are exercisable will
depend on the ranking of the company in terms of total shareholder return measured against other companies in the London Stock Exchange
techMARK Index. The performance will be measured three years from the date of grant and there is no allowance for retesting. 
The options will vest in accordance with the following scale:
In determining the conditions of exercise for any future grants of options under the LTIP, the Remuneration Committee will take note of
practical experience, professional advice, market trends and investor guidelines.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
The service contracts and letters of appointment of the directors include the following terms:
The Committee considers that the notice periods of the executive directors are in line with those in other companies of a similar size 
and nature and are in the best interests of the group to ensure stability in senior management. The non-executive and executive directors
retire at any Annual General Meeting where they are so required by the Articles of Association, accordingly their contracts have no set
termination date. 
There are no predetermined special provisions for executive or non-executive directors with regard to compensation in the event of loss 
of office. The Remuneration Committee would be responsible for considering the circumstances of the early termination and in exceptional
circumstances will determine compensation payments in excess of the company's contractual obligations.

SHARE OPTIONS
The interests of directors in options to acquire ordinary shares were as follows:
The market price as at 31 March 2005 was 672.50p with a high-low spread for the year of 492.50p to 682.50p. 
The aggregate gain on exercise of options by directors for the year ended 31 March 2005 was  nil (2004 -  312,572).
The options are normally exercisable in full or in part between the third and seventh anniversaries of the date of grant. All options except
for those at 10p are subject to performance conditions, which require earnings per share to outperform RPI (utilisation) by a total of 10%
over a three year rolling period. The share option rules were established at the time of the company's initial public offering in 1996 and the
performance conditions set were commonly used at that time. The options granted during the year at 10p are part of the LTIP scheme and
are subject to performance criteria as set out on page 27. The market price at the date of grant was  5.49. The Board monitors whether the
performance conditions have been achieved on an annual basis using a formula which is set out within the rules.

PENSIONS
During the year, two directors, (Richard Longdon and Paul Taylor) were members of the AVEVA Solutions Limited's defined benefit pension
scheme. It is a contributory, funded, final salary occupational pension scheme approved by the Inland Revenue. Under this scheme they are
entitled to a pension on normal retirement, or on retirement due to ill health, equivalent to two-thirds of their pensionable salary provided
they have completed (or would have completed in the case of ill-health) twenty-five years' service. Inland Revenue earnings limits apply to
Paul Taylor when calculating final salary. Richard Longdon's salary for pension purposes is capped at  175,000. Future calculations of pension
entitlement will be based upon the capped salary plus increases in line with those applicable to Inland Revenue limits. A lower pension is
payable on earlier retirement after the age of fifty by agreement with the company. Pensions are payable to dependants on the director's
death in retirement and a lump sum is payable if death occurs in service.
The following directors had accrued entitlements under the pension scheme as follows:
