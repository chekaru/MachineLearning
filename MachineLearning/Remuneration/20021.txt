DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
This report has been prepared in accordance with Section 234B of the Companies Act 1985. The report also meets the relevant
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of
Good Governance relating to Directors' remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be 
proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements of the Company will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company members on the  auditable part' of the Directors' remuneration
report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985 (as amended). The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee's principal responsibility is to determine the remuneration of both the Company's executive Directors
and its senior management within broad policies agreed with the Board. In addition, it reviews the remuneration policy for the
Company as a whole. The remuneration of the non-executive Directors is determined by the executive Directors, not the Committee.
Copies of the Remuneration Committee terms of reference are available on request from the Company's registered office.
During the year the Committee comprised a Chairman (David Mann) and two non-executive Directors (Richard King and Colin
Garrett). Nick Prest was appointed to the Remuneration Committee on his appointment to the Board. The Chief Executive (Richard
Longdon) is invited to submit recommendations to the Committee and both he and the members of the Committee take into 
consideration relevant external market data as well as the reviews of remuneration for employees of the Group generally.
REMUNERATION POLICY 
The Committee aims to ensure that members of the executive management are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage
enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the
Company. It also aims for a combination of fixed and variable payments, benefit and share option plans that will achieve a balance
in incentives to achieve short and long-term goals.
BASIC SALARIES
In determining the basic salary of each executive Director the Committee takes account of the performance of the Company as a
whole and the performance of the individual in achieving financial and non-financial goals within his areas of responsibility.
BONUS PAYMENTS
The executive Directors participate in annual performance-related bonus schemes determined by the Committee. The schemes are
based substantially or entirely on the performance of the Company as a whole; part may be based on the achievement of personal
objectives. Bonuses payable in the year to 31 March 2006 amounted to Richard Longdon  157,000 (2005 -  132,000) and Paul Taylor
 102,000 (2005 -  86,000). For the year ended 31 March 2006 there was a cap on the bonus that an executive Director could earn
under the scheme and the maximum payable was 60% of basic salary. AVEVA Annual Report 2006 Directors' remuneration report 28

SHARE OPTIONS
The Committee considers that periodic grants of share-related incentives should constitute an important element of the 
remuneration of the Company's senior executives, in line with common practice in comparator companies. A Long-Term Incentive
Plan (LTIP) was established by the Company in 2004 and the dilution limits under the existing share option scheme were extended. 
During the year a total of 54,272 share options were granted to Richard Longdon and Paul Taylor under the AVEVA Group plc
Executive Share Option Plan.There were no share options granted under the LTIP during the year. Future options granted will be 
at a price equal to the nominal value of an ordinary share which is 10p and will be subject to condition of exercise. The extent to
which options will be capable of exercise will depend on the extent to which the condition of exercise has been satisfied. The
condition of exercise for the current LTIP awards is based on the ranking of the Company in terms of its total shareholder return
measured against other companies in a relevant London Stock Exchange index such as the techMARK 100 index. The option will
 vest' in accordance with the following scale:
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN RANKING PERCENTAGE VESTING OF SHARES SUBJECT TO OPTION
75 per cent and above 100 per cent
Median to 75 per cent Pro rata on a straight line basis
Median 33 per cent
Below median Nil
The performance conditions will be measured three years from the date of grant. There will be no retesting of the condition 
of exercise.
In determining the conditions of exercise for any future grants under the LTIP, the Remuneration Committee will take note of 
practical experience, professional advice, market trends and investor guidelines. 
SERVICE CONTRACTS
The service contracts and letters of appointment of the Directors include the following terms:
DATE OF CONTRACT DATE OF APPOINTMENT NOTICE PERIOD (MONTHS)
R A King 28 November 1996 28 November 1996 3
C A Garrett 14 July 2000 1 August 2000 3
R Longdon 28 November 1996 28 November 1996 12
D W Mann 17 May 2000 8 June 1999 3
P R Taylor 17 October 1989 1 March 2001 9
N Prest 10 January 2006 11 January 2006 3
The Committee considers that the notice periods of the executive Directors are in line with those in other companies of a similar
size and nature and are in the best interests of the Group to ensure stability in senior management. The non-executive and 
executive Directors retire at any Annual General Meeting where they are so required by the Articles of Association. 
There are no predetermined special provisions for executive or non-executive Directors with regard to compensation in the event of
loss of office. The Remuneration Committee would be responsible for considering the circumstances of the early termination and in
exceptional circumstances will determine compensation payments in excess of the Company's contractual obligations. AVEVA Annual Report 2006 Directors' remuneration report 29

The market price as at 31 March 2006 was  10.91 with a high-low spread for the year of  6.62 to  11.19. 
The aggregate gain on exercise of options by Directors for the year ended 31 March 2006 was  nil (2005 -  nil).
The options are normally exercisable in full or in part between the third and seventh anniversaries of the date of grant. All options
at an exercise price of  5.247 and  7.96 are subject to performance conditions, which require earnings per share to outperform 
RPI (utilisation) by a total of 10% over a three-year rolling period. The share option rules were established at the time of the
Company's initial public offering in 1996 and the performance conditions set were commonly used at that time. The options granted
at 10p are part of the LTIP scheme and are subject to performance criteria as set out on page 28.
PENSIONS
During the year, two Directors, (Richard Longdon and Paul Taylor) were members of AVEVA Solutions Limited's defined benefit 
pension scheme. It is a contributory, funded, occupational pension scheme approved by the Inland Revenue and since 1 October
2004 Career Average Revalued Earning benefits apply. Under this scheme they are entitled to a pension on normal retirement, or on
retirement due to ill health, equivalent to two-thirds of their pensionable salary provided they have completed (or would have
completed in the case of ill-health) twenty five years' service. Inland Revenue earnings limits apply to Paul Taylor when calculating
final salary. Similarly, a scheme-specific earnings limit applies to the benefits earned by Richard Longdon. A lower pension is
payable on earlier retirement after the age of fifty by agreement with the Company. Pensions are payable to dependants on the
Directors' death in retirement and a lump sum is payable if death occurs in service. No other Directors were members of a pension
scheme during the year (2005-none). AVEVA Annual Report 2006 Directors' remuneration report 31
