 Avev A Group plc Annual report 2011 www.aveva.com Directors' report 42
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 5 and 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008, the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
(together the Regulations). The report also describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors' remuneration. 
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the 
financial statements of the Company will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report on the  auditable part' of the Directors' remuneration report and to state whether, in their opinion, 
that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008. The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
UnAUDITED InFORMATIOn
Role of the Remuneration Committee 
The Board sets the remuneration policy for the Group. The Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the Board within its agreed 
terms of reference, details of which are available at www.aveva.com.
The Remuneration Committee's principal responsibility is to determine the remuneration package of both the Company's Executive Directors 
and its senior management within broad policies agreed with the Board. When reviewing and setting remuneration policy the Committee 
considered a range of factors including the prevailing economic environment and the evolving landscape in best practice guidelines to ensure 
that it remains appropriate. In addition, it reviews the remuneration policy for the Company as a whole and administers the Company's share 
incentive plans for all participants. The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Executive Directors and the Chairman, 
rather than the Committee.
The conclusions and recommendations of the Remuneration Committee were finalised in three formal meetings during the year, but these 
were preceded by several informal discussions, including some with advisers (none of whom had any other connection with the Company). 
The members of the Committee were Philip Dayer (Chairman), Nick Prest and Jonathan Brooks. David Mann was the Chairman of the Committee 
for the one meeting that was held prior to his retirement from the Board in July 2010.
The Chief Executive (Richard Longdon) is invited to submit recommendations to the Remuneration Committee and both he and the members 
of the Committee take into consideration relevant external market data, which was collated by independent remuneration consultants as well 
as the reviews of remuneration for employees of the Group generally. The Chief Executive was not present at the meetings.
Remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that members of the Executive management are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage 
enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Group. It also 
aims for a combination of fixed and variable payments, benefits and share-based awards that will achieve a balance in incentives to deliver short 
and long term goals. The Company's policy is that a substantial proportion of remuneration of Executive Directors should be performance-related 
and should be delivered in shares to create alignment with shareholders interests. For maximum levels of performance 69% of the CEO's and 
67% of the CFO's total remuneration would be performance related.
The payment of bonuses and the vesting of share incentives are subject to meeting performance conditions established by the Committee at the 
beginning of each performance period reflecting what, at that time, the Committee considers demanding targets. These targets are set taking 
account of the market in which the Group operates and the expectations of the investment community on the Group's future potential performance.
In 2008 the Board introduced the AVEVA Group Management Bonus Deferred Share Scheme 2008 (the Deferred Share Scheme) for Executive Directors 
and selected employees. The Committee considers that it is appropriate to have a deferred component to the bonus scheme in order to retain 
key individuals and to create enhanced alignment with shareholders. Subject to the achievement of performance conditions relating to a single 
financial year, these incentive arrangements are intended to reward the recipient partly in cash, payable on announcement of interim and/or final 
results, and partly in ordinary shares in the Company to be delivered on a deferred basis under the Deferred Share Scheme. 
The Remuneration Committee has access to detailed external research from independent consultants. During the year, the Committee, supported 
by Deloitte LLP , undertook a comprehensive review of executive remuneration arrangements. This review considered whether the Group's current 
remuneration arrangements are aligned with the future business strategy and the long-term creation of shareholder value, as well as considering 
whether pay levels were fair and appropriate for a company of the size and complexity of AVEVA.
The Committee concluded that the overall structure of remuneration arrangements remains appropriate and effectively incentivises executives 
to deliver on-going earnings growth as well as incentivising them to build a strong foundation for the AVEVA NET business. The successful delivery 
of the AVEVA NET strategy is considered to be crucial to the building of long-term shareholder value and therefore it is intended to continue to 
incentivise the delivery of this through the executive incentive arrangements.
Outside appointments
The Board believes that accepting non-executive appointments with other companies enhances the experience of Executive Directors and 
therefore they are entitled to accept appointments outside of the Company provided that Board approval is sought prior to accepting the 
appointment. Whether or not the Director concerned is permitted to retain their fees is considered on a case by case basis. Paul Taylor serves 
as a Non-Executive Director of Anite plc. His annual fee was  37,000. As Mr Taylor performed these services independently of his duties to the 
Company, he was thus entitled to receive such compensation. Paul Taylor resigned from the Board on 1 January 2011.
The individual components of the remuneration packages offered are:
Basic salaries
It is the policy of the Committee to pay base salaries to the Executive Directors taking account of the nature and scale of the business of the Group, 
the performance of the individual in achieving financial and non-financial goals within his areas of responsibility and comparable market data.

UnAUDITED InFORMATIOn continued
Remuneration policy continued
Basic salaries continued
In 2010/11, the Remuneration Committee, having duly considered the results of the benchmark review conducted by Deloitte LLP , concluded 
that given the experience and tenure of the Chief Executive and his strategic importance to the business, the remuneration opportunity for the 
Group Chief Executive was significantly behind market practice compared to other companies of a similar size and complexity. In light of this 
the Committee feel that it is reasonable and appropriate to bring his pay more in line with the market. The Committee is, therefore, intending to 
increase his basic salary to  390,000. The Committee plans to make this increase in two phases to avoid a significant one off increase. His salary, 
therefore, will be increased from  335,000 to  365,000 with effect from 1 April 2011 (an 8.9% increase) and then, subject to continued performance, 
to  390,000 (a 6.8% increase) to be effective from 1 April 2012. 
In keeping with a general review of salaries for the Group as a whole, the Chief Financial Officer received a salary increase of 3% in line with the 
average increase across the Group. 
Details of the current salaries with effect from 1 April 2011 are as follows:
             
Richard Longdon           365,000
James Kidd           175,100
Benefits
Executive Directors are provided with a Company car or a mobility allowance and a fuel allowance. Non-Executive Directors do not receive 
any benefits.
Bonus payments
The Executive Directors participate in annual performance-related bonus arrangements determined by the Committee. As noted above, these 
arrangements include a component using the Deferred Share Scheme. Under these incentive arrangements, depending on the extent to which 
performance conditions are achieved, an overall bonus amount is determined. 60% of this overall bonus amount is payable in cash, and the balance, 
40%, is used to calculate the number of ordinary shares which the bonus recipient is eligible to receive on a deferred basis. This is calculated 
by identifying the number of ordinary shares which could be purchased with the balance at the mid-market closing price of an ordinary share 
on the dealing day immediately preceding the preliminary announcement of the Company's results for the financial year in which the bonus 
was earned.
Deferred awards, which take the form of nil-cost options, will normally deliver the shares to participants in three equal tranches, one in each of the 
three years following the year in which an award is granted. These awards are made solely in respect of performance in the financial year immediately 
prior to their grant. Delivery of the deferred shares is not subject to further financial performance conditions provided that the participant remains 
an employee or Director of the Group. If the participant ceases to be an employee or Director, entitlement to all outstanding tranches would fall away 
unless the cessation occurs by reason of his or her death. Following the death of a bonus participant, or on a takeover, reconstruction or amalgamation, 
or voluntary winding up of the Company, the period for which the participant must remain an employee or Director would be reduced below the 
normal three years and entitlement to delivery of the shares would be accelerated. There are no arrangements for the delivery of additional 
matching shares to a participant in any circumstances.
2010/11 bonus
For the annual performance bonus arrangements for 2010/11, the bonus was primarily based on achieving stretching Group adjusted profit 
before tax (PBT) targets. In addition, 10% of the bonus was based on performance against strategic objectives for AVEVA NET. The agreed 
targets were considered to be appropriate and stretching against the budgeted profit for 2010/11 and market conditions prevailing at that time. 
10% of the bonus is based on achievement for the six months to 30 September and 90% based on the full year results. For 2010/11, the maximum 
bonus amount which an Executive Director could earn was 100% of basic salary. Performance targets were achieved in full, with the Group 
delivering 7.9% adjusted PBT growth and with continued strong performance in building a strong foundation for the AVEVA NET business 
resulting in a cash bonus equal to 60% (2010 - 60%) of basic salary with the remaining 40% (2010 - 40%) of the bonus amount being used 
to calculate the number of deferred shares for which each Executive Director was eligible. The Committee considered that this level of payout 
is appropriate both in the context of performance against targets as well as the underlying performance of the business in what continues to 
be challenging economic conditions. Paul Taylor's entitlement to a bonus payment in respect of the year 2010/11 was pro-rated in line with 
the date of his resignation from the Board and 100% of the bonus will be settled in cash.
2011/12 bonus
Given the importance of AVEVA NET to the long-term creation of shareholder value it was agreed that the 2011/12 bonus annual bonus will be 
based on a combination of the delivery of stretching Group adjusted profit before tax growth performance and the growth in AVEVA NET revenues. 
In addition, 10% of bonus payments to Executive Directors will be contingent on the achievement of personal objectives which are required 
to be agreed in advance on an individual basis by the Remuneration Committee. These individual objectives are linked to the delivery of the 
business strategy.
Pensions
During the year, the two Executive Directors (Richard Longdon and Paul Taylor) were members of AVEVA Solutions Limited's defined benefit 
pension scheme. It is a contributory, funded, occupational pension scheme registered with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and, since 
1 October 2004, Career Average Revalued Earnings benefits apply. Under this scheme they are entitled to a pension on normal retirement, 
or on retirement due to ill health, equivalent to two-thirds of their pensionable salary provided they have completed (or would have completed 
in the case of ill health) 25 years' service. A pension earnings cap (in line with historic HMRC's earning cap) applies to Paul Taylor when calculating 
pensionable salary. Similarly, a scheme-specific earnings limit applies to the benefits earned by Richard Longdon. A lower pension is payable 
on earlier retirement after the age of 50 by agreement with the Company and subject to HMRC guidelines. Pensions are payable to dependants 
on the Director's death in retirement and a lump sum is payable if death occurs in service.  Avev A Group plc Annual report 2011 www.aveva.com Directors' report 44

Remuneration policy continued
Pensions continued
Richard Longdon has now accrued the maximum benefits that he is entitled to under the rules of the pension scheme and as a result he is no longer 
accruing any further benefit. In 2009/10, Richard Longdon was paid a one-off sum of  25,000 in lieu of any further pension benefit. 
James Kidd is a member of the AVEVA Group Personal Pension Plan (a defined contribution scheme) and each year the Company contributes 10% 
of salary to the plan.
No other Directors were members of a pension scheme during the year (2010 - nil).
Share awards
The Remuneration Committee considers that periodic grants of share-related incentives should constitute an important element of the remuneration 
of the Company's senior Executives, in line with common practice in comparable companies. The Remuneration Committee will consult with major 
shareholders as appropriate. The Company's share schemes have been used to provide long term incentives to assist in creating and sustaining growth 
in share value. There are three schemes in existence, the AVEVA Group Management Bonus Deferred Share Scheme 2008, the AVEVA Group plc 
Long Term Incentive Plan and the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme 2007. No awards have been made under the AVEVA Group plc 
Executive Share Option Scheme 2007 and the performance conditions that would apply to them remain to be determined. 
The number of shares which may be allocated on exercise of any options granted under any of the Company's share option schemes (including 
employee schemes) shall not, when aggregated with the number of shares which have been allocated in the previous ten years under these schemes, 
exceed 10% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to that date. The share schemes are used to provide incentives 
to Senior Managers as well as Executive Directors. As recipients of these awards, Executive Directors and Executive Board members are required 
to hold or use the schemes to build share ownership with a value of at least 100% of their then current salary. Details of the awards made under 
these schemes are as follows: 
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Under the LTIP , options are granted to selected individuals to acquire ordinary shares at an exercise price equal to the nominal value of the 
shares (3.33 pence); these options will be exercisable only if stretching performance criteria are met. There are no rules under the LTIP 
scheme which govern the maximum awards that can be made to participants. However in 2010/11 the market value of awards under the LTIP 
awarded to Richard Longdon and Paul Taylor amounted to 100% and 80% of basic salary respectively (2010 - 50%). As noted above, during 
the year the Committee reviewed the level of remuneration arrangements to ensure that they remain appropriate compared to companies 
of a similar size. This review concluded that the CEO's total remuneration was behind that of similar sized companies, particularly in the context 
of the length of his tenure and performance during this time. The Committee, therefore, intends to increase the maximum LTIP grant from 
100% to 120% of base salary for 2011/12. The Committee believes that the increased LTIP opportunity will not only further align the Group 
CEO's personal reward with the future performance of the Company and shareholder value creation, but will also act as a strong retention 
tool for such a valuable member of the management team. The LTIP award for James Kidd the CFO will be set at 100% of base salary.
The Committee continues to believe that Earnings Per Share growth is an appropriate performance measure for awards under the LTIP , as growing 
earnings is strongly aligned with our long-term business strategy and the creation of shareholder value. 
In determining each of the awards under the LTIP , the Remuneration Committee considered and concluded that the performance conditions set 
were challenging in the context of internal and external expectations at the time of the awards. Details of the outstanding awards under the LTIP 
are as follows:
2007/08 awards
In 2007/08, a total of 18,234 nominal value share options were conditionally awarded to the Executive Directors under the LTIP . The performance 
conditions were based on average growth in EPS over the years from 2007/08 to 2009/10. If average EPS growth was greater than 11.5% per annum 
then all of the shares would vest. If average EPS was less than 9% per annum then none of the shares would vest. If average EPS growth was 
between 9% and 11.5% per annum then the number of shares that would vest would be determined by linear interpolation. Performance against 
these targets was tested during the year and awards vested in full.
2008/09 awards
In 2008/09, a total of 17,929 nominal value share options were conditionally awarded to the Executive Directors under the LTIP . The performance 
conditions are based on average growth in EPS over the years from 2009/10 to 2010/11. If average EPS growth is greater than 14% per annum 
then all of the shares shall vest. If average EPS is less than 10% per annum then none of the shares shall vest. If average EPS growth is between 
10% and 14% per annum then the number of shares that shall vest shall be determined by linear interpolation. Although the vesting date has not 
yet been reached, it is anticipated that the performance conditions attached to this award will not be met and therefore these awards shall lapse. 
2009/10 awards
In 2009/10, a total of 36,628 nominal value share options were conditionally awarded to the Executive Directors under the LTIP . In view of the 
general economic background, the Remuneration Committee gave especially careful consideration to what performance conditions would be 
appropriate and finally agreed that they should be based on average diluted EPS over the three years from 2009/10 to 2011/12. All shares under 
this option shall vest if average diluted EPS for the three years ending 31 March 2012 is equal to or above 52.14 pence. Should average diluted 
EPS for the period be below 52.14 pence, then no shares will vest and the option will lapse.
2010/11 awards
In 2010/11, a total of 37,961 nominal value share options were awarded to Executive Directors under the LTIP . The performance conditions are based 
on average EPS growth over the three years from 2010/11 to 2012/13. If average diluted EPS growth is more than 12% above RPI for the same 
period then all of the shares under this option will vest. If average diluted EPS growth is less than 4% above RPI then none of the shares will vest. 
If average EPS growth is between 4% and 12% per annum then the number of shares that shall vest shall be determined by linear interpolation.

Deferred annual bonus share plan
As described above, part of the annual bonus earned by Executive Directors in the year is used to determine eligibility for an award of deferred 
shares under the Deferred Share Scheme. In order to deliver shares under the Deferred Share Scheme, an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) was 
established following shareholder approval at the 2008 Annual General Meeting. Awards of deferred shares are made by the trustee of EBT 
using shares purchased in the market. 
On 15 June 2010 the EBT awarded 12,471 and 8,046 deferred shares to Richard Longdon and Paul Taylor respectively in respect of the bonus 
arrangements for the year ended 31 March 2010. 
Following the achievement of the objectives for 2010/11, it is anticipated that 8,536 and 1,082 deferred shares will be awarded to Richard Longdon 
and James Kidd respectively in respect of the bonus arrangements for the year ended 31 March 2011.
Total shareholder return performance graph
The Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 require the presentation of a performance graph 
of total shareholder return compared with a broad equity market index for a period of five years. The following graph shows the Company's performance, 
measured by total shareholder return, compared with the performance of the techMARK All-Share Index. Total shareholder return is the share 
price plus dividends reinvested compared against the techMARK All-Share Index, rebased to the start of the period. 
Total shareholder return v techMARK All-Share Index 2006-2011
The Directors consider the techMARK All-Share Index to be an appropriate choice as the Index includes AVEVA Group plc.
Service contracts
The service contracts and letters of appointment of the Directors include the following terms:
       Expiry/review date of   Notice period 
   Date of contract   Date of appointment  current contract  Months
Nick Prest 10 January 2006 11 January 2006  11 January 2012 3

Richard Longdon 28 November 1996 28 November 1996 Rolling 12
James Kidd 1 January 2011 1 January 2011 Rolling 9
The Committee considers that the notice periods of the Executive Directors are in line with those in other companies of a similar size and nature 
and are in the best interests of the Group to ensure stability in senior management. 
There are no predetermined special provisions for Executive or Non-Executive Directors with regard to compensation in the event of loss of office. 
The Remuneration Committee would be responsible for considering the circumstances of the early termination of an Executive Director's contract 
and determining whether in exceptional circumstances there should be compensation payments in excess of the Company's contractual obligations.
non-Executive Director fees
Fees for the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are determined taking account of the individual's responsibilities; time devoted to the role 
and prevalent market rates. The fees for the Non-Executive Directors have been reviewed during the year and were brought in line with comparable 
companies. Non-executive fee policy was therefore increased to a basis fee of  39,000 with an additional fee of  5,000 for chairmanship of the 
Remuneration and Audit Committees. The Chairman of the Company receives an all inclusive fee of  110,000. T otal fees for Non-Executive Directors 
are summarised below:
             
Nick Prest (Chairman)           110,000
