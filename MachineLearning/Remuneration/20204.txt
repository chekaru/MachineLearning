 Remuneration Committee report
Philip Dayer | Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
I am pleased to present this year's Report on Directors' Remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee believes that remuneration 
arrangements should align Executive Directors with the delivery 
of the long term strategy and the creation of shareholder value 
while rewarding Executives fairly if success is achieved. 
 DeaR Sha Reho l DeR
The Department for Business Innovation and Skills ( BIS') has 
prescribed new executive remuneration disclosure requirements 
that will come into force for AVEVA 's 2014 annual report. At the time 
of writing this year's Directors' Remuneration Report, the regulations 
are not yet final. Nevertheless, the Remuneration Committee has 
decided to include additional information this year based on the draft 
regulations such as a single total figure of remuneration for each 
director and a summary remuneration policy table. 
Pay fo R PeRfo RmanCe
AVEVA has continued to perform well over the course of 2012/13 
and has delivered strong revenue growth of 12% and adjusted 
basic earnings per share growth of 17%. We also completed 
the acquisitions of Bocad and Global Majic and, in October 2012, 
launched a major new flagship product initiative, AVEVA E3D 
which the Board believes will offer strong growth opportunities 
going forward. In this context the Committee determined that 
the CEO would be awarded a bonus of 94% of base salary 
and the CFO would be awarded a bonus of 94% of base salary.
Over the long term, we have continued to deliver strong performance 
with EPS growth of 7% in excess of RPI over the last three years. 
This will result in 33% of the 2010 LTIP vesting. During this period 
total shareholder return increased by 98% and our dividend increased 
from 16.9 pence to 24.00 pence (excluding the special dividend) 
generating significant value to shareholders.
Dialogue with Sha Reho l DeRS
In recent years the Remuneration Committee has increased 
the number of its consultations with its largest shareholders 
and this year the Remuneration Committee has introduced 
a new section in the Directors' Remuneration Report entitled 
 Dialogue with Shareholders' to report: (1) the extent of its 
consultations with shareholders; (2) the major issues that have 
emerged through that dialogue; and, (3) how the Remuneration 
Committee has responded to those issues.
The Committee is mindful that shareholders each have differing 
views on executive remuneration arrangements and the Committee 
seeks to reflect, where possible, the views of the majority of 
shareholders whilst still operating arrangements which are 
considered to be in the best interest of the business and the creation 
of long term shareholder value. During late 2012 and early 2013, 
the Committee consulted extensively with our major shareholders 
on the performance conditions for our LTIP and the proposed 
changes to the annual bonus. Generally those shareholders 
consulted were supportive of the changes proposed for 2013/14.
exeCutive RemuneRatio n
In line with salary increases being awarded across the Group which 
average 5%, Richard Longdon, the Chief Executive, will receive a 4% 
salary increase effective from 1 April 2013 to  405,600. James Kidd 
was promoted to the role of Chief Financial Officer in January 2011. 
On appointment, his remuneration arrangements were positioned 
significantly below the lower end of the market competitive range 
given that he was new to a CFO role. As reported last year, but 
which was subject to strong performance in 2012/13, his salary 
has been increased to  260,000 effective from 1 April 2013.
In order to further support the delivery of outperformance, the 
Committee has decided that from 2013/14 the stretch in the performance 
targets for the annual bonus should be increased at both threshold 
and maximum levels of performance. To reward management for 
the delivery of additional shareholder value and outperformance 
the maximum bonus opportunity will be increased from 100% to 
125% of base salary. Achievement of any of the additional 25% 
for outperformance would be satisfied wholly in deferred shares.
T aking into account the feedback received from our shareholders last 
year, the Committee undertook a review of the Long term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP) to ensure performance measures used continued to 
be appropriate for the Group and that the level of reward delivered 
at differing levels of performance remained appropriate. We used 
Deloitte LLP to assist us with this review. The conclusion of the review 
was that earnings per share remains the most appropriate measure 
to incentivise the delivery of the Group's strategic objectives. This 
conclusion was then the subject of shareholder consultations in 
December 2012. A further round of shareholder consultations was 
conducted in April 2013. The Committee decided to increase the 
level of stretch in the target ranges for LTIP awards to be granted 
in 2013. These awards will fully vest provided that average annual 
growth in adjusted diluted EPS of 18% or more is achieved.
agenDa fo R 2013/14
The Committee will continue to keep the structure and details 
of our remuneration arrangements under review and will prepare 
for the new Executive Remuneration reporting requirements being 
introduced in the UK. The Committee last undertook an Executive 
remuneration benchmark exercise in 2011 and proposes to 
commission the next Executive remuneration survey in early 2014. 
We remain committed to strong communication with shareholders 
and will continue to consult with investors as appropriate.

FINANCIALS GOVERNANCE BUSINESS REVIEW OVERVIEW
Directors' report This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedules 5 
and 8 to the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, the relevant 
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority and the UK Corporate Governance Code (together 
the Regulations). The report also describes how the Board has 
applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors' 
remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution 
to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements 
of the Company will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditor to report on the  auditable 
part' of the Directors' remuneration report and to state whether, 
in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Large and Medium Sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. The report 
has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited 
and unaudited information.

Role of the Remune Ration Committee 
The Board sets the remuneration policy for the Group. 
The Remuneration Committee makes recommendations 
to the Board within its agreed terms of reference, details 
of which are available at www.aveva.com.
The Remuneration Committee's principal responsibility is to determine 
the remuneration package of both the Company's Executive Directors 
and its senior management within broad policies agreed with 
the Board. When reviewing and setting remuneration policy the 
Committee considered a range of factors including the Company's 
strategy and circumstances, the prevailing economic environment 
and the evolving landscape in best practice guidelines to ensure 
that it remains appropriate. In addition, it reviews the remuneration 
policy for the Company as a whole and oversees and approves the 
Company's share incentive plans for all participants. The remuneration 
of the Non Executive Directors is determined by the Executive 
Directors and the Chairman, rather than the Committee.
The conclusions and recommendations of the Remuneration 
Committee were finalised in four formal meetings during the year, 
but these were preceded by several informal discussions, including 
some with advisers (none of whom had any other connection with 
the Company). The members of the Committee were Philip Dayer 
(Chairman), Phil Aiken and Jonathan Brooks. Nick Prest was 
a committee member until his retirement in July 2012. 
The Chief Executive (Richard Longdon) is invited to submit 
recommendations to the Remuneration Committee and to 
attend meetings when appropriate. he was not present when 
his own remuneration was discussed.
The Committee has access to external advisers as required. 
During the year the Committee received advice from Deloitte LLP . 
Deloitte also provided unrelated advisory services to the Group 
in respect of taxation advice during the year. Deloitte is one of 
the founding members of the Remuneration Consultants Code 
of Conduct and adheres to this Code in its dealings with the 
Committee. The Committee is satisfied that the advice provided 
by Deloitte is independent.
RemuneRation P ol iCy
The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that members 
of the Executive management are provided with appropriate 
incentives to align them with the Company's strategy and 
the future creation of shareholder value, encourage enhanced 
performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded 
for their individual contributions to the success of the Group. 
It also aims for a combination of fixed and variable payments, 
benefits and share based awards that will achieve a balance 
in incentives to deliver short and long term goals. The Company's 
policy is that a substantial proportion of remuneration of Executive 
Directors should be performance related and should be delivered 
in shares to create alignment with shareholders' interests. 
Remuneration for Executive Directors is set in the context 
of the economic environment in which the Group operates, 
the outcome of the wider pay review for all Group employees 
as well as the financial performance of the Group. When 
determining remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes 
into consideration relevant external market data as well 
as the remuneration for employees of the Group generally.
linking pay with strategy
The Committee's guiding philosophy is that remuneration 
arrangements that operate throughout the Group should support 
the delivery of our long term business strategy and therefore the 
creation of shareholder value. Our key long term strategic priority 
is to deliver strong but sustainable EPS growth. To support the 
delivery of this strategic priority:
 B Our annual bonus arrangements incentivise the delivery of 
adjusted PBT performance and the achievement of key individual 
objectives that are aligned with the delivery of our strategy. 
 B EPS growth is the primary measure used for long term 
incentive arrangements. 
The payment of bonuses and the vesting of share incentives 
are subject to stretching targets established by the Committee 
at the beginning of each performance period. These targets are 
set taking account of the markets in which the Group operates, 
our long term growth ambitions and the expectations of the 
investment community on the Group's future potential performance.
The Committee considers that it is appropriate to have a deferred 
component to the bonus scheme in order to retain key individuals 
and to create enhanced alignment with shareholders. Subject to 
the achievement of performance conditions relating to a single 
financial year, these incentive arrangements are intended to reward 
the recipient partly in cash, payable on announcement of interim 
and/or final results, and partly in ordinary shares in the Company to 
be delivered on a deferred basis under the Deferred Share Scheme.
employee context
AVEVA undertakes an annual salary review in April each year 
and uses this opportunity to reward strong performance and 
ensure salaries are in line with market rates. It manages this in 
a competitive environment particularly in the fast growth economic 
areas. The overall increase in employee salaries across the Group 
for 2013/14 is expected to be 5%.

Directors' report Performance related reward
For maximum levels of performance and excluding the value of 
any LTIP awards, 55% of the CEO's and CFO's total remuneration 
is performance related (2012/13 - 50%). Including the value of 
LTIP awards, performance related elements are 71% and 69% for 
the CEO and CFO respectively (2012 - 69% and 67% respectively). 
Dialogue with shareholders
The views of our shareholders on remuneration matters is 
important to the Committee and prior to making any material 
changes to remuneration arrangements the Committee consults 
with key shareholders to obtain their views. 
In last year's Directors' Remuneration Report we outlined some 
changes to remuneration arrangements and consulted with 
shareholders regarding these changes. Shareholders were 
generally supportive of most aspects of the proposals, however, 
some shareholders and corporate governance bodies expressed 
concerns regarding the use of a single performance measure for 
the long term incentive plan and the levels of EPS targets. 
In light of this, in December 2012, the Committee undertook, 
in conjunction with our independent advisers Deloitte, a detailed 
review of performance measures. Following this review, the 
Committee concluded that earnings per share continued to be 
the most appropriate measure to incentivise the delivery of the 
Group's business strategy. The Committee shared the outcome 
of this review with key shareholders. 
In April 2013, the Committee consulted with shareholders regarding 
the changes to the annual bonus arrangements and the increase 
in the stretch of the EPS targets for 2013 LTIP awards. Shareholders 
consulted were generally supportive of the changes.
The Company remains committed to engaging with shareholders 
in relation to remuneration issues.
RemuneRation element S
Basic salaries
It is the policy of the Committee to pay base salaries to the 
Executive Directors taking account of the nature, complexity 
and scale of the business of the Group, the performance of the 
individual in achieving financial and non financial goals within 
his areas of responsibility and comparable market data.
In line with range of salary increase awards for the Group's 
employees, the CEO's salary will be increased by 4% to  405,600 
effective from the 1 April 2013. 
As set out last year and following shareholder consultation, it was 
decided that the salary of the CFO should increase to  260,000 
over a two year period subject to continued good performance. 
Following a review of the CFO's performance in the year, it was 
considered appropriate that the second increment of this salary 
adjustment should be applied and that James Kidd's salary effective 
from 1 April 2013 should be increased from  230,000 to  260,000.
Benefits
In line with benefits provided for other senior employees, Executive 
Directors are provided with a company car or a mobility allowance, 
a fuel allowance and a  500 annual allowance towards a range 
of flexible benefits. Non Executive Directors do not receive 
any benefits. 
Bonus payments
The Executive Directors participate in annual performance related 
bonus arrangements determined by the Committee. For 2012/13 
the maximum bonus opportunity for Executive Directors was 100% 
of base salary. These arrangements include a component using 
the Deferred Share Scheme. Under these incentive arrangements, 
depending on the extent to which performance conditions are 
achieved, an overall bonus amount is determined. At 100% 
achievement of bonus performance conditions, 60% of the bonus 
amount is payable in cash and the balance, 40%, is used to calculate 
the number of ordinary shares which the bonus recipient is eligible 
to receive on a deferred basis over three years. If the bonus amount 
is less than or equal to 70% of the potential maximum bonus, 
then 75% of the bonus is paid in cash and 25% paid in deferred 
shares. If the bonus amount is between 70% and 100% of the 
potential maximum then the proportion paid in deferred shares 
is determined by linear interpolation between 25% and 40%.
Deferred awards, which take the form of nil cost options, 
will normally deliver the shares to participants in three equal 
tranches, one in each of the three years following the year in 
which an award is granted. Delivery of the deferred shares is 
not subject to further financial performance conditions but the 
participant must remain an employee or Director of the Group. 
Exceptions to this may be granted by the Committee for 
compassionate reasons or in the event of a takeover, reconstruction 
or amalgamation, or voluntary winding up of the Company. In such 
instances the period for which the participant must remain an 
employee or Director would be reduced below the normal three 
years and entitlement to delivery of the shares may be accelerated.

FINANCIALS GOVERNANCE BUSINESS REVIEW OVERVIEW
Directors' report Remuneration Committee report
Continued
RemuneRation element S continued
Bonus payments continued
Under the annual bonus plan in respect of awards granted from 
2012 onwards, any deferred element is subject to clawback prior 
to vesting if it is subsequently discovered that there has been 
a material misstatement of results in achieving the original bonus 
or for gross misconduct.
2012/13 bonus
For the annual performance bonus arrangements for 2012/13, 
65% of bonus was based on achieving stretching Group adjusted 
profit before tax (PBT) targets. In addition, 25% of the bonus was 
based on performance against growth objectives for Enterprise 
Solutions. The agreed targets were considered to be appropriate 
and stretching against the budgeted profit for 2011/12 and market 
conditions prevailing at that time. 10% of the potential bonus 
is contingent upon achievement of key individual performance 
objectives which had been agreed by the Remuneration Committee 
at the start of the financial year. These metrics are specific and 
measurable and are linked to the strategy and operation of the 
business. Of the 90% of the bonus based on financial performance, 
10% is based on achievement for the six months to 30 September 
and the remaining 80% is based on the full year results. 
For 2012/13, full year performance targets (including that related 
to Enterprise Solutions) were partially achieved, with the Group 
delivering 14% adjusted PBT growth and Enterprise Solutions 
achieving a contribution of  2,015,000. Performance targets in 
respect of the half year to 30 September 2012 were met in full. 
This resulted in a total bonus of 94% of base salary which 
comprised a cash bonus equal to 59% (2012 - 51%) of basic 
salary and 35% (2012 - 17%) of basic salary being used to calculate 
the number of deferred shares for which each Executive Director 
was eligible. The Committee considered that this level of payout 
is appropriate both in the context of performance against targets 
as well as the underlying performance of the business in what 
continue to be challenging economic conditions.
2013/14 bonus
For the annual performance bonus arrangements for 2013/14, it was 
agreed that 90% of bonus shall be based on achieving stretching 
Group adjusted profit before tax (PBT) targets. The agreed targets 
were considered to be appropriate and stretching against the 
budgeted profit for 2013/14 and prevailing market conditions. 
10% of the potential bonus is contingent upon achievement 
of key individual performance objectives which had been agreed 
by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the financial year. 
These metrics are specific and measurable and are linked to the 
strategy and operation of the business. Of the 90% of the bonus 
based on financial performance, 10% is based on achievement 
for the six months to 30 September and the remaining 80% is 
based on the full year results. 
For 2013/14 the maximum proportion of bonus payable at 
achievement of financial targets is 47% (2012 - 72%). However, 
the maximum bonus opportunity for the Executive Directors has 
increased from 100% to 125% with the additional 25% available 
only for overachievement above 110% of target. The entire 
overachievement element, if earned, would be payable in 
deferred shares.
Pensions
Since 2010 when he had accrued the maximum benefits that he 
is entitled to under the scheme rules, Richard Longdon has been 
a deferred member of AVEVA Solutions Limited's defined benefit 
pension scheme. He is no longer accruing any further benefit. 
It is a contributory, funded, occupational pension scheme 
registered with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and, since 
1 October 2004, Career Average Revalued Earnings benefits 
apply. Under this scheme he is entitled to a pension on normal 
retirement, or on retirement due to ill health, equivalent to 
two thirds of his pensionable salary provided he has completed 
(or would have completed in the case of ill health) 25 years' 
service. A scheme specific earnings limit applies to the benefits 
earned by Richard Longdon. A lower pension is payable on earlier 
retirement after the age of 50 by agreement with the Company 
and subject to HMRC guidelines. Pensions are payable to dependants 
on the Director's death in retirement and a lump sum is payable 
if death occurs in service.
James Kidd is a member of the AVEVA Group Personal Pension 
Plan (a defined contribution scheme) and each year the Company 
contributes 10% of salary to the plan. James Kidd also contributes 
7.5% of base salary into the plan via salary sacrifice.
No other Directors were members of a pension scheme during 
the year (2012 - nil).
Share awards
There are three share schemes in existence: the AVEVA Group 
Management Bonus Deferred Share Scheme 2008, the AVEVA 
Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan and the AVEVA Group plc 
Executive Share Option Scheme 2007 (which is not currently in use). 
The Company share schemes are used to provide long term 
incentives to assist in creating and sustaining growth in share value.

Directors' report reward of the Company's senior Executives. This is in line with 
common practice in comparable companies and is cascaded to 
senior managers as appropriate. The Remuneration Committee 
consults with major shareholders and their representative bodies 
regarding the operation of these schemes. 
The number of shares which may be allocated on exercise of 
any options granted under any of the Company's share option 
schemes (including employee schemes) shall not, when aggregated 
with the number of shares which have been allocated in the previous 
ten years under these schemes, exceed 10% of the ordinary share 
capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to that date. There 
is also a claw back provision for the Executive Directors' awards 
in the event of material misstatement of results. As recipients of 
these awards, Executive Directors and Executive Board members 
are required to hold or use the schemes to build a minimum 
share ownership. 
The shareholding requirement from vesting awards for the CEO and 
CFO are at 200% and 100% of salary respectively. As at 31 March 2013 
the CEO exceeds his holding requirement and the CFO holds 52% 
of salary accumulated since his appointment in 2011.
Details of the awards made under these schemes are as follows:
lo ng  term incentive Plan (l ti P)
Under the LTIP , options are granted to selected individuals to 
acquire ordinary shares at an exercise price equal to the nominal 
value of the shares (3.33 pence); these options will be exercisable 
only if stretching performance criteria are met. For 2011/12 and 
2012/13 the market value of awards under the LTIP awarded to 
Richard Longdon and James Kidd amounted to 120% and 100% 
of basic salary respectively (2010/11 - 100%). The maximum 
award under the LTIP will be 250% of salary, which will only 
be awarded in exceptional circumstances, e.g. on recruitment.
LTIP awards from 2012 onwards are subject to clawback prior 
to vesting if it is subsequently discovered that there has been 
a material misstatement of results in achieving the original 
bonus or for gross misconduct. 
The Committee continues to believe that earnings per share 
growth is an appropriate performance measure for awards 
under the LTIP , as growing earnings is strongly aligned with our 
long term business strategy and the creation of shareholder value. 
This was discussed with shareholders following consultations 
in December 2012 and again in April 2013. In determining each 
of the awards under the LTIP , the Remuneration Committee 
considered and concluded that the performance conditions 
set were challenging in the context of internal and external 
expectations at the time of the awards. 
2013/14 awards
It is intended that nominal priced share options be awarded 
to Executive Directors and that, similar to previous awards, 
the performance conditions should be based on EPS growth over 
the three year period from 2013/14 to 2015/16. however, in light of 
the feedback received from shareholders last year, the Committee 
has decided to increase the level of stretch in the target ranges 
for the LTIP awards from those adopted in 2012. 25% of the awards 
will vest for average annual adjusted diluted EPS growth is 12% 
per annum with maximum vesting (100% of award) for average 
annual adjusted diluted EPS growth of 18% per annum (linear 
interpolation between these points). The Remuneration Committee 
believes that these targets are appropriately stretching and if 
delivered represent significant value creation for shareholders.
2010/11 awards
Awards were granted in July 2010 to Executive Directors subject 
to the delivery of EPS growth performance. Average EPS growth 
for the three year period from 2010/11 to 2012/13 exceeded RPI 
by 7% per annum and therefore 33% of the award shall vest. 
The Committee considered this level of vesting in the context of 
the wider performance of the business and returns to shareholders 
during the period and considered that it was appropriate.
Deferred annual bonus share plan
As described above, part of the annual bonus earned by 
Executive Directors in the year is used to determine eligibility 
for an award of deferred shares under the Deferred Share 
Scheme. In order to deliver shares under the Deferred Share 
Scheme, an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) was established 
following shareholder approval at the 2008 Annual General 
Meeting. Awards of deferred shares are made by the trustee 
of the EBT using shares purchased in the market.
On 6 July 2012 the EBT awarded 4,189 and 2,009 deferred shares 
to Richard Longdon and James Kidd respectively in respect of 
the bonus arrangements for the year ended 31 March 2012.
Following the achievement of the objectives for 2012/13, 
it is anticipated that 5,903 and 3,481 deferred shares will be 
awarded to Richard Longdon and James Kidd respectively 
in respect of the bonus arrangements for the year ended 
31 March 2013.

AVEVA GROUP PLC
TECHMARK ALL-SHARE INDEX
The Large and Medium Sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 require the presentation 
of a performance graph of total shareholder 
return compared with a broad equity 
market index for a period of five years. 
The graph shows the Company's 
performance, measured by total 
shareholder return, compared with the 
performance of the techMARK All Share 
Index. Total shareholder return is the 
share price plus dividends reinvested 
compared against the techMARK 
All Share Index, rebased to the start 
of the period.
The directors consider the techMARK 
All Share Index to be an appropriate 
choice as the Index includes 
AVEVA Group plc.

Poli Cy fo R le ave RS
The Committee considers that the notice periods of the Executive 
Directors are in line with those in other companies of a similar size 
and nature and are in the best interests of the Group to ensure 
stability in senior management. The service agreements provide 
for a period of garden leave not exceeding six months.
There are no predetermined special provisions for Executive 
or Non Executive Directors with regard to compensation in 
the event of loss of office. Their continuous service date for 
the purposes of the Employments rights Act 1996 are for the CEO 
29 May 1984 and for the CFO 5 January 2004. The Remuneration 
Committee would be responsible for considering the circumstances 
of the early termination of an Executive Director's contract and 
determining whether in exceptional circumstances there should 
be compensation payments in excess of the Company's contractual 
obligations. Such circumstances ( good leaver') where the earlier 
vesting of share awards may be granted are in the event of 
termination of office as a result of injury or disability, redundancy, 
in the event of early or normal retirement, or in the event of 
a change of control or ownership resulting in the Executive 
no longer being employed by the Group or being an employee 
or officer of the Group.
ReCRuitment of new exeCuti ve DiReCto RS
In the event of hiring a new Executive Director, the Committee 
will typically align the remuneration package with the above 
remuneration policy. However, the Committee retains the 
discretion to make remuneration proposals on hiring a new 
Executive Director which are outside the standard policy to 
facilitate the hiring of someone of the calibre required to 
deliver the Group's strategy.
The Committee may make awards on hiring an external 
candidate to 'buyout' remuneration arrangements forfeited 
on leaving a previous employer. In doing so the Committee 
would take account of relevant factors including any performance 
conditions attached to these awards, the form in which they 
were granted (eg cash or shares) and the time over which 
they would have vested. Generally buy  out awards would 
be made on a comparable basis.
non  exeCutive Di ReCto R feeS
Fees for the Chairman and the Non Executive Directors are 
determined taking account of the individual's responsibilities, 
time devoted to the role and prevalent market rates. Non Executive 
Directors receive a basic fee of  45,760 per annum. Additional fees 
of  10,400 are paid to Non Executive Directors who hold the position 
of Committee Chairman. Annual fees for Non Executive Directors 
are summarised below:
  
Philip Aiken (Chairman) 150,800
Jonathan Brooks (Chair of the Audit Committee) 56,160
Philip Dayer (Chair of the Remuneration Committee) 56,160
Herv  Couturier 45,760
out SiDe aPPoint ment S
The Board believes that accepting non executive appointments with 
other companies enhances the experience of Executive Directors 
and therefore they are entitled to accept appointments outside 
of the Company provided that Board approval is sought prior 
to accepting the appointment. Whether or not the Director 
concerned is permitted to retain their fees is considered on 
a case by case basis. Richard Longdon was appointed as an 
adviser to Detica, a division of BAE Systems in July 2011. Prior 
to his appointment, the Board considered the impact on his role 
as CEO and concluded that he could still devote sufficient time 
to his role and therefore approved his appointment. Mr Longdon 
does not receive a salary for this role but is paid a daily fee for 
attendance. As Mr Longdon performs these services independently 
of his duties to the Company, he is thus entitled to receive 
such compensation.

this was the LTIP award of 2010. The shares have not yet vested and so the value of the benefit has been estimated using the average share price during the three 
months prior to the 31 March 2013.
