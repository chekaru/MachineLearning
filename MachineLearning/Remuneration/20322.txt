 Report of the Directors on remuneration
Composition
The Remuneration Committee comprises the two Non-Executive Directors; S M Bruh (Chairman) and J J Hamer, and K M Baker.
Principal function
The remuneration packages, including contract periods of Executive Directors and senior management, are determined by the
Remuneration Committee. It ensures that the remuneration packages are appropriate for their responsibilities, taking into
consideration the overall financial and business position of the Group.
Compliance 
The Remuneration Committee is both constituted and operated throughout the period in accordance with the principles
outlined in the Financial Services Authority Listing Rules derived from Schedule A of the Combined Code.  
Base salary and benefits
The Committee sets the salary of each Executive Director by reference to the responsibility of the position held, performance
of the individual, and external market data.  Salaries are reviewed annually.
Annual performance related bonus
The Company operates a bonus scheme for its Directors which enables it to attract and retain high calibre senior management
personnel who make a major contribution to the financial performance of the company.  Bonuses paid under the scheme are
directly linked to the growth in the Group's earnings per share.
Share options
The Committee is responsible for approving grants to the Executive Directors. Options may be exercised between three and
ten years from the date the option is granted but only if certain performance criteria are satisfied. 
Pensions
The Company is responsible for the contributions to the defined contribution schemes selected by the Executive Directors.
Details of contributions provided in the year are set out later in this report.
Service agreements
K M Baker, S J Lawrence and S M King have service contract's which are terminable on 12 months notice by either party. The
Committee consider that these contracts are in line with the market. 
Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors' remuneration is reviewed by all members of the Board other than the Non-Executive Director under
review and takes the form solely of fees. J J Hamer and S M Bruh have a letter of appointment terminable on 3 months notice
by either party.
Compensation for loss of office
There are no predetermined special provisions for Executive or Non-executive Directors with regard to compensation in the
event of loss of office. The Remuneration Committee considers the circumstances of individual cases of early termination
and determines compensation payments accordingly with the aim not to reward poor performance.
Directors' emoluments
Details of the remuneration of all Directors are set out in note 6 to the Accounts.

The share options are exercisable from 2 October 2006 to 25 October 2014 if the basic earnings per share of Avingtrans plc
during the period between grant and exercise, is at least equal to the increase in the Retail Price Index during the same period
and if the Director agrees to release their rights under the Warrant package for the same number of shares.
Warrant packages
As part of the purchase agreement of the Jena Group K M Baker and S J Lawrence were issued 1,040,000 and 560,000
warrants respectively at an exercise price of 50p, these vested if certain performance targets were achieved. 
Following the audited results for the year to 31 May 2005, K M Baker and S J Lawrence exercised 772,000 and 398,000
warrants resulting in gains of  757,000 and  387,000 respectively. K M Baker and S J Lawrence surrendered their rights over
60,000 and 50,000 warrants respectively, in favour of an equivalent number of share options.
At 31 May 2006 K M Baker and S J Lawrence hold 208,000 and 112,000 warrants which would have vested as the earnings
per share for the year ended 31 May 2006 was greater than 12.41p.
If in respect of any financial year the relevant earnings per share target (  EPS Target Figure'') has not been reached, so that
the Auditors' Certificate confirms that the actual earnings per share for the relevant Subscription Period (the   Actual EPS
Figure'') is less than the EPS Target Figure, then the relevant tranche of Warrants capable of being exercised in respect of the
relevant Subscription Period shall be reduced by a percentage being twice the percentage by which the Actual EPS Figure fell
short of the EPS Target Figure.
In the event that the above paragraph applies, the Warrants no longer exercisable in respect of a Subscription Period may be
exercised by the warrant holder on or at any time after the next Subscription Period in respect of which the Auditors' Certificate
confirms that the Actual EPS Figure for that subsequent Subscription Period is equal to or greater than the EPS Target Figure
for the same subsequent Subscription Period.
