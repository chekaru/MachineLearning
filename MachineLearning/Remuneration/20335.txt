of the individual, and external market data.  Salaries are reviewed annually.
Annual performance related bonus
The Company operates a bonus scheme for its Directors which enables it to attract and retain high calibre senior management
personnel who make a major contribution to the financial performance of the Group.  Bonuses paid under the scheme are directly
linked to the annual growth in the Group's earnings per share or annual increase in the share price of the company at the balance
sheet date.

Compensation for loss of office
