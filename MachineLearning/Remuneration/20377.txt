Principal function
The remuneration packages, including contract periods of Executive Directors and senior management, are determined by the
Remuneration Committee. It ensures that the remuneration packages are appropriate for their responsibilities, taking into
consideration the overall financial and business position of the Group. The remuneration of R S McDowell was determined by
the two Non-executive Directors.
Compliance 
The Remuneration Committee was both constituted and operated throughout the period in accordance with the principles
outlined in the Financial Services Authority Listing Rules derived from Schedule A of the Combined Code.  
Base salary and benefits
The Committee sets the salary of each Executive Director by reference to the responsibility of the position held, performance of
the individual, and external market data.  Salaries are reviewed annually.
Annual performance related bonus
The Company operates a bonus scheme for its Directors which enables it to attract and retain high calibre senior management
personnel who make a major contribution to the financial performance of the Group.  Bonuses paid under the scheme are directly
linked to the annual growth in the Group' s earnings per share.
Share options
The Committee is responsible for approving grants of share options to the Executive Directors. Options may be exercised
between three and ten years from the date the option is granted but only if certain performance criteria are satisfied. 
Pensions

Details of contributions provided in the year are set out in note 5 to the financial statements.

terminable on 3 months notice by either party.
Compensation for loss of office
