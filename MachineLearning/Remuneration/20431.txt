The Remuneration Committee was both constituted and operated throughout the period in accordance with the principles
outlined in Section D of the UK Corporate Governance Code.  
Base salary and benefits
The Committee sets the salary of each Executive Director by reference to the responsibility of the position held, performance
of the individual and external market data. Salaries are reviewed annually.
Annual performance related bonus
The Company operates a bonus scheme for its Directors which enables it to attract and retain high calibre senior management
personnel who make a major contribution to the financial performance of the Group. Bonuses paid under the scheme are accrued
under the annual bonus plan approved by the Remuneration Committee. The plan is based on various financial metrics around
cash and financial performance.
Share options
The Committee is responsible for approving grants of share options to the Executive Directors. Options may be exercised
between three and ten years from the date the option is granted but only if certain performance criteria are satisfied.

notice by either party.
Compensation for loss of office
There are no predetermined special provisions for Executive or Non-executive Directors with regard to compensation in the
