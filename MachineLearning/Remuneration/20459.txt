 Remuneration Report
This report sets out the Group's policy on executive
remuneration with details of Directors' earnings and pension
entitlements and fees paid to non-executive Directors in
2003. Directors' interests in shares, share incentive awards
and share options, all of which are beneficial except as noted,
are set out on pages 24 and 25.
The Board has implemented the regulations on Directors'
remuneration reporting contained in the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and has given full
consideration to the best practice provisions on Directors'
remuneration appended to the Financial Services Authority
Listing Rules. Accordingly, with effect from 2004 the following
policy changes are being introduced:
  Two separate committees, the Remuneration Committee
and the Nominations Committee, will replace the current
Remuneration and Appointments Committee. Terms 
of reference for both Committees are available on
www.avis-europe.com. 
  Share option arrangements are revised to comply with 
best practice.
Remuneration and Appointments Committee
The Remuneration and Appointments Committee is comprised
of non-executive Directors. During 2003 the members were:
  Sir Bob Reid (Chairman)
  Roland D'Ieteren
  Malcolm Miller
  Dr Axel von Ruedorffer
As explained on page 16 Roland D'Ieteren is not an independent
non-executive Director.
Scope of Remuneration and Appointments Committee
The Remuneration and Appointments Committee sets 
the policy on senior executive remuneration and reviews
remuneration packages for Directors and senior key
executives. The Committee is also responsible for the
structuring and allocation of the Group's share incentive
schemes. In addition to remuneration matters, the Committee
appoints Directors and key executives, approves major
organisational changes and monitors senior management
succession capabilities.
Appointments
Mark McCafferty resigned as Chief Executive and from the
main Board effective 1 November 2003. He has remained 
as an employee of the Group to assist with management
continuity and the transition to a new Chief Executive and 
will leave the Company by April 2004. The Committee asked
Alun Cathcart to assume the role of Interim Chief Executive,
with particular reference to 2004 business plans and until 
a permanent successor could be appointed and inducted 
into the Group. The Committee conducted an extensive
review of both internal and external candidates, and in
December announced the appointment of Murray Hennessy
who joins the Group in March 2004. He was selected due 
to his international top management experience in areas that
have particular relevance to the Group, including management
of multi-site consumer-facing international businesses,
franchise management, internet sales and strategic sourcing.
Kevin M Sheehan was appointed a non-executive Director
effective 26 February 2004. Directors' biographies appear 
on page 14.
As part of the Group's succession planning, the Committee
approved a number of internal senior management
appointments in Avis and to its newly acquired Budget 
Rent A Car business.
Advisers to the Remuneration and Appointments Committee
The Committee has access to relevant external advisers
appointed by the Company and during the year under 
review, external advice was received from Watson Wyatt LLP
(retirement benefit consultants) and New Bridge Street
Consultants LLP (executive remuneration consultants). 
No additional services were provided by the aforementioned
external advisers during the year except that Watson Wyatt
LLP act as actuary and adviser to the trustee of the Avis 
UK Pension Plan. Remuneration decisions were made on
recommendation and advice of the Group Personnel &
Corporate Affairs Director and Wally Taylor, consultant and
former non-executive Director, and access to remuneration
data provided by TPFC, Hay and IDL.
Directors' remuneration policy
Introduction
The executive pay policy for the following financial year and
subsequent financial years is designed to secure the skills
and experience the Group needs to meet its objectives and
satisfy shareholder expectations. In determining its policy, 
the Committee takes account of market practice, the 
Group's position relative to other companies and the pay 
and employment conditions of other Group employees.
Executive Directors' remuneration is designed to be
competitive in the marketplace and comprises salary, 
taxable benefits, an annual incentive plan and participation 
in the Group's share incentive and pension schemes. 
The performance related elements of the package, the 
annual incentive plan and share incentive schemes are
designed to provide a significant proportion of the total
remuneration package.
Total cash remuneration comprising base salary and annual
incentive bonus is designed to provide an upper quartile total
remuneration opportunity, while base salary, which is reviewed
annually, is benchmarked using general market external
surveys against the median of the appropriate marketplace.
Additional significant opportunities to contribute to and gain
reward from the Company's success over the longer term 
are provided through the Group's share incentive schemes.
Non-executive Directors' fees are positioned to attract non-
executives with broad business and commercial experience
and to be competitive in the marketplace. Policy is to pay 
an annual fee with further payment for additional Committee
chairmanship responsibilities. Non-executive Directors do 
not receive awards under the Company's share incentive
schemes, and they do not accrue benefits under the Group's
retirement benefit schemes.

Remuneration Report
The Group's policy relating to the remuneration and benefits of
executive and non-executive Directors is reviewed periodically
and the Remuneration and Appointments Committee will be
reviewing share incentive policy during 2004.
Salary and annual incentive bonus
Remuneration levels, including annual incentive bonus, are
established by reference to comprehensive market survey
information, performance and direct linkage of reward to
Group performance. Annual incentive bonuses have for 
many years been an important part of Avis Europe's culture
and are widely applied throughout the Group.
Annual incentive bonus plans for executive Directors and 
key senior management are based on achievement of 
pre-set targets approved by the Committee and relate 
directly to the annual profit plan approved by the Board.
Targets and performance measures are quantitative.
Achievement of on-target performance will result in payments 
of approximately 50% of annual salary for the Chief Executive
and 40% of annual salary for executive Directors with a
maximum award for exceptional performance of 87.5% 
and 70% respectively. The Remuneration and Appointments
Committee has absolute discretion to determine and vary
targets to reflect material changes. Bonus payments do not
form part of pensionable earnings for Directors.
The base salary, bonus payments and value of benefits in
kind for each Director are set out in table (a) on page 23.
Share incentive schemes
Share schemes are regarded as integral to the incentivisation
and reward of management and employees and are widely
applied across the Group. The Group operates a number of
schemes: a performance share plan, an equity partnership
plan, and approved and unapproved share option schemes,
and has shareholder approval for an all employee share
incentive plan.
Taking into account investor views, the Remuneration and
Appointments Committee concluded that the share option
schemes should be amended to bring them in line with best
practice, as set out below.
Performance Share Plan
The Performance Share Plan, approved at the Annual General
Meeting in 2000, is a seven-year plan, designed to encourage
executive focus on longer term performance and growth 
in shareholder value. Awards are determined by the
Remuneration and Appointments Committee and will not
normally be greater than 100% of the qualifying participant's
total annual remuneration measured at the date of the award.
All awards under this Plan to date have been based on 50%
of total annual remuneration. No participant has received 
an award under the Company's share option schemes in the
same year as an award under the Performance Share Plan.
These awards will vest over a period of seven years from 
the date of the award. The extent to which an award vests 
is determined by the Group's medium and long-term
performance measured in terms of total shareholder return
(TSR). TSR is measured against a broad comparator group
from the Transport and Support Services sectors as Avis is 
a service company classified in the Transport sector. For the
awards to vest, TSR at the end of each performance period
must be at least at the median in relation to the comparator
group and there has to be a minimum real increase in EPS 
of 3% per annum over the seven-year period.
If both these conditions are met, 50% of the award may vest.
For full vesting the EPS target must be met and the Group's
TSR must be in the top quartile of the comparator group over
the seven-year period. TSR achievement between the median
and 75th percentile will result in vesting between 50% and
100% of the award on a pro rata basis.
If the performance conditions are met at the third and fifth
anniversary of the date of award, vesting will accelerate to 
the extent of 25% of the award on each of these occasions.
The comparator group for TSR currently comprises the
companies listed below:
Arena Leisure plc
Arriva plc
Associated British Ports Holdings plc
Christian Salvesen plc
Eurotunnel plc/Eurotunnel SA
First Choice Holidays plc
First Group plc
Go Ahead Group plc
Minorplanet Systems plc
Mitie Group plc
MyTravel Group plc
National Express Group plc
RAC plc
Stagecoach Holdings plc
TBI plc
Tibbett & Britten Group plc
A combination of performance targets was chosen for 
the measurement of the Company's performance since 
TSR aligns the interests of executives with shareholders 
by requiring superior total shareholder return performance
and EPS requires real improvement in financial performance
of the Company. The assessment of whether performance
conditions have been met will be independently reviewed 
by the external auditors and verified by the Remuneration 
and Appointments Committee at the time of vesting.
Share option schemes
Over 435 employees throughout the Group, including the
executive Directors, have been granted options under the
Company's Inland Revenue approved and unapproved 
share option schemes. Employees may not normally 
exercise options earlier than three years nor more than 
ten years after the grant (seven years for grants made 
before April 2000 for the unapproved scheme). At the 
2000 Annual General Meeting, shareholder approval was
sought to operate the schemes on an annual grant basis with
the facility to make grants to individuals up to a maximum of
200% of annual remuneration per annum. Options may only be exercised upon the satisfaction of
objective performance requirements established at the 
date of grant which are EPS based. For options granted 
to date real growth in EPS must exceed 3% per annum 
over any three-year period for any of the options to 
become exercisable. The Remuneration and Appointments
Committee, having regard to the views and best interests 
of the Company's shareholders has decided that for future
option grants there will be no opportunity to retest the
performance condition if it is not met over the initial three-
year performance period, and that challenging EPS targets
which take into account the Company's circumstances will 
be set for future grants.
An EPS condition was considered appropriate as it requires
improvement in the underlying financial performance before
options can be exercised.
The Rules of the share option schemes limit the number 
of options that can be granted over new issue shares in a
rolling ten-year period to 5% of issued share capital under
discretionary share schemes, and 10% of issued share
capital under all share schemes. The total number of share
options granted at 31 December 2003 is well within these
dilution limits.
Equity Partnership Plan
The Equity Partnership Plan, approved at the Annual 
General Meeting in 2000, was designed to encourage senior
management throughout the Group to retain a shareholding 
in the Company over a period of time. Participants may invest
part of their annual bonus to acquire shares in the Company
and in return an award will be granted by the Company over
additional shares calculated as a proportion of the amount
invested. The conditions are that participants remain employed
by the Group for a specified period, retain the shares they
have acquired throughout the period and that the Group
achieves EPS increase in real terms of 3% per annum over
the three-year period commencing with the year in which the
award is granted.
A one-off Loyalty share award was made in 2000 to over 
80 of the senior management group including the executive
Directors, to encourage share retention. The number of 
shares awarded was 25% of the shares held under options
granted at the flotation of the Company or commencement 
of employment, if later. These awards vest in three equal
instalments on the sixth, seventh and eighth anniversary of
the date of the grant of the qualifying option, provided that
the participant has not disposed of more than one-third of 
the shares under that option in respect of each of the three
years following the third anniversary of grant of option.
If these conditions are met the Loyalty share award will only
vest if the performance condition attached to the qualifying
option has been achieved, which is a minimum real increase
in EPS of 3% per annum over any three-year period. During
2003 the first instalment of Loyalty share awards relating to
options granted in 1997 vested.
Avis Europe Employee Share Trust
The Avis Europe Employee Share Trust was established 
in March 2000 to facilitate provision of shares for the
Company's share incentive schemes. The Trust may hold up
to 5% of the issued share capital of the Company at any one
time. During 2003, no additional shares were acquired by the
Trust and the number of shares drawn down during the period
was 225,857, of which 208,807 related to the first release of
Loyalty Share awards. At 31 December 2003, the Trust held
749,017 shares, excluding shares which were purchased from
bonuses by participants in the Partnership share award.
The graph below illustrates the performance of Avis Europe
plc and a broad equity market index  over the past five
years. As Avis Europe plc has been a constituent of the 
FTSE 350 index throughout this five-year period, that index 
is considered the most appropriate form of broad equity
market index  against which the Group's performance 
should be graphed. Performance, as required by legislation,
is measured by total shareholder return (share price plus
dividends paid).

Directors' engagement policy
Executive Directors
The Company's policy is to issue each executive Director with
a service contract which is subject to 12 months' notice on
either side and runs until terminated. The contract provides
for salary to be paid for any unexpired period of notice in 
the event of termination by the Company. Any such payment
would be discounted in line with the mitigation obligations 
of the departing Director. There are no special contractual
payments associated with change of control.
All current Directors have service contracts in line with policy
and dated as shown:
Alun Cathcart 1 May 2002
Lesley Colyer 18 April 2002
Martyn Smith 11 September 2002
Dieter Woitscheck 8 January 2001
The Board believes that it can be of benefit to Avis if its
executive Directors serve as non-executive Directors of 
other companies, and, subject to individual review, the
general policy is that an executive Director may hold one 
non-executive directorship with another company and may
retain the fees therefrom.
Non-executive Directors
The Company's policy is to engage non-executive Directors
on renewable three-year terms but which can be terminated
by either party at any time without penalty. Non-executive
Directors normally retire at the Annual General Meeting
following their 70th birthday.
All non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, have
letters of appointment in accordance with policy. The Board
sets the remuneration of non-executive Directors.
Retirement benefits
Alun Cathcart, Lesley Colyer and Martyn Smith are members
of the Avis UK Pension Plan. In addition, Martyn Smith
receives a taxable supplement of cash remuneration towards
pension provision. Dieter Woitscheck remains a member of
the Avis Germany pension plan.

No annual incentive bonus was paid for financial year 2002 to Directors. In December 2002, the Remuneration and Appointments Committee approved
an incentive plan and targets for 2003 based on normal business circumstances. The Committee also approved at that time a review of targets for all
incentive schemes across the Group in the event of conflict in Iraq. Accordingly, targets were reset in June 2003 based on revised market forecasts. 
M McCafferty's bonus payment includes a special award in recognition of his leadership of the Budget integration process.

M McCafferty resigned from the Board on 1 November 2003. The  195,507 is the remuneration due to M McCafferty following his resignation as a
