 26 Avis Europe plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and the relevant
requirements of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority. The
Board has given full consideration to the best practice provisions 
on Directors' remuneration as set out in the new Combined Code.
As required by the Remuneration Report Regulations, a resolution
to approve the Directors' Remuneration Report will be proposed 
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company at
which the Financial Statements will be approved. The vote will have
advisory status, will be in respect of the remuneration policy and
overall remuneration packages and will not be specific to individual
levels of remuneration.
Part 1 of this report sets out the Group's policy on executive
remuneration and explains the various elements of the Directors'
remuneration packages. Part 2 of this report, which contains 
the information on which auditors are required to report to the
Company's shareholders, sets out details of Directors' earnings 
and pension entitlements and fees paid to non-executive Directors
in 2004. Directors' interests in shares, share incentive awards and
share options, all of which are beneficial except as noted, are set
out on pages 32 and 33.
Part 1
Remuneration Committee
Scope
The Remuneration Committee determines broad policy on senior
executive remuneration and terms of service and approves specific
terms of appointment for the Chairman, executive Directors and
senior management. The Committee is also responsible for the
structuring and allocation of the Group's share incentive schemes.
The full terms of reference are available on www.avis-europe.com
During 2004 the Committee's activities included:
  approval of terms of appointment for Alun Cathcart, Murray
Hennessy, Simon Palethorpe and a number of senior managers
across the Group;
  review of market data and individual performance to determine
salary increases for Directors and senior managers;
  review and revision of the performance conditions of the share
option schemes and the performance share plan to comply with
best practice;
  review of proposed pension simplification legislation and
agreement on an initial policy approach;
  approval of a special three-year share retention award for the
Chief Executive; and
  approval of revisions to the annual bonus scheme for 2005.
Membership 
The Remuneration Committee is comprised of non-executive
Directors. Members as at 21 March 2005 are:
Malcolm Miller (Chairman) 
Les Cullen 
Roland D'Ieteren
Dr Axel von Ruedorffer
As noted on page 21 of the Corporate Governance Report, a
separate Remuneration Committee was formed on 26 February
2004 to replace the Remuneration and Appointments Committee
which exercised all the relevant functions up to that date. As at
1January 2004, the members of the Remuneration and Appointments
Committee were Sir Bob Reid (retired 25 May 2004), Roland
D'Ieteren, Malcolm Miller and Axel von Ruedorffer and the initial
membership of the Remuneration Committee was the same. Les
Cullen joined the Committee on his appointment as a Director on
25 May 2004 and Alun Cathcart was appointed interim Chairman of
the Committee at the same date. He resigned from the Committee
on 1 June 2004 when Malcolm Miller assumed the chairmanship of
this Committee.
The Committee is comprised of independent non-executive Directors,
with the exception of Roland D'Ieteren, as explained on page 21 of
the Corporate Governance Report.
Advisers
External advice was received from New Bridge Street Consultants
LLP (executive remuneration consultants) in respect of the Group's
incentive schemes and Watson Wyatt LLP (retirement benefit
consultants) in respect of pension simplification legislation. 
Watson Wyatt LLP act as actuary and adviser to the trustee of the
Avis UK Pension Plan. Remuneration decisions were made on the
recommendation and advice of the Chairman, the Chief Executive,
the Group Personnel & Corporate Affairs Director (save in respect 
of their own remuneration) and Wally Taylor, consultant and former
non-executive Director. The Committee had access to remuneration
data provided by Hay, IDL, Monks Partnership (a trading name of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP), New Bridge Street Consultants LLP
and Towers Perrin. Other than described above, no additional
services were provided by the external advisers during the year.
Remuneration policy
Introduction 
The Group's policy relating to the remuneration and benefits of
executive and non-executive Directors is reviewed periodically. 
The executive pay policy for 2005 and subsequent financial years 
is designed to secure the skills and experience the Group needs 
to meet its objectives and satisfy shareholder expectations. In
determining its policy, the Committee takes account of market
practice, the Group's position relative to other companies and 
the pay and employment conditions of other Group employees.
In light of recent trading announcements and the strategic review
which is currently under way, the Committee has decided that, 
for 2005 only, the remuneration policy should be amended. Since
developing the Company's strategic recovery plan and achieving
stretching performance milestones in 2005 is key to the Company's
future, the Committee believes that it is imperative that the executive
Directors are focused on delivering the short-term targets set out in
the plan. In addition, the Committee believes that the Company's
current circumstances make it inappropriate to make any new awards
under the Company's existing long-term incentive arrangements.
Accordingly, for 2005 the Committee has decided not to award 
any share incentive awards under the long-term share incentive
schemes. Instead, in recognising the importance of the strategic
recovery plan, the Committee has decided to increase the annual
bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director
and Group Commercial Director. The measure of performance will
be based on the development of the Company's recovery strategy,
the achievement of specific performance milestones, and the
achievement of the financial plan for 2005. Under this scheme 
half of any bonus payable will be paid in the normal way, with 
the remaining half deferred for a year provided that the recipient 
is still employed at that time and no notice has been served.
Remuneration Report Avis Europe plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 27
During 2005, following the development of the Company's strategic
recovery plan, the Committee will review the remuneration policy for
2006 onwards in the context of the Company's long-term strategy. 
It is intended that the executive Directors'* remuneration will comprise
salary, taxable benefits**, an annual incentive plan and participation
in long-term share incentive and pension schemes. It is anticipated
that the long-term share incentive schemes used to remunerate
senior executives will be revised following the review to ensure that
they are appropriate to the Company's circumstances and reflect
market practice and investor guidelines at that time. Variable
remuneration will form a significant element of total remuneration.
*Other than Jean-Pierre Bizet, executive Deputy Chairman, who receives an
annual fee for his services and does not participate in the Group's bonus,
share or pension plans.
**See page 31 for a description of taxable benefits.
Salary
The policy on base salary is to benchmark using general market
external surveys against the median of similar sized companies
relevant to the appropriate marketplace. In considering whether 
to make any increase to base salaries, the Committee takes into
account the performance of individual executives and the general
increases for employees across the Group. 
Annual incentive bonus
Annual incentive bonuses have for many years been an important part
of Avis Europe's culture and are widely applied throughout the Group.
Annual incentive bonus plans for executive Directors and key senior
management have been based on achievement of pre-set targets
approved by the Committee and related directly to the annual profit
plan approved by the Board. Targets and performance measures
were quantitative and there was a threshold below which no bonus
payment was made. Normally, achievement of on-target performance
results in payments of approximately 50% of annual salary for 
the Chief Executive and 40% of annual salary for other executive
Directors, with a maximum award for exceptional performance of
87.5% and 70% respectively. 
The Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and the Group Personnel
and Corporate Affairs Director received bonus awards in 2004 under
the Group's annual incentive plan. The target for the 2004 incentive
plan set by the Remuneration Committee in December 2003 was
based on achieving Group profit on ordinary activities before
amortisation of goodwill and net exceptional items of  56.9 million.
This was later reduced by  3 million, to take account of the strategic
investment in the Company's development subsequently approved
by the Board and announced with the Company's interim results in
September 2004. The result for 2004 was  54.2 million and on this
basis the Committee awarded payments at the target level to all
participants in the Group incentive scheme, including the three
executive Directors eligible to participate.
As mentioned in the policy section above, for 2005 only, the Committee
has decided to increase the maximum award under the annual
incentive bonus plan to 175% of salary for the Chief Executive and
140% for the Group Finance and Commercial Directors (the maxima
will remain unchanged for other executive Directors). The payment
of this bonus will be dependent on exceptional performance in
delivering the targets required in the Company's recovery strategy,
in addition to achieving the financial plan approved by the Board 
for 2005. 50% of total incentive earnings for 2005 will be payable 
in the normal way after the end of the year, with the remaining 50%
payable on the first anniversary of the initial payment, provided the
recipient is still employed at that time and no notice has been given.
This temporary change in policy reflects the need to retain and
motivate senior management during the current period of significant
change, recognising the decision to delay long-term incentive
awards until 2006 once a full incentive review has been performed.
The base salary, bonus payments and value of benefits in kind for
each Director are set out in table (a) on page 31. Bonus payments,
benefits in kind and cash allowances do not form part of pensionable
earnings for Directors.
Share incentive policy
The Company currently operates three share incentive schemes: 
the Performance Share Plan, the Inland Revenue Approved Share
Option Scheme and the Unapproved Share Option Scheme. The
Company also has an Equity Partnership Plan and shareholder
approval for an all employee share plan. However, neither of these
plans is active.
As noted on page 26, no incentive awards will be made under the
Performance Share Plan or the Share Option Schemes in 2005. 
A full review of long-term incentives will be performed in 2005 to
ensure that the arrangements put in place are in line with the key
objectives and anticipated outcomes of the new strategy. At this
time, the Committee will also consider the requirement for a Directors'
shareholding policy.
It has been the Company's general intention that no participant
should receive an award under both the Performance Share Plan
and Share Option Schemes in the same year. However, during the
year, as an exception to this general policy (and in accordance with
section 13.13A(b) of the Listing Rules) to facilitate the recruitment 
of the new Chief Executive, the Remuneration Committee believed 
it should grant share options and performance shares at the same
time. He received an award under each plan over shares worth
approximately 100% of his base salary. Further details of these
awards are set out below. Subsequently in December 2004 the
Committee made a share retention award to the Chief Executive
pursuant to section 13.13A(b). Further details of the award are set
out below.
The performance conditions for each of the schemes are set out
below including both prior years and those applied during 2004. 
The assessment of whether performance conditions have been 
met is independently reviewed by the external auditors and verified
by the Committee at the time of vesting.
Given the increased volatility that arises when reporting earnings 
on the basis of International Financial Reporting Standards, where
earnings per share is included as a measurement in the performance
conditions of a plan, it is the intention of the management to continue
in the short to medium-term to assess performance for awards
made to date on the basis of existing UK GAAP to ensure that
performance is measured on a consistent basis.
Individual Directors' share incentive awards are set out on page 33.
Performance Share Plan
The Performance Share Plan is a seven-year plan, designed to
encourage executive focus on longer term performance and growth
in shareholder value. A combination of performance targets was
chosen for the measurement of the Company's performance since
total shareholder return (TSR) aligns the interests of executives with
shareholders by requiring median or above total shareholder return 28 Avis Europe plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004
performance and earnings per share (EPS) requires real
improvement in financial performance of the Company.
Awards are determined by the Committee and may not be greater
than 100% of the qualifying participant's total annual remuneration
measured at the date of the award. No award granted to date 
has exceeded one times annual salary. Awards vest over a period 
of seven years from the date of the award. If the performance
conditions are met at the third and fifth anniversary of the date 
of award, vesting accelerates to the extent of 25% of the award 
on each of these occasions. The extent to which an award vests 
is determined by the Group's medium and long-term performance
measured in terms of TSR. TSR is measured against a broad
comparator group from the Transport and Support Services sectors,
as Avis is a service company classified in the Transport sector. 
In 2004 the comparator group was changed to reflect a more
comparable peer group taking into account the circumstances 
of the Company. The revised comparator group includes a greater
focus on travel orientated and international companies.
For the awards to vest, TSR at the end of each performance period
must be at least at the median in relation to the comparator group
and there has to be a minimum real increase in EPS of 3% per
annum over the relevant period.
For awards made prior to 2004, if both these conditions are met
50% of the award may vest. For full vesting the EPS target must 
be met and the Group's TSR must be in the top quartile of the
comparator group over the seven-year period. TSR achievement
between the median and 75th percentile will result in vesting
between 50% and 100% of the award on a pro rata basis.
The comparator group for TSR for awards made prior to 2003
comprises the companies listed below:
Airtours plc Mitie Group plc
Arena Leisure plc National Express Group plc
Arriva plc NFC plc
Associated British Ports Holdings plc Ocean Group plc
Eurotunnel plc/Eurotunnel SA Powell Duffryn plc
First Choice Holidays plc Christian Salvesen plc
First Group plc Stagecoach Holdings plc
Go-Ahead Group plc TBI plc
Lex Service plc Thomson Travel Group plc
Minorplanet Systems plc Tibbett & Britten Group plc
The comparator group for TSR for awards made in 2003 comprises
the companies listed below: 
Arena Leisure plc Mitie Group plc
Arriva plc MyTravel Group plc
Associated British Ports Holdings plc National Express Group plc
Eurotunnel plc/Eurotunnel SA RAC plc
First Choice Holidays plc Christian Salvesen plc
First Group plc Stagecoach Holdings plc
Go-Ahead Group plc TBI plc
Minorplanet Systems plc Tibbett & Britten Group plc
On change of control the Committee will take into account the
performance conditions when determining the vesting of awards.
The only award made under the Plan in 2004 was to the new Chief
Executive following his recruitment. His award was over 490,266
shares, worth approximately 100% of his annual rate of salary. These
shares will vest on 2 April 2011 provided he remains in employment
and to the extent the performance conditions have been satisfied.
The performance conditions for his award are different from the
conditions previously applied to awards in the following respects:
  only 30% of the award will vest for median performance; and
  the comparator group comprises the following companies:
Accor Holidaybreak plc
Air France Intercontinental Hotels Group plc
Alpha Airports Group plc Kuoni Reisen Holding AG
BAA plc Deutsche Lufthansa AG
British Airways plc Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc
Carnival plc NH Hoteles SA
easyJet plc P&O Steam Navigation Company
Eurotunnel plc Ryanair Holdings plc
First Choice Holidays plc Sixt AG
First Group plc TBI plc
Hilton Group plc TUI AG
The other terms of the award are the same as for other awards
made under the Performance Share Plan.
Share option schemes
The Group operates Inland Revenue approved and unapproved
share option schemes which have an EPS based performance
condition. An EPS condition is considered appropriate, as it 
requires improvement in the underlying financial performance
before options can be exercised. Employees may not normally
exercise options earlier than three years nor more than ten years
after the grant (seven years for grants made before April 2000 for
the unapproved scheme). Options will lapse upon cessation of
employment. However, special conditions apply if employment
ceases because of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement
or because the employing business or company is transferred outside
the Group, or for any other reason at the discretion of the Board.
In 2004, the Committee imposed more demanding performance
conditions having regard to the views and best interests of the
Company's shareholders. Options will be fully exercisable only 
if the real growth in EPS during the three-year period 2004-2006
exceeds 10% per annum compound. For 30% of the options to be
exercisable there must be real minimum growth of 5% per annum
compound. Vesting will be on a straight line basis for EPS growth
between these targets. There will be no opportunity to retest the
performance condition if it is not met over the specified three-year
performance period. On change of control, the Committee will take
into account performance when determining the vesting of awards.
Options granted prior to 2004 become exercisable when real growth
in EPS exceeds 3% per annum during any period of three consecutive
years following the date of grant.
The rules of the share option schemes limit the number of options
that can be granted over new issue shares in a rolling ten-year
period to 5% of issued share capital under discretionary share
schemes, and 10% of issued share capital under all share schemes.
The total number of share options granted at 31 December 2004 is
well within these dilution limits.
The Directors' entitlements under these schemes are set out in
table (c) on page 32.
Equity Partnership Plan
The Equity Partnership Plan was designed to encourage senior
management throughout the Group to retain a shareholding in the
Company over a period of time. However, no awards have been
made under this Plan since 2002 and the continuation of this plan 
Remuneration Report Avis Europe plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 29
is under consideration as part of the overall review of long-term
incentive arrangements going forward. The plan has two components:
the Partnership share award and the Loyalty share award.
Partnership share award
The Committee could invite participants to invest part of their
annual bonus to acquire shares in the Company and in return an
award would be granted by the Company over additional shares
calculated as a proportion of the amount invested. The conditions
were that participants remained employed by the Group for a
specified period, retained the shares they had acquired throughout
the period and that the Group achieved EPS increase in real terms
of 3% per annum over the three-year period commencing with the
year in which the award was granted.
Loyalty share award
A one-off Loyalty share award was made in 2000 to over 80 senior
managers including the executive Directors, to encourage share
retention. The number of shares awarded was 25% of the shares
held under options granted at the flotation of the Company or
commencement of employment, if later. These awards vest in three
equal instalments on the sixth, seventh and eighth anniversary of
the date of the grant of the qualifying option, provided that the
participant has not disposed of more than one-third of the shares
under that option in respect of each of the three years following the
third anniversary of grant of option. 
If these conditions are met the Loyalty share award will only vest 
if the performance condition attached to the qualifying option has
been achieved, which is a minimum real increase in EPS of 3% per
annum during any period of three consecutive years following the
date of grant. During 2004 the second instalment of Loyalty share
awards relating to options granted in 1997 vested.
Share Retention Plan
On 21 December 2004 a Share Retention Plan was established as 
a discretionary benefit for the purposes of retaining the services of
the Chief Executive. The Plan was implemented without shareholder
approval by virtue of paragraph 13.13A(b) of the Listing Rules
published by the UKLA. The Committee views the contribution of
the new Chief Executive to the development and implementation of
the Group's recovery strategy as essential and therefore determined
that it was appropriate to implement this plan to facilitate his retention
over the medium-term.
The principal terms of the Plan are as follows. The sole participant 
is the Chief Executive and the conditional award is in the form of a
nil cost option to acquire ordinary shares in the Company. In normal
circumstances the option will vest in three equal tranches (the total
award being 600,000 options) at 1 January 2006, 1 January 2007
and 1 January 2008, provided that he is still employed by the 
Group and is not subject to notice of termination of his employment
(whether given or received) on these dates. There are no performance
conditions relating to this award. The option is exercisable within
three months of vesting (twelve months in the case of death and
one month in the case of takeover). Benefits provided under the
Plan are not pensionable.
The award will normally lapse on cessation of employment (save 
on death when the award will vest in full). If employment ceases 
by reason of injury or disability, or for any other reason if the
Remuneration Committee so decides, the Remuneration Committee
has the discretion to decide whether or not the option will vest and,
if so, the extent to which it will vest. In the event of a takeover, the
Remuneration Committee will decide the extent to which any
outstanding part of the award will vest. In the event of a corporate
reorganisation, the Remuneration Committee may decide that the
award continues over the shares of any new holding company.
If there is a de-merger or other corporate event, which in the
opinion of the Remuneration Committee will materially affect the
share price, then the Remuneration Committee may decide that 
the award vests early. In the event of any increase or variation in 
the share capital of the Company, the payment of a capital dividend
or other events similarly affecting the award, the number of shares
subject to the award may be adjusted. The Remuneration Committee
may alter the Plan at any time. 
Avis Europe Employee Share Trust
The Avis Europe Employee Share Trust was established in March
2000 to facilitate provision of shares for the Company's share
incentive schemes. The Trust may hold up to 5% of the issued share
capital of the Company at any one time. During 2004, no additional
shares were acquired by the Trust and the number of shares drawn
down during the period was 167,922, of which 159,671 related to
the second release of Loyalty share awards. 
At 31 December 2004, the Trust held 581,095 shares, excluding
shares which were purchased from bonuses by participants in the
Equity Partnership Plan. It is intended that the shares in the Trust
will be used to satisfy conditional share awards made under the
Performance Share Plan, Share Retention Plan and Equity
Partnership Plan as and when these awards vest. The awards
outstanding under each of these Plans at 31 December 2003 and
31 December 2004 are as follows:
Conditional share Conditional share 
awards outstanding at awards outstanding at 
Share Incentive Scheme 31 December 2003 31 December 2004
Performance Share Plan 1,007,153 shares 1,238,868 shares
Equity Partnership Plan
- Partnership shares 8,546 shares 5,474 shares
- Loyalty shares 483,518 shares 217,180 shares
Share Retention Plan - 600,000 shares
Total 1,499,217 shares 2,061,522 shares
The Company periodically reviews the number of shares held by the
Employee Share Trust in light of the anticipated vesting dates and
performance conditions under the various plans. The Company also
regularly reviews its hedging policy but does not currently hedge
any of these awards against potential Social Security costs that
may be incurred across the Group as and when the awards vest.
Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
The following graph illustrates the performance of Avis Europe plc
and a broad equity market index  over the past five years. As 
Avis Europe plc has been a constituent of the FTSE 350 index
throughout this five-year period, that index is considered the most
appropriate form of broad equity market index  against which the
Group's performance should be graphed. Performance, as required
by legislation, is measured by total shareholder return (share price
plus dividends paid). 30 Avis Europe plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004
Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors' fees are positioned to attract non-executives
with broad business and commercial experience and to be
competitive in the marketplace. The Chairman's fee is determined
by the Remuneration Committee. The Chairman and the Chief
Executive set the remuneration of non-executive Directors based 
on periodic review of current survey data. Policy is to pay an annual
fee with further payment for additional Committee chairmanship
responsibilities. Non-executive Directors do not receive awards
under the Company's share incentive schemes.
Engagement policy
Executive Directors
The Company's policy is to issue each executive Director with a
service contract which is subject to 12 months' notice on either 
side and runs until terminated. The contract provides for salary to
be paid for any unexpired period of notice in the event of termination
by the Company. Any such payment would be discounted in line
with the mitigation obligations of the departing Director. There are
no special contractual payments associated with change of control.
All current executive Directors have service contracts in line with
policy as shown:
Date of service contract Notice period
Jean-Pierre Bizet* 25 May 2004 12 months
Lesley Colyer 18 April 2002 12 months
Murray Hennessy 17 May 2004 12 months
Simon Palethorpe 5 October 2004 12 months
Martyn Smith 11 September 2002 12 months
*Subject to the terms of the Relationship Agreement in respect of Directors
appointed by s.a. D'Ieteren n.v.
The Board believes that it can be of benefit to Avis if its executive
Directors serve as non-executive Directors of other companies, and,
subject to individual review, the general policy is that an executive
Director may hold one non-executive directorship with another
company and may retain the fees therefrom. Murray Hennessy
holds a non-executive directorship and donates his fee to charity.
Until October 2004, Martyn Smith held a non-executive directorship
with a charitable organisation for which he received no fees. Simon
Palethorpe holds a directorship with a government body for which
his fees are up to a maximum of  10,000 per annum.

Non-executive Directors
The Company's policy is to engage non-executive Directors on
renewable three-year terms but which can be terminated by 
either party at any time without penalty (subject to the terms 
of the Relationship Agreement in respect of Directors appointed 
by s.a. D'Ieteren n.v.). Non-executive Directors are required to 
offer themselves for election at the next Annual General Meeting
following their appointment and thereafter for re-election every 
three years. They normally retire at the Annual General Meeting
following their 70th birthday.

as a non-executive Director from 1 April 1999 to 30 April 2002. Gilbert van
Marcke de Lummen served as an executive Director from 3 February 1997 
to 30 April 2002.
All non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, have letters 
of appointment in accordance with policy. 
Retirement benefits
The executive Directors are, like other employees, eligible for
membership of the Avis UK Pension Plan. This Plan is a defined
benefit Plan and comprises two sections: the non-contributory Final
Salary section which was closed to new entrants from 1 July 2003,
and the contributory Retirement Capital section which is open to
new members from the same date. Alun Cathcart, Lesley Colyer
and Martyn Smith are members of the Final Salary section and,
after at least 20 years' service, their retirement pension at normal
retirement date will be two-thirds of Final Pensionable Salary,
inclusive of any benefits retained in other pension schemes prior to
joining Avis. Murray Hennessy and Simon Palethorpe are members
of the Retirement Capital section, under which an allocation of 25%
of their pensionable salary is made to a notional account. Each year
the account balance is revalued by inflation up to 10% although the
Company may at its absolute discretion and subject to actuarial
advice apply a greater rate of revaluation. At retirement the balance
in the account will be used to purchase an annuity. Pensionable
salary for all executive Directors excludes bonus payments, taxable
benefits and cash allowances. For Murray Hennessy, Simon Palethorpe
and Martyn Smith pensionable salary is restricted to the level of the
Inland Revenue earnings cap and they each receive a taxable cash
allowance of 20% of base salary above the earnings cap.
The Committee is currently reviewing the impact of the forthcoming
Inland Revenue legislation relating to tax-favoured retirement
provision (pensions simplification ), pending publication of the final
Regulations. The Committee intends that any measures taken will
be broadly cost neutral in order to avoid increasing the Company's
pension liabilities as a result of this legislation. The Company is not
responsible for compensating individuals for changes in personal
tax liabilities arising from the legislation.

The figures above relate to D Woitscheck's benefits calculated at 31 December 2004 under the Avis Germany Pension Plan. Exchange rate of  1.44362 to  1 
is used for translation purposes. Murray Hennessy and Simon Palethorpe are members of the Retirement Capital section of the Avis UK Pension Plan. This is a cash balance 
arrangement to which the Directors and the Company contribute. Each year an amount equal to 25% of salary up to the Inland Revenue
earnings cap is credited to a notional account. At 1 April each year after the first year, the account balance is revalued by the rate of inflation
over the preceding calendar year, subject to a maximum of 10%. The Company may at its absolute discretion and subject to actuarial advice
apply a greater rate of revaluation. At retirement the account will have been built up from each year's annual credit plus the annual revaluation
amount, and the balance in the account will be used to purchase an annuity on behalf of the Director. In the year to 31 December 2004, the
value of the Company's contributions for Murray Hennessy was  17,105 (2003: nil) and for Simon Palethorpe was  1,648 (2003: nil).
(c) Directors' interests in shares and share options granted under the Avis Europe plc share option schemes, all of which are beneficial
except as noted, are shown below. No options were exercised during the period under review or the previous year. All options were granted
for nil consideration. There have been no changes in options between 31 December 2004 and 21 March 2005 other than Dieter Woitscheck's
