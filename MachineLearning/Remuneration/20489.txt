Remuneration policy
Introduction
The Group's policy relating to the remuneration and benefits of
executive and non-executive Directors is reviewed periodically. 
The executive remuneration policy for 2006 is designed to secure
the skills and experience the Group needs to meet its objectives
and satisfy shareholder expectations. In general, in determining 
its policy, the Remuneration Committee takes account of market
practice, the Group's position relative to other companies and 
the pay and employment conditions of other Group employees.
Avis Europe continues to execute a multi-phase strategy to 
grow margins by between 3-5% over the next three years and 
to restore profitable growth. This includes a shift in business mix
towards more profitable customer segments and a very significant
restructuring to drive effectiveness and efficiency and deliver annual
cost savings of some  30 million by 2008.
To build the initial momentum of the recovery strategy, the
Remuneration Committee decided in 2005 to focus executive 
reward on delivering key short-term targets. No long-term incentive
awards were made. Instead, maximum annual bonus opportunities
were increased for the Chief Executive and two executive Directors
respectively, with half deferred for one year. 
During 2005, the Remuneration Committee carried out a full review
of executive remuneration for the newly formed Avis Executive
Board which comprises 11 senior managers from across the Group,
including the executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee 
has decided to freeze salaries for the three-year turnaround period.
2006 is the critical turnaround year in the recovery process and 
to maintain momentum on delivering challenging short-term targets
(particularly the cost and effectiveness savings associated with 
the restructuring programme), the Remuneration Committee has
decided to enhance the annual bonus opportunities for 2006 and
make no long-term incentive awards during the year. However, the
Remuneration Committee fully expects to introduce new long-term
incentives in 2007 that are aligned to shareholders' interests and the
Company's circumstances at that time. In addition, the Remuneration
Committee is introducing shareholding guidelines that require
executive Directors to build up their personal holdings of shares 
in Avis Europe to align their interests with those of shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee tries to ensure that a significant
proportion of total executive remuneration is performance related.
For 2006, one-third of remuneration will be fixed and two-thirds
variable at maximum performance.
Salary
The policy on base salary up to and including 2005 was to
benchmark using general market external surveys against the
median of similar sized companies relevant to the appropriate
marketplace. In considering whether to make any increase to 
base salaries, the Remuneration Committee takes into account the
performance of individual executives and the general increases for Remuneration Report continued
26 Avis Europe plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2005
employees across the Group. From 2006 to 2009 (the period of 
the Group's turnaround plan) executive and senior management
salaries will be frozen. It is anticipated that from 2009 onwards base
salaries will be below the market median, with short and long-term
incentives providing competitive total remuneration aligned to
delivery of results.
Annual incentive bonus
Annual incentive bonus plans for executive Directors and key 
senior management have been based on achievement of targets
approved by the Remuneration Committee and related directly 
to the annual profit plan approved by the Board. Targets and
performance measures were quantitative and there was a threshold
below which no bonus payment was made. 
In 2005, the Remuneration Committee increased the maximum
award under the annual incentive bonus plan to 175% of salary 
for the Chief Executive and 140% for the Group Finance and
Commercial Directors. Bonus payment was dependent on delivery
of the Company's recovery strategy in addition to achieving the
2005 Board approved financial plan. All executive Directors qualified
for payment under the 2005 annual incentive bonus plan at varying
levels, dependent on each individual Director's delivery of specific
recovery plan milestones. Executive Directors also received a bonus
relating to the financial plan which exceeded target. For the Chief
Executive, Group Commercial Director and Group Finance Director,
50% of annual incentive bonus earned will be payable after the end
of the year, with the remaining 50% deferred and payable on the
first anniversary of the initial payment, provided the recipient is still
employed at that time and no notice has been given.
For 2006, the Remuneration Committee intends to increase maximum
bonus opportunities to 200% of salary for the Avis Executive Board,
100% of salary for on-target performance. Although these levels are
above typical market levels, the Remuneration Committee considers
them appropriate as no long-term incentive will be awarded and
salaries are frozen. 50% of the incentive will be based on stretching
financial targets aligned to the recovery road map with 50% based
on specific recovery plan objectives, notably restructuring savings
and profitable growth in the chosen customer segments. 
50% of any bonus earned will be paid in cash and 50% will be
deferred into Avis shares and released, subject to continued
employment, after a further year. The deferral is intended to align
the interests of executives with shareholders, encourage share
ownership and aid retention. 
The base salary, bonus payments and value of benefits in kind 
for each Director are set out in table (a) on page 30. Bonus
payments, benefits in kind and cash allowances do not form 
part of pensionable earnings for Directors.
Share incentive policy
The Remuneration Committee undertook a review of the Company's
share schemes during 2005. As mentioned above no awards were
made in 2005 and this policy has been extended to 2006. The
Remuneration Committee plans to introduce new long-term
incentives for the Avis Executive Board in 2007 that are aligned to
the Group's recovery targets and shareholder interests. A decision
has been taken that no future share incentives will be made to the
senior management team reporting to the Avis Executive Board
(some 70 managers across the Group) but that they will participate
instead in an enhanced annual incentive plan.
Outstanding plans are as follows: Share Retention Plan (last award
December 2004), Performance Share Plan (last award April 2004),
Share Option Scheme (last award April 2004) and Equity Partnership
Plan (last award March 2002). A description of each of these plans
is set out below. The assessment of whether performance conditions
have been met is verified by the Remuneration Committee at the
time of vesting.
Given the increased volatility that arises when reporting earnings 
on the basis of International Financial Reporting Standards, 
where earnings per share is included as a measurement in the
performance conditions of a plan, it is the intention of the
management to continue in the short to medium-term to assess
performance for awards made to date on the basis of UK GAAP 
to ensure that performance is measured on a consistent basis.
Pursuant to the Company's rights issue in July 2005, the
Remuneration Committee approved adjustments to the existing
grants under the Company's existing share schemes, such that 
the number of shares subject to option increased by a multiplier 
of 1.193 and the exercise price was reduced by a multiplier of
0.8383. These adjustments ensured that the total price to exercise
an option remained unaltered.
Individual Directors' share incentive awards are set out on page 32.
The Remuneration Committee is introducing new executive
shareholding guidelines to require the executive Directors to 
build up their personal holdings of shares in the Company. 
This will further align their interests with those of shareholders. 
The guidelines will be 150% of salary for the Chief Executive and
100% of salary for other executive Directors. The Remuneration
Committee will require executives to retain 50% of any vested
shares (net of tax and exercise costs) arising from any share 
or option plan until the shareholding requirement is achieved. 
Share Retention Plan
On 21 December 2004, a Share Retention Plan was established 
as a one-off discretionary benefit for the purposes of retaining the
services of the Chief Executive. The Remuneration Committee
views the contribution of the Chief Executive to the development
and implementation of the Group's recovery strategy as essential
and therefore determined that it was appropriate to implement this
plan to facilitate his retention over the medium-term.
The principal terms of the Plan are as follows. The sole participant 
is the Chief Executive and the conditional award is in the form of 
a nil cost option to acquire ordinary shares in the Company. The
Plan was implemented in accordance with section 13.13A(b) of the
Listing Rules. In normal circumstances the option will vest in three
equal tranches at 1 January 2006, 1 January 2007 and 1 January
2008, provided that he is still employed by the Group and is not
subject to notice of termination of his employment (whether given 
or received) on these dates. There are no performance conditions
relating to this award. The option is exercisable within three months
of vesting (12 months in the case of death and one month in the case
of takeover). Benefits provided under the Plan are not pensionable. Avis Europe plc 27
Annual Report and Accounts 2005
The award will normally lapse on cessation of employment (save 
on death when the award will vest in full). If employment ceases 
by reason of injury or disability or for any other reason if the
Remuneration Committee so decides, the Remuneration Committee
has the discretion to decide whether or not the option will vest and,
if so, the extent to which it will vest. In the event of a takeover, 
the Remuneration Committee will decide the extent to which any
outstanding part of the award will vest. In the event of a corporate
reorganisation, the Remuneration Committee may decide that the
award continues over the shares of any new holding company.
If there is a de-merger or other corporate event, which in the opinion
of the Remuneration Committee will materially affect the share
price, then the Remuneration Committee may decide that the award
vests early. In the event of any increase or variation in the share
capital of the Company, the payment of a capital dividend or other
events similarly affecting the award the number of shares subject 
to the award may be adjusted. The Remuneration Committee may
alter the Plan at any time.
Performance Share Plan
The Performance Share Plan is a seven-year plan, designed to
encourage executive focus on longer-term performance and growth
in shareholder value. A combination of performance targets was
chosen for the measurement of the Company's performance being
total shareholder return (TSR) and earnings per share (EPS) in order
to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders.
Awards are determined by the Remuneration Committee and 
may not be greater than 100% of the qualifying participant's total
annual remuneration measured at the date of the award. No award
granted to date has exceeded one times annual salary. Awards 
vest over a period of seven years from the date of the award. If the
performance conditions are met at the third and fifth anniversary 
of the date of award, vesting accelerates to the extent of 25% of 
the award on each of these occasions. The extent to which an
award vests is determined by the Group's medium and long-term
performance measured in terms of TSR. TSR is measured against 
a broad comparator group from the Transport and Support Services
sectors, as Avis is a service company classified in the Transport
sector. In 2004, the comparator group was changed to reflect a
more comparable peer group taking into account the circumstances
of the Company. The revised comparator group includes a greater
focus on travel orientated and international companies.
For the awards to vest, TSR at the end of each performance period
must be at least at the median in relation to the comparator group
and there has to be a minimum real increase in EPS of 3% per
annum over the relevant period.
For awards made prior to 2004, if both these conditions are met
50% of the award may vest. For full vesting the EPS target must 
be met and the Group's TSR must be in the top quartile of the
comparator group over the seven-year period. TSR achievement
between the median and 75th percentile will result in vesting
between 50% and 100% of the award on a pro rata basis.
The comparator group for TSR for awards made prior to 2003
comprises the companies listed below:
Airtours plc, Arena Leisure plc, Arriva plc, Associated British Ports
Holdings plc, Eurotunnel plc/Eurotunnel SA, First Choice Holidays plc,
First Group plc, Go-Ahead Group plc, Lex Service plc, Minorplanet
Systems plc, Mitie Group plc, National Express Group plc, NFC plc,
Ocean Group plc, Powell Duffryn plc, Christian Salvesen plc,
Stagecoach Holdings plc, TBI plc, Thomson Travel Group plc,
Tibbett & Britten Group plc.
The comparator group for TSR for awards made in 2003 comprises
the companies listed below:
Arena Leisure plc, Arriva plc, Associated British Ports Holdings plc,
Eurotunnel plc/Eurotunnel SA, First Choice Holidays plc, First 
Group plc, Go-Ahead Group plc, RAC plc, Minorplanet Systems plc, 
Mitie Group plc, MyTravel Group plc, National Express Group plc,
Christian Salvesen plc, Stagecoach Holdings plc, TBI plc, Tibbett 
& Britten Group plc.
On change of control the Remuneration Committee will take into
account the performance conditions when determining the vesting
of awards.
The performance conditions for the award to the Chief Executive 
in April 2004 are different from the conditions previously applied 
to awards in the following respects:
  only 30% of the award will vest for median performance; and
  the comparator group comprises the following companies: 
Accor, Air France, Alpha Airports Group plc, BAA plc, British
Airways plc, Carnival plc, EasyJet plc, Eurotunnel plc, First Choice
Holidays plc, First Group plc, Hilton Group plc, Holidaybreak plc,
Intercontinental Hotels Group plc, Kuoni Reisen Holding AG,
Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc, NH
Hoteles SA, P&O Steam Navigation Company, Ryanair Holdings
plc, Sixt AG, TBI plc, TUI AG.
The other terms of the award are the same as for other awards
made under the Performance Share Plan.
No awards under this Plan were made in 2005.
Share option schemes
The Group operates Inland Revenue approved and unapproved
share option schemes which have an EPS based performance
condition. An EPS condition is considered appropriate, as it requires
improvement in the underlying financial performance before options
can be exercised. Employees may not normally exercise options
earlier than three years nor more than 10 years after the grant
(seven years for grants made before April 2000 for the unapproved
scheme). Options will lapse upon cessation of employment.
However, special conditions apply if employment ceases because
of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the
employing business or company is transferred outside the Group, 
or for any other reason at the discretion of the Board.
From 2004, the performance conditions were revised having regard
to the views and best interests of the Company's shareholders.
Options will be fully exercisable only if the real growth in EPS during
the three-year period 2004 to 2006 exceeds 10% per annum
compound. For 30% of the options to be exercisable there must  Remuneration Report continued
28 Avis Europe plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2005
be real minimum growth of 5% per annum compound. Vesting will
be on a straight-line basis for EPS growth between these targets.
There will be no opportunity to retest the performance condition 
if it is not met over the specified three-year performance period. 
On change of control, the Remuneration Committee will take into
account performance when determining the vesting of awards.
Options granted prior to 2004 become exercisable when real 
growth in EPS exceeds 3% per annum during any period of three
consecutive years following the date of grant.
The rules of the share option schemes limit the number of options
that can be granted over new issue shares in a rolling 10-year
period to 5% of issued share capital under discretionary share
schemes, and 10% of issued share capital under all share schemes.
The total number of share options granted at 31 December 2005 
is well within these dilution limits.
No options were granted under these schemes in 2005. Further
details of share option movements are set out in Note 31 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Directors' entitlements under these schemes are set out 
in table (c) on page 31.
Equity Partnership Plan
The Equity Partnership Plan was designed to encourage senior
management throughout the Group to retain a shareholding in 
the Company over a period of time. No awards have been made
under this Plan since 2002 and it is being discontinued.
The Plan has two components: the Partnership share award and 
the Loyalty share award.
Partnership share award
The Remuneration Committee could invite participants to invest part
of their annual bonus to acquire shares in the Company and in return
an award would be granted by the Company over additional shares
calculated as a proportion of the amount invested, provided that
participants remained employed for a specified period, retained the
shares they had acquired throughout the period and that there was
EPS increase in real terms of 3% per annum over the three-year
period commencing with the year in which the award was granted.
Loyalty share award
A one-off Loyalty share award was made in 2000 to over 80 senior
managers including the executive Directors, to encourage share
retention. The number of shares awarded was 25% of the shares
held under options granted at the flotation of the Company or
commencement of employment, if later. These awards vest in three
equal instalments on the sixth, seventh and eighth anniversary of
the date of the grant of the qualifying option, provided that the
participant has not disposed of more than one-third of the shares
under that option in respect of each of the three years following 
the third anniversary of grant of option.
If these conditions are met the Loyalty share award will only vest 
if the performance condition attached to the qualifying option has
been achieved, which is a minimum real increase in EPS of 3% per
annum during any period of three consecutive years following the
date of grant. During 2005, the third and final instalment of Loyalty
share awards relating to options granted in 1997 vested.
Avis Europe Employee Share Trust
The Avis Europe Employee Share Trust was established in March
2000 to facilitate provision of shares for the Company's share
incentive schemes. The Trust may hold up to 5% of the issued
share capital of the Company at any one time. During 2005, as a
result of the rights issue, 241,472 additional shares were acquired
by the Trust and the number of shares drawn down during the
period was 158,024, which related to the third release of Loyalty
share awards.
At 31 December 2005, the Trust held 664,049 shares, including
shares acquired under the rights issue. It is intended that the 
shares in the Trust will be used to satisfy conditional share awards
made under the Performance Share Plan, Share Retention Plan 
and Equity Partnership Plan as and when these awards vest. The
awards outstanding under each of these Plans at 31 December
2004 and 31 December 2005 are set out below and the number 
at 31 December 2005 includes the additional shares arising from 
the rights issue:
Conditional share Conditional share

Total 2,061,522 shares 2,129,625 shares
The Company periodically reviews the number of shares held by the
Employee Share Trust in light of the anticipated vesting dates and
performance conditions under the various plans. The Company also
regularly reviews its hedging policy but does not currently hedge
any of these awards against potential Social Security costs that may
be incurred across the Group as and when the awards vest.
Total shareholder return (TSR)
The graph below illustrates the performance of Avis Europe plc 
and a broad equity market index  over the past five years. As 
Avis Europe plc has been a constituent of the FTSE 350 index
throughout this five-year period, that index is considered the most
appropriate form of broad equity market index  against which the
Group's performance should be graphed. As required by legislation,
performance is measured by total shareholder return (share price
plus dividends paid).

Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors' fees are positioned to attract non-
executives with broad business and commercial experience and 
to be competitive in the marketplace. The Chairman's fee is
determined by the Remuneration Committee. The Chairman and 
the Chief Executive set the remuneration of non-executive Directors
based on periodic review of current survey data. Policy is to pay 
an annual fee with further payment for additional Committee
chairmanship responsibilities. Non-executive Directors do not
receive awards under the Company's share incentive schemes.
Engagement policy
Executive Directors
The Company's policy is to issue each executive Director with a
service contract which is subject to 12 months' notice on either side
and runs until terminated. The contract provides for salary to be
paid for any unexpired period of notice in the event of termination
by the Company. Any such payment would be discounted in line
with the mitigation obligations of the departing Director. There are
no special contractual payments associated with change of control.
All current executive Directors have service contracts in line with
policy as shown:
Date of service contract Notice period
Jean-Pierre Bizet* 25 May 2004 12 months
Lesley Colyer 18 April 2002 12 months
Murray Hennessy 17 May 2004 12 months
Simon Palethorpe 5 October 2004 12 months
Martyn Smith 11 September 2002 12 months
*Subject to the terms of the Relationship Agreement in respect of Directors
appointed by s.a. D'Ieteren n.v.
The Board believes that it can be of benefit to Avis if its executive
Directors serve as non-executive Directors of other companies, and,
subject to individual review, the general policy is that an executive
Director may hold one non-executive directorship with another
company and may retain the fees. Murray Hennessy holds a 
non-executive directorship and has waived his fee. Since June
2005, Martyn Smith has been a non-executive director with 
SMG plc for which he received  19,912. Simon Palethorpe holds 
a directorship with a government body for which his fees are up to 
a maximum of  10,000 per annum.
Non-executive Directors
The Company's policy is to engage non-executive Directors 
on renewable three-year terms but which can be terminated 
by either party at any time without penalty (subject to the terms 
of the Relationship Agreement in respect of Directors appointed 
by s.a. D'Ieteren n.v.) Non-executive Directors are required to 
offer themselves for election at the next Annual General Meeting
following their appointment and thereafter for re-election every three
years. They normally retire at the Annual General Meeting following
their 70th birthday.

2004, having served as a non-executive Director for the period 1 April 1999 
to 30 April 2002. Gilbert van Marcke de Lummen served as an executive
Director from 3 February 1997 to 30 April 2002.
 
Kevin Sheehan resigned from the Board on 11 April 2005.
All non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, have letters 
of appointment in accordance with policy.
Retirement benefits
The executive Directors are, like other employees, eligible for
membership of the Avis UK Pension Plan. This Plan is a defined
benefit Plan and comprises two sections: the non-contributory 
Final Salary section which was closed to new entrants from 
1 July 2003, and the contributory Retirement Capital section 
which is open to new members from the same date. Lesley Colyer
and Martyn Smith are members of the Final Salary section and, 
after at least 20 years' service, their retirement pension at normal
retirement date will be two-thirds of Final Pensionable Salary,
inclusive of any benefits retained in other pension schemes 
prior to joining Avis. Murray Hennessy and Simon Palethorpe 
are members of the Retirement Capital section, under which an
allocation of 25% of their pensionable salary is made to a notional
account. Each year the account balance is revalued by inflation 
up to 10%, although the Company may at its absolute discretion
and subject to actuarial advice apply a greater rate of revaluation. 
At retirement the balance in the account will be used to purchase 
an annuity. Pensionable salary for all executive Directors excludes
bonus payments, taxable benefits and cash allowances. For Murray
Hennessy, Simon Palethorpe and Martyn Smith pensionable salary
is restricted to the level of the Inland Revenue earnings cap and
they each receive a taxable cash allowance of 20% of base salary
above the earnings cap.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the impact of the
forthcoming Inland Revenue legislation relating to tax-favoured
retirement provision (pensions simplification ). The measures 
that the Company has taken are broadly cost neutral in order 
to avoid increasing the Company's pension liabilities as a 
result of this legislation. The Company is not responsible for
compensating individuals for changes in personal tax liabilities
arising from the legislation. Remuneration Report continued

3 M Hennessy and S Palethorpe are members of the Retirement Capital section of the Avis UK Pension Plan. This is a cash balance  arrangement to which 
the Directors and the Company contribute. Each year an amount equal to 25% of salary up to the Inland Revenue earnings cap is credited to a notional
account. At 1 April each year after the first year, the account balance is revalued by the rate of inflation over the preceding calendar year, subject to a
maximum of 10%. The Company may at its absolute discretion and subject to actuarial advice apply a greater rate of revaluation. At retirement the account
will have been built up from each year's annual credit plus the annual revaluation amount, and the balance in the account will be used to purchase an annuity
on behalf of the Director. In the year to 31 December 2005, the value of the Company's contributions for M Hennessy was  9,141 (2004:  6,433) and for 
S Palethorpe was  5,025 (2004:  333). Avis Europe plc 31

At 31 December 2005, 288 qualifying employees held options over 7,075,736 shares. This figure is inclusive of the additional shares arising
from the rights issue in July 2005 when the shares under option were increased by a multiplier of 1.193 and the option exercise price was
reduced by a multiplier of 0.8383. No options were granted in 2005. The market price of the Company's shares at 31 December 2005 was
70 pence. During the year, the market price ranged between 40.87 pence and 74.5 pence. As a result of the rights issue undertaken during
the year, and in line with normal market practice, share prices prior to the date the Company shares traded ex-rights (5 July 2005) have
been adjusted to reflect the bonus element of the rights issue. Remuneration Report continued
