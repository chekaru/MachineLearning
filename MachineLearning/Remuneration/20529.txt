Part 1 (Unaudited)
Remuneration Committee
Scope
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on
remuneration for executive Directors and senior management and for
determining specific remuneration packages for executive Directors and
members of the Avis Executive Board. The Committee is constituted under
terms of reference laid down by the Board. These terms are designed 
to enable the Company to comply with the requirements relating to
remuneration policy contained in the Combined Code.
The full terms of reference are set out on the Company's website:
www.avis-europe.com and are available upon request.
During 2007, the Remuneration Committee's activities included:
  setting remuneration for new appointments to the 
Avis Executive Board (AEB);
  adoption of a new LTIP and initial grant of awards under the plan; 
  review of Remuneration Committee effectiveness; and 
  approval of terms of appointment for the new Chief Executive and
departure terms for Murray Hennessy.
Membership 
The Remuneration Committee is comprised of non-executive Directors.
Members during the period 1 January 2007 to 27 February 2008 are 
listed below:
  Malcolm Miller (Chairman);
  Alun Cathcart (appointed 24 August 2007); 
  Les Cullen; 
  Roland D'Ieteren;
  Dr Axel von Ruedorffer; and
  Pierre Alain De Smedt (appointed 27 February 2008)
The Remuneration Committee is comprised of the Chairman of the Board
and five non-executive Directors. All the non-executive Directors on the
Committee are regarded as independent, with the exception of Roland
D'Ieteren, as explained on page 26 of the Corporate Governance report.
The Committee met 10 times during the year and each member's
attendance at these meetings is shown in the Corporate Governance report
on page 26.
Advisers
During the period under review the Chief Executive and the Group HR and
Corporate Affairs Director attended meetings by invitation and provided
advice to the Committee to help it make informed decisions on matters
relating to Directors' performance and remuneration. No Director was
present when his or her own remuneration was being discussed. External
advice was received from Kepler Associates (executive remuneration) and
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer (share scheme rules). All advisers were
appointed by the Company. Other than described above, no additional
services were provided by the external advisers during the year.
Remuneration policy
Introduction
The Group's policy relating to the remuneration and benefits of executive and
non-executive Directors is reviewed periodically. The executive remuneration
policy for 2008 is designed to secure the skills and experience the Group
needs to meet its objectives and satisfy shareholder expectations. In general,
in determining its policy, the Remuneration Committee takes account of
market practice, the Group's position relative to other companies and the pay
and employment conditions of other Group employees.
In late 2005 the Remuneration Committee carried out a full review of
executive remuneration designed to align rewards with delivery of the
Group's recovery plan. As a result of this review, salaries were frozen for
three years while incentive opportunities were increased. In line with the
commitment made to shareholders, there will be no increases to executive
Director salaries during 2008 for the final year of this three-year period.
Directors and members of the AEB have an annual incentive opportunity of
up to 100% of salary and will receive a further grant under the Long Term
Incentive Plan introduced in 2007 and described below.
Summary of executive Directors' potential direct remuneration
The Remuneration Committee believes that shareholder interests are 
best served by remuneration packages that have a large component of
performance related pay. For 2008 the relationship between fixed and
variable remuneration for achievement of maximum performance is:
Chief Executive 29% fixed, 71% variable; other executive Directors 33%
fixed, 67% variable. Remuneration Report continued
32 Avis Europe plc Annual Report 2007
The potential direct remuneration of executive Directors is illustrated below.
The annual bonus is valued on a full payout basis and the benefit of the
long-term incentives are calculated using the face value of the shares at the
date of grant.
Salary
The policy on base salary up to and including 2005 was to benchmark 
using general market external surveys against the median of similar sized
companies relevant to the appropriate marketplace. In considering whether
to make any increase to base salaries, the Remuneration Committee takes
into account the performance of individual executives and the general
increases for employees across the Group.
From 2006 to 2009 executive and senior management salaries are frozen.
It is anticipated that from 2009 onwards base salaries will then be below the
market median, with short and long-term incentives providing competitive
total remuneration aligned to delivery of results.
Annual incentive bonus 
Annual incentive bonus plans for executive Directors and key senior
management are based on achievement of targets approved by the
Remuneration Committee and related directly to the annual profit plan
approved by the Board. Targets and performance measures are quantitative
and there is a financial threshold below which no bonus payment is made.
In 2007 and 2008 the annual bonus opportunity is up to 100% of salary,
with 50% of salary payable for on-target performance. In 2008, 80% of the
bonus is based on stretching financial targets and 20% on achievement of
quantitative functional objectives.
The base salary, bonus payments and value of benefits in kind for each
Director are set out in the Directors' emoluments table on page 35. Bonus
payments, benefits in kind and cash allowances do not form part of
pensionable earnings for Directors.
Share incentive policy 
The Remuneration Committee introduced a new long-term incentive plan
during 2007 that is aligned with the Group's medium term plan and
shareholders' interests.
Shareholding guidelines were implemented in 2005 that require the
executive Directors to build up their personal holdings of shares in the
Company. The guidelines are 150% of salary for the Chief Executive and
100% of salary for other executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee
requires executives to retain 50% of any vested shares (net of tax and
exercise costs) arising from any share or option plan until the shareholding
requirement is achieved.
Outstanding share plans 
Outstanding share plans are as follows: Long Term Incentive Plan (last award
2007); 2006 Deferred Bonus Share Plan (last award 2007); Performance
Share Plan (last award April 2004) and Share Option Schemes (last award
April 2004). A description of each of these plans is set out below. The
assessment of whether performance conditions have been met is verified by
the Remuneration Committee at the time of vesting.
Individual Directors' share incentive awards are set out on pages 36 to 38.
Long Term Incentive Plan 
In 2007 the Remuneration Committee introduced a long-term incentive plan.
It is intended that there will be annual grants of awards under this Plan
which will vest three years after grant, providing certain performance
conditions are met. These conditional awards take the form of nil cost
options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company.
The performance conditions required for vesting purposes are based 50% on
the Company's three-year growth in earnings per share (EPS) and 50% on
return on capital employed (ROCE), based on the Group's results under the
International Financial Reporting Standards.
The initial performance targets for awards granted under the Plan are set 
out below:
EPS tranche of Award
Percentage growth in EPS Percentage of award that vests
Less than RPI + 20% per annum None
RPI + 20% per annum 20%
RPI + 40% per annum 100%
Between 20% and 40% per annum Straight-line basis between 
above RPI 20% and 100%
ROCE tranche of Award
Percentage ROCE achieved Percentage of award that vests
Less than 10% None
10% 20%
12.5% 100%
Between 10% and 12.5% Straight-line basis between
20% and 100%
If one or both of the performance targets are not met at the end of 
the performance period, 50% or 100% (as appropriate) of the award will
lapse immediately.
EPS will be calculated on an underlying basis ie excluding exceptional items,
certain re-measurement items and economic hedge items. However, the
Remuneration Committee has discretion to adjust for exceptional items 
it deems to be within management control, if appropriate, to ensure the
outcome is fair to both shareholders and executives. ROCE will be calculated
on a three-point annual average, to reflect the seasonality of the business,
based upon the return for the particular year divided by the average capital
employed of the previous closing, interim and prevailing closing positions. The
return (operating profit) will be adjusted on the same underlying basis as EPS.
ROCE and EPS are considered by the Remuneration Committee to be the
most relevant all-encompassing long-term performance measures for Avis
Europe. The business of the Group is fundamentally about achieving a good
economic return on renting its fleet of vehicles. The fleet represents the
substantial majority of capital employed, and the Remuneration Committee
wishes management to be focussed on improving the return the Company
achieves on this capital. Management will focus on the key drivers of ROCE -
asset turn and operating margin. EPS in turn represents a complete measure
of bottom-line performance, capturing both interest and tax, and is closely
tracked by many of the Company's investors. The calculation of EPS and

ROCE performance is taken from the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Participation is at the Remuneration Committee's discretion. In 2007 awards
were made to all members of the AEB, which included four of the executive
Directors. Maximum awards are capped at 100% of salary (150% for the
Chief Executive) (see page 36). Dividends, as and when reinstated, will 
not accrue on these awards, but it is anticipated that for awards granted 
in future, dividends would accrue and be paid only on shares that vest.
Outstanding awards will vest and become exerciseable on a change of
control subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time.
2006 Deferred Bonus Share Plan 
During 2006, the Avis Europe plc Deferred Bonus Share Plan was
established as part of the Remuneration Committee's decision to enhance
bonus opportunities for 2006 in order to maintain momentum on delivering
short-term targets and make no long-term awards during that year. 50% 
of the bonus earned in respect of the year to 31 December 2006 was paid 
in cash after publication of the 2006 results and 50% was deferred into 
an award over Avis Europe shares to be released, subject to continued
employment, in March 2008. The share award is in the form of a nil cost
option to acquire ordinary shares in the Company, which were purchased 
on the market and are held in the Avis Europe Employee Share Trust.
The participants are key senior managers, including four of the executive
Directors. Outstanding share awards will vest and become exerciseable 
in full on a change of control.
Share Retention Plan 
No awards under this Plan have been made since December 2004. The Share
Retention Plan was established as a one off discretionary benefit to retain 
the services of Murray Hennessy (former Chief Executive) to January 2008.
Therefore there were no performance conditions other than continued service
to 1 January 2008. The award was in the form of a nil cost option to acquire
ordinary shares in the Company that vested in three equal tranches on 
1 January 2006, 1 January 2007 and 1 January 2008. In respect of the 
third tranche that would have vested on 1 January 2008, the Remuneration
Committee exercised its discretion under the rules of the Plan to permit this
award to vest on the date of Murray Hennessy's termination of employment 
on 31 December 2007.
Performance Share Plan 
No awards under this Plan have been made since April 2004 and it is 
not anticipated that awards will be made in the future. The Performance
Share Plan is a seven-year plan, and was designed to encourage executives
to focus on longer-term performance and growth in shareholder value.
A combination of performance targets was chosen for the measurement 
of the Company's performance, being total shareholder return (TSR) and
earnings per share (EPS) in order to align the interests of executives with
those of shareholders. EPS performance is calculated from the audited
accounts and TSR is calculated by external remuneration consultants.
Awards were determined by the Remuneration Committee and could not be
greater than 100% of the qualifying participant's total annual remuneration
measured at the date of the award. No award granted to date has exceeded
one times annual salary. Awards vest over a period of seven years from the
date of the award. If the performance conditions are met at the third and fifth
anniversary of the date of award, vesting accelerates to the extent of 25% of
the award on each of these occasions. The extent to which an award vests is
determined by the Group's medium and long-term performance measured in
terms of TSR. TSR was measured against a broad comparator group from
the Transport and Support Services sectors.
On a change of control the Remuneration Committee would take into account
the performance conditions when determining the vesting of awards.
Share option schemes 
No options have been granted under these schemes since April 2004 and it is
not anticipated that awards will be made in the future. Further details of share
options are set out in Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Group operates Inland Revenue approved and unapproved share option
schemes which have an EPS based performance condition. An EPS condition
is considered appropriate, as it requires improvement in the underlying
financial performance before options can be exercised. Employees may not
normally exercise options earlier than three years nor more than 10 years
after the grant (seven years for grants made before April 2000 for the
unapproved scheme). Options lapse upon cessation of employment. However,
special conditions apply if employment ceases because of death, injury,
disability, redundancy, retirement or because the employing business or
company is transferred outside the Group, or for any other reason at the
discretion of the Board. Outstanding options will vest and become
exerciseable on a change of control and with the exception of the UK
Approved Share Option Scheme, any options vesting will, at the discretion 
of the Remuneration Committee, be subject to the satisfaction of any
performance conditions at that time.
Options (all of which were granted prior to 2004) become exerciseable when
real growth in EPS exceeds 3% per annum during any period of three
consecutive years following the date of grant. The rules of the share option
schemes limit the number of options that can be granted over new issue
shares in a rolling 10-year period to 5% of issued share capital under
discretionary share schemes, and 10% of issued share capital under 
all share schemes. The total number of share options outstanding at 
31 December 2007 is well within these dilution limits (see page 38).
Avis Europe Employee Share Trust 
The Avis Europe Employee Share Trust was established in March 2000 
to facilitate provision of shares for the Company's share incentive schemes.
The Trust may hold up to 5% of the issued share capital of the Company 
at any one time.
At 31 December 2007, the Trust held 3,811,301 shares. It is intended that
the shares in the Trust will be used to satisfy conditional share awards made
under the Company's various share incentive schemes as and when these
awards vest. The awards outstanding under each of the relevant Plans at 
31 December 2006 and 31 December 2007 are set out below.
Conditional share Conditional share

The Company periodically reviews the number of shares held by the Trust in
light of the anticipated vesting dates and performance conditions under the
various plans. The Company also regularly reviews its hedging policy but
does not currently hedge any of these awards against potential Social  Remuneration Report continued

Total shareholder return (TSR) 
The graph below illustrates the performance of Avis Europe plc and a broad
equity market index  over the past five years. As Avis Europe plc has been a
constituent of the FTSE 350 Index throughout this five-year period, that index
is considered the most appropriate form of broad equity market index 
against which the Group's performance should be graphed. As required by
legislation, performance is measured by total shareholder return (share price
plus dividends paid).
All dates at 31 December.
This graph shows the value, by the end of 2007, of  100 invested in Avis Europe on 31 December
2002 compared with the value of  100 invested in the FTSE 350 Index. The other points plotted
are the values at intervening financial year ends.
Non-executive Directors 
Non-executive Directors' fees are positioned to attract non-executives with
broad business and commercial experience and to be competitive in the
marketplace. The Chairman's fee is determined by the Remuneration
Committee. The Chairman and the Chief Executive set the remuneration 
of non-executive Directors based on periodic review of current survey data.
Policy is to pay an annual fee of  32,500 with an additional fee for
chairmanship of a Committee. Non-executive Directors do not receive 
awards under the Company's share incentive schemes.
Service Contracts
Executive Directors
The Company's policy is to employ each executive Director under a service
contract which is subject to 12 months' notice on either side and runs until
terminated. The contract provides for salary to be paid for any unexpired
period of notice in the event of termination by the Company. Compensation
for contractual benefits and bonus for the unexpired period of notice is at the
discretion of the Remuneration Committee. There is no compensation for loss
of rights under the share and pension schemes. All contracts contain
mitigation provisions. There are no special contractual payments associated
with change of control.
All executive Directors have service contracts in line with policy as shown.
Date of service contract Notice period
Pascal Bazin 1 January 2008 12 months
Jean-Pierre Bizet* 25 May 2004 12 months
Lesley Colyer 18 April 2002 12 months
Simon Palethorpe 5 October 2004 12 months
Martyn Smith 11 September 2002 12 months
* The Deputy Chairman, who is also an executive Director, has a service contract with an annual fee
only and his appointment is subject to the terms of the Relationship Agreement (see page 25).
The Board believes that it can be of benefit to Avis Europe if its executive
Directors serve as non-executive Directors of other companies, and, subject
to individual review, the general policy is that an executive Director may hold
one non-executive directorship with another company and may retain the
fees. Martyn Smith was a non-executive Director of SMG plc until 
28 February 2007. For the period 1 January 2007 to 28 February 2007 
he received a fee of  7,550 plus a share purchase of  2,042.
Non-executive Directors
The Company's policy is to engage non-executive Directors on renewable
three-year terms, which can be terminated by either party at any time
without penalty (subject to the terms of the Relationship Agreement in
respect of Directors appointed by s.a. D'Ieteren n.v.). Non-executive Directors
are required to offer themselves for election at the next Annual General
Meeting following their appointment and thereafter for re-election every 
three years.

Directors. Alun Cathcart served as an executive Director for the periods 3 February 1997 to
31 March 1999 and 1 May 2002 to 24 May 2004, having served as a non-executive Director for
the period 1 April 1999 to 30 April 2002. Gilbert van Marcke de Lummen served as an executive
Director from 3 February 1997 to 30 April 2002.
All non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, have letters of
appointment in accordance with policy.
Retirement benefits
Executive Directors based in the UK can participate in the Avis UK 
Pension Plan. The Plan comprises two sections: the Final Salary section
(defined benefit) and the Retirement Capital Plan section (cash balance).
The non-contributory Final Salary section was closed to new entrants from 
1 July 2003, and closed to future service accruals for active members 
from 1 April 2007. New members to the Plan since 1 July 2003 have joined
the contributory Retirement Capital Plan section and, from 1 April 2007,
active members of the Final Salary section accrue their future service
benefits under the Retirement Capital Plan section.

Under the Retirement Capital Plan section, for those executive Directors who
are members of the Plan, an allocation of 25% of their pensionable salary is
made to a notional account. Each year the account balance is revalued by
inflation up to 10%, although the Company may at its absolute discretion and
subject to actuarial advice apply a greater rate of revaluation. At retirement
the balance in the account will be used to purchase an annuity. Pensionable
salary for executive Directors excludes bonus payments, taxable benefits and
cash allowances.
From 6 April 2006, the HM Revenue & Customs legislation relating to tax-
favoured retirement provisions took effect. From that date Avis introduced 
a scheme specific earnings cap for all members who joined the Plan on or
after 1 June 1989. For the 2007-08 tax year, the cap is  112,800. Those
executive Directors whose pensionable salary is subject to the cap receive 
a taxable cash allowance of 20% of base salary above the cap.
Four executive Directors accrue benefits under the Avis UK Pension Plan and
as at 31 December 2007, the retirement benefits are as follows.
Lesley Colyer accrued benefits under the Final Salary section for pensionable
service until 1 April 2007, and her pensionable service to that date will
continue to be linked to her pensionable salary in the future in accordance
with the rules of the Plan. From 1 April 2007 she accrues future service
benefits in the Retirement Capital section. Her pensionable salary is not
subject to the scheme specific earnings cap.
Simon Palethorpe is a member of the Retirement Capital section in respect
of all his pensionable service. His pensionable salary is subject to the
scheme specific earnings cap and he receives a taxable cash allowance 
as described above.
Martyn Smith withdrew from the Plan effective 5 April 2006 and has
a preserved pension entitlement under the Final Salary section. From that 
date he receives a taxable cash allowance of 20% of base salary in lieu 
of Pension Plan membership.
Murray Hennessy left the Plan effective 31 December 2007 and has
a preserved benefit entitlement under the Retirement Capital section.

Performance conditions
The performance conditions required for vesting purposes are based 50% on the Company's three-year growth in earnings per share (EPS) and 50% on return
on capital employed (ROCE), based on the Group's results under the International Financial Reporting Standards. These targets are set such that shares will
vest only if performance is between a minimum threshold level, where 20% of an award will vest, and the maximum level, where 100% of an award will vest.
2006 Deferred Bonus Share Plan
The following awards were made under this Plan on 5 June 2007. The market price of the Company's shares at that date was 60.25 pence. As at 31
December 2007, Murray Hennessy's award had vested. The Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion to allow his award to vest at that date in
recognition of the fact that he had remained in service throughout the financial year to which the award related.

Performance conditions 
The performance conditions applying to the Performance Share Plan have been based on the performance of the Company in relation to the total shareholder
return (TSR) of a peer group, together with an earnings per share (EPS) underpin.
For the awards to vest, TSR at the end of each performance period must be at least at the median in relation to the comparator group and there has to be
a minimum real increase in EPS of 3% per annum over the relevant period.
For awards made prior to 2004, if both these conditions are met, 50% of the award may vest. For full vesting, the EPS target must be met and the Group's
TSR must be in the top quartile of the comparator group over the seven-year period. TSR achievement between the median and 75th percentile results in
vesting between 50% and 100% of the award on a pro rata basis. Remuneration Report continued

1 Alun Cathcart's and Gilbert van Marcke de Lummen's share options were granted when they were executive Directors of the Company.
Performance conditions
The performance conditions applying to the share option schemes have been based on real growth in earnings per share (EPS).
Options granted before 2004 become exerciseable when real growth in EPS exceeds 3% per annum during any period of three consecutive years following the
date of grant. Only options shown as having an exerciseable date of March 2000 have satisfied this performance condition.
Options granted in 2004 become exerciseable when real growth in EPS during the three-year period 2004 to 2006 exceeds 10% per annum compound. For 30%
of the options to be exerciseable there must be real minimum growth of 5% per annum compound. Vesting is on a straight-line basis for EPS growth between
these targets. There is no re-testing and as the performance conditions relating to options granted in 2004 have not been met, these options have lapsed.
At 31 December 2007, 211 qualifying employees held options over 3,530,733 shares. No options were granted in 2007. The market price of the Company's
shares at 31 December 2007 was 40.5 pence. During the year, the market price ranged between 27.25 pence and 90.25 pence.
