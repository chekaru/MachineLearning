 4 	 avis-europe.com	 Annual Report 2008
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Remuneration Report and the Parent Company Financial Statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the Consolidated 
Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and the Parent 
Company Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice). The Consolidated and Parent Company Financial 
Statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group 
for that year. 
In preparing those Financial Statements, the Directors are required to: 
   select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; new 
accounting standards adopted in the year are set out in the Significant 
Accounting policies section of the Consolidated Financial Statements on 
pages 49 to 55; 
   make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
   state that the Consolidated Financial Statements comply with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union, and with regard to the Parent Company 
Financial Statements that applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
Financial Statements; and 
   prepare the Consolidated and Parent Company Financial Statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Group will continue in business, in which case there should be supporting 
assumptions or qualifications as necessary. 
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in 
preparing the Financial Statements. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the Consolidated 
Financial Statements and Remuneration Report comply with the Companies 
Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and the Parent Company 
Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' 
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and the relevant requirements 
of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority. The Board has given full 
consideration to the best practice provisions on Directors' remuneration as 
set out in the Combined Code. As required by the Directors' Remuneration 
Report Regulations, a resolution to approve the Remuneration Report will 
be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company at 
which the Financial Statements will be approved. 
Part 1 of this report sets out the Group's policy on executive remuneration 
and explains the various elements of the Directors' remuneration packages. 
Part 2 of this report, which contains the information on which auditors 
are required to report to the Company's shareholders, sets out details of 
Directors' earnings and pension entitlements and fees paid to non-executive 
Directors in 2008. Directors' interests in shares, share incentive awards and 
share options, all of which are beneficial except as noted, are set out on 
pages 40 to 42.

Membership 
The Remuneration Committee is comprised of non-executive Directors. 
Members during the period 1 January 2008 to 3 March 2009 are  
listed below: 
   Pierre Alain De Smedt (Chairman from 29 May 2008; appointed to the 
Committee 27 February 2008)

  Dr Axel von Ruedorffer
The Remuneration Committee is comprised of the Chairman of the Board 
and four non-executive Directors. All the non-executive Directors on the 
Committee are regarded as independent, with the exception of Roland 
D'Ieteren, as explained on page 30 of the Corporate Governance report. The 
Committee met six times during the year and each member's attendance at 
these meetings is shown in the Corporate Governance report on page 30. 
Advisers 
During the period under review the Chief Executive, the Group HR and 
Corporate Affairs Director (until her retirement on 4 July 2008) and thereafter 
the Group HR Director attended meetings by invitation and provided advice 
to the Committee to help it make informed decisions on matters relating to 
Directors' performance and remuneration. No Director was present when his 
or her own remuneration was being discussed. External advice was received 
from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer (share scheme rules) and Kepler 
Associates (executive remuneration). All advisers were appointed by the 
Company. Other than described above, no additional services were provided 
by the external advisers during the year. 
Remuneration	 policy
Introduction 
The Group's policy relating to the remuneration and benefits of executive and 
non-executive Directors is reviewed periodically. The executive remuneration 
policy for 2009 is designed to attract, retain and motivate to ensure that the 
Company secures the appropriate competencies and experience the Group 
needs to meet its objectives and satisfy shareholder expectations. In general, 
in determining its policy, the Remuneration Committee takes account of 
market practice, the Group's position relative to other companies and the pay 
and employment conditions of other Group employees. 
In 2008 executive salaries were frozen as part of a three-year programme 
implemented for 2006 - 2008 inclusive. Directors and members of the 
AEB received an annual incentive opportunity of up to 100% of salary and 
received a further grant under the Long Term Incentive Plan introduced in 
2007 and described below.
For 2009 executive salaries were again frozen and the AEB was given an 
annual incentive opportunity of up to 100% of salary linked to targets which 
will reflect the key challenges of the business.
Summary of executive Directors' potential direct remuneration 
The Remuneration Committee believes that shareholder interests are 
best served by remuneration packages that have a large component of 
performance related pay. For 2009 the relationship between fixed and 
variable remuneration for achievement of maximum performance for the 
Chief Executive is 35% fixed, 65% variable, and for the Group Finance 
Director is 40% fixed and 60% variable. The variable element comprises 
the annual incentive scheme and an award under the Long Term Incentive 
Plan. The Deputy Chairman, who is also an executive Director, has a service 
contract with an annual fee only.
Salary 
The general policy on base salary is to benchmark using general market 
external surveys against the median of similar sized companies relevant to the 
appropriate marketplace. In considering whether to make any increase to base 
salaries, the Remuneration Committee takes into account the performance  
of individual executives and the general increases for employees across  
the Group. The next benchmarking exercise will be undertaken in 2009. 
Annual incentive bonus 
Annual incentive bonus plans for executive Directors and key senior 
management are based on achievement of targets approved by the 
Remuneration Committee and related directly to the annual profit plan 
approved by the Board. Targets and performance measures are quantitative 
and there is a financial threshold below which no bonus payment is made. 
In 2009, 90% of the bonus is based on stretching financial targets and 10% 
on achievement of quantitative individual objectives.
The base salary, bonus payments and value of benefits in kind for each 
Director are set out in the Directors' emoluments table on page 39. Bonus 
payments, benefits in kind and cash allowances do not form part of 
pensionable earnings for Directors. 
Share	 incentive	 policy	 The Remuneration Committee sets policy with regard to share incentives with 
the objective of aligning incentive plans with the Group's medium-term plan 
and shareholders' interests.
Shareholding guidelines implemented in 2005 require executive Directors to 
build up their personal holdings of shares in the Company. The guidelines 
are 150% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of salary for other 
executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee requires executives to 
retain 50% of any vested shares (net of tax and exercise costs) arising from 
any share or option plan until the shareholding requirement is achieved. 
Outstanding share plans 
Outstanding share plans are as follows: Long Term Incentive Plan (last award 
2008); Performance Share Plan (last award April 2004) and Share Option 
Schemes (last award April 2004). A description of each of these plans is set 
out below. The assessment of whether performance conditions have been 
met is verified by the Remuneration Committee at the time of vesting. 
Individual Directors' share incentive awards are set out on pages 41 and 42. 
Long Term Incentive Plan 
The Long Term Incentive Plan comprises conditional awards which take the 
form of nil cost options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company, and was 
Corporate	 governance 6 	 avis-europe.com	 Annual Report 2008
introduced by the Remuneration Committee in 2007. Awards vest three years 
after grant, providing certain performance conditions are met. It is intended 
that there will be annual grants of awards under this Plan.
The performance conditions required for vesting purposes are based 50% 
on the Group's three-year growth in earnings per share (EPS) and 50% 
on return on capital employed (ROCE). If one or both of the performance 
targets are not met at the end of the performance period, 50% or 100% (as 
appropriate) of the award will lapse immediately. 
 
The performance targets for awards granted under the Plan in 2007 are set 
out below: 
EPS tranche of Award  
Percentage growth in EPS Percentage of award that vests
Less than RPI + 20% per annum None
RPI + 20% per annum 20%
RPI + 40% per annum 100%
Between 20% and 40% Straight-line basis between 
per annum above RPI 20% and 100%
ROCE tranche of Award  
Percentage ROCE achieved Percentage of award that vests
Less than 10% None
10% 20%
12.5% 100%
Between 10% and 12.5% Straight-line basis between 
 20% and 100%
The performance targets for awards granted under the Plan in 2008 are set 
out below:
EPS tranche of Award  
Percentage growth in EPS Percentage of award that vests
Less than 14.9% per annum None
14.9% per annum 20%
23.0% per annum 100%
Between 14.9% and 23.0%  Straight-line basis between
per annum  20% and 100%
ROCE tranche of Award  
Percentage ROCE achieved Percentage of award that vests
Less than 9.2% None
9.2% 20%
9.6% 100%
Between 9.2% and 9.6% Straight-line basis between 
 20% and 100%
EPS is calculated on an underlying basis i.e. excluding exceptional items, 
certain re-measurement items and economic hedge items. However, the 
Remuneration Committee has discretion to adjust for exceptional items 
it deems to be within management control, if appropriate, to ensure the 
outcome is fair to both shareholders and executives. The basis of the ROCE 
calculation is included in Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The two measures of EPS and ROCE are considered by the Remuneration 
Committee to be the most relevant all-encompassing long-term performance 
measures for Avis Europe in that the ultimate aim of the business of the 
Group is to achieve a good economic return on renting its fleet of vehicles. 
The fleet represents the substantial majority of capital employed, and the 
Remuneration Committee wishes management to be focussed on improving 
the return the Company achieves on this capital. Management will focus 
on the key drivers of ROCE - asset turn and operating margin. EPS in turn 
represents a complete measure of bottom-line performance, capturing both 
interest and tax, and is closely tracked by many of the Company's investors. 
Participation is at the Remuneration Committee's discretion. In 2008 awards 
were made to all members of the AEB, which included three of the executive 
Directors, and to 20 senior managers. Maximum awards are capped at 
100% of salary (150% for the Chief Executive) (see page 41). In 2008 
awards at this maximum level were granted to new members of the AEB; 
the executive Directors and other AEB members received awards over one 
half the maximum level, and the senior managers received awards over one 
quarter of the maximum level. Dividends, as and when reinstated, will not 
accrue on the awards made to date, but it is anticipated that for awards 
granted in future, dividends would accrue and be paid only on shares that 
vest. Outstanding awards will vest and become exercisable on a change of 
control subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time. 
Performance Share Plan 
No awards under this Plan have been made since April 2004 and it is not 
anticipated that awards will be made in the future. The Performance Share 
Plan is a seven-year plan, and was designed to encourage executives to 
focus on longer-term performance and growth in shareholder value. A 
combination of performance targets was chosen for the measurement of 
the Company's performance, being total shareholder return (TSR) and EPS 
in order to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders. EPS 
performance is calculated from the audited accounts and TSR is calculated 
by external remuneration consultants. 
Awards were determined by the Remuneration Committee and could not be 
greater than 100% of the qualifying participant's total annual remuneration 
measured at the date of the award. No award granted to date has exceeded 
one times annual salary. Awards vest over a period of seven years from the 
date of the award. If the performance conditions are met at the third and fifth 
anniversary of the date of award, vesting accelerates to the extent of 25% of 
the award on each of these occasions. The extent to which an award vests 
is determined by the Group's medium and long-term performance measured 
in terms of TSR. TSR was measured against a broad comparator group from 
the Transport and Support Services sectors. 
On a change of control the Remuneration Committee would take into account 
the performance conditions when determining the vesting of awards. 
Share option schemes 
No options have been granted under these schemes since April 2004,  
and it is not anticipated that awards will be made in the future.  
Further details of share options are set out in Note 32 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
The Group operates Inland Revenue approved and unapproved share option 
schemes which have an EPS based performance condition. An EPS condition 
is considered appropriate, as it requires improvement in the underlying 
Remuneration	report	 continued 	 avis-europe.com 	 Annual Report 2008 7
financial performance before options can be exercised. Employees may not 
normally exercise options earlier than three years, nor more than 10 years 
after the grant (seven years for grants made before April 2000 for the 
unapproved scheme). Options lapse upon cessation of employment. However, 
special conditions apply if employment ceases because of death, injury, 
disability, redundancy, retirement or because the employing business or 
company is transferred outside the Group, or for any other reason at the 
discretion of the Board. Outstanding options will vest and become exercisable 
on a change of control and with the exception of the UK Approved Share 
Option Scheme, any options vesting will, at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee, be subject to the satisfaction of any performance 
conditions at that time. 
Options (all of which were granted prior to 2004) become exercisable 
when real growth in EPS exceeds 3% per annum during any period of 
three consecutive years following the date of grant. The rules of the share 
option schemes limit the number of options that can be granted over new 
issue shares in a rolling 10-year period to 5% of issued share capital 
under discretionary share schemes, and 10% of issued share capital under 
all share schemes. The total number of share options outstanding at 31 
December 2008 is well within these dilution limits (see page 42). 
During 2008 all outstanding awards under the Deferred Bonus Share Plan 
and the Share Retention Plan were released. No awards remain outstanding 
under these schemes as at 31 December 2008. 
2006 Deferred Bonus Share Plan 
During 2006, the Avis Europe plc Deferred Bonus Share Plan was 
established as part of the Remuneration Committee's decision to enhance 
bonus opportunities for 2006. There are no outstanding awards under  
this plan.
Share Retention Plan
This Plan was established as a one-off discretionary benefit to retain the 
services of Murray Hennessy (former Chief Executive) to January 2008 
and there were no performance conditions other than continued service to 
1 January 2008. The award vested in three equal tranches on 1 January 
2006, 1 January 2007 and 1 January 2008. In respect of the third tranche, 
the Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion under the rules of 
the Plan to permit this award to vest on the date of Murray Hennessy's 
termination of employment on 31 December 2007, and was exercised in 
March 2008. 
Avis Europe Employee Share Trust 
The Avis Europe Employee Share Trust was established in March 2000 to 
facilitate provision of shares for the Company's share incentive schemes.  
The Trust may hold up to 5% of the issued share capital of the Company at 
any one time. 
At 31 December 2008, the Trust held 637,735 shares. It is intended that 
the shares in the Trust will be used to satisfy conditional share awards made 
under the Company's various share incentive schemes as and when these 
awards vest. The awards outstanding under each of the relevant Plans at  
31 December 2007 and 31 December 2008 are set out below: 
 
  Conditional share awards  Conditional share awards  
 outstanding at   outstanding at
Share Incentive Scheme  31 December 2008 31 December 2007
Performance Share Plan  514,875 shares 702,727 shares
Long Term Incentive Plan  31,274,278 shares 4,908,092 shares
Share Retention Plan  - 238,600 shares
Deferred Bonus Share Plan  - 3,124,452 shares
Total  31,789,153 shares 8,973,871 shares
The Company periodically reviews the number of shares held by the Trust 
in light of the anticipated vesting dates and performance conditions under 
the various plans. The Company also regularly reviews its hedging policy 
but does not currently hedge any of these awards against potential Social 
Security costs that may be incurred across the Group as and when the 
awards vest. 
Total	 shareholder	 return	 (TSR)
The graph below illustrates the performance of Avis Europe plc and a broad 
equity market index  over the past five years. As Avis Europe plc has been a 
constituent of the FTSE All Share Index throughout this five-year period, that 
index is considered the most appropriate form of broad equity market index  
against which the Group's performance should be graphed. As required by 
legislation, performance is measured by total shareholder return (share price 
plus dividends paid). 
 
All dates at 31 December.
This graph shows the value, by the end of 2008, of  100 invested in Avis Europe plc on 31 
December 2003 compared with the value of  100 invested in the FTSE All Share Index. The other 
points plotted are the values at intervening financial year ends. 
Non-executive	 Directors	 Non-executive Directors' fees are positioned to attract non-executives 
with broad business and commercial experience and to be competitive in 
the marketplace. The Chairman's fee is determined by the Remuneration 
Committee. The Chairman and the Chief Executive set the remuneration 
of non-executive Directors based on periodic review of current survey 
data. Policy is to pay an annual fee of  32,500 with an additional fee for 
chairmanship of a committee. Non-executive Directors do not receive awards 
under the Company's share incentive schemes.

Service	 contracts
Executive Directors 
The Company's policy is to employ each executive Director under a service 
contract which is subject to 12 months' notice on either side and runs until 
terminated. The contract provides for salary to be paid for any unexpired 
period of notice in the event of termination by the Company. Compensation 
for contractual benefits and bonus for the unexpired period of notice is at 
the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. There is no compensation for 
loss of rights under the share and pension schemes. All contracts contain 
mitigation provisions. There are no special contractual payments associated 
with change of control. 
All executive Directors have service contracts in line with policy as shown.

2 Lesley Colyer retired as a Director on 4 July 2008.
3 Simon Palethorpe resigned as a Director on 21 November 2008.
The Board believes that it can be of benefit to Avis Europe plc if its executive 
Directors serve as non-executive Directors of other companies, and, subject 
to individual review, the general policy is that an executive Director may hold 
one non-executive directorship with another company and may retain the 
fees. During the year ended 31 December 2008, no executive Director held 
any external directorships. 
Non-executive Directors 
The Company's policy is to engage non-executive Directors on renewable 
three-year terms, which can be terminated by either party at any time without 
penalty (subject to the terms of the Relationship Agreement in respect of 
Directors appointed by s.a. D'Ieteren n.v.). Non-executive Directors are 
required to offer themselves for election at the next Annual General Meeting 
following their appointment and thereafter for re-election every three years.

Retirement	 benefits
Executive Directors based in the UK can participate in the Avis UK Pension 
Plan. The Plan comprises two sections: the Final Salary section (defined 
benefit) and the Retirement Capital Plan section (cash balance). The non-
contributory Final Salary section was closed to new entrants from 1 July 
2003, and closed to future service accruals for active members from 1 
April 2007. New members to the Plan since 1 July 2003 have joined the 
contributory Retirement Capital Plan section and, from 1 April 2007, active 
members of the Final Salary section accrue their future service benefits 
under the Retirement Capital Plan section. 
Under the Retirement Capital Plan section, for those executive Directors who 
are members of the Plan, an allocation of 25% of their pensionable salary is 
made to a notional account. Each year the account balance is revalued by 
inflation up to 10%, although the Company may at its absolute discretion and 
subject to actuarial advice apply a greater rate of revaluation. At retirement 
the balance in the account will be used to purchase an annuity. Pensionable 
salary for executive Directors excludes bonus payments, taxable benefits and 
cash allowances. 
From 6 April 2006, the HM Revenue & Customs legislation relating to tax-
favoured retirement provisions took effect. From that date Avis introduced 
a scheme specific earnings cap for all members who joined the Plan on or 
after 1 June 1989. For the 2008-09 tax year, the cap is  117,600. Those 
executive Directors whose pensionable salary is subject to the cap receive a 
taxable cash allowance of 20% of base salary above the cap. 
During 2008 three executive Directors accrued benefits under the Avis UK 
Pension Plan and as at 31 December 2008, the retirement benefits are as 
follows. 
Lesley Colyer accrued benefits under the Final Salary section for pensionable 
service until 1 April 2007, and her pensionable service to that date continued 
to be linked to her pensionable salary until she withdrew from pensionable 
service effective 4 July 2008. From 1 April 2007 she accrued benefits in 
the Retirement Capital section until she withdrew from pensionable service 
effective 4 July 2008. Her pensionable salary was not subject to the scheme 
specific earnings cap.
Simon Palethorpe was a member of the Retirement Capital section in respect 
of all his pensionable service until he withdrew from the Plan effective 21 
November 2008. His pensionable salary was subject to the scheme specific 
earnings cap and he received a taxable cash allowance as described above. 
Martyn Smith withdrew from the Plan effective 5 April 2006 and has a 
preserved pension entitlement under the Final Salary section. From that 
date he receives a taxable cash allowance of 20% of base salary in lieu of 
Pension Plan membership. 
Pascal Bazin does not participate in any Avis occupational pension plan.

 310,016 (2007:  301,811). 
2 Lesley Colyer was a former member of the Final Salary section of the Avis UK Pension Plan and elected to join the Retirement Capital Plan section following the Plan changes on 1 April 2007. The 
Retirement Capital Plan section is a cash balance arrangement to which the Director and the Company contribute. Each year, an amount equal to 25% of basic salary is credited to a notional account.  
At 1 April each year after the first year, the account balance is revalued by the rate of inflation over the preceding calendar year, subject to a maximum of 10%. The Company may at its absolute 
discretion and subject to actuarial advice apply a greater rate of revaluation. At retirement the account will have been built up from each year's annual credit plus the annual revaluation amount, and  
the balance in the account will be used to purchase an annuity on behalf of the Director. In the year to 31 December 2008 the value of the Company's contribution to the Retirement Capital Plan  
section in respect of Lesley Colyer was  107,759 (2007:  37,488). Lesley Colyer retired on 4 July 2008 and received a lump sum of  149,198 and pension after reduction for early retirement of

1 In respect of L Colyer and S Palethorpe, who left the Company on 4 July 2008 and 21 November 2008 respectively, the Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion under the Plan rules to  
allow a proportion of their awards under the Plan to vest on the Vesting Date, subject to the performance conditions attached to the awards being satisfied.
Performance conditions
The performance conditions required for vesting purposes are based 50% on the Company's three-year growth in EPS and 50% on ROCE, based on the 
Group's results under the International Financial Reporting Standards. These targets are set such that shares will vest only if performance is between a 
minimum threshold level, where 20% of an award will vest, and the maximum level, where 100% of an award will vest. 
At 31 December 2008, 35 qualifying employees and qualifying former employees, including Executive Directors, held options over 31,274,278 shares in total 
under this Plan. The market price of the Company's shares at 31 December 2008 was 3.93 pence. During the year, the market price ranged between 3.01 
pence and 40.5 pence. 
2006 Deferred Bonus Share Plan
The following awards were made under this Plan on 5 June 2007. The market price of the Company's shares at that date was 60.25 pence. All awards vested 
on 19 March 2008 and were exercised within three months from that date as provided for under the Plan rules. There are no awards outstanding under this 
Plan.

1 Lesley Colyer retired from the Board on 4 July 2008.
Performance conditions
The performance conditions applying to the Performance Share Plan have been based on the performance of the Company in relation to the TSR of a peer 
group, together with an EPS underpin. 
For the awards to vest, TSR at the end of each performance period must be at least at the median in relation to the comparator group and there has to be a 
minimum real increase in EPS of 3% per annum over the relevant period. 
Corporate	 governance 42	 avis-europe.com	 Annual Report 2008
Remuneration	report	 continued
If both these conditions are met, 50% of the award may vest. For full vesting, the EPS target must be met and the Group's TSR must be in the top quartile of 
the comparator group over the seven-year period. TSR achievement between the median and 75th percentile results in vesting between 50% and 100% of the 
award on a pro rata basis. 
The comparator group for TSR for awards made in 2003 comprises the companies listed below: 
Arena Leisure plc, Arriva plc, Associated British Ports Holdings plc, Eurotunnel plc/Eurotunnel SA, First Choice Holidays plc, First Group plc, Go-Ahead Group 
plc, RAC plc, Minorplanet Systems plc, Mitie Group plc, MyTravel Group plc, National Express Group plc, Christian Salvesen plc, Stagecoach Holdings plc, TBI 
plc, Tibbett & Britten Group plc.

4 Gilbert van Marcke de Lummen retired from the Board on 28 May 2008.
5 Malcolm Miller resigned as a Director on 28 May 2008.
Performance conditions
The performance conditions applying to the share option schemes have been based on real growth in EPS. 
Options granted before 2004 become exercisable when real growth in EPS exceeds 3% per annum during any period of three consecutive years following the 
date of grant. Only options shown as having an exercisable date of March 2000 have satisfied this performance condition. 
Options granted in 2004 become exercisable when real growth in EPS during the three-year period 2004 to 2006 exceeds 10% per annum compound. For 
30% of the options to be exercisable there must be real minimum growth of 5% per annum compound. Vesting is on a straight-line basis for EPS growth 
between these targets. There is no re-testing and as the performance conditions relating to options granted in 2004 have not been met, these options have 
lapsed. 
At 31 December 2008, 201 qualifying employees held options over 2,899,221 shares. No options were granted in 2008. The market price of the Company's 
shares at 31 December 2008 was 3.93 pence. During the year, the market price ranged between 3.01 pence and 40.5 pence.
