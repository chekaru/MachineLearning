 3 	 avis-europe.com	 Annual Report 2009
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors' 
Remuneration report and the Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare the Group 
Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and the parent 
Company Financial Statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and 
applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or 
loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these Financial Statements, the 
Directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
   make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
   state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the Group and parent Company 
Financial Statements respectively; and 
   prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the Company's transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and the Group and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements and 
the Directors' Remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the 
Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in their 
biographies on page 28 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
   the Group Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and
   the Business review includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with  
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Directors Report) Regulations 
2008 and the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing 
Authority. The Board has given full consideration to the best practice 
provisions on Directors' remuneration as set out in the Combined Code. As 
required by the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Directors Report) Regulations 2008, a resolution to approve the 
Remuneration report will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting of the Company at which the Financial Statements will be approved. 
Part 1 of this report sets out the Group's policy on executive remuneration 
and explains the various elements of the Directors' remuneration packages. 
Part 2 of this report, which contains the information on which auditors 
are required to report to the Company's shareholders, sets out details of 
Directors' earnings and pension entitlements and fees paid to non-executive 
Directors in 2009. Directors' interests in shares, share incentive awards and 
share options, all of which are beneficial except as noted, are set out on 
pages 39 to 41.

Part		 (Unaudited)
Remuneration	 Committee
Scope
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on 
remuneration for executive Directors and senior management and for 
determining specific remuneration packages for executive Directors and 
members of the Avis Executive Board (AEB). The Committee is constituted 
under terms of reference laid down by the Board. These terms are designed 
to enable the Company to comply with the requirements relating to 
remuneration policy contained in the Combined Code. 
The full terms of reference are set out on the Company's website:  
www.avis-europe.com and are available upon request. 
During 2009, the Remuneration Committee's activities included: 
   review of incentive arrangements for 2009 and 2010 for executive 
Directors, AEB members and senior management; 
   grants of awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan and Share Retention 
Plan; and
  initiating a review of current pension liabilities.
Membership 
The Remuneration Committee is comprised of non-executive Directors. 
Members during the period 1 January 2009 to 3 March 2010 are listed 
below:
 
  Pierre Alain De Smedt (Chairman) 
  Alun Cathcart

Statement	of	Directors'	 responsibilities
Remuneration	report 	 avis-europe.com 	 Annual Report 2009 3 The Remuneration Committee is comprised of the Chairman of the Board 
and four non-executive Directors. All the non-executive Directors on the 
Committee are regarded as independent, except as explained on page 29 
of the Corporate Governance report. The Committee met six times during 
the year and each member's attendance at these meetings is shown in the 
Corporate Governance report on page 30.
Advisers 
During the period under review the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director 
and Group HR Director attended meetings by invitation and provided advice 
to the Committee to assist it in making informed decisions on matters 
relating to Directors' performance and remuneration. No Director was 
present when his or her own remuneration was being discussed. External 
advice was received from Hewitt New Bridge Street (Share Retention Plan), 
Deloitte LLP (Long Term Incentive Plan) and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer 
(share scheme rules). All advisers were appointed by the Company. Other 
than described above, no additional services were provided by the external 
advisers during the year.
Remuneration	 policy
Introduction 
The Group's policy relating to the remuneration and benefits of executive and 
non-executive Directors is reviewed periodically. The executive remuneration 
policy for 2010 is designed to attract, retain and motivate executive and 
senior management to ensure that the Company secures the appropriate 
competencies and experience the Group needs to meet its objectives and 
satisfy shareholder expectations. In general, in determining its policy, the 
Remuneration Committee takes account of market practice, the Group's 
position relative to other companies and the Company's performance.
In response to the difficult economic climate, executive salaries were frozen 
in 2009. Executive Directors and members of the AEB received an annual 
incentive opportunity designed for 50% of salary for on-performance target 
(as defined and agreed by the Remuneration Committee). Executive Directors 
and members of the AEB also received a grant under the Long Term 
Incentive Plan, details of which are set out below.
For 2010 executive salaries were again frozen and the executive Directors 
and members of the AEB have been provided with a similar annual incentive 
opportunity as for 2009. 
Summary of executive Directors' potential direct remuneration 
The Remuneration Committee believes that shareholder interests are 
best served by remuneration packages that have a large component of 
performance-related pay. For 2010 the relationship between fixed and 
variable remuneration for achievement of maximum performance for the Chief 
Executive and for the Group Finance Director is 40% fixed and 60% variable. 
The variable element comprises the annual incentive scheme and an award 
under the Long Term Incentive Plan. The Deputy Chairman, who is also an 
executive Director, has a service contract with an annual fee only.
Salary 
The 2009-10 policy is that salary reviews may take place on a country basis 
as appropriate, whilst a salary freeze will be implemented for executive 
Directors and members of the AEB. 
Annual incentive bonus 
Annual incentive bonus plans for executive Directors and key senior 
management are based on achievement of targets approved by the 
Remuneration Committee and related directly to the annual profit plan 
approved by the Board. Targets and performance measures are quantitative 
and there is a financial threshold below which no bonus payment is made. 
In 2010, 80% of the bonus is based on stretching financial targets and 
20% on achievement of quantitative individual objectives, which include the 
leadership of key group initiatives.
The base salary, bonus payments and value of benefits in kind for each 
Director are set out in the Directors' emoluments table on page 39. Bonus 
payments, benefits in kind and cash allowances do not form part of 
pensionable earnings for Directors.
Share	 incentive	 policy	 The Remuneration Committee sets policy with regard to share incentives with 
the objective of aligning incentive plans with the Group's medium term plan 
and shareholders' interests.
Shareholding guidelines implemented in 2005 require executive Directors to 
build up their personal holdings of shares in the Company. The guidelines 
are 150% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of salary for the Group 
Finance Director. The Remuneration Committee requires executives to retain 
50% of any vested shares (net of tax and exercise costs) arising from any 
share incentive scheme until the shareholding requirement is achieved. 
Outstanding share plans 
Outstanding share plans are as follows: Long Term Incentive Plan (last 
award 2009); Share Retention Plan (last award 2009); Performance Share 
Plan (last award April 2004); and Share Option Schemes (last award April 
2004). A description of each of these plans is set out below. The assessment 
of whether performance conditions have been met is verified by the 
Remuneration Committee at the time of vesting. 
Individual Directors' share incentive awards are set out pages 40 to 41. 
Long Term Incentive Plan 
The Long Term Incentive Plan, introduced in 2007, comprises awards of 
ordinary shares in the Company, structured as nil cost options or conditional 
awards. Awards vest three years after grant, providing certain performance 
conditions are met. It is intended that there will be annual grants of awards 
under this Plan.
The performance conditions required for vesting purposes are based on 
tranches of 50% in respect of the Group's three-year growth in earnings per 
share (EPS) and 50% in respect of return on capital employed (ROCE). If one 
or both of the performance targets are not met at the end of the performance 
period, 50% or 100% (as appropriate) of the award will lapse immediately.

EPS is calculated on an underlying basis i.e. excluding exceptional items, 
certain re-measurement items and economic hedge items. However, the 
Remuneration Committee has discretion to adjust for any exceptional items 
which it deems to be within management control, if appropriate, to ensure the 
outcome is fair to both shareholders and executives. The basis of the ROCE 
calculation is included in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
EPS represents a complete measure of financial performance, capturing both 
interest and tax, and is closely tracked by many of the Company's investors. 
Car rental is highly asset intensive and the Remuneration Committee 
wishes management to be focussed on improving the return the Company 
achieves on this capital. Management will focus on the key drivers of ROCE 
- asset turn and operating margin. The two measures of EPS and ROCE 
are considered by the Remuneration Committee to be the most relevant 
all-encompassing long-term performance measures for Avis Europe, in that 
the ultimate aim of the business of the Group is to achieve a good economic 
return on renting its fleet of vehicles. 
Participation is at the Remuneration Committee's discretion. In 2009 awards 
were made to all members of the AEB, which included two of the executive 
Directors, and to 37 senior managers. Maximum awards are capped at 
100% of salary (150% for the Chief Executive) (see page 40). Dividends, 
as and when reinstated, will not accrue on the awards made to date, but 
it is anticipated that for awards granted in future, dividends would accrue 
and be paid only on shares that vest. Outstanding awards will vest and 
become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any 
performance conditions at that time.
Share	 Retention	 Plan	 On 1 May 2009 the Share Retention Plan was established as a one-off 
discretionary benefit for the sole purpose of retaining the services of the 
Chief Executive. The Remuneration Committee views the contribution of the 
Chief Executive as essential to lead the Group through the current economic 
downturn and into the recovery, and therefore determined that it was 
appropriate to implement this plan to facilitate his retention over the medium 
term. A similar plan was implemented on a previous occasion. 
The principal terms of the Plan are as follows. The sole participant is the 
Chief Executive and the award is in the form of a conditional share award 
to acquire ordinary shares in the Company. The Plan was implemented 
in accordance with section 9.4.2R(2) of the Listing Rules. In normal 
circumstances the award will vest in three equal tranches on 1 May 2010, 
1 May 2011 and 1 May 2012, provided that the Chief Executive is still 
employed by the Group and is not subject to notice of termination of his 
employment (whether given or received) on these dates. There are no 
performance conditions relating to this award.
Remuneration	report	 continued 	 avis-europe.com 	 Annual Report 2009 37
The award will normally lapse on cessation of employment (save on death, 
when the award will vest in full). If employment ceases by reason of injury 
or disability, or for any other reason if the Remuneration Committee so 
decides, the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to decide whether 
or not the award will vest and, if so, the extent to which it will vest. In the 
event of a takeover, the Remuneration Committee will decide the extent to 
which any outstanding part of the award will vest. In the event of a corporate 
reorganisation, the Remuneration Committee may decide that the award 
continues over the shares of any new holding company.
If there is a demerger or other corporate event which, in the opinion of the 
Remuneration Committee, will materially affect the share price, then the 
Remuneration Committee may decide that the award vests early. In the 
event of any increase or variation in the share capital of the Company, the 
payment of a capital dividend or other event similarly affecting the award, the 
number of shares subject to the award may be adjusted. The Remuneration 
Committee may alter the Plan at any time.
Performance Share Plan 
No awards under this Plan have been made since April 2004 and it is not 
anticipated that awards will be made in the future. The Performance Share 
Plan is a seven-year plan, and was designed to encourage executives to 
focus on longer-term performance and growth in shareholder value. A 
combination of performance targets was chosen for the measurement of the 
Company's performance, being total shareholder return (TSR) and earnings 
per share (EPS). EPS performance is calculated from the audited accounts 
and TSR is calculated by external remuneration consultants. 
Awards were determined by the Remuneration Committee and could not be 
greater than 100% of the qualifying participant's total annual remuneration 
measured at the date of the award. No award granted to date has exceeded 
one times annual salary. Awards vest over a period of seven years from the 
date of the award. If the performance conditions are met at each of the third 
and fifth anniversary of the date of award, vesting accelerates to the extent 
of 25% of the award on each of these occasions. No awards can vest unless 
the EPS target is achieved. The extent to which an award vests is determined 
by the Group's medium and long-term performance measured in terms 
of TSR. TSR was measured against a broad comparator group from the 
Transport and Support Services sectors. 
On a change of control the Remuneration Committee would take into account 
the performance conditions when determining the vesting of awards.
Share option schemes 
No options have been granted under these schemes since April 2004, 
and it is not anticipated that awards will be made in the future. Further 
details of share options are set out in Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 
The schemes comprise Inland Revenue approved and unapproved share 
option schemes which have an EPS based performance condition. Employees 
may not normally exercise options earlier than three years, nor more than 
10 years after the grant (seven years for grants made before April 2000 
for the unapproved scheme). Options lapse upon cessation of employment. 
However, special conditions apply if employment ceases because of death, 
injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the employing business 
or company is transferred outside the Group, or for any other reason at 
the discretion of the Board. Outstanding options will vest and become 
exercisable on a change of control and with the exception of the UK 
Approved Share Option Scheme, any options vesting will, at the discretion 
of the Remuneration Committee, be subject to the satisfaction of any 
performance conditions at that time. 
Options (all of which were granted prior to 2004) become exercisable 
when real growth in EPS exceeds 3% per annum during any period of 
three consecutive years following the date of grant. The rules of the share 
option schemes limit the number of options that can be granted over new 
issue shares in a rolling 10-year period to 5% of issued share capital under 
discretionary share schemes, and 10% of issued share capital under all 
share schemes. The total number of share options outstanding at  
31 December 2009 is well within these dilution limits (see page 41).
Avis Europe Employee Share Trust 
The Avis Europe Employee Share Trust was established in March 2000  
to facilitate provision of shares for the Company's share incentive schemes. 
The Trust may hold up to 5% of the issued share capital of the Company  
at any one time. 
At 31 December 2009, the Trust held 7,307,735 shares. It is intended that 
the shares in the Trust will be used to satisfy share awards made under the 
Company's various share incentive schemes as and when these awards vest. 
The awards outstanding under each of the relevant plans at 31 December 
2008 and 31 December 2009 are set out below: 
 
  Share awards  Share awards  
 outstanding at   outstanding at
Share Incentive Scheme  31 December 2009 31 December 2008
Performance Share Plan  514,875 shares 514,875 shares
Long Term Incentive Plan  54,426,596 shares 31,274,278 shares
Share Retention Plan  1,055,662 shares  -
Total  55,997,133 shares 31,789,153 shares
The Company periodically reviews the number of shares held by the Trust 
in light of the anticipated vesting dates and performance conditions under 
the various plans. The Company also regularly reviews its hedging policy 
but does not currently hedge any of these awards against potential Social 
Security costs that may be incurred across the Group as and when the 
awards vest.

Total	 shareholder	 return	 (TSR)
The graph below illustrates the performance of Avis Europe plc and a broad 
equity market index  over the past five years. As Avis Europe plc has been a 
constituent of the FTSE All Share Index throughout this five-year period, that 
index is considered the most appropriate form of broad equity market index  
against which the Group's performance should be graphed. As required by 
legislation, performance is measured by total shareholder return (share price 
plus dividends paid). 
 
All dates at 31 December.
This graph shows the value, by the end of 2009, of  100 invested in Avis Europe plc on 31 
December 2004 compared with the value of  100 invested in the FTSE All Share Index. The other 
points plotted are the values at intervening financial year ends. 
Non-executive	 Directors	 Non-executive Directors' fees are positioned to attract non-executives 
with broad business and commercial experience and to be competitive in 
the marketplace. The Chairman's fee is determined by the Remuneration 
Committee. The Chairman and the Chief Executive set the remuneration 
of non-executive Directors based on periodic review of current survey 
data. Policy is to pay an annual fee of  32,500 with an additional fee for 
chairmanship of a Committee. Non-executive Directors do not receive awards 
under the Company's share incentive schemes.
Service	 contracts
Executive Directors 
The Company's policy is to employ each executive Director under a service 
contract which is subject to 12 months' notice on either side and runs until 
terminated. The contract provides for salary to be paid for any unexpired 
period of notice in the event of termination by the Company. Compensation 
for contractual benefits and bonus for the unexpired period of notice is at 
the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. There is no compensation for 
loss of rights under the share and pension schemes. All contracts contain 
mitigation provisions. There are no special contractual payments associated 
with change of control. 
All executive Directors have service contracts in line with policy as shown.

The Board believes that it can be of benefit to Avis Europe if its executive 
Directors serve as non-executive Directors of other companies, and, subject 
to individual review, the general policy is that an executive Director may hold 
one non-executive directorship with another company and may retain the 
fees. During the year ended 31 December 2009, no executive Director held 
any external directorships. 
Non-executive Directors 
The Company's policy is to engage non-executive Directors on renewable 
three-year terms, which can be terminated by either party at any time 
without penalty (subject to the terms of the Relationship Agreement in 
respect of Directors appointed by s.a. D'Ieteren n.v.). Non-executive  
Directors are required to offer themselves for election at the next Annual 
General Meeting following their appointment and thereafter for re-election 
every three years.

Retirement	 benefits
Executive Directors based in the UK can participate in the Avis UK Pension 
Plan although none of the executive Directors accrued benefits under the 
Avis UK Pension Plan during 2009.
Martyn Smith withdrew from the Plan effective 5 April 2006 and has a 
preserved pension entitlement under the Final Salary section. From that 
date he receives a taxable cash allowance of 20% of base salary in lieu of 
Pension Plan membership. The Final Salary section of the Plan was closed to 
new entrants with effect from 1 July 2003. 
Pascal Bazin does not participate in any Avis occupational pension plan.

Performance conditions
The performance conditions required for vesting purposes are based 50% on the Company's three-year growth in earnings per share (EPS) and 50% on return 
on capital employed (ROCE), based on the Group's results under the International Financial Reporting Standards. These targets are set such that shares will 
vest only if performance is between a minimum threshold level, where 20% of an award will vest, and the maximum level, where 100% of an award will vest.

1 The awards held by Alun Cathcart were granted when he was an executive Director of the Company.
Performance conditions
The performance conditions applying to the Performance Share Plan have been based on the performance of the Company in relation to the total shareholder 
return (TSR) of a peer group, together with an earnings per share (EPS) underpin. 
For the awards to vest, TSR at the end of each performance period must be at least at the median in relation to the comparator group and there has to be a 
minimum real increase in EPS of 3% per annum over the relevant period.  	 avis-europe.com 	 Annual Report 2009  If both these conditions are met, 50% of the award may vest. For full vesting, the EPS target must be met and the Group's TSR must be in the top quartile of 
the comparator group over the seven-year period. TSR achievement between the median and 75th percentile results in vesting between 50% and 100% of the 
award on a pro rata basis. 
The comparator group for the TSR for awards disclosed above comprises the companies listed below: 
Arena Leisure plc, Arriva plc, Associated British Ports Holdings plc, Eurotunnel plc/Eurotunnel SA, First Choice Holidays plc, First Group plc, Go-Ahead Group 
plc, RAC plc, Minorplanet Systems plc, Mitie Group plc, MyTravel Group plc, National Express Group plc, Christian Salvesen plc, Stagecoach Holdings plc, TBI 
plc, Tibbett & Britten Group plc.

1 The share options held by Alun Cathcart were granted when he was an executive Director of the Company.
Performance conditions
The performance conditions applying to the share option schemes have been based on real growth in earnings per share (EPS). 
Options granted before 2004 (including the awards disclosed above) become exercisable when real growth in EPS exceeds 3% per annum during any period of 
three consecutive years following the date of grant, but have not satisfied this performance condition. 
Options granted in 2004 become exercisable when real growth in EPS during the three-year period 2004 to 2006 exceeds 10% per annum compound. For 
30% of the options to be exercisable there must be real minimum growth of 5% per annum compound. Vesting is on a straight-line basis for EPS growth 
between these targets. There is no re-testing and as the performance conditions relating to options granted in 2004 have not been met, these options have 
lapsed. 
At 31 December 2009, 190 qualifying employees held options over 2,580,427 shares. No options were granted in 2009. The market price of the Company's 
shares at 31 December 2009 was 26.25 pence. During the year, the market price ranged between 2.5 pence and 42.25 pence.
