determining specific remuneration packages for executive Directors and 
members of the Avis Executive Board (AEB). t he Committee is constituted 
under terms of reference laid down by the Board. t hese terms are designed 
to enable the Company to comply with the requirements relating to 
remuneration policy contained in the Code. 
t he full terms of reference are set out on the Company's website: www.avis-
europe.com and are available upon request. 
During 2010, the Remuneration Committee's activities included: 
   review of incentive arrangements for 2010 and 2011 for executive 
Directors, AEB members and senior management 
  grants of awards under the Long t erm Incentive Plan

incentive schemes to reflect the impact of the Rights Issue and share 
consolidation completed in July 2010
  approving certain changes to senior country management and roles
   overseeing a consultation process regarding the Company's uK Pension 
Plan
  review of the Committee's performance in 2010. 
Membership 
t he membership of the Remuneration Committee is set out in the Corporate 
governance report on page 27. 
t he Remuneration Committee is comprised of the Chairman of the Board 
and four non-executive Directors. All the non-executive Directors on the 
Committee are regarded as independent, except as explained on page 27 of 
the Corporate governance report. t he Committee met seven times during 
the year and each member's attendance at these meetings is shown in the 
Corporate governance report on page 28. 
t here were no changes to the composition of the Board or the Committee in 
the period 1 January 2010 - 25 February 2011. 
t he Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors' 
Remuneration Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each 
financial year. under that law the Directors have prepared the group Financial 
Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European union, and the Parent Company 
Financial Statements in accordance with united Kingdom generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (united Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
law). under company law the Directors must not approve the Financial 
Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
group for that period. In preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors 
are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
   make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent
   state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European union and applicable 
uK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the group and Parent Company 
Financial Statements respectively, and
   prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
t he Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the Company's transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and the group and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements 
and the Directors' Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. t hey are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
t he Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company's website. Legislation in the united Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in their 
biographies on page 25 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
   the group Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the Eu, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the group, and
   the Business review includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces. 	 avis-europe.com 	 Annual Report 2010 35
Advisers 
During the period under review the Chief Executive, group Finance Director 
and group HR Director attended meetings by invitation and provided advice 
to the Committee to assist it in making informed decisions on relevant 
matters. No Director was present when his own remuneration was being 
discussed. External advice was received from Deloitte LLP (Long t erm 
Incentive Plan), Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer (share scheme adjustments) 
and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (share scheme adjustments). All advisers 
were appointed by the Company. o ther than described above, no additional 
services were provided by the external advisers during the year. 
Remuneration	 policy
Introduction 
t he group's executive remuneration policy for 2011 is designed to attract, 
retain and motivate executive and senior management to ensure that the 
group secures the appropriate competencies and experience needed to 
meet its objectives and satisfy shareholder expectations. In general, in 
determining its policy, the Remuneration Committee takes account of market 
practice, the group's position relative to other companies and the Company's 
performance.
t he Remuneration Committee believes that shareholder interests are best 
served by executive remuneration packages that have a large component 
of performance-related pay linked to annual performance. For 2011 the 
relationship between fixed and variable remuneration for achievement 
of maximum performance is 30% fixed and 70% variable for the Chief 
Executive and 40% fixed and 60% variable for the group Finance Director. 
t he variable element comprises an annual incentive bonus scheme and an 
award under the Long t erm Incentive Plan. t he Deputy Chairman, who is 
also an executive Director, has a service contract with an annual fee only.
Salary 
In response to the prevailing difficult economic climate, executive salaries 
were frozen in 2010. Executive Directors and members of the AEB were 
granted an incentive opportunity for the year designed to deliver 50% of 
salary for on-target performance (as defined and agreed by the Remuneration 
Committee). Executive Directors and members of the AEB also received a 
grant under the Long t erm Incentive Plan, details of which are set out below.
For 2011 salaries for executive Directors and the AEB have again not 
been increased and an annual incentive opportunity is being provided on a 
similar basis to 2010. In recognition of this continuing freeze of base salary, 
the Remuneration Committee has, however, approved an increase in the 
percentage of base salary for the Lt IP grants to be made in 2011 from 
75% to 150% for the Chief Executive and from 50% to 100% for the group 
Finance Director and other AEB members. 
For all other employees, the 2011 policy is that salary reviews may take place 
on a country and business unit basis, depending on market conditions and 
performance. 
Annual incentive bonus 
Annual incentive bonus plans for executive Directors and key senior 
management are based on achievement of both profit and return on capital 
employed targets approved by the Remuneration Committee and related directly 
to the annual plan approved by the Board. t argets and performance measures 
are quantitative and there is a financial threshold below which no bonus payment 
is made. Bonuses are paid following finalisation of the applicable year's results, 
at which point the quantum of bonuses is established. 
In 2011, as in the previous year, 80% of the bonus is based on appropriately 
stretching financial targets and 20% on achievement of quantitative individual 
objectives, which include contribution to the delivery of key group initiatives. 
t he base salary, bonus payments and value of benefits in kind for each 
Director are set out in the Directors' emoluments table on page 39. 
A summary is also provided in Note 37 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, together with the remuneration of other key management (being 
other AEB members). Bonus payments, benefits in kind and cash allowances 
do not form part of pensionable earnings for Directors.
Share	 incentive	 policy	
t he Remuneration Committee sets policy with regard to share incentives 
with the objective of aligning the interests of shareholders and management 
in growing the value of the business over the longer term. It does this by 
granting share awards which vest depending on the extent to which the 
business meets targets for both earnings and return on capital over a 
three-year period; the value of the incentive to an executive is also heavily 
dependent on the level of share price appreciation over the period, also 
helping to align the interests of the executive and the shareholders. An 
additional feature of the share incentive policy is that it acts as a highly 
effective retention tool.
t he Company is proposing to adopt a new uK HM Revenue & Customs 
approved scheme, the Avis Europe Long t erm Approved Share o ption Plan,   
in order to give scope for tax-effective grants to uK participants. A resolution 
to this effect will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual general Meeting.
Shareholding guidelines implemented in 2005 require executive Directors to 
build up their personal holdings of shares in the Company. t he guidelines 
are 150% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of salary for the group 
Finance Director. t he Remuneration Committee requires executives to retain 
50% of any vested shares (net of tax and exercise costs) arising from any 
share incentive scheme until the shareholding requirement is achieved.
Rights Issue and share consolidation
Pursuant to the Company's 9 for 8 Rights Issue in July 2010 and subsequent 
10 for 1 share consolidation, the Remuneration Committee approved a 
number of adjustments to existing awards made under the Company's share 
incentive plans, details of which are set out below. In each case, adjustments 
were designed to maintain unchanged the economic terms of the grants 
made under the plans.
o utstanding share plans 
o utstanding share plans are as follows: Long t erm Incentive Plan (last award 
2010); Share Retention Plan (last award 2009); and Share o ption Schemes 
(last award April 2004). A description of each of these plans is set out below. 
During the year all outstanding awards under the Performance Share Plan 
lapsed. t he assessment of whether performance conditions have been met is 
verified by the Remuneration Committee at the time of vesting. 
Individual Directors' share incentive awards are set out pages 40 to 41. 
Long t erm Incentive Plan
t he Long t erm Incentive Plan, introduced in 2007, comprises awards of 
ordinary shares in the Company, structured as nil cost options or conditional 
awards. Awards vest three years after grant, providing certain performance 
conditions are met. It is intended that there will be annual grants of awards 
under this Plan.

t he performance conditions required for vesting purposes are based on 
tranches of 50% in respect of the group's three-year growth in earnings 
per share (EPS) and 50% in respect of return on capital employed (Ro CE) 
performance. If one or both of the performance targets are not met at the 
end of the performance period, 50% or 100% (as appropriate) of the award 
will lapse on vesting.

t he performance targets for awards granted under the Plan in 2007 were not 
satisfied and accordingly the awards made in 2007 lapsed on 4 June 2010.
EPS is calculated on an underlying basis i.e. excluding exceptional items, 
certain re-measurement items and economic hedge items. However, the 
Remuneration Committee has discretion to adjust for any exceptional items 
which it deems to be within management control, if appropriate, to ensure 
the outcome is fair to both shareholders and executives. t he basis of the 
Ro CE calculation is included in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. t he Remuneration Committee believes that EPS represents 
a complete measure of financial performance, capturing both interest and 
tax, and is closely tracked by many of the Company's investors. Car rental 
is highly asset intensive and the Remuneration Committee also wishes 
management to be focussed on improving the return the Company achieves 
on this capital.
Participation is at the Remuneration Committee's discretion. In 2010 awards 
were made to all members of the AEB, which included two of the executive 
Directors, and to 39 senior managers. Maximum awards are capped at 
100% of salary (150% for the Chief Executive) (see page 40). Dividends, 
as and when reinstated, will not accrue on the awards made to date, but 
it is anticipated that for awards granted in future, dividends would accrue 
but be paid only on shares that vest. o utstanding awards will vest and 
become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any 
performance conditions at that time.
Following the Company's 9 for 8 Rights Issue and subsequent 10:1 share 
consolidation, the Remuneration Committee approved certain adjustments  
to the awards outstanding: (1) the number of shares comprised in the  
awards was adjusted by a multiple of 0.1352; (2) the EPS performance 
condition was adjusted to reflect the impact of the Rights Issue on EPS  
(no change was made to the Ro CE performance condition). All awards were 
granted at a nil exercise price and therefore no adjustment to the exercise 
price was necessary. 	 avis-europe.com 	 Annual Report 2010 37
Share Retention Plan 
o n 1 May 2009 the Share Retention Plan was established as a one-off 
discretionary benefit for the sole purpose of retaining the services of the 
Chief Executive.
t he principal terms of the Plan are as follows. t he sole participant is the 
Chief Executive and the award is in the form of a conditional share award 
of ordinary shares in the Company. t he Plan provides that in normal 
circumstances the award vests in three equal tranches on 1 May 2010, 
1 May 2011 and 1 May 2012, provided that the Chief Executive is still 
employed by the group and is not subject to notice of termination of his 
employment (whether given or received) on these dates. t here are no 
performance conditions relating to this award.
Following the Company's 9 for 8 Rights Issue and subsequent 10:1 share 
consolidation, the Remuneration Committee approved an adjustment to the 
outstanding tranches of the award whereby the number of shares in each 
tranche was adjusted by a multiple of 0.1352.
t he award will normally lapse on cessation of employment (save on death, 
when the award will vest in full). If employment ceases by reason of injury 
or disability, or for any other reason if the Remuneration Committee so 
decides, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to decide whether 
or not the award will vest and, if so, the extent to which it will vest. In the 
event of a takeover, the Remuneration Committee will decide the extent to 
which any outstanding part of the award will vest. In the event of a corporate 
reorganisation, the Remuneration Committee may decide that the award 
continues over the shares of any new holding company.
If there is a demerger or other corporate event which, in the opinion of the 
Remuneration Committee, will materially affect the share price, then the 
Remuneration Committee may decide that the award vests early. In the 
event of any increase or variation in the share capital of the Company, the 
payment of a capital dividend or other event similarly affecting the award, the 
number of shares subject to the award may be adjusted. t he Remuneration 
Committee may alter the Plan at any time.
Performance Share Plan 
No awards under this Plan have been made since April 2004 and no 
further grants can be made as the Plan has now expired. t he performance 
conditions relating to all outstanding awards have not been satisfied and 
accordingly all outstanding awards under the Performance Share Plan lapsed 
with effect from 17 March 2010.
Share option schemes
No options have been granted under these schemes since April 2004, 
and no further grants can be made as the schemes have now expired. 
Further details of outstanding share options are set out in Note 31 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 
t he schemes comprise Inland Revenue approved and unapproved share 
option schemes which have an EPS based performance condition. Employees 
may not normally exercise options earlier than three years, nor more than 
10 years after the grant (seven years for grants made before April 2000 
for the unapproved scheme). o ptions lapse upon cessation of employment. 
However, special conditions apply if employment ceases because of death, 
injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the employing business 
or company is transferred outside the group, or for any other reason at the 
discretion of the Board. o utstanding options will vest and become  
exercisable on a change of control and, with the exception of the uK 
Approved Share o ption Scheme, any options vesting will, at the discretion 
of the Remuneration Committee, be subject to the satisfaction of any 
performance conditions at that time.
t he performance conditions relating to these schemes required that real 
growth in EPS should exceed 3% per annum during any period of three 
consecutive years following the date of grant. t he performance conditions 
relating to the outstanding options (all of which were granted prior to 2004) 
have been satisfied.
In order to reflect the impact of the Company's 9 for 8 Rights Issue, the 
Remuneration Committee approved the following adjustments: (1) for awards 
outstanding under the Avis International Share o ption Scheme and the Avis 
uK unapproved Share o ption Scheme, the number of shares comprised 
in the award was adjusted by a multiple of 1.352, with the exercise price 
adjusted by the inverse; (2) for awards outstanding under the Avis uK 
Approved Share o ption Scheme, the number of shares comprised in the 
award was adjusted by a multiple of 1.335 in accordance with the rules 
of the scheme, with the exercise price adjusted by the inverse; and (3) for 
awards outstanding under the French Share o ption Scheme, the number 
of shares comprised in the award was adjusted by a multiple of 1.339 in 
accordance with the rules of the scheme, with the exercise price adjusted by 
the inverse. For all schemes, the number of shares comprised in awards was 
then reduced by a factor of 10 to reflect the share consolidation.
t he rules of the share option schemes limit the number of options that 
can be granted over new issue shares in a rolling 10-year period to 5% of 
issued share capital under discretionary share schemes, and 10% of issued 
share capital under all share schemes. t he total number of share options 
outstanding at 31 December 2010 is well within these dilution limits (see 
page 41). 
Avis Europe Employee Share t rust 
t he Avis Europe Employee Share t rust was established in March 2000 to 
facilitate provision of shares for the Company's share incentive schemes. t he 
t rust may hold up to 5% of the issued share capital of the Company at any 
one time. 
At 31 December 2010, the t rust held 1,478,117 ordinary shares of 10 pence 
each. It is intended that the shares in the t rust will be used to satisfy share 
awards made under the Company's various share incentive schemes as and 
when these awards vest. t he awards outstanding under each of the relevant 
plans at 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2010 are set out below.

t he Company periodically reviews the number of shares held by the t rust 
in light of the anticipated vesting dates and performance conditions under 
the various plans. t he Company also regularly reviews its hedging policy 
but does not currently hedge any of these awards against potential Social 
Security costs that may be incurred across the group as and when the 
awards vest. 
Total	 shareholder	 return	 (TSR)
t he graph below illustrates the performance of Avis Europe plc and a broad 
equity market index  over the past five years. As Avis Europe plc has been a 
constituent of the Ft SE All Share Index throughout this five-year period, that 
index is considered the most appropriate form of broad equity market index  
against which the group's performance should be graphed. As required by 
legislation, performance is measured by total shareholder return (share price 
plus dividends paid).
 
All dates at 31 December.
t his graph shows the value, by the end of 2010, of  100 invested in Avis Europe plc on 31 
December 2005 compared with the value of  100 invested in the Ft SE All Share Index. t he other 
points plotted are the values at intervening financial year ends.
   
Non-executive	 Directors	
Non-executive Directors' fees are positioned to attract non-executives 
with broad business and commercial experience and to be competitive in 
the marketplace. t he Chairman's fee is determined by the Remuneration 
Committee. t he Chairman and the Chief Executive set the remuneration 
of non-executive Directors based on periodic review of current survey 
data. Policy is to pay an annual fee of  32,500 with an additional fee for 
chairmanship of a Committee. Non-executive Directors do not receive awards 
under the Company's share incentive schemes. 
Service	 Contracts
Executive Directors 
t he Company's policy is to employ each executive Director under a service 
contract which is subject to 12 months' notice on either side and runs until 
terminated. t he contract provides for salary to be paid for any unexpired 
period of notice in the event of termination by the Company. Compensation 
for contractual benefits and bonus for the unexpired period of notice is at 
the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. t here is no compensation for 
loss of rights under the share and pension schemes. All contracts contain 
mitigation provisions. t here are no special contractual payments associated 
with change of control. 
All executive Directors have service contracts in line with policy as shown.

1 t he Deputy Chairman, who is also an executive Director, has a service contract with an annual

governance report on page 26).
t he Board believes that it can be of benefit to the group as a whole for 
the executive Directors to broaden their experience through service as a 
non-executive Director of other businesses. Subject to individual review, 
group policy is that executive Directors may hold one non-executive 
directorship in another business and may retain the fees. During the year 
ended 31 December 2010, none of the executive Directors held any relevant 
appointments. t he policy does not apply to the role of executive Deputy 
Chairman which is an appointment made under the Relationship Agreement 
with s.a. D'Ieteren n.v. nor to charitable or other pro bono appointments.
Non-executive Directors 
t he Company's policy is to engage non-executive Directors on renewable 
three-year terms, which can be terminated by either party at any time without 
penalty (subject to the terms of the Relationship Agreement in respect of 
Directors appointed by s.a. D'Ieteren n.v.).

Retirement	 benefits
Executive Directors based in the uK can participate in the Avis uK Pension 
Plan although none of the executive Directors accrued benefits under the Avis 
uK Pension Plan during 2010.
Martyn Smith withdrew from the Plan effective 5 April 2006 and has a 
preserved pension entitlement under the Final Salary section. From that date 
he has received a taxable cash allowance of 20% of base salary in lieu of 
Pension Plan membership. t he Final Salary section of the Plan was closed to 
new entrants with effect from 1 July 2003.
