Report on Directors' Remuneration
The Remuneration committee is chaired by N G McNair
Scott. Its other members are Sir Richard Brooke Bt., J D
Pollock, J F Newman and R A Pilkington. All members of
the committee are independent non-executive directors.
The committee determines an overall remuneration
package for executive directors in order to attract and
retain high quality executives.
None of the committee has any personal financial interest
in the matters to be decided, (other than as shareholders),
potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-
directorships, nor any day-to-day involvement in running
the business. The committee consults the chief executive
about its proposals and has access to professional advice
from inside and outside the Company.
Policy on Executive Directors'
Remuneration
The Company operates within a competitive environment
and its performance depends on the individual
contributions of the directors and employees.
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract,
motivate and retain directors of the calibre necessary to
manage the Group's operations and to reward them for
enhancing shareholder value. The performance
measurement of the executive directors and the
determination of their annual remuneration package is
undertaken by the committee.
The executive directors' remuneration packages may include:
(i) basic annual salary
(ii) benefits
(iii) pension contributions
(iv) annual cash and deferred share bonus payments
(v) share options
(vi) long-term share incentives.
Each executive director's basic salary and pension
contributions are reviewed annually by the committee. In
deciding upon appropriate levels of remuneration the
committee has regard to rates of pay for similar jobs in
comparable companies as well as internal factors such as
performance. Executive directors' basic salaries were last
reviewed with effect from 1 July 2004. 
The committee establishes the objectives which must be
met for a cash and deferred share bonus to be paid. The
committee believes that the award of any annual bonuses
should be tied to the interests of the Company's
shareholders and that the principal measure of those
interests is shareholder value. 
The executive directors may participate in share incentive
schemes recommended by the Remuneration committee
for the Group's key employees. 
Long Term Employee Share
Awards
The Company has established an offshore Employee
Benefit Trust (EBT ) and a UK Share Incentive Plan
(SIP ). These plans were set up in order to reward
employees for the performance of the Company on a long
term basis and to enable the Company to continue to
attract a high calibre of management and operational
personnel. Any awards under the EBT and SIP are
approved by the Remuneration committee and members
of the plans must continue in the Company's employment
for at least one year in order for the shares to vest. As of
20 July 2004 both plans held a combined total of
1,365,000 shares of the Company which have been
purchased in the market.

The options are exercisable between three and seven
years of being issued subject to performance conditions
requiring growth in the Company's net assets per share,
and returns to shareholders by way of share price increase
and dividends being in excess of at least half of the
companies in the FTSE Gold Mines Index. Currently the
scheme does not permit the issue of more than five per
cent of the Company's share capital by way of these
options. The current scheme also limits awards to
individuals to four times salary, where the options are
valued at market value at any given time, for any ten
year period. The Company will be asking shareholders
to approve various amendments to the current share
option scheme at the Company's next AGM. More details
can be found in the Notice of Meeting on pages 58 to 60.

plan. For the financial year under review the Remuneration committee has approved the issue of EBT shares as deferred
share bonus payments to be issued over a three year period to J T Catchpole (174,091 shares), J G Henry (135,404 shares)

Pension contributions are not paid on their behalf. Statement, the Review of Operations, the Financial
Review and the Report on Directors' Remuneration. We
consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent mis-statements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements. We are
not required to consider whether the Board's statements
on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control
procedures. Our responsibilities do not extend to any
other information.
Basis of Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United
Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes
an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of
the financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Group's circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all
the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence
to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements are free from material mis-statement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the
Group at 31 March 2004 and of the profit of the Group
for the year then ended and have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
