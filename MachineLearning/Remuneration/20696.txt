The 2004 Remuneration Report was approved by shareholders at the September 2004 AGM. 
The Remuneration committee is chaired by N G McNair Scott. Its other members are Sir Richard Brooke Bt., J D Pollock, J F Newman
and R A Pilkington. All members of the committee are independent non-executive directors. The committee determines an overall
remuneration package for executive directors in order to attract and retain high quality executives.
None of the committee has any personal financial interest in the matters to be decided, other than as shareholders, potential conflicts of
interest arising from cross-directorships, nor any day-to-day involvement in running the business. The committee consults the Chief
Executive about its proposals and has access to professional advice from inside and outside the Company.
Executive directors' remuneration
Policy on executive directors' remuneration
The Company operates within a competitive environment and its performance depends on the individual contributions of the directors and
employees.
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the calibre necessary to manage the Group's
operations and to reward them for enhancing shareholder value. The performance measurement of the executive directors and the
determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the committee.
The executive directors' remuneration packages may include:
(i) basic annual salary
(ii) benefits
(iii) pension contributions
(iv) annual cash and deferred share bonus payments
(v) share options
(vi) long-term share incentives.
Each executive director's basic salary and pension contributions are reviewed annually by the committee. In deciding upon appropriate
levels of remuneration the committee has regard to rates of pay for similar jobs in comparable companies as well as internal factors such
as performance. Executive directors' basic salaries were last reviewed with effect from 1 July 2005. 
The committee establishes the objectives which must be met for a cash and deferred share bonus to be paid. The committee believes
that the award of any annual bonuses should be tied to the interests of the Company's shareholders and that the principal measure of
those interests is shareholder value. 
The executive directors may participate in share incentive schemes recommended by the Remuneration committee for the Group's
key employees. 
Non-executive directors' remuneration
Chairman's fees and letter of appointment
It is Avocet Mining's policy that the Chairman should be remunerated on a competitive basis and at a level which reflects his contribution
to the Group, as assessed by the Board. He does not participate in the Group's pension arrangements and a formal letter of appointment
setting out his duties and responsibilities is available for inspection at the Company's registered office and AGM. Details of his fees can
be found on page 39.
Non-executive directors' fees and letters of appointment
The Board as a whole, with the benefit of independent professional advice, determines non-executive directors' fees, although non-
executive directors do not vote on any increases of their own fees. Fees are set to reflect the responsibilities and time spent by the
directors on the affairs of the Company. They do not participate in the Group's pension arrangements. Non-executive directors have a
formal letter of appointment setting out their duties and responsibilities which are available for inspection at the Company's registered
office and AGM. Details of non-executive directors' fees are set out in on page 39.

Directors' contracts
Executive directors currently have employment contracts, which may be terminated by the Company with up to one year's notice. No
other payments are made for compensation for loss of office.
The Chairman and other non-executive directors currently have employment contracts which may be terminated by the Company with up
to one year's notice. No other payments are made for compensation for loss of office. 
Long term employee share awards
The Company has established an offshore Employee Benefit Trust (EBT ) and a UK Share Incentive Plan (SIP ). These plans were set
up in order to reward employees for the performance of the Company on a long term basis and to enable the Company to continue to
attract a high calibre of management and operational personnel. Any awards under the EBT and SIP are approved by the Remuneration
committee and members of the plans must continue in the Company's employment for at least one year in order for the shares to vest.
As of 12 July 2005 both plans held a combined total of 1,534,125 shares of the Company which have been purchased in the market.
Share option scheme
On occasion, the Remuneration committee considers whether a grant of options should be made under the share option schemes in place
for the Company, and if so, at what level. In arriving at a decision, the committee takes into consideration the personal performance of
each executive as well as remuneration practice for the Company's peer group. 
The share options held by the executive directors are:

J G Henry exercised 120,000 options at a market price of 98p per share resulting in an unrealised gain of approximately  87,600. He
subsequently sold 50,000 shares at 95p and continues to hold 70,000 of the shares issued following the exercise of the options.
The options are exercisable between three and 7 years of being issued, subject to performance conditions requiring growth in the
Company's net assets per share, and returns to shareholders by way of share price increase and dividends being in excess of at least half
of the companies in the FTSE Gold Mines Index. The scheme, as amended and approved at the 2004 AGM, does not permit the issue of
more than 10 per cent of the Company's share capital by way of these options when taken together with all shares allocated under all
other share incentive schemes that may be in place at the time. The current scheme also limits awards to individuals with a combined
market value, based on the market price at the date of grant, of up to twice an individual's salary per year with a limit of 8 times salary
over the previous 10 year period.

All awards to the directors form part of the deferred share bonus payments included in their remuneration packages. All awards are made
at the recommendation of the Remuneration committee to the trustees of the EBT as the Company does not operate a defined bonus
plan. For the financial year under review the Remuneration committee recommended the allocation of EBT shares as deferred share bonus
payments to be issued over a three year period to J T Catchpole 98,478 shares and J G Henry 74,109 shares. These shares will be issued
from the EBT in approximate equal annual instalments between one and three year periods.
The Board reviewed the performance of the non-executive directors and recommended to the trustees the following allocation of EBT
shares as deferred salary consideration to be issued after a three year period: N M Scott 33,452 shares, Sir R Brooke Bt. 12,866 shares,
J F Newman 10,293 shares, and R A Pilkington 10,293 shares.
