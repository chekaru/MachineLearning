The 2005 Remuneration Report was
approved by shareholders at the
September 2005 AGM.
The Remuneration committee is chaired by
N G McNair Scott. Its other members
are Sir Richard Brooke Bt., J U Rydell,
J F Newman and R A Pilkington.
All members of the committee are
independent non-executive directors. The
committee determines an overall
remuneration package for executive
directors in order to attract and retain high
quality executives.
None of the committee has any personal
financial interest in the matters to be
decided, other than as shareholders,
potential conflicts of interest arising from
cross-directorships, nor any day-to-day
involvement in running the business. The
committee consults the Chief Executive
about its proposals and has access to
professional advice from inside and
outside the Company.
Executive directors'
remuneration
Policy on executive directors'
remuneration
The Company operates within a competitive
environment and its performance depends
on the individual contributions of the
directors and employees.
Executive remuneration packages are
designed to attract, motivate and retain
directors of the calibre necessary to
manage the Group's operations and to
reward them for enhancing shareholder
value. The performance measurement
of the executive directors and the
determination of their annual remuneration
package are undertaken by the committee.
The executive directors' remuneration
packages may include:
(i) basic annual salary
(ii) benefits
(iii) pension contributions
(iv) annual cash and share bonus
payments
(v) share options
(vi) long-term share incentives.
Each executive director's basic salary and
pension contributions are reviewed
annually by the committee. In deciding
upon appropriate levels of remuneration
the committee has regard to rates of pay
for similar jobs in comparable companies
as well as internal factors such as
performance. Executive directors' basic
salaries were last reviewed with effect
from 11 July 2006. 
The committee establishes the objectives
which must be met for a cash and deferred
share bonus to be paid. The committee
believes that the award of any annual
bonuses should be tied to the interests of
the Company's shareholders and that the
principal measure of those interests is
shareholder value. 
The executive directors may participate in
share incentive schemes recommended
by the Remuneration committee for the
Group's key employees. 
Non-executive directors'
remuneration
Chairman's fees and letter of
appointment
It is the Company's policy that the Chairman
should be remunerated on a competitive
basis and at a level which reflects his
contribution to the Group, as assessed by
the Board. He does not participate in the
Group's pension arrangements and a formal
letter of appointment setting out his duties
and responsibilities is available for
inspection at the Company's registered
office and AGM. Details of his fees can be
found on page 43.
Non-executive directors' fees and
letters of appointment
The Board as a whole, with the benefit of
independent professional advice, deter-
mines non-executive directors' fees,
although non-executive directors do not
vote on any increases of their own fees.
Fees are set to reflect the responsibilities
and time spent by the directors on the
affairs of the Company. They do not
participate in the Group's pension
arrangements. Non-executive directors
have a formal letter of appointment setting
out their duties and responsibilities which
are available for inspection at the
Company's registered office and AGM.
Details of non-executive directors' fees are
set out on page 43.
Directors' contracts
Executive directors currently have
employment contracts, which may be
terminated by the Company with up to one
year's notice. No other payments are made
for compensation for loss of office unless
otherwise agreed by the Remuneration
committee.
The Chairman and other non-executive
directors currently have employment
contracts which may be terminated
by the Company with up to one year's
notice. No other payments are made for
compensation for loss of office. 
Long term employee
share awards
The Company has established an offshore
Employee Benefit Trust (EBT ) and a UK
Share Incentive Plan (SIP ). These plans
were set up in order to reward employees
for the performance of the Company on a
long term basis and to enable the
Company to continue to attract a high
calibre of management and operational
personnel. Any awards under the EBT and
SIP are approved by the Remuneration
committee and members of the plans
must continue in the Company's
employment for at least one year in order
for the shares to vest. As of 12 July 2006
both plans held a combined total of
1,078,681 shares of the Company which
have been purchased in the market.

On occasion, the Remuneration committee considers whether a grant of options should be made under the share option schemes in place
for the Company, and if so, at what level. In arriving at a decision, the committee takes into consideration the personal performance of
each executive as well as remuneration practice for the Company's peer group.
