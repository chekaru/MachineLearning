 49 Avocet Mining PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2007
The 2006 Remuneration Report was approved by shareholders at the September 2006 AGM.
The Remuneration committee is chaired by N G McNair Scott. Its other members are Sir Richard Brooke Bt., J F Newman and 
R A Pilkington. All members of the committee are independent non-executive directors. The committee determines an overall
remuneration package for executive directors in order to attract and retain high quality executives.
None of the committee has any personal financial interest in the matters to be decided, other than as shareholders, potential conflicts
of interest arising from cross-directorships, nor any day to day involvement in running the business. The committee consults the
Chief Executive Officer about its proposals and has access to professional advice from inside and outside the Company.
Executive directors' remuneration
Policy on executive directors' remuneration
The Company operates within a competitive environment and its performance depends on the individual contributions of the directors
and employees.
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the calibre necessary to manage the Group's
operations and to reward them for enhancing shareholder value. The performance measurement of the executive directors and the
determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the committee.
The executive directors' remuneration packages may include:
(i) basic annual salary
(ii) benefits
(iii) pension contributions
(iv) annual cash and share bonus payments
(v) share options
(vi) long term share incentives.
Each executive director's basic salary and pension contributions are reviewed annually by the committee. In deciding upon
appropriate levels of remuneration the committee has regard to rates of pay for similar jobs in comparable companies as well 
as internal factors such as performance. Executive directors' basic salaries were last reviewed with effect from 1 July 2007 
and no changes were made. 
The committee establishes the objectives which must be met for a cash and deferred share bonus to be paid. The committee
believes that the award of any annual bonuses should be tied to the interests of the Company's shareholders and that the principal
measure of those interests is shareholder value. 
The executive directors may participate in share incentive schemes recommended by the Remuneration committee for the Group's
key employees. 
Share bonus plan
In order to ensure the Company continues to be able to attract and retain high calibre senior management, in July 2006 the
Remuneration committee approved a share bonus plan for executive directors and senior management not on the board. 
The plan operates as follows:
  of the total bonus award 50 per cent is at the discretion of the Remuneration committee, with the remaining 50 per cent 
determined by the Company's share price performance measured against that of the companies included in the 
FTSE Gold Mines Index (the Index Constituents);
  as shown in the table below, the non-discretionary share awards are made on a sliding scale whereby higher awards are made
when the Company's shares perform above or within the higher quartiles. Should the shares perform in the lower half of the
index, awards are at the discretion of the Remuneration committee;

Share bonus plan (continued)
Performance vs Index Constituents Share award value as percentage of salary
(1)
Exceeds all Index Constituents up to 200%
Within quartiles:
- first (top) up to 150%
- second up to 100%
- third and fourth awards at discretion of the Remuneration committee
(1) Based on individual criteria for each employee
  bonuses are ordinarily paid in shares, although the Remuneration committee may elect to pay up to 50 per cent of the value of
any award to an individual in cash;
  half of any share awards will be restricted for sale for a period of 12 months should the employee remain in the Company's
employment for this period of restriction; and 
  the scheme is reviewed by the board on an annual basis. Participation in the plan is at the discretion of the board and currently
comprises the two executive directors as well as the Chief Operating Officer and the Chief Geologist.
Non-executive directors' remuneration
Chairman's fees and letter of appointment
It is the Company's policy that the Chairman should be remunerated on a competitive basis and at a level which reflects his
contribution to the Group, as assessed by the board. He does not participate in the Group's pension arrangements and a formal letter
of appointment setting out his duties and responsibilities is available for inspection at the Company's registered office and AGM.
Details of his fees can be found on page 52.
Non-executive directors' fees and letters of appointment
The board as a whole, with the benefit of independent professional advice, determines non-executive directors' fees, although non-
executive directors do not vote on any increases of their own fees. Fees are set to reflect the responsibilities and time spent by the
directors on the affairs of the Company. They do not participate in the Group's pension arrangements. Non-executive directors have
a formal letter of appointment setting out their duties and responsibilities which are available for inspection at the Company's
registered office and AGM. Details of non-executive directors' fees are set out on page 52.
Directors' contracts
Executive directors currently have employment contracts, which may be terminated by the Company with up to one year's notice.
No other payments are made for compensation for loss of office unless otherwise agreed by the Remuneration committee.
The Chairman and other non-executive directors currently have employment contracts which may be terminated by the Company
with up to one year's notice. No other payments are made for compensation for loss of office.
Long term employee share awards
The Company has established an offshore Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) and a UK Share Incentive Plan (SIP). These plans were 
set up in order to reward employees for the performance of the Company on a long term basis and to enable the Company to
continue to attract a high calibre of management and operational personnel. Any awards under the EBT and SIP are approved by 
the Remuneration committee and members of the plans must continue in the Company's employment for at least one year in 
order for the shares to vest. As of 10 July 2007 both plans held a combined total of 1,591,209 shares of the Company which 
have been purchased in the market.
Share option scheme
On occasion, the Remuneration committee considers whether a grant of options should be made under the share option schemes
in place for the Company, and if so, at what level. In arriving at a decision, the committee takes into consideration the personal
performance of each executive as well as remuneration practice for the Company's peer group.
