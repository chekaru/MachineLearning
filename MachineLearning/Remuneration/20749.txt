REPORT ON DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
The 2007 Remuneration Report was approved by shareholders
at the September 2007 AGM. 
The Remuneration committee is chaired by N G McNair Scott.
Its other members are Sir Richard Brooke Bt., J F Newman and
R A Pilkington. All members of the committee are independent
non-executive directors. The committee determines an overall
remuneration package for executive directors in order to attract
and retain high quality executives.
None of the committee has any personal financial interest in the
matters to be decided, other than as shareholders or potential
conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships, nor any day
to day involvement in running the business. The committee
consults the Chief Executive Officer about its proposals and has
access to professional advice from inside and outside the
Company.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
POLICY ON EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
The Company operates within a competitive environment and
its performance depends on the individual contributions of the
directors and employees.
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract,
motivate and retain directors of the calibre necessary to manage
the Group's operations and to reward them for enhancing
shareholder value. The performance measurement of the
executive directors and the determination of their annual
remuneration package are undertaken by the committee.
The executive directors' remuneration packages may include:
(i) basic annual salary
(ii) benefits
(iii) pension contributions
(iv) annual cash and share bonus payments
(v) share options
(vi) long term share incentives.
Each executive director's basic salary and pension contributions
are reviewed annually by the committee. In deciding upon
appropriate levels of remuneration the committee has regard to
rates of pay for similar jobs in comparable companies as well as
internal factors such as performance. Executive directors' basic
salaries were last reviewed with effect from 1 July 2008 with
appropriate changes made in order to continue to attract the
highest calibre management possible. 
The committee establishes the objectives which must be met
for a cash and deferred share bonus to be paid. The committee
believes that the award of any annual bonuses should be tied to
the interests of the Company's shareholders and that the
principal measure of those interests is shareholder value. 
The executive directors may participate in share incentive
schemes recommended by the Remuneration committee for
the Group's key employees.
SHARE BONUS PLAN
In order to ensure the Company continues to be able to attract
and retain high calibre senior management, in July 2006 the
Remuneration committee approved a share bonus plan for
executive directors and senior management not on the board.
The plan operates as follows:
  of the total bonus award, 50 per cent is at the discretion
of the Remuneration committee, with the remaining 50
per cent determined by the Company's share price
performance measured against that of the companies
included in the FTSE Gold Mines Index (the Index
Constituents);
  as shown in the table below, the non-discretionary share
awards are made on a sliding scale whereby higher
awards are made when the Company's shares perform
above or within the higher quartiles. Should the shares
perform in the lower half of the index, awards are at the
discretion of the Remuneration committee;
Performance vs Index Share award value as
Constituents percentage of salary
(1)
Exceeds all Index Constituents up to 200%
Within quartiles:
First (top) up to 150%
Second up to 100%
Third and fourth awards at discretion
of the Remuneration
committee
(1)  Based on individual criteria for each employee
  bonuses are ordinarily paid in shares, although the
Remuneration committee may elect to pay up to 50 per
cent of the value of any award to an individual in cash;
  half of any share awards will be restricted for sale for a
period of 12 months should the employee remain in the
Company's employment for this period of restriction; 
  the scheme is reviewed by the board on an annual basis.
Participation in the plan is at the discretion of the board
and currently comprises the two executive directors as
well as the Chief Operating Officer and the Chief
Geologist.
The Company's share performance in the year just ended placed
it in the second quartile.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS'
REMUNERATION
CHAIRMAN'S FEES AND LETTER OF APPOINTMENT
It is the Company's policy that the Chairman should be
remunerated on a competitive basis and at a level which reflects
his contribution to the Group, as assessed by the board. He does
not participate in the Group's pension arrangements and a formal
letter of appointment setting out his duties and responsibilities is
available for inspection at the Company's registered office and
AGM. Details of his fees can be found on page 52.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' FEES AND LETTERS OF
APPOINTMENT
The board as a whole, with the benefit of independent
professional advice, determines non-executive directors' fees,
although non-executive directors do not vote on any increases
of their own fees. Fees are set to reflect the responsibilities and
time spent by the directors on the affairs of the Company. They
do not participate in the Group's pension arrangements. Non-
executive directors have a formal letter of appointment setting
out their duties and responsibilities which are available for
inspection at the Company's registered office and AGM. Details
of non-executive directors' fees are set out on page 52.
DIRECTORS' CONTRACTS
Executive directors currently have employment contracts, which
may be terminated by the Company with up to one year's notice.
No other payments are made for compensation for loss of office
unless otherwise agreed by the Remuneration committee.
The Chairman and other non-executive directors currently have
employment contracts which may be terminated by the
Company with up to one year's notice. No other payments are
made for compensation for loss of office. 
LONG TERM EMPLOYEE SHARE AWARDS
The Company has established an offshore Employee Benefit
Trust (EBT) and a UK Share Incentive Plan (SIP). These plans
were set up in order to reward employees for the performance
of the Company on a long term basis and to enable the
Company to continue to attract a high calibre of management
and operational personnel. Any awards under the EBT and SIP
are approved by the Remuneration committee and members of
the plans must continue in the Company's employment for at
least one year in order for the shares to vest. At 8 July 2008 both
plans held a combined total of 1,339,799 shares of the Company
which have been purchased in the market.
SHARE OPTION SCHEME
On occasion, the Remuneration committee considers whether a
grant of options should be made under the share option
schemes in place for the Company, and if so, at what level. In
arriving at a decision, the committee takes into consideration the
personal performance of each executive as well as
remuneration practice for the Company's peer group.
