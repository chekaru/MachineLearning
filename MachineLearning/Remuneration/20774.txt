 53 Avocet Mining PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009
The 2008 Remuneration Report was approved by shareholders at the September 2008 AGM.
The Remuneration committee is chaired by N G McNair Scott. Its other members are Sir Richard Brooke Bt. J F Newman, R A Pilkington,
R S Robertson and M J Donoghue. All members of the committee are independent non-executive directors. The committee determines an overall
remuneration package for executive directors in order to attract and retain high quality executives.
None of the committee has any personal financial interest in the matters to be decided, other than as shareholders, nor any day to day involvement
in running the business. All directors are required to submit to the board on an annual basis a declaration of their interests, and to seek approval from
the board whenever these interests change that such changes do not cause a conflict in the interests of the individual in his capacity as a member
of the board.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
POLICY ON EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
The Company operates within a competitive environment and its performance depends on the individual contributions of the directors and employees.
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the calibre necessary to manage the Group's operations
and to reward them for enhancing shareholder value. The performance measurement of the executive directors and the determination of their
annual remuneration package are undertaken by the committee.
The executive directors' remuneration packages may include:
(i) basic annual salary; (iv) annual cash and share bonus payments;
(ii) benefits; (v) share options; and
(iii) pension contributions; (vi) long term share incentives.
Each executive director's basic salary and pension contributions are reviewed annually by the committee. In deciding upon appropriate levels of
remuneration the committee has regard to rates of pay for similar jobs in comparable companies as well as internal factors such as performance.
Executive directors' basic salaries were last reviewed with effect from 1 July 2009 at which time no changes to basic salaries were made.
The committee establishes the objectives which must be met for a cash and deferred share bonus to be paid. The committee believes that the
award of any annual bonuses should be tied to the interests of the Company's shareholders and that the principal measure of those interests is
shareholder value.
The executive directors may participate in share incentive schemes recommended by the Remuneration committee for the Group's key employees.
SHARE BONUS PLAN
In order to ensure the Company continues to be able to attract and retain high calibre senior management, in July 2006 the Remuneration committee
approved a share bonus plan for executive directors and senior management not on the board. The plan operates as follows:
  of the total bonus award, 50 per cent is at the discretion of the Remuneration committee, with the remaining 50 per cent determined by the
Company's share price performance measured against that of the companies included in the FTSE Gold Mines Index (the Index Constituents);
  as shown in the table below, the non-discretionary share awards are made on a sliding scale whereby higher awards are made when the
Company's shares perform above or within the higher quartiles. Should the shares perform in the lower half of the index, awards are at the
discretion of the Remuneration committee;
Performance vs Index Constituents Share award value as percentage of salary
(1)
Exceeds all Index Constituents up to 200%
Within quartiles: First (top) up to 150%
Second up to 100%
Third and fourth awards at discretion of the Remuneration committee
(1) Based on individual criteria for each employee
  bonuses are ordinarily paid in shares, although the Remuneration committee may elect to pay up to 50 per cent of the value of any award to
an individual in cash;
  half of any share awards will be restricted for sale for a period of 12 months should the employee remain in the Company's employment for
this period of restriction; and
  the scheme is reviewed by the board on an annual basis. Participation in the plan is at the discretion of the board and during the year
comprised the two executive directors as well as E Vesel and P A Flindell.
The Company's share performance in the year just ended placed it in the fourth quartile.

CHAIRMAN'S FEES AND LETTER OF APPOINTMENT
It is the Company's policy that the Chairman should be remunerated on a competitive basis and at a level which reflects his contribution to the Group,

responsibilities is available for inspection at the Company's registered office and AGM. Details of his fees can be found on page 56.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' FEES AND LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT
The board as a whole, with the benefit of independent professional advice, determines non-executive directors' fees, although non-executive

the Company. They do not participate in the Group's pension arrangements. Non-executive directors have a formal letter of appointment setting

year's notice. No other payments are made for compensation for loss of office.
LONG TERM EMPLOYEE SHARE AWARDS
The Company has established an offshore Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) and a UK Share Incentive Plan (SIP). These plans were set up in order to
reward employees for the performance of the Company on a long term basis and to enable the Company to continue to attract a high calibre of
management and operational personnel. Any awards under the EBT and SIP are approved by the Remuneration committee and members of the
plans must continue in the Company's employment for at least one year in order for the shares to vest. At 23 June 2009 the EBT and SIP held a
combined total of 1,064,146 shares of the Company.
SHARE OPTION SCHEME
On occasion, the Remuneration committee considers whether a grant of options should be made under the share option schemes in place for the
Company, and if so, at what level. In arriving at a decision, the committee takes into consideration the personal performance of each executive as
well as remuneration practice for the Company's peer group.
The share options held by the executive directors during the year were as follows:
