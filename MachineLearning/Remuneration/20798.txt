REMUNERATION REPORT
This report is presented to shareholders by the board and provides information on Directors' remuneration. A resolution will be put to shareholders
at the Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2011, inviting them to consider and approve this report. 
PERFORMANCE
  
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The committee is governed by terms of reference agreed by the board. It determines the overall direction of remuneration policy as well as the
specific remuneration packages, including share schemes, of the executive directors and also monitors the remuneration of other senior employees.
The committee is chaired by R P Edey and was previously chaired by N G McNair Scott until his retirement in September 2010. UK Corporate
Governance Code states that the Company chairman may be a member of, but not chair, the Remuneration committee. However, the Company
believes R P Edey to be the most appropriate independent non-executive director to occupy the role of chairman of the Remuneration committee,
by virtue of his experience and judgement. It is not considered that there exists any conflict of interest arising as a result of this. 
The other members of the committee are R A Pilkington, H Arnet and M J Donoghue, who served throughout the year, and B J W Rourke who joined
the committee in July 2010. All members of the committee are independent non-executive directors, with the exception of H Arnet whose position
as Chief Executive Office of Datum AS, a major shareholder, makes him a non-independent non-executive director.
The Chief Executive attends meetings at the invitation of the committee to provide guidance as appropriate on the impact of remuneration decisions
and on the performance of senior executives; he does not attend when his own remuneration is discussed. During the course of the year, the
committee was advised by Kepler Associates. Kepler Associates does not provide any other services to the Company.
None of the committee has any personal financial interest in the matters to be decided, other than as shareholders, nor any day to day involvement
in running the business. All directors are required to submit to the board on an annual basis a declaration of their interests, and to seek approval from
the board, whenever these interests change, that such changes do not cause a conflict in the interests of the individual in his capacity as a member
of the board. 
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Company operates within a competitive environment and its performance depends on the individual contributions of the executive directors and
other employees. Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain executive directors of the calibre necessary to
manage the Company's operations and to reward them for enhancing shareholder value. The performance of the executive directors is assessed
by the committee and taken in to account when determining their remuneration.
Hitherto, in common with many companies at a similar stage of development, Avocet has operated a highly flexible approach to executive
remuneration. Executives have been made largely discretionary awards under a number of plans including cash bonuses, a Share Bonus Plan, share
options and a SIP (details of all of which are set out below). During the course of 2010, the committee undertook a review of the Company's
remuneration arrangements including all aspects of remuneration for executive directors and senior executives, and share-based remuneration
throughout the Company. This review sought to determine whether the Company's remuneration arrangements remained appropriate, particularly
given its recent growth and development, and with reference to market practice within its sector; and whether a more structured approach to
remuneration, particularly incentives, might now be appropriate.
5 YEAR CUMULATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (TSR) 55 Avocet Mining PLC  Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010
As a result of this review the committee is proposing to adopt a revised approach to remuneration from 2011 onwards. Total remuneration for the
executive directors and other senior executives will consist of five main elements, as follows:
Performance Performance

Base Salary Reflects competitive Not applicable Normally reviewed annually

Accordingly, the committee is proposing to seek shareholders' approval for the adoption of the two long-term incentive schemes summarised
above, namely the Performance Share Plan and the Share Option Plan. These proposals are set out in detail in a circular to shareholders for review
and approval at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2011. The committee believes that these proposals, which have the support of
the whole board, are an important step in ensuring that the Company continues to offer remuneration arrangements which motivate and retain the
executives who are critical to the success of the Company, and to align their interests with those of shareholders.

REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED)
COMPONENTS OF REMUNERATION
The elements that comprised the remuneration package for executive directors during 2010 are set out below.
SALARY AND BENEFITS
Executive directors' basic salaries are reviewed annually by the committee, and no increases were proposed for 2011. Current salaries for the
executive directors are: B A Richards,  300,000; A M Norris  250,000.
Provision of benefits including pension contributions is kept under review by the committee.
SHORT-TERM INCENTIVES
During 2010, the Company operated a Share Bonus Plan for executive directors and other selected senior executives. The plan was approved by
the board in July 2006 and has been operated annually since. The committee intends that 2010 will be the last year of its operation and the revised
arrangements set out above will replace it from 2011 onwards.
The plan provided for awards linked to the Company's share price performance relative to the FTSE Gold Mines Index. Participation in the 2010 cycle
included the two executive directors, B A Richards (target awards of 100% of salary) and A M Norris (target award of 75% of salary); and two other
members of the executive committee, P A Flindell and H-A L'Orange (target awards of 50% of salary).
Notional awards of shares based on target award percentages were made at the start of the plan cycle and vested on the following basis:
Performance vs Index Constituents Share award value as percentage of target opportunity
Exceeds all Index Constituents up to 200%
Within quartiles: First (top) up to 150%
Second up to 100%
Third and fourth  (i.e. below median) awards at discretion of the Remuneration committee
To the extent that vesting occurred, awards were ordinarily released in the form of shares restricted for 12 months, although the Remuneration
committee could elect to pay up to half the value of the award in cash.
In 2010, the board determined that the plan should run for a nine-month period from 1 April 2010 to 31 December 2010 in order to bring the plan
cycle into alignment with the Company's reporting years, the previous cycle having ended on 31 March 2010.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
The Company operated a Share Option Plan, which was first approved by the board in 1999, under which awards are made to selected employees
including executive directors. Awards made under this plan to executive directors during 2010 are set out on page 59. It is intended that this plan
will be replaced by the two new long-term incentives plans set out above which will operate from 2011. 57 Avocet Mining PLC  Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010  
SERVICE CONTRACTS - EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Executive directors currently have employment contracts which may be terminated by the Company with one year's notice. No other payments are
made for compensation for loss of office unless otherwise agreed by the Remuneration committee.
SERVICE CONTRACTS - CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Chairman and other non-executive directors have employment contracts which may be terminated by the Company with up to one year's
notice. No other payments are made for compensation for loss of office.
CHAIRMAN'S FEES AND LETTER OF APPOINTMENT
It is the Company's policy that the Chairman should be remunerated on a competitive basis and at a level which reflects his contribution to the Group,
as assessed by the board. A formal letter of appointment setting out his duties and responsibilities is available for inspection at the Company's
registered office and AGM. Details of his fees can be found below.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' FEES AND LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT
The board as a whole, with the benefit of independent professional advice, determines non-executive directors' fees, although non-executive
directors do not vote on any increases of their own fees. Fees are set to reflect the responsibilities and time spent by the directors on the affairs of
the Company. Non-executive directors have a formal letter of appointment setting out their duties and responsibilities which is available for inspection
at the Company's registered office and AGM. Details of non-executive directors' fees are set out below.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS - EBT AND SIP
The Company has established an offshore Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) and a UK Share Incentive Plan (SIP). 
The EBT, which is administered by independent trustees, is funded by Avocet and holds shares that may be used, on the recommendation of the
Remuneration committee and at the discretion of the trustees, exclusively for the settlement of employee share awards. Shares awarded in this
manner may include awards made under the Share Bonus Plan, settlement of share options exercised in the year, or discretionary share bonuses.
Restricted shares may be held in the EBT prior to release. 
The SIP is a plan that allows UK tax residents to benefit from share awards under favourable taxation terms, subject to restrictions. Any awards made
under this plan must be made under terms consistent with UK taxation requirements. 
During the year ended 31 December 2010, the following restricted share awards and releases were made under the EBT.

SHARE BONUS PLAN
The change in accounting year end from 31 March to 31 December took place as of 31 December 2009, however the period over which all annual
remuneration awards were assessed continued until 31 March 2010. The assessment period was then amended to a nine month period ending 
  31 December 2010, to align with the accounting and calendar year ends. As a result, the accounting year ended 31 December 2010 included two
bonus period ends, while the nine months ending 31 December 2009 did not include an annual remuneration period end, and no awards were
made during this period. 
The performance of Avocet's share price was in the top quartile of the FTSE Gold Mining index over the 12 months ended 31 March 2010, while
over the nine months ended 31 December 2010, the share price performance exceeded all other constituents. As a result of this strong performance
in both periods of assessment, bonuses were payable to executive directors for both those periods, while no bonus was paid in respect of the 12
months ended 31 March 2009, as follows:

Share bonuses awarded in respect of the 12 months ended 31 March 2010 were announced on 1 April 2010 and were made in shares. Bonuses in
respect of the nine months ended 31 December 2010 will be made shortly following the release of year end results on 22 February 2011. The
Remuneration committee elected to pay 50 per cent of these awards in cash. 
SHARE OPTION SCHEME
The Company issued shares options under its Share Option Scheme until 2010. The options which remain under this scheme are exercisable
between three and seven years of being issued, subject to a performance condition requiring growth in the Company's net assets per share, and
returns to shareholders, through share price increase and dividends, to be in excess of at least half of the companies in the FTSE Gold Mines Index. 
The share options held by the executive directors during the year were as follows:
