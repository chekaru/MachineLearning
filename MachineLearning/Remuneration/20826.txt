Annual Report and Accounts 2011
50
This report is presented to shareholders by the Board and provides information on Directors' remuneration for the year ended 31 
December 2011. A resolution will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 3 May 2012, inviting them to consider and 
approve this report. This report complies with the requirements of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) regulations 2008 and the UK Corporate Governance Code.
PERFORMANCE
The chart shows Avocet's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) compared with the FTSE All Share Index and FTSE Gold Mines Index over the 
five year period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2011. The FTSE Gold Mines Index has been chosen as it comprises companies 
who are operating in the same sector as Avocet and are exposed to broadly similar risks and opportunities. In addition, the FTSE All 
Share Index has been chosen as an appropriate general index of UK equities.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Avocet's remuneration policies, as well as specific awards for Directors and senior managers, are determined by the Remuneration 
Committee. Details of this Committee's purpose, composition, operation and responsibilities are set out on page 44.
The Chief Executive Officer attends meetings at the invitation of the Committee to provide guidance as appropriate on the impact of 
remuneration decisions and on the performance of senior executives; he does not attend when his own remuneration is discussed. The 
Company Secretary also attends. During the course of the year, the Committee was advised by Kepler Associates. Kepler Associates do 
not provide any other services or advice to the Company.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the matters to be decided, other than as shareholders, or any day to day 
involvement in running the business. All Directors are required to submit to the Board on an annual basis a declaration of their interests, 
and to seek approval from the Board, whenever these interests change, to ensure that such changes do not cause a conflict in the 
interests of the individual in his capacity as a member of the Board.

REMUNERATION POLICY
The Company operates within a competitive environment and its performance depends on the individual contributions of the Directors 
and employees. Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain executives of the calibre necessary to 
manage the Company's operations and to reward them for enhancing shareholder value. The performance of the Executive Directors is 
assessed by the Committee and taken into account when determining their remuneration.
In common with many companies at a similar stage of development, Avocet has a competitive approach to executive remuneration.  
The total remuneration for the Executive Directors and other senior executives consists of five main elements, as follows:
Element Objective Performance period Performance conditions
Base Salary Reflects competitive market, level, role and 
individual contribution
Not applicable Normally reviewed annually taking into 
account pay for similar positions in similar 
companies, individual performance and the 
Company's overall approach to pay
Benefits 
(including pension 
contributions)
Reflects competitive market Not applicable Not applicable
Annual incentive 
(including deferral)
Motivates achievement of annual financial, 
operating and strategic goals, as well as 
individual performance goals
One year Subject to achievement of targets against 
key performance indicators including 
EBITDA, gold production, reserves and 
resources and specific strategic milestones, 
as well as personal performance
Performance Share 
Plan
Drives long-term value creation and aligns 
executives' and shareholders' interests. 
Three years Subject to relative position of the 
Company's TSR versus a basket of 
comparable gold-mining companies
Share Option Plan Options provide a more straightforward 
means of alignment that is appropriate also 
for use below the senior executive level.
Three years Subject to the Remuneration Committee's 
satisfaction that underlying financial 
performance is at a sufficient level such that 
vesting is appropriate
During the year, the Committee proposed no change to the incentive schemes summarised above, that were reviewed and approved in 
the Company's last Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2011, and believes that the Company continues to offer remuneration 
arrangements which motivate and retain the executives who are critical to the success of the Company, and to align their interests with 
those of shareholders.
The chart below illustrates the mix between fixed and variable remuneration for the two Executive Directors for on-target performance. 
Target performance assumes target annual incentive and a fair value for long-term incentive awards.

COMPONENTS OF REMUNERATION
The elements that comprised the remuneration package for the Executive Directors during 2011 are set out below.
Salary and benefits
Executive Directors' basic salaries are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee. In setting salaries the Committee considers 
pay levels and practices at Avocet's principal competitors as well as FTSE-listed companies of a similar size. The Committee also takes 
into account pay and conditions across the Group when setting base salaries for the Executive Directors. No increases are proposed for 
2012. During 2011, the base salary levels were  300,000 for BA Richards, and  250,000 for AM Norris. 
Benefits (including pension contributions)
The Company offers medical cover to all its key employees, as well as additional benefits (such as gym membership).
In addition, in 2011, the Remuneration Committee approved a Defined Contribution Pension Scheme to be implemented in 2012,  
with a minimum employer pension contribution for UK employees (including Executive Directors) of 3% of base salary, together with an 
opportunity for employees to contribute up to 6% of their salary, which would be matched by additional employer contributions giving a 
maximum total combined pension contribution of 15% of salary (with a maximum cost to the Company of 9% of the UK base salary cost).
Annual Incentive
The Executive Directors may earn an annual incentive of 50% of salary for target, up to a maximum of 75% of salary. Awards of up to 
62.5% of salary are determined with reference to a scorecard of stretching corporate objectives aligned to the Company's business 
strategy. For 2011, this included EBITDA, gold production, reserves and resources and specific strategic milestones. The outcome 
against the scorecard is then adjusted up or down by between 0 and 20% based on performance against personal/strategic objectives.
The Company operates bonus deferral for Executive Directors. Under this plan, 50% of any annual incentive award in excess of  30,000 
is mandatorily deferred into Avocet shares. These deferred shares may vest after a further one-year holding period, subject to continued 
employment. The remainder of any earned bonus is paid in cash after the year end.
Award opportunities to Executive Directors will remain unchanged for 2012 and the operation of the Annual Incentive will be broadly 
similar.
Long Term Incentive Plans
The long term incentive plans currently comprise:
(a) The Performance Share Plan (the PSP) 
Performance share awards, being conditional awards granted as shares or nil-cost options, are awarded to key executives (including 
Executive Directors). Performance share awards will not vest unless the Company's TSR performance over the three year performance 
period is at least at the median of a comparator group comprising companies operating in the same sector, whereby the award will vest 
as follows: 
TSR position of the Company relative to the comparator group Percentage of shares which vest
Below median 0%
At median 25%
Between median and upper quartile Between 25% and 100% on a straight-line basis
Upper quartile and above 100%
Awards are made to eligible employees including Executive Directors on a discretionary basis. 
The PSP was first introduced during the year, following approval by the Company's shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 5 May 
2011. It is the intention that awards be made annually, shortly after the release of the previous year's full year results, and that the 
performance periods be based on three calendar years. 
No awards were made during 2011, as the scheme was introduced part way through the year. Awards for the year ended December 2011 
will therefore be made shortly after the announcement of the Group's full year results, at the same time as the 2012 awards. The 
performance period for the 2011 awards will be 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2013, while the performance period for the 2012 awards 
will be 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2014. Under the rules of the PSP, shares do not vest for continuing employees under these 
schemes until three years after the grant of the awards, therefore any shares released under both of these awards will not be transferred 
to participants before February 2015.

(b) The Share Option Plan (the Option Plan) 
The Option Plan was also introduced in 2011. Options may be awarded to employees with an exercise price per share equal to the market 
value of a share at the time of grant. Options awards for the first cycle only will vest in three equal tranches over the three years from 
grant. The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that underlying performance has been sufficient for the options to vest. 
Subsequent grants of options will cliff vest after three years, subject to performance.
For 2011, BA Richards was awarded 184,838 options with an exercise price of 219.33p (an option award with a fair value of 75% of salary) 
and the FD was awarded 100,000 options with an exercise price of 219.33p (an option award with a fair value of 37.5% of salary). The 
aggregate of awards under this plan to any individual within a single financial year may not exceed 200% of salary except in exceptional 
circumstances, subject to Remuneration Committee approval.
SERVICE CONTRACTS - EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Executive Directors currently have employment contracts which may be terminated by the Company or employee with twelve months of 
notice. No other payments are made for compensation for loss of office.
LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT - CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Chairman and other Non-executive Directors each have a formal letter of appointment setting out their duties and responsibilities. 
These letters are available for inspection at the Company's registered office. 
Chairman's fees 
It is the Company's policy that the Chairman should be remunerated on a competitive basis and at a level which reflects his contribution 
to the Group, as assessed by the Board. Details of his fees can be found in the Total Remuneration of Directors below.
Non-executive Directors' fees
The Board as a whole, with the benefit of independent professional advice, determines Non-executive Directors' fees, although  
Non-executive Directors do not vote on any increases of their own fees. Fees are set to reflect the responsibilities and time spent by  
the Directors on the affairs of the Company. For 2011, the basic fee for Non-executive Directors was set at  40,000 with an additional 
 10,000 for the Chairman of the Audit Committee. Details of actual Non-executive Directors' fees received during the year can be  
found in the Total Remuneration of Directors Summary overleaf. Avocet Mining PLC

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUST (EBT) AND UK SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN (SIP)
The Company has established an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) and a UK Share Incentive Plan (SIP). 
The EBT, which is administered by independent trustees, is funded by Avocet and holds shares that may be used, on the 
recommendation of the Remuneration Committee and at the discretion of the trustees, exclusively for the settlement of employee share 
awards. Shares released in this manner may be for the settlement of awards made under the Share Bonus Plan, Performance Share 
Plan, Deferred Bonus Plan, or to satisfy the exercise of share options, as well as previous discretionary share bonus awards. Restricted 
shares may be held in the EBT prior to release. 
The SIP is a plan that allows UK tax residents to benefit from share awards under favourable taxation terms, subject to restrictions. Any 
awards made under this plan must be made under terms consistent with UK taxation requirements. 
During the year ended 31 December 2011, the following restricted share allocations and releases were made under the EBT:

SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
In 2011, the Company introduced a new scheme - the Share Option Plan. Prior to 2011, the Company awarded share options under an 
older scheme, originally introduced in 1999. All new awards are to be made under the newer scheme, however outstanding awards under 
the older scheme are still valid, and may be exercised at the appropriate time, providing the relevant performance conditions are satisfied 
(specifically the requirement for growth in the Company's net assets per share, and returns to shareholders, through share price increase 
and dividends, to be in excess of at least half of the companies in the FTSE Gold Mines Index). 
The share options held by the Executive Directors under either of these schemes during the year were as follows:

SHARE PRICE MOVEMENTS DURING 2011
The mid-market closing price of the Company's shares at 31 December 2011 was  1.85 (31 December 2010:  2.37). The highest and 
lowest trading prices of the Company's shares during the year were  2.87 and  1.78 respectively.
DILUTION
Taking account of all shares newly issued as a consequence of incentive schemes over the ten-year period to 31 December 2011 plus 
outstanding equity awards under all the Company's equity schemes, where new issue shares may be used to satisfy their exercise, 
potential dilution is less than 10% of the issued ordinary shares.
