5-Year Cumulative Shareholder Returns
Value of  100 invested on 31 December 2007
FTSE Gold Mines Index
FTSE All-Share Index
This report is presented to shareholders by the Board and provides information on Directors' remuneration for the year ended 31 December 
2012. A resolution will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 2 May 2013, inviting them to consider and approve this 
report. This report complies with the requirements of both the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
regulations 2008 and the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Performance
The chart shows Avocet's Total Shareholder Return ( TSR') compared with the FTSE All Share Index and FTSE Gold Mines Index over the 
five year period from 31 December 2007 to 31 December 2012. The FTSE Gold Mines Index has been chosen as it comprises companies 
who are operating in the same sector as Avocet and are exposed to broadly similar risks and opportunities. In addition, the FTSE All Share 
Index has been chosen as an appropriate general index of UK equities.
Remuneration Committee
Avocet's remuneration policies, as well as specific awards for Directors and senior managers, are determined by the Remuneration 
Committee. Details of this Committee's purpose, composition, operation and responsibilities are set out on page 42.
The Chief Executive Officer attends meetings at the invitation of the Committee to provide guidance as appropriate on the impact of 
remuneration decisions and on the performance of senior executives; he does not attend when his own remuneration is discussed. The 
Company Secretary also attends. During the course of the year, the Committee was advised by Kepler Associates. Kepler Associates do 
not provide any other services or advice to the Company.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the matters to be decided, other than as shareholders, or any day to day 
involvement in running the business. All Directors are required to submit to the Board on an annual basis a declaration of their interests, and 
to seek approval from the Board, whenever these interests change, to ensure that such changes do not cause a conflict in the interests of 
the individual in his capacity as a member of the Board.
Remuneration policy
The Company operates within a competitive environment and its performance depends on the individual contributions of the Directors and 
employees. Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain executives of the calibre necessary to manage 
the Company's operations and to reward them for enhancing shareholder value. The performance of the Executive Directors is assessed by 
the Committee and taken into account when determining their remuneration.
In common with many companies at a similar stage of development, Avocet has a competitive approach to executive remuneration.

o ve Rview Business Review d i RectoR s A nd g oveR n Ance Fin Anci AL s t Ate Ments The total remuneration for the Executive Directors and other senior executives consists of five main elements, as follows:

Three years Subject to relative position of the 
Company's TSR versus a basket of 
comparable gold-mining companies
Share Option Plan Options provide a more straightforward 
means of alignment that is appropriate also 
for use below the senior executive level
Three years Subject to the Remuneration Committee's 
satisfaction that underlying financial 
performance is at a sufficient level such 
that vesting is appropriate
During the year, the Committee proposed no change to the incentive schemes summarised above, that were reviewed and approved in the 
Company's last Annual General Meeting on 3 May 2012, and believes that the Company continues to offer remuneration arrangements 
which motivate and retain the executives who are critical to the success of the Company, and to align their interests with those of 
shareholders.
Components of remuneration
The elements that comprised the remuneration package for the Executive Directors during 2012 are set out below.
Salary and benefits
Executive Directors' basic salaries are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee. In setting salaries the Committee considers pay 
levels and practices at Avocet's principal competitors as well as FTSE-listed companies of a similar size. The Committee also takes into 
account pay and conditions across the Group when setting base salaries for the Executive Directors, to ensure the discrepancy between 
Executive Directors and other staff members is reasonable and commensurate with experience, skill levels, and responsibility. No increases 
are proposed for 2013. During 2012, the base salary levels were  300,000 for DC Cather and  250,000 for AM Norris.
Benefits (including pension contributions)
The Company offers medical cover to all its key employees; a Defined Contribution Pension Scheme (with a minimum employer pension 
contribution for UK employees including Executive Directors of 3% of base salary, together with an opportunity for employees to contribute 
up to 6% of their salary, which is matched by additional employer contributions giving a maximum total combined pension contribution of 
15% of salary), as well as additional benefits (such as gym membership).
Annual incentive
The Executive Directors may earn an annual incentive of 50% of salary for target, up to a maximum of 75% of salary. Awards of up to 62.5% 
of salary are determined with reference to a scorecard of stretching corporate objectives aligned to the Company's business strategy. For 
2012, this included EBITDA, gold production, reserves and resources and specific strategic milestones. The outcome against the scorecard 
is then adjusted up or down by between 0 and 20% based on performance against personal/strategic objectives.
The Company operates bonus deferral for Executive Directors. Under this plan, 50% of any annual incentive award in excess of  30,000 is 
mandatorily deferred into Avocet shares. These deferred shares may vest after a further one-year holding period, subject to continued 
employment. The remainder of any earned bonus is paid in cash after the year end.
Award opportunities to Executive Directors will remain unchanged for 2013 and the operation of the Annual Incentive will be broadly similar. 50
Avocet Mining PLc Annu AL Re Po Rt A nd Accounts 2012
Long-term incentive plans
The long-term incentive plans currently comprise:
(a) The Performance Share Plan ( the PSP')
Performance share awards, being conditional awards granted as shares or nil-cost options, are awarded to key executives (including 
Executive Directors). Performance share awards will not vest unless the Company's TSR performance over the three year performance 
period is at least at the median of a comparator group comprising companies operating in the same sector, whereby the award will vest as 
follows:
TSR position of the Company relative to the comparator group Percentage of shares which vest
Below median 0%
At median 25%
Between median and upper quartile Between 25% and 100% on a straight-line basis
Upper quartile and above 100%
Awards are made to eligible employees including Executive Directors on a discretionary basis.
The PSP was approved by the Company's shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2011. It is the intention that awards 
continue to be made annually, shortly after the release of the previous year's full year results, and that the performance periods be based on 
three calendar years. The aggregate of awards under this plan to any individual within a single financial year may not exceed 200% of salary 
except in exceptional circumstances, subject to Remuneration Committee approval.
No awards were made during 2011, as the scheme was introduced part way through the year. Awards for the year ended December 2011 
were made at the same time as the 2012 awards. The performance period for the 2011 awards is 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2013, 
while the performance period for the 2012 awards is 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2014. Under the rules of the PSP, shares do not vest 
for continuing employees under these schemes until three years after the grant of the awards, therefore any shares released under both of 
these awards will not be transferred to participants before February 2015.
(b) The Share Option Plan ( the Option Plan')
The Option Plan was also introduced in 2011. Options may be awarded to employees with an exercise price per share equal to the market 
value of a share at the time of grant. The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that underlying performance has been sufficient for the 
options to vest. Grants of options will vest in full after three years, subject to performance. The aggregate of awards under this plan to any 
individual within a single financial year may not exceed 200% of salary except in exceptional circumstances, subject to Remuneration 
Committee approval.
No awards were made during 2011, as the scheme was introduced part way through the year.
Service contracts - Executive Directors
Executive Directors currently have employment contracts which may be terminated by the Company with twelve months of notice, or by the 
employee with six months of notice. No other payments are made for compensation for loss of office.
Letters of appointment - Chairman and Non-executive Directors
The Chairman and other Non-executive Directors each have a formal letter of appointment setting out their duties and responsibilities. 
These letters are available for inspection at the Company's registered office.
Chairman's fees
It is the Company's policy that the Chairman should be remunerated on a competitive basis and at a level which reflects his contribution to 
the Group, as assessed by the Board. Details of his fees can be found in the Total Remuneration of Directors below.
Non-executive Directors' fees
The Board as a whole, with the benefit of independent professional advice, determines Non-executive Directors' fees, although Non-
executive Directors do not vote on any increases of their own fees. Fees are set to reflect the responsibilities and time spent by the Directors 
on the affairs of the Company. For 2012, the basic fee for Non-executive Directors was set at  40,000 with an additional  10,000 fee for the 
Chairs of the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee, and the Safety, Health & Environment Committee; and an additional  15,000 
fee for the Chairman of the Technical Committee. Details of actual Non-executive Directors' fees received during the year can be found in 
the Total Remuneration of Directors Summary overleaf.

Employee Benefit Trust and UK Share Incentive Plan
The Company has established an Employee Benefit Trust ( EBT') and a UK Share Incentive Plan ( SIP').
The EBT, which is administered by independent trustees, is funded by Avocet and holds shares that may be used, on the recommendation 
of the Remuneration Committee and at the discretion of the trustees, exclusively for the settlement of employee share awards. Shares 
released in this manner may be for the settlement of awards made under the Share Bonus Plan, Performance Share Plan, Deferred Bonus 
Plan, or to satisfy the exercise of share options, as well as previous discretionary share bonus awards. Restricted shares may be held in the 
EBT prior to release.
The SIP is a plan that allows UK tax residents to benefit from share awards under favourable taxation terms, subject to restrictions. Any 
awards made under this plan must be made under terms consistent with UK taxation requirements. 52

Share option schemes
In 2011, the Company introduced a new scheme - the Share Option Plan. Prior to 2011, the Company awarded share options under an 
older scheme, originally introduced in 1999. All new awards are to be made under the newer scheme, however outstanding awards under 
the older scheme are still valid, and may be exercised at the appropriate time, providing the relevant performance conditions are satisfied 
(specifically the requirement for growth in the Company's net assets per share, and returns to shareholders, through share price increase 
and dividends, to be in excess of at least half of the companies in the FTSE Gold Mines Index).

Share price movements during 2012
The mid-market closing price of the Company's shares at 31 December 2012 was  0.70 (31 December 2011:  1.85). The highest and lowest 
trading prices of the Company's shares during the year were  2.395 and  0.63 respectively.
Dilution
Taking account of all shares newly issued as a consequence of incentive schemes over the ten-year period to 31 December 2012 plus 
outstanding equity awards under all the Company's equity schemes, where new issue shares may be used to satisfy their exercise, potential 
dilution is less than 10% of the issued ordinary shares. 54
