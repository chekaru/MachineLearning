performance targets for the 2011 PSP award:
TSR position of the Company relative to the comparator group Percentage of shares which vest

the five year period from 31 December 2008 to 31 December 2013. The FTSE Gold Mines Index has been chosen as it comprises companies
who are operating in the same sector as Avocet and are exposed to broadly similar risks and opportunities. In addition, the FTSE All Share

It is anticipated that Directors will participate in Annual Incentive, PSP , and Share Option schemes in 2014, in line with previous years and
our proposed policy, however in view of the ongoing business review, the outcomes of which may materially impact the strategic objectives
for the year, no targets have been set at the current time.

Performance conditions outlined are as follows:
I. The share price change between the date of grant and the date of exercise must be higher than the change in the value of the FTSE Gold
Mining Index over the same period
II. Share price must have increased by at least 100% by 13 December 2015 in order for any Options to be exercisable, and by 125% in order
for the full amount to be exercisable. 
III. In order to be fully exercisable, the 30-day volume-weighted average price ( VWAP') for Avocet shares must exceed 80 pence in the
period between the Grant Date and the 26 March 2016. If the maximum 30-day VWAP during this service period is between 40 pence and
80 pence, the number of options which become exercisable will be a pro rata scale between 25% of the number of options awarded (for
40 pence) and 100% of the options awarded (for 80 pence). If the maximum 30-day VWAP during the service period does not reach 40
pence, no options will be exercisable.  
IV . These share options will become immediately exercisable, if the Avocet VWAP share price reaches 80 pence at any time between the
Grant Date and 31 December 2015. If the VWAP share price between Grant Date and 31 December 2015 reaches between 40 pence and
80 pence, the number of options which become exercisable at that time will be a pro rata scale between 25% of the number of options
awarded (for 40 pence) and 100% of the options awarded (for 80 pence). If the maximum 30-day VWAP between Grant Date and 31
December 2015 does not reach 40 pence, no options will be exercisable. Any of these options will lapse, if unexercised by 31 December
2015.
V . In order to be fully exercisable, the 30-day VWAP for Avocet shares must exceed 80 pence in the period between the Grant Date and the 
2 May 2016. If the maximum 30-day VWAP during this service period is between 40 pence and 80 pence, the number of options which
become exercisable will be a pro rata scale between 25% of the number of options awarded (for 40 pence) and 100% of the options
awarded (for 80 pence). If the maximum 30-day VWAP during this service period does not reach 40 pence, no options will be exercisable.
None of the other share options are subject to outstanding performance conditions, other than the discretion retained by the Remuneration
Committee to disallow the exercise of any options for any reason, for instance if it believes underlying business performance to be
insufficiently strong. 
There are no shareholding guidelines currently in place for any of the directors.

Employee Benefit T rust and UK Share Incentive Plan
The Company has established an Employee Benefit Trust ( EBT') and a UK Share Incentive Plan ( SIP'). 
The EBT, which is administered by independent trustees, is funded by Avocet and holds shares that may be used, on the recommendation of
the Remuneration Committee and at the discretion of the trustees, exclusively for the settlement of employee share awards. Shares released
in this manner may be for the settlement of awards made under the Share Bonus Plan, Performance Share Plan, Annual Incentive Plan, 
or to satisfy the exercise of share options, as well as previous discretionary share bonus awards. Restricted shares may be held in the EBT
prior to release. 
During the year ended 31 December 2013, the following restricted share allocations and releases were made under the EBT:

Share Option Schemes
In 2011, the Company introduced a new Share Option Plan. Prior to 2011, the Company awarded share options under an older scheme,
originally introduced in 1999. All new awards are made under the newer scheme, however some outstanding awards under the older scheme
are still outstanding, and may be exercised at the appropriate time, providing the relevant performance conditions are satisfied (specifically
the requirement for growth in the Company's net assets per share, and returns to shareholders, through share price increase and dividends,
to be in excess of at least half of the companies in the FTSE Gold Mines Index).  pg

outstanding equity awards under all the Company's equity schemes, where new issue shares may be used to satisfy their exercise, potential
dilution is less than 10% of the issued ordinary shares.
Interests of Directors and Persons Discharging Managerial Responsibility ( PDMRs')
In addition to the Board of Directors, the Company has deemed the following employees to be PDMRs (equivalent to Primary Insiders 
for the Oslo B rs):
Name Position
M Platts Head of Operations, West Africa
J Wynn Head of Finance and Company Secretary
R Simmons Head of Investor Relations and Business Development
The Remuneration Committee and its advisors
Avocet's remuneration policies, as well as specific awards for Directors and senior managers, are determined by the Remuneration
Committee. Details of this Committee's purpose, composition, operation and responsibilities are set out on pages 39 to 40.
The Chief Executive Officer attends meetings at the invitation of the Committee to provide guidance as appropriate on the impact of
remuneration decisions and on the performance of senior executives; he does not attend when his own remuneration is discussed. The
Company Secretary also attends. During the course of the year, the Committee was advised by Kepler Associates, who received total fees of
 10,125 in 2013 based on time and materials. Kepler were selected based on their experience and reputation in the industry, as well as their
knowledge of Avocet's business. Kepler Associates do not provide any other services or advice to the Company and the Committee
undertakes due diligence from time-to-time to satisfy itself that the advice it receives continues to be independent and objective.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the matters to be decided, other than as shareholders, or any day to day
involvement in running the business. All Directors are required to submit to the Board on an annual basis a declaration of their interests, and
to seek approval from the Board, whenever these interests change, to ensure that such changes do not cause a conflict in the interests of the
individual in his capacity as a member of the Board.

The 2.5% who voted against the report were not content with the payments to Executive Directors during 2012, which had been a period
where the Company's performance and share price had suffered, although it was explained that the majority of payments settled in 2012
were in relation to performance schemes which had been satisfied as a result of 2011 performance.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2013 pg  
We have audited the group financial statements of Avocet Mining PLC for year ended 31 December 2013 which comprise the consolidated
income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated
statement of changes in equity, the consolidated cash flow statement and notes to the financial statements 1 to 35. The financial reporting
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRSs') as adopted
by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other
than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors' Responsibilities Statement set out on page 36, the directors are responsible for the preparation of
the group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion
on the group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board's Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council's website at
www.frc.uk/apb/scope/private.cfm.
Auditor commentary
An overview of the scope of our audit
The group reports its operating results and financial position along three operating segments being UK, West Africa Mining Operations and
West Africa Exploration, as defined within the segmental reporting accounting policy in note 3. The group financial statements are a
consolidation of 5 reporting units comprising the group's operating businesses within these segments.
The overall approach to the group audit included the group audit team performing a full audit of the financial information of the UK head
office, in respect of the parent company and the group consolidation, and of the West Africa Mining Operations site in Burkina Faso.
Specified audit procedures were performed by the group audit team on certain material balances and transactions within the West Africa
Exploration entities in Burkina Faso, Guinea and Mali.
Our approach was based on a thorough understanding of Avocet Mining PLC's business and is risk based. We identified and concentrated
our resources on areas of higher risk, including those areas of concern to the directors. We undertook substantive testing on significant
transactions, account balances and disclosures, the extent of which was based on various factors such as our overall assessment of the
control environment, the effectiveness of controls over individual systems and the management of specific risks.
Our audit approach included the use of the work of auditor's experts to assist with the audit. We used the work of: an internal tax specialist 
to assist in the audit of current and deferred taxation, our internal valuations team to assist in the audit of the discount factor(s) used for the
impairment model and the going concern assessment, and a mining consultant to challenge the assumptions relating to mining engineering
used in the impairment model and the going concern assessment. We have evaluated the adequacy of the work of these experts in respect of
our audit.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing our audit, in evaluating the effect of any identified misstatements and in
forming our opinion. For the purpose of determining whether the group financial statements are free from material misstatement we define
materiality as the magnitude of a misstatement or an omission from the group financial statements or related disclosures that would make it
probable that the judgement of a reasonable person relying on the information would have been changed or influenced by the misstatement
or omission. For the group audit, we established materiality for the group financial statements as a whole to be US$1.6 million, which is 5% 
of the loss before taxation adjusted for certain non-recurring hedging transactions. For the financial information of the individual subsidiary
undertakings, we set our materiality based on a proportion of group materiality appropriate to the relative scales of each of the businesses.
We have determined the threshold at which we communicate misstatements to the Audit Committee to be US$0.08 million. In addition, we
communicate misstatements below that threshold that, in our view, warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.
Our assessment of risk
Without modifying our opinion, we highlight the following matters that are, in our judgement, likely to be most important to users'
understanding of our audit. Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the group financial
statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual transactions, account balances or disclosures.

Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
pg  
Going concern 
The accounts are prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with IAS 1  Presentation of Financial Statements'. As the directors'
assessment of the group's ability to continue as a going concern can be highly judgemental we identified going concern as a significant risk
requiring special audit consideration.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to, an evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group's ability to continue as a going
concern. In particular, we reviewed cashflow forecasts for the period to the end of the life of mine plan, performing sensitivity analysis to
assess the risk of a breach of covenants, and reviewing and challenging the directors' assumptions, including future sales of gold and the
expected market gold price. We evaluated the directors' plans for future actions in relation to its going concern assessment, taking into
account any relevant events subsequent to the year end.
The group's assessment of going concern is included in note 1 to the financial statements. Our audit report for the group and parent
company includes an emphasis of matter in respect of going concern.
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised in the financial statements in accordance with IAS 18  Revenue'. There is a presumption that there are risks of fraud
in revenue recognition because determining the appropriate timing of recognition can be judgemental. As the timing of revenue recognition
is subject to the conclusion of a trading contract on the bullion market or a relevant forward contract, which is after the gold dore is shipped
from Inata and refined into bullion in South Africa, we identified revenue recognition as a significant risk requiring special audit
consideration.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to, an evaluation of the internal controls and processes over revenue recognition and
performing substantive testing of 100 per cent of the group's revenue in the financial year including vouching to third party documentation. 
The group's accounting policy in respect of revenue recognition is included in note 3 to the group financial statements.
Management override of controls 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), for all of our audits we are required to consider the risk of management override of financial controls. Due to the
unpredictable nature of this risk we are required to assess it as a significant risk requiring special audit consideration.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to, specific procedures relating to this risk that are required by ISA 240   The Auditors
Responsibilities relating to Fraud in an Audit of Financial Statements'. This included tests of journal entries, the evaluation of judgements 
and assumptions in directors' estimates and tests of significant transactions outside the normal course of business. 
In particular, our audit work on the assumptions used within impairment calculations and going concern forecasts addressed key aspects of
ISA 240. The group's disclosures of judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements.
Impairment review of Burkina Faso property, plant and equipment and deferred exploration asset
The group's property, plant and equipment assets included on the consolidated statement of financial position of US$132 million represent 
a significant portion of the financial position of the group. In accordance with IAS 36  Impairment of assets', assets are subject to an
impairment test when there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. The directors carried out a detailed impairment assessment at 
31 December 2013, which was triggered by a reduction in the Inata Ore Reserve caused by falls in the gold price and increased costs. This
resulted in an impairment of US$3.9 million to property, plant & equipment and US$26.6 million to the Souma intangible exploration asset
based on a value in use calculation. Impairment calculations made by management are highly judgemental and have a high degree of
estimation uncertainty. We therefore identified the carrying value of property, plant and equipment as a significant risk requiring special 
audit consideration.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to, a review of the integrity of the model used by the directors for impairment calculations. 
We challenged the directors' use of and tested key assumptions, which include the weighted average cost of capital used as the discount
rate, the expected future revenue and costs which are based on future gold production and the estimated future market price of gold. 
The group's disclosures of judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty relating to property, plant and equipment are disclosed in notes
2 and 7 to the group financial statements. The group's accounting policy in respect of property, plant and equipment is included in note 3 to
the group financial statements.
Carrying value of Guinea deferred exploration expenditure (intangible asset)
The group has incurred significant exploration costs for sites in Guinea of US$23.2 million net of US$7.3m impairment, which have been
capitalised as intangible assets in accordance with IFRS 6  Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources'. The process to measure the
carrying value of exploration costs that can be recognised as intangible assets in the group financial statements involves judgement by the
directors. We therefore identified the carrying value of exploration expenditure included as intangible assets as a significant risk requiring
special audit consideration.  pg  
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to, understanding the process and controls management put in place in identifying costs 
that meet capitalisation criteria. We obtained evidence that Avocet has valid permits to exploit the related intangible asset. We examined
calculations prepared by the directors to consider the potential value in use and the best information available to the directors to reflect the
amount that they could obtain, at the end of the reporting period, from the disposal of the asset and recent transactions of similar assets to
assess the fair value less costs to sell. We have assessed and challenged the directors' judgements surrounding the feasibility of the
projects, the best information available and evidence of recent transactions, including the need for future funding in forming their
assessment of the recoverable amount to ensure that their carrying value is appropriate. 
The group's disclosures of judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty relating to deferred exploration expenditure are disclosed in
notes 2 and 7 to the group financial statements. The group's accounting policy in respect of intangible assets is included in note 3 to the
group financial statements.
Burkina Faso taxes
Following a tax audit by the Burkino Faso authorities, the group received a tax claim of US$4.9 million that has not been settled by the group
and is considered a contingent liability in accordance with IAS 37  Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets'. In addition,
included within the VAT debtor of US$13.1 million are amounts due to the group in respect of historic balances of US$5.8 million that have
not yet been settled by the authorities. The directors have exercised significant judgement in applying the appropriate recognition criteria to
contingent liabilities and assets, and we therefore identified the recognition of the Burkina Faso taxes as a significant risk requiring special
audit consideration.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to, reviewing correspondence with the Burkino Faso authorities and interviews with local 
staff responsible for negotiating the group's tax positions with the Burkina Faso authorities. For the contingent liability, we challenged the
directors' judgements surrounding the non-recognition of an additional tax provision. For the recognition of the VAT debtor, we reviewed the
re-submission of VAT balances with supporting documentation and challenged the directors' judgements surrounding the recoverability of
the historic VAT balances to ensure that their carrying value is appropriate.
The group's disclosures of judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty relating to taxation and VAT recoverability are disclosed in note
2 to the group financial statements. The contingent liability in relation to the remaining disputed tax claim is further disclosed in note 32 to
the group financial statements.
Carrying value of intercompany loan and debtor balances within the parent company
The impairment and going concern issues identified as risks to the group financial statements also have an impact on the recoverability of
the intercompany assets included in the parent company balance sheet. We therefore identified the recoverability of intercompany balances
as a significant risk requiring special audit consideration within the parent company.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to, confirming intercompany balances included within the parent company and auditing the
key judgements and estimates included in the impairment review, critically reviewing and challenging the directors' assumptions, including
future sales of gold and the expected market gold price. 
The parent company's accounting policy in respect of intercompany investments is included in note 37 to the group financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
  give a true and fair view of the state of the group's affairs as 31 December 2013 and of its loss for the year then ended; 
  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Emphasis of matter - Going concern
In forming our opinion on the group financial statements, which is not modified, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosure made in
note 1 to the group financial statements concerning the group's ability to continue as a going concern.
As explained in note 1, at 31 December 2013 the group had not repaid the US$15 million loan due to an affiliate of Elliott Associates, its
largest shareholder, which had been due on 31 December 2013. The directors have prepared a revised Life of Mine Plan which has identified
negative cash flows in 2014. As a consequence there is a requirement for further short term funding in 2014 amounting to between US$20
million and US$30 million. The directors announced a business review on 20 December 2013 in response to this funding requirement and
disclosed various options for maximising the value of the group's assets for the benefits of shareholders, namely at Inata, Souma and
Guinea. The aim of the review, which remains ongoing, is to secure sufficient funding to address the outstanding US$15 million Elliott loan
and Inata's US$20 - US$30 million deficit, for a total of up to US$45 million. As further explained in note 1, while initial discussions with
interested parties are ongoing, the directors have not yet secured this funding.

These conditions, along with the other matters explained in note 1 to the group financial statements indicate the existence of a material
uncertainty that casts significant doubt over the group's ability to continue as a going concern. The group financial statements do not
include the adjustments that would result if the group was unable to continue as a going concern.
Other reporting responsibilities
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
  the information given in the Strategic Report and the and Director's Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the group financial statements; and
  the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on pages 37 to 43 with respect to internal control and risk
management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures is consistent with the group
financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
  under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
  materially inconsistent with the information in the audited group financial statements; or
  apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group acquired in the course of
performing our audit; or
  is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit
and the directors' statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report
appropriately discloses those matters that were communicated to the audit committee which we consider should have been disclosed.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
  certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
  a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by the company.
Under the Listing Rules are required to review:
  the directors' statement, set out on page 35, in relation to going concern; and 
  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company's compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate
Governance Code specified for our review.
Other matter  
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Avocet Mining PLC for the year ended 31 December 2013 and on
the information in the Directors' Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited. That report includes an emphasis of matter.
