Part 1 of this Report sets out the Company's remuneration policies for the Directors for the year ended 30 September 2006.
These policies are likely to continue to apply in future years, unless there are specific reasons for change, in which case
shareholders will be informed appropriately. Part 2 sets out audited details of the remuneration received by Directors during the
year ended 30 September 2006.
PART 1. REMUNERATION POLICIES (NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT)
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors and for
determining their individual packages and terms of service. In establishing this policy, and to ensure consistency with the
arrangements for other management levels, the Remuneration Committee has regard to pay and conditions throughout the Group
and is also responsible for the remuneration packages of key senior executives. The Committee's terms of reference are available
on the Company's website and on request from the Company Secretary.
The Committee met five times during the year and currently comprises Mr. B. Duckworth (Chairman), Mr. T.C. Bonner, and
Mrs. S J Pirie. As disclosed in last year's report, Mr. Priestley retired from the Board at the conclusion of the Annual General
Meeting on 19 January 2006 and was replaced as Chairman of the Committee by Mr. B. Duckworth. The Chief Executive,
Mr. T.K.P . Stead and the Group Director of Human Resources, Mr. S.D. Wright, are invited to attend meetings except when matters
relating to their own remuneration arrangements are discussed. The Committee also uses external independent professional
advisers. Towers Perrin are the Committee's remuneration consultants and provide advice primarily on competitive market levels
and on the performance-related elements of the Executive Directors' remuneration. Towers Perrin also provide administration
services to the Company's employee share trust. The Company has appointed KPMG as its independent actuarial advisors on
pension matters and KPMG will provide the Committee with information on executive pension arrangements when required.
Linklaters and TLT, the Company's appointed legal advisers, provide legal advice when required. New Bridge Street Consultants
provide performance monitoring data for review by the Committee in relation to the Performance Share Plan (see below).
Guiding Policy
The Remuneration Committee's aim is to ensure that the structure of the Executive Directors' remuneration supports the
achievement of the Company's performance objectives and, in turn, increases shareholder value. The Remuneration Committee
reviews executive remuneration arrangements regularly to ensure that they remain effective, competitive and appropriate to the
Group's circumstances and prospects, and monitors incentive award levels and consequent company liabilities.
The Company's guiding policy on Executive Directors' remuneration is that:
the Executive Directors' remuneration packages should take into account the linkage between pay and performance by both
rewarding effective management and by making the enhancement of shareholder value a critical success factor in the setting of
incentives, both in the short and the long term; and
the overall level of salary, incentives, pension and other benefits should be competitive when compared with other
manufacturing companies of a similar size and global spread.
Remuneration Elements
The Executive Directors' remuneration comprises four elements: annual salary; short-term bonus; longer-term performance shares
and other benefits (including pension). In line with the Company's emphasis on performance-related pay, bonus payments are
dependent on the Company's annual financial performance, while the receipt of performance shares is dependent on enhanced
relative returns to shareholders over a three-year period. The arrangements are similar for other senior executive team members.
The following table illustrates the proportion of variable pay to base salary for the Chief Executive and the Finance Director for
2006/7, assuming target or maximum performance related pay.
Proportion of Performance Related Pay to Salary
Salary
In setting salary levels, the Remuneration Committee considers the experience and responsibility of the Executive Directors and
their personal performance during the previous year. The Committee also takes account of salary levels within other companies of
a similar size and global spread, as well as the rates of increases for other employees within the Company. The Remuneration
Committee reviews salaries with effect from January each year.
The annual base salary as at 30 September 2006 for Mr. T.K.P . Stead is  215,000 and for Mr. P .C. Slabbert is  128,000.

Remuneration Report
for the year ended 30 September 2006 Annual Bonus
The Executive Directors' annual bonus arrangements are focused on the achievement of the Company's short-term financial
objectives. Before the start of each year, the Remuneration Committee sets financial performance targets for the year. These are
designed to be stretching and for the bonus for 2006/7 will be based on two measures, profit before interest and tax and cash
flow. The maximum bonus potential for 2006/7 is 60% of salary for the Chief Executive and 50% of salary for the Finance
Director. Bonus payments are not pensionable. 
Performance Share Plan
The Remuneration Committee introduced this Plan with shareholder approval at the AGM in 2002. It came into effect from 1
October 2001, with the aim of motivating Executive Directors and other senior executives to achieve performance superior to the
Company's peers and to deliver sustainable improvement in shareholder returns. This is reflected in the Plan's performance
condition which compares the total return received by the Company's shareholders in terms of share price growth and dividends
(total shareholder return or TSR ) over a period of time with the total returns received by shareholders in companies within a pre-
determined and appropriate comparator group.
Under the Plan, Executive Directors and a limited number of other senior executives receive conditional share awards (which may
be in the form of nil-cost options) in respect of the Company's shares. The actual number of shares that each participant receives
depends on the Company's TSR performance over a three-year period compared to the TSR performance within a comparator
group comprising the FTSE SmallCap index, excluding investment trusts. Over a three year period:
If the Company's TSR performance is below the median TSR of the comparator group, no shares will vest.
If the Company's TSR performance is equal to the median TSR of the comparator group, 40% of the shares may vest.
If the Company's TSR performance is equal to, or exceeds, the upper quartile TSR of the comparator group 100% of the shares
may vest.
If the Company's TSR performance is between the median and upper quartile TSR of the comparator group, shares may vest on
a pro-rata basis.
The above schedule reflects the Remuneration Committee's intention to reward only TSR performance which outperforms the
comparator group. In addition, the Committee may reduce the number of shares which will vest or decide that no shares will vest
if it considers that the financial performance of the Company or the performance of the participant does not justify vesting.
The maximum value that can be granted under the Plan in any year is 100% of salary. It is the Remuneration Committee's current
intention that, as before, only the Chief Executive should receive the maximum conditional grant, with the Finance Director
receiving 80% of salary.
As reported last year, the Remuneration Committee determined that the 2002/3 conditional award should not vest.
The Company's TSR performance in respect of the 2003/4 conditional award did not exceed the median performance of the
comparator group, as calculated by New Bridge Street Consultants. The Committee determined in October 2006, therefore, that
the award should not vest.
Shareholding Guidelines
Under shareholding guidelines approved during 2004, Executive Directors and other senior executives participating in the
Performance Share Plan during the year are required to build up and retain a shareholding in the Company. For Executive
Directors the shareholding requirement is equivalent to 1.5 times base salary and for senior executives the shareholding
requirement is equivalent to 1.0 times base salary. The Executive Directors and senior executives are required to retain a portion
of any awards that vest under the Performance Share Plan until their respective shareholding guideline is met.
Dilution
The Company reviews the awards of shares made under the various all-employee and executive share plans in terms of their
effect on dilution limits. In respect of the 5% and 10% limits recommended by the Association of British Insurers, the relevant
percentages were 1.09% and 4.81% respectively based on the issued share capital at 30 September 2006. It has been the
Company's practice to buy shares in the market through an Employee Share Ownership Trust in order to meet its liability for
shares awarded under the Performance Share Plan. At 30 September 2006 there were 666,190 shares held in the Employee
Share Ownership Trust which, in the Remuneration Committee's opinion, are adequate to cover the number of shares considered
likely to vest in relation to awards granted under the Performance Share Plan to date.
Pension and other benefits
The current Executive Directors (Mr. T.K.P . Stead and Mr. P .C. Slabbert) are both based in the UK and are members of the Senior
Executive Section of the Avon Rubber Retirement and Death Benefits Plan. This provides members with a defined level of benefit
on retirement depending on length of service and earnings. Members can receive a pension of up to two-thirds of pensionable
salary on retirement from age 60, provided the minimum service requirement of 20 years has been met. On death in service, a
lump sum of four times pensionable salary is paid, along with a spouses' pension of one half of the member's prospective
pension. When an Executive Director dies after retirement, a spouse's pension of one half of the member's pension is paid.
Directors' basic salaries are the only pensionable element of their remuneration packages. The Executive Directors, like all
members, are required to make contributions to the scheme at a rate of 7.5% of salary.
In line with Company policy for new employees in the UK, any UK-based Executive Directors joining the Company with effect from
1 February 2003 will be offered defined contribution arrangements.
Avon Rubber p.l.c. Annual Report 2006 15 16
Remuneration Report continued
for the year ended 30 September 2006
The Company has reviewed the pension arrangements it provides to UK-based Executive Directors as a result of the UK legislation
introduced in April 2006 affecting the taxation of pensions, in particular removing the earnings cap and introducing a lifetime
allowance. As a result of the removal of the earnings cap, a pension supplement in respect of salary above the cap is no longer
required for Mr T. K. P . Stead.
Executive Directors are entitled to participate in employee healthcare plans and to receive a car allowance and related expenses.
Executive Directors are also entitled to participate in the Company's Inland Revenue approved Sharesave Option Scheme, which
is open to all UK employees with three months continuous service and to which no performance conditions are attached.
Neither of the Executive Directors is currently appointed as a non-executive director of any limited company outside the Group.
The Remuneration Committee will establish a policy on the treatment of any fees received by Executive Directors in respect of such
non-executive roles when required.
Contracts
The Company's policy is that Executive Directors should normally be employed on a contract which may be terminated either by
the Company or the Executive Director giving 12 months notice and which otherwise expires on retirement, currently at age 60.
The Company may terminate the contract early without cause by making a payment in lieu of notice by monthly instalments of
salary and benefits to a maximum of 12 months, with reductions for any amounts received from providing services to others
during this period.
The Remuneration Committee may vary these terms if the particular circumstances surrounding the appointment of a new
Executive Director demand it. The Remuneration Committee strongly endorses the obligation on an Executive Director to mitigate
any loss on early termination and will seek to reduce the amount payable on termination where it is appropriate to do so. The
Committee will also take care to ensure that, while meeting its contractual obligations, poor performance is not rewarded.
The Executive Directors' contracts contain early termination provisions consistent with the policy outlined above. 
The table below summarises key details in respect of each Executive Director's contract.

T.K.P . Stead 4 July 2005 3 12 months 12 months
P .C. Slabbert 4 July 2005 16 12 months 12 months
CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors receive a fixed fee in cash for their services. Fee levels are determined by the Board in
light of market research and advice provided by Hanson Green, which also provides services in connection with the proposed
recruitment of new Non-Executive Directors. Fee levels are reviewed from time to time. The Chairman and the Non-Executive
Directors do not participate in any Board discussions or vote on their own remuneration, nor do they participate in any incentive
or benefit plans.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors each have a letter of appointment which specifies an initial period of
appointment. The initial period for Mr. Duckworth is 5 years. The initial period for Mrs. Pirie is 3 years and Mr. Bonner's current
period of appointment is also for a period of three years. Sir Richard Needham's appointment is for an initial period of three years
subject to annual review. Chairman and Non-Executive Director appointments are subject to Board approval and election by
shareholders at the annual general meeting following appointment and, thereafter, re-election by rotation every three years. The
Chairman and any Non-Executive Director who has served for more than 9 years since first election are subject to annual re-
election by shareholders. There are no provisions for compensation payments on early termination in the Chairman's and the
Non-Executive Directors' letters of appointment. The date of each appointment is set out below, together with the date of their last
re-election.

* Mr. G.T.E. Priestley resigned as a Director on 19 January 2006.
Additionally, the Company has operated a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust (Quest ) which was used to deliver shares to
employees exercising their options under the  Sharesave Option Scheme. By virtue of their participation, or potential participation, in
that Scheme, Mr. P .C. Slabbert and Mr. T.K.P . Stead had an interest in the shares held by the Quest at 30 September 2006. At that
date 396 shares were held in the Quest (2005: 55,712 shares).
The register of Directors' interests contains details of Directors' shareholdings and share options.
Except for the purchase by Mr. B. Duckworth of 25,000 shares on 14 December 2006 at the price of 154 pence, there were no
movements in Directors' shareholdings between the end of the financial year and 19 December 2006.
Additional information
As previously anticipated in the shareholder circular issued in connection with the Extraordinary General Meeting of 13 June 2006,
Mr. L.J. Richards, a former Executive Director of the Company, and other members of the Avon Automotive management team
received a payment from the Company on successful completion of the disposal of Avon Automotive. In the case of Mr. L.J. Richards,
this payment was  311,458. Under the terms of these payments, Mr. L.J. Richards and any other member of the Avon Automotive
management team who had been granted conditional awards under the Performance Share Plan, relinquished all rights to those
awards. The terms of the transaction with Mr. L.J. Richards were confirmed to the UK Listing Authority by ING Corporate Finance as
being fair and reasonable so far as the shareholders were concerned.
In addition, the two executive directors were paid one-off bonuses as a reward for the successful disposal of Avon Automotive. Mr.
T.K.P . Stead was awarded  30,000 and Mr. P .C. Slabbert was awarded  20,000, in each case before tax. The Remuneration
Committee approved these payments and considered them appropriate given the importance of the transaction in the successful
development of the Group's strategy.

Executive Directors' pensions
The Stock Exchange Listing Rules require the disclosure of certain additional information relating to the pensions of Executive
Directors under defined benefit schemes. This information is set out below.
T.K.P . Stead P .C. Slabbert
Accrued entitlement as at 30 September 2006  30,598p.a.  24,175p.a.
Increase in accrued entitlement over the period  6,094p.a.  8,712p.a.
Contributions paid by each Director over the period  12,079  9,600
Transfer value at 30 September 2005  382,498  124,803
Transfer value at 30 September 2006 or date of retirement if earlier  541,739  227,850
Increase in the transfer value over the year (net of Director's contributions)  147,162  93,447
Increase in accrued entitlement over the period (excluding inflation of 3.1%)  5,432p.a.  8,294p.a.
Transfer value of increase in accrued pension (net of Director's contributions)  84,096  68,575
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to
another pension provider on transferring the scheme's liability in respect of the directors' pension benefits. They do not represent
sums payable to individual directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The accrued entitlement shown is the amount that would be paid each year at normal retirement age, based on service to the end of
the current year. The accrued lump sum, under the defined benefit scheme, for the highest paid director at 30 September 2006 was
 138,438 (2005:  55,134).
