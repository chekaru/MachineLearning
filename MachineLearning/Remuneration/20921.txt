 Part 1 of this Report sets out the Company's remuneration policies for the Directors for the year ended 30 September 2008. These
policies are likely to continue to apply in future years, unless there are specific reasons for change, in which case shareholders will be
informed appropriately. Part 2 sets out audited details of the remuneration received by Directors during the year ended 30
September 2008.
PART 1. REMUNERATION POLICIES (NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT)
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors and for determining
their individual packages and terms of service. In establishing this policy, and to ensure consistency with the arrangements for other
management levels, the Remuneration Committee has regard to pay and conditions throughout the Group and is also responsible
for the remuneration packages of key senior executives. The Committee's terms of reference are available on the Company's website. 
The Committee met seven times during the year. The composition of the Committee has remained unchanged during the year and
comprises Mr. D.R. Evans (Chairman), Sir Richard Needham and Mrs. S.J. Pirie. The Chief Executive, Mr. P .C.Slabbert and the Group
Director of Human Resources, Mr. S.D. Wright, are invited to attend meetings except when matters relating to their own remuneration
arrangements are discussed. The Committee also uses external independent professional advisers. Towers Perrin are the Committee's
remuneration consultants and provide advice primarily on competitive market levels and on the performance-related elements of
the Executive Directors' remuneration. Towers Perrin, through Excellerate HRO, also provide administration services to the Company's
employee share trust. KPMG is the Company's independent actuarial advisor on pension matters and KPMG will provide the
Committee with information on executive pension arrangements when required. TLT, the Company's appointed legal advisers,
provide legal advice when required. New Bridge Street Consultants provide performance monitoring data for review by the
Committee in relation to the Performance Share Plan (see below).
Guiding policy 
The Remuneration Committee's aim is to ensure that the structure of the Executive Directors' remuneration supports the
achievement of the Company's performance objectives and, in turn, increases shareholder value. The Remuneration Committee
reviews executive remuneration arrangements regularly to ensure that they remain effective, competitive and appropriate to the
Group's circumstances and prospects, and monitors incentive award levels and consequent company liabilities. 
The Company's guiding policy on Executive Directors' remuneration is that: 
the Executive Directors' remuneration packages should take into account the linkage between pay and performance by both 
rewarding effective management and by making the enhancement of shareholder value a critical success factor in the setting of 
incentives, both in the short and the long term; and 
the overall level of salary, incentives, pension and other benefits should be competitive when compared with other 
manufacturing companies of a similar size and global spread.
Remuneration elements
The Executive Directors' remuneration comprises four elements: annual salary; short-term bonus; longer-term performance shares
and other benefits (including pension). In line with the Company's emphasis on performance-related pay, bonus payments are
dependent on the Company's annual financial performance, while the receipt of performance shares is dependent on enhanced
relative returns to shareholders over a three-year period. The arrangements are similar for other senior executive team members. The
following table illustrates the proportion of variable pay to base salary for the Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director for
2008/9, assuming target or maximum performance related pay.
Proportion of performance related pay to salary 
Salary
In setting salary levels, the Remuneration Committee considers the experience and responsibility of the Executive Directors and their
personal performance during the previous year. The Committee also takes account of salary levels within other companies of a
similar size and global spread, as well as the rates of increases for other employees within the Company. The Remuneration
Committee reviews salaries with effect from January each year. 
The annual base salary as at 30 September 2008 for Mr. P .C. Slabbert is  215,000 and for Mr. A.G. Lewis is  130,000.

Annual bonus
The Executive Directors' annual bonus arrangements are focused on the achievement of the Company's short-term financial
objectives. Before the start of each year, the Remuneration Committee sets financial performance targets for the year. These are
designed to be stretching and the 2008/9 bonus will be based entirely on profit before interest and tax. The maximum bonus
potential for 2008/9 under these arrangements is 60% of salary for the Chief Executive and 50% of salary for the Group Finance
Director. Bonus payments are not pensionable. 
Profit Incentive Bonus Scheme
In 2008 the Remuneration Committee approved the continuation of the Profit Incentive Bonus Scheme as a short-term measure to
focus the attention of those managers at Grade 4 and above on the immediate objective of improving the Group's profitability.
Performance is measured quarterly against a budgeted corporate profit before interest and tax figure. When this is equalled or
exceeded, participants receive $5,000. The maximum annual bonus amount is $20,000. The Executive Directors participate in the
scheme as part of the eligible group. The scheme operated throughout the last financial year, but no awards were payable.
Performance Share Plan
The Remuneration Committee introduced this Plan with shareholder approval at the AGM in 2002. It came into effect from 1 October
2001, with the aim of motivating Executive Directors and other senior executives to achieve performance superior to the Company's
peers and to deliver sustainable improvement in shareholder returns. This is reflected in the Plan's performance condition which
compares the total return received by the Company's shareholders in terms of share price growth and dividends (total shareholder
return or TSR ) over a period of time with the total returns received by shareholders in companies within a pre-determined and
appropriate comparator group. 
Under the Plan, Executive Directors and a limited number of other senior executives receive conditional share awards (which may be
in the form of nil-cost options) in respect of the Company's shares. The actual number of shares that each participant receives
depends on the Company's TSR performance over a three-year period compared to the TSR performance within a comparator group
comprising the FTSE SmallCap index, excluding investment trusts. Over a three year period: 
If the Company's TSR performance is below the median TSR of the comparator group, no shares will vest. 
If the Company's TSR performance is equal to the median TSR of the comparator group, 40% of the shares may vest. 
If the Company's TSR performance is equal to, or exceeds, the upper quartile TSR of the comparator group, 100% of the
shares may vest. 
If the Company's TSR performance is between the median and upper quartile TSR of the comparator group, shares may vest on a 
pro-rata basis. 
The above schedule reflects the Remuneration Committee's intention to reward only TSR performance which outperforms the
comparator group. In addition, the Committee may reduce the number of shares which will vest or decide that no shares will vest if
it considers that the financial performance of the Company or the performance of the participant does not justify vesting. 
The maximum value that can be granted under the Plan in any year is 100% of salary. It is the Remuneration Committee's current
intention that, as before, only the Chief Executive should receive the maximum conditional grant, with the Group Finance Director
receiving 80% of salary. 
As reported last year, the Remuneration Committee determined that the 2004/5 conditional award should not vest. 
The Company's TSR performance in respect of the 2005/6 conditional award did not exceed the median performance of the
comparator group, as calculated by New Bridge Street Consultants. The Committee therefore determined in October 2008 that the
2005/6 award should not vest.

AvonRubberp.l.c. Shareholding guidelines
Under shareholding guidelines approved during 2004, Executive Directors and other senior executives participating in the
Performance Share Plan during the year are required to build up and retain a shareholding in the Company. For Executive Directors
the shareholding requirement is equivalent to 1.5 times base salary and for senior executives the shareholding requirement is
equivalent to 1.0 times base salary. Executive Directors and senior executives are required to retain a portion of any awards that vest
under the Performance Share Plan until their respective shareholding guideline is met. 
Dilution
The Company reviews the awards of shares made under the various all-employee and executive share plans in terms of their effect on
dilution limits. In respect of the 5% and 10% limits recommended by the Association of British Insurers, the relevant percentages were
2.5% and 3% respectively based on the issued share capital at 30 September 2008. It has been the Company's practice to use an
Employee Share Ownership Trust in order to meet its liability for shares awarded under the Performance Share Plan. At 30 September
2008 there were 666,191 shares held in the Employee Share Ownership Trust which, in the Remuneration Committee's opinion, are
adequate to cover the number of shares considered likely to vest in relation to awards granted under the Performance Share Plan to
date.  
Pensions and other benefits
The current Executive Directors (Mr. P .C. Slabbert and Mr. A.G. Lewis) are both based in the UK and are members of the Avon Rubber
Retirement and Death Benefits Plan. Mr. Slabbert is a member of the Senior Executive Section which provides members with a
defined level of benefit on retirement depending on length of service and earnings. Members can receive a pension of up to two-
thirds of pensionable salary on retirement from age 60, provided the minimum service requirement of 20 years has been met. On
death in service, a lump sum of four times pensionable salary is paid, along with a spouse's pension of one half of the member's
prospective pension. When an Executive Director dies after retirement, a spouse's pension of one half of the member's pension is
paid. Mr. Slabbert, like all members, is required to make contributions to the scheme at a rate of 7.5% of salary.
In line with Company policy for new employees in the UK, any UK-based Executive Directors joining the Company with effect from 1
February 2003 are offered defined contribution arrangements. Mr. Lewis is therefore a member of the money purchase section of the
Plan. Members receive a pension based upon the size of their retirement account on retirement from age 65. On death in service, a
lump sum of four times pensionable salary is paid, along with a spouse's pension of one quarter of the member's pensionable salary.
Mr. Lewis, like all members, can make contributions to the scheme at rates of between 2% and 15% of salary.
Directors' basic salaries are the only pensionable element of their remuneration packages. 
Executive Directors are entitled to participate in employee healthcare plans and to receive a car allowance and related expenses.
Executive Directors are also entitled to participate in the Company's Inland Revenue approved Sharesave Option Scheme, although
this did not run in the year to 30 September 2008. 
Neither of the Executive Directors is currently appointed as a non-executive director of any limited company outside the Group. The
Remuneration Committee will establish a policy on the treatment of any fees received by Executive Directors in respect of such non-
executive roles when required.
Contracts
The Company's policy is that Executive Directors should normally be employed on a contract which may be terminated either by the
Company or the Executive Director giving 12 months notice and which otherwise expires on retirement, currently at age 60 for Mr.
Slabbert and age 65 for Mr. Lewis. The Company may terminate the contract early without cause by making a payment in lieu of
notice by monthly installments of salary and benefits to a maximum of 12 months, with reductions for any amounts received from
providing services to others during this period. 
The Remuneration Committee may vary these terms if the particular circumstances surrounding the appointment of a new Executive
Director demand it. The Remuneration Committee strongly endorses the obligation on an Executive Director to mitigate any loss on
early termination and will seek to reduce the amount payable on termination where it is appropriate to do so. The Committee will
also take care to ensure that, while meeting its contractual obligations, poor performance is not rewarded. The Executive Directors'
contracts contain early termination provisions consistent with the policy outlined above.
The table below summarises key details in respect of each Executive Director's contract.

Mr. T.K.P . Stead stood down from the role of Chief Executive on 21 April 2008. Under the terms of this arrangement Mr. Stead remains
an employee of the Company on garden leave until 15 May 2009, at which point his employment will come to an end.

CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors receive a fixed fee in cash for their services. Fee levels are determined by the Board in light
of market research and advice provided by Hanson Green, which also provides services in connection with the proposed recruitment
of new Non-Executive Directors. Fee levels are reviewed from time to time. The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors do not
participate in any Board discussions or vote on their own remuneration, nor do they participate in any incentive or benefit plans. 
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors each have a letter of appointment which specifies an initial period of appointment.
The initial period for Mrs. Pirie was three years and this was extended for a further three years on 1 March 2008. Sir Richard Needham's
and Mr. Evans' appointments are also for an initial period of three years subject to review after the first 12 months. Chairman and Non-
Executive Director appointments are subject to Board approval and election by shareholders at the annual general meeting following
appointment and, thereafter, re-election by rotation every three years. The Chairman and any Non-Executive Director who has served
for more than nine years since first election are subject to annual re-election by shareholders. There are no provisions for
compensation payments on early termination in the Chairman's and the Non-Executive Directors' letters of appointment. The date of
each appointment is set out below, together with the date of their last re-election.

Executive Directors' pensions
The Stock Exchange Listing Rules require the disclosure of certain additional information relating to the pensions of Executive Directors
under defined benefit schemes. This information is set out below.
T.K.P . Stead P .C. Slabbert
Accrued entitlement as at 30 September 2008  48,311 p.a.  42,454 p.a.
Increase in accrued entitlement over the period  9,529 p.a.  14,174 p.a.
Contributions paid by each Director over the period  16,770  12,840
Transfer value at 30 September 2007  744,541  280,847
Transfer value at 30 September 2008 or date of retirement if earlier  979,139  468,365
Increase in the transfer value over the year (net of Director's contributions)  217,828  174,678
Increase in accrued entitlement over the period (excluding inflation of 3.9%)  8,017 p.a.  13,071 p.a.
Transfer value of increase in accrued pension (net of Director's contributions)  145,704  131,361
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another
pension provider on transferring the scheme's liability in respect of the Directors' pension benefits. They do not represent sums payable
to individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The accrued entitlement shown is the amount that would be paid each year at normal retirement age, based on service to the end of
the current year. The accrued lump sum, under the defined benefit scheme, for the highest paid director at 30 September 2008 was
 212,270 (2007:  181,520).
