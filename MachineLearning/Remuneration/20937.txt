Remuneration Report
for the year ended 30 September 2009
38
Part 1 of this Report sets out the Company's remuneration policies for the Directors for the year ended 30 September 2009. These 
policies are likely to continue to apply in future years, unless there are specific reasons for change, in which case shareholders will 
be informed appropriately. Part 2 sets out audited details of the remuneration received by Directors during the year ended 30 
September 2009.
PART 1. REMUNERATION POLICIES (NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT)
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors and for determining 
their individual packages and terms of service. In establishing this policy, and to ensure consistency with the arrangements for other 
management levels, the Remuneration Committee has regard to pay and conditions throughout the Group and is also responsible 
for setting the remuneration packages of the executive management team. The Committee's terms of reference are available on the 
Company's website. 
The Committee met 5 times during the year. The composition of the Committee has remained unchanged during the year 
and comprises Mr. D.R. Evans (Chairman), Sir Richard Needham and Mrs. S.J. Pirie. The Chief Executive, Mr. P.C. Slabbert and the 
Company Secretary, Mr. M. Ingrey-Counter, are invited to attend meetings except when matters relating to their own remuneration 
arrangements are discussed. The Committee also uses external independent professional advisers. During the year an executive salary 
benchmarking report was commissioned from Ernst & Young LLP.  KPMG is the Company's independent actuarial advisor on pension 
matters and  will provide the Committee with information on executive pension arrangements when required. New Bridge Street 
Consultants provide performance monitoring data for review by the Committee in relation to the Performance Share Plan.
Guiding policy 
The Remuneration Committee's aim is to ensure that the structure of executive remuneration supports the achievement of the 
Company's performance objectives and, in turn, increases shareholder value. The Remuneration Committee reviews executive 
remuneration arrangements regularly to ensure that they remain effective, competitive and appropriate to the Group's circumstances 
and prospects, and monitors incentive award levels and consequent company liabilities.  
The Company's guiding policy on executive remuneration is that: 
 executive remuneration packages should take into account the linkage between pay and performance by both rewarding   
 effective management and by making the enhancement of shareholder value a critical success factor in the setting of incentives,  
 both in the short and the long term; and 
 the overall level of salary, incentives, pension and other benefits should be competitive when compared with other companies of  
 a similar size and global spread.  
Remuneration elements 
Executive remuneration comprises four elements: annual salary; short-term bonus; longer-term performance shares and other 
benefits (including pension). In line with the Company's emphasis on performance-related pay, bonus payments are dependent on 
the Company's annual financial performance, while the receipt of performance shares is dependent on enhanced relative returns 
to shareholders over a three-year period. The following table illustrates the proportion of variable pay to base salary for the Chief 
Executive and the Group Finance Director for 2009/10, assuming target or maximum performance related pay.
Proportion of performance related pay to salary 
Salary
In setting salary levels, the Remuneration Committee considers the experience and responsibility of executives and their personal 
performance during the previous year. The Committee also takes account of salary levels within other companies of a similar size 
and global spread, as well as the rates of increases for other employees within the Company. The Remuneration Committee reviews 
salaries with effect from January each year. 
The annual base salary as at 30 September 2009 for Mr. P.C.Slabbert is  220,000 and for Mr. A.G.Lewis is  135,000.

Annual bonus
The executives' annual bonus arrangements are focused on the achievement of the Company's short-term financial objectives. 
Before the start of each year, the Remuneration Committee sets financial performance targets for the year. These are designed to be 
stretching and for the bonus for 2009/10 will be based on the following:
 Group PBIT budget achievement (30%)
 Year on year PBITE growth (30%)
 The ratio of Group operating cashflow to Group operating profit (30%)
 Achievement of personal performance targets (10%)
The maximum bonus potential for 2009/10 under these arrangements is 80% of salary for the Chief Executive and 70% of salary for 
the Group Finance Director. Bonus payments are not pensionable. 
Profit Incentive Bonus Scheme (PIBS)
In 2009 the Remuneration Committee approved the continuation of the Profit Incentive Bonus Scheme as a short-term measure to 
focus the attention of the senior managers only on the immediate objective of improving the Company's profitability. Performance 
is measured quarterly against a Group budgeted profit figure. When this is equalled or exceeded, participants receive $5,000. The 
maximum annual bonus amount is $20,000. The Executive Directors and other members of the executive team participated in the 
scheme as part of the eligible group throughout the last financial year, during which three of the four awards were payable. The 
scheme will continue in 2010 but will exclude the eight members of the Executive management team.
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The Remuneration Committee introduced this Plan with shareholder approval at the AGM in 2002 and this year shareholders 
are being asked to approve a replacement. The existing Plan came into effect from 1 October 2001, with the aim of motivating 
Executive Directors and other senior executives to achieve performance superior to the Company's peers and to deliver sustainable 
improvement in shareholder returns. This is reflected in the Plan's performance condition which compares the total return received 
by the Company's shareholders in terms of share price growth and dividends (total shareholder return or TSR ) over a period of time 
with the total returns received by shareholders in companies within a predetermined and appropriate comparator group. 
Under the Plan, Executive Directors and a limited number of other senior executives receive conditional share awards (which may 
be in the form of nil-cost options) in respect of the Company's shares. The actual number of shares that each participant receives 
depends on the Company's TSR performance over a three-year period compared to the TSR performance within a comparator group 
comprising the FTSE Small Cap index, excluding investment trusts. Over a three year period: 
 If the Company's TSR performance is below the median TSR of the comparator group, no shares will vest.
 If the Company's TSR performance is equal to the median TSR of the comparator group, 40% of the shares may vest.
 If the Company's TSR performance is equal to, or exceeds, the upper quartile TSR of the comparator group, 100% of the
 shares may vest. 
 If the Company's TSR performance is between the median and upper quartile TSR of the comparator group, shares may vest on a  
 pro-rata basis. 
The above schedule reflects the Remuneration Committee's intention to reward only TSR performance which outperforms the 
comparator group and the same measures are proposed for the 2010 Plan. In addition, the Committee may reduce the number 
of shares which will vest or decide that no shares will vest if it considers that the financial performance of the Company or the 
performance of the participant does not justify vesting. 
The maximum value that can be granted under the Plan in any year is 100% of salary. It is the Remuneration Committee's current 
intention that, as before, only the Chief Executive should receive the maximum conditional grant, with the Group Finance Director 
receiving 80% of salary.

Performance graph
The following graph illustrates 
the total return, in terms of share 
price growth and dividends on 
a notional investment of  100 in 
the Company over the last three 
years relative to the FTSE Small 
Cap Index (excluding investment 
trusts). This index was chosen by 
the Remuneration Committee 
as a competitive indicator of 
general UK market performance 
for companies of a similar size.
As announced to shareholders in January 2009, the 2008/9 conditional awards were made following the surrender of 2006/2007 and 
2007/2008 awards totalling 386,801 shares previously granted under the Plan. At the time the Committee confirmed that it believed 
the surrender and grant aligned Executive Director and other recipients' interests with those of shareholders and the Committee 
remains of this view. As reported last year, the Remuneration Committee determined that the 2005/6 conditional award should not 
vest. 
The Company's TSR performance in respect of the 2006/7 conditional award did not exceed the median performance of the 
comparator group, as calculated by New Bridge Street Consultants. The Committee therefore determined in October 2009 that the 
2006/7 award, of which a limited number of awards were still outstanding in the hands of ex-employees, should not vest. 
Shareholding guidelines
Under shareholding guidelines approved during 2004, executives participating in the Performance Share Plan during the year are 
required to build up and retain a shareholding in the Company. For Executive Directors the shareholding requirement is equivalent 
to 1.5 times base salary and for other executives the shareholding requirement is equivalent to 1.0 times base salary. The Executive 
Directors and senior executives are required to retain a portion of any awards that vest under the Performance Share Plan until their 
respective shareholding guideline is met. 
Dilution
The Company reviews the awards of shares made under the various all-employee and executive share plans in terms of their effect 
on dilution limits. In respect of the 5% and 10% limits recommended by the Association of British Insurers, the relevant percentages 
were 4.64% and 7.03% respectively based on the issued share capital at 30 September 2009. Under the 2010 Plan it is proposed to 
increase the 5% limit to 10%.  It has been the Company's practice to use an Employee Share Ownership Trust in order to meet its 
liability for shares awarded under the Performance Share Plan. At 30 September 2009 there were 666,191 shares held in the Employee 
Share Ownership Trust which will either be used to satisfy awards granted under the Plan to date, or in connection with awards to be 
made under the 2010 Plan, if approved. A Hedging Committee has been established to ensure that the Employee Share Ownership 
Trust holds sufficient shares to satisfy existing awards made under the Plan and any future awards to be made under the 2010 Plan, if 
approved, by buying shares in the market or causing the Company to issue new shares.   
Pensions and other benefits
The current Executive Directors (Mr. P.C. Slabbert and Mr. A.G. Lewis) are both based in the UK and are members of the Avon Rubber 
Retirement and Death Benefits Plan. Until 30 September 2009, when the final salary section of the Plan closed to future accrual of 
benefits, Mr. Slabbert was a member of the Senior Executive Section which provided members with a defined level of benefit on 
retirement depending on length of service and earnings. Members can receive a pension of up to two-thirds of pensionable salary 
on retirement from age 60, provided the minimum service requirement of 20 years has been met. On death in service, a lump sum 
of four times pensionable salary is paid, along with a spouses' pension of one half of the member's prospective pension. When an 
Executive Director dies after retirement, a spouse's pension of one half of the member's pension is paid. During the year, Mr Slabbert, 
like all members, has been required to make contributions to the scheme at a rate of 7.5% of salary. For the year commencing 1 
October 2009 Mr. Slabbert is a member of the money purchase section of the Plan (see below).
In line with Company policy for new employees in the UK, any UK-based Executive Directors joining the Company with effect from 1 
February 2003 are offered defined contribution arrangements.
 
Mr. Lewis is therefore a member of the money purchase section of the Plan. Members receive a pension based upon the size of their 
retirement account on retirement from age 65. On death in service, a lump sum of four times pensionable salary is paid, along with 
a spouses' pension of one quarter of the member's pensionable salary. Both Mr Slabbert and Mr Lewis receive a company pension 
contribution of 15% of salary.

Executive Directors' basic salaries are the only pensionable element of their remuneration packages. Executive Directors are entitled 
to participate in employee healthcare plans and to receive a car allowance and related expenses. 
Neither of the Executive Directors is currently appointed as a non-executive director of any limited company outside the Group. The 
Remuneration Committee will establish a policy on the treatment of any fees received by Executive Directors in respect of such non-
executive roles when required.
Contracts
The Company's policy is that Executive Directors should normally be employed on a contract which may be terminated either by 
the Company or the Executive Director giving 12 months notice and which otherwise expires on retirement, currently at age 60 for 
Mr. Slabbert and age 65 for Mr. Lewis. The Company may terminate the contract early without cause by making a payment in lieu of 
notice by monthly instalments of salary and benefits to a maximum of 12 months, with reductions for any amounts received from 
providing services to others during this period. 
The Remuneration Committee may vary these terms if the particular circumstances surrounding the appointment of a new Executive 
Director demand it. The Remuneration Committee strongly endorses the obligation on an Executive Director to mitigate any loss on 
early termination and will seek to reduce the amount payable on termination where it is appropriate to do so. The Committee will 
also take care to ensure that, while meeting its contractual obligations, poor performance is not rewarded. The Executive Directors' 
contracts contain early termination provisions consistent with the policy outlined above.
The table below summarises key details in respect of each Executive Director's contract.

CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors receive a fixed fee for their services. Fee levels are determined by the Board in light of 
market research and advice provided by Hanson Green, which also provides services in connection with the proposed recruitment 
of new Non-Executive Directors. Fee levels are reviewed from time to time. The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors do not 
participate in any Board discussions or vote on their own remuneration, nor do they participate in any incentive or benefit plans. 
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors each have a letter of appointment which specifies an initial period of appointment. 
The initial period for Mrs. Pirie was three years and this was extended for a further three years on 1 March 2008. Sir Richard Needham's 
and Mr. Evans' appointments are also for an initial period of three years. Chairman and Non-Executive Director appointments are 
subject to Board approval and election by shareholders at the annual general meeting following appointment and, thereafter, 
re-election by rotation every three years. The Chairman and any Non-Executive Director who has served for more than nine years 
since first election are subject to annual re-election by shareholders. There are no provisions for compensation payments on early 
termination in the Chairman's and the Non-Executive Directors' letters of appointment. The date of each appointment is set out 
below, together with the date of their last re-election

** The Remuneration Committee determined at its meeting on 17 November 2009 that the criteria for making an award under the 
annual bonus scheme had been met. The sums referred to represent 91% of the maximum potential entitlement.
*** Three of the four quarterly awards were approved by the Remuneration Committee in 2009.
No Director waived emoluments in respect of the year ended 30 September 2009 (2008: nil).
Executive Directors' pensions
The Stock Exchange Listing Rules require the disclosure of certain additional information relating to the pensions of Executive 
Directors under defined benefit schemes. The information is set out below.
     
   P.C. Slabbert
     
Accrued entitlement as at 30 September 2009   60,721 p.a.
Increase in accrued entitlement over the period   18,267 p.a.
Contributions paid by each Director over the period   16,406
Transfer value at 30 September 2008   468,365
Transfer value at 30 September 2009 or date of retirement if earlier   756,064
Increase in transfer value over the year (net of Directors' contributions)   271,293
Increase in accrued entitlement over the period (excluding inflation of 5.0%)   16,144 p.a.
Transfer value of increase in accrued pension (net of Director's contributions)   184,614
In respect of Mr. A.G. Lewis, company contributions to the money purchase section of the plan were  19,875.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
Avon Rubber AR&A Back Section.indd   6 Avon Rubber AR&A Back Section.indd   6 20/1/10   10:52:43 20/1/10   10:52:43 43
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to 
another pension provider on transferring the scheme's liability in respect of Director's pension benefits. They do not represent sums 
payable to individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The accrued entitlement shown is the amount that would be paid each year at normal retirement age, based on service to the end 
of the current year. The accrued lump sum, under the defined benefit scheme, for Mr Slabbert at 30 September 2009 was  281,400 
(2008:  212,270).
Performance Share Plan 2002 (the 2002 Scheme)
For grants of options or conditional awards made to date pursuant to the 2002 Scheme, the performance conditions have been 
based on the Company's TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group, comprising the FTSE Small Cap companies (excluding 
investment trusts).
A list of the number of shares under option granted at nil cost, to Executive Directors and senior employees, prior to 30 September 
2009 and following approval of the 2002 Scheme by shareholders is set out below:
*As explained in last year's report the awards granted under the 2005/6 cycle did not vest during the year.
**The Remuneration Committee agreed on 16 October 2009 that the 2006/7 awards did not vest as the Company's TSR performance 
did not exceed the median performance of the comparator group.
***These awards were reduced to 69% of entitlement at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
****This includes awards granted to Mr. T.K.P. Stead (stood down 21 April 2008, resigned as a Director on 8 September 2008 and 
retired on 15 May 2009). All these awards were pro-rated and may vest at the end of the qualifying periods, subject to satisfaction of 
the applicable measures.
*****This figure includes 541,776 in respect of key management as defined in note 9 of the financial statements.
The market price at the award date for the 2008/9 award was 32.2 pence, for the 2007/8 award was 165.0 pence , for the 2006/7 
award was 154.0 pence and for the 2005/6 award was 172.5 pence.
Sharesave option schemes
As at 30 September 2009 none of the Directors had outstanding options relating to sharesave option schemes. Other employees 
held options over 46,252 ordinary shares (2008: 161,052), exercisable between 2008 and 2012, at option prices ranging from  1.00 to 
 1.72. All options are over ordinary shares of  1 each.
As at 30 September 2009, the market price of Avon Rubber p.l.c. shares was  0.79 (2008:  0.695). During the year the highest and 
lowest market prices were  0.875 and  0.25 respectively.
