Remuneration Report
for the year ended 30 September 2010
PART 1. REMUNERATION POLICIES (NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT) 
Part 1 of this Report sets out the Company's remuneration policies for the Directors for the year ended 30 September 2010. These policies are likely to 
continue to apply in future years, unless there are specifi c reasons for change, in which case shareholders will be informed appropriately. Part 2 sets 
out audited details of the remuneration received by Directors during the year ended 30 September 2010.
The Committee met four times during the year. The composition of the 
Committee has remained unchanged during the year and comprises Mr. 
D.R. Evans (Chairman), Sir Richard Needham and Mrs. S.J. Pirie. The Chief 
Executive, Mr. P.C. Slabbert and the Company Secretary, Mr. M. Ingrey-
Counter, are invited to attend meetings except when matters relating 
to their own remuneration arrangements are discussed. The Committee 
also uses external independent professional advisers when needed. 
Last year an executive salary benchmarking report was commissioned 
from Ernst & Young LLP.  KPMG is the Company's independent actuarial 
advisor on pension matters and will provide the Committee with 
information on executive pension arrangements when required. Hewitt 
New Bridge Street provide performance monitoring data for review by 
the Committee in relation to the Performance Share Plan.
Guiding policy
The Remuneration Committee's aim is to ensure that the structure of 
executive remuneration supports the achievement of the Company's 
performance objectives and, in turn, increases shareholder value. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews executive remuneration 
arrangements regularly to ensure that they remain eff ective, competitive 
and appropriate to the Group's circumstances and prospects, and 
monitors incentive award levels and consequent company liabilities. 
The Company's guiding policy on executive remuneration is that:
       executive remuneration packages should take into account the 
linkage between pay and performance by both rewarding eff ective 
management and by making the enhancement of shareholder value 
a critical success factor in the setting of incentives, both in the short 
and the long term; and
       the overall level of salary, incentives, pension and other benefi ts 
should be competitive when compared with other companies of a 
similar size and global spread.
Remuneration elements
Executive remuneration comprises four elements: annual salary; 
short-term bonus; longer-term performance shares and other 
benefi ts (including pension). In line with the Company's emphasis 
on performance-related pay, bonus payments are dependent on 
the Company's annual fi nancial performance, while the receipt of 
performance shares is dependent on enhanced relative returns to 
shareholders over a three-year period. The following table illustrates 
the proportion of variable pay to base salary for the Chief Executive and 
the Group Finance Director for 2010/11, assuming target or maximum 
performance related pay.
Proportion of performance related pay to salary:
T 
he Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors and for 
determining their individual packages and terms of service. In establishing this policy, and to ensure consistency with the 
arrangements for other management levels, the Remuneration Committee has regard to pay and conditions throughout 
the Group and is also responsible for setting the remuneration packages of the executive management team. The Committee's 
terms of reference are available on the Company's website.

Salary
In setting salary levels, the Remuneration Committee considers 
the experience and responsibility of executives and their personal 
performance during the previous year. The Committee also takes account 
of salary levels within other companies of a similar size and global spread, 
as well as the rates of increases for other employees within the Company. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews salaries with eff ect from January 
each year. 
The annual base salary as at 30 September 2010 for Mr. P.C.Slabbert is 
 220,000 and for Mr. A.G.Lewis is  148,000.
Annual bonus
The executives' annual bonus arrangements are focused on the 
achievement of the Company's short-term fi nancial objectives. Before 
the start of each year, the Remuneration Committee sets fi nancial 
performance targets for the year. These are designed to be stretching and 
for the bonus for 2010/11 will be based on the following:
       Group PBIT budget achievement (30%).
       Year on year PBITE growth (30%).
       The ratio of Group operating cashfl ow to Group operating profi t (30%).
       Achievement of personal performance targets (10%).
The maximum bonus potential for 2010/11 under these arrangements 
is 80% of salary for the Chief Executive and 70% of salary for the Group 
Finance Director. Bonus payments are not pensionable.
Profi t Incentive Bonus Scheme (PIBS)
The Profi t Incentive Bonus Scheme was introduced in 2009 as a short-term 
measure to focus the attention of senior managers on the immediate 
objective of improving the Company's profi tability. Performance is 
measured quarterly against a Group budgeted profi t fi gure. When this is 
equalled or exceeded, participants receive $5,000. The maximum annual 
bonus amount is $20,000. In 2010 the Remuneration Committee approved 
the continuation of the scheme for senior managers, but not for the 
eight members of the Group Executive team, which includes the Chief 
Executive and the Group Finance Director. The scheme was cancelled for 
the 2010/11 fi nancial year.
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The Remuneration Committee introduced this Plan with shareholder 
approval at the AGM in 2002 and in 2010 shareholders approved a 
replacement. The existing Plan therefore came into eff ect from 2 March 
2010, with the aim of motivating Executive Directors and other senior 
executives to achieve performance superior to the Company's peers 
and to deliver sustainable improvement in shareholder returns. This is 
refl ected in the Plan's performance condition which takes the total return 
received by the Company's shareholders in terms of share price growth 
and dividends (total shareholder return or 'TSR') over a period of time and 
compares it with the total returns received by shareholders in companies 
within a pre determined and appropriate comparator group. 
Under the Plan, Executive Directors and a limited number of other senior 
executives receive conditional share awards (which may be in the form of 
nil-cost options) in respect of the Company's shares. The actual number 
of shares that each participant receives depends on the Company's TSR 
performance over a three-year period compared to the TSR performance 
within a comparator group comprising the FTSE Small Cap index, 
excluding investment trusts. Over a three year period:
       If the Company's TSR performance is below the median TSR of the 
comparator group, no shares will vest.
       If the Company's TSR performance is equal to the median TSR of the 
comparator group, 40% of the shares may vest.
       If the Company's TSR performance is equal to, or exceeds, the upper 
quartile TSR of the comparator group, 100% of the shares may vest.
       If the Company's TSR performance is between the median and 
upper quartile TSR of the comparator group, shares may vest on a 
pro-rata basis.
The above schedule refl ects the Remuneration Committee's intention 
to reward only TSR performance which outperforms the comparator 
group and the same measures are used for the 2010 Plan. In addition, 
the Committee may reduce the number of shares which will vest 
or decide that no shares will vest if it considers that the fi nancial 
performance of the Company or the performance of the participant 
does not justify vesting. 
The maximum value that can be granted under the Plan in any year is 
100% of salary. It is the Remuneration Committee's current intention 
that, as before, only the Chief Executive should receive the maximum 
conditional grant, with the Group Finance Director receiving 80% 
of salary. 
As announced to shareholders in January 2009, the 2008/9 conditional 
awards were made following the surrender of 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 
awards totalling 386,801 shares previously granted under the Plan. At the 
time the Committee confi rmed that it believed the surrender and grant 
aligned Executive Director and other recipients' interests with those of 
shareholders and the Committee remains of this view. As announced 
to shareholders in March 2010, following approval of the 2010 Plan at 
the annual general meeting on 2 March 2010, joint ownership awards, 
nil cost options and conditional awards of shares were granted under 
the 2010 Plan to the Executive Directors and members of the Group 
executive team 
The Committee determined in October 2010 that the 2007/8 award, of 
which a limited number of awards were still outstanding in the hands of 
two ex-employees, did not vest.

Performance graph
The following graph illustrates the total return, in terms of share price 
growth and dividends on a notional investment of  100 in the Company 
over the last fi ve years relative to the FTSE Small Cap Index (excluding 
investment trusts). This index was chosen by the Remuneration 
Committee as a competitive indicator of general UK market performance 
for companies of a similar size. 
Shareholding guidelines
Under shareholding guidelines approved in 2004, executives 
participating in the Performance Share Plan during the year are required 
to build up and retain a shareholding in the Company. For Executive 
Directors the shareholding requirement is equivalent to 1.5 times 
base salary and for other executives the shareholding requirement is 
equivalent to 1.0 times base salary. The Executive Directors and senior 
executives are required to retain a portion of any awards that vest under 
the Performance Share Plan until their respective shareholding guideline 
is met.

Dilution
The Company reviews the awards of shares made under the various 
all-employee and executive share plans in terms of their eff ect on 
dilution limits. In respect of the 5% and 10% limits recommended by the 
Association of British Insurers, the relevant percentages were 5.81% and 
7.94% respectively based on the issued share capital at 30 September 
2010. Under the 2010 Plan the 5% limit was increased to 10%. It has been 
the Company's practice to use an Employee Share Ownership Trust in 
order to meet its liability for shares awarded under the Performance 
Share Plan. In March 2010 a second Employee Share Ownership Trust was 
established in connection with the new jointly owned equity awards. 
At 30 September 2010 there were 2,437,681 shares held in the two 
Employee Share Ownership Trusts which will either be used to satisfy 
awards granted under the Plan to date, or in connection with awards 
to be made under the 2010 Plan. A Hedging Committee ensures that 
the Employee Share Ownership Trusts hold suffi  cient shares to satisfy 
existing and any future awards made under the Plan by buying shares 
in the market or causing the Company to issue new shares. During 
September 2010 the Avon Rubber plc Employee Share Ownership Trust 
No. 1 purchased 175,000 shares in the market and received a further 
1,582,611 shares by way of an issue of new shares. As at 30 September 
2010 the two Employee Share Ownership Trusts held a total of 2,437,681 
shares, 563,390 on a jointly owned equity basis.
Pensions and other benefi ts
The current Executive Directors (Mr. P.C. Slabbert and Mr. A.G. Lewis) are 
both based in the UK and are members of the Avon Rubber Retirement 
and Death Benefi ts Plan. Until 30 September 2009, when the fi nal salary 
section of the Plan closed to future accrual of benefi ts, Mr. Slabbert was a 
member of the Senior Executive Section which provided members with 
a defi ned level of benefi t on retirement depending on length of service 
and earnings. Members can receive a pension of up to two-thirds of 
pensionable salary on retirement from age 60, provided the minimum 
service requirement of 20 years has been met. On death in service, a 
lump sum of four times pensionable salary is paid, along with a spouses' 
pension of one half of the member's prospective pension. When an 
Executive Director dies after retirement, a spouse's pension of one half 
of the member's pension is paid. For the year to 30 September 2010 Mr. 
Slabbert has been a member of the money purchase section of the Plan.
In line with Company policy which dates back to 2003  for new 
employees in the UK, any UK-based Executive Directors joining the 
Company are off ered defi ned contribution arrangements.
Mr. Lewis is therefore a member of the money purchase section of the 
Plan. Members receive a pension based upon the size of their retirement 
account on retirement from age 65. On death in service, a lump sum of 
four times pensionable salary is paid, along with a spouses' pension of 
one quarter of the member's pensionable salary. Both Mr Slabbert and 
Mr Lewis receive a company pension contribution of 15% of salary.
Executive Directors' basic salaries are the only pensionable element 
of their remuneration packages. Executive Directors are entitled to 
participate in employee healthcare plans and to receive a car allowance 
and related expenses. 
Neither of the Executive Directors is currently appointed as a non-
executive director of any limited company outside the Group. The 
Remuneration Committee will establish a policy on the treatment of any 
fees received by Executive Directors in respect of such non-executive 
roles when required.
Contracts
The Company's policy is that Executive Directors should normally be 
employed on a contract which may be terminated either by the Company 
or the Executive Director giving 12 months notice and which otherwise 
expires on retirement, currently at age 60 for Mr. Slabbert and age 65 
for Mr. Lewis. The Company may terminate the contract early without 
cause by making a payment in lieu of notice by monthly instalments of 
salary and benefi ts to a maximum of 12 months, with reductions for any 
amounts received from providing services to others during this period. 
The Remuneration Committee may vary these terms if the particular 
circumstances surrounding the appointment of a new Executive 
Director demand it. The Remuneration Committee strongly endorses 
the obligation on an Executive Director to mitigate any loss on early 
termination and will seek to reduce the amount payable on termination 
where it is appropriate to do so. The Committee will also take care to 
ensure that, while meeting its contractual obligations, poor performance 
is not rewarded. The Executive Directors' contracts contain early 
termination provisions consistent with the policy outlined above.
The table below summarises key details in respect of each Executive 
Director's contract.

CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors receive a fi xed fee for their 
services. Fee levels are determined by the Board in light of market 
research and advice provided by Hanson Green, which also provides 
services in connection with the proposed recruitment of new Non-
Executive Directors. Fee levels are reviewed from time to time. The 
Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any 
Board discussions or vote on their own remuneration, nor do they 
participate in any incentive or benefi t plans. 
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors each have a letter of 
appointment which specifi es an initial period of appointment. The initial 
period for Mrs. Pirie was three years and this was extended for a further 
three years on 1 March 2008. Sir Richard Needham's initial period of three 
years expired on 26 January 2010 and was extended on a rolling annual 
basis. The initial period for Mr. Evans was also three years and this was 
extended on a rolling annual basis on 31 May 2010. 
Chairman and Non-Executive Director appointments are subject to Board 
approval and election by shareholders at the annual general meeting 
following appointment and, thereafter, re-election by rotation every 
three years. The Chairman and any Non-Executive Director who has 
served for more than nine years since fi rst election are subject to annual 
re-election by shareholders. There are no provisions for compensation 
payments on early termination in the Chairman's and the Non-Executive 
Directors' letters of appointment. The date of each appointment is set 
out below, together with the date of their last re-election.

The following information has been audited by the Company's auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as required by the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008.
Executive Directors' pensions
The Stock Exchange Listing Rules require the disclosure of certain additional information relating to the pensions of Executive Directors under defi ned 
benefi t schemes. The information is set out below.
The age at which Mr. P.C. Slabbert may take his pension unreduced has been reduced by 5/8ths of a year over the year to 30 September 2010.
On closure of the defi ned benefi t scheme Mr. Slabbert joined the money purchase section of the plan. Company contributions in respect of Mr. Slabbert 
during the year were  33,000, of which  5,500 were to the money purchase section of the plan and  27,500 to personal pension arrangements.
In respect of Mr. A.G. Lewis, company contributions to the money purchase section of the plan were  21,713.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider 
on transferring the scheme's liability in respect of Directors' pension benefi ts. They do not represent sums payable to individual Directors and, therefore, 
cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The accrued entitlement shown is the amount that would be paid each year at normal retirement age, based on service to the end of the current year. 
The accrued lump sum, under the defi ned benefi t scheme, for Mr Slabbert at 30 September 2010 was  281,400 (2009:  281,400).
