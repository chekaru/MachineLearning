PART 1. REMUNERATION POLICIES (NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT)
Remuneration Report
for the year ended 30 September 2011
Part 1 of this Report sets out the Company's remuneration policies for the Directors for the year ended 30 September 2011. These policies are likely to 
continue to apply in future years, unless there are specifi c reasons for change, in which case shareholders will be informed appropriately. Part 2 sets out 
audited details of the remuneration received by Directors during the year ended 30 September 2011.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
T 
he Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors and for 
determining their individual packages and terms of service. In establishing this policy, and to ensure consistency with 
the arrangements for other management levels, the Remuneration Committee has regard to pay and conditions 
throughout the Group and is also responsible for setting the remuneration packages of the Group executive management team. 
The Committee's terms of reference are available on the Company's website. 
The Committee met four times during the year. The composition of the 
Committee has remained unchanged during the year and comprises 
Mr. D.R. Evans (Chairman), Sir Richard Needham and Mrs. S.J. Pirie. 
The Chief Executive, Mr. P.C. Slabbert and the Company Secretary, 
Mr. M. Ingrey-Counter, are invited to attend meetings except when 
matters relating to their own remuneration arrangements are 
discussed.  The Group Finance Director, Mr A.G. Lewis attended two 
meetings by invitation during the year. The Committee also uses 
external independent professional advisers when needed. KPMG is 
the Company's independent actuarial advisor on pension matters and 
will provide the Committee with information on executive pension 
arrangements when required. Ernst & Young LLP provide performance 
monitoring data for review by the Committee in relation to the 
Performance Share Plan.
GUIDING POLICY 
The Remuneration Committee's aim is to ensure that the structure of 
executive remuneration supports the achievement of the Company's 
performance objectives and, in turn, increases shareholder value. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews executive remuneration 
arrangements regularly to ensure that they remain eff ective, 
competitive and appropriate to the Group's circumstances and 
prospects, and monitors incentive award levels and consequent 
Company liabilities. 
The Company's guiding policy on executive remuneration is that: 
  executive remuneration packages should take into account the 
 linkage between pay and performance by both rewarding eff ective 
 management and by making the enhancement of shareholder value 
 a critical success factor in the setting of incentives, both in the 
 short and the long term; and 
  the overall level of salary, incentives, pension and other benefi ts 
 should be competitive when compared with other companies of a 
 similar size and global spread.
REMUNERATION ELEMENTS 
Executive remuneration comprises four elements: annual salary, 
short-term bonus, longer-term performance shares and other 
benefi ts (including pension). In line with the Company's emphasis 
on performance-related pay, bonus payments are dependent on the 
Company's annual fi nancial performance, and, to a small degree the 
executive's personal performance against a set of personal performance 
targets, while the receipt of performance shares is dependent on 
enhanced relative returns to shareholders over a three-year period. 
The following table illustrates the proportion of variable pay to base 
salary for the Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director for 
2011/12, assuming target or maximum performance related pay.

SALARY
In setting salary levels, the Remuneration Committee considers 
the experience and responsibility of executives and their personal 
performance during the previous year. The Committee also takes account 
of salary levels within other companies of a similar size and global spread, 
as well as the rates of increases for other employees within the Company. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews salaries with eff ect from October 
each year. 
The annual base salary as at 30 September 2011 for Mr. P.C.Slabbert is 
 235,000 and for Mr. A.G.Lewis is  162,000.
ANNUAL BONUS
The executives' annual bonus arrangements are focused on the 
achievement of the Company's short-term fi nancial objectives. 
Before the start of each year, the Remuneration Committee sets 
fi nancial performance targets for the year. These are designed to be 
stretching and for the bonus for 2011/12 will be based on the following:
The maximum bonus potential for 2011/12 under these arrangements is 
100% of salary for the Chief Executive and 80% of salary for the Group 
Finance Director. Bonus payments are not pensionable. 
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN (PSP)
The Remuneration Committee introduced this Plan with shareholder 
approval at the AGM in 2002 and in 2010 shareholders approved a 
replacement. The existing Plan therefore came into eff ect from 2 March 
2010, with the aim of motivating Executive Directors and other senior 
executives to achieve performance superior to the Company's peers and to 
deliver sustainable improvement in shareholder returns. This is refl ected in 
the Plan's performance condition which takes the total return received by 
the Company's shareholders in terms of share price growth and dividends 
(total shareholder return or 'TSR') over a period of time and compares 
it with the total returns received by shareholders in companies within a 
predetermined and appropriate comparator group. 
Under the Plan, Executive Directors and a limited number of other senior 
executives receive conditional share awards (which may be in the form of 
joint ownership awards, nil-cost options or conditional awards) in respect 
of the Company's shares. The actual number of shares that each participant 
receives depends on the Company's TSR performance over a three-year 
period compared to the TSR performance within a comparator group 
comprising the FTSE Small Cap index, excluding investment trusts. Over a 
three year period: 
  If the Company's TSR performance is below the median TSR of 
 the comparator group, no shares will vest. 
  If the Company's TSR performance is equal to the median TSR of 
 the comparator group, 40% of the shares may vest. 
  If the Company's TSR performance is equal to, or exceeds, the upper  
 quartile TSR of the comparator group, 100% of the shares may vest. 
  If the Company's TSR performance is between the median and 
 upper quartile TSR of the comparator group, shares may vest on a 
 pro-rata basis. 
The above schedule refl ects the Remuneration Committee's intention 
to reward only TSR performance which outperforms the comparator 
group and the same measures are used for the 2010 Plan. In addition, the 
Committee may reduce the number of shares which will vest or decide 
that no shares will vest if it considers that the fi nancial performance of the 
Company or the performance of the participant does not justify vesting. 
In September 2011 the Remuneration Committee agreed two changes to 
the Plan's performance condition for future awards. First, the percentage 
volume of shares that vests if the Company's TSR performance is equal to 
the median TSR of the comparator group was reduced from 40% to 30%. 
Second, the performance condition was changed to a two fold test based 
on TSR performance and Earnings Per Share ('EPS'), bringing future awards 
in line with market practice and thereby encouraging management to 
maintain and increase earnings levels whilst at the same time ensuring that 
it is not at the expense of longer term shareholder return. 
The precise terms of the combined EPS/TSR target is that awards will 
be split so that 50% vests in accordance with the TSR target and 50% in 
accordance with the EPS target. The TSR target will remain as it is currently 
(with the above change so that 30% vests at median performance). The EPS 
target would be based on real growth in earnings over the performance 
period where real growth is expressed as a percentage above infl ation. 
PIRC UK Shareholder Voting Guidelines 2011 state that the minimum 
acceptable EPS target would be 3% a year above infl ation, but that 
institutional shareholders generally expect the EPS target to be linked to 
current broker forecasts of EPS growth with vesting occurring if actual 
growth exceeded those forecasts. The Committee therefore set the EPS 
target as nil vesting at RPI +3% and maximum vesting at RPI +8%.
The maximum value that can be granted under the Plan in any year is 
100% of salary. It is the Remuneration Committee's current intention 
that, as before, only the Chief Executive should receive the maximum 
conditional grant, with the Group Finance Director receiving 80% of salary.

Remuneration Report continued
for the year ended 30 September 2011
As announced to shareholders in December 2010 joint ownership 
awards, nil cost options and conditional awards of shares were granted 
under the 2010 Plan to the Executive Directors and members of the 
group executive team.
The Committee determined in October 2010 that the 2007/8 award, of 
which a limited number of awards were still outstanding in the hands of 
two ex-employees, did not vest.
PERFORMANCE GRAPH
The following two graphs illustrate the total return, in terms of share 
price growth and dividends on a notional investment of  100 in the 
Company over the last three and fi ve years relative to the FTSE Small 
Cap Index (excluding investment trusts). This index was chosen by the 
Remuneration Committee as a competitive indicator of general UK 
market performance for companies of a similar size.
SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES
Under shareholding guidelines approved in 2004, executives 
participating in the Performance Share Plan during the year are required 
to build up and retain a shareholding in the Company. For Executive 
Directors the shareholding requirement is equivalent to 1.5 times 
base salary and for other executives the shareholding requirement is 
equivalent to 1.0 times base salary. The Executive Directors and senior 
executives are required to retain a portion of any awards that vest 
under the Performance Share Plan until their respective shareholding 
guideline is met. 
In September 2011 the Remuneration Committee amended the 
shareholding guidelines so that the Executive Directors are obliged 
to build up and retain a shareholding equivalent to 2 times base salary.

DILUTION
The Company reviews the awards of shares made under the various 
all-employee and executive share plans in terms of their eff ect on 
dilution limits. In respect of the 5% and 10% limits recommended by the 
Association of British Insurers, the relevant percentages were 7.16% and 
9.27% respectively based on the issued share capital at 30 September 
2011. Under the 2010 Plan the 5% limit was increased to 10%.  It has been 
the Company's practice to use an Employee Share Ownership Trust in 
order to meet its liability for shares awarded under the Performance 
Share Plan. In March 2010 a second Employee Share Ownership Trust 
was established in connection with the new jointly owned equity 
awards. At 30 September 2011 there were 2,537,681 shares held in the 
two Employee Share Ownership Trusts which will either be used to 
satisfy awards granted under the Plans to date, or in connection with 
awards to be made under the 2010 Plan. A Hedging Committee ensures 
that the Employee Share Ownership Trusts hold suffi  cient shares to 
satisfy existing and future awards made under the Plan by buying shares 
in the market or causing the Company to issue new shares.  In August 
2011 the Avon Rubber p.l.c. Employee Share Ownership Trust No. 1 
purchased 100,000 shares in the market.  As at 30 September 2011 the 
two Employee Share Owneship Trusts held a total of 2,537,681 shares, 
899,070 on a jointly owned equity basis.
PENSIONS AND OTHER BENEFITS
The current Executive Directors (Mr. P.C. Slabbert and Mr. A.G. Lewis) are 
both based in the UK and are members of the Avon Rubber Retirement 
and Death Benefi ts Plan. Until 30 September 2009, when the fi nal salary 
section of the Plan closed to future accrual of benefi ts, Mr. Slabbert was 
a member of the Senior Executive Section which provided members 
with a defi ned level of benefi t on retirement depending on length of 
service and earnings. Members can receive a pension of up to two-thirds 
of pensionable salary on retirement from age 60, provided the minimum 
service requirement of 20 years has been met. On death in service, a 
lump sum of four times pensionable salary is paid, along with a spouse's 
pension of one half of the member's prospective pension. When an 
Executive Director dies after retirement, a spouse's pension of one half 
of the member's pension is paid. For the years to 30 September 2010 
and 30 September 2011 Mr. Slabbert has been a member of the money 
purchase section of the Plan (see below).
In line with Company policy which dates back to 2003 for new 
employees in the UK, any UK-based Executive Directors joining the 
Company are off ered defi ned contribution arrangements.
Mr. Lewis is therefore a member of the money purchase section of the 
Plan. Members receive a pension based upon the size of their retirement 
account on retirement from age 65. On death in service, a lump sum of 
four times pensionable salary is paid, along with a spouses' pension of 
one quarter of the member's pensionable salary. Both Mr Slabbert and 
Mr Lewis receive a company pension contribution of 15% of salary.
Executive Directors' basic salaries are the only pensionable element 
of their remuneration packages. Executive Directors are entitled to 
participate in employee healthcare plans. 
Neither of the Executive Directors is currently appointed as a 
non-executive director of any limited company outside the Group. 
The Remuneration Committee will establish a policy on the treatment 
of any fees received by Executive Directors in respect of such 
non-executive roles when required.
CONTRACTS
The Company's policy is that Executive Directors should normally 
be employed on a contract which may be terminated either by the 
Company or the Executive Director giving 12 months notice and which 
otherwise expires on retirement, currently at age 60 for Mr. Slabbert 
and age 65 for Mr. Lewis. The Company may terminate the contract 
early without cause by making a payment in lieu of notice by monthly 
instalments of salary and benefi ts to a maximum of 12 months, with 
reductions for any amounts received from providing services to others 
during this period. 
The Remuneration Committee may vary these terms if the particular 
circumstances surrounding the appointment of a new Executive 
Director demand it. The Remuneration Committee strongly endorses 
the obligation on an Executive Director to mitigate any loss on early 
termination and will seek to reduce the amount payable on termination 
where it is appropriate to do so. The Committee will also take care 
to ensure that, while meeting its contractual obligations, poor 
performance is not rewarded. The Executive Directors' contracts contain 
early termination provisions consistent with the policy outlined above.
The table below summarises key details in respect of each Executive 
Director's contract.

CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors receive a fi xed fee for their 
services. Fee levels are determined by the Board in light of market 
research and advice provided by Ernst & Young LLP. Fee levels are 
reviewed from time to time. The Chairman and the Non-Executive 
Directors do not participate in any Board discussions or vote on 
their own remuneration, nor do they participate in any incentive or 
benefi t plans. 
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors each have a letter of 
appointment which specifi es an initial period of appointment. The initial 
period for Mrs. Pirie was three years and this was extended for a further 
three years on 1 March 2008 and on a rolling annual basis on 1 March 
2011. Sir Richard Needham's initial period of three years expired on 26 
January 2010 and was extended on a rolling annual basis. The initial 
period for Mr. Evans was also three years and this was extended on a 
rolling annual basis on 31 May 2010. 
Chairman and Non-Executive Director appointments are subject to 
Board approval and election by shareholders at the annual general 
meeting following appointment and, thereafter, re-election by rotation 
every three years. The Chairman and any Non-Executive Director who 
has served for more than nine years since fi rst election are subject 
to annual re-election by shareholders. There are no provisions for 
compensation payments on early termination in the Chairman's and 
the Non-Executive Directors' letters of appointment. The date of each 
appointment is set out below, together with the date of their last 
re-election.

PART 2. DETAILS OF REMUNERATION (AUDITABLE INFORMATION)
The following information has been audited by the Company's auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as required by the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008.
Executive Directors' pensions
The Stock Exchange Listing Rules require the disclosure of certain additional information relating to the pensions of Executive Directors under defi ned 
benefi t schemes. The information is set out below.
The age at which Mr. P.C. Slabbert may take his pension unreduced was reduced by 5/8ths of a year over the year to 30 September 2011.
On closure of the defi ned benefi t scheme Mr. Slabbert joined the money purchase section of the Plan. Company contributions in respect of Mr. Slabbert 
during the year were  35,300 (2010:  33,000), of which  5,900 (2010:  5,500) were to the money purchase section of the Plan.
In respect of Mr. A.G. Lewis, company contributions to the money purchase section of the Plan were  24,300 (2010:  21,700).
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider 
on transferring the scheme's liability in respect of Director's pension benefi ts. They do not represent sums payable to individual Directors and, therefore, 
cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The accrued entitlement shown is the amount that would be paid each year at normal retirement age, based on service to the end of the current year. 
The accrued lump sum, under the defi ned benefi t scheme, for Mr Slabbert at 30 September 2011 was  292,400 (2010:  281,400).

Performance Share Plan 2002 and 2010 (the 2002 Scheme and the 2010 Scheme)
For grants of options or conditional awards made to date pursuant to the 2002 Scheme, and grants of joint ownership awards, options or conditional awards 
made to date pursuant to the 2010 Scheme, the performance conditions have been based on the Company's TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group, 
comprising the FTSE Small Cap companies (excluding investment trusts).
In September 2011 the Remuneration Committee agreed two changes to the Plan's performance condition for future awards. First, the percentage of shares 
that vest if the Company's TSR performance is equal to the median TSR of the comparator group was reduced from 40% to 30%. Second, the performance 
condition was changed to a two fold test based on TSR performance and Earnings Per Share (EPS), bringing future awards in line with market practice and 
thereby encouraging management to maintain and increase earnings levels whilst at the same time ensuring that it is not at the expense of longer term 
shareholder return. 
The precise terms of the combined EPS/TSR target is that awards will be split so that 50% vests in accordance with the TSR target and 50% in accordance 
with the EPS target. The TSR target will remain as it is currently (with the above change so that 30% vests at median performance). The EPS target would be 
based on real growth in earnings over the performance period where real growth is expressed as a % above infl ation. PIRC UK Shareholder Voting Guidelines 
2011 state that the minimum acceptable EPS target would be 3 per cent a year above infl ation, but that institutional shareholders generally expect the EPS 
target to be linked to current broker forecasts of EPS growth with vesting occurring if actual growth exceeded those forecasts. The Committee therefore set 
the EPS target as nil vesting at RPI +3% and maximum vesting at RPI +8%.

Sharesave option schemes
As at 30 September 2011 none of the Directors had outstanding options relating to sharesave option schemes (2010: nil). As at 30 September 2011 there were 
no outstanding options under the Avon Rubber plc Sharesave Option Scheme 2002 (the only remaining sharesave scheme) and this scheme will terminate 
on its 10 year anniversary on 4 February 2012.
As at 30 September 2011, the market price of Avon Rubber p.l.c. shares was  2.85 (2010:  1.65). During the year the highest and lowest market prices were 
 3.24 and  1.62 respectively.
The Remuneration Report has been approved by the Board of Directors and signed on its behalf by:
The weighted average remaining life of the awards outstanding at the year end is 0.8 years (2010: 1.4 years).
*As explained in last year's report the awards granted under the 2006/7 and the 2007/8 cycle did not vest.
**These awards were reduced to 69% of entitlement to remain within the 5% dilution limit previously contained in the Plan rules.
