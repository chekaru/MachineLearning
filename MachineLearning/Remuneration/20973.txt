Part 1. Remuneration policies (not subject to audit)
Part 1 of this Report sets out the Company's remuneration policies for the Directors for the year ended 30 September 2012. These policies 
are likely to continue to apply in future years, unless there are specifi c reasons for change, in which case shareholders will be informed 
appropriately. Part 2 sets out audited details of the remuneration received by Directors during the year ended 30 September 2012.
Executive Directors
T 
he Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors and for 
determining their individual packages and terms of service. In establishing this policy, and to ensure consistency with the 
arrangements for other management levels, the Remuneration Committee has regard to pay and conditions throughout the 
Group and is also responsible for setting the remuneration packages for the other members of the executive management team.
The Committee comprises Sir Richard Needham (Chairman), 
Mr D.R. Evans and Mrs S.J. Pirie. Sir Richard Needham became 
Chairman of the Committee in February 2012 when he stood 
down as Chairman of the Board and Mr D.R. Evans, the previous 
Chairman of the Committee, became Chairman of the Board. 
The Chief Executive, Mr P.C. Slabbert and the Company 
Secretary, Mr M. Ingrey-Counter, are invited to attend meetings 
except when matters relating to their own remuneration 
arrangements are discussed.  The Committee also uses external 
independent professional advisers when needed. KPMG is the 
Company's independent actuarial advisor on pension matters 
and will provide the Committee with information on executive 
pension arrangements when required. Ernst & Young provide 
performance monitoring data for review by the Committee in 
relation to the Performance Share Plan. In September 2011 Ernst 
& Young also conducted a benchmarking review of the reward 
packages received by the executive management team and the 
fees received by the Chairman and the other Non-Executive 
Directors.    
The Committee met 5 times during the year and addressed the 
following main issues:
  approval of the Executive Directors' annual 
 bonus payments
  approval of the annual bonus plan for the 
 Executive Directors for the coming year
  reviewed and confi rmed the vesting of the 
 2008/9 Performance Share Plan award
  reviewed and approved the 2011/12 Performance   
 Share Plan awards and monitored the performance of the  
 outstanding awards against their performance targets
  reviewed the executive management team's succession   
 and talent management plan
  reviewed the remuneration of the Executive Directors,   
 the Chairman and the other members of the executive   
 management team
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee's terms of reference are 
available on the Company's website and include:
  determining and agreeing with the Board the policy  
 for the remuneration of the Company's Chief Executive,   
 Group Finance Director, Chairman, the Company 
 Secretary and such other members of the senior   
 management team as it chooses to consider or is   
 designated to consider;
  within the terms of the agreed policy, determining 
 the total individual remuneration package of each   
 Executive Director including, where appropriate, 
 bonuses, incentive payments, share options and pension   
 arrangements. The remuneration of Non-Executive   
 Directors is a matter for the Chairman and the 
 Executive Directors;

  reviewing the design of all share incentive plans 
 for approval by the Board and shareholders. For any 
 discretionary plans, determining each year whether   
 awards will be made, the overall amount of such awards,   
 the individual awards to Executive Directors and the   
 executive management team and the performance   
 targets to be used; 
  determining the targets for any performance-related   
 bonus schemes operated by the Company;
  reviewing the remuneration trends across the Group,   
 including the salary increases proposed annually for all   
 Group employees; 
  agreeing termination arrangements for senior executives.
The Committee's aim is to ensure that the structure of executive 
remuneration supports the achievement of the Company's 
performance objectives and, in turn, increases shareholder 
value. The Company's guiding policy on executive remuneration 
is that: 
  executive remuneration packages should take into   
 account the linkage between pay and performance by   
 both rewarding eff ective management and by making   
 the enhancement of shareholder value a critical success   
 factor in the setting of incentives, both in the short and   
 the long term; and 
  the overall level of salary, incentives, pension and other   
 benefi ts should be competitive when compared with   
 other companies of a similar size and global spread.

According to the report the Chief Executive and Group Finance 
Director roles attracted salaries below the minimum pay range 
found in the comparator group. Based upon the report, the 
signifi cant growth delivered in recent years and the future 
prospects for growth, the Committee agreed a strategy to target 
the median pay level, but not in a single large increase. The fi rst 
step towards the median was taken with eff ect from 1 October 
2011 when Mr P.C. Slabbert's salary was increased from  235,000 
to  280,000 (a 19.1% increase) and Mr A.G. Lewis's salary was 
increased from  162,000 to  200,000 (a 23.5% increase). 
In September 2012 the Committee  considered whether to grant 
a further increase towards the median level for Mr Slabbert and 
Mr Lewis but decided against this. No general salary increase 
was made either and the Committee will review the position 
again in September 2013.
Salary 
In setting salary levels, the Remuneration Committee considers 
the experience and responsibility of executives and their 
personal performance during the previous year. The Committee 
also takes account of salary levels within other companies of a 
similar size and global spread, as well as the rates of increases 
for other employees within the Group. The Remuneration 
Committee reviews salaries with eff ect from October each year. 
In September 2011 Ernst & Young were instructed by the 
Committee to conduct a benchmarking review of the reward 
packages received by the executive management team.
The report benchmarked these by reference to a comparator 
group of 18 UK listed companies selected according to size, 
industry sector or location as a suitable benchmark group for 
the Company. 
The following table illustrates the proportion of variable pay 
to base salary for the Chief Executive and the Group Finance 
Director for 2012/13, assuming target (which is median

Annual bonus 
The executives' annual bonus arrangements are focused on the achievement of the Company's short-term fi nancial objectives. Before 
the start of each year, the Remuneration Committee sets fi nancial performance targets for the year, which are  designed to be stretching. 
For 2012/13 80% of Mr P.C. Slabbert's bonus potential of 100% of salary will be based on the achievement of Group fi nancial targets and 
the remaining 20% will be based on achieving measurable personal performance targets, as shown below. 70% of Mr A.G. Lewis's bonus 
potential of 80% of salary will be based on the achievement of Group fi nancial targets and the remaining 10% will be based on achieving 
measurable personal performance targets, also as shown below: 
1.  Financial Targets
(a) Group profi t budget achievement (Group PBITE)
(b) Profi t growth on previous year (year on year PBITE growth)
(c) Group cash generation (ratio of operating cashfl ow to operating profi t)
2.  Personal Performance Target Rating
A portion of bonus can be earned based on an individual reviewer's 
assessment of personal performance against personal performance 
targets set at the beginning of the fi nancial year.

shares that each participant receives depends on the Company's  
performance over a three-year performance period against the 
combined  EPS/TSR target. The Committee believes that a three-
year performance period remains appropriate for the Company 
and is in line with market practice amongst the FTSE Small Cap 
community.
For the TSR measure, the performance of the Company's 
shares over the performance period is compared to the TSR 
performance within a comparator group comprising the FTSE 
Small Cap index, excluding investment trusts. The Committee 
has considered whether to create a bespoke comparator group 
but concluded that there are insuffi  cient direct comparator 
companies of the right size and in the relevant industries to 
warrant a specifi c peer group and the FTSE Small Cap Index 
remains an appropriate comparator group. Over the three year 
period: 
  if the Company's TSR performance is below the median 
 TSR of the comparator group, no shares will vest. 
  if the Company's TSR performance is equal to the median 
 TSR of the comparator group, 30% of the shares may vest. 
  if the Company's TSR performance is equal to, or exceeds, 
 the upper quartile TSR of the comparator group, 100% of 
 the shares may vest. 
  if the Company's TSR performance is between the median  
 and upper quartile TSR of the comparator group, shares may  
 vest on a pro-rata basis. 
The above schedule refl ects the Remuneration Committee's 
intention to reward only TSR performance which outperforms 
the comparator group and the Committee's view is that 
measuring this by reference to median and upper quartile 
placing remains appropriate. Last year the Committee reduced 
the minimum TSR vesting target from 40% to 30% to make it 
more challenging. While the Committee has noted that market 
practice is moving towards a 25% minimum vesting level it has 
decided not to implement a further reduction this year, but this 
will be kept under review.
The 2011 Ernst & Young benchmarking review found that 
the annual bonus percentages for Mr Slabbert (80%) and Mr 
Lewis (70%) were below the median. In September 2011 the 
Committee therefore agreed that the annual bonus for the 
fi nancial year commencing 1 October 2011 would be increased 
to 100% of salary for Mr Slabbert and 80% of salary for Mr Lewis 
and this is the maximum bonus potential for 2012/13 under 
these arrangements. Bonus payments are not pensionable. 
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The Remuneration Committee introduced this Plan with 
shareholder approval at the annual general meeting in 2002 and 
in 2010 shareholders approved a replacement. The existing Plan 
therefore came into eff ect from 2 March 2010, with the aim of 
motivating Executive Directors and other senior executives to 
achieve performance superior to the Company's peers and to 
maintain and increase earnings levels whilst at the same time 
ensuring that it is not at the expense of longer term shareholder 
returns . This is refl ected in the Plan's performance conditions 
which are based on total shareholder return (TSR) and earnings 
per share (EPS). The Committee believes that these fi nancial 
performance conditions remain appropriate for a growing 
business and the expectations of shareholders over the next 
three years. Non-fi nancial performance conditions have been 
considered but are not appropriate at the current stage in the 
development of the Group.
The TSR measure takes the total return received by the 
Company's shareholders in terms of share price growth and 
dividends over a period of time and compares it with the total 
returns received by shareholders in companies within a 
pre-determined and appropriate comparator group. 
The EPS measure is based on real growth in earnings over the 
performance period where real growth is expressed as a % 
above infl ation.
Under the Plan, Executive Directors and a limited number of 
other senior executives and employees receive conditional 
share awards (which may be in the form of nil-cost options) 
in respect of the Company's shares. The awards are split so 
that 50% vests in accordance with the TSR target and 50% in 
accordance with the EPS target. The Committee considered 
whether to make the targets apply concurrently but decided 
against this, preferring a balance of measures relating to 
earnings growth and long term strategic performance that are 
assessed independently of each other.  The actual number of

OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR HOW WE RUN OUR BUSINESS HOW WE PERFORMED SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
The maximum value that can be granted under the Plan rules  in 
any year is 100% of salary. It is the Remuneration Committee's 
intention that only the Chief Executive should receive the 
maximum conditional grant, with the Group Finance Director 
receiving 80% of salary.  These levels were reviewed and 
validated in September 2011 by the Committee by reference to 
the Ernst & Young benchmarking review.
On a change of control, any vesting of awards will be pro-rated 
by reference to time and performance. 
Under the Plan as introduced in 2010 joint ownership awards 
were permitted for the fi rst time. In the Company's case, savings 
in National Insurance Contributions resulting from this are 
not off set by the loss of corporation tax credits because of the 
presence of historic tax losses in the UK. 
As announced to shareholders in December 2011, joint 
ownership awards, nil cost options and conditional awards 
of shares were granted under the 2010 Plan to the Executive 
Directors and members of the Group Executive team.  
The Committee determined in December 2011 that the 
2008/9 award vested in full on the basis that the TSR over the 
three years from 1 October 2008 to 30 September 2011 was 
signifi cantly ahead of the upper quartile of the comparator 
group. As a consequence, and as announced to shareholders in 
December 2011, 460,714 shares were awarded to Mr Slabbert 
and 222,857 shares were awarded to Mr Lewis.

For the EPS measure, the earnings per share over the 
performance period are compared to a scale which allows 
for nil vesting at RPI +3% and maximum vesting at RPI +8%, 
with vesting on a pro rata basis for performance between 
these two fi gures. This range was fi rst introduced for the 
awards made in December 2011 and the Committee believes 
it remains appropriate. It is diffi  cult to link the EPS target to 
broker forecasts which only look out one year, but if infl ation is 
assumed at 3%, then under the EPS measure the Group has to 
grow profi ts by 20% over 3 years to achieve minimum vesting 
and by 35% to achieve maximum vesting. These measures are 
ahead of expectations for businesses in the Company's sector 
where longer term forecasts are published.
In addition, the Committee may reduce the number of shares 
which will vest or decide that no shares will vest if it considers 
that the fi nancial performance of the Company or the 
performance of the participant does not justify vesting. Avon Rubber p.l.c.  Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Shareholding guidelines
Under shareholding guidelines approved in 2004, executives 
participating in the Performance Share Plan during the year are 
required to build up and retain a shareholding in the Company. 
For Executive Directors the shareholding requirement is 
equivalent to 1.5 times base salary and for other executives the 
shareholding requirement is equivalent to 1.0 times base salary. 
The Executive Directors and senior executives are required to 
retain a portion of any awards that vest under the Performance 
Share Plan until their respective shareholding guideline is met. 
In September 2011 the Remuneration Committee amended the 
shareholding guidelines so that for future awards the Executive 
Directors are obliged to build up and retain a shareholding 
equivalent to two times base salary, after which they are not 
required to retain any portion of future awards that vest.
Dilution
The Company reviews the awards of shares made under the 
various all-employee and executive share plans in terms of their 
eff ect on dilution limits in any rolling 10-year period. In respect 
of the 5% and 10% limits recommended by the Association of 
British Insurers, the relevant percentages were 7.67% and 9.78% 
respectively based on the issued share capital at 30 September 
2012. Under the 2010 Plan the 5% limit was increased to 10% 
and, last year, the 10% limit was increased to 15% to preserve 
the 10% limit for discretionary plans in connection with the 
introduction of the all employee Share Incentive Plan. 
As at 30 September 2012 , the number of shares committed 
under discretionary  share-based incentive schemes since 30 
September 2002 was 3,417,597. Deducting the shares purchased 
in the market to satisfy previous awards that had vested and 
the shares held in the  Employee Share Ownership Trusts gives 
2,355,193 shares which represents 7.67% dilution against the 
10% discretionary plan dilution limit. As at 30 September 
2012 , the number of shares committed under all employee  
share-based incentive schemes since 30 September 2002 was 
4,068,143. Deducting the shares purchased in the market to 
satisfy previous awards that had vested and the shares held in 
the Employee Share Ownership Trusts gives 3,005,739 shares 
which represents 9.78% dilution against the 15% all employee 
plan dilution limit.
It remains the Company's practice to use Employee Share 
Ownership Trusts in order to meet its liability for shares awarded 
under the Performance Share Plan. Two trusts have been 
established, the second in March 2010 in connection with the 
new jointly owned equity awards. In September 2012 the Avon 
Rubber plc Employee Share Ownership Trust No. 1 purchased 
90,000 shares in the market. At 30 September 2012 there were 
1,400,642 shares held in the two Employee Share Ownership 
Trusts which will either be used to satisfy awards granted under 
the Plan to date, or in connection with awards to be made under 
the 2010 Plan. Of these, 1,144,444 were held on a jointly owned 
equity basis. A Hedging Committee ensures that the Employee 
Share Ownership Trusts hold suffi  cient shares to satisfy existing 
and future awards made under the Plan by buying shares in the 
market or causing the Company to issue new shares.  
Share Incentive Plan
Shareholders approved the introduction of the Avon Rubber 
p.l.c. Share Incentive Plan (the SIP) at the annual general 
meeting in February 2012. All UK tax resident employees of 
the Company and its subsidiaries are entitled to participate. 
Under the SIP participants purchase shares in the Company 
monthly using deductions from their pre-tax pay. The maximum 
contribution each month under the SIP is  125, a sum which 
is set by the Government. Both Mr Slabbert and Mr Lewis 
participate in the SIP at the maximum level. 
Shareholders also approved the introduction of the Avon 
Rubber p.l.c. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP) at the 
annual general meeting in February 2012. The ESPP is open 
to all US tax resident employees and allows participants to 
accumulate deductions from their post-tax pay over an off ering 
period of 12 months. At the conclusion of the off ering period 
the accumulated funds are used to purchase the Company's 
shares at a discount. Neither Mr Slabbert or Mr Lewis are eligible 
to participate in the ESPP. Avon Rubber p.l.c.  Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Pensions and other benefi ts
The current Executive Directors (Mr P.C. Slabbert and Mr A.G. 
Lewis) are both based in the UK and are members of the Avon 
Rubber Retirement and Death Benefi ts Plan. Until 30 September 
2009, when the fi nal salary section of the Plan closed to future 
accrual of benefi ts, Mr Slabbert was a member of the Senior 
Executive Section which provided members with a defi ned level 
of benefi t on retirement depending on length of service and 
earnings. Members can receive a pension of up to two-thirds 
of pensionable salary on retirement from age 60, provided the 
minimum service requirement of 20 years has been met. On 
death in service, a lump sum of four times pensionable salary is 
paid, along with a spouses' pension of one half of the member's 
prospective pension. When an Executive Director dies after 
retirement, a spouse's pension of one half of the member's 
pension is paid. At the time the fi nal salary section of the Plan 
closed to future accrual of benefi ts, in return for Mr Slabbert 
giving up this valuable benefi t, the Company and the Trustee 
agreed to enter into a special benefi t arrangement. Under this 
arrangement for each complete year subsequently worked by 
Mr Slabbert, the age by reference to which a reduction would be 
applied to his pension if he chose to draw it early would reduce 
by 5/8ths of a year, with the end result that after 8 years, no 
reduction would apply if Mr Slabbert retired on or after his 55th 
birthday. Thus, each year over an 8 year period the age at which 
Mr Slabbert can retire early, on an unreduced basis, reduces by 
7.5 months.
During the year to 30 September 2012 Mr Slabbert has been a 
member of the money purchase section of the Plan (see below). 
In line with Company policy which dates back to 2003 for new 
employees in the UK, any UK-based Executive Directors joining 
the Company are off ered defi ned contribution arrangements.
Mr Lewis is therefore a member of the money purchase section 
of the Plan. Members receive a pension based upon the size of 
their retirement account on retirement from age 65. On death 
in service, a lump sum of four times pensionable salary is paid, 
along with a spouses' pension of one quarter of the member's 
pensionable salary. Both Mr Slabbert and Mr Lewis receive a 
company pension contribution of 15% of salary.
Mr Slabbert's total pension benefi ts were approaching  1.5m so 
in March 2012 he ceased making contributions into the money 
purchase section of the Plan to enable him to apply for fi xed 
protection from HMRC to preserve the higher lifetime allowance 
of  1.8m. The Company continued to set aside pension 
contributions on his behalf for the remainder of the fi nancial 
year. On 30 September 2012 these contributions remained held 
by the Company on Mr Slabbert's behalf. Mr Slabbert remains 
covered by the death in service insurance notwithstanding that 
he is no longer an active member of the Plan.
Executive Directors' basic salaries are the only pensionable 
element of their remuneration packages. Executive Directors are 
entitled to participate in employee healthcare plans. 
Neither of the Executive Directors is currently appointed as 
a non-executive director of any limited company outside the 
Group. The Remuneration Committee will establish a policy 
on the treatment of any fees received by Executive Directors in 
respect of such non-executive roles when required.
Contracts
The Company's policy is that Executive Directors should 
normally be employed under a contract which may be 
terminated by either the Company or the Executive Director 
giving 12 months notice and which otherwise expires on 
retirement, currently at age 60 for Mr Slabbert and age 65 
for Mr Lewis. The Company may terminate the contract early 
without cause by making a payment in lieu of notice by monthly 
instalments of salary and benefi ts to a maximum of 12 months, 
with reductions for any amounts received from providing 
services to others during this period. 
The Remuneration Committee may vary these terms if the 
particular circumstances surrounding the appointment of a new 
Executive Director demand it but this would be exceptional and 
has never happened. The Remuneration Committee strongly 
endorses the obligation on an Executive Director to mitigate 
any loss on early termination and will seek to reduce the 
amount payable on termination where it is appropriate to do so. 
The Committee will also take care to ensure that, while meeting 
its contractual obligations, poor performance is not rewarded. 
The Executive Directors' contracts contain early termination 
provisions consistent with the policy outlined above.
The table below summarises key details in respect of each 
Executive Director's contract.

Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors receive a fi xed fee 
for their services. Fee levels are determined by the Board in 
light of market research and advice provided by Ernst & Young. 
Fee levels are reviewed from time to time. The Chairman and 
the Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any Board 
discussions or vote on their own remuneration, nor do they 
participate in any incentive or benefi t plans. 
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors each have 
a letter of appointment which specifi es an initial period of 
appointment. The initial period for Mrs Pirie was three years 
and this was extended for a further three years on 1 March 
2008 and on a rolling annual basis on 1 March 2011. Sir Richard 
Needham's initial period of three years expired on 26 January 
2010 and was extended on a rolling annual basis. As announced 
to shareholders last year, Sir Richard Needham will cease to be 
a Non-Executive Director following the annual general meeting 
on 7 February 2013. The initial period for Mr Evans was also 
three years and this was extended on a rolling annual basis on 
31 May 2010. 
Chairman and Non-Executive Director appointments are subject 
to Board approval and election by shareholders at the annual 
general meeting following appointment and, thereafter, re-
election by rotation every three years. The Chairman and any

OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR HOW WE RUN OUR BUSINESS HOW WE PERFORMED SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Executive Directors' pensions
The Stock Exchange Listing Rules require the disclosure of certain additional information relating to the pensions of Executive Directors 
under defi ned benefi t schemes. The information is set out below.
The age at which Mr P.C. Slabbert may take his pension 
unreduced was reduced by 5/8ths of a year over the year to 30 
September 2012.
On closure of the defi ned benefi t scheme Mr Slabbert joined the 
money purchase section of the plan. Company contributions 
in respect of Mr Slabbert during the year were  21,479 (2011: 
 35,300). Company contributions into the Plan on Mr Slabbert's 
behalf ceased in March 2012 as his total pension benefi ts were 
approaching the standard lifetime allowance. At the year-end 
accrued contributions of  21,000 were held on Mr Slabbert's 
behalf.
In respect of Mr A.G. Lewis, company contributions to the money 
purchase section of the plan were  30,000 (2011:  24,300).
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial 
advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the 
value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer 
to another pension provider on transferring the scheme's 
liability in respect of the Director's pension benefi ts. They do not 
represent sums payable to individual Directors and, therefore, 
cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The accrued entitlement shown is the amount that would be 
paid each year at normal retirement age, based on service to 
the end of the current year. The accrued lump sum, under the 
defi ned benefi t scheme, for Mr Slabbert at 30 September 2012 
was  308,306 (2011:  292,400).

Performance Share Plan 2002 and 2010 (the 2002 Scheme and the 2010 Scheme)
For grants of options or conditional awards made to date pursuant to the 2002 Scheme, and grants of joint ownership awards, options 
or conditional awards made to date pursuant to the 2010 Scheme, the performance conditions have been based on the Company's TSR 
relative to the TSR of a comparator group, comprising the FTSE Small Cap companies (excluding investment trusts). For the Cycle granted 
in 2011/12 a split performance condition applied so that 50% of the award vests in accordance with the TSR target and 50% in accordance 
with an EPS target based on real growth in earnings over the performance period where real growth is expressed as a percentage above 
infl ation. 
In September 2011 the Remuneration Committee decided that the performance condition should be changed to a twofold test based on 
TSR performance and Earnings Per Share (EPS), bringing future awards in line with market practice and thereby encouraging management 
to maintain and increase earnings levels whilst at the same time ensuring that it is not at the expense of longer term shareholder return. 
The Committee has set the EPS target as nil vesting at RPI +3% and maximum vesting at RPI +8% with vesting on a pro rata basis in 
between these two fi gures.
A list of the number of shares under option granted at nil cost, to Executive Directors and senior employees, prior to 30 September 2012 is 
set out below:

* As explained in last year's report the awards granted under the 2007/8 cycle did not vest.
** These awards were reduced to 69% of entitlement to remain within the 5% dilution limit previously contained in the Plan rules. The award vested in full on the  
 basis that the TSR over the three years from 1 October 2008 to 30 September 2011 was signifi cantly ahead of the upper quartile of the comparator group.  
*** This includes awards granted to Mr T.K.P. Stead (stood down 21 April 2008, resigned as a Director on 8 September 2008 and retired on 15 May 2009). 
 All these awards were pro-rated and did not vest as described above.
**** This fi gure includes 284,550 (2011: 334,440) in respect of key management as defi ned in note 8 of the fi nancial statements.
