75 Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Judgements
for the year ended 30 September 2013
Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation 
of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless 
otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
EU Endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
and IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements 
have been prepared under the historical cost convention except 
for financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative 
instruments) held at fair value through profit or loss. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs 
requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of 
applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a  
higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where 
assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial 
statements are disclosed below.
Recent accounting developments
The following standards, amendments and interpretations have 
been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB) or by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (IFRIC) but have not yet been adopted. Subject to 
endorsement by the European Union, these will be adopted in 
future periods. The Group's approach to these is as follows:
 a) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective  
  in 2013
The following amendment has been adopted for the year ended 30 
September 2013:
 - Amendment to IAS 1,  Presentation of Items of Other  
  Comprehensive Income'
The adoption of this amendment has not had a material impact on 
the financial information as it only requires additional disclosure in 
the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income.
 b) Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing  
  standards issued but not yet effective in 2013 and not  
  early adopted
The following new standards, amendments to standards and 
interpretations have been issued, but are not effective for the 
financial year beginning 1 October 2012 and have not been 
adopted early:
 - IFRS 9,  Financial instruments'
 - IFRS 10,  Consolidated financial statements'
 - IFRS 11,  Joint arrangements'
 - IFRS 12,  Disclosure of interests in other entities'
 - IFRS 13,  Fair value measurement'
 - IAS 27 (revised),  Separate financial statements'
 - IAS 28 (revised),  Associates and joint ventures'
 - Amendment to IAS 12,  Income taxes'
 - Amendment to IAS 19,  Employee benefits'
The amendment to IAS 19,  Employee Benefits' is effective for the 
financial year beginning 1 October 2013. The main changes affecting 
the Group are as follows:
  	 Interest income or expense will now be calculated by applying  
 the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.  
 Previously interest cost was calculated on the defined benefit  
 obligation and expected return calculated on plan assets.  
  	 Costs associated with investment management are deducted  
 from the return on plan assets, (which is unchanged from  
 the existing standard). Other expenses are recognised as  
 incurred in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
This is expected to lead to an increase in the costs charged to  
the income statement of  0.8m for the year ending 30 September  
2014 over the cost under the existing standard and a 2.6p reduction  
in earnings per share, with a similar impact on the comparative  
figures for the year ended 30 September 2013.

2013 2014 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial results 
and position of the Group and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to 
govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a 
shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that 
control ceases. 
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the 
acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition 
is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments 
issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. 
Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a 
business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the 
acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling 
interest.  Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on 
transactions between Group companies are eliminated; unrealised 
losses are also eliminated unless costs cannot be recovered. Where 
necessary, accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed to 
ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. 
Foreign currencies
The Group's presentation currency is sterling. The results and financial 
position of all subsidiaries and associates that have a functional 
currency different from sterling are translated into sterling as follows: 
 -    assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the  
  balance sheet date; and
  -    income and expenses are translated at average rates.
All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate 
component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation 
of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other 
currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are 
taken to shareholders' equity. When a foreign operation is sold, the 
cumulative amount of such exchange difference is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the gain 
or loss on sale.
Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded at the exchange 
rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains 
and losses resulting from settlement of such transactions and from 
the translation to exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date of 
monetary assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, 
except when deferred in equity as qualifying hedges.
 
Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received for 
the sale of goods and services, net of trade discounts and sales-
related taxes. Revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards 
of the underlying sale have been transferred to the customer, and 
when collectability of the related receivables is reasonably assured, 
which is usually when title passes or a separately identifiable phase 
of a development contract has been completed and accepted by  
the customer.
Segment reporting
Segments are identified based on management information 
provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating 
decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and 
assessing performance of the operating segments, has been 
identified as the Group Executive team. A business segment is a 
group of assets and operations engaged in providing products 
or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different 
from those of other business segments. A geographical segment 
is engaged in providing products or services within a particular 
economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that 
are different from those of segments operating in other economic 
environments. The chief operating decision-maker assesses the 
performance of the operating segments based on the measures of 
revenue, EBIT and EBITDA. Central overheads, finance income and 
expense and taxation are not allocated to the business segments.
Exceptional items
Transactions are classified as exceptional where they relate to an 
event that falls outside of the ordinary activities of the business and 
where individually or in aggregate they have a material impact on 
the financial statements.
Employee benefits
Pension obligations and post-retirement benefits
The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
The defined benefit plan's asset or liability as recognised in the 
balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined 
by discounting the estimated cash outflows using interest rates of 
high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency 
in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. Actuarial 
gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes 
in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full in the period in which 
they occur, as part of other comprehensive income.  
 
OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR HOW WE RUN OUR BUSINESS HOW WE PERFORMED SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
delivering our strategy Avon Rubber p.l.c.  Annual Report and Accounts 2013
77 For the defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions 
to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a 
mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. Contributions are expensed 
as incurred. 
Share based compensation
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based 
compensation plans, under which the entity receives service from 
employees as consideration for equity instruments (options) of the 
Group. The fair value of the employee service received in exchange 
for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total 
amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of 
the options granted: 
 - including any market performance conditions;
 - excluding the impact of any service and non-market  
  performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability,  
  sales growth targets and remaining an employee of the entity  
  over a specified time period); and
 - including the impact of any non-vesting conditions  
  (for example, the requirement for employees to save).
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about 
the number of options that are expected to vest. The total expense 
is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which 
all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of 
each reporting period, the entity revises its estimates of the number 
of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market 
vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original 
estimates, if any, in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.  
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction 
costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium 
when the options are exercised.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the 
fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable net assets of the 
acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Identifiable net assets 
include intangible assets other than goodwill. Any such intangible 
assets are amortised over their expected future lives unless they 
are regarded as having an indefinite life, in which case they are not 
amortised, but subjected to annual impairment testing in a similar 
manner to goodwill.
Since the transition to IFRS, goodwill arising from acquisitions of 
subsidiaries after 3 October 1998 is included in intangible assets, is not 
amortised but is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost 
less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal 
of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the 
entity sold.
Goodwill arising from acquisitions of subsidiaries before 3 October 
1998, which was set against reserves in the year of acquisition under 
UK GAAP , has not been reinstated and is not included in determining 
any subsequent profit or loss on disposal of the related entity.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever 
there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill is 
allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment 
testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units 
or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit 
from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. Any 
impairment is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income. Subsequent reversals of impairment losses 
for goodwill are not recognised.
Development Expenditure
Expenditure in respect of the development of new products where 
the outcome is assessed as being reasonably certain as regards 
viability and technical feasibility is capitalised and amortised over 
the expected useful life of the development. Expenditure that does 
not meet these criteria is expensed as incurred. The capitalised 
costs are amortised over the estimated period of sale for each 
product, commencing in the year sales of the product are first 
made. Development costs capitalised are tested for impairment 
at least annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset 
may be impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Subsequent 
reversals of impairment losses for research and development are not 
recognised.
Computer Software
Computer software is included in intangible assets at cost and 
amortised over its estimated life. 
Property plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost or deemed 
cost where IFRS 1 exemptions have been applied, less accumulated 
depreciation and any recognised impairment losses.
Costs include the original purchase price of the asset and the costs 
attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its 
intended use including any qualifying finance expenses.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation is provided on other assets 
estimated to write off the depreciable amount of relevant assets by 
equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives.
In general, the rates used are:
    Freehold - 2.5%  
   Short leasehold property - over the period of the lease
   Plant and machinery - 6% to 50%.
 
Avon Rubber p.l.c.  Annual Report and Accounts 2013 delivering our strategy
78
Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Judgements continued
for the year ended 30 September 2013 The residual values and useful lives of the assets are reviewed, and 
adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its 
recoverable amount if its carrying amount is greater than its 
estimated net realisable value. Gains and losses on disposal are 
determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amounts. These 
are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income.
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line 
basis over the period of the lease.  
The sale and lease back of property, where the sale price is at fair 
value and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are 
transferred to the purchaser, is treated as an operating lease. The 
profit or loss on the transaction is recognised immediately and lease 
payments charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  
Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The 
cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, 
direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads 
(based on normal operating capacity). It excludes borrowing costs. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less applicable incremental selling expenses. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and 
subsequently held at amortised cost after deducting provisions for 
impairment of receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand, highly 
liquid interest-bearing securities with maturities of three months 
or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within 
borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have 
been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. 
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is 
due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of 
the business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current 
liabilities. They are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently 
held at amortised cost.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when:
 - the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result  
  of a past event;
 - it is probable that an outflow of resources will be  
  required to settle the obligation and the amount has  
  been reliably estimated.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, for example 
where a warranty has been given, the likelihood that an outflow 
will be required in settlement is determined by considering the 
class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the 
likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in 
the same class of obligation may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures 
expected to be required to settle the obligation. 
Where a leasehold property, or part thereof, is vacant or sub-let 
under terms such that the rental income is insufficient to meet all 
outgoings, provision is made for the anticipated future shortfall up 
to termination of the lease, or the termination payment, if smaller.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction 
costs incurred and subsequently stated at amortised cost. Borrowing 
costs are expensed using the effective interest method.
Taxation
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and 
deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for 
the year, using tax rates substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of prior years.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on 
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial 
statements. However the deferred income tax is not accounted 
for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction other than a business combination that at the time of 
the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. 
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet 
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income 
tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that is 
probable that future taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised.  
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing 
OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR HOW WE RUN OUR BUSINESS HOW WE PERFORMED SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
delivering our strategy Avon Rubber p.l.c.  Annual Report and Accounts 2013
79 of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future.
Income tax is charged or credited in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, except where it relates to items recognised 
in equity, in which case it is dealt with in equity.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and 
liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority 
on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where 
there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. 
 
Dividends
Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the Group's financial 
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by 
shareholders, while interim dividends are recognised in the period in 
which the dividends are paid. 
 
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares  
or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from  
the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Company's equity share 
capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted 
from equity attributable to the Company's equity holders until the 
shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares 
are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net 
of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the 
related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the 
Company's equity holders. 
 
Critical accounting judgements
The Group's principal accounting policies are set out above. 
Management is required to exercise significant judgement and make 
use of estimates and assumptions in the application of these policies.
Areas which management believes require the most critical 
accounting judgements are:
Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme. Actuarial valuations 
of the schemes are carried out as determined by the trustees at 
intervals of not more than three years.
The pension cost under IAS 19 is assessed in accordance with the 
advice of an independent qualified actuary based on the latest 
actuarial valuation and assumptions determined by the actuary.   
The assumptions are based on information supplied to the actuary 
by the Group, supplemented by discussions between the actuary 
and management. The assumptions and sensitivities are disclosed in 
note 10 of the financial statements.
Inventory provisions
At each balance sheet date, each subsidiary evaluates the 
recoverability of inventories and records provision against these 
based on an assessment of net realisable values. The actual net 
realisable value of inventory may differ from the estimated realisable 
values, which could impact on operating results positively or 
negatively.
Impairment of intangible assets
The Group records all assets and liabilities acquired in business 
acquisitions, including goodwill, at fair value. Intangible assets which 
have an indefinite useful life, principally goodwill, are assessed 
annually for impairment.
The Group is engaged in the development of new products and 
processes. The costs of which are capitalised as intangible assets or 
property, plant and equipment if, in the opinion of management, 
there is a reasonable expectation of economic benefits being 
achieved. The factors considered in making these judgements 
include the likelihood of future orders and the anticipated volumes, 
margins and duration associated with these.
Impairment charges are made if there is significant doubt as to the 
sufficiency of future economic benefits to justify the carrying values 
of the assets based upon discounted cash flow projections using an 
appropriate risk weighted discount factor. Rates used were between 
10% and 15%.
Provisions
Provisions are made in respect of receivables/accrued income, 
claims, onerous contractual obligations and warranties based on the 
judgement of management taking into account the nature of the 
claim/contractual obligation, the range of possible outcomes and 
the defences open to the Group.
Taxation
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns 
where the applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. The 
Group establishes provisions on the basis of amounts expected to 
be paid to tax authorities only where it is considered more likely 
than not that an amount will be paid or received. The Group applies 
this test to each individual uncertain position. The Group measures 
the uncertain positions based on the single most likely outcome.
When determining whether to recognise deferred tax assets 
management considers the likely availability of future taxable profits 
in the relevant jurisdiction.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets where it is probable that these 
assets will be recovered.
The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013. Accordingly the average standard rate for 
the year is 23.5%.
A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2013 Budget Statement. The Finance Bill 2012, which was 
substantively enacted on 2 July 2013, includes legislation reducing the main rate of corporation tax to 21% from 1 April 2014.
The change in rate had no material impact on the Group's deferred tax assets and liabilities as the Group's deferred tax liabilities are held in  
the US.
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets in respect of the following matters in the UK, as it is uncertain when the criteria for 
recognition of these assets will be met.

On 2 February 2013, the shareholders approved a final dividend of 2.4p per qualifying ordinary share in respect of the year ended 30 September 
2012. This was paid on 15 March 2013 absorbing  708,000 of shareholders' funds. 
On 22 April 2013 the Board of Directors declared an interim dividend of 1.44p (2012: 1.2p) per qualifying ordinary share in respect of the year 
ended 30 September 2013. This was paid on 6 September 2013 absorbing  424,000 (2012:  353,000) of shareholders' funds. 
After the balance sheet date the Board of Directors proposed a final dividend of 2.88p per qualifying ordinary share in respect of the year ended 
30 September 2013, which will absorb an estimated  862,000 of shareholders' funds. Subject to shareholder approval, the dividend will be paid 
on 21 March 2014 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 21 February 2014. In accordance with accounting standards this 
dividend has not been provided for and there are no corporation tax consequences. 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the employee share ownership trust. The company has dilutive potential 
ordinary shares in respect of the Performance Share Plan (see page 68). Adjusted earnings per share removes the effect of the amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets and exceptional items. 
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

89 10 PENSIONS AND OTHER RETIREMENT BENEFITS
Full disclosures are provided in respect of the UK defined benefit pension scheme below.
The Group operated a contributory defined benefits plan to provide pension and death benefits for the employees of Avon Rubber p.l.c. and its 
Group undertakings in the UK employed prior to 31 January 2003. The scheme was closed to future accrual of benefit on 1 October 2009. The 
assets of the plan are held in separate trustee administered funds and are invested by professional investment managers. The trustee is Avon 
Rubber Pension Trust Limited, the Directors of which are members of the plan. Four of the Directors are appointed by the Company and two are 
elected by the members.
Pension costs are assessed on the advice of an independent consulting actuary using the projected unit method. The funding of the plan is 
based on regular actuarial valuations. The most recent finalised actuarial valuation of the plan was carried out at 31 March 2011 when the market 
value of the plan's assets was  269.3m. The actuarial value of those assets represented 98.4% of the value of the benefits which had accrued to 
members, after allowing for future increases in pensions.
During the year the Company made payments to the fund of  592,000 (2012:  625,000) in respect of scheme expenses and deficit recovery plan 
payments. In accordance with the deficit recovery plan agreed following the 31 March 2011 actuarial valuation, the Company will make deficit 
recovery payments in 2014 of  300,000 in addition to  175,000 towards scheme expenses.
An updated actuarial valuation for IAS 19 purposes was carried out by an independent actuary at 30 September 2013 using the projected  
unit method.
The main financial assumptions used by the independent qualified actuary to calculate the liabilities under IAS 19 are set out below:
Retirement benefit assets and liabilities can be analysed as follows:
   2013 2012 
    '000  '000
Pension liability   (11,279) (2,238)

Pension increases post August 2005  2.10 1.90 
Pension increases pre August 2005  3.00 2.50 
Discount rate for scheme liabilities  4.50 4.55
The scheme actuary estimates a 0.1% change in the discount rate would change the value of scheme liabilities by approximately 1.6% (2012: 1.5%).

Mortality rate 
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice, published statistics and experience. The average life expectancy in 
years of a pensioner retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date is as follows:
  2013 2012
Male  22.0 22.1 
Female  24.2 24.2
The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65, 20 years after the balance sheet 
date is as follows:
  2013 2012
Male  23.4 23.6 
Female  25.7 25.8
The Liability Driven Investment ('LDI') comprises a series of LIBOR-earning cash deposits which are combined with contracts to hedge interest 
rate and inflation rate risk over the expected life of the scheme's liabilities.
*Avon Rubber employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. Historical markets are 
studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles. 
The assumed long-term rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over the actual asset 
allocation for the plan as at 30 September 2013.
The assets in the scheme and the expected rate of return were:

Financial instruments by category
Trade and other receivables (excluding prepayments) and cash and cash equivalents are classified as 'loans and receivables'. Borrowings and 
trade and other payables are classified as 'other financial liabilities at amortised cost'. Both categories are initially measured at fair value and 
subsequently held at amortised cost.
Derivatives (forward exchange contracts) are classified as 'derivatives used for hedging' and accounted for at fair value with gains and  
losses taken to reserves through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
 
Financial risk and treasury policies
The Group's treasury management team maintains liquidity, manages relations with the Group's bankers, identifies and manages foreign 
exchange risk and provides a treasury service to the Group's businesses. Treasury dealings such as investments, borrowings and foreign 
exchange are conducted only to support underlying business transactions.
The Group has clearly defined policies for the management of foreign exchange rate risk. The Group treasury management team is not a 
profit centre and, therefore, does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure. Exposures 
resulting from sales and purchases in foreign currency are matched where possible and the net exposure may be hedged by the use of forward 
exchange contracts. 
 
(i) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, 
and arises principally from the Group's receivables from customers and monies on deposit with financial institutions.
The US Government through the Department of Defense is a major customer of the Group. Credit evaluations are carried out on all non-
Government customers requiring credit above a certain threshold, with varying approval levels set above this depending on the value of the 
sale. At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk, except in respect of the US Government noted above.
Counterparty risk arises from the use of derivative financial instruments. This is managed through credit limits, counterparty approvals and 
rigorous monitoring procedures.
Where possible, goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event of non-payment the Group may have a secure claim.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment in respect of receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
Exposure to credit risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was:

The total past due receivables, net of provisions is  1,922,000 (2012:  1,205,000).
The individually impaired receivables mainly relate to a number of independent customers. A portion of these receivables is expected to be 
recovered.
(ii) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group's approach to managing 
liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed 
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.
The Group uses weekly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its borrowing position. Typically the Group ensures 
that it has sufficient borrowing facility to meet foreseeable operational expenses and at the year end had facilities of  23.9m (2012:  23.9m).
The following shows the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments, where applicable and excluding the impact of 
netting agreements and on an undiscounted basis:

101 (iii) Market risks
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as currency rates and interest rates, will affect the Group's results. The objective of 
market risk management is to manage and control risk within suitable parameters.
(a) Currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than sterling. The currencies 
giving rise to this risk are primarily the US dollar and related currencies and the Euro. The Group hedges material forecast US dollar or Euro 
foreign currency transactional exposures using forward exchange contracts. In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies 
other than sterling, the Group ensures that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level, by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates 
where necessary to address short-term imbalances.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value through 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Fair value is assessed by reference to year end spot exchange rates, adjusted for forward 
points associated with contracts of similar duration. The fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges at 30 September 2013 was a 
 214,000 asset (2012:  121,000) comprising an asset of  214,000 (2012:  121,000) and a liability of nil (2012: nil).
All forward exchange contracts in place at 30 September 2013 mature within one year.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued

(b) Interest rate risk
The Group does not undertake any hedging activity in this area. All foreign currency cash deposits are made at prevailing interest rates and 
where rates are fixed the period of the fix is generally not more than one month. The main element of interest rate risk concerns borrowings 
which are made on a floating LIBOR-based rate and short-term overdrafts in foreign currencies which are also on a floating rate.
The Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations and with net debt of  10.9m (2012:  8.7m) a 1% movement in interest rates would impact the 
interest costs by  109,000 (2012:  87,000).
The floating rate financial liabilities comprise bank loans bearing floating interest rates fixed by reference to the relevant LIBOR or equivalent rate. 
All cash deposits are on floating rates or overnight rates based on the relevant LIBOR or equivalent rate.
Sensitivity analysis
It is estimated that, with all other variables held equal (in particular other exchange rates), a general change of five cents in the value of the 
US dollar against sterling would have had a  368,000 (2012:  378,000) impact on the Group's current year profit before interest and tax and 
a  294,000 (2012:  274,000) impact on the Group's profit after tax. The method of estimation, which has been applied consistently, involves 
assessing the translation impact of US dollar and Euro cash flows. 
The following significant exchange rates applied during year:

(iv) Capital risk management
The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns 
for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio, calculated as net debt divided by capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings 
less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is measured by the current market capitalisation of the Group, plus net debt. The increased market 
capitalisation has positively impacted the gearing ratio in 2013 as shown below.
The Group's net debt at the balance sheet date was:

Basis for determining fair value
The following summarises the significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the 
table above.
Derivatives 
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined by using valuation techniques using year-end spot rates, adjusted for the forward 
points to the contract's value date. No contract's value date is greater than one year from the year end. These instruments are included in level 2 
in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation is based on inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable.
Secured loans 
As the loans are floating rate borrowings, amortised cost is deemed to reflect fair value.
Trade and other receivables/payables 
As the majority of receivables/payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.

On 26 April 2013 Avon Polymer Products Limited acquired 100% of the share capital of VR Technology Holdings Limited (VR), a market leader 
in diving rebreather systems and dive computers, for consideration of  833,000. VR's products and key technologies will complement and 
enhance the Group's current and planned product ranges and increase respiratory protection opportunities for the Group, particularly with 
navies around the world.
The results of the acquired entity have been consolidated in the Group's consolidated statement of comprehensive income from 26 April 2013 
and contributed  278,000 of revenue and a loss of  126,000 to the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Group during the year.
The impact of the acquisition on the consolidated balance sheet was as follows:
The goodwill is attributable to the workforce of the acquired business and synergies expected to arise in the period following the acquisition. 
The Directors have reviewed the goodwill for impairment and concluded that the carrying value is recoverable. Full details of the review are not 
disclosed given the immateriality of the goodwill balance.
The contingent consideration becomes payable over the next three years, providing certain performance conditions are met, based on both 
qualitative and quantitative factors. The range of outcomes is expected to be between nil and  200,000.
Had VR been consolidated from 1 October 2012, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income would show revenue of  124,863,000 
and profit for the year of  9,637,000.
