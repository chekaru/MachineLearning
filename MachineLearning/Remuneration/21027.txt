 Remuneration report
Annual Report and Accounts 2004 29
The Committee
The Remuneration Committee advises the board on the group's
policy on executive remuneration and determines the
remuneration packages of each of the Executive Directors.
At 31 March 2004 the committee was made up of the following
Directors:
Jim McKenna (Chairman)
Andrew Carr-Locke
Bill Cockburn
Frances Heaton
Sue Lyons
All committee members served throughout the year except
Andrew Carr-Locke who was appointed on 2 October 2003. Jim
Cronin served during the year until he resigned on 30 July 2003.
Peter Hickson and Jonson Cox attend the meetings but do not
participate in discussions concerning their own remuneration.
The committee has access to advice from the Group Human
Resources and Communications Director, Mike Keohane, and 
the Company Secretary and Group Legal Counsel, Patrick Firth. 
The committee has appointed New Bridge Street Consultants as
external advisors. In addition Kepler Associates has assisted in the
development of the proposed new Long-Term Incentive Plan
(LTIP). Neither advisor provides any other service to the company.
A complete review of all aspects of Directors' remuneration is
carried out annually, taking into account comparable practice in
similar companies and the financial and operational performance
of the group.
Remuneration policy
In formulating remuneration policy, the committee's objective 
is to ensure that remuneration policies and practices for the
Executive Directors are consistent with those for the wider body
of senior managers across the group. The policy is designed to
attract, retain and motivate the Executive Directors whilst
reflecting their levels of responsibility and experience. In addition,
the current policy aims to align the interests of executives with
those of all the company's stakeholders by ensuring that the
award of annual bonuses reflects a balance between financial
and non-financial measures. Long-term incentives are designed
to reward the achievement of long-term performance targets.
The remuneration policy is designed to ensure that there is a
significant emphasis on the performance-linked element. To this
end, base salaries are targeted at median when compared with
similar companies in the utilities and support services sectors.
Executives and senior managers are able to achieve upper
quartile earnings via the annual bonus scheme and the Executive
Share Option Scheme (ESOS) only if demanding performance
targets are achieved.
To assess competitive practice, the committee currently reviews
the remuneration packages for Directors and senior executives
against three groups of UK companies:
  Water companies
  Comparable companies with a similar market capitalisation 
or enterprise value
  Support service companies.
Remuneration package
Each Executive Director's package comprises four elements: base
salary and benefits, annual bonus, participation in an Executive
Share Option Scheme and pension. The benefits comprise a car
or cash equivalent; insurance policies covering disability, personal
accident and health insurance; 30 days' holiday and, in common
with all UK-based employees, participation in a Sharesave
Scheme. As Chairman, Peter Hickson receives the fees and
benefits detailed on page 32. He does not participate in the
annual bonus, the Executive Share Option Scheme or the
Sharesave Scheme.
Base salary and benefits
Base salary and benefits are reviewed annually, taking into
account competitive practice. The committee targets the median
position when base salary is compared with comparator
companies.
Incentive arrangements
Annual bonus scheme
The Executive Directors and other senior managers participate 
in an annual bonus scheme, which rewards them for achieving
demanding short-term performance targets addressing the
interests of all the group's stakeholders. The annual bonus for
the year ended 31 March 2004, which was not pensionable, 
was a maximum of 60 per cent of base salary. 
To attain this bonus, performance is assessed using measured
objectives for operating profit after exceptional items, cash flow,
earnings per share and personal targets. Where appropriate,
consideration is given to health and safety and operational
effectiveness, including environmental compliance.
For the coming year the maximum bonus will remain at 60 per
cent of base salary, on the basis that the maximum bonus will
only be paid if demanding targets are met. Performance will 
be assessed against the objectives detailed in the previous
paragraph. Achieving the Business Plan targets will provide 
a payment of 20 per cent of base salary.
The committee recognises that it is in the interests of all
shareholders that Executive Directors build up a personal stake in
the company. Accordingly, the annual bonus scheme provides
that one third of the post-tax annual bonus is required to be
invested in AWG shares for a period of three years. If earnings
per share targets are achieved over this period, participants
receive matching free shares in AWG Plc equal in value to 
the gross amount of the bonus used to buy the shares. 
The performance targets have been the same as for the ESOS,
but for 2004 onwards will be the same as the new Long-Term
Incentive Plan, see over.
Long-Term Incentive Plan 1997 to 2000
From 1997 to 2000 the Executive Directors and some senior
managers received an allocation of shares under a Long-Term
Incentive Plan (LTIP). Under the plan each participant was
allocated a number of shares (with a value not exceeding 100
per cent of base salary per annum). Any release was dependent
on performance against an earnings per share target. As that
target was not achieved, no shares were released. Remuneration report continued
30 AWG Plc
Executive Share Option Scheme 2001 to 2004
An Executive Share Option Scheme replaced the Long-Term
Incentive Plan in 2001. Its participants are the Executive Directors
and a number of senior managers.
Under the scheme, each participant received annual option
grants, equating to a percentage of base salary, which varied
accordingly to seniority up to a maximum of three times base
salary each year. The exercise of options depends on the
company's growth in earnings per share relative to inflation,
which the committee considered to be the most appropriate way
of measuring the company's underlying financial performance.
Earnings per share targets are measured from a fixed base,
initially over a three-year period. Conditions apply, so that a
proportion (one third) of the options are exercisable if earnings
per share (EPS) growth exceeds inflation by an average of three
per cent per annum, rising to the full exercise of options if EPS
growth exceeds inflation by 14 per cent per annum. No options
are exercisable if EPS growth is less than an average of three per
cent per annum above inflation. Between three per cent and 14
per cent growth, the proportion of options that may be exercised
increases on a straight-line basis.
There is scope to retest the performance conditions at the end 
of the fourth and fifth financial year, from the same fixed base. 
It is intended that earnings per share as defined in the scheme
rules will be assessed independently by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP and verified by the Remuneration Committee.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were selected for this purpose in
their capacity as the company's auditors.
Long-Term Incentive Plan 2004
A new LTIP will be submitted at the 2004 AGM for approval. 
The proposed LTIP rewards three-year total shareholder return
(with no retesting) against an index of comparable water and
infrastructure-management companies. Awards are normally
expected to be in the range of 25 per cent to a maximum of 120
per cent of salary and to be made only to a limited number of
senior executives. For awards to vest in full, upper decile
performance must be achieved.
In parallel with the introduction of the new LTIP, the company
will also adopt shareholding guidelines for directors and
participating senior executives.
Further details are included in the AGM notice, which is available
on the company's website, www.awg.com.
Service contracts
All Executive Directors have service contracts with a notice period
of one year. None of the service contracts provides for a pre-
determined amount of compensation in the event of early
termination beyond an executive's notice period.
Director Date of contract
Jonson Cox 15 January 2004
Elliott Mannis 22 July 1998
Roy Pointer 19 January 1998
New service contracts for Roy Pointer and Elliott Mannis were
issued on 14 June 2000 consequent to the introduction of AWG
Plc as the new holding company under Section 425 of the
Companies Act 1985 (Scheme of Arrangement).
Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements and are
initially appointed under letters of appointment for two three-
year terms. This is subject to re-appointment after the first term,
which is not automatic. Their current terms of appointment
expire on the following dates:

Performance graph
These graphs illustrate the performance of AWG Plc compared
to the FTSE mid-250 index. The committee considers this to be
the most appropriate broad market equity index for illustrating
the company's performance relative to other companies with a
similar market capitalisation. The first graph details the period
following AWG's Scheme of Arrangement in October 2000. 
An additional graph is detailed below illustrating the company's
performance over a five-year period. 
This graph shows the value, by the end of March 2004, of  100 invested in
AWG on 9 October 2000 (the first day of dealing in the shares after the
Scheme of Arrangement) compared with the value of  100 invested in the FTSE
mid-250 Index. The other points plotted are the values of the intervening
financial year ends.

Pensions
The Directors and former Directors in the tables below are
members of the AWG Pension Scheme (AWGPS) (Roy Pointer) or
the AWG Executive Pension Scheme (AWGEPS) (Elliott Mannis,
Euan McEwan and Tony Eckford).
Roy Pointer is a member of the Mirror Image Section of the
AWGPS. The Mirror Image Section's normal retirement age is 65,
or as early as age 60 on reaching 40 years' service. The maximum
benefits are attained after 45 years' service, being a pension of
56 per cent of pensionable salary plus a lump sum of 168 per
cent of pensionable salary. Pensionable salary is base salary and
benefits, excluding bonus payments. Pensions in payment are
increased annually in line with price inflation.
The AWGEPS provides for a maximum pension, at a normal
retirement age of 60, after 20 years' service, equal to two thirds
of basic salary. Pension benefits are calculated on base salary
only. Pensions in payment are increased annually with price
inflation of up to five per cent.
The AWGPS and AWGEPS are exempt approved pension
schemes, and provide benefits to the extent permitted by Inland 
Revenue limits. The group had established funded, 
unapproved, retirement benefit schemes (FURBS) to provide
benefits above this level in respect of Elliott Mannis and 
Tony Eckford.
The Remuneration Committee regards the AWGEPS and defined
benefit section of AWGPS as closed to new members. All new
Executive Directors and senior managers will be provided with a
defined contribution pension arrangement. This would normally
be within the defined contribution section of the AWGPS,
created in 2002 for new joiners.
For all Executive Directors there is a payment of a lump sum 
in the event of death in service, equivalent to four times salary,
and pensions for their dependents. 
The pensions benefits of Directors in the year to 31 March 2004
are summarised below in accordance with the Companies Act
1985 and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority
(rounded to the nearest thousand pounds).
The transfer values disclosed in the two tables above are
actuarially determined to provide for pensions liability and not
sums paid by the company to the individuals concerned. They
cannot meaningfully be added to their annual remuneration.
Tony Eckford and Elliott Mannis participated in funded,
unapproved, retirement benefit schemes (FURBS). Details of the
amounts paid by the company in respect of these arrangements
for the year ending 31 March 2004 are shown in the table of
