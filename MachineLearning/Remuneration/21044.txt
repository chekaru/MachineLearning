 Remuneration report
The committee
The Remuneration Committee advises the board on the group's
policy on executive remuneration and determines the
remuneration packages of each of the Executive Directors and 
the six most senior managers.
At 31 March 2005 the committee was made up of the following
Directors:
Bill Cockburn (Chairman)
Frances Heaton
Sue Lyons
All committee members served throughout the year and met on
four occasions. Jim McKenna and Andrew Carr-Locke served
during the year until they stepped down from the Remuneration
Committee on 28 July 2004.
Peter Hickson and Jonson Cox attend the meetings but do not
participate in discussions concerning their own remuneration. 
The committee is supported by the Group Director of Human
Resources, Susannah Clements, and the Company Secretary and
Group Legal Counsel, Patrick Firth. 
In the past year in order to provide advice on Executive Director
remuneration, the committee has appointed Kepler Associates,
which had previously assisted in the development of the 2004
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Kepler Associates do not provide
any other service to the company. A complete review of all
aspects of Directors' remuneration is carried out annually, taking
into account comparable practice in similar companies and the
financial and operational performance of the group.
Remuneration policy
The primary aim is to ensure that AWG is well managed by high
calibre executives who are encouraged to produce superior
performance and leadership on a sustainable basis for the benefit
of shareholders, customers and employees. The remuneration
package is therefore designed to attract, retain, motivate and
reward the top team of AWG whilst reflecting their
responsibilities and experience. In addition, the current policy
aims to align the interests of executives with those of all the
company's stakeholders by ensuring that the award of annual
bonuses reflects a balance between financial and non-financial
measures. Long-term incentives are in place to reward the
achievement of long-term performance targets.
The remuneration policy is designed to ensure that there is a
significant emphasis on the performance-linked element of total
compensation. To this end, base salaries are targeted at median
when compared with similar companies in the utilities and
support services sectors. Executives and senior managers are able
to achieve additional earnings via the annual bonus scheme and
the LTIP only if demanding performance targets are achieved. 
Objective benchmarking of other relevant peer group companies
is carried out by Kepler Associates to guide the committee in its
annual review of remuneration. The main focus of comparison 
is towards:
  Water companies
  Support service companies
  Comparable companies with a similar enterprise value.
Over the coming year, there will, as usual, be individual reviews of
base salary, annual bonus and LTIP awards.
Remuneration package
Each Executive Director's package comprises four elements: base
salary and benefits, annual bonus, participation in the LTIP and
pension. The benefits comprise a car or cash equivalent; insurance
policies covering disability, personal accident and health insurance;
30 days' holiday and, in common with all UK-based employees,
participation in a Sharesave Scheme and Sharebuy Plan. As
Chairman, Peter Hickson receives the fees and benefits detailed on
page 42. He does not participate in the annual bonus, the LTIP , the
Sharesave Scheme or the Sharebuy Plan. 
Base salary and benefits
Base salary and benefits are reviewed annually, taking into
account competitive practice. The committee targets the median
position when base salary is compared with similar companies.
Incentive arrangements
Annual bonus scheme
The Executive Directors and other senior managers participate in
an annual bonus scheme, which rewards them for achieving
demanding short-term performance targets and personal
objectives. The annual bonus scheme comprises two elements,
one year business plan targets (earning two thirds of the bonus)
and personal objectives (earning one third of bonus). 50 per cent
of the business plan element pays out if the annual budget is
achieved and the other 50 per cent for exceeding the plan to
levels approved by the committee. For Executive Directors, the
maximum bonus payable is 60 per cent of base salary and for
senior managers the maximum bonus ranges between 35 per
cent and 60 per cent.
The committee recognises that it is in the interests of all
shareholders that Executive Directors build up a personal stake in
the company and as a result has developed share ownership
guidelines as outlined on page 40. Accordingly, the 2004/05
Annual Retained Bonus Scheme provides that one third of the
post-tax annual bonus is required to be invested in AWG shares
for a period of three years. If performance targets are achieved
over this period, participants receive matching free shares in AWG
Plc equal in value to the gross amount of the bonus used to buy
the shares. 
The performance target for the 2003/04 scheme is the same as
that for the awards made in 2004 under the LTIP . 
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) 2001 to 2003
The ESOS 2001 to 2003 was replaced by an LTIP and no further
grants of options were made under this scheme during 2004/05. 
The participants of the scheme were the Executive Directors 
and a number of senior managers.
Under the scheme, each participant received annual option
grants, equating to a percentage of base salary, which varied
according to seniority up to a maximum of three times base salary
each year. The exercise of options depends on the company's
growth in earnings per share (as defined in the scheme rules)
relative to inflation, which the committee considered to be the
most appropriate way of measuring the company's underlying
financial performance.
Annual Report and Accounts 2005 39 Remuneration report continued
Earnings per share (EPS) targets are measured from a fixed base,
initially over a three-year period. Conditions apply, so that a
proportion (one third) of the options are exercisable if EPS growth
exceeds inflation by an average of three per cent per annum,
rising to the full exercise of options if EPS growth exceeds
inflation by 14 per cent per annum. No options are exercisable if
EPS growth is less than an average of three per cent per annum
above inflation. Between three per cent and 14 per cent growth,
the proportion of options that may be exercised increases on a
straight-line basis.
There is scope to retest the performance conditions at the end of
the fourth and fifth financial year, from the same fixed base. 
The performance conditions are reviewed independently and
confirmed by the Remuneration Committee. The 2001 ESOS did
not meet its minimum performance conditions in the three year
period to 31 March 2004 but will be subject to retesting in 2005
and 2006 following completion of the financial periods ending
31 March 2005 and 2006.
Long-Term Incentive Plan 2004
The 2004 LTIP was approved at the 2004 AGM and replaces the
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS). Under this plan, Directors
and senior managers may receive, at the discretion of the
Remuneration Committee, annual awards of performance vesting
shares. Awards are normally in the range of 25 per cent to 120
per cent of salary, although these were increased by up to 25 per
cent during the first cycle of the plan for new joiners. 
The proportion of shares that vests will depend upon the
company's performance in terms of total shareholder return
(TSR). The use of relative TSR is considered an objective measure
of the company's success, as it aligns managers' and
shareholders' interests and can be readily benchmarked relative to
peers. The comparator index is weighted 80 per cent on the five
major water companies which are considered to be the company's
closest peers (Kelda, Northumbrian, Pennon, Severn Trent and
United Utilities). The balance (20 per cent) of the comparator
index is based on the smaller listed water companies and seven
other companies considered to be peers of the Morrison business
(Bristol Water, Dee Valley, East Surrey, South Staffordshire, Alfred
MacAlpine, Amec, Balfour Beatty, Carillion, Costain, Jarvis, and 
W S Atkins). The shares vest in full only if the TSR exceeds that of
the index by at least 6.5 per cent per year, with 25 per cent of the
shares vesting if the TSR matches the index. Between these levels
of performance, vesting is based upon a straight-line sliding-scale.
No shares vest if the TSR is below the performance of the
weighted index and there is no re-testing.
As a matter of policy all Executive Directors and certain senior
executives are required to retain a minimum shareholding in the
company, equivalent to annual base salary for Executive Directors
and 50 per cent of base salary for certain senior executives. Fifty
per cent of any post-tax award made under the LTIP will be
retained until these guidelines are achieved.
Service contracts
All Executive Directors have service contracts with a notice period
of one year from the company and six months from the Executive
Director. None of the service contracts provides for a pre-
determined amount of compensation in the event of early
termination.

Pensions
The Directors and former Directors in the tables below are
members of the AWG Pension Scheme (AWGPS), (Roy Pointer) or
the AWG Executive Pension Scheme (AWGEPS), (Elliott Mannis
and Euan McEwan). 
Roy Pointer is a member of the Mirror Image Section of the
AWGPS. The Mirror Image Section's normal retirement age is 65,
or as early as age 60 on reaching 40 years' service. The maximum
benefits are attained after 45 years' service, being a pension of 56
per cent of pensionable salary plus a lump sum of 168 per cent of
pensionable salary. Pensionable salary is base salary and benefits,
excluding bonus payments. Pensions in payment are increased
annually in line with price inflation. Roy Pointer resigned as a 
Director on 26 April 2005 prior to his retirement and will receive
his normal benefits under the Scheme Rules.
The AWGEPS provides for a maximum pension, at a normal
retirement age of 60, after 20 years' service, equal to two thirds
of basic salary. Pension benefits are calculated on base salary only.
Pensions in payment are increased annually with price inflation of
up to five per cent.
The AWGPS and AWGEPS are exempt approved pension schemes,
and provide benefits to the extent permitted by Inland Revenue
limits. The group had established a funded, unapproved,
retirement benefit scheme (FURBS) to provide benefits above this
level in respect of Elliott Mannis. Mr Mannis had a pension
promise of two thirds of uncapped pensionable salary provided
he remained in service until Normal Retirement Date (NRD). On
leaving before NRD, the benefit entitlement was the accrued
AWGEPS pension plus the value of the contributions invested in
the FURBS. 
The AWGEPS and defined benefit section of AWGPS are closed to
new members. All new Executive Directors and senior managers
are provided with a defined contribution pension arrangement.
This will be within the defined contribution section of the
AWGPS, created in 2002 for new joiners.
For all Executive Directors there is a payment of a lump sum in the
event of death in service, equivalent to four times salary, and
pensions for their dependents. 
The pensions benefits of Directors in the year to 31 March 2005
are summarised below

The figures include ordinary shares held in trust for Directors as the share element of the annual bonus scheme, being at 31 March
2005 (with 31 March 2004 figures in brackets), Jonson Cox 1,927 (nil) and Roy Pointer 7,287 (4,332). 
25 per cent of the fee paid to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors is invested in shares in the company. To simplify
administration all those shares are purchased in a single tranche, in September, and the monthly payments adjusted accordingly.
Consequently the 25 per cent invested in shares represents an advance fee. These shares are included in the above figures, being 
at 31 March 2005: Peter Hickson, 3,359; Bill Cockburn, 1,343; Frances Heaton, 1,007; Sue Lyons, 783; Jim McKenna, 783 and Andrew
Carr-Locke, 783. The Directors must hold these shares for the duration of their appointment. If an appointment is terminated for any
reason during any year, for which an advance fee has been paid, the Director concerned is obliged to repay the appropriate portion 
of the advance fee for that year.
