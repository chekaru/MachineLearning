 Annual Report & Accounts 2006 18  Axeon Holdings plc 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining, 
within agreed terms of reference, the policy for the remuneration 
of the executive directors. The committee is also responsible for 
determining the individual remuneration packages for executive 
directors including basic salary and annual bonuses, the level 
and terms of grants of options and awards and the terms of any 
performance conditions to apply to the exercise of such options 
and awards, pension rights and other benefits. When appropriate, 
the committee will also make recommendations in relation to the 
remuneration of senior management.
The Remuneration Committee consists of independent  
non-executive directors. The Chairman of the committee is 
Charles Matthews and the other members are Lawrence Berns, 
Paul Johnston and James Kenny. Given their experience the 
independent non-executive directors are able to offer a balanced 
view with respect to remuneration issues of the group. The 
committee has access to independent advice from external 
advisers who do not have any connection with the company or 
group and draws on independent salary data for AIM companies. 
The committee consults with the Chief Executive Officer on the 
remuneration of the other executive directors. The Chief Executive 
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer normally attend part of  
the Remuneration Committee meetings. No director is involved  
in approving their own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration 
in a form and amount that will attract, retain, motivate and reward 
high calibre directors and senior management. The committee 
believes that base salary and benefits for executive directors 
should form a fair return for the employment, but that over time 
a substantial part of the total rewards should be derived from 
performance related elements of the remuneration package.  
The performance related elements of the executive directors' 
packages seek to align their interests closely with those of the 
shareholders and provide incentives for performance.
Executive directors' employment contracts
The executive directors' employment contracts are continuing 
contracts subject to termination on 3 months' written notice 
by the company. There are no provisions for compensation on 
early termination in any of the executive directors' employment 
contracts.
Executive directors' remuneration packages
Details of individual executives directors' remuneration are 
included in the table on the next page. Remuneration packages 
for executive directors consist of the following elements:
Fixed elements
Base salary and benefits - The committee reviews base salaries 
annually taking account of relevant external market comparisons, 
the level of responsibility of each executive and movements in 
basic pay across the group. Executive directors can also benefit 
from the Axeon Group Life Assurance Scheme, and are eligible 
for the Axeon Group Pension Scheme, a defined contribution 
money purchase scheme that is open to all members of the 
group. Pension contributions are made on basic salary only.
Variable elements
Performance related bonuses - The level of bonuses (if any) 
recommended by the committee is determined on the basis of the 
financial and operational targets established at the beginning of 
the financial year. 
Share option plans
The company operates the Axeon approved and unapproved  
share option schemes, details of which are given on page 20. 
Under the schemes, options over the company's ordinary shares 
may be granted to all employees, including executive directors. 
Exercise of options granted under the approved and unapproved 
schemes are subject to performance criteria which are detailed  
on page 20. The information on grants is also set out on page 20.
Pensions
The group operates a group personal pension plan and makes 
contributions for directors as set out in the table on page 19.
Non-executive directors' remuneration
The remuneration of non-executive directors is established by  
the board within the limits set out in the Articles of Association. 
The non-executive directors may also be awarded share options 
under separate non approved standalone agreements, but are  
not eligible for bonuses and do not receive any other benefits  
or rights under the pension scheme.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts. 
However, they each have a letter of appointment that contains  
a notice period of three months. The letters of appointment  
set out the expected time commitment for non-executives.  
Any other significant commitments are disclosed to the board  
and significant changes brought to the board's attention.  
Non-executive directors are not appointed for specific terms but  
are subject to re-election by shareholders every three or four  
years under the rotation provisions contained in the company's 
Articles of Association.

Share option schemes
The group operates two share option schemes, an Inland Revenue 
approved share option scheme ( the approved scheme') and 
an unapproved scheme. In addition, there are a number of 
standalone agreements for current and former directors of the 
company. The rules of all of the schemes and agreements are 
substantially the same, except as described below.
The schemes are open to all employees, including executive  
and non-executive directors. The grant of options is at the 
discretion of the directors upon recommendation by the 
Remuneration Committee. The latest date for exercise of  
options under both schemes is ten years from the date of grant. 
The earliest date is dependent on achievement of performance 
criteria, except that the standalone agreements for former 
directors carry no performance criteria and are exercisable  
in full from the date of issue.
The performance criteria for options granted up to  
31 December 2005 require that the group has achieved 
cumulative revenue - including from the commencement  
of operations of Axeon T echnologies Limited - of:
    1 million for 20% of the options to vest;
    3 million for 40% of the options to vest;
    5 million for 70% of the options to vest; and
    10 million for 100% of the options to vest.
In addition, on a listing of the shares on AIM 50% of the unvested 
options at that time vested. In the event of a sale of the company, 
the purchaser can choose to replace options with equivalent 
options or they will vest.
The performance criteria for options granted in 2006 are that:
    50% of the options vest on a loss before interest and tax for  
the year to 31.12.06 of less than  480,000; and
    50% of the options vest on a profit before interest and tax for 
the year to 31.12.07 of greater than  550,000.
