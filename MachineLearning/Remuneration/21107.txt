 Annual Report & Accounts 2007 22 Axeon Holdings plc 
The Remuneration and Nominations Committee is responsible 
for determining, within agreed terms of reference, the policy 
for the remuneration of the executive directors. The committee 
is also responsible for determining the individual remuneration 
packages for executive directors including basic salary and 
annual bonuses, the level and terms of grants of options and 
awards and the terms of any performance conditions to apply  
to the exercise of such options and awards, pension rights  
and other benefits. When appropriate, the committee will  
also make recommendations in relation to the remuneration  
of senior management.
The Remuneration Committee consists of independent 
non-executive directors. The Chairman of the committee is 
Lawrence Berns and the other members are Charles Matthews,

the independent non-executive directors are able to offer a 
balanced view with respect to remuneration issues of the group. 
The committee has access to independent advice from external 
advisers who do not have any connection with the company 
or group, and draws on independent salary data for AIM 
companies. The committee consults with the Chief Executive 
Officer on the remuneration of the other executive directors.  
The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer 
normally attend part of the Remuneration Committee meetings. 
No director is involved in approving their own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide 
remuneration in a form and amount that will attract, retain, 
motivate and reward high calibre directors and senior 
management. The committee believes that base salary and 
benefits for executive directors should form a fair return for the 
employment, but that over time a substantial part of the total 
rewards should be derived from performance-related elements 
of the remuneration package. The performance-related 
elements of the executive directors' packages seek to align  
their interests closely with those of the shareholders and  
provide incentives for performance.
Executive directors' employment contracts
The executive directors' employment contracts are continuing 
contracts subject to termination on a maximum of 6 months 
written notice by the company. There are no provisions for 
compensation on early termination in any of the executive 
directors' employment contracts.
Executive directors' remuneration packages
Details of individual executive directors' remuneration are 
included in the table on the next page. Remuneration packages 
for executive directors consist of the following elements:
Fixed elements
Base salary and benefits - The committee reviews base 
salaries annually taking account of relevant external market 
comparisons, the level of responsibility for each executive and 
movements in basic pay across the group. Executive directors 
can also benefit from the Axeon Group Life Assurance Scheme

of the financial and operational targets established at the 
beginning of the financial year .
Share option plans
The company operates the Axeon approved and unapproved 
share option schemes, details of which are given on page 23. 
Under the schemes, options over the company's ordinary shares 
may be granted to all employees, including executive directors. 
Exercise of options granted under the approved and unapproved 
schemes are subject to performance criteria which are detailed 
on page 24. The information on grants is set out on page 23.
Non-executive directors' remuneration
The remuneration of non-executive directors is established by 
the board within the limits set out in the Articles of Association. 
The non-executive directors may also be awarded share options 
under separate non approved standalone agreements, but are 
not eligible for bonuses and do not receive any other benefits  
or rights under the pension scheme.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts. 
However, they each have a letter of appointment which contains 
a notice period of three months. The letters of appointment  
set out the expected time commitment for non-executives.  
Any other significant commitments are disclosed to the board 
and significant changes brought to the board's attention.  
Non-executive directors are not appointed for specific terms  
but are subject to re-election by shareholders every three or four 
years under the rotation provisions contained in the company's 
Articles of Association.

of the directors upon recommendation by the Remuneration
