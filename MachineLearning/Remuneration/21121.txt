Annual Report 2006 
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for making 
recommendations to the Board on the Group's general policy 
on remuneration and also determines specific packages for 
individual directors.
The members of the Committee throughout the majority of the 
year year were Christopher Rogers, Chairman, and George Canvin. 
Neither of them had any personal financial interest in any matters 
to be decided by the Committee (other than as disclosed). There 
was one meeting of the Committee during the year. Mr Rogers 
resigned from the Board and the Committee in December 2006 
and upon Mr Rogers' resignation, Mr Canvin became Chairman 
of the Committee and Stephen Ball joined the Committee. It is 
the Board's intention that when a further non executive joins the 
Board he will be appointed to the Committee.
Policy on Executive Directors' remuneration
The policy of the board is to provide executive remuneration 
packages designed to attract, motivate and retain directors. The 
Board recognises that directors' remuneration is a legitimate 
concern to shareholders and on that basis ensures that the 
remuneration reflects the director's responsibilities and contains 
incentives to deliver the Group's objectives, but is linked to the 
performance of the Group against its forecasts and shareholder 
expectations.
The Remuneration Committee consults the Executive Chairman 
about the proposals relating to executive directors and has access 
to professional advice inside and outside the Group.
There are three elements of executive remuneration:
basic salary
annual performance related bonus
share option incentives
Basic salary
Appropriate levels of remuneration are decided by combining 
the analysis of rates of pay for similar positions in comparable 
companies with the individual and Group performance. The 
Committee may also seek independent professional advice when 
appropriate.
Annual performance related bonus
An annual performance-related bonus is payable in each 
financial year to executive directors of the Company provided 
the objectives established by the Remuneration Committee 
are met. No bonuses have been awarded in the year ended 
31 December 2006.
 
 
 
Share options
No share options were granted to any members of the Board 
during the year ended 31 December 2006.
Executive Directors' contracts
It is the Company's policy that executive directors should have 
contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of 
one year's notice.
The relevant details of the service contracts or contracts for 
services of the current executive directors are summarised in
