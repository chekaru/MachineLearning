Report of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for making 
recommendations to the Board on the Group's general policy 
on remuneration and also determines specific packages for 
individual directors.
The members of the Committee throughout the year were 
George Canvin, the Chairman, and Stephen Ball. George Canvin 
did not have any personal financial interest in any matters to 
be decided by the Committee, and Stephen Balls' have been 
disclosed in the Notes to the Financial Statements. There 
were four meetings of the Committee during the year and the 
Committee also passed one written resolution. It is the Board's 
intention that when Stephen Dexter joins the Board in May 2008 
he will be appointed to the Committee in place of Stephen Ball.
Policy on Executive Directors' remuneration
The policy of the board is to provide executive remuneration 
packages designed to attract, motivate and retain directors. The 
Board recognises that directors' remuneration is a legitimate concern 
to shareholders and on that basis ensures that the remuneration 
reflects the director's responsibilities and contains incentives to 
deliver the Group's objectives, but is linked to the performance of 
the Group against its forecasts and shareholder expectations.
The Remuneration Committee consults the Executive Chairman 
about the proposals relating to executive directors and has 
access to professional advice inside and outside the Group.
There are three elements of executive remuneration:
 	 basic	salar y;
 	 ann ual	perf or mance	related	bon us;
 	 share	option	incentiv es.
Basic salary
Appropriate levels of remuneration are decided by combining 
the analysis of rates of pay for similar positions in comparable 
companies with the individual and Group performance. The 
Committee may also seek independent professional advice 
when appropriate.
Annual performance related bonus
An annual performance-related bonus is payable in each 
financial year to executive directors of the Group provided 
the objectives established by the Remuneration Committee 
are met. No bonuses have been awarded in the year ended 
31 December 2007.
Share options
On 18 May 2007 Heiner Mangels was granted an option to 
acquire 100,000 shares in the Company pursuant to the 
non-Inland Revenue approved Schedule to the Group's Share 
Option Scheme. Details of such grants are set out below under 
Directors' Interests. 
Executive Directors' contracts
It is the Group's policy that executive directors should have 
contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of 
one year's notice.
The relevant details of the service contracts or contracts for 
services of the current executive directors are summarised 
in the table below. None of the contracts provide for specific 
compensation in the event of early termination.

notice. There are no provisions for specific compensation in
