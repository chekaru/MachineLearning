Annual Report and Accounts 2002
Remuneration Report
Introduction
All matters relating to executive remuneration are determined by the Compensation Committee, a sub-committee of the Board
of Directors. However, the directors believe that the concept of a unitary board is important, and hence include this report on
Executive Remuneration as an integral element of the overall Report and Accounts.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which introduced new
statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors' remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the
Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors' remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a
resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial
statements will be approved. The Company has voluntarily adopted the same practice for the last three years.
Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee, which consists of the Chairman and the other three non-executive directors of the Company,
Gordon McAndrew, Tarald Glastad, and Erik Hornnaess, meets several times per year. As appropriate, the Committee may 
invite the Chief Executive Officer to participate in some of its discussions. The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the
Committee. No director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration. The Committee is responsible for
determining the terms and conditions of employment of executive directors. It is also responsible for considering management
recommendations for remuneration and employment terms of the Company's staff, including incentive arrangements for bonus
payments and grant of share options.
The Compensation Committee's decisions are made on the basis of rewarding individuals for the nature of jobs they undertake
and their performance therein. Proper regard is given to the need to attract and retain high quality, well-motivated staff at all
levels, to the remuneration being paid by similar companies, and to the fact that as a Scottish-Norwegian organisation there are
additional factors to be taken into account. The Committee receives advice from independent remuneration consultants and
takes into account the remuneration paid by companies of similar size, by other companies in the life-sciences sector and by
other locally based companies. In 2002 the Committee appointed New Bridge Street Consultants to provide advice on
structuring directors' remuneration packages. New Bridge Consultants did not provide any other services to the Company
in 2002.
Details of Remuneration
The remuneration of directors is set out in detail in the table below. The Company's Compensation Committee decides the
remuneration policy that applies to executive directors and the Group's other senior management.
Each of the executive directors has a one-year rolling contract. In the event the Company is acquired all of the executive
directors' contracts can be terminated in the following 12 months by the Company giving them not less than 24 months notice.
The most recent executed contracts for each executive director are as follows: Mr S W F Lien - 27 May 1999, Mr P M Garvey - 
6 May 2000, Mr E M H Sundrehagen - 18 May 1999 and Mr I D Gilham - 1 November 2001. In the event of termination the
executive directors would be entitled to loss of salary, benefits and pensionable service for the notice periods. The appointments
of non-executive directors of the Company are terminable with three months notice.
The Company's policy is that a significant proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be performance
related. As described below, executive directors may earn annual incentive payments together with the benefits of participation
in Share Option Schemes.
Constituent Elements of Remuneration Package
In applying the above principles to the determination of executive director remuneration, the Compensation Committee gives
consideration to several components which together comprise the total remuneration package; these consist of the following:
  Basic Salary is determined by the Committee at the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or
responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the position in the Group, personal and Company
performance and relies on objective research which gives up-to-date information on a comparable group of companies.
Basic salaries were last reviewed in January 2003, with increases taking effect from 1 January 2003. The next review will take
place in January 2004. Executive directors' contracts of service, which include details of remuneration, will be available for
inspection at the Annual General Meeting. Axis-Shield plc

Remuneration Report continued
  Annual Bonus is paid provided that objectives established by the Committee are met for each financial year. The objectives in
2002 included superior performance against budgeted group EBITDA and cash flow, the Company's performance against the
FTSE Techmark Mediscience Index and progress against business development and research and development objectives. The
bonus payable was subject to a maximum of 50%. For 2003 the objectives are similar but have more emphasis on the areas
which each of the executive directors can directly influence. The bonus payment is subject to a maximum of 60%. An
additional special bonus, subject to a maximum of  35,000, is payable to the Chief Executive Officer, Mr Lien, based upon
achievement of specific objectives. In 2002 these objectives related to research and development investment and additional
revenue generators. The objectives for 2003 are similar.
  Benefits in Kind which comprise company car and running costs, private healthcare and critical illness/death in service cover
and ex-patriate packages where appropriate.
  Pension Contribution. The Group operates a contracted-out defined contribution scheme for executive directors whereby
the Group contributes 12% of a director's gross salary or, should the director so elect, the contributions can be made into a
director's personal pension scheme. Under a flexible benefits policy, individual directors can forego other benefits in return for
equivalent increases in Company contribution. No pension contribution is payable on the annual bonus. During the year, four
of the directors had personal pensions to which the Company contributed.
  Share Options. The Group believes there is benefit to be gained from aligning executive directors' interests (and other
employee interests) with those of shareholders by means of share options. Axis-Shield operates four option schemes - the
Approved Scheme, the Medium Term Share Option Scheme, the Matching Shares Scheme and the Sharesave Scheme - details
of which are given in the Directors' Report. The award of options is wholly at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.
Non-Executive Remuneration
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is agreed by the Group Board taking into account a number of factors
pertinent to their position and role as non-executive directors.

Share Options Granted to Directors
The Company operates an Inland Revenue approved and an unapproved share option scheme to reward employees'
performance and to incentivise at all levels. Exercise is subject to performance conditions. For all options granted under the
Medium Term Scheme to date, the exercise criterion has been that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation
(EBITDA) must be positive for at least the two financial years immediately prior to exercise and EBITDA per share, once positive,
should achieve growth which exceeds the percentage growth in the Retail Price Index by 4% or more. In addition, the growth 
in the Company's share price between date of grant and at least one day during the option period must put it in the top third 
of companies which comprise the All Share Health Index. The rules of the schemes conform to institutional investor guidelines
on dilution.
The performance criterion, which applies to all executive directors to whom options have been granted under the Scheme, was
chosen as it requires significant improvement in financial performance. Axis-Shield plc

Performance Graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance measured by the total shareholders return, compared with the
performance of the FTSE All Share Health Index and for 2002 only, the FTSE Techmark Mediscience Index, also measured by total
shareholder return. The FTSE All Share Health Index has been selected for this comparison because up until 2002 it provided the
best measure of performance of companies operating in the same sector as the Group. Since 2002 the Techmark Mediscience
Index provided a more appropriate measure of that performance. The FTSE Techmark Mediscience Index only commenced in
November 2001. Until we have five years of comparative performance for this index we will show performance against it and the
FTSE All Share Health Index.
Options to acquire shares in the Company, granted to directors under the Medium Term Scheme, but not exercised,
