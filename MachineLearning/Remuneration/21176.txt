Remuneration Report
Introduction
All matters relating to executive remuneration are determined by the Compensation Committee, a committee of the Board of
Directors. However, the directors believe that the concept of a unitary board is important, and hence include this report on
remuneration as an integral element of the overall Report and Accounts.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which introduced new
statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors' remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the 
Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors' remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a 
resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements
will be approved. Prior to these Regulations having been introduced the Company had voluntarily adopted the same practice for the
previous three years.
Compensation Committee
The Committee is responsible for determining the terms and conditions of employment of executive directors. It is also responsible 
for considering management recommendations for remuneration and employment terms of the Company's staff, including incentive
arrangements for bonus payments and grant of share options. The written terms of reference are available from the Company on
request and will be on display at the Annual General Meeting.
During 2003 the Compensation Committee consisted of the Chairman and the other three non-executive directors of the Company,
Gordon McAndrew, Tarald Glastad and Erik Hornnaess and met twice. In line with the provisions of the Revised Combined Code,
on 1 January 2004, Gordon McAndrew and Tarald Glastad stepped down from the Committee. On 22 January 2004, Linda McGoldrick,
having been appointed a non-executive director of the Company, was appointed to the Committee. The Company Secretary acts as
secretary to the Committee. No director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
Remuneration Policy
The Compensation Committee has established a policy on the remuneration of executive directors and the Board has established 
a policy for non-executive directors for the current and subsequent years.
Executives
In 2002 the Committee appointed New Bridge Street Consultants to provide advice on structuring directors' remuneration packages.
New Bridge Street Consultants reported to the Committee in early 2003 but did not provide any other services to the Company in
2003. The advice takes into account the remuneration paid by companies of similar size, by other companies in the life-sciences sector 
and by other locally-based companies. As appropriate, the Committee may invite the Chief Executive Officer to participate in some 
of its discussions.
The Compensation Committee's decisions are made on the basis of rewarding individuals for the nature of jobs they undertake and 
their performance therein. Proper regard is given to the need to attract and retain high quality, well-motivated staff at all levels, and 
to the remuneration being paid by similar companies, and to the fact that as a Scottish-Norwegian organisation there are additional
factors to be taken into account.
The Company's policy is that a significant proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be performance-related.
As described below, executive directors may earn annual incentive payments together with the benefits of participation in Share 
Option Schemes.
Contracts
Each of the executive directors have agreed to a one-year rolling contract. The arrangements for the executive directors which
provided additional compensation in the event of a change of control of Axis-Shield (which were disclosed in the 2002 Annual Report
and Accounts) have been terminated with effect from 31 March 2004. The most recent executed contracts for each executive director 
are as follows: Mr S W F Lien - 27 May 1999, Mr P M Garvey - 6 May 2000, Dr E M H Sundrehagen - 18 May 1999, Dr I D Gilham - 
1 November 2001 and Mr O Steinnes - 31 March 2004. In the event of termination the executive directors would be entitled to loss 
of salary, benefits and pensionable service for the notice periods.
The executive directors' service contracts will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Non-Executive Directors
The Group policy is to establish and maintain a body of non-executive directors with a breadth of international skills and experience
that is relevant to the Group's business. In this context, it is the Board's policy for the non-executive directors to be paid a level of fee
that reflects market condition and is sufficient to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience. Axis-Shield plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 www.axis-shield.com
Page 17 Remuneration Report
The Chairman Nigel Keen has a letter of appointment for a three year term to September 2004. The appointment may be terminated
by either party giving not less than six months notice. The non-executive directors have a letter of appointment for a term of three
years which may be terminated by either party without notice.
Details of Remuneration
The remuneration of the directors is set out in detail in the tables below. The Compensation Committee decides the remuneration
that applies to executive directors and the Group's other senior management and the Board sets the level of fees for the Chairman 
and the non-executive directors.
Executive Director Remuneration Package
In applying the above principles to the determination of executive director remuneration, the Compensation Committee gives
consideration to several components which together comprise the total remuneration package; these consist of the following:
 Basic Salary is determined by the Committee at the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or
responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the position in the Group, personal and Company
performance and relies on objective research which gives up-to-date information on a comparable group of companies. Basic
salaries were last reviewed in February 2004, with increases taking effect from 1 January 2004. The next review will take place 
in January 2005.
 Annual Performance Incentives are paid provided that objectives established by the Committee are met for each financial year.
The objectives in 2003 included superior performance against budgeted group EBITDA and cash flow, the Company's performance
against the FTSE Techmark Mediscience Index and progress against business development areas which each individual executive 
could directly influence, and research and development objectives. The bonus payable was subject to a maximum of 60% of basic
salary. For 2004 the objectives are similar but have more emphasis on budgeted results before tax. The bonus payment continues to
be subject to a maximum of 60% of basic salary. An additional special bonus, subject to a maximum of   35,000, is payable to the
Chief Executive Officer, Mr Lien, based upon achievement of specific objectives. In 2003 these objectives related to company
reorganisation and additional revenue generators. The objectives for 2004 include achievement of AFINION  related-targets.
 Benefits in Kind which comprise company car and running costs, private healthcare and critical illness/death in service cover and 
ex-patriate packages where appropriate.
 Pension Contribution. The Group operates a contracted-out defined contribution scheme for executive directors whereby the
Group contributes 12% of a director's gross salary or, should the director so elect, the contributions can be made into a director's
personal pension scheme. Under a flexible benefits policy, individual directors can forego other benefits in return for equivalent
increases in Company contribution. No pension contribution is payable on the annual bonus. During the year, four of the directors
had personal pensions to which the Company contributed.

Long Term Incentive Plans
The Group believes there is benefit to be gained from aligning executive directors' interests (and other employee interests) with those
of shareholders by means of share options. Axis-Shield operates four share option schemes - the Approved Scheme, the Medium
Share Option Scheme, the Matching Shares Scheme and the Sharesave Scheme - details of which are given in the Directors' Report.
The award of options is wholly at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.
Share Options Granted to Directors (audited)
The Group operates an Inland Revenue approved and an unapproved share option scheme to reward employees' performance and to
incentivise at all levels. Exercise is subject to performance conditions. For all options granted under the Medium Term Scheme to date,
the exercise criterion has been that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) must be positive for at least
the two financial years immediately prior to exercise and EBITDA per share, once positive, should achieve growth which exceeds the
percentage growth in the Retail Price Index by 4% or more. In addition, the growth in the Company's share price between date of
grant and at least one day during the option period must put it in the top third of companies which comprise the All Share Health
Index. The rules of the schemes conform to institutional investor guidelines on dilution. The performance criterion, which applies to
all executive directors to whom options have been granted under the Scheme, was chosen as it requires significant improvement in
financial performance.
Options to acquire shares in the Company, granted to directors under the Medium Term Scheme, but not exercised, as at 31
December 2003 are:

Chairman
Under an arrangement between the Company and Imperialise Limited Nigel Keen is retained to act as Chairman of the Company.
Mr Keen's fees are currently  47,500 which includes fees of  2,500 p.a. for chairmanship of the Compensation Committee. In addition,
since 1 January 2004, Imperialise Limited is paid a sum equivalent to the National Insurance on those fees at the rate of   6,080 p.a.
Non-Executive Directors
The non-executive directors are paid an annual fee of  20,000. Gordon McAndrew's fees include a fee of  2,500 p.a. for chairmanship 
of the Audit Committee. The Chairman and the non-executive directors do not receive any other benefits. T A Glastad waived
entitlement to his fees in respect of his non-executive directorship for the six months to June 2002.
Performance Graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance measured by the total shareholders return, compared with the performance 
of the FTSE All Share Health Index and for 2002 and 2003 only, the FTSE Techmark Mediscience Index, also measured by total shareholder
return. The FTSE All Share Health Index has been selected for this comparison because up until 2002 it provided the best measure of
performance of companies operating in the same sector as the Group. Since 2002 the Techmark Mediscience Index provided a more
appropriate measure of that performance. The FTSE Techmark Mediscience Index only commenced in November 2001. Until we have five
years of comparative performance for this index we will continue to show performance against it and the FTSE All Share Health Index.
