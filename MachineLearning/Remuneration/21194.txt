 18 AXIS-SHIELD PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2004
Remuneration Report
Introduction
All matters relating to executive remuneration are determined by the Compensation Committee, a committee of the Board of Directors.
However, the directors believe that the concept of a unitary Board is important, and hence include this report on remuneration as an integral
element of the overall Report and Accounts.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, which introduced new statutory
requirements for the disclosure of directors' remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002. The report also meets
the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of
Good Governance relating to directors' remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at
the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved. Prior to these Regulations having been
introduced the Company had voluntarily adopted the same practice for the previous three years. Certain items in the Remuneration Report
require to be audited and are identified as such against the relevant heading.
Compensation Committee
The Board considers the Chairman of the Board should be a member of the Compensation Committee as it is essential that the Chairman be
involved in the work of the Committee and, in particular, the setting of the executive directors' remuneration. During 2004 the
Compensation Committee consisted of the Chairman and the two independent non-executive directors of the Company, Erik Hornnaess, 
and Linda McGoldrick who, having been appointed a non-executive director of the Company on 22 January 2004, was appointed to the
Committee. The Compensation Committee is required to meet at least twice a year and at such other times as the Chairman of the Committee
shall require. During 2004 it met on two occasions and all its members were present for each meeting. On 3 March 2005 Bay Green, having
been appointed a non-executive director of the Company, was appointed to the Committee.
The Committee is responsible for determining the remuneration of the executive directors, together with their terms and conditions of
employment. It is also responsible for considering management recommendations for remuneration and employment terms of the
Company's staff, including incentive arrangements for bonus payments and grant of share options. The Committee is consulted on, and
notified of, all senior management appointments and related remuneration. The written Terms of Reference are available from the Company
on request and will be on display at the Annual General Meeting.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships
or day-to-day involvement in running the business. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board and other directors attend
meetings when invited by the Committee. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee and no director plays a part in any
discussion about his or her own remuneration.
Remuneration Policy
The Compensation Committee has established a policy on the remuneration of executive directors and the Board has established a policy for
non-executive directors for the current and subsequent years. 
Executives
In 2004 the Committee appointed New Bridge Street Consultants to provide further advice on structuring directors' remuneration packages.
New Bridge Street Consultants had previously been appointed in 2002 for similar advice. New Bridge Street Consultants reported to the
Committee in early 2005 but did not provide any other services to the Company in 2004. The advice takes into account the remuneration
paid by a group of fifty companies from all sectors, excluding the financial sector, with Axis-Shield plc ranked at median in terms of market
capitalisation range and a specific group of eighteen TechMark MediScience companies. 
The Compensation Committee's decisions are made on the basis of rewarding individuals for the nature of jobs they undertake and their
performance according to defined objectives to deliver our strategy. Proper regard is given to the need to attract and retain high quality,
well-motivated staff at all levels, and to the remuneration being paid by similar companies, and to the fact that, as a Scottish-Norwegian
organisation, there are additional factors to be taken into account. 
The Company's policy is that a significant proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be performance-related. As
described below, executive directors may earn annual incentive payments, together with the benefits of participation in Share Option
Schemes.
Contracts
Each of the executive directors has agreed to a one-year rolling contract. The arrangements for the executive directors which provided
additional compensation in the event of a change of control of Axis-Shield (which were disclosed in the 2002 Annual Report and Accounts)
were terminated with effect from 31 March 2004. The most recent executed contracts for each executive director are as follows: 
Mr S W F Lien - 31 March 2005, Mr P M Garvey - 25 February 2005, Dr E M H Sundrehagen - 1 March 2005, Dr I D Gilham - 25 February 2005
and Mr O Steinnes - 31 March 2005. In the event of termination the executive directors would be entitled to loss of salary, proportional
bonus, benefits and pensionable service for the notice periods, subject to mitigation where appropriate.
The executive directors' service contracts will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2004 AXIS-SHIELD PLC            19
Executive directors are entitled to accept non-executive appointments outside the Company, providing the Chairman's permission is
obtained. The Compensation Committee decides whether any fees are retained by the director. 
Non-Executive Directors
The Group Policy is to establish and maintain a body of non-executive directors with a breadth of international skills and experience that is
relevant to the Group's business. In this context, it is the Board's policy for the non-executive directors to be paid a level of fee that reflects
market conditions and is sufficient to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience. A review of this level of fee will be
carried out in the second quarter of 2005.
The Chairman, Nigel Keen, has a letter of appointment for a three year term to September 2007. The appointment may be terminated by
either party giving not less than six months' notice. The non-executive directors have a letter of appointment for a term of three years which
may be terminated by either party without notice.
Details of Remuneration
The remuneration of directors is set out in detail in the table below. The Compensation Committee decides the remuneration that applies to
the executive directors and the Group's other senior management and the Board sets the level of fees for the non-executive directors.
Executive Director Remuneration Package
In applying the above principles to the determination of executive director remuneration, the Compensation Committee gives consideration
to several components which together comprise the total remuneration package. These consist of the following:
  Basic Salary is determined by the Committee at the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or responsibility. 
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the position in the Group, personal and Company performance and relies on
objective research which gives up-to-date information on a comparable group of companies. Basic salaries were last reviewed in 
February 2005, with increases taking effect from 1 January 2005. The next review will take place in January 2006.
  Annual Performance Incentives are paid provided that objectives established by the Committee are met for each financial year. The
objectives in 2004 included superior performance against budgeted group profit before tax, divisional profit before tax and Group cash
flow, the Company's performance against the FTSE TechMark MediScience Index and progress against business development areas which
each individual executive could directly influence, and research and development objectives. The bonus payable was subject to a
maximum of 60% of basic salary. For 2005 the objectives again put emphasis on superior performance against budgeted profit before 
tax and the Company's relative share price performance, while the business development areas are very much focused on the AFINION 
and AxSYM
 
xtra product areas. The bonus payment continues to be subject to a maximum of 60% of basic salary. An additional special
bonus, subject to a maximum of  35,000, is payable to the Chief Executive Officer, Mr Lien, based upon achievement of specific objectives.
In 2004 these objectives related to incremental revenues and progress on AFINION  distribution networks. The objectives for 2005 are
entirely related to the successful implementation of the US strategy for AFINION .
  Benefits in Kind, which comprise company car and running costs, private health and disability insurance and critical illness/death in 
service cover.
  Pension Contribution. The Group operates a contracted-out defined contribution scheme for executive directors whereby the Group
contributes 12% of a director's gross salary or, should the director so elect, the contributions can be made into a director's personal
pension scheme. Under a flexible benefits policy, individual directors can forego other benefits in return for equivalent increases in
Company contribution. No pension contribution is payable on the annual bonus. During the year, five of the directors had personal
pensions to which the Company contributed. Two of the executive directors who are tax-resident in Norway divert a proportion of the
Company's contribution towards the defined benefit scheme run by the Norwegian subsidiaries, as outlined in Note 19 to the Accounts.
From 1 January 2005 the Group will contribute 15% of a director's gross salary, provided that the individual contributes an additional 3%. 20 AXIS-SHIELD PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2004

respectively.
Long Term Incentive Plans
The Group believes there is benefit to be gained from aligning executive directors' interests (and other employee interests) with those of
shareholders by means of share options. Axis-Shield operates four option schemes - the Approved Scheme, the Medium Term Share Option
Scheme, the Matching Shares Scheme and the Sharesave Schemes. Details of the Sharesave Schemes and the Medium Term Share Option
Scheme are given in the Directors' Report. The Approved Scheme is currently inactive, while the Matching Shares Scheme has not been used
to date. The award of options is wholly at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. 
Share Options Granted to Directors (audited)
The Company operates an Inland Revenue approved and an unapproved share option scheme to reward employees' performance and to
incentivise at all levels. Exercise is subject to performance conditions. For all options granted under the Medium Term Scheme to date, the
exercise criterion has been that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) must be positive for at least the two
financial years immediately prior to exercise and EBITDA per share, once positive, should achieve growth which exceeds the percentage
growth in the Retail Price Index by 4% or more. In addition, the growth in the Company's share price between date of grant and at least one
day during the option period must put it in the top third of companies which comprise the All Share Health Index. The rules of the schemes
conform to institutional investor guidelines on dilution.
The performance criterion, which applies to all executive directors to whom options have been granted under the Scheme, was chosen as it
requires significant improvement in financial performance. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2004 AXIS-SHIELD PLC         21

Chairman
Under an arrangement between the Company and Imperialise Limited, Nigel Keen is retained to act as Chairman of the Company. Mr Keen's
fees are currently  47,500 which includes a fee of  2,500 p.a. for Chairmanship of the Compensation Committee. In addition, since
1 January 2004, Imperialise Limited is paid a sum equivalent to the National Insurance on those fees at the rate of  6,080 p.a. 
Non-Executive Directors
The non-executive directors are paid an annual fee of  20,000. Gordon McAndrew's fees include a fee of  2,500 p.a. for Chairmanship of
the Audit Committee. The Chairman and the non-executive directors do not receive any other benefits. 
Performance Graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance measured by the total shareholders' return, compared with the performance of the
FTSE All Share Health Index and for 2002 to 2004 only, the FTSE Techmark Mediscience Index, also measured by total shareholders' return. 
The FTSE All Share Health Index has been selected for this comparison because up until 2002 it provided the best measure of performance of
companies operating in the same sector as the Group. Since 2002 the Techmark Mediscience Index has provided a more appropriate measure
of that performance. The FTSE Techmark Mediscience Index only commenced in November 2001. Until we have five years of comparative
performance for this index we will show performance against it and the FTSE All Share Health Index.
