IntroductIon
All matters relating to executive remuneration are determined by the Compensation Committee, a committee of the Board of 
Directors. However, the directors believe that the concept of a unitary board is important, and hence include this report on 
remuneration as an integral element of the overall Report and Accounts. 
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, which introduced new 
statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors' remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002. The 
report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board 
has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors' remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to 
approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be 
approved. Certain items in the Remuneration Report require to be audited and are identified as such against the relevant heading.
comPensatIon commIttee
The Board considers the Chairman of the Board should be a member of the Compensation Committee as it is essential that the 
Chairman be involved in the work of the Committee and, in particular, the setting of the executive directors' remuneration. During 
2005 the Compensation Committee consisted of the following non-executive directors - Nigel Keen, Chairman, Erik Hornnaess, 
Senior Independent Director, Linda McGoldrick and, from the date of his appointment, Bay Green. The Compensation Committee 
is required to meet at least twice a year and at such other times as the Chairman of the Committee shall require. During 2005 it met 
on two occasions. At its first meeting, two of the three members were present. At the second meeting all four members (including 
Bay Green) were present. 
The Committee is responsible for determining the remuneration of the executive directors, together with their terms and conditions 
of employment. It is also responsible for considering management recommendations for remuneration and employment terms of 
the Company's staff, including incentive arrangements for bonus payments and grant of share options. The Committee is consulted 
on, and notified of, all senior management appointments and related remuneration. The written Terms of Reference are available 
from the Company on request and will be on display at the Annual General Meeting.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interest arising from cross-
directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board and other 
directors attend meetings when invited by the Committee. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee and no 
director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
remuneratIon PolIcy
The Compensation Committee has established a policy on the remuneration of executive directors and the Board has established  
a policy for non-executive directors for the current and subsequent years. 
executIves
In 2005 the Committee appointed New Bridge Street Consultants LLP to provide further advice on structuring directors' 
remuneration packages, together with a report on the proposals for a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP ). New Bridge Street 
Consultants LLP had previously been appointed in 2004 for similar advice. New Bridge Street Consultants LLP reported to the 
Committee in early 2006. The advice takes into account the remuneration paid by a group of fifty companies from all sectors, 
excluding the financial sector, with Axis-Shield plc ranked at median in terms of market capitalisation range and a specific group  
of fourteen TechMark MediScience companies. New Bridge Street Consultants LLP provide no other services to the Company.
 
The Compensation Committee's decisions are made on the basis of rewarding individuals for the nature of jobs they undertake and 
their performance according to defined objectives to deliver the Group's strategy. Proper regard is given to the need to attract and 
retain high quality, well-motivated staff at all levels, and to the remuneration being paid by similar companies, and to the fact that, 
as a Scottish-Norwegian organisation, there are additional factors to be taken into account. 
The Company's policy is that a significant proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be performance-related. 
Executive directors may earn annual incentive payments, together with the benefits of participation in Share Option Schemes.

servIce contracts
It is the Committee's policy to offer service contracts with a maximum of one year's notice and each of the executive directors' 
contracts has a one-year notice period. The most recent executed contracts for each executive director are as follows:  
Mr S W F Lien - 31 March 2005, Mr P M Garvey - 25 February 2005, Dr E M H Sundrehagen - 1 March 2005, Dr I D Gilham -  
25 February 2005 and Mr O Steinnes - 31 March 2005. In the event of termination the executive directors would be entitled to  
loss of salary, proportional bonus, benefits and pensionable service for the notice periods, subject to mitigation where appropriate.
The executive directors' service contracts will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Executive directors are entitled to accept non-executive appointments outside the Company, providing the Chairman's permission 
is obtained. The Compensation Committee decides whether any fees are retained by the director. 
non-executIve dIrectors
The Group policy is to establish and maintain a body of non-executive directors with a breadth of international skills and experience 
that is relevant to the Group's business. In this context, it is the Board's policy for the non-executive directors to be paid a level of 
fee that reflects market conditions and is sufficient to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience. A review of 
this level of fee was carried out during the second quarter of 2005 with revised fees applicable from 1 July 2005.
The Chairman, Nigel Keen, has a letter of appointment for a three year term to September 2007. The appointment may be 
terminated by either party giving not less than six months' notice. The non-executive directors have a letter of appointment for a 
term of three years which may be terminated by either party without notice.
detaIls of remuneratIon
The remuneration of directors is detailed in the accompanying table. The Compensation Committee decides the remuneration that 
applies to the executive directors and the Group's other senior management and the Board sets the level of fees for the  
non-executive directors.
executIve dIrector remuneratIon PackaGe
In applying the above principles to the determination of executive director remuneration, the Compensation Committee gives 
consideration to several components which together comprise the total remuneration package. These consist of the following:
    Basic Salary is determined by the Committee at the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or 
responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the position in the Group, personal and Company 
performance and relies on objective research which gives up-to-date information on a comparable group of companies.  
Basic salaries were last reviewed in February 2006, with increases taking effect from 1 January 2006. The next review will  
take place in January 2007.
    Annual Performance Incentives are paid provided that objectives established by the Committee are met for each financial year. 
For 2005 the objectives put emphasis on superior performance against budgeted profit before tax on a Group and Divisional 
basis and for the Chief Executive Officer and the Finance Director, the Company's relative share price performance, while the 
personal objectives were focused on the AFINION  and AxSYM
 
 xtra product areas, cash flow and, where appropriate, 
research and development objectives. Targets for the 2006 bonus will be broadly similar. The bonus payment continues to be 
subject to a maximum of 60% of basic salary. As in previous years, an additional special bonus, subject to a maximum of 
 35,000, is payable to the Chief Executive Officer, Mr Lien, based upon achievement of specific objectives. The objectives for 
2005 related entirely to progress on the AFINION  project.
    Benefits in Kind, which comprise Company car and running costs, private health and disability insurance and critical illness/
death in service cover.
    Pension Contribution. The Group operates a contracted-out defined contribution scheme for executive directors whereby the 
Group contributes 15% of a director's gross salary (subject to the director contributing 3% of gross salary) or, should the director 
so elect, the contributions can be paid to a director's personal pension scheme. Under a flexible benefits policy, individual 
directors can forego other benefits in return for equivalent increases in Company contribution. No pension contribution is payable 
on the annual bonus. During the year, five of the directors had personal pensions to which the Company contributed. Two of the 
executive directors who are tax-resident in Norway divert a proportion of the Company's contribution towards the defined benefit 
scheme run by the Norwegian subsidiaries, as outlined in Note 25 to the Accounts. 
With effect from 6 April 2006, the Group will contribute up to 25% of a director's gross salary, subject to the director contributing up 
to 12.5% of gross salary on a matching basis. This change has been made after consideration of base salary levels, total 
remuneration and market competitiveness generally.

long t erm Incentive Plans
The Group believes there is benefit to be gained from aligning executive directors' interests (and other employee interests) with 
those of shareholders by means of share-based long-term incentives. 
At the 2006 Annual General Meeting the Company is seeking shareholder approval to introduce a new share-based Long-Term 
Incentive Plan. If approval for this plan is given, the Committee does not intend to make further grants under the existing Option 
Schemes or Share Matching Plan, other than under the Sharesave schemes. Details of all outstanding options are shown in the 
Directors' Report.
The features of the plan are contained in the Annual General Meeting circular but, in summary, the policy for awards to executive 
directors in 2006 is as follows:
    It is the Committee's intention to make awards of Performance Shares worth 50% of salary to the executive directors in 2006.
    Dividends, should any be paid by the Company, will accrue on awards from the date of grant, payable on vesting to the extent 
that the shares ultimately vest.
    60% of an award will be subject to absolute EPS targets and 40% subject to TSR performance against the constituents of the 
FTSE Techmark Mediscience Index as at the date of grant. EPS and TSR were chosen as they provide a balanced incentive,  
as participants are encouraged to drive earnings growth as well as returns to shareholders.
    For awards in 2006, an EPS target will be set for the 2008 year end. The EPS target requires EPS of 13.5p for 30% of the EPS 
award to vest, with full vesting if an EPS of 18p is achieved. Pro rata vesting occurs between the threshold and maximum 
performance targets. 
    For the TSR element, 30% of the award vests if the Company is ranked median with full vesting if the Company is ranked  
at the upper quartile or above. Pro rata vesting occurs between the threshold and maximum performance targets. The TSR  
element is also underpinned with the requirement that the Company's absolute TSR must be positive for awards to vest at all. 
TSR performance will be averaged over the three months prior to the beginning and end of the performance period and it will  
be calculated by external advisers and verified by the Committee.
The Company is also introducing a shareholding guideline of 100% of salary for executive directors. 50% of net gains from share 
plans must be retained until the shareholding guideline is achieved.
Share incentive plans will be available for other executives as part of the proposals being put to shareholders.

Performance GraPh
The following graph shows the Company's performance measured by the total shareholder return, compared with the performance 
of the FTSE All Share Health Index and for 2002 to 2005 only, the FTSE Techmark Mediscience Index, also measured by total 
shareholder return. The FTSE All Share Health Index has been selected for this comparison because up until 2002 it provided the 
best measure of performance of companies operating in the same sector as the Group. Since 2002 the Techmark Mediscience 
Index provided a more appropriate measure of that performance. The FTSE Techmark Mediscience Index only commenced in 
November 2001. Until we have five years of comparative performance for this index we will show performance against it and the 
FTSE All Share Health Index.
