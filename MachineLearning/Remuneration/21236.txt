 INTRODUCTION
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985. The report also meets the relevant 
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating  
to directors' remuneration. As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting  
of the Company at which the financial statements are presented. 
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Group's members on certain parts of the Directors' Remuneration Report and to state 
whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. This report 
contains unaudited and audited information. 
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Compensation Committee
The Group has a Compensation Committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code 
with the exception that the Chairman of the Board also serves as Compensation Committee Chairman. The Board considers this to 
be appropriate because it is essential that the Chairman be involved in the work of the Committee and, in particular, the setting of the 
executive directors' remuneration. 
The members of the Committee during 2006 were Nigel Keen (Chairman), Erik Hornnaess, Linda McGoldrick, Bay Green and, from the 
date of his appointment during 2006, Staffan Ek. 
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interest from cross-directorships  
or day-to-day involvement in running the business. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board. No director plays a part in 
any discussion about his or her own remuneration. 
In determining the directors' remuneration for the year, the Committee consulted Mr Svein Lien (Chief Executive Officer) about its 
proposals. The Committee also took advice from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP on the structure of directors' remuneration 
packages, including proposals for the Long Term Incentive Plan approved by shareholders at the 2006 Annual General Meeting. 
REMUNERATION pOLICY
The Compensation Committee has established a policy on the remuneration of executive directors and the Board has established  
a policy for non-executive directors for the current and subsequent years. 
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the high calibre needed 
to maintain the Group's position as a market leader and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The performance 
measurement of the executive directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration 
package are undertaken by the Committee.
Directors' remuneration packages comprise:
  Basic annual salary
  Benefits-in-kind
  Annual bonus payments (maximum 60%-75% of salary)
  Share incentive plans 
  Pension arrangements. 
The Group's policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be performance-related. 
Executive directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Group, provided that the Chairman's prior permission is sought, 
and are entitled to retain fees payable from such appointments. 
REMUNERATION
Basic salary
An executive director's basic salary is reviewed by the Committee at the beginning of each year and when an individual changes 
position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the position in the Group, personal and Group 
performance and relies on objective research which gives up-to-date information on a comparable group of companies. Basic salaries 
were last reviewed in March 2007, with increases taking effect from January 2007. The next review will take place in January 2008. 
Benefits-in-kind
Benefits-in-kind comprise company car and running costs, private health and disability insurance and critical illness/death-in-service cover. 
Directors' Remuneration Report
22  I  Axis-Shield Annual Report 2006 Annual bonus payments
At the start of each financial year the Committee agrees specific objectives for each executive director. Following the end of each financial 
year, the Committee determines the performance-related annual cash bonus for each executive director for the year just ended. This is 
based on the director's performance in achieving the objectives agreed. These comprise both financial and non-financial objectives. 
For 2006 the objectives put emphasis on superior performance against budgeted profit before tax on a Group and Divisional basis 
and for the Chief Executive Officer and the Finance Director, the Group's relative share price performance. Personal objectives were 
focused on the Afinion  and AxSYM
 
 xtra product areas, cash flow and, where appropriate, research and development objectives. 
Targets for the 2007 bonus will be broadly similar. The bonus payment continues to be subject to a maximum of 60% of basic salary 
for executive directors other than the CEO. For the CEO the maximum bonus payment is increased to 75% from 2007. Up to 2006, 
an additional special bonus, subject to a maximum of  35,000, was payable to the Chief Executive Officer, Mr Lien, based upon 
achievement of specific objectives. The objectives for 2006 related to progress on Afinion  products in the US and the development 
of the Group's medium-term strategic plan. Objectives for 2007 will be similar to those set in 2006.
pension arrangements
The Group operates a contracted-out defined contribution scheme for executive directors. During the first quarter of 2006, the Group 
contributed 15% of a director's gross salary, subject to the director contributing 3% of gross salary. With effect from 6 April 2006 
the Group contributed up to 25% of a director's gross salary, subject to the director contributing up to 12.5% of gross salary on a 
matching basis. If preferred, the contributions can be paid to a director's personal pension scheme.
Under a flexible benefits arrangement, individual directors can forego other benefits in return for equivalent increases in pension fund 
provision to which the Group contributes. No pension contribution is payable on the annual bonus. During the year, all of the executive 
directors had personal pensions to which the Group contributed. Two of the executive directors, who are tax-resident in Norway,  
divert a proportion of the Group's pension contribution towards the defined benefit scheme run by the Norwegian subsidiaries,  
as outlined in note 26 of the Accounts.

Axis-Shield Annual Report 2006  I  23 Long Term Incentive plan (audited)
A new Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP ) was approved at the 2006 Annual General Meeting. This scheme is intended to incentivise 
the Group's senior management to create shareholder value whilst retaining due focus on the underlying financial performance of the 
Group and to more closely align the interests of the Group's managers with those of the Group's shareholders.
Under the LTIP , conditional awards of shares can be granted to selected employees, including the executive directors, at the discretion 
of the Compensation Committee. The maximum value of shares awarded to a participant under the LTIP in relation to any financial year 
is limited to 75% of the individual's basic salary (150% in exceptional circumstances). 
Two different forms of award can be granted under the LTIP: Performance Awards'', the vesting of which are generally conditional on 
both continued employment over the period of three years from grant and on the extent to which stringent performance conditions are 
satisfied over a pre-determined performance period; and Retention Awards'', the vesting of which are solely dependent on continued 
employment. However, no Retention Awards can be granted to the Group's executive directors.
Basic details of the first set of Performance Awards granted to the executive directors under the LTIP are set out below.

performance conditions - overview
In the case of these initial Performance Awards granted to the executive directors, the Compensation Committee decided to apply 
both a Total Shareholder Return (TSR'') condition and a pre-tax Earnings Per Share (EPS'') target. EPS and TSR were chosen 
as appropriate performance indicators as they are considered to provide a balanced incentive, as participants are encouraged to 
drive earnings growth as well as returns to shareholders. An independent party will calculate the TSR measures for the purposes of 
determining the extent to which that element of the performance condition is satisfied.
EpS performance condition
For the Performance Awards granted to executive directors on 19 June 2006, the extent to which 60% of the award vests is  
based on the Group's EPS achieved in the final financial year of a three year performance period, being the financial year ending  
on 31 December 2008. 
In particular, the extent to which the EPS element vests will be determined in accordance with the following table:
EPS	 for	 financial	 year	 ending	 31	 December	 2008	 	 	 	 	 Percentage	 of	 EPS	 element	 that	 vests
Less than 13.5p      0%
13.5p      30%
18p      100%
Between 13.5p and 18p      30%-100% on a straight line basis

TSR performance condition
The extent to which the remaining 40% of the Performance Awards granted to executive directors on 19 June 2006 vests is determined 
by reference to a TSR condition measured over the same three year performance period. To assess whether this condition is met, the TSR 
of the Group over the performance period will be compared with the TSR for each company in a comparator group comprising the FTSE 
techMARK Mediscience Index constituents. Subject as specified below, the TSR element will then vest as follows:
Ranking	 of	 the	 Group	 against	 the	 comparator	 group	 	 	 	 	 Percentage	 of	 TSR	 element	 that	 vests
Below median      0%
Median      30%
Upper quartile      100%
Between median and upper quartile     30%-100% on a straight line basis
In addition to the above, no part of the TSR element of the initial Performance Awards will vest unless the Group's absolute TSR has 
been positive over the performance period.
Summary of 2006 LTIp Awards
On 19 June, a total of 267,125 awards of shares were made under the LTIP to a total of 61 employees. Of these, 137,500 awards granted 
to the executive directors carry TSR & EPS conditions; 63,500 awards granted to a further 12 senior members of management carry 
EPS conditions, and the balance at date of grant of awards of 66,125 represent Retention Awards with no performance conditions. 
At the same time as the LTIP was introduced, shareholding guidelines were set for executive directors in terms of which they are 
encouraged to build up a holding of ordinary shares equal in value to at least 100% of salary. Until these levels are achieved it is 
expected that individual executive directors will retain 50% of net gains from any of the Group's share plans.

Share Options (audited)
Following the approval of the LTIP by shareholders at the 2006 AGM, no further share options, other than under the ShareSave 
schemes, from which the executive directors are excluded, will be granted. 
However, the executive directors continue to hold options under the Medium Term Share Option Scheme, as follows:

All options set out in the previous table are subject to the following performance condition: earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation (EBITDA) must be positive for at least the two financial years immediately prior to exercise and EBITDA per share, 
once positive, should achieve growth which exceeds the percentage growth in the Retail Price Index by 4% or more. In addition, the 
growth in the Group's share price between date of grant and at least one day during the option period must put it in the top third of 
companies which comprise the All Share Health Index. 
The market price of the shares at 29 December 2006 was 272.25p (30 December 2005: 304p) and the range throughout the period was 
237.25p to 393.50p.
pERFORMANCE GRAph
The following graph shows the Group's performance measured by the total shareholder return, compared with the performance of the 
FTSE techMARK Mediscience Index from 31 December 2001 to 31 December 2006. This index has been selected for this comparison 
because it provides the best measure of performance of companies operating in the same sector as the Group. 
Service contracts
It is the Committee's policy to offer service contracts with a maximum of one year's notice and each of the executive directors' 
contracts has a one-year notice period. In the event of termination of contract, the executive directors would be entitled to loss of 
salary, proportional bonus, benefits and pensionable service for the notice periods, subject to mitigation where appropriate. 
The most recently executed executive directors' contracts are as follows:
Name	 of	 director	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 Date	 of	 contract

NON-ExECUTIvE DIRECTORS
The Group policy is to establish and maintain a body of non-executive directors with a breadth of international skills and experience 
that is relevant to the Group's business. In this context it is the Board's policy for the non-executive directors to be paid a level of fee 
that reflects market conditions and is sufficient to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience. 
The Chairman, Nigel Keen, has a letter of appointment for a three-year term to September 2007. The appointment may be terminated 
by either party giving not less than six months' notice. The non-executive directors have a letter of appointment for an initial (and 
renewable) term of three years which may be terminated by either party without notice. The terms and conditions of appointment  
of the non-executive directors are available for inspection upon request to the Company Secretary.
