 28  I   Axis-Shield Annual Report 2007
INTRODUCTION
This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 (the Schedule ) 
and also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board 
has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors' remuneration. In accordance with Section 241A of the 
Companies Act 1985 (the Act ) a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Section 235 of the Act requires the auditors to report to the Company's members on the auditable part  of the Directors' 
Remuneration Report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance 
with Part 3 of the Schedule. The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information. 
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Compensation Committee
The Company has established a Compensation Committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations 
of the Combined Code 2006, with the exception that the Group Chairman also serves as Chairman of the Compensation 
Committee. The Board considers this to be appropriate because it is essential that the Chairman be involved in the work of 
the Committee and, in particular, the setting of the executive directors' remuneration. The Board also considers the Chairman 
of the Board to be best placed to fulfil this function. 
During 2007 the members of the Committee were Nigel Keen (Chairman), Erik Hornnaess, Linda McGoldrick, Bay Green and 
Staffan Ek. Linda McGoldrick resigned as a director on 10 May 2007.
None of the Committee had any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interest from cross-
directorships or day-to-day involvement in the running of the business. The Committee makes recommendations to  
the Board. No director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration. 
In determining the directors' remuneration for 2007, the Committee consulted Mr Svein Lien (Chief Executive Officer)  
about its proposals. The Committee also took advice from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP on the structure of directors' 
remuneration packages. Shepherd+ Wedderburn LLP , the Company's legal advisers, provided advice and services in relation  
to the Company's various share incentive plans. 
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Company's website, www.axis-shield.com.
REMUNERATION POLICY - EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the necessary calibre and  
to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The performance measurement of the executive directors and key 
members of senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration package is undertaken by the Committee. 
Executive directors' remuneration packages comprise:
Basic annual salary  	
Benefits-in-kind  	
Annual bonus payments (maximum 60% - 75% of salary)  	
Share incentive plans  	
Pension arrangements.  	
The Company's policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be  
performance related in alignment with shareholders' interests.
Executive directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company provided that the Chairman's prior permission 
is sought. Executive directors are entitled to retain fees payable from such appointments. 
Directors' Remuneration Report Axis-Shield Annual Report 2007  I  29
DETAILED ELEMENTS OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
Basic salary
An executive director's basic salary is reviewed by the Committee at the beginning of each year and when an individual 
changes position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the position in the Group, 
personal and Company performance and relies on objective research which gives up-to-date information on a comparable 
group of companies. Basic salaries were last reviewed in February 2008, with increases taking effect from January 2008.  
The next review will take place in 2009.
Benefits in kind
Benefits in kind comprise company car and running costs, private health and disability insurance and critical illness/death  
in service cover. 
Annual bonus payments
At the start of each financial year the Committee agrees specific objectives for each executive director. Following the end  
of each financial year, the Committee determines the performance-related annual cash bonus for each executive director  
for the year just ended. This is based on the director's performance in achieving the objectives agreed. These comprise both 
financial and non-financial objectives. 
Objectives for 2007 put emphasis on superior performance against budgeted profit before tax on a Group and Divisional 
basis and for the Chief Executive Officer and the Finance Director, the Company's relative share price performance.  
Personal objectives were focused on the Afinion  and AxSYM
 
 xtra product areas, cash flow and, where appropriate, 
research and development objectives. Targets for the 2008 bonus will be broadly similar.
The bonus payment continues to be subject to a maximum of 60% of basic salary for executive directors other than the  
Chief Executive Officer. For the Chief Executive Officer the maximum bonus payment will be subject to a maximum of 75%. 
Pension arrangements
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme for executive directors whereby the Group contributes up to 25% of an 
executive director's gross salary, subject to the executive director contributing up to 12.5% of gross salary on a matching 
basis. If preferred, the contributions can be paid to a director's personal pension scheme.
Under a flexible benefits arrangement, individual directors can forego other benefits in return for equivalent increases  
in pension fund provision to which the Company contributes. No pension contribution is payable on the annual bonus.  
During 2007, five of the directors had personal pensions to which the Company contributed. Three of the executive directors, 
who were tax-resident in Norway, diverted a proportion of the Company's pension contribution towards the defined benefit 
scheme run by the Norwegian subsidiaries, as outlined in Note 26 to the Accounts. 
Contractual obligations
Svein Lien and Olav Steinnes resigned as directors of the Company with effect from 31 December 2007. In accordance 
with the terms of their Service Contracts, they have entered into a period of garden leave for a maximum of 12 months 
commencing 1 January 2008. The Company has made provision for the maximum cost of these contractual obligations  
in the year ended 31 December 2007.  30  I   Axis-Shield Annual Report 2007

LONg TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP ), approved by shareholders at the 2006 Annual General Meeting, is intended to 
incentivise the Company's senior management team to create shareholder value whilst retaining due focus on the underlying 
financial performance of the Group and to more closely align their interests with those of the Company's shareholders.
Under the LTIP , conditional awards of shares can be granted to selected employees, including the executive directors,  
at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. The maximum value of shares awarded to a participant under the LTIP  
in relation to any financial year is limited to 75% of the individual's basic salary (150% in exceptional circumstances). 
Two different forms of award can be granted under the LTIP: Performance Awards'', the vesting of which is generally 
conditional on both continued employment over the period of three years from grant and on the extent to which stringent 
performance conditions are satisfied over a pre-determined performance period; and Retention Awards'', the vesting of 
which is solely dependent on continued employment. However, no Retention Awards can be granted to the Company's 
executive directors.
Performance conditions - overview
In the case of Performance Awards granted to the executive directors, the Compensation Committee has applied both a 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR'') condition and a pre-tax Earnings Per Share (EPS'') target. EPS and TSR were chosen as 
appropriate performance indicators as they are considered to provide a balanced incentive, as participants are encouraged 
to drive earnings growth as well as returns to shareholders. An independent party will calculate the TSR measures for the 
purposes of determining the extent to which that element of the performance condition is satisfied.
EPS performance condition
For the Performance Awards granted to executive directors on 19 June 2006 and 9 October 2007,  the extent to which 60%  
of the award vests is based on the Company's EPS achieved in the final financial year of a three year performance period, 
being the financial years ending on 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2009 respectively. 
Directors' Remuneration Report continued Axis-Shield Annual Report 2007  I  31
In particular, the extent to which the EPS element vests will be determined in accordance with the following table:
 
EPS for the final financial year of the performance period      Percentage of EPS element that vests
Less than 13.5p        0%
13.5p        30%
18p        100%
Between 13.5p and 18p 30% - 100% on a straight line basis
It should be noted that the required levels of EPS performance for the Performance Awards granted on 9 October 2007 
are the same as those that were set for the Performance Awards granted on 19 June 2006. However, this reflected the 
Compensation Committee's view (at time of the grant of 9 October 2007) that achieving these EPS figures in the year ending  
31 December 2009 represented an appropriately stretching and demanding target.
TSR performance condition
The extent to which the remaining 40% of the Performance Awards granted to executive directors on 19 June 2006 and  
9 October 2007 vests is determined by reference to a TSR condition measured over a three year performance period.  
To assess whether this condition is met, the TSR of the Company over the performance period will be compared with  
the TSR for each company in a comparator group comprised of the FTSE techMARK Mediscience Index constituents. 
Subject as specified below, the TSR element will then vest as follows:
Ranking of the Company against the comparator group      Percentage of TSR element that vests
Below median        0%
Median        30%
Upper quartile        100%
Between median and upper quartile 30% - 100% on a straight line basis
In addition to the above, no part of the TSR element of the Performance Awards will vest unless the Company's absolute TSR 
has been positive over the performance period.
Details of LTIP awards of the directors who served during the financial year ended 31 December 2007 are set out in the table below.

Shareholding Guidelines
At the same time as the LTIP was introduced, shareholding guidelines were set for executive directors in terms of which they are 
encouraged to build up a holding of ordinary shares equal in value to at least 100 per cent of salary. Until these levels are achieved 
it is expected that individual executive directors will retain 50 per cent of net gains from any of the Company's share plans. 
SHARE OPTIONS

ExECUTIVE DIRECTORS' SERVICE CONTRACTS
It is the Committee's policy to offer service contracts with a maximum of one year's notice and each of the executive 
directors' contracts has a one-year notice period. In the event of termination of contract, the executive directors would be 
entitled to loss of salary, proportional bonus, benefits and pensionable service for the notice periods, subject to mitigation 
where appropriate. 
Details of the directors' contracts are summarised in the table below:

REMUNERATION - NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Group policy is to establish and maintain a body of non-executive directors with a breadth of international skills and 
experience that is relevant to the Group's business. In this context it is the Board's policy for the non-executive directors to 
be paid a level of fee that reflects market conditions, time commitments and responsibilities and which is sufficient to attract 
individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience. The remuneration of the non-executive directors (other than the 
Chairman) is determined by the Chairman and the executive members of the Board. The remuneration of the Chairman is 
determined by the Compensation Committee.
The Chairman, Nigel Keen, had a letter of appointment for a three year term which expired in September 2007.  
This appointment has been renewed for a further period of three years. The appointment may be terminated by either  
party giving not less than six months' notice. The non-executive directors have a letter of appointment for an initial  
(and renewable) term of three years which may be terminated by either party without notice. The terms and conditions  
of appointment of the non-executive directors are available for inspection upon request to the Company Secretary.
Under an arrangement between the Company and Imperialise Ltd, Nigel Keen is retained to act as Chairman of the Company. 
Mr Keen's fees are  65,000 per annum, which includes a fee of  5,000 for Chairmanship of the Compensation Committee.  
In addition, Imperialise Ltd is paid a sum equivalent to the National Insurance on those fees at the rate of 12.8% of gross fees. 
The basic fee paid to non-executive directors is  25,000 per annum. In addition, Bay Green was paid an additional  5,000 per 
annum as Chairman of the Audit Committee and Erik Hornnaess was paid an additional  5,000 as Senior Independent Director.
