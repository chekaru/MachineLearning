 INTRODUCTION
This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 ( the Schedule') and also meets 
the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of 
Good Governance relating to directors' remuneration. In accordance with section 241A of the Companies Act 1985 ( the Act') a resolution  
to approve the report will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Section 235 of the Act requires the auditors to report to the Company's members on the  auditable part' of the Directors' Remuneration Report 
and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with Part 3 of the Schedule. The report 
has therefore been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information. 
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Compensation Committee
The Company has established a Compensation Committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined 
Code 2006, with the exception that the Group Chairman also serves as Chairman of the Compensation Committee. The Board considers  
this to be appropriate because it is essential that the Chairman be involved in the work of the Committee and, in particular, the setting of the 
executive directors' remuneration. The Board also considers the Chairman of the Board to be best placed to fulfil this function. 
During 2008 the members of the Committee were Nigel Keen (Chairman), Erik Hornnaess, Bay Green and Staffan Ek.
None of the Committee had any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interest from cross-directorships or  
day-to-day involvement in the running of the business. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board. No director plays a part  
in any discussion about his or her own remuneration. 
In determining the directors' remuneration for 2008, the Committee consulted Ian Gilham (Chief Executive Officer). The Committee also took 
advice from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP on the structure of directors' remuneration package. Shepherd & Wedderburn LLP provided 
advice and services in relation to the Company's various share incentive plans. 
The terms of reference of the Committee are on the Company's website, www.axis-shield.com.
REMUNERATION POLICY - EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the necessary calibre and to reward them for 
enhancing value to shareholders. The performance of the executive directors is reviewed by the Committee and their annual remuneration 
package is determined. 
Executive directors' remuneration packages comprise:
  basic annual salary;
  benefits-in-kind;
  annual bonus payments;
  pension arrangements; and
  share incentive plans.
The Company's policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be performance-related in alignment 
with shareholders' interests. 
Executive directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company provided that the Chairman's prior permission is granted. 
Executive directors are entitled to retain fees payable from such appointments. 
REMUNERATION
Basic salary
The executive directors' basic salaries are reviewed by the Committee at the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position 
or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the individual's position in the Group, and his personal and Group 
performance and relies on objective research that gives up-to-date information on a comparable group of companies. Basic salaries were last 
reviewed in February 2009, with increases taking effect from January 2009. The next review will take place in 2010.
Benefits in kind
Benefits in kind comprise company car and running costs, private health and disability insurance and critical illness and death-in-service cover. 
Directors' Remuneration Report 
34 | Axis-Shield Annual Report 2008
Directors' Remuneration Report Annual bonus payments
At the start of each financial year the Committee agrees specific objectives for each executive director. Following the end of each financial year, 
the Committee determines the performance-related annual cash bonus for each executive director for the year just ended. This is based on the 
director's performance in achieving the objectives agreed. These comprise both financial and non-financial objectives. 
Objectives for 2008 continued to put emphasis on performance against budgeted profit before tax on a Group basis, and for the Chief 
Executive Officer and the Finance Director, the Company's relative share price performance. Personal objectives were focused on the Afinion
 
 
and AxSYM
 
 xtra product areas, cash flow and, where appropriate, research and development objectives. T argets for the 2009 bonus will be 
broadly similar.
Bonus payments for 2008 were subject to a maximum of 75% of basic salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 60% for other executive directors. 
Pension arrangements
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme for executive directors whereby the Group contributes up to 25% of an executive director's 
gross salary, subject to the executive director contributing up to 12.5% of gross salary on a matching basis. If preferred, the contributions can be 
paid to a director's personal pension scheme.
Under a flexible benefits arrangement, individual directors can forego other benefits in return for equivalent increases in Company pension fund 
contributions. No pension contribution is payable on the annual bonus. 
Contractual obligations
Svein Lien and Olav Steinnes resigned as directors of the Group with effect from 31 December 2007, so their remuneration is not shown in the 
table below. In accordance with the terms of their Service Contracts, they entered into a period of Garden Leave for a maximum of 12 months 
commencing 1 January 2008. The Company made provision for the maximum cost of these contractual obligations in the year ended 31 
December 2007.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (AUDITED)
The Long-T erm Incentive Plan ( LTIP'), approved by shareholders at the 2006 Annual General Meeting, is intended to incentivise the Company's 
senior management team to create shareholder value whilst retaining due focus on the underlying financial performance of the Group and to 
align more closely their interests with those of the Company's shareholders.
Under the LTIP , conditional awards of shares can be granted to selected employees, including the executive directors, at the discretion of the 
Compensation Committee. The maximum value of shares awarded to a participant under the LTIP in relation to any financial year is limited to 
75% of the individual's basic salary (150% in exceptional circumstances). 
T wo different forms of award can be granted under the LTIP:  Performance Awards', the vesting of which is generally conditional on both 
continued employment over the period of three years from grant and on the extent to which stringent performance conditions are satisfied over 
a pre-determined performance period; and  Retention Award', the vesting of which is solely dependent on continued employment. However,  
no Retention Awards can be granted to the Company's executive directors.
Axis-Shield Annual Report 2008 | 35 Performance conditions - overview
In the case of Performance Awards granted to the executive directors, the Compensation Committee has applied both a T otal Shareholder 
Return ( TSR') condition and a pre-tax Earnings Per Share ( EPS') target. EPS and TSR were chosen as appropriate performance indicators as 
they are considered to provide a balanced incentive, as participants are encouraged to drive earnings growth as well as returns to shareholders. 
An independent party calculates the TSR measures for the purposes of determining the extent to which that element of the performance 
condition is satisfied.
EPS performance condition
For the Performance Awards granted to executive directors on 19 June 2006, 9 October 2007 and 6 October 2008, the extent to which 60% of 
the award vests is based on the Company's EPS achieved in the final financial year of a three-year performance period, being the financial years 
ending on 31 December 2008, 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2010 respectively. 
In particular, the extent to which the EPS element vests will be determined in accordance with the following table:
   EPS for years ending  EPS for years ending 
Percentage of EPS element that vests   31 December 2008 and 2009  31 December 2010
0%   Less than 13.5p Less than 18.5p
30%   13.5p 18.5p
30% - 100% on a straight line basis   Between 13.5p and 18p Between 18.5p and 26.5p
100%    18p and above 26.5p and above
TSR performance condition
The extent to which the remaining 40% of the Performance Awards granted to executive directors on 19 June 2006, 9 October 2007 and  
6 October 2008 vests is determined by reference to a TSR condition measured over a three-year performance period. T o assess whether this 
condition is met, the TSR of the Company over the performance period will be compared with the TSR for each company in a comparator  
group comprised of the FTSE techMARK Mediscience Index constituents. 
No part of the TSR element of the initial Performance Awards will vest unless the Company's absolute TSR has been positive over the 
performance period. If this condition is met, then the TSR element will then vest as follows:

Between median and upper quartile   30-100% on a straight line basis

Directors' Remuneration Report Shareholding Guidelines
At the same time the LTIP was introduced, shareholding guidelines were set for executive directors in terms of which they are encouraged 
to build up a holding of Ordinary Shares equal in value to at least 100% of salary. Until these levels are achieved it is expected that individual 
executive directors will retain 50% of any awards vesting under the Company's share plans.

The following graph shows the Company's performance measured by the total shareholder return, compared with the performance of the FTSE 
T echmark Mediscience Index from 31 December 2002 to 31 December 2008. This index has been selected for this comparison because it 
provides the best measure of performance of companies operating in the same sector as the Group.
This graph shows the value, by 31 December 2008, of  100 invested in Axis-Shield plc on 31 December 2003 compared with the value of  100 
invested in the FTSE techMARK Mediscience Index on 31 December 2003. The other points are the values at intervening financial year-ends.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' SERVICE CONTRACTS
It is the Committee's policy to offer service contracts with a maximum of one year's notice and each of the executive directors' contracts 
has a one-year notice period. In the event of termination of contract, the executive directors would be entitled to loss of salary, proportional 
bonus, benefits and pensionable service for the notice periods, subject to mitigation where appropriate. Details of the directors' contracts are 
summarised in the table below:
      Date of  
Name of Director      contract

REMUNERATION - NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Group policy is to establish and maintain a body of non-executive directors with a breadth of international skills and experience that is 
relevant to the Group's business. In this context it is the Board's policy for the non-executive directors to be paid a level of fee that reflects 
market conditions, time commitments and responsibilities and which is sufficient to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge and 
experience. 
The Chairman, Nigel Keen, has a letter of appointment for a three-year term to September 2010. The appointment may be terminated by either 
party giving not less than six months' notice. The non-executive directors have a letter of appointment for an initial (and renewable) term of three 
years' which may be terminated by either party without notice. The terms and conditions of appointment of the non-executive directors are 
available for inspection upon request to the Company Secretary.
Under an arrangement between the Company and Imperialise Ltd, Nigel Keen is retained to act as Chairman of the Company. Mr Keen's 
fees were raised from  65,000 to  77,500 per annum with effect from 1 July 2008, both including a fee of  5,000 for Chairmanship of the 
Compensation Committee. In addition, Imperialise Ltd is paid a sum equivalent to the National Insurance on those fees at the rate of 12.8%  
of gross fees. 
The basic fee paid to non-executive directors was raised from  25,000 to  30,000 per annum with effect from 1 July 2008. Bay Green was paid  
an additional  5,000 per annum as Chairman of the Audit Committee and Erik Hornnaess an additional  5,000 as Senior Independent Director .
