Directors' remuneration report
For the year ended 31 December 2002
Unaudited information This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002. The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors'
remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting of the Company to which the financial statements will be presented.
Remuneration committee's objectives The terms of reference of the committee are:
  to agree a set of policies within which each executive director's and key senior manager's remuneration package is
agreed; and
  to assist the Board in wider aspects of remuneration policy, such as the granting of share options.
Remuneration policy From the establishment of Axon, the Group's policy has been to attract, retain and motivate the
best people for each area of the business and to align their objectives to Group performance in order to deliver and grow
value to shareholders.
The remuneration committee objectively compares the remuneration packages of an executive with that of a similar
executive in the same industry sector and to those in other appropriate companies based on size, complexity of industry
and geographical mix. The remuneration committee, to date, has not commissioned reports specific to Axon from
independent consultants but reviews independent market research including trends in competitors and other appropriate
companies' remuneration policies. No director plays a part in the discussion of his or her remuneration. 
Executive directors The remuneration packages of executives will continue to comprise an annual base salary, cash bonus
and long-term incentive schemes. No other annual employment-related benefits are provided since the remuneration
committee believes that the emphasis should be on reward for company performance. Overall performance targets relating
to the cash bonus plan and to the executive share option schemes are, in the opinion of the remuneration committee,
challenging. Bonuses based on Group performance targets form a substantial proportion (up to 50%) of total remuneration
calculated on overall performance targets. The rewards earned by the executive directors in 2002 have reflected the results
of the Company.
Base salary The base salary of executive directors will be determined by the remuneration committee at the start of
each year. 
Mark Hunter and Don Kirkwood (until his resignation on 30 April 2002) received lower base salaries than similar
executives in comparable companies. It having been determined that, whilst the total remuneration targets should be
comparable, the bonus element based on company performance should be higher for them than for similar executive
roles in those comparator companies.
Cash bonus The remuneration committee sets the objectives that must be met if a cash bonus is to be paid. 
Cash bonuses for executive directors are based entirely on the financial performance of the Group and are not capped.
The financial performance measure for executive directors in 2002 was year-on-year growth in PBT and earnings per
share. A limited total of  30,000 cash bonus was paid in 2002 as no year-on-year growth was achieved. PBT growth
year-on-year has been selected by the remuneration committee as the appropriate performance measure for 2003 for
executive directors. The Group does not publish a profit forecast for 2003 and bonus targets cannot be disclosed 
prior to 31 December 2003. Consistent with previous financial years, the remuneration committee has set significant 
year-on-year growth targets which will have to be achieved for cash bonuses to be payable. Any bonuses paid by 
the Group are non-pensionable. 
Long-term incentives The Company operates five long-term incentive share schemes: Axon Solutions Limited
Approved Executive Share Option Scheme, Axon Solutions Limited Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme, 
Axon Group plc Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme, Axon Group plc Unapproved Discretionary Share 
Option Scheme and Axon Group plc 2001 Unapproved Discretionary Share Option Scheme.
The details of the directors' holdings are listed on page 24 of this report. Full details of the schemes are in note 28 to 
the financial statements.
Pensions The Group does not contribute to any pension schemes on behalf of executive directors.
External directorships The remuneration committee has discretion to approve whether an executive director may
accept external appointments. No executive director currently holds any such appointment.
Non-executive directors The Board determines the remuneration of the non-executive directors. Their remuneration is
not pensionable and they are not eligible for performance-related remuneration by way of a cash bonus or participation
in any share option scheme. 23 Axon Directors' remuneration report

Axon has been a member of the techMARK All-Share Index since its inception in 1999. techMARK companies represent
a broad range of industries from the computer hardware, semiconductor, telecommunications equipment, computer
services, internet and software sectors, but all companies share a key attribute - technological innovation. In the opinion
of the directors of Axon Group plc, the techMARK All-Share index is the most suitable Index against which Axon's share
price should be tracked. The base of 100 for both indices is as at 10 March 1999, the date of floatation. Axon's placing
price was 175p.
