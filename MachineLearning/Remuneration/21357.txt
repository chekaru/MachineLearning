 Unaudited information This report has been prepared in accordance with the directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. 
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board
has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors' remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to
approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company to which the financial statements will be presented.
Remuneration committee's objectives The terms of reference of the committee are:
  to agree a set of policies within which each executive director's and key senior manager's remuneration package is agreed; and
  to assist the Board in wider aspects of remuneration policy, such as the granting of share options.
Remuneration policy From the establishment of Axon, the Group's policy has been to attract, retain and motivate the best people 
for each area of the business and to align their objectives to Group performance in order to deliver and grow value to shareholders.
The remuneration committee objectively compares the remuneration packages of an executive with that of a similar executive in 
the same industry sector and to those in other appropriate companies based on size, complexity of industry and geographical mix. 
The remuneration committee, to date, has not commissioned reports specific to Axon from independent consultants but reviews
independent market research including trends in competitors and other appropriate companies' remuneration policies. No director
plays a part in the discussion of his or her remuneration.
Executive directors The remuneration packages of executives will continue to comprise an annual base salary, cash bonus and
participation in long-term incentive schemes. No other annual employment-related benefits are provided since the remuneration
committee believes that the emphasis should be on reward for Company performance. Overall performance targets relating to 
the cash bonus plan and to the executive share option schemes are, in the opinion of the remuneration committee, challenging.
Bonuses based on Group performance targets form a substantial proportion (up to 60%) of total remuneration calculated on 
overall performance targets. The rewards earned by the executive directors in 2005 have reflected the results of the Company.
Base salary The base salary of executive directors will be determined by the remuneration committee at the start of each year.
Mark Hunter and Stephen Cardell received lower base salaries than similar executives in comparable companies. It has been
determined that, whilst the total remuneration targets should be comparable, the bonus element based on Company performance
should be higher for them than for similar executive roles in those comparator companies.
Cash bonus The remuneration committee sets the objectives that must be met if a cash bonus is to be paid. Cash bonuses for
executive directors are based entirely on the financial performance of the Group and the remuneration committee agrees a cap each
year up to a maximum of 300% of base salary. The financial performance measure for executive directors in 2005 was year-on-year
growth in revenue and adjusted PBT. A total of  470,000 cash bonuses were awarded in respect of 2005 as significant year-on-year
growth of revenue and adjusted PBT was achieved. Revenue and adjusted PBT growth year-on-year has been selected by the
remuneration committee as the appropriate performance measure for 2006 for executive directors. The Group does not publish a profit
forecast for 2006 and bonus targets cannot be disclosed prior to 31 December 2006. Consistent with previous financial years, the
remuneration committee has set significant year-on-year growth targets which will have to be achieved for cash bonuses to be payable.
Any bonuses paid by the Group are non-pensionable.
Long-term incentives The Company operates five long-term incentive share schemes: Axon Solutions Limited Approved Executive
Share Option Scheme, Axon Solutions Limited Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme, Axon Group plc Approved Discretionary
Share Option Scheme, Axon Group plc Unapproved Discretionary Share Option Scheme and Axon Group plc 2001 Unapproved
Discretionary Share Option Scheme.
During the year three founding shareholders, one of whom is Mark Hunter, set up a long-term incentive scheme over their own shares
for key management within the business. The aim of the scheme is to reward individuals for a significant increase in shareholder value,
being measured by the increase in share price.
The details of the directors' holdings are listed on page 24 of this report. Full details of the schemes are in note 28 to the financial
statements.
Pensions The Group does not contribute to any pension schemes on behalf of executive directors.
External directorships The remuneration committee has discretion to approve whether an executive director may accept external
appointments. Stephen Cardell holds one other non-executive directorship, for which he receives no remuneration, which was
approved by the remuneration committee on 23 February 2005. No other executive director currently holds any non-executive
directorships.
Non-executive directors The Board determines the remuneration of the non-executive directors. Their remuneration is not pensionable
and they are not eligible for performance-related remuneration by way of a cash bonus or participation in any share option scheme.

Remuneration report
Remuneration report For the year ended 31 December 2005 Axon has been a member of the techMARK All-Share Index since its inception in 1999. techMARK companies represent a broad range
of industries from the computer hardware, semiconductor, telecommunications equipment, computer services, internet and software
sectors, but all companies share a key attribute - technological innovation. In the opinion of the directors of Axon Group plc, the
techMARK All-Share Index is the most suitable index against which Axon's share price should be tracked. The graph shows the value
over five years of  100 invested in Axon shares on 1 January 2001 assuming that all dividend income is reinvested compared to the
FTSE techMARK All Share Index.
