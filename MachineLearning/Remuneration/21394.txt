Annual report and accounts 2007
Remuneration report
For the year ended 31 December 2007
Unaudited information This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. The report
also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the
Principles of Good Governance relating to directors' remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be
proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company to which the financial statements will be presented.
Remuneration committee's objectives The terms of reference of the Remuneration committee are:
  to agree a set of policies within which each executive director's and senior manager's remuneration package is agreed; and
  to assist the Board in wider aspects of remuneration policy, such as the granting of share-based incentives.
The Remuneration committee is also responsible for setting the Company Chairman's pay and conditions (with the Chairman absent from
such discussions).
Remuneration policy From the establishment of Axon, the Group's policy has been to attract, retain and motivate the best people for each
area of the business and to align their objectives to Group performance in order to deliver and grow value to shareholders.
The Remuneration committee objectively compares the remuneration packages of an executive with that of a similar executive in the same
industry sector and to those in other appropriate companies based on size, complexity of industry and geographical mix. Historically, the
Remuneration committee has not commissioned reports specific to Axon from independent consultants but has instead reviewed
independent market research including trends in competitors and other appropriate companies' remuneration policies. However, since the
year end, the Remuneration committee has appointed New Bridge Street Consultants LLP to advise on the remuneration policy and to
undertake a review and report to the Committee on senior executive remuneration during 2008, with particular reference to the structure of
future equity incentives. The Group will engage with major shareholders and the principal shareholder representative bodies as appropriate.
No executive director plays a part in the discussion of his or her own remuneration.
In setting remuneration packages for executive directors, the Remuneration committee considers how these compare with remuneration for
employees more generally. There are no pension arrangements or equity schemes in place that are designed only for executive directors.
The Remuneration committee has discretion to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance (ESG ) issues
when setting the remuneration of executive directors. The committee does not believe that ESG risks are inadvertently raised by the
incentive structures currently in place.
Executive directors The Remuneration packages of executives will continue to comprise an annual base salary, cash bonus and
participation in long-term incentive schemes. No other annual employment-related benefits are provided since the Remuneration committee
believes that the emphasis should be on reward for Company performance. Overall performance targets relating to the cash bonus plan
and to the executive share option schemes are, in the opinion of the Remuneration committee, challenging. Bonuses based on Group
performance targets form a substantial proportion (up to 60%) of total remuneration calculated on overall performance targets. The rewards
earned by the executive directors in 2007 have reflected the results of the Group.
Base salary The base salary of executive directors will be determined by the Remuneration committee at the start of each year having
regard to personal and Group performance, competitive market practice and pay levels more broadly within the Group.
Historically, Mark Hunter and Stephen Cardell have received significantly lower base salaries than similar executives in comparable
companies. After a review of comparable companies in December 2007, the committee has decided the remuneration of the Chief Executive
Officer should move towards mid-market levels.
For 2008, base salaries for Stephen Cardell and Iain McIntosh were increased to  350,000 and  195,000 respectively. The Remuneration
committee believes these salary levels are now in line with survey data for larger UK FTSE Small Cap companies allowing for the absence of
benefits and pension provision within these executives' packages.
The Company reimburses the amount by which Stephen Cardell is impacted by incremental US taxes payable on his remuneration over and
above those payable in the UK.
Cash bonus The Remuneration committee sets the objectives that must be met if a cash bonus is to be paid. Cash bonuses for executive
directors are based entirely on the financial performance of the Group and the Remuneration committee agrees a cap. For 2008 the caps are
set up to a maximum of 100% and 80% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer respectively, which the
Remuneration committee believes to be in line with comparable sized UK listed companies.
The financial performance measure for executive directors in 2007 was year-on-year growth in revenue and adjusted profit before tax
(PBT ). These measures have been chosen as the best measures of short-term operational financial performance. Maximum bonuses are
payable in respect of 2007 as significant year-on-year revenue and adjusted PBT growth in excess of targets was achieved. Revenue and
adjusted PBT growth year-on-year have been selected by the Remuneration committee as the appropriate performance measures for 2008
for executive directors. The Group does not publish a profit forecast for 2008 and bonus targets cannot be disclosed prior to 31 December
2008 due to commercial sensitivity. Consistent with previous financial years, the Remuneration committee has set significant year-on-year
growth targets which will have to be achieved for cash bonuses to be payable. Any bonuses paid by the Group are non-pensionable.
Long-term incentives The Company operates the Axon Group plc Performance Share Plan as the principal long-term incentive
arrangement for executive directors, under which conditional awards are granted.
Awards granted in 2007 will vest subject to the achievement of real growth in earnings per share of 16% over a three year performance
period. There is no provision for retesting of this performance condition. At the time of award, the Remuneration committee believed that the
target was sufficiently challenging in the prevailing market conditions and when compared to other companies in the Company's sector and
that a single target was appropriate to encourage executives to exceed this level of performance. Remuneration report (continued)
26 Axon Group plc
Annual report and accounts 2007
The operation of the Performance Share Plan will be reviewed by the Committee during the year with the assistance of its independent
advisers.
The details of the directors' holdings are listed on pages 28 and 29 of this report. Full details of the other long-term incentive schemes
operated by the Company (in a number of which executive directors have participated in past years), including the performance conditions,
are set out in note 30 to the financial statements
Pensions The Group does not contribute to any pension schemes on behalf of executive directors except for payments to the UK Group
Personal Pension Plan made under a defined contribution salary sacrifice scheme whereby employees may elect to forgo part of their basic
pay in return for pension payments made by the Group. This provides for the employee to receive the benefit of any reduction to the
Company's National Insurance liability as a result of electing to make a pension payment. Iain McIntosh was a member of the plan in 2006
and 2007 on the same basis as that available to other UK employees.
External directorships The Remuneration committee has discretion to approve whether an executive director may accept external
appointments. Stephen Cardell holds one non-executive directorship, for which he receives no remuneration, which was approved by the
Remuneration committee on 23 February 2005. No other executive director currently holds any non-executive directorships.
Chairman and non-executive directors The Board determines the remuneration of non-executive directors. Their remuneration is not
pensionable and they are not eligible for performance-related remuneration by way of a cash bonus or participation in any share option
scheme. Remuneration for the non-executive directors excluding the Chairman has been set at  35,000 effective 1 January 2008, with an
additional  5,000 for acting as Chairman of either the Audit or Remuneration committees. These fee levels have been set to reflect the time
commitment and responsibility of each role and are considered to be in line with levels at comparable UK listed companies.
Reflecting his appointment as non-executive Chairman from 1 January 2008, Roy Merritt's remuneration was increased to  75,000 per annum
by the Remuneration committee.

Axon's total shareholder return compared to FTSE techMARK All-Share index
Axon has been a member of the FTSE techMARK All-Share index since its inception in 1999. FTSE techMARK companies represent a broad
range of industries from the computer hardware, semiconductor, telecommunications equipment, computer services, internet and software
sectors, but all companies share a key attribute - technological innovation. In the opinion of the directors of Axon Group plc, the FTSE
techMARK All-Share index is the most suitable index against which Axon's share price should be tracked. The graph shows the value over five
years of  100 invested in Axon shares on 1 January 2003 assuming that all dividend income is reinvested, compared to the FTSE techMARK
All-Share index. Performance against the FTSE techMARK 100, of which the Company is also a constituent, is also shown.
