 28 Babcock International Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2003
Remuneration Committee
This report sets out the company's policy on the remuneration of its Directors which it followed for the year under review and intends to
follow for the current financial year and subsequent years. It also provides details of the Directors' remuneration packages and contracts.
The report will be the subject of an advisory vote at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the company.
Responsibility for determining and approving the remuneration packages of the executive Directors and certain other senior group
executives has been delegated by the Board to a Remuneration Committee ( the Committee') consisting solely of all the non-executive
directors of the company, each of whom the Board considers to be independent. Those Directors who served on the Committee for all 
or part of the last financial year were as follows (with those currently still on the Committee indicated in bold type), namely:
The Rt Hon Lord Hesketh (Committee Chairman)
D J Shah 
M J Turner
J L Rennocks (since 13 June 2002)
Sir Nigel Essenhigh (since 4 March 2003)
A E Wheatley (until 26 July 2002)
Details of the continuing members of the Committee are set out on page 22.
Mr Campbell attends meetings of the Committee in his capacity as Group Chairman, and Mr Dungate attends as Secretary to the
Committee. The Committee has access to market research on remuneration. Advice on matters affecting remuneration is sought by 
or on behalf of the Committee from Mr Campbell (other than in respect of his own remuneration); in connection with the structuring 
of share awards and share schemes from Pinsents (solicitors with recognised expertise and experience in executive and employee 
share schemes) and, since November 2002, for advice on executive remuneration, share option and Long Term Incentive Plans from
Inbucon-Meis (remuneration consultants). Pinsents also provide legal services to group companies. Inbucon-Meis do not provide 
other services to group companies. Both firms were appointed for these purposes, with the Committee's approval, by the company 
(acting through the Group Company Secretary).
The Committee also acts as the Nomination Committee in connection with the appointment of new Directors.
Remuneration policy
Basic policy
The remuneration policy of the Committee is ordinarily to provide executive Directors and senior executives with basic remuneration
packages that, looked at as a whole, are competitive having regard to the median for companies of a similar size in business sectors 
in which the group operates or into which it intends to develop, with the opportunity to earn upper quartile rewards for upper 
quartile performance, and that are sufficient to recruit, retain and motivate executives in the light of the company's needs and
development objectives. 
Remuneration packages consist, to varying degrees as between individuals, of fixed elements - basic salary, pension entitlements and
typical benefits in kind - and performance related elements - annual bonus schemes (linked to company and/or personal performance)
and share-based or share-related longer term incentive schemes. Currently the share-based schemes are share option schemes, though 
the company intends, with shareholders' approval (which is being sought at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting), to establish a 
Long-Term Incentive Plan which could use share awards. The table on page 30 shows the relative value of the fixed and performance
related elements of the continuing executive Directors' emoluments for the year under review. For that year, the performance related
element consisted of annual bonus-schemes, the value of which was capped, and share option awards. Their share options, having been
granted within the last three years, have yet to mature.
Performance related rewards:
Annual bonus schemes: The Remuneration Committee determines a performance related annual bonus scheme for each executive
Director at the beginning of each financial year. For the year ended 31 March 2003 the bonus payable was dependent on the financial
performance achieved by the group against budget and, in the case of Directors other than the Chairman, on the achievement of 
specific personal objectives. The maximum potential annual bonus for executive Directors was 50% of basic salary; 60% in the case of 
Mr Campbell. In the case of Mr Campbell, his bonus was calculated on the amount of his salary plus the payment made by the company
into a pension scheme on his behalf, he having been paid a lower salary to take account of this benefit. The Committee has the discretion
in exceptional circumstances where it considers his performance merits it, to award up to 20% of his basic salary to Mr Campbell,
notwithstanding that a bonus has not been triggered on the group's financial performance against target. Similar schemes are in 
place for executive Directors for the current financial year. Annual bonuses are not pensionable.
Long-term incentive schemes: Under the Babcock 1999 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme and the Babcock 1999 Unapproved
Executive Share Option Scheme ( the 1999 Schemes'), performance criteria have been applied to the grant of options. The current
executive Directors of the company hold options only under the 1999 Schemes or under option agreements that mirror those schemes 
as to performance criteria.
The performance criterion for the vesting of options granted to date under the 1999 Schemes is based on comparative total
shareholder return ( TSR'), with the company's performance over the three financial years beginning with the financial year in which the
option was granted being assessed in relation to companies within the Engineering and Machinery section of the FTSE All Share Index. 
In so far as the company's TSR performance is in the top quartile, share option awards will vest in full; if the company is ranked at the first
position above median 25% of the option shares will vest, with proportionate vesting for performance between those levels. In so far as
the company's performance falls below the median, no options will vest. This group was chosen as then being the appropriate comparator
as, at the time of the grants, the company was part of the Engineering section of the FTSE All Share Index. 
Further details of the company's share option schemes are set out on pages 24 and 31. Details of share options already granted to
Directors are set out in the table on page 31.
The Committee periodically reviews the company's incentive arrangements and takes advice on market practice for remunerating 
key employees. Following a recent review by Inbucon-Meis, the Board is seeking approval at this year's Annual General Meeting of a new
long-term incentive plan for senior executives to be known as the Babcock 2003 L-TIP ( the L-TIP').
The Committee is firmly of the view that offering senior executives the opportunity to be awarded shares in the company, or cash
awards linked to the value of the company's shares, is an important part of motivating and rewarding key employees so that they may
participate in the future growth in value of the company. The L-TIP is intended to support this objective and to facilitate the retention of key
senior executives over the longer term. Under the L-TIP, selected senior executives (including executive Directors) within the group may be
awarded each year conditional entitlements to shares in the company ( Award Shares') or to a cash sum whose value is linked to a notional
award of Award Shares. It is envisaged that, initially, awards will be made to the executive Directors of the company and a limited number
of other senior executives. The initial market value of the shares over which any such award is made may not exceed 100% of the amount
of the participant's basic annual salary at the date of grant. The number or proportion of such Award Shares which vest will be determined
by reference to the extent to which pre-set targets, relating to the performance of the company over a fixed three-year period beginning
with that in which the award is made, are met or exceeded. 
Performance targets will be set by the Committee when an award is made, having regard to current market conditions. In relation to
awards made under the L-TIP before 31 March 2004, no Award Shares will vest unless the company is at or above the median level in the
table of comparator companies ranked according to total shareholder return over the three years ending 31 March 2006. 
Remuneration report
9366 Babcock R&A 2003 - Mid  18/6/03  12:28 pm  Page 28 The comparator companies will be all of the UK listed companies in the FTSE All Share Index (excluding investment trusts) used for the 
FTSE Actuaries' Share Indices. If the company is ranked at or immediately above the 50th centile, 25% of the Award Shares will vest. 
If the company is ranked in the top quartile, all of the Award Shares will vest. If the company is ranked between these threshold 
levels, the percentage of Award Shares which will vest will be calculated on a straight-line basis between 25% and 100% respectively. 
In addition, Award Shares will not vest unless the company's adjusted earnings per share pre-goodwill and exceptional items in the
year ending 31 March 2006 is at least 9.27% (representing a 3% per annum compound growth rate) greater than the adjusted earnings
per share pre-goodwill and exceptional items for the year ended 31 March 2003. 
Awards under the L-TIP will be capable of being made by either the company, as rights to acquire shares held in treasury, or by 
the trustee of The Babcock Employees' Share Trust ( the Trustee') acting on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee.
Alternatively the company may make the grant in the form of a conditional award of a cash sum whose value will be determined by
reference to the value of a notional award of rights to acquire Award Shares. The operation of the L-TIP will be overseen by the
Remuneration Committee. Further information about the proposed L-TIP is set out on pages 65 and 66. 
If the L-TIP is approved, it is the intention that any further share based incentives granted to executive Directors would be made under
the L-TIP and not under the 1999 Schemes, and awards made under it to an executive Director or other employee would not in any year
have a value in excess of his basic salary at the date of the award (save in so far as a share award may be grossed up to compensate the
award holder for the cost of employer's National Insurance Contributions if the Committee exercises its discretion to require the award
holder to bear that cost). 
Grants of options under the 1999 schemes may continue to be made to senior executives but not, in any year, to recipients of an
award under the L-TIP .
The FTSE All Share Index has been selected as the appropriate comparator group for share-based awards or grants of options made in
the current financial year and reflects the fact that shareholders can choose, instead of investing in shares of the Company, to invest in any
other listed shares.
Performance graphs The graphs below set out the company's cumulative TSR performance against companies in the Engineering 
and Machinery Sector of the FTSE All Share Index, and against companies in the FTSE All Share Index, in each case over the period from 
31 March 1998 to 31 March 2003 reflecting the performance measures mentioned above. They were compiled by Inbucon-Meis. 
Directors' pensions UK based executive Directors of the company are eligible for membership, by invitation, of the company's defined
benefit pension plan. This would entitle them, subject to Inland Revenue limits and period of service, to a retirement pension of up to 
two-thirds of base salary in the 12 months prior to attaining age 60 and life assurance cover of up to four times base salary up to the
earnings cap. For those eligible executive Directors invited to participate in the pension scheme whose earnings exceed the Inland Revenue
earnings cap, the company will, on request, establish a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme (FURBS) and take out additional life
assurance cover to provide additional retirement and life assurance benefits based on salary in excess of the earnings cap. The company
may in lieu of membership of the defined benefit plan or a FURBS make a salary enhancement to reflect this, offer membership of a
defined contribution scheme and/or make payments to a personal pension plan.
A summary of the current executive Directors' pension entitlements is set out on page 30.
Non-executive Directors It is company policy that non-executive Directors do not participate in any of the company's share, pension or
bonus schemes. They are remunerated solely by fees that are reviewed against market practice at least every three years by the executive
Directors, to whom the task has been delegated by the Board.

2) The transfer value of the increase in pension accrued is calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN1 1, and is stated after
deducting members' contributions. 
3) The figures in the above table make no allowance for the cost of death in service benefits under the Scheme.
4) The figures in the above table make no allowance for any benefits in respect of earnings in excess of the Inland Revenue earnings cap.
5) If any member has significant benefits retained in any pension scheme provided by previous employers then the pension entitlements
shown above may be restricted to a lower amount and the figures may need to be reduced accordingly. In calculating the above figures
for Mr W Tame and Mr M S Easton no account has been taken of any retained benefits which they may have.
6) No payments have been made to retired Directors in excess of the retirement benefit to which they were entitled on the date the
benefits first became payable or, if later, 31 March 1997 .

  = Share Options at appointment as a Director

There were no options exercised during the year by any of the above Directors.
There were no changes in the current directors' share options between 31 March 2003 and 1 1 June 2003.
The company's mid-market share price at close of business on 31 March 2003 was 89p. The highest and lowest mid-market share
prices in the year ended 31 March 2003 were 127p and 86p respectively.
The exercise prices of the options granted are not set at a discount to the market value of the company's shares at the date of grant.
Directors may normally exercise their options between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant. There are no performance
criteria attached to the right to exercise options under the Babcock International Group PLC Approved Executive Share Option Scheme and
the Babcock International Group PLC Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme. There are performance criteria (as described on page 28)
attaching to options granted under the Babcock 1999 Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Option Schemes.
Each of Mr Campbell and Mr Rogers were recruited on terms that provided for the issue, shortly after their respective appointments,
of share option contracts with the Trustee of the Babcock Employees' Share Trust enabling them to purchase shares in the company
equivalent in value (at the effective date of the contract) to twice their then rates of basic salary. These options (which are shown in 
the above table as being granted pursuant to a Share Option Agreement) take the form of bilateral contracts between the Trustee and 
Mr Campbell and the Trustee and Mr Rogers each on terms, including as to performance criteria, which mirror those governing options
granted under The Babcock 1999 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme, save only that if the company comes under the control of
another person or persons in consequence of a general takeover offer, these options granted pursuant to the option agreements become
immediately exercisable in respect of all of the shares over which they are held. The performance criterion applicable under the option
contracts is the TSR based criterion mentioned on page 28 as applying to existing share options granted under the 1999 schemes. 
The provisions of the option contracts cannot be altered to the advantage of Mr Campbell or Mr Rogers without the prior approval 
of the company's shareholders in general meeting. The benefits under the option contracts are not pensionable.

Service contracts
The following table sets out a summary of Directors'/former Directors' service contracts or terms of appointment.
Executive Directors

M S Easton 23 January 1 997 31 May 2002 1 2 months
Dr G Sch fer 30 July 1 996 31 December 2002 1 2 months
The company's policy for executive Directors' service contracts is for them to be capable of being terminated by the company on not
more than 12 months' notice, and for the company to reserve the right to terminate those contracts without full notice by payment of
basic salary (and, in the case of Mr Campbell, the value of contractual benefits other than pensions or bonus entitlements) in lieu of notice.
In the event of a change of control of the company, the executive Directors' contracts provide that within 90 days of the occurrence 
of the change of control the executive Director may terminate his employment forthwith. In that case, or if, following a change of control,
the Director's appointment is terminated within 12 months, the Director is entitled to a termination payment equal to 100% of his annual
salary plus an additional 40% (50% in the case of Mr Campbell) in lieu of bonus and all other benefits. Directors' service contracts terminate
automatically on the Director reaching the age of 60. In the event of the termination of a Director's service contract by the company 
(other than following a change of control or by the exercise of the company's option to pay salary in lieu of notice) the company will have
regard to all the circumstances in determining the amount of compensation, if any, payable to him in connection with that termination.

For non-executive Directors the company's policy is to have written terms of appointment, with initial appointments being for a three-year
term, and in all cases appointments being terminable at will. Non-executive Directors are free to resign at any time.
Outside directorships
The company considers that it is often of benefit to it if a Director, executive or non-executive, holds directorships in other companies
outside the group, provided that any such appointment does not conflict with the Director's duties to the company or with the group's
best interests. Before taking up any outside appointment after becoming a Director of the company, a Director must first seek the
approval of the Board. Any fees earned by a Director for his outside appointment are ordinarily retainable by him.
