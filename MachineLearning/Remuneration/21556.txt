67
This Remuneration report has been prepared on behalf of the Board by the Remuneration Committee. The Board considers 
that in all its activities the Remuneration Committee has adopted the principles of good governance as set out in the 
Combined Code and complies with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, the relevant schedules of the 
Companies Act and the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 ( the 
Regulations'). The report is divided into audited and unaudited information. The Regulations require the Company's auditors 
to report that the  Audited information' in this report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Regulations. 
Committee members 
The Committee members (each of whom served throughout the year and is an independent Non-Executive Director) were 
and continue to be: 
Director Meetings attended in the year to 31 March 2010
Justin Crookenden (Chairman) 6 out of 6
Nigel Essenhigh 6 out of 6
John Rennocks 5 out of 6
David Omand 6 out of 6
(Dipesh Shah (who retired as a Director of the Company on 9 July 2009 and retired from the Committee on 31 March 2009) 
served on the Committee throughout the year to 31 March 2009. Matters relating to remuneration in and for the year  
to 31 March 2010 were discussed in that prior period as disclosed in the Directors' Remuneration report for the year ended 
31 March 2009, in which Mr Shah's attendance at its meetings was also reported.) 
Biographical details of the members are set out on pages 50 and 51. 
The Remuneration report will be submitted for shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting on 8 July 2010. 
How the Committee operates 
The Committee now meets formally at least four times a year. The Committee also meets on an ad hoc basis as necessary. 
The Company Secretary attends meetings as secretary to the Committee. The Group Chairman and the Chief Executive 
attend formal meetings by invitation of the Committee, but are not present when their own remuneration is being discussed. 
The Deputy Chairman attends some meetings as an observer. 
During the year, the Committee received advice from Kepler Associates ( Kepler'). Kepler was appointed by the Committee  
at its meeting held on 18 December 2008 after a formal selection process conducted by the Committee. Kepler is formally 
retained, on the Committee's behalf, by the Company (acting through the Company Secretary). Kepler attends most of the 
Committee's meetings and provides, both during those meetings and directly to the Committee Chairman and/or 
Committee members, information, advice and guidance on all aspects of executive remuneration. That assistance has 
included the devising and structuring of overall total remuneration packages and of short- and long-term incentive plans 
(including the setting of targets and the scaling of vesting) that meet the objectives and policy set by the Committee. Kepler 
has also advised on and provided analysis and data for specific aspects of remuneration packages, market developments, 
emerging and best practice and the views of institutional shareholders. Apart from providing such advice, guidance and 
assistance in connection with remuneration proposals for review by the Committee, Kepler provides no other services  
to the Company. 
During the year to 31 March 2010, the Committee undertook the following: 
  Conducted the normal annual review of the basic salaries of Executive Directors and senior managers effective  
1 April 2010; 
  Set or discussed the terms of annual bonus schemes for each of the financial years to 31 March 2010 and 2011; 
  Agreed with the Board new Terms of Reference for the Committee, reflecting best practice; 
  Considered the extent to which remuneration packages for Executive Directors and senior managers might encourage 
undue risk-taking and the extent to which they are sensitive to risk; 
  Assured itself that it has general oversight of the terms for those individuals within its remit, as defined in the Committee's 
Terms of Reference; 
  Considered whether risk or compliance functions are appropriately remunerated; 
  Approved the process for authorising the payments of the expenses of the Chairman and the Chief Executive;

  Kept itself abreast of the views of institutional shareholders and the special committees set up to review remuneration  
in the past year; 
  Decided on the level of annual bonus payments to be made to Executive Directors and senior managers in respect of the 
years to 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2010; 
  Decided upon the level of cash bonuses earned by senior managers (not Executive Directors) under cash-based long-term 
incentive schemes ending 31 March 2010; 
  Finalised for approval by shareholders at the 2009 Annual General Meeting the terms of the new Performance Share Plan 
( PSP') and a new Company Share Option Plan ( CSOP'); 
  Decided to whom and on what terms share awards should be made in 2009 under the PSP and CSOP with a Performance 
Period of 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2012;  
  Exercised its powers to amend the rules of the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( L-TIP') so as to permit an assessment to  
be made of performance against TSR and EPS growth targets attached to awards made under that plan, at the discretion  
of the Committee, during the final month of the three-year performance period; 
  Considered the level of vesting of the share awards made under the L-TIP in 2006 and 2007;  
  Reviewed the targets to be attached to share awards to be made in 2010; and 
  Issued shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors and other senior managers in receipt of share awards, and revised 
those guidelines. 
In deciding to permit vesting and exercise of the 2007 L-TIP awards and payment of annual and other bonuses for 
performance periods ending on 31 March 2010 during the second half of the month of March 2010, the Committee had 
before it information sufficient to make a sound judgement as to the achievement of the relevant performance targets, 
without the need to shorten the performance period. It considered that as such awards and payments related to a 
performance period that expired on 31 March 2010 it would be appropriate to allow exercise and payment a few days 
before that date so that for tax purposes the benefit would fall to be taxed in the then current tax year. The only changes 
being made were as to the timing of the assessment of performance (and release of the reward) and to use unaudited figures 
as the basis for the assessment where relevant. In assessing TSR performance for the purpose of the share awards the 
Committee had regard to the fact that this test involves the use of an averaging of share prices over 12 months so the 
Committee felt that it could assess in late March performance to the end of March with confidence. In order, however, to 
protect shareholders against the small possibility that any amounts paid exceeded the amounts that would have been paid 
had the assessments been deferred until after 31 March and fully audited results been used, each employee who received 
payment of bonus in the month of March 2010 agreed that the Company could adjust his future salary or reduce future 
bonuses if this turned out to be the case (which it did not). As regards the vesting in March 2010 of the 2007 L-TIP awards 
only 50% of the shares obtained on exercise of their awards by Peter Rogers and Bill Tame were transferred to them on an 
unrestricted basis, meaning that the other 50% cannot be sold or disposed of before 11 June 2010 and were potentially 
liable to be forfeited, in whole or part, if, had the assessment of TSR and EPS growth relevant to those awards been made 
after the end of March 2010 and using audited results, fewer shares would have vested than vested in March 2010 (which 
was not the case). 
What is the Company's remuneration policy? 
The Committee's approach to setting the structure of remuneration packages for executives is designed to underpin the 
effective and proper management of risks and challenges and to reward executive management fairly if it is successful in 
continuing the track record of strong performance and long-term growth prospects enjoyed by Babcock and its shareholders 
over recent years.  
The Committee's intention is that executives have remuneration packages that overall are fair and allow enhanced but fair 
rewards for the delivery of superior performance by allowing for the possibility of upper quartile total actual remuneration  
to be earned for upper quartile performance. As a result, base salaries for the Company's Executive Directors are around or 
below median, and there is an emphasis on the gearing of performance-related annual bonuses and share awards. The 
Committee believes this approach more closely aligns Directors' interests with those of shareholders and allows pay to be 
structured around delivery of strategic objectives and with risk and longer term consequences firmly in mind. 
In order further to align the interests of management and shareholders, the Committee adopted shareholding guidelines in 
June 2009 that expected Executive Directors (and other members of the senior management team) to hold Company shares 
derived from the net proceeds of share awards (when added 
guideline value was originally set at150%, of their base salaries. This has since been increased to 200%.  
to any purchased by them). For Executive Directors the

Linkage of remuneration to strategic objectives, risk management and its alignment with shareholder interests 
The Committee strongly believes that the remuneration of executives should be aligned with the long-term interests of 
shareholders and should support the key strategic and risk management objectives of the business. The linkage is achieved 
through the performance criteria (both financial and non-financial) used in the annual bonus and long-term incentive 
schemes. Examples include the following: 
Objective Annual bonus scheme metric Long-term incentive metric 
Delivering superior returns 
to our shareholders. 
Financial measures focused on delivery of 
sustainable year-on-year delivery of budgets  
and especially on growth by rewarding superior 
earnings and/or profits growth whilst maintaining 
strict control of cash. 
Objectives linked to improvement of the financial 
performance of specific business areas. 
 
Focus on delivery of top quartile 
performance and returns over the  
longer term. 
Developing and maintaining leading 
market positions in the UK and selected 
overseas markets. 
Specific non-financial objectives for: 
  the establishment or expansion of targeted 
domestic and overseas markets; 
  securing key business development milestones; 
  developing detailed strategic plans for expansion 
into target markets. 
 
 
Customer-focused, long-term 
relationships with strategically 
important customers. 
 
Non-financial objectives linked to measuring and 
improving customer satisfaction. 
 
Non-financial objectives: for example, the 
establishment of a more effective ongoing talent 
management and succession planning process. 
Retentive nature of the long-term schemes.
 
Development of the Group's long-term 
technical and management expertise. 
 
Retentive nature of the requirement for deferral 
into shares of 40% of annual bonuses earned by 
senior executives. 
 
 
Maintenance of an excellent health, 
safety and environmental record. 
 
General underpin giving Remuneration Committee 
complete discretion over the reduction or 
annulment of awards in the event of unsatisfactory 
performance. 
 
 
Balancing risk and reward. 
A focus on year-on-year earnings or profit growth 
remains the prominent feature of the bonus 
schemes, placing a premium on delivery of 
sustainable growth, discouraging short term risk-
taking and encouraging planning for and 
underpinning of future prospects. 
The use of financial metrics that are principally cash 
flow, profit and earnings driven rather than sales 
based discourages poor quality sales growth. 
The use of non-financial objectives reinforces links 
to key strategic steps or risk mitigation objectives. 
The requirement to defer 40% of any bonus into 
shares for two years exposes executives to the 
future impact of current year decisions. 
 
The long-term schemes and annual bonus 
schemes are mutually reinforcing, with the 
long-term schemes increasing the personal 
exposure of executives to the potentially 
negative consequences of short-term 
thinking and, as a further control, by 
requiring for full vesting superior 
performance in returns to shareholders. 
The Committee is satisfied that the incentive structure for Executive Directors does not raise environmental, social or 
governance issues by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. 
Details of the structure of the annual bonus scheme and share schemes are set out in the following pages.

Balance of remuneration 
The balance of remuneration for Executive Directors is such that the major part of overall remuneration is subject to 
achieving performance conditions over both the short and long term. The reward mix for the Chief Executive, the Finance 
Director and other Executive Directors is shown in the charts below, with long-term incentive awards being valued on a fair 
value basis. The charts assume that PSP awards over shares have a value on grant equal to 150% of the Director's basic salary. 
The charts are based on fair values of (for Peter Rogers and Bill Tame) 72% and (for Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas) 58% of 
salary for the annual bonus (including the mandatorily deferred share element as described below), and 59% of salary for the 
Performance Share Plan.  
 
Internal relativity 
The Committee is sensitive to the need to set Executive Directors' remuneration having regard to pay and conditions in  
the Group as a whole and is advised as to proposals in that regard when reviewing executive salaries. It is satisfied that  
its approach is fair and reasonable in light of current market practice and is in the best interests of shareholders.  
Basic pay 
Basic pay is considered in the general context of total remuneration at companies that are comparable in terms of size 
(market capitalisation, revenues and number of employees) and other companies in the support services sector. Against 
these data sources taken as a whole, the fair value of the Company's total remuneration is around the median and basic pay 
is below median. Basic pay is normally reviewed annually.  
The normal annual review of Executive Directors' pay for the year commencing 1 April 2009 resulted in an increase for the 
then existing Executive Directors (Peter Rogers and Bill Tame) of approximately 2%, which was in line with the increase in pay 
across the Group as a whole. For the current year commencing 1 April 2010, the Committee has approved the following: 
Director 
Basic pay  
at 1 April  
2010

 '000  
Basic pay

Peter Rogers (Chief Executive) 500  479.5
Bill Tame (Finance Director) 320  312
275  N/A
Kevin Thomas (Chief Executive, Support Services Division) 275  N/A
1. The salaries shown for Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas took effect from 1 May 2010, the date of their appointment to the Board. 
Archie Bethel (Chief Executive, Marine Division)    
 
71
The increase for Peter Rogers was approximately 4% and for Bill Tame 2.5%. The greater increase in Peter Rogers's salary was 
to take account of the fact that his basic salary had fallen relatively against sector peers. The increase of 4% still leaves him 
below that median but the Committee thought it inappropriate in the current economic climate to make any larger increase. 
Where pay increases have been approved across the wider group they have been in the order of 2%-3% depending on 
business unit. The salaries for Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas were set on their appointment to the Board on 1 May 2010. 
Performance-related rewards 
Annual bonus schemes 
Following its detailed review of the structure of remuneration carried out in early 2009 and reported on last year, and to 
meet its framework for remuneration as described above, the Committee set maximum bonus opportunity for 2009/10 for 
Peter Rogers and Bill Tame at 150% of base salary. 
Deferral: 40% of any annual bonus earned by Executive Directors and other senior executives must be deferred into Babcock 
shares for two years, with the shares being subject to potential forfeiture if the employee leaves in that time (other than by 
reason of death, disability, redundancy, retirement or the company or business in which they are employed ceasing to be 
part of the Group). The number of shares into which the bonus is deferred may be reduced by the Committee if the accounts 
by reference to which the bonus was calculated have to be materially corrected or if in the opinion of the Committee, there 
is evidence that performance against performance conditions in the bonus year, or the impact of that performance on the 
Group in respect of future financial years, was or will be materially worse than was believed to be the case at the time of the 
original assessment. The shares will carry the right to dividends paid in the period of deferral payable only when the shares 
are released. There is no provision for the Company to match these deferred shares on any basis. The deferral is purely to 
ensure that a substantial part of the Director's bonus is exposed to the longer term impact of current year decision making 
and to align them with shareholders. 
For the financial year 2009/10 the Committee set annual bonuses for Peter Rogers and Bill Tame structured as follows: 
Element (maximum as % of base salary) Performance level achieved
Peter Rogers earned 
(as a percentage of salary) 
Bill Tame earned
(as a percentage of salary)
Achieving budgeted PBT*(15%) Maximum (above budget) 15% 15%
Achieving budgeted cash flow (15%) Maximum 15% 15%
Growth in EPS** year-on-year 
(90%, for 20% growth) 
Maximum (over 20% growth) 90% 90%
Non-Financial Objectives (30%) Between target and maximum 
 85% (Rogers) 
 90% (Tame)25.5% 27%
Total (150%) 145.5% 147%
* Profit before tax (before amortisation of acquired intangibles, but, unless the Committee otherwise decides, after exceptional items). 
** Earnings per share (before amortisation of acquired intangibles, but, unless the Committee otherwise decides, after exceptional items) with maximum bonus 
only for year-on-year growth of 20% or more. 
For divisional Managing Directors the annual bonus schemes include performance measures dependent on growth in 
divisional profits and/or achievement of budgeted divisional profits and cash flow according to the objectives for the division 
concerned and have non-financial metrics forming a significant part (20%) of the bonus opportunity.  
The Committee intends to adopt a similar structure for bonus schemes for each of the Executive Directors for financial year 
2010/11, with a maximum bonus opportunity of 150% for Peter Rogers and Bill Tame and 120% for Archie Bethel and Kevin 
Thomas (although the maxima differ, each scheme will have broadly the same proportionate split between financial and  
non-financial measures).  
Long-term incentives 
Between 2003 and 2008 (inclusive), qualifying Directors and certain senior Group employees were granted performance-
related long-term incentives in the form of annual awards of nil-price options under the Babcock 2003 Long-Term Incentive 
Plan ( L-TIP'). Before 2003 they were granted performance-related market-priced share options under the Babcock 1999 
Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Option Schemes.    
 
 
 
 
 
Remuneration report continued 
 
72
Following the remuneration review last year, shareholders approved at the 2009 AGM a new 2009 Babcock Performance 
Share Plan ( PSP'). The first PSP awards were made in September 2009. PSP awards may, as was the case with the L-TIP, be 
granted in the form of performance-related, nil-cost options. They may also be combined with an award of performance-
related HMRC approved options under the new Company Share Option Plan ( CSOP') (also approved at the 2009 AGM) in 
which case the total  vesting potential across both  awards is adjusted to take account of the CSOP award. 
It is the intention of the Company that shares needed to satisfy executive options for Directors and generally awards under 
the L-TIP, CSOP and PSP will be purchased in the market to the extent that they are not already held in the Group's employee 
share trusts at the date the options or awards are granted or are exercised, unless it is in the interests of the Company to do 
otherwise and issue new shares. Details of the current holdings of shares by employee share trusts and outstanding share 
During the financial year to 31 March 2010, PSP awards were made to each of Peter Rogers and Bill Tame over shares having 
a market value on award of 150% of their qualifying basic salaries. In the same year, PSP awards and CSOP awards were made 
to Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas, who were not Directors in the year to 31 March 2010. Their respective PSP and CSOP 
awards were linked so that in each case the maximum aggregate number of shares that can be acquired on exercise of the 
two awards is limited to that number of shares that had a market value on the date of the awards (and after deducting any 
exercise price payable on exercise of the CSOP award) equal to 150% of their then base salaries.  
The vesting of these PSP awards (and, if applicable, CSOP awards) made to the Executive Directors and certain senior Group 
managers depends on Company performance. The performance criteria are set out in more detail on page 80. For certain 
other divisional senior managers, the performance targets attached to PSP Awards were set (wholly or in part) by reference 
to divisional profit targets and return on capital employed or operating cash flow, as appropriate to the division's business.  
Further details of options, L-TIP awards, PSP awards and CSOP awards held by the Directors who served during the year under 
review (Peter Rogers and Bill Tame), and the performance criteria attached to them, are set out on pages 76 to 80. 
Performance graphs 
The graphs below were prepared by Kepler Associates. They show the total shareholder return for a holding in the Company's 
shares for the period from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2010 relative to a holding of shares representing respectively the FTSE 
All-Share Index (excluding investment trusts) and the FTSE 350 Support Services Sector. The calculation of the return assumes 
dividends are reinvested to purchase additional equity. This FTSE All-Share Index (excluding investment trusts) is the same 
index as has been used for this purpose in earlier remuneration reports, as it is a broad index that allows comparison of the 
Company's performance against the performance of the stock market as a whole. Support Services is the sector in which the 
Company's share price is reported. 
Over the five-year period, the Company has significantly out-performed both indices. An investment of  100 in the Company 
on 1 April 2005 would have been worth (assuming the dividends were reinvested in further Company shares)  451 at 31 
March 2010.

Directors' pensions (audited) 
Bill Tame participated in the Group pension scheme. He receives a salary supplement for earnings in excess of the applicable 
scheme earnings cap (see further below). 
Peter Rogers receives a supplement equal to 20% of base salary in lieu of any pension benefits. It is separately identified in the 
table above. 
Supplements paid in lieu of pension do not count for share award or bonus purposes. 
2. For Peter Rogers, the entire cash allowance is pay in lieu of all pension benefits. For Bill Tame, the payment includes  25,000 in lieu of pension benefits on that 
part of his basic salary as exceeds the earnings cap for the pension scheme (see detailed explanation under Directors' pensions below) and  14,000 in respect  
of expenses connected with accommodation. 
3. 60% of the amount shown has been paid in cash. The balance of 40% is to be deferred into Company shares for two years.  
4. For Bill Tame benefits comprised medical insurance, home to work travel expenses and accommodation benefits. For Peter Rogers, they comprised medical

Babcock International Group Pension Scheme ( the Scheme') (audited) 
Bill Tame is a member of the senior executive tier of the Babcock International Group Pension Scheme. 
The accrual rate for him under the Scheme is one-thirtieth of salary within the applicable Scheme earnings cap for each year 
of service. Pension is calculated on his base salary up to the earnings cap in the 12 months prior to retirement at age 60 or 
above. Membership of the Scheme also entitles him to life assurance cover of four times base salary up to the earnings cap. 
The earnings cap adopted by the Scheme is the same as the former statutory earnings cap, index-linked in the same way.  
The Company takes out additional life assurance cover in respect of four times his salary in excess of the earnings cap.  
Bill Tame's pension entitlements under the Scheme (defined benefit) are set out in the following table:

1. Inflation has been taken as 3.4% for the purposes of calculating increases in transfer values and pension earned. 
2. The transfer value of the increase in pension accrued is calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11, and is stated after deducting members' 
contributions. 
3. The figures in the above table make no allowance for the cost of death in service benefits under the Scheme. 
4. The figures in the above table make no allowance for any benefits in respect of earnings in excess of the Inland Revenue earnings cap. 
5. In calculating the above figures no account has been taken of any retained benefits which he may have from previous employments. 
6. No payments have been made to retired Directors in excess of the retirement benefit to which they were entitled on the date the benefits first became payable 
or, if later, 31 March 1997. 
(Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas, who were not Directors in the year under review, each only having become a Director on  
1 May 2010, are members of the executive tier of the Scheme. They will accrue pension at the rate of one-forty-fifth of salary 
within the Scheme earnings cap applicable to them for each year of service. Pension is calculated on their base salaries (up to 
the earnings cap applicable to them) in the 12 months prior to retirement at age 65 or above. Membership of the Scheme 
also entitles them to life assurance cover of four times base salary up to the earnings cap. The Company takes out additional 
life assurance cover in respect of four times their salaries in excess of their earnings cap. They also each receive a salary 
supplement of 15% (including employer's national insurance contributions) of the excess of their earnings over the applicable 
Scheme earnings cap only contributing into the Company's pension scheme on their capped salaries. These supplements do 
not count for share award or bonus purposes.) 
Other pension arrangements (audited) 
Before 1 April 2006, the Company provided a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme (FURBS) for Bill Tame in 
respect of his salary in excess of the earnings cap. The Company contributed to the FURBS an amount equal to 20% of the 
excess (including employer's national insurance contributions), with him making contributions into the Company's pension 
scheme on his full uncapped salary. As from April 2006, this was replaced with a salary supplement of 15% of the excess 
(including employer's national insurance contributions), with him contributing into the Company's pension scheme only on 
capped salary. The value of this supplement in the year to 31 March 2010 was  25,000.

Directors' interests in shares (audited) 
The table below shows the holdings of fully paid ordinary shares of 60p each of the Directors who served in the year  
to 31 March 2010 or who hold office at the date of this Report (including family interests) in the issued share capital of the 
Company. The interests were beneficial interests. 
As noted above, the Committee's shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors is to build and maintain, over time,  
a personal (and/or spousal) holding of shares in the Company equivalent in value to at least twice their annual basic salary 
(increased from last year's guideline of one and a half year's pay). The revised guidelines also now state that normally  
(and subject to the Committee's discretion to allow a dispensation) an Executive Director is expected to retain at least half  
of any shares acquired on the exercise of a share award that remain after the sale of sufficient shares to cover tax and 
national insurance triggered by the exercise (and associated dealing costs) until the guideline level is achieved and  
thereafter maintained. The Executive Directors currently meet these guidelines.

1. The information for Kevin Thomas is as regards the position at 1 May 2010, the date on which he took office as a Director. 
These options vested according to comparative TSR performance over a three-year performance period. They were not 
subject to re-testing. The comparator group was the companies in the FTSE Engineering and Machinery Sector when the 
options were granted (which was the sector in which the Company's shares were then listed). There was no vesting unless 
the Company ranked above median performance, in which case 25% of the options vested. Full vesting was for top quartile 
ranking with proportionate vesting on a straight-line basis for a ranking between those points.  
The exercise price was set at the average of the mid-market closing price of the Company's shares for the three business days 
preceding the date of the grant. This price was not discounted. 
The options must be exercised before the tenth anniversary of the grant date, or earlier if there is a change of control, 
the Director leaves or dies, failing which they will lapse.  
There were no changes in the above stated option position between 31 March 2010 and 10 May 2010.

1. The date on which Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas took office as Directors. 
The vesting of the above CSOP awards is subject to performance measures which are identical to those for the PSP awards 
granted to the above Directors on the same date. Details of those PSP awards and measures are set out on pages 78 and 80. 
The provisions of these CSOP options and those PSP Awards (i.e. those granted on 11 September 2009 to Archie Bethel and 
Kevin Thomas) are linked so that the maximum aggregate number of shares that can be acquired on exercise of the two 
awards is limited to that number of shares that had a market value on the date of the awards (and after deducting any 
exercise price payable on exercise of the CSOP award) equal to 150% of their then base salaries (the  Limit'). If there is less 
than full vesting, it is possible for the Director to choose to exercise the CSOP to its fullest extent within the Limit and then  
to exercise the PSP Award to the extent of any balance left within the Limit.

1. Exercise details in the table below. 
2. For Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas, the information given is as at and from 1 May 2010 when they took office as Directors. 
3. The 2006 and 2007 L-TIP awards became fully vested and exercisable on 28 May 2009 and 26 March 2010 respectively having met the TSR and EPS 
approved by the Committee as described on page 68 above, this can be, at the option of the Remuneration Committee, either in the final month of the 
performance period or after the announcement of results for the final year of the performance period. The above table assumes (unless stated otherwise) that 
the announcement is normally made in May and notification of vesting given in the same month. The Committee exercised the discretion to allow vesting and 
exercise of the 2007 LTIP in March 2010 as explained on page 68. However 50% of the shares obtained by Peter Rogers and Bill Tame on exercise are subject to 
restrictions on disposal until 11 June 2010 as also described on page 68. 
The performance criteria attached to those of the above awards that have vested (namely those made in 2006 and 2007) 
were that half of the shares vested based on comparative TSR performance and half according to growth in earnings per 
share (EPS). For the TSR element, a ranking in the upper quartile (which was achieved) resulted in 100% vesting. The TSR 
calculation used a 12-month average for share prices adjusted for dividends paid during the period. The comparator group  
of listed companies for the 2006 award comprised AEA Technology, W.S. Atkins, Aggreko, Amec, Bodycote, Capita, Carillion, 
Cobham, Interserve, Laing (John), Mitie, Mouchel-Parkman, Rentokil Initial, Serco, VT Group and WSP Group. The comparator 
group for the awards made in 2007 comprised AEA Technology, W.S. Atkins, Aggreko, Amec, Bodycote, Capita, Carillion, 
Cobham, Interserve, Mitie, Mouchel-Parkman, Rentokil Initial, Serco, VT Group, WSP Group, Weir Group, Ashtead Group, Alfred 
McAlpine and Davis Service Group. For the other half of the 2006 and 2007 awards, vesting depended on growth in EPS 
(adjusted to exclude exceptional items and acquired intangible amortisation) over the performance period, with full vesting 
(which was achieved) where growth equalled or exceeded a real (i.e. growth in excess of the increase in the consumer prices 
index) compound annual growth rate of 8%.  
The performance criteria attached to the unvested 2008 award are described further below on page 79.

The number of shares sold on exercise of the L-TIP awards by the above Directors were in each case just sufficient to cover 
income tax and employee national insurance charges arising on exercise, and dealing costs.  
The Company's mid-market share price at close of business on 31 March 2010 was 602.50p. The highest and lowest  
mid-market share prices in the year ended 31 March 2010 were 642.00p and 399.50p respectively. 
The L-TIP awards that vested during the year to 31 March 2010 were those granted in July 2006 and July 2007. The market 
value of those shares on award was 339.50p and 547.00p per share respectively. 
On the date of vesting of the 2006 L-TIP award on 28 May 2009, the vested shares had a market value of 472.50p per share, 
being the mid-market closing price on that day. 
On the date of vesting of the 2007 L-TIP award on 26 March 2010, the vested shares had a market value of 578.50p per 
share, being the mid-market closing price on that day.

1. For Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas, the information given is as at and from 1 May 2010 when they took office as Directors. 
2. The expiry date can be extended by the Remuneration Committee to up to ten years from the date of grant, i.e. 2019. 
Under the rules of the Plan, the Committee may designate a  Notional Award Date' which is the date the award would 
have been made but for the Company being in a  restricted period' at that time, which was the case with these awards 
(their Notional Award Date being16 July 2009).   All the L-TIP and PSP awards made to date to the current Directors have been made by the trustee of the Babcock Employee 
Share Trust as nil-cost options. The number of shares awarded under the outstanding unvested L-TIP awards had a value equal 
to 100% of the Director's qualifying annual salary at the date of the award and those awarded under the PSP had a value on 
award of 150% of that salary (value calculated in each case using the average of the mid-market closing price of the 
Company's shares for the three business days preceding the award date). 
Subject to satisfaction of the performance criteria attached to the L-TIP and PSP awards (see below), the Directors may call 
for the release to them of the award shares during the respective exercise periods. Subject to the rules of the plan, an earlier 
release of shares under unvested awards may be allowed by the Remuneration Committee (for example, in the event of a 
cessation of employment or a change in control), but (unless the Committee otherwise decides) of not more than a time-
apportioned proportion and then only having regard to the Company's performance, though the Committee has discretion 
to allow a greater proportion to be released. 
The performance conditions attached to the as yet unvested L-TIP and PSP awards are described below. 
Performance is judged over the period of three financial years from the start of the financial year in which the award is made. 
Performance is measured at the end of the period and is not re-tested. The following two tables explain the targets attached 
to as yet unvested awards. (The tests applied to L-TIP awards that have previously vested but not yet been exercised are 
described under the table on page 77 above.)

Notes:  
EPS is adjusted to exclude exceptional items and acquired intangible amortisation. 
Real EPS growth is that in excess of the change in the consumer prices index. 
For the comparative TSR test, the comparator group of companies for the 2008 awards comprised the constituents of the 
FTSE 350 Support Services Index as at the date of grant - this was a peer group in the same FTSE sector as the Company  
and was chosen pending the full review of longer term incentives and the appropriate peer group going forward which was 
carried out in 2008/09.

Notes: 
Participants will be entitled to a vesting of shares under the TSR element only to the extent the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the recorded TSR 
is a genuine reflection of the underlying performance of the Company over the performance period. 
EPS is adjusted to exclude acquired intangible amortisation, but, unless the Committee decides otherwise, includes exceptional items. 
Real EPS growth is that in excess of the change in the retail prices index. 
The share awards carry the right to receive on vesting any dividends that would have been paid in the period between grant and vesting (or, if the Committee so 
decides, a number of shares having a market value equivalent to the amount of the dividends when the dividend would have been paid), but this right applies only 
to the shares that actually vest under the award. The Committee intends that the current awards will receive such entitlement, if any, in cash. 
For the TSR element, the peer group is the FTSE 350 (excluding investment trusts and financial services). This group was 
chosen after careful review due to the fact that Babcock's closest peers straddle multiple sectors, not just support services, 
and the broader group makes the calibration more robust. 
The charts below illustrate the proposed vesting schedules for each element of the 2010 PSP award:

The 2009 PSP awards (Performance period 1 April 2009-31 March 2012) 
Proposed PSP awards to be made in 2010    
 
81
The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance conditions to be attached to future PSP awards prior to the start  
of each cycle to ensure they remain appropriate. No material reduction in targets would be made without prior consultation 
with shareholders. 
Following a review ahead of any awards being made in 2010, the Committee has decided that for awards to which Company 
TSR and EPS growth performance measures are attached (which will include those made to Executive Directors) the 
approach taken shall be as used for the PSP awards made in 2009, but with maximum vesting in respect of the EPS growth 
test only if real annual compound growth is 12.5% or more over the performance period (1 April 2010 to 31 March 2013). 
This represents an increase from the 11% (real) target applied to the 2009 awards. The proposed measures are shown in the 
charts on page 80. 
Why TSR and EPS for Executive Directors' share awards? 
The Committee considers the use of two measures, in the proportions used for the LTIP and PSP awards described in the 
tables above, to be appropriate. The TSR performance measure is dependent on the Company's relative long-term share 
price performance and so provides strong alignment with shareholders' interests. The TSR calculation for both the LTIP and 
PSP awards would normally use a 12-month average for opening and closing share prices adjusted for dividends paid during 
the period. The Company feels that this is the most appropriate period because a 12-month average ensures both that the 
short-term market volatility is excluded and that for each company a 12-month period will capture the impact of the 
announcement of results and payment of dividends. A shorter period would not capture all these events and would not 
necessarily put all companies on an equal footing. 
TSR is used in conjunction with EPS growth, which is the primary internal benchmark of financial performance and ties  
in with the Company's strategic goals.  
Service contracts 
The following table summarises the key terms (apart from as to remuneration, on which see above) of the Directors' service 
contracts or terms of appointment: 
Executive Directors 
Name Date of service contract Notice period
Contractual 
retirement age
Peter Rogers

Kevin Thomas 
(Chief Executive, Support Services Division) 
20 April 2010 12 months from Company, 
6 months from Director
65
The Company's policy is that Executive Directors' service contracts should be capable of being terminated by the Company 
on not more than 12 months' notice.  
If the Company terminates a Director's service contract the Company will have regard to all the circumstances in 
determining the amount of compensation, including as to the scope for mitigation, if any, payable to him in connection  
with that termination. 
The agreements for Peter Rogers and Bill Tame (but not the agreements for Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas) contain 
provisions that provide that within 90 days of the occurrence of the change of control, each may terminate his employment 
forthwith. If he exercises this right, he is entitled, for a 12-month period, to be paid (on a monthly basis) his basic salary plus 
40% (compared to a maximum entitlement under the annual bonus scheme of 150%) in lieu of bonus and all other 
contractual entitlements. From this there is to be deducted any amount that the Director receives by way of income,  
if it exceeds 10% of his Babcock salary, from other sources that he would not have been able to earn had he continued  
in employment with the Company.

The agreements for  Peter Rogers and Bill Tame (but not the agreements for Kevin Thomas and Archie Bethel) also provide 
that if the Company terminates their  appointment within12 months of a change of control, they would be entitled to  
a termination payment equal to 100% of annual salary (plus 40% in lieu of bonus and all other benefits).

* The Company's policy is for Non-Executive Directors to have written terms of appointment normally for no more than three-year terms at a time; however, 
in all cases appointments are terminable at will at any time by the Company or the Director.  
The latest written terms of appointment are available for inspection at the Company's registered office and at the Company's 
Annual General Meeting. The expected time commitment of Non-Executive Directors is set out in their current written terms 
of appointment.  
Outside directorships 
Before taking up any new outside appointment, an Executive Director must first seek the approval of the Chairman. Any fees 
for outside appointments are retained by the Director. Peter Rogers is a Non-Executive Director of Galliford Try plc. During 
the year to 31 March 2010 he received  38,000 by way of fees for that role. Bill Tame is a Non-Executive Director of Carclo 
PLC. During the period year to 31 March 2010 his fees for that role were  26,500.
