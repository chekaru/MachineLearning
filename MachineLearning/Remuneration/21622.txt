Remuneration report
Annual Remuneration Committee Chairman Statement 
Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to present the Directors' Remuneration report for 2013/14 for which we will be seeking your approval at the 
Annual General Meeting on Monday, 21 July 2014.
The Committee has had a full agenda during the year, and continues to ensure the Directors' remuneration policy is in line with 
evolving corporate governance requirements, is aligned with Company strategy, and rewards the right behaviours, helping to 
ensure we do what is right for our customers, and drive sustainable value for our shareholders. The changes made to our 
remuneration structure over the past few years mean that we are in a position to propose a policy for the next three years 
that is in line with that operated in 2013/14. Our remuneration structure remains weighted toward rewarding success over 
a multi-year period and signifi cant equity related components, which the Committee strongly believes is appropriate for our 
business and our future success, as well as aligning the interests of shareholders and management.
Over recent years the shareholdings and equity-related interests of our senior management (as a group) have increased 
signifi cantly as has the number of employees with equity interests in the Company. During the year the Committee considered 
the shareholding guidelines applicable to senior management as it considers this an important element of the remuneration 
arrangements but given the level of shareholdings and interests generally, felt it unnecessary to modify these at this time other 
than for the Chief Executive.
Remuneration in 2013/14
Following consultation with shareholders on a number of matters, as disclosed in last year's report, and as part of the annual 
granting process, the PSP and DBMP targets for the 2013 awards were reviewed and the Committee reduced the top-end EPS 
target for the 2013 PSP and DBMP awards and increased the three-year average ROCE targets for the 2013 DBMP to ensure 
they remained appropriate and challenging at the time of grant. Awards were made at the same level as 2012 awards, and 
the performance period ends on 31 March 2016.
The Company continues to perform at a high level, delivering once again record results for the fi nancial year. These results 
reinforce the Board's belief in the Company's strategy, and give the Committee the reassurance that the executive incentives 
are driving the right behaviours, and are rewarding the executive team appropriately. This performance over the year resulted 
in annual bonus payments of between 92% and 94% of maximum, and sustained performance over the last 3 years has resulted 
in 93.0% vesting of the PSP (94.7% for the CEO's awards), with relative TSR performance ahead of the stretching targets and EPS 
performance in the performance range set by the Committee in 2011.

Introduction
Remuneration Committee
Terms of reference for the Remuneration Committee 
(Committee) have been approved by the Board. Duties of the 
Committee include the determination of the policy for the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors and the Chairman, as 
well as their specifi c remuneration packages, including pension 
rights and, where applicable, any compensation payments. In 
determining the remuneration policy, the Committee takes into 
account all factors which it deems necessary to ensure that 
members of the senior executive management of the Group 
are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage strong 
performance and that they are rewarded for their individual 
contributions to the success of the Company, in a fair and 
responsible manner.
The composition of the Committee and its terms of reference 
comply with the provisions of the Corporate Governance Code. 
The terms of reference are available for inspection on the 
Company's website.
Compliance statement
This report covers the reporting period from 1 April 2013 
to 31 March 2014 and provides details of the Committee 
membership, details of their deliberation on executive 
remuneration during the year under review and remuneration 
policy for the Company. This report has been prepared by the 
Committee according to the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 (the Act), Regulation 11 and Schedule 8 of the Large and 
Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 (the Regulations) and other 
relevant requirements of the FCA Listing Rules. In addition, 
the Committee has applied the principles of good corporate 
governance set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
and has considered guidelines issued by its leading shareholders 
and bodies such as the Association of British Insurers and the 
National Association of Pension Funds. In accordance with 
Section 439 and 439A of the Act, a binding resolution to 
approve the Policy Report and an advisory resolution to approve 
the Annual Report on Remuneration will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting on 21 July 2014, from which date 
the Policy will, if approved, take effect. This report contains 
both auditable and non-auditable information. The information 
subject to audit is so marked. The Regulations require the 
Company's auditors to report that the  Audited information' 
in this report has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Regulations.
Key principles of the remuneration policy
Objective
To provide fair remuneration arrangements that allow for 
enhanced rewards for delivery of superior performance by 
allowing for the possibility of upper quartile rewards for upper 
quartile performance, that align Directors' and shareholders' 
interests and take account of risk.
Our policy for executives refl ects a preference that we believe is 
shared by the majority of our shareholders - to rely more heavily 
on the value of variable performance-related rewards, rather 
than on the fi xed elements of pay. The rationale is to incentivise 
and reward success.
Weighting towards long-term, performance-related pay
The focus of our executive remuneration is, therefore, 
weighted towards performance-related pay (with a signifi cant 
element weighted towards long-term rather than short-term 
performance). We believe that, properly structured and with 
suitable safeguards, variable, performance-related rewards are 
the best way of linking pay to strategy, risk management and 
shareholders' interests.
Remuneration for 2014/15
The remuneration policy for 2014/15 remains unchanged from 2013/14. Following a number of necessary changes to 
remuneration arrangements in recent years, the Remuneration Committee has not proposed any changes to the remuneration 
structures, and incentive opportunities remain at the same levels as in 2013/14. Whilst the Committee intends to measure 
performance for the annual bonus, PSP and DBMP against similar measures to prior years, in light of the acquisition of Avincis 
Group, the annual bonus targets and DBMP ROCE targets may require review in the coming year to ensure they remain 
appropriate, motivating and suffi ciently stretching. The incentive targets for the PSP for both EPS and TSR performance remain 
appropriate and are unchanged from 2013/14.
The Committee reviewed Executive Director base salaries during the year, and following the required adjustment to salaries in 
2013, determined that salaries for Executive Directors should be increased in line with those for the wider Group for 2014/15. 
The Remuneration Committee was informed by the Executive Directors that exceptionally they would not be drawing the 
increase granted for 2014/15 in order to demonstrate their understanding of the fi nancial austerity still affecting the 
government as their principal customer. Whilst that one-year restraint was welcomed, the Committee is aware of the need to 
ensure that remuneration continues to be appropriately competitive going forward to ensure that we can meet our stated 
remuneration policy, and therefore agreed that the increase made for 2014/15 (2.5%) would be included in the baseline for 
their next review in 2015.
The Remuneration Report
In line with the new reporting regulations that came into effect on 1 October 2013, this Directors' Remuneration Report is split 
into three parts: this Annual Statement, a Policy Report and an Annual Report on Remuneration. These sections work together 
to give you full and transparent disclosure of the Company's intention and operation of Directors' remuneration, and build upon 
some of the disclosures adopted early in last year's Remuneration Report. At the AGM, a binding shareholder vote will be sought 
for the future Policy section and an advisory shareholder vote for the Annual Report on Remuneration section.

i) Directors' Remuneration Policy
Summary of Babcock's remuneration policy for Executive Directors
Purpose and link to strategy Operation
Fixed pay
Base salary
Should be at a level that is (i) fair and 
(ii) capable, when taken with the 
gearing effect of performance-related 
pay, of delivering upper quartile 
actual remuneration for upper 
quartile performance.
Base salaries are reviewed annually, with reference to the individual's role, experience and performance; salary levels at relevant 
comparators are considered but do not in themselves drive decision-making.
Pension
To provide market competitive 
retirement benefi ts.
Cash supplement in lieu wholly or partly of pension benefi ts for ongoing service and/or membership of the group's Defi ned 
Benefi t or Defi ned Contribution pension scheme.
Benefi ts
Designed to be competitive in the 
market in which the individual is 
employed or to meet costs effectively 
incurred at the Company's request.
A range of benefi ts are provided which may include life insurance; medical insurance; car and fuel benefi ts and allowances; 
home to work travel and related costs if agreed on an individual basis or if incurred at the request of the Company; 
accommodation benefi ts and related costs if based away from home at the request of the Company; Board function related 
costs; and, in certain circumstances, cash allowances in respect of the tax charge on accommodation or travel to work benefi t 
if incurred at the request of the Company or with its prior approval.
Other benefi ts (e.g. relocation) may be offered if considered appropriate and reasonable by the Committee.
Variable pay
Annual bonus
To underpin delivery of year-on-year 
fi nancial performance and progress 
towards strategic non-fi nancial 
objectives, being structured to 
motivate delivery against targets 
and achievement of stretching 
outperformance, whilst mindful of 
achievement of long-term strategy 
and longer term risks to the Company.
The requirement to defer a substantial 
part of bonus into Babcock shares 
strengthens the link to long-term 
sustainable growth.
Performance targets are set at the start of the year and refl ect the responsibilities of the executive in relation to the delivery of 
our strategy.
At the end of the year, the Committee determines the extent to which these targets have been achieved. The Committee has 
the discretion to adjust the outcome (up or down) within the limits of the plan for corporate transactions, unforeseen events, 
factors outside reasonable management control, changes to business priorities or operational arrangements, to ensure targets 
represent and remain a fair measure of performance. In addition, the Committee considers health and safety performance and 
it may reduce or cancel any annual bonus otherwise payable if it considers it appropriate to do so in light of that performance.
At least 40% of annual bonus payments for Executive Directors must be deferred into awards over Company shares for three 
years under the DBMP. Mandatory deferred bonus awards (Deferred annual bonus) are subject to potential forfeiture if the 
holder leaves before the awards vest. Clawback applies to unvested deferred annual bonuses if the accounts used to determine 
the bonus level have to be materially corrected or the Committee subsequently comes to a view that bonus year performance 
was materially worse than originally believed or will have material adverse impacts in future years.
Deferred bonus matching plan (DBMP) 
To ensure that a substantial part of the 
Directors' short-term incentive rewards 
is exposed to the longer-term impact of 
decision-making and to further align 
their interests with shareholders.
The Committee may grant performance-related matching awards to Executive Directors who are granted deferred 
bonus awards.
Participants can make an investment (including by voluntary extra deferral of bonus) regardless of any annual bonus earned of 
up to 100% of salary (including mandatory and voluntary investment). Participants may make an additional voluntary investment 
of up to 40% of salary.
An additional benefi t is provided in cash or shares equal to dividends that would have been paid over the vesting period on 
shares that vest.
The Committee has the ability to exercise discretion to override the DBMP matching outcome in circumstances where 
application of the formula would produce a result inconsistent with the Company's remuneration principles.
Performance Share Plan (PSP) and 
Company Share Option Plan (CSOP)
To incentivise delivery of top quartile 
shareholder returns and earnings growth 
over the longer term. 
Long-term measures guard against 
short-term steps being taken to 
maximise annual rewards at the expense 
of future performance.
The Remuneration Committee has the ability to grant nil-cost options or conditional share awards under the PSP, and may grant 
a portion of an award in CSOP options. To date, the Remuneration Committee has only awarded nil-cost options and CSOP 
options to executives.
The award levels and performance conditions on which vesting depends are reviewed from time to time to ensure they remain 
appropriate.
An additional benefi t is provided in cash or shares equal to dividends that would have been paid over the vesting period on 
shares that vest.
Options may also be granted under the CSOP, an HMRC approved option scheme, which have an exercise price based on market 
price at the award date and can be linked to PSP awards as explained further on page 115, but are otherwise the same as for 
PSP awards.
The Committee has the ability to exercise discretion to override the PSP outcome in circumstances where strict application of 
the performance conditions would produce a result inconsistent with the Company's remuneration principles. 
All-employee plans - Babcock Employee 
Share Plan
To encourage employee ownership of 
Babcock shares.
Open to all UK tax resident employees of participating Group companies. Executive Directors are eligible to participate.
The plan is an HMRC approved share incentive plan that allows an employee to purchase shares (through the plan trustees) out 
of pre tax salary which, if held for periods of time approved by HMRC (currently 3 to 5 years), are taxed on a favourable basis.
The Company can match purchased shares with an award of free shares. Matching shares are forfeited if employees leave within 
three years of their award (other than for  good leaver' reasons).

Opportunity Performance metrics
In respect of existing Executive Directors, it is anticipated that decisions on any salary 
increases will be guided by the increases for the wider employee population over the 
term of this policy. In certain circumstances (including, but not limited to, a material 
increase in job size or complexity, market forces, promotion or recruitment) the 
Committee has discretion to make appropriate adjustments to salary levels to ensure 
they remain fair and competitive.
Latest salaries are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 100.
Business and individual performance are considerations in setting base salary.
Executive Directors, other than John Davies, currently receive a cash supplement of 
25% of base pay in lieu of pension benefi ts. John Davies is a member of the Babcock 
International Group Pension Scheme (which offers 1/60th accrual) and receives a cash 
supplement, currently 20% of base pay above the scheme earnings cap.
The cash supplement payable, whether in lieu of all pension benefi ts or on pay in excess 
of any applicable scheme earnings cap, and the level of any employer contribution 
into a defi ned contribution pension scheme for Executive Directors is set having regard 
to market practice, and in the context of the other elements of the remuneration 
package, notably base salary. Other than in exceptional cases (such as to replace 
existing arrangements for new recruits) the Committee does not anticipate employer 
contributions into a defi ned contribution pension scheme or cash in lieu of benefi t as 
being at a cost to the Company that would exceed 30% of base salary or, in the case 
of internal promotions to the Board or for Executive Directors subsequently leaving 
existing Group pension schemes, in excess of the cost to the Company as a percentage 
of base salary of their current pension provision.
Not performance related.
Benefi t values vary by role and are periodically reviewed and set at a level which the 
Committee considers appropriate in light of relevant market practice for the role and 
individual circumstances.
The cost of the benefi ts provided changes in accordance with market conditions and 
will, therefore, determine the maximum amount that would be paid in the form of 
benefi ts during the period of this policy. The Committee retains the discretion to 
approve a higher cost in certain circumstances (e.g. relocation) or in circumstances 
where factors outside the Company's control have changed materially.
Not performance related.
Maximum bonus opportunity is 150% of salary.
For achievement of threshold, up to 15% of maximum bonus is earned; for achievement 
of target up to 55% of maximum bonus is earned.
Performance is determined by the Committee on an annual basis by reference 
to Group and/or Divisional fi nancial measures, e.g. EPS growth, PBIT, PBT, OCF, 
as well as the achievement of non-fi nancial objectives.
The fi nancial and personal/strategic objectives are typically weighted 80% and 
20% of maximum, respectively.
The Committee retains discretion to vary the weightings +/- 20% for individual 
measures within the fi nancial element at the start of each year, to ensure 
alignment with the business priorities for the year. 
Measures used for the 2013/14 annual bonus and proposed for 2014/15 are 
included in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The maximum match would be 2 for 1 on any shares held under the DBMP (up to a 
maximum of 200% of salary based on maximum voluntary investment).
For each performance condition applying to matching awards, 12.5% of the maximum 
award will vest for threshold performance.
Vesting of DBMP awards is subject to continued employment and Company 
performance over a 3 year performance period.
Awards in recent cycles have been based on the achievement of stretching EPS, 
TSR and/or ROCE targets. The Committee will review the performance measures, 
their weightings, and performance targets annually to ensure continued 
alignment with Company strategy. Should the Committee make changes to the 
measures, the weighting on EPS, TSR and ROCE combined will be not less than 
66% of the total award.
Details of measures and targets used for specifi c DBMP grants are included in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Maximum annual PSP awards of up to 200% of base pay (though currently only the 
Chief Executive receives awards at this level). 
For each performance condition applying to an award, 16.7% of the maximum award 
will vest for threshold performance.
Vesting of PSP awards is subject to continued employment and Company 
performance over a 3 year performance period.
Awards in recent cycles have been based on the achievement of stretching EPS 
and TSR targets. The Committee will review the performance measures, their 
weightings, and performance targets annually to ensure continued alignment

the weighting on EPS and/or TSR combined will be not less than 66% of the 
total award.
Details of measures and targets used for specifi c PSP and CSOP grants are 
included in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Participants can purchase shares up to the prevailing HMRC limit at the time employees 
are invited to participate.
The Company currently offers to match purchases made through the plan at the rate of 
1 free matching share for every 10 shares purchased. The matching rate is reviewed 
periodically, and any future offer will be bound by the prevailing HMRC limit.

Notes to the policy table
Payments from existing awards and commitments
Executive Directors are eligible to receive payment from any 
award or other commitment made prior to the approval 
and implementation of the remuneration policy detailed in 
this report. 
Performance measure selection and approach to 
target setting
The measures used under annual bonus schemes are selected 
annually to refl ect the Group's main strategic objectives for 
the year and refl ect both fi nancial and non-fi nancial priorities. 
Performance targets are set to be stretching but achievable, 
taking into account the Company's strategic priorities and the 
economic environment in which the Company operates. 
Financial targets are set taking into account a range of reference 
points including the Group's strategic and operating plan. 
The Committee considers at length the appropriate fi nancial 
conditions and non-fi nancial objectives to attach to annual 
bonus awards and the fi nancial targets to attach to share awards 
to ensure they continue to be: (i) relevant to our strategic 
objectives and aligned with shareholders' interests mindful 
of risk management; and (ii) fair by being suitably stretching 
whilst realistic.
The Committee believes that Total Shareholder Return (TSR), 
Underlying Earnings per Share (EPS) and Return on Capital 
Employed (ROCE) continue to be effective measures of 
long-term performance for the Company, providing a good 
balance between shareholder value creation and line of sight 
for executives.
The TSR performance measure is tested by reference to the 
Company's relative long-term share price performance against 
suitable peers. The Committee believes that the use of relative 
TSR provides strong alignment with shareholders' interests by 
incentivising management for the delivery of above market 
returns. The TSR calculation would normally use a 12-month 
average for opening and closing share prices adjusted for 
dividends paid during the period. The Company feels that this 
is the most appropriate period because a 12-month average 
ensures both that short-term market volatility is excluded 
and that for each company a 12-month period will capture 
the impact of the announcement of results and payment 
of dividends. A shorter period would not capture all these 
events and would not necessarily put all companies on an 
equal footing.
The use of an EPS growth performance measure, in the opinion 
of the Committee, focuses management on continued strong 
fi nancial performance and is heavily dependent on the 
Company's success in achieving its strategic goals.
The Committee believes that ROCE reinforces the focus on 
returns for shareholders and encourages capital discipline. 
It also provides good line of sight for management.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to make 
adjustments to the calculation of short and long-term 
performance outcomes in circumstances where application 
of the formula would produce a result inconsistent with the 
Company's remuneration principles. Such circumstances may 
include: changes in accounting standards, certain major 
corporate events such as rights issues, share buybacks, special 
dividends, corporate restructurings, acquisitions and disposals.
The Committee reviews the performance conditions for share 
awards prior to the start of each cycle to ensure they remain 
appropriate. No material reduction in long-term incentive 
targets for future awards would be made without prior 
consultation with our major shareholders.
Differences between Executive Director and general 
employee remuneration
The policy and practice with regard to the remuneration of 
senior executives below the Board is consistent with that for the 
Executive Directors. Senior executives generally participate in 
the same long-term incentives as the Executive Directors with 
similar performance measures applied. The remuneration policy 
for our Executive Directors is considered with the remuneration 
philosophy and principles that underpin remuneration for the 
wider Group in mind. The remuneration arrangements for other 
employees refl ect local market practice and seniority of each 
role. As a result, the levels and structure of remuneration for 
different groups of employees will differ from the policy for 
executives as set out above but with the common intention that 
remuneration arrangements for all groups might reasonably be 
considered to be fair having regard to such factors. Governance

Approach to recruitment remuneration
Recruitment policy
In the cases of hiring or appointing a new Executive Director, the Committee may make use of any of the existing components of 
remuneration, as follows:
Pay element Policy on recruitment Maximum
Salary Based on size and nature of responsibilities of the proposed role; the candidate's 
experience; implications for total remuneration positioning vs. market pay levels for 
comparable roles; internal relativities; and the candidate's current salary
n/a
Pension Membership of pension scheme or salary supplement on a similar basis to other 
executives, as described in the policy table
n/a
Benefi ts Provision of benefi ts on a similar basis to other executives, as described in the 
policy table
n/a
Annual bonus As described in the policy table, and may be pro-rated for proportion of year served 150% of salary
Deferred Bonus 
Matching Plan
New appointees may participate in the DBMP on similar terms to other executives 200% of salary
Performance Share 
Plan and Company 
Share Option Plan 
(CSOP)
New appointees may be granted awards under the PSP on similar terms to 
other executives
200% of salary
Other In determining appropriate remuneration for new Executive Directors, the Committee 
will take into consideration all relevant factors (including quantum, the nature of 
remuneration and where the candidate was recruited from) to ensure that arrangements 
are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Committee may also 
make an award in respect of a new appointment to  replace' incentive arrangements 
forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing so, the Committee will consider 
relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, time 
to vesting and the likelihood of those conditions being met. The fair value of the 
compensatory award would not be greater than the awards being replaced. In order to 
facilitate like-for-like compensatory awards on recruitment, the Committee may avail 
itself of Listing Rule 9.4.2R if required
n/a
Other recruitment events
Internal promotion When appointing a new Executive Director by way of promotion from an internal role, 
the Committee will be consistent with the policy for external hires detailed above. 
Where an individual has contractual commitments, outstanding incentive awards and/or 
pension arrangements prior to their promotion to Executive Director, the Company may 
honour those arrangements; however, where appropriate, these would be expected to 
transition over time to the arrangements as stated above
n/a
Non-Executive 
Director
When recruiting a new Non-Executive Director, the Committee or Board will structure 
pay in line with the existing policy, namely a base fee in line with the current fee 
schedule, with additional fees for fulfi lling the role of Senior Independent Director 
and Chairmanship of the Audit and Risk and Remuneration Committees

Balance of remuneration for Executive Directors
The charts below provide an estimate of the potential future 
reward opportunities for the Executive Directors, and the 
potential split between the different elements of remuneration 
under three different performance scenarios:  Minimum', 
 On-target' and  Maximum'.
Potential reward opportunities are based on Babcock's 
remuneration policy, applied to base salaries as at 1 April 2014. 
Note that the projected values exclude the impact of any share 
price movements. For this reason, were the DBMP or PSP shares 
to vest in full, actual total remuneration may exceed the value 
shown in the chart below.

The  Minimum' scenario shows base salary, pension (and/or 
pay in lieu of pension) and benefi ts (i.e. fi xed remuneration). 
These are the only elements of the Executive Directors' 
remuneration packages which are not at risk.
The  On-Target' scenario refl ects fi xed remuneration as above, 
plus a payout of 50% of the annual bonus for the CEO and CFO 
(52.7% for the other Executive Directors) and threshold vesting 
of 12.5% and 16.7% of the maximum award under the DBMP 
and PSP, respectively. All scenarios assume full voluntary 
investment under the DBMP.
The  Maximum' scenario refl ects fi xed remuneration, plus full 
payout of all incentives.
Shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors
The Committee sets shareholding guidelines for Executive 
Directors. The current guideline is to build and maintain, over 
time, a personal (and/or spousal) holding of shares in the 
Company equivalent in value to at least twice the Executive 
Director's annual base salary (three times for the CEO). The 
guidelines also state that an Executive Director is expected to 
retain at least half of any shares acquired on the exercise of a 
share award that remain after the sale of suffi cient shares to 
cover tax and national insurance triggered by the exercise (and 
associated dealing costs) until the guideline level is achieved 
and thereafter maintained. The Executive Directors' compliance 
with these guidelines is shown in the table on page 110.

The latest service contracts are available for inspection at the 
Company's registered offi ce and will also be available at the 
Company's Annual General Meeting.
The Company's policy is that Executive Directors' service 
contracts should be capable of being terminated by the 
Company on not more than 12 months' notice. The Executive 
Directors' service contracts entitle the Company to terminate 
their employment without notice by making a payment of salary 
and benefi ts in lieu of notice. In these circumstances, for new 
contracts (including for John Davies) the Company can choose 
to make the payment in lieu by monthly instalments and 
mitigation applies such that the Committee may decide to 
reduce or discontinue further instalments. For existing contracts 
(for Executive Directors other than for John Davies) such a 
payment would be by way of a lump sum payment on 
termination. If the Company terminates an Executive Director's 
service contract it will have regard to all the circumstances 
(including the scope for mitigation) and the Company's interests 
in determining the amount of compensation, if any, payable to 
him in connection with that termination.
The contracts for Peter Rogers and Bill Tame (but not for Archie 
Bethel, Kevin Thomas and John Davies) contain provisions which 
provide that within 90 days of the occurrence of a change of 
control of the Company, each may terminate his employment 
forthwith. If he exercises this right, he is entitled, for a 12-month 
period, to be paid (on a monthly basis) his base salary plus 40% 
(compared to a maximum entitlement under the annual bonus 
scheme of 150%) in lieu of bonus and all other contractual 
entitlements. From this payment there is to be deducted any 
amount that the Executive Director receives by way of income, 
if it exceeds 10% of his Babcock salary, from other sources that 
he would not have been able to earn had he continued in 
employment with the Company. 
The contracts for Peter Rogers and Bill Tame (but not for Kevin 
Thomas, Archie Bethel and John Davies) also provide that if the 
Company terminates their appointment within 12 months of 
a change of control, they would be entitled to a termination 
payment equal to 100% of annual salary (plus 40% in lieu 
of bonus and all other benefi ts), subject to any additional 
entitlement as outlined below.
In addition to the contractual provisions regarding payment 
on termination set out above, the Company's incentive plans 
contain provisions for termination of employment, where 
the Committee has the discretion to determine the level of 
award vesting. Babcock International Group PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2014

1.  An individual would generally be considered a  good leaver' if they leave the Group's employment by reason of injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy or retirement 
(in each case evidenced to the Committee's satisfaction). The treatment of share awards held by Directors who leave on other grounds is entirely at the discretion 
of the Committee and in deciding whether (and the extent to which) it would be appropriate to exercise that discretion the Committee will have regard to all 
the circumstances.
2. Treatment of bonus on a change of control for Peter Rogers and Bill Tame is also the subject of the provisions outlined on page 95 and above.
The Committee has discretion to allow awards held by leavers 
to vest immediately and/or in full or for a  good leaver' or on 
a change of control at a higher proportion than strict time-
apportionment if it considers this to be appropriate. In deciding 
how to exercise its discretion the Committee will take account 
of all the circumstances arising including, in the case of a 
leaver, the reasons for and circumstances of the termination of 
employment, the leaver's length of service, level of responsibility 
and business impact, individual performance during their tenure, 
exceptional contribution to the business and the extent to which 
that contribution is expected to still have an impact during 
the remainder of the applicable performance period. The 
Committee may also make any favourable exercise of its 
discretion subject to conditions.
External appointments of Executive Directors
The Executive Directors may accept external appointments 
with the prior approval of the Chairman, provided that such 
appointments do not prejudice the individual's ability to fulfi l 
their duties at the Group. Any fees for outside appointments 
are retained by the Director.

The latest written terms of appointment are available for 
inspection at the Company's registered offi ce and at the 
Company's Annual General Meeting. The expected time 
commitment of Non-Executive Directors is set out in their 
current written terms of appointment.
The Group's Non-Executive Directors serve under letters of 
appointment as detailed in the table above, normally for no 
more than three year terms at a time; however, in all cases 
appointments are terminable at will at any time by the Company 
or the Director. All Non-Executive Directors are subject to annual 
re-election by the Company in general meeting in line with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code.
Details of the Non-Executive Directors' terms of appointment 
are shown in the table. The appointment and re-appointment 
and the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors are matters 
reserved for the Nominations Committee and Executive 
Directors, respectively.
The Non-Executive Directors' fees have been set at a level to 
refl ect the amount of time and level of involvement required in 
order to carry out their duties as members of the Board and its 
Committees. The Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to 
participate in the Company's performance-related incentive 
plans and do not receive any pension contributions. Governance

Details of the policy on fees paid to our Non-Executive Directors are set out in the table below:
Function Operation Opportunity Performance measures
To attract and retain high 
calibre Non-Executive 
Directors with commercial 
and other experience 
relevant to the Company
Fee levels are reviewed against 
market practice from time to 
time (by the Chairman and the 
Executive Directors in the case of 
Non-Executive Director fees and 
by the Remuneration Committee 
in respect of fees payable to the 
Chairman), with any adjustments 
normally being made on 1 April 
in the review year
Additional fees are payable for 
acting as Chairman of the Audit 
and Risk, and Remuneration 
Committees
Fee levels are reviewed by 
reference to FTSE listed 
companies of similar size and 
complexity. Time commitment, 
level of involvement required 
and responsibility are taken 
into account when reviewing 
fee levels
Fees for the year ending 
31 March 2014 and those for the 
year ending 31 March 2015 are 
set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration on page 109.
Non-Executive Director fee 
increases are applied in line 
with the outcome of the 
periodic fee review
Any increases to the Non-
Executive Director fee will 
typically be in line with general 
movements in market levels of 
Non-Executive Director fees
In the event that there is a 
material misalignment with 
the market or a change in the 
complexity, responsibility or time 
commitment required to fulfi l a 
Non-Executive Director role, the 
Board has discretion to make an 
appropriate adjustment to the 
fee level

Consideration of employee views
When reviewing Executive Director pay the Committee is aware 
of the proposals for review of remuneration of all employees. 
The Committee receives regular updates on salary increases, 
bonus and share awards made to employees throughout the 
Group. These matters are considered when conducting the 
annual review of executive remuneration. The Company seeks 
to promote and maintain good relationships with employee 
representative bodies as part of its employee engagement 
strategy and consults on matters affecting employees and 
business performance as required in each case by law and 
regulation in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. 
The Company now formally presents a summary of its policy 
for remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors to the 
Babcock Employee Forum, which is attended by representatives 
from across the UK business operations, and will consider any 
feedback from that Forum.
Consideration of shareholder views
When determining remuneration, the Committee takes into 
account views of leading shareholders and best practice 
guidelines issued by institutional shareholder bodies. The 
Committee is always open to feedback from shareholders 
on remuneration policy and arrangements, and commits 
to undergoing consultation with leading shareholders in 
advance of any signifi cant changes to remuneration policy. 
The Committee will continue to monitor trends and 
developments in corporate governance and market practice 
to ensure the structure of the executive remuneration 
remains appropriate.

Advisers
Kepler Associates (Kepler) was appointed by the Committee in 
late 2008, following a selection process including interviewing 
a number of candidate fi rms, to provide it with independent 
analysis, information and advice on all aspects of executive 
remuneration and market practice, within the context of the 
objectives and policy set by the Committee. Kepler reports 
directly to the Committee Chairman. A representative from 
Kepler typically attends Committee meetings. Kepler provides 
no other services to the Company. Kepler is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and is a signatory to the 
Code of Conduct for consultants to Remuneration Committees 
of UK listed companies, details of which can be found at 
www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. Kepler adheres to 
this Code of Conduct. The fees paid to Kepler in respect of work 
carried out in the year under review totalled  125,988 on the 
basis of time and materials, excluding expenses and VAT.
The Committee periodically considers whether Kepler remains 
independent of the Company and that the advice provided is 
impartial and objective. The Committee is satisfi ed that the 
advice provided by Kepler is independent.

The Committee engaged with leading shareholders before the 
AGM in 2013 on a number of matters and proposed changes to 
the remuneration arrangements. Feedback from a minority of 
shareholders consulted stated a preference for  simplicity' with 
regard to incentive structures. Internally, we work to ensure that 
incentive plans are well communicated to, and well understood 
by, participants. We believe the plans are structured to align the 
interests of shareholders and management, and that the 
addition of matching awards under the DBMP has been 
crucial in rewarding and motivating our management team.
The Committee will continue to engage with its major 
shareholders to facilitate a better understanding of the 
Company, the environment in which it operates and how this 
translates into the Group's executive remuneration policy.

incurred at the request of the Company, accommodation benefi ts, car and fuel benefi ts and costs in connection with accommodation.
3.  Pension: for Peter Rogers, Bill Tame, Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas, value of the cash supplement; for John Davies (i) 20 times the increase in his accrued benefi t over 
the year, less Directors' contributions plus (ii) the value of the cash supplement.
4.  Annual bonus (cash or voluntarily deferred bonus): this is the part of total annual bonus earned for performance during the year (see page 102) that is not required to 
be mandatorily deferred into a basic award of shares under the DBMP) (see page 103) and that is to be satisfi ed in cash and/or, if the Director has so elected, by the 
making of a voluntary deferral award of shares under the DBMP .
5.  DBMP deferred annual bonus: this is the mandatorily deferred element of the annual bonus earned for performance during the year, which will vest after three years.
6.  DBMP (matching awards): no DBMP awards vested on performance to (i) 31 March 2014 or (ii) 31 March 2013.
7.  PSP: the market value of awards that vest on performance to (i) 31 March 2014: based on vesting as to 94.7% of the total award to Peter Rogers and 93.0% of the 
awards to other Executive Directors and an average share price in the 3 months to 31 March 2014 of 1,233p and (ii) 31 March 2013: based on vesting as to 58.8% 
of the total award to Peter Rogers and 78.4% of the awards to other Executive Directors and a vest date share price on 13 July 2013 of 1,173p. Note: the difference 
for 2012/13 PSP fi gures versus that disclosed in last year's Annual Report on Remuneration refl ects truing up for the actual share price on vesting.
8.  Dividends: the total value of dividends accruing on long-term incentive awards (other than on mandatory deferral of bonus awards under the DBP) vesting on 
performance to (i) 31 March 2014 and (ii) 31 March 2013, payable in cash on exercise of the award.

Base salary
Executive Directors' base salaries and benefi ts are reviewed each 
year with any changes usually taking effect from 1 April. The 
Committee determined that base salaries and benefi ts for 
2014/15 for Executive Directors should be increased in line 
with those for the wider Group. The Committee was informed by 
the Executive Directors that exceptionally they would not be 
drawing the increase granted for 2014/15 in order to 
demonstrate their understanding of the fi nancial austerity still 
affecting the UK Government as the Company's principal 
customer. The Committee welcomed that one-year restraint, 
and agreed that the increase it had made for 2014/15 (2.5%) 
would be included in the baseline for their next review in 2015.

Internal relativity
As noted above, when reviewing Executive Directors' 
remuneration, the Committee takes note of proposals for pay in 
the wider Group. Each business within the Group determines its 
own pay structures and remuneration in light of its own position 
and the employment market in which it operates. The overall 
average salary increases for employees generally for the year 
to 31 March 2015 is expected to be in the order of 2.5% (with 
individual increases signifi cantly above this amount in some 
cases) dependent on business and personal performance and 
local market conditions.
Pensions
The Executive Directors, other than John Davies, did not 
participate in a Group pension scheme or otherwise receive 
pension benefi ts from the Group for service during the year to 
31 March 2014. These Executive Directors received a cash 
supplement equal to 25% of their base salary in lieu of pension 
benefi ts. There are no additional early retirement benefi ts.
John Davies is a member of the Babcock International Group 
Pension Scheme. During the year to 31 March 2014, he 
received a cash supplement equal to  36k in lieu of pension 
benefi ts on that part of his base salary as exceeded the 
applicable scheme earnings cap. 
Supplements paid in lieu of pension do not count for pension, 
share award or bonus purposes.
Babcock International Group Pension Scheme (the 
Scheme) (audited)
Bill Tame was a member of the senior executive tier of the 
Scheme until 30 September 2011. Archie Bethel and Kevin 
Thomas were members of the executive tier of the Scheme 
until 31 March 2012. All three Directors are no longer active 
members of the Scheme. Whilst still members of the Scheme, 
Bill Tame accrued benefi ts at the rate of one-thirtieth, and for 
Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas at the rate of one-forty-fi fth, 
of pensionable salary for each year of service.
John Davies is a member of the VT Upper Section Ex-Short 
Brothers section of the Scheme. He accrues benefi ts on earnings 
up to the scheme earnings cap (currently  141,000) at the rate 
of one-sixtieth of pensionable salary for each year of service.
Pension entitlements under the Scheme (defi ned benefi t) for the 
year to 31 March 2014 are set out in the following table:

Note: The fi gures in the above table make no allowance for the cost of death 
in service benefi ts under the Scheme, or for any benefi ts in respect of earnings 
in excess of the earnings cap. In calculating the above fi gures no account

Annual Bonus Scheme 
2013/14 Annual bonus (audited)
For our Executive Directors' annual bonus schemes in 2013/14, as in previous years, a mix of fi nancial and non-fi nancial measures 
was used. The non-fi nancial measures were principally based on the key themes that are of central importance to the continued 
success of the Company, including: reputation protection; growth; security; employee engagement and talent development; and 
IT systems improvement. Maintaining a satisfactory health and safety and environmental performance is always an overriding bonus 
objective. The fi nancial measures were focused on delivery of budget profi tability, cash management and growth in earnings. 
Objectives for the 2013/14 bonus were set by the Committee at the beginning of the year.
The table below sets out the annual bonus schemes in place for the Executive Directors and the outturn under them in 2013/14.

3.  The Remuneration Committee considers that the divisional budgets remain commercially sensitive given the strategic nature of some of our customers or their activities 
and they would also be of assistance to competitors, and will not be published.
4.  Non-fi nancial objectives were set around the following priority strategic and risk management themes: Reputation (with customers and investors, including 
specifi ed improved strategic and customer engagement objectives, anti-bribery and corruption training and review of policies and procedures); Growth (relating 
to strategy planning and development, progress against existing strategic plans particularly for territories outside the UK, specifi c bidding targets and objectives, 
win rates, development and leveraging of identifi ed strategic partnerships, organisational and management changes to support growth and strategic objectives); 
Employees (developing or progressing employee engagement, communications and cultural initiatives, for example in connection with diversity; talent identifi cation, 
development and succession planning initiatives and programmes, developing graduate and apprentice strategies and relationships with universities); Process 
improvements (for example in IT , IT strategy, management information systems, cyber-security and information assurance objectives). The actual objectives set 
are considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive relating as they do to customer relationships, specifi c bids, specifi c strategic steps or objectives, security 
measures and personnel issues or they are effectively discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report.
2014/15 Annual bonus
For our annual bonus schemes for 2014/15 we are continuing 
to use the structure adopted in 2013/14 as set out in the table 
above. Bonuses will be based on the same measures and 
weightings as those used in 2013/14. The Committee intends 
to disclose fi nancial performance targets and personal 
objectives retrospectively in next year's Annual Report on 
Remuneration, subject to these no longer being considered 
by the Board to be commercially sensitive. Governance

The weighting of the elements of bonus is kept under review 
and, in particular, the weighting for non-fi nancial objectives for 
the annual bonus scheme for 2015/16 and future years is a 
matter the Committee will be considering during the current 
fi nancial year.
Annual bonus deferral into shares (audited)
To ensure that a substantial part of the Director's annual bonus 
is exposed to the longer term impact of decision-making and to 
further align their interests with shareholders, 40% of any annual 
bonus earned by Executive Directors (and other senior 
executives) must be deferred into Babcock shares (by means of 
an award of nil-cost options). Under the Deferred Bonus Plan 
(applicable to deferred bonus awards made to Directors before 
2012) the deferral period was two years. From 2012 deferred 
awards have been made to Directors under the Deferred Bonus 
Matching Plan (DBMP) under which the deferral period is three 
years. In addition to mandatory deferral of 40% of bonus the 
DBMP allows for Directors to be invited to make a voluntary 
additional investment (including by way of accepting deferral 
of extra amounts of bonus) of an amount equal to up to 40% 
of salary. Both mandatorily deferred and voluntary investments 
are eligible for matching share awards of up to a 2 for 1 match. 
The Committee granted performance-related matching awards 
under the DBMP to Directors on the amount of bonus for 
2012/13 mandatorily or voluntarily deferred into share awards 
under that scheme and will be doing the same in respect of 
bonus mandatorily or voluntarily deferred into share awards for 
2013/14. The performance conditions relating to matching 
awards made in 2013 and those proposed for matching awards 
to be made in 2014 are discussed on pages 104 and 105. 
Bonuses mandatorily deferred into shares in 2010 and 2011 
did not have any associated matching share awards. Deferred 
annual bonus awards are subject to potential forfeiture if the 
holder leaves before the awards vest (other than by reason of 
death, disability, redundancy, retirement or the company or 
business in which they are employed ceasing to be part of 
the Group).

Directors. Awards were made over shares having a total value on 
grant equal to 200% of basic salary for Peter Rogers and 150%

targets attached to those awards - split equally between TSR 
performance relative to the peer group and real EPS growth

Threshold vesting (16.7% of this element) for the EPS element 
was set at real growth of 4% per annum and maximum vesting 
at real growth of 11% per annum. We believe that real growth 
of 11% would represent exceptional performance. For the 
comparative TSR element, threshold vesting (16.7% of this 
element) would be for performance in line with the median of 
the FTSE 350 (excluding investment trusts and fi nancial services 
companies) and maximum vesting would be for 9% p.a. 
outperformance of the median, representing upper quartile 
performance.

The DBMP allows the Committee to make matching share 
awards of up to two times the deferred bonus shares (40% 
of bonus) and any additional shares or extra bonus deferral 
self-invested under the scheme by the Director (of an amount 
equal to up to 40% of salary). The matching share award is 
performance-related and only vests to the extent that the 
performance criteria are met in respect of the three-year 
performance period. For the 2013 cycle, the performance 
period runs from 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2016, the same as 
for PSP awards made in 2013. The performance targets attached 
to those awards - split equally between TSR performance

The target for maximum vesting is ROCE of 23.5% and for threshold vesting it is 21.5%. The maximum match is 2 for 1 on any shares 
held under the plan; 0.25 matching shares would be released for each such share at threshold vesting. Therefore for each measure, 
threshold vesting would be a (0.25/3) for 1 match (4.2% of maximum) and maximum vesting would be a (2/3) for 1 match (33% 
of maximum).

2011 PSP awards vesting (audited)
Awards granted in 2011 under the PSP were subject to 3-year 
TSR and EPS targets outlined on page 106. 3-year TSR to 
31 March 2014 was 15% p.a. above median TSR for the 
FTSE 350 (excluding investment trusts and fi nancial services). 
Babcock's 3-year adjusted basic underlying EPS growth to 
31 March 2014 was 11.1% p.a. in excess of RPI (historical 
EPS numbers were restated to ensure they were on the same 
accounting basis). Accordingly, 2011 PSP awards are expected 
to vest in June 2014 as to 94.7% for Peter Rogers and 93.0% 
for other Executive Directors.

PSP and DBMP awards for 2014/15
The Committee intends to grant awards under the PSP and 
DBMP with the same maximum opportunities and performance 
measures as in 2013. EPS targets for the 2014 PSP and DBMP 
awards will vest from RPI +4% p.a. to RPI +11% p.a. over three 
years; TSR targets for the 2014 PSP and DBMP awards will vest 
between median and median +9% relative to the peer group; 
ROCE targets for the DBMP, however, will be set later in the year.
As mentioned in the circular issued by the Company on 
27 March 2014 relating to the acquisition of the Avincis Group, 
the acquisition is only expected to achieve a return on invested 
capital in excess of the Company's current cost of capital from 
the second full fi nancial year following the acquisition. However, 
this level of return, while value-creating for the business as a 
whole, is below Babcock's current ROCE. The Committee 
believes it is important to ensure that the performance of 
Babcock and the acquired business is taken into account for 
2014 DBMP awards, and as such, the relevant ROCE targets 
will be reviewed during the year and set to ensure they are 
commensurate with those set in previous years. The Committee 
will communicate the targets in next year's report.
Sourcing of shares
Shares needed to satisfy share awards for Directors are either 
fresh issue shares issued to the Group's employee share trusts 
to meet share awards or shares purchased in the market by 
the trusts using funds advanced by the Company. The source 
selection is fi nalised on or before vesting, the choice being 
based on what the Board considers to be in the best interests 
of the Company at the time, and what is permissible within 
available headroom and dilution limits. Babcock International Group PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2014

If comparative TSR performance exceeded median TSR performance for the peer group taken as a whole 
by more than 9% per annum further shares vest, with full vesting of this additional award for more than 
12.5% per annum. This will affect the relative proportion of the award vesting in his case. For 2010, none 
of the additional award vested. The 2011 additional award is expected to vest in full.
TSR comparator group For the TSR element the peer group is the FTSE 350 (excluding investment trusts and fi nancial services). 
This group was chosen after careful review due to the fact that Babcock's closest peers straddle multiple 
sectors, not just support services, and the broader group makes the calibration more robust.
Other information The awards are not subject to re-testing. The TSR element will vest only to the extent the Committee is 
satisfi ed that the recorded TSR is a genuine refl ection of the underlying performance of the Company over 
the performance period.
EPS is adjusted to exclude acquired intangible amortisation, but, unless the Committee decides otherwise 
in respect of any item, is after exceptional items. Real EPS growth is that in excess of the change in the 
retail prices index.
The awards carry the right to receive on vesting a payment equal to the value of any dividends paid in the 
period between grant and vesting but this right applies only to the shares that actually vest under the 
award. Exercise periods commence not less than three years from actual or nominal award grant date.
CSOP and PSP awards are linked so that in aggregate the holder cannot receive more gross value from 
them than a standalone PSP award of shares equal to the relevant award multiple of the Director's 
base salary. Governance

Performance period Not applicable: these awards represent amounts of annual bonus mandatorily (DBP) and/or mandatorily 
and voluntarily (DBMP) deferred into awards. Awards under the DBP vest and become exercisable two 
years, those under the DBMP three years, after the date of grant. The DBP awards made in 2011 vested 
in July 2013.
Other information Deferred annual bonus awards are subject to potential forfeiture if the holder leaves before the awards 
vest (other than by reason of death, disability, redundancy, retirement or the company or business in 
which they are employed ceasing to be part of the Group).
The number of shares into which bonus has been mandatorily deferred may be reduced by the Committee 
if the accounts by reference to which the bonus was calculated have to be materially corrected or if, in 
the opinion of the Committee, there is evidence that performance against performance conditions in the 
bonus year or the impact of that performance on the Group in respect of future fi nancial years was or will 
be materially worse than was believed to be the case at the time of the original assessment.
The shares carry the right to dividends in the period of deferral, but payable only when the shares 
are released.

EBIT of JVs, as a percentage of Average Capital Employed where Capital Employed is calculated as Total 
Shareholders' Equity plus Net Debt (or minus Net Funds), as stated in the Company's consolidated audited 
accounts for the relevant Financial Year; and Average Capital Employed will be calculated as the average 
of the opening and closing value of Capital Employed for each year of the Performance Period.

Remuneration report continued
Linkage of remuneration to strategic objectives, risk management and its alignment with shareholder interests
The Committee links the remuneration of executives to the long-term interests of shareholders and key strategic and 
risk management objectives by the performance criteria it uses in the annual bonus and long-term incentive schemes. 
Examples include the following:
Strategic Objective (SO)/Risk (R) Annual bonus scheme metric Long-term incentive metric
SO/R: Delivering superior and sustainable 
value for our shareholders, whilst balancing 
risk and reward.
Financial measures focused on annual 
delivery of sustainable earnings and/or 
profi ts with stretch targets, whilst 
maintaining strict control of cash.
Incentivising delivery of top quartile 
shareholder returns and earnings growth 
over the longer term. 
Long-term measures and deferral of 
signifi cant part of annual bonus to guard 
against short-term steps being taken to 
maximise annual rewards at the expense 
of future performance.
SO: Growth. Setting challenging budgets and stretch 
targets, as well as non-fi nancial measures 
specifi cally aimed at:
 - laying the foundations for sustainable 
growth in specifi c geographical and 
existing and new business markets;
 - winning key bids and re-bids;
 - fostering strategically important 
partnering arrangements.
SO: Developing and maintaining leading 
market positions in the UK and selected 
overseas markets.
Specifi c non-fi nancial objectives for:
 - progressing plans for entry into or 
expansion in targeted domestic and 
overseas markets;
 - securing key business development 
milestones.
SO: Building and maintaining customer-
focused, long-term relationships with 
strategically important customers.
R: Loss of business reputation, poor 
contract performance.
Objectives linked to:
 - customer satisfaction;
 - continuing improvement of 
management processes;
 - meeting and planning for existing and 
future customer expectations on 
capability and compliance, for example, 
in the fi eld of security and information 
assurance.
SO/R: Ensuring the Group will continue 
to retain and attract the suitably qualifi ed 
and experienced people it needs to 
deliver its growth and strategic plans, 
maintain and develop its technical and 
management expertise.
Non-fi nancial objectives linked to talent 
development and succession planning, 
and fostering employee engagement. 
Retentive nature of the requirement for 
deferral into shares of 40% of annual 
bonuses earned by senior executives.
Retentive nature of the long-term schemes.
SO/R: Maintenance of an excellent health, 
safety and environmental record.
Overriding health, safety and

Performance graphs 
The following graph shows the TSR (Total Shareholder Return) for the Company compared to the FTSE100 Index and FTSE350 
Support Services Index, assuming  100 was invested on 31 March 2009 (investment in the Company was worth  346 on 31 March 
2014). The Board considers that these indices currently represent the most appropriate of the published indices for these purposes 
as it provides a view of performance against the broad equity market and sector index of which the Company is a constituent.

1.  L-TIP = 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan; PSP = 2009 Performance Share Plan; CSOP = 2009 Company Share Option Plan; DBP = 2009 Deferred Bonus Plan. DBMP = 
2012 Deferred Bonus Matching Plan. Further details about these plans and, where applicable, performance conditions attaching to the awards listed are to be found 
on pages 103 to 107.
2.  The PSP , DBP , DBMP and L-TIP awards are structured as nil priced options. DBP awards and DBMP (basic awards represent the amount of the annual bonus mandatorily 
deferred and DBMP voluntary deferral awards represent the amount voluntarily deferred by the Director), in each case converted into shares at their value at the 
award date. 
3. Subject to the rules of the scheme concerned, including as to meeting performance targets for PSP , LTIP , CSOP and DBMP Matching Awards. 
4.  Where this date is less than ten years from the date of award, the Committee may extend the expiry date on one or more occasions, but not beyond the tenth 
anniversary of the award. 
5.  The vesting of the CSOP award is subject to performance measures that are identical to those for the PSP award granted on the same date. When a CSOP award is 
granted at the same time as a PSP award, the PSP award has two parts. The CSOP and PSP awards are linked so that the maximum aggregate number of shares that 
can be acquired on exercise of the two awards is limited to that number of shares that had a market value on the date of the awards (and after deducting any exercise 
price payable on exercise of the CSOP award) equal to the relevant grant multiple of the Director's base salary at the date of the awards (the  Limit'). This is achieved 
making the level of vesting of Part B of the PSP Award accord to the level of vesting of the linked CSOP award but the actual number of vested Part B award shares that 
can be exercised is then limited according to the exercise price on the day of exercise such that the total value of Part B PSP award shares so exercisable does not then 
exceed the exercise price payable on exercise of the vested CSOP award. If there is less than full vesting, it is possible for the Director to choose to exercise the CSOP to 
its fullest extent within the Limit and then to exercise the PSP award to the extent of any balance left within the Limit.
5A. The actual number of shares capable of being exercised under Part B of the PSP award can only be determined on the exercise date as explained in note 5 above.
6. Awards shown in the table for John Davies for 2010, 2011, and 2012 were made prior to his appointment as a Director, which took effect on 1 January 2013.
7.  Outstanding awards will be adjusted to refl ect the rights issue which completed during May 2014 using a standard adjustment factor of 1.13417. Any reference 
price, including the exercise prices shown will also be adjusted. Babcock International Group PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2014
