 Linklaters for the provision of legal advice
and services. Linklaters provided other legal
services to the company in 2003; and
 New Bridge Street Consultants LLP
2
for the
provision and interpretation of information
on long-term incentive policy within major
global companies.
New Bridge Street Consultants were
appointed directly by the Committee and
Linklaters were appointed by the company at
the request of the Committee. 
Remuneration policy
The Committee's executive remuneration
policy continues to be to set basic salaries at
median competitive levels whilst seeking to
reward upper quartile performance with
potential upper quartile remuneration. The
Committee intends to continue with the
executive remuneration policy as detailed in
this report in 2004 and subsequent years,
subject to ongoing review as appropriate, and
to make amendments to remuneration, as
appropriate, to maintain this position. 
The long-standing policy of allowing executive
directors to hold external non-BAE Systems
related non-executive directorships with the
prior approval of the Committee will continue.
The Committee considers that external
directorships provide the company's senior
executives with valuable experience. The
director may retain any fees received from
such appointments. Such fees retained by
the full-time executive directors in 2003 were
as follows: Michael Lester  32,845; George
Rose  53,750; and Mike Turner  27,000.
Review of long-term incentive arrangements
As part of its formulation of future policy, in
2003 the Committee undertook a detailed
review of the competitiveness of the existing
long-term incentive arrangements and recent
developments in remuneration practice. To
assist in the review the Committee appointed
New Bridge Street Consultants.
In line with company policy, extensive
consultation took place with the company's
principal shareholders (based both in the UK
and overseas) as well as institutional investor
bodies. Taking on board views expressed
during the consultation process, a number of
modifications were made to the application of
the Executive Share Option Plan and the
Performance Share Plan. 
The review concluded that the company
should operate both plans for executive
directors within the following framework,
ensuring that the level of awards are in line
with similar plans operated by other 
FTSE 100 companies:
 options granted under the Executive Share
Option Plan to be set at a maximum of
1.5 x salary (under the existing scheme
rules the maximum grant is 3 x salary); 
 awards under the Performance Share Plan
to be set at 1 x salary. Having taken market
data into account, the Committee decided
to set the median level of vesting for the
2003 and 2004 awards at 25%. Thus, one
quarter of the shares under award will be
released if the company's total shareholder
return (TSR) performance (share price
growth plus dividends) over a three-year
performance period is in the top 50% of the
TSR comparator group, with 100% of the
shares under award being released if the
TSR is in the top 20%. Intermediate
positions will be calculated on a straight
line pro-rata basis;
 recognising the specific and international
nature of the company's business activities,
the TSR comparator group for the
Performance Share Plan has been changed
from the FTSE 100 Index constituents to a
list of 18 other major defence and
aerospace companies operating in the
international arena as a more appropriate
measure of TSR performance. The
comparator group is as follows:
Boeing Cobham
Dassault Aviation EADS
Embraer PN Finmeccanica
General Dynamics GKN
Goodrich Honeywell International
Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman
Raytheon Rockwell Automation
Rolls-Royce Smiths Group
Thales United Technologies
The Remuneration Committee
The Board has delegated to the
Remuneration Committee responsibility for
remuneration policy and specific packages for
the executive directors. Until 29 April 2003
remuneration matters were dealt with by the
Nominations and Compensation Committee
which also had responsibility for nominating
suitable candidates to the Board. Its
composition comprised Sir Robin Biggam
(chairman), Professor Sue Birley, Keith Brown,
Lord Hesketh and, when it acted in the
capacity of nominating individuals to the
Board, Sir Richard Evans. On 29 April 2003
the Nominations and Compensation
Committee was split into separate
Remuneration and Nominations Committees.
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by
Professor Sue Birley and its other members
are Lord Hesketh
1
, Sir Peter Mason and
Dr Ulrich Cartellieri, all of whom are 
non-executive directors and were considered
to be independent throughout 2003. The
company's chairman and chief executive
attend committee meetings by invitation only.
They do not attend where their individual
remuneration is discussed and no director is
involved in deciding his own remuneration.
In 2003 the Nominations and Compensation
Committee met twice up to 28 April 2003 to
consider remuneration issues and, from
29 April 2003 until the end of the year, the
Remuneration Committee met four times.
Details of attendance at these meetings are
provided in the corporate governance report
on page 33. Within this remuneration report
references to  the Committee' relate to both
the Remuneration Committee as well as the
Nominations and Compensation Committee
where it dealt with remuneration-related
matters. During the year the Committee
reviewed its terms of reference to align them
with best practice under the revised
Combined Code.
During 2003, Sir Richard Evans and Mike
Turner, in their respective capacities as
chairman and chief executive, provided advice
that was of material assistance to the
Committee. The Committee also received
material assistance and advice on
remuneration policy and recruitment from the
company's group human resources director,
Alastair Imrie. In addition, the Committee
received advice and/or services that were of
material assistance from the following:

Committee on 25 February 2004

New Bridge Street Consultants LLP is a leading independent
adviser on executive remuneration. It has provided no other
material advice to the Committee or the company during
the year
  The Committee will continue with the use of
this industry comparator group for 2004
and beyond, although the specific
composition of the industry comparator
group will be reviewed on an annual basis;
and
 in addition to the TSR test outlined above,
shares in the Performance Share Plan will
only be released after three years if the
Committee is satisfied that there has been
a sustained improvement in underlying
financial performance.
Shareholders' views of the appropriateness of
the re-testing of performance under the
Executive Share Option Plan, where the
performance conditions have not been met
over the original three-year period, have
evolved since the plan was approved by
shareholders in 2001. The Committee is
aware of these views and has considered
whether the policy of allowing two re-testing
opportunities for future grants of options
should continue to be provided (there are no
re-tests within the Performance Share Plan).
The conclusion of the review was that for
grants made in 2004, one re-test only will be
allowed at the end of year five against the full
period since grant. A further review of the
policy relating to re-tests will take place prior
to any grant of options in 2005. 
The above represents ongoing policy and the
Committee will continue to consult on
changes with principal shareholders.
Elements of remuneration
Remuneration of executive directors consists
typically of basic salary, a bonus based on
annual performance, participation in
employee share schemes and retirement
benefits. The following provides more details
of these benefits. 
Basic salary and benefits
Executive directors' salaries are reviewed
each year by the Committee and adjusted to
reflect performance and the competitiveness
of salaries relative to the market. Information
on the market for comparable management
positions is obtained from independent
sources and is provided to the Committee so
that it can form a view as to where to
position basic salaries and benefits relative
to comparable companies. All reviews of
salaries and benefits for executive directors
are made having taken full account of the
performance of the group as a whole and the
pay and conditions of group employees in
particular. It continues to be the company's
aim to create an environment with policies
which fairly reward individual performance
against business objectives; this applies
equally to all employees.
The Committee has reviewed regularly the
split between basic salary and the
performance related elements of
remuneration in order to incentivise properly
executive directors, and believes that a
significant proportion of remuneration should
be based on schemes that encourage them
to perform at the highest level. Through the
use of share-based incentive schemes, the
Committee seeks to align the interests of
executive directors with those of other
shareholders. It is the company's policy to set
basic salaries at median levels of a
comparable group of companies and to
incentivise and reward exceptional executive
performance through the bonus schemes and
share-based incentives. Through this
arrangement, it is possible for those
individuals who contribute to sustained high
levels of company performance to receive at
least a similar level of reward from variable
compensation to that received from fixed
compensation. At median performance,
variable remuneration represents
approximately 50% of the remuneration
package; at upper quartile performance
variable remuneration represents significantly
more than this. 
Annual bonus scheme
The executive directors (with the exception of
Sir Richard Evans) and other senior
executives participate in a bonus scheme
that rewards those individuals if targets
agreed by the Committee for earnings per
share (EPS), profit before interest and tax
(PBIT), cash performance and certain 
non-financial targets are met. The EPS figure
used for the bonus scheme (and for the
Executive Share Option Plan) is based on
basic EPS excluding goodwill amortisation
and impairment and exceptional items and
may be adjusted if necessary to ensure that
the figures for individual years are broadly
comparable. In determining the performance
measures for the annual bonus scheme, the
Committee took the view that our major
investors believed EPS and cash targets (and,
where appropriate, PBIT) to be key indicators
of long-term financial performance and value
creation. These measures will be reviewed
each year to determine whether they are still
appropriate.
As a result of its annual review of the
performance related aspects of remuneration,
which included consideration of market
comparator information, for 2004 the
Committee determined that the policy for
maximum bonus entitlement will be 100% of
basic salary. It was considered appropriate to
take account of different US remuneration
practices in determining the maximum bonus
entitlement for Mark Ronald which in 2004
will be 150% of his basic salary. For 2004,
the bonus performance metrics for the chief
executive, group finance director and group
legal director are based on a mix of 
group-related EPS and cash targets, and 
non-financial targets. The bonus performance
metrics for the three chief operating officers
are based on a mix of group-related EPS and
cash targets, PBIT and cash targets relating
to their discrete areas of operational
responsibility, and non-financial targets. For
each element of the bonus there is a base
target and a stretch target; intermediate
payments are payable for performance
between these two targets. 
Share option schemes and long-term
incentive schemes
As stated above, during 2003 a detailed
review and consultation process with principal
shareholders and institutional investor bodies
was undertaken in respect of long-term
incentive arrangements and appropriate
modifications made to their operation.
Performance conditions for grants of options
or awards in 2004, under the Executive Share
Option Plan and the Performance Share Plan,
are detailed below. Performance conditions
for earlier option grants and awards are
shown as notes to table C.
Executive Share Option Plan
Options granted under the BAE Systems
Executive Share Option Plan are normally
exercisable between the third and tenth
anniversary of their grant. Options may only
be exercised during this period as follows:
 33.33% of each option grant is exercisable
if the company achieves on average real
EPS growth per annum of 3% but less than
4% over the three-year performance period;
 66.67% of each option grant is exercisable
if the company achieves on average real
EPS growth per annum of 4% but less than
5% over the three-year performance period;
 100% of each option grant is exercisable if
the company achieves on average real EPS
growth per annum of 5% or more over the
three-year performance period.
BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 37 company shares the cash bonuses that they
have earned under the bonus scheme, which
was itself based on performance criteria. Our
personal shareholding policy (see below)
reinforces this philosophy.
There were no awards made under the
Restricted Share Plan in 2003, however, the
Committee intends to operate this plan in
2004 and future years.
SAYE Share Option Scheme
The executive directors (with the exception of
Mark Ronald) are entitled to participate in the
company's Save-As-You-Earn Share Option
Scheme. Statutory provisions do not allow
options granted under these schemes to be
subject to any performance conditions.
Dilution of share capital
The Committee has agreed that the maximum
number of options that shall be granted in
any one year, which are to be satisfied by new
issue shares, will not exceed 1% of the
company's issued share capital.
Personal shareholding policy
The Committee has agreed a policy whereby
all executive directors are required to
establish and maintain a minimum personal
shareholding equal to 200% of salary. As a
minimum a holding equal to 100% of salary
must be achieved as quickly as possible
using shares vesting or options exercised
through the executive share option schemes
or long-term incentive schemes, by using 50%
of the shares that vest or 50% of the options
which are exercised on each occasion.
Thereafter executive directors are required to
increase their personal shareholding
gradually, on each occasion using 25% of the
shares that vest or 25% of the options
exercised each year, until a personal
shareholding equal to 200% of annual salary
is achieved and maintained. These limits are
reviewed periodically. Details of the directors'
personal shareholdings are shown in table A.
Post retirement benefits
The executive directors of the company are
members of group pension schemes and have
a normal retirement age of 60, except Michael
Lester and Mark Ronald who have a normal
retirement age of 62. The pension schemes
for the UK-based directors are designed to
produce a target pension of two-thirds of final
pensionable earnings if potential service is 20
or more years. Final pensionable earnings is
38 BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003
For options granted from 2004 onwards,
performance will be retested once only at the
end of year five. Satisfaction of the re-testing
provision requires on average real EPS
growth of 3%, 4% or 5% (in line with the
percentage of options exercisable as set out
above) over the full five-year period. Thus,
where the re-testing provision is applied, total
real EPS growth of 25% over the five-year
period would be required to enable option
grants to be exercised at 100%. Policy on
re-testing provisions will be reviewed annually
by the Committee.
In determining the performance measure for
the Executive Share Option Plan, the
Committee took the view that our major
investors believe EPS to be a key indicator of
long-term financial performance and value
creation.
Performance Share Plan
From 1996 to 2000 conditional awards of
shares were made to executive directors
under the Performance Share Plan which was
approved by shareholders in 1996. All such
awards have vested or lapsed in accordance
with the relevant performance measures as
set out in the note to table C. 
Following consultation with principal
shareholders and institutional investor bodies
in 2003, conditional awards were granted to
executive directors under the Performance
Share Plan for which the eventual quantum
capable of exercise will be determined by a
TSR ranking relative to a comparator group of
18 other defence and aerospace companies
operating in the international arena. TSR will
continue to be used in 2004 as the principal
measure due to its importance to our
shareholders as an indication of both
earnings and capital growth relative to major
global defence and aerospace companies. A
relative measure is considered important as
it rewards management if they outperform
against major companies in the same sector
rather than success possibly being
determined solely by growth in stock markets.
The Committee formed the view that use of a
sectoral comparator group was considered by
our principal shareholders and institutional
investor bodies to be more appropriate than
using the FTSE 100 as had been the case
historically with awards under this plan. In
recognition of our principal shareholders' and
institutional investor bodies' requirement to
retain a secondary financial measure (which
was previously EPS), release of the awards
will also be conditional on the Committee
being satisfied that there is a sustained
improvement in the company's underlying
financial performance. 
Performance for the 2004 award will therefore
be measured as follows: 
(i) total shareholder return (TSR)
100% of the conditional shares are 
awarded to directors if the company's TSR 
over a three-year period is in the top 20% 
of TSRs achieved by a comparator group of 
18 other major global defence and 
aerospace companies, with 25% vesting if 
the TSR is in the top 50%. Intermediate 
positions will be calculated on a 
straight-line pro-rata basis. No awards will 
be made if the company's performance is 
outside the top 50%. Awards will be made 
in three equal instalments at the end of 
years three, four and five; 
(ii) underlying financial performance
as a secondary measure the Committee 
will consider whether there has been a 
sustained improvement in the company's 
underlying financial performance and 
whether it is appropriate to release some 
or all of the awards. In taking a view of a 
sustained improvement in underlying 
financial performance, the Committee may 
consider (but not exclusively) the following 
financial metrics: net debt/cash; PBIT; 
order book; turnover; risk; and underlying 
project performance.
Awards in 2004 will continue to be granted at
a value equal to the individual director's
base salary.
Restricted Share Plan
Executive directors who participate in the
annual bonus scheme may be given the
option of taking any net cash bonus paid
partly or wholly in shares through the
Restricted Share Plan. If an election is made
to take shares through the plan, they are held
in trust for a period of three years after which
the company awards the individual an equal
number of shares provided the individual
remained in the company's employment at
the vesting date. Where executive directors
have previously elected to apply such bonus
through the Restricted Share Plan, details of
the shares held and vested in 2003 are set
out in table B. The matching award of shares
is not subject to any performance criteria as
the scheme is designed to retain key staff
and to encourage executives to re-invest in
  basic salary averaged over the last 12 months
prior to leaving service. Pensions can be paid
before normal retirement age, subject to the
consent of the company and pension scheme
trustees. These schemes also provide a lump
sum death-in-service benefit equal to four
times basic salary at date of death, and a
spouse's pension equal to two-thirds of the
prospective pension at normal retirement age
or, once retired, of the actual pension in
payment (before any lump sum commutation).
Children's allowances are also payable, usually
up to the age of 18, upon death in service or
death in retirement. If the directors leave with
a deferred pension and die after age 50 but
before the pension has commenced, a lump
sum benefit is paid equal to five times the
annual rate of pension that would have been
paid had the deferred pension commenced
immediately before date of death. If a director
dies with a deferred pension before age 50, a
refund of his contributions will be paid and a
pension will be paid to his legal spouse in line
with the rules of the scheme for all group
employees. Pensions are increased annually
by the rise in the Retail Prices Index subject to
a maximum increase of 5% per year. Directors
pay contributions at the same rate as all other
employees participating in the schemes.
Of the executive directors, George Rose is
affected by the Inland Revenue earnings cap
on approved pensions and has an
unapproved (i.e. non-tax qualified) pension
arrangement to top up his benefits from the
approved schemes. This is designed so that
the total pension from all sources will be
broadly in line with the pension he would
have received from the group pension
schemes, had he not been subject to the
pensions cap. Further information on the
amounts paid by the company in respect of
these arrangements is included in the notes
to table F.
Mark Ronald is covered by the company's US
pension arrangements and the non-qualified
supplemental arrangements in place under
his contract. Mark Ronald's aggregate
retirement benefit is determined based upon
his average salary and service in accordance
with individual plan documents and
contractual agreements and is broadly 
one-thirtieth of average annual pay (including
bonus) for each year of service. In addition
he receives benefits from predecessor
schemes. Having passed his normal
retirement age of 62, he has been in receipt
of benefits payable under the non-qualified
supplemental arrangements since the
BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 39
beginning of 2004. In line with the rules of
the US arrangements, it is not expected that
the pensions will be increased once in
payment. Death benefits under the plans are
provided by a pension continuation to his
spouse or dependants in accordance with
specific payments from each scheme.
Members of US plans have the right to
change the form of pension payments, on a
cost neutral basis, if they wish to have a
different level of spouse and dependant
pension.
Under the rules of the schemes, Sir Richard
Evans and Michael Lester commenced their
pensions in 2002 having reached normal
retirement age. Neither of these two
executive directors has accrued further
benefits since retiring other than pension
increases awarded to all pensioner members
of their pension schemes. Sir Charles
Masefield, who retired from the Board on
28 February 2003, had a normal retirement
age of 62 and, under the rules of the
scheme, commenced his pension in 2002
having reached normal retirement age. He,
too, did not accrue further benefits once
having retired other than pension increases
awarded to all pensioner members of his
pension scheme.
Details of post retirement benefits are shown
in table F and are calculated in accordance
with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the
Companies Act 1985.
Other benefits
Other benefits provided to the executive
directors include a car allowance, cash
allowance for medical examination and, where
appropriate, second residence support
allowance. Recognising the need for the chief
executive to spend a substantial amount of
time in central London on company business,
the Committee agreed in 2003 to make a
payment of  46,123 to Mike Turner towards
meeting the costs of accommodation required
in London. A further payment of  25,000 will
be made in each of the years 2004 and
2005. These payments are in line with group
policy for second residence support.
The graph above, which has been produced in accordance with the
requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985, shows the
total shareholder return for a holding in the company's ordinary shares
for the period 1998 - 2003 relative to a holding of shares representing
the FTSE 100. The FTSE 100 is considered to be an appropriate
comparator for this purpose as it is a broad equity market index. As
BAE Systems is a constituent member of the FTSE 100, it was deemed
to be the most appropriate general UK equity index.

Service contracts
It is the Committee's policy that executive
directors should normally have service
contracts that provide for the company to
give the individual 12 months notice of
termination. This policy has been chosen
because it provides a reasonable balance
between the need to retain the services of key
individuals and the need to limit the liabilities
of the company in the event of the termination
of a contract. The executive directors have
service contracts with group companies;
details of these contracts are shown in the
table above.
Sir Richard Evans has a contract requiring
him to work three days a week in his capacity
as chairman. This was signed on 16 July
2002, amending a contract entered into on
24 September 1998, and was further
amended on 15 January 2004. This contract
can be terminated by either party giving six
months notice. 
Sir Charles Masefield's contract expired on
28 February 2003 and he retired as a
director on that date. Since then Sir Charles
has continued to be employed by the
company on a part-time basis in an overseas
representational role for which he is being
remunerated as set out in the notes to
table E.
In the event of the termination of an
executive director's contract it is the
Committee's policy to seek to limit any
payment made in lieu of notice to a payment
equal to the amount of one year's basic
salary. The service contracts for all of the
executive directors contain specific provisions
to the effect that the company has the right
to pay a sum equivalent to 12 months salary
in the event of the company terminating their
contracts for reasons other than gross
misconduct. Under the terms of his contract
Mark Ronald is entitled to compensation of a
lump sum equal to 12 months salary, and the
continuance of medical benefits for
18 months, if his contract is terminated by
BAE Systems North America, his directorship
of the parent company ceases, or his contract
is not renewed at the end of its rolling 
one-year term. He will also be entitled to
exercise outstanding options and share
awards will vest, subject to satisfaction of any
applicable performance conditions.
Non-executive directors do not have service
contracts but do have letters of appointment
detailing the basis of their appointment. The
dates of their original appointment (with the
exception of Lord Hesketh) are as follows:
Non-executive Date of Expiry of current
director appointment term*

P Scaroni 22.11.2000 21.11.2006
* subject to re-election at the AGM at intervals of no more than
three years in accordance with the company's Articles of Association
Non-executive directors are normally appointed
for two consecutive three-year terms subject to
review after the end of the first three-year
period. They do not have periods of notice and
the company has no obligation to pay
compensation when their appointment
terminates. They are subject to re-election at
the Annual General Meeting following their
appointment and subsequently at intervals of
no more than three years.
Lord Hesketh was appointed as a 
non-executive director on 1 January 1994 and
has exceptionally served three terms. With
effect from 1 January 2004 he will be subject
to re-election at the AGM on an annual basis
as required by the revised Combined Code.
Paolo Scaroni will be retiring from the Board at
the conclusion of this year's AGM. Sir Robin
Biggam and Keith Brown retired from the Board
at the 2003 AGM on 29 April 2003; they were
originally appointed to the Board on 1 January
1994 and 16 March 1989 respectively.
The letters of appointment for non-executive
directors detail the amount of time it is
anticipated that the individual will normally
need to devote to his or her duties as a
director. Non-executive directors are proposed
by the Nominations Committee and are
appointed by the Board on the basis of their
experience to provide independent judgement
on issues of strategy, performance, resources
and standards of conduct. The level of their
fees is set after reviewing practice in other
comparable companies. 
Non-executive directors are paid a basic fee
reflecting the time commitment required of
the director. In addition, the chairmen of the
individual committees receive a fee in
recognition of their duties of chairmen of the
respective committees, reflecting their
additional responsibilities and workload. Fees
payable to non-executive directors are agreed
by the Board; the non-executive directors
themselves do not participate in board
discussions or vote on matters concerning
their fees. Details of the non-executives' fees
are shown in the notes to table E.

Michael Lester holds a non-beneficial interest in 200,000 (2002 200,000) ordinary shares. The 5,190,100 (2002 5,190,100) capital amortising loan stock previously held by Michael Lester on a 
non-beneficial basis was fully redeemed on 28 November 2003.
The executive directors, in common with all employees of the company, have an interest in the unallocated shares held in employee share ownership trusts. As at 
31 December 2003, 2,344,928 such shares were held in the ESOP trust and 331,209 shares in the Profit Sharing Scheme trust.

The Committee is of the opinion that to give a full statement of directors' share options and long-term incentive scheme interests would result in a statement of excessive
length. Therefore disclosure is in accordance with paragraph 9 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985. The company's register of directors' interests (which is open to
inspection) contains full details of directors' shares interests. Details of directors' interests in the share option schemes and long-term incentive plans are shown in
tables B, C and D. The figures in the tables that form part of this report have been calculated by reference to a mid-market price for the company's ordinary shares at
31 December 2003 of 168.25p (2002 124p). The range during 2003 was 196.5p to 101.75p. At the year end none of the unexercised share options granted to the
directors were capable of being exercised at a profit.

At the time of the merger between British Aerospace and the MES business, the Committee agreed that the retention of Mark Ronald as head of the North American
business was key to the success of that business and as a result a one-off award was made to him on 30 April 2000 through the Share Investment Plan. Under the rules
of this plan, if he retained shares for a period of at least three years, the company would award him an equivalent number of shares on the third anniversary of the holding
period. These retained shares are shown under Mark Ronald's personal shareholding in table A. The award made under the plan was not subject to performance criteria,
other than that the individual remained in the company's employment, as the prime objective was to retain his services.
The aggregate net value of assets received by directors in 2003 from long-term incentive plans, as calculated at date of release from trust, was  217,745.

ceased to be a director on 28 February 2003
The terms and conditions of the options detailed above were not varied during the period 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2003.
The mid-market price for the company's ordinary shares at 31 December 2003 was 168.25p (2002 124p). The range during 2003 was 196.5p to 101.75p. At the year end none of the unexercised
share options granted to the directors were capable of being exercised at a profit.
Executive Share Option Plan
The BAE Systems Executive Share Option Plan has been used to grant options to the executive directors since 2001. The performance conditions applying to the
grants of options made in 2001, 2002 and 2003 are the same as for grants to be made in 2004, as set out on page 37 of this report with the exception of the
re-testing provision; for grants made between 2001 - 2003, where the original three-year performance target is not met, performance is re-tested at the end of
years four and five against the full period from grant. The options will lapse at the end of year five if the targets have not been achieved.
Before 1996, and also on the completion of the British Aerospace/MES merger in 1999, options were granted to executive directors under the predecessor
Executive Share Option Scheme. Options granted in 1995 can only be exercised if growth in the pre-exceptional EPS for any three-year period exceeds the sum of
inflation for that period and a real growth requirement of 7.5%. Options granted to the former GEC directors in 1999 were made on a similar basis but the real
growth requirement is 9% for any three-year period. Options granted to other executive directors in 1999 were conditional on the satisfaction of a performance
condition based on the achievement of cost savings of the merger integration process over a three-year performance period. Options will become exercisable on a
sliding scale from zero to 100% between achievement of the base synergy cost savings target of  275m and the full stretch target of  400m.
Performance Share Plan
From 1996 to 2000 conditional awards of shares were made to executive directors under the Performance Share Plan which was approved by shareholders in
1996. All such awards have now vested or lapsed in accordance with the relevant performance measure, with those lapsing in 2003 detailed above. Performance
was measured relative to the other constituent members of the FTSE 100 over a three-year period, with 100% of the conditional shares vesting if the company's
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) was in the top 20% of TSRs achieved by FTSE 100 companies, 10% vesting if the TSR was in the top 50%, and intermediate
positions being calculated on a straight line pro-rata basis. Vesting was also subject to a secondary measure requiring the EPS excluding exceptional items over
the performance period to be no less than the average value for the three years prior to the performance period. Awards were made in three equal instalments at
the end of years three, four and five.
Performance conditions for the 2003 awards are the same as for awards to be made in 2004, as set out on page 38 of this report.

All emoluments and compensation paid to the directors during the year is shown above. Where the individual was appointed during the year the amount shown is
for the period from appointment.
The benefits received by all the executive directors except for Mark Ronald, were cash allowances for a medical examination and for the provision of a car. The
benefits for Mike Turner also included a second residence support allowance of  46,123 for the costs of accommodation required in central London. The benefits
received by Mark Ronald were a cash allowance for a car, fuel and maintenance for the car, annual medical examination and medical insurance related benefits,
and country club membership.
During 2003, non-executive directors were paid a basic fee of  30,000 per annum reflecting the time commitment required as a director and were also paid a fee
of  1,000 for each of the six scheduled Board meetings that they attended. Up to 28 April 2003 the chairman of the Audit Committee and the Nominations and
Compensation Committee each received an additional fee of  6,000 in recognition of their duties as chairman of those committees. Following changes to the
committee structure from 29 April 2003, and to reflect the increasing time commitment required by the committee chairmen to fulfil their duties, the fees of the
committee chairmen were reviewed and amended so that the chairmen of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee received additional annual fees
of  29,000 and  14,000 respectively and the chairman of the Nominations Committee, who is also the senior independent director, received an additional annual
fee of  14,000.
Sir Charles Masefield retired as a director on 28 February 2003 but remains employed by the company on a part-time basis in an overseas representational role.
From 1 March 2003 to 31 December 2003 his remuneration was  235,000 and comprised salary and a cash allowance for a car. There were no other payments
to former directors during the year other than the payment to Richard Lapthorne referred to in the notes to table F.

* Mark Ronald has exercised a right, allowed under the rules of his supplementary arrangements, for part of his overall pension to be paid for a period of 10 years instead of for the 
remainder of his life. This right is granted on a cost neutral basis, and the 10 year pension is calculated by multiplying the whole life pension by an actuarial factor. Of the total accrued 
pension at 31 December 2003,  227,518 will be paid for a period of 10 years only. The corresponding accrued pension at 31 December 2002 allowing for the exercise of this right was
 344,892 (of which  189,674 would have been payable for 10 years) and this pension has, for consistency, been used to calculate the increase in accrued benefits in 2003. The 2002
remuneration report disclosed an accrued pension of  275,578 at 31 December 2002 - this figure assumed the right would not be exercised. Of Mark Ronald's total accrued pension at 31
December 2003,  141,833 has a contingent 50% spouse's pension.
** the transfer value at 1 January 2003 is different from the transfer value of  2,338,500 disclosed in the 2002 remuneration report. The transfer value disclosed last year, as calculated
by independent actuaries, assumed that certain benefits would commence at age 65 instead of Mark Ronald's actual normal retirement age of 62 and, in addition, it did not take full account
of his actual pensionable pay at the end of 2002.
Mark Ronald reached his normal retirement age of 62 in 2003. Mark Ronald ceased to accrue any additional benefits under his non-qualified supplemental pension
arrangements after 31 December 2003, and payments commenced under these arrangements in January 2004. The payments are subject to his right to elect to receive
lump sum payments in lieu of non-qualified supplemental pension payments. Under the rules of the North America Qualified Plan, Mark Ronald will continue to accrue
benefits under the plan until his actual retirement from company service. The accrued pensions and transfer value at 31 December 2003 set out in the table above take
account of the pension benefits already in payment. Mark Ronald participates in the Section 401(k) defined contribution arrangement set up for US employees in which the
company will match employee contributions up to a limit. In 2003, the company paid contributions of $2,200 (2002 $2,000) into Mark Ronald's 401(k) arrangement. 
George Rose's unapproved retirement arrangement is partly funded and partly unfunded. The company's pension contribution to the funded unapproved retirement
arrangement for George Rose in 2003 was  1,237,697 (2002  320,172). There were two main reasons behind the need to pay a substantially higher contribution in
2003; the need to change the actuarial basis underlying the calculations and investment under-performance. The revised actuarial basis is consistent with the funding
basis used for the approved pension schemes (with adjustments to take account of the different tax treatment). This change accounts for approximately  735,000 of the
contribution in 2003. The company has decided to deal with the under-performance of the underlying investments over a three-year period and, of the amount paid in
2003,  172,000 is accounted for by this item; similar payments are planned for the years 2004 and 2005 (subject to the impact of the UK government's new pension
taxation proposals). This treatment reflects our policy for other employees in the same position. The balance of  331,000 represents the normal contributions expected in
any one year and this compares directly with the payment in 2002 of  320,172. The accrued benefits shown in table F above include the benefits from the approved and
unapproved arrangements.

Under the rules of the schemes, Sir Richard Evans and Michael Lester commenced their pensions in 2002 having reached normal retirement age. Sir Charles Masefield,
who retired from the Board on 28 February 2003, also commenced his pension in 2002 having reached normal retirement age. None of these three individuals have
accrued further benefits since retiring other than pension increases awarded to all pensioner members of their pension schemes.
Richard Lapthorne, a former director, has an unfunded pension scheme. In 2003 the company paid Richard Lapthorne  82,758 (2002  81,375) in respect of this
arrangement.
