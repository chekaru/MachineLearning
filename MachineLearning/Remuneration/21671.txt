 42 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2004
Levels of remuneration should be sufficient 
to attract, retain and motivate directors of the
quality required to run the company successfully,
but a company should avoid paying more than 
is necessary for this purpose.A significant
proportion of executive directors' remuneration
should be structured so as to link rewards 
to corporate and individual performance.  
Combined Code - Main Principle B.1
There should be a formal and transparent
procedure for developing policy on executive
remuneration and for fixing the remuneration
packages of individual directors. No director
should be involved in deciding his or her own
remuneration. 
Combined Code - Main Principle B.2
The Remuneration Committee
Members: 
Prof Sue Birley (Chairman)
Dr Ulrich Cartellieri
Sir Peter Mason
Responsible for:
- agreeing a policy for the remuneration of 
the Chairman and executive directors;
- within the agreed policy, determining
individual remuneration packages for the
Chairman and executive directors;
- agreeing the terms and conditions to 
be included in service agreements for
executive directors;
- approving any employee share based
incentive schemes and any performance
conditions to be used for such schemes;
- determining targets for any bonuses or
performance related share schemes
operated by the company.
(The full terms of reference of the Remuneration
Committee can be found on the company' s website 
or can be obtained from the Company Secretary.)
The Board has delegated to the Remuneration
Committee responsibility for remuneration
policy and determining the specific packages 
for the executive directors and the Chairman. It
also agrees the framework for the
remuneration of certain other members of the
executive management team. The Committee's
terms of reference conform with the
requirements of the Combined Code. 
The Committee is chaired by Sue Birley and all 
of its members are independent non-executive
directors. Lord Hesketh also served as a
member of the Committee until 25 February
2004 when he stepped down from that role as
he was no longer deemed to be independent
under the provisions of the Combined Code. The
company's Chairman and Chief Executive attend
committee meetings by invitation only. They do
not attend where their individual remuneration is
discussed and no director is involved in deciding
his own remuneration.
In 2004, the Committee met seven times and
details of attendance at these meetings are
provided in the Corporate Governance Report 
on page 35. 
During the year Sir Richard Evans (until he retired
as Chairman), Dick Olver (since his appointment
as Chairman) and Mike T urner (as Chief
Executive) provided advice that was of material
assistance to the Committee. The Committee
also received material assistance and advice on
remuneration policy from the company' s Group
Human Resources Director , Alastair Imrie, and
from the Human Resources Director ,
Remuneration and Benefits, Graham Middleton.
In addition, the Committee received advice and
services from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC )
in respect of the provision and interpretation of
comparative senior management remuneration
data. PwC were appointed by the company and
during the year they provided consulting services
to other parts of the BAE Systems group. The
Committee is satisfied that the services
provided to it by PwC were of a technical nature
and did not create any conflict of interest with
the company . If a conflict of interest were to arise
in the future, the Committee would appoint other
consultants in place of PwC.
Remuneration principles
The Committee' s remuneration strategy is 
to provide a remuneration package that:
- helps attract, retain and motivate the highest
calibre executives;
- is aligned to shareholders' interests to create
sustainable long-term shareholder value;
- is competitive against the appropriate
market, providing median reward for median
performance and upper quartile reward for
upper quartile performance;
- encourages and supports a high performance
culture whilst providing a balance between
fixed and variable reward;
- is fair and transparent and can be applied
consistently throughout the group.
During the year the Committee has undertaken
the following in order to discharge its
responsibilities:
- set performance targets for the year and
reviewed progress against those targets;
- agreed policy for executive share scheme
grants including the level of individual 
grants and performance conditions;
- agreed policy for the operation of the 
all-employee share schemes;
- awarded bonuses based on the prior year' s
performance;
- determined the fee level for the incoming
Chairman;
- agreed the basis for the annual review of
executive directors' remuneration, including
the composition of the comparator groups;
- reviewed the levels and structure of
remuneration payable to senior executives;
-reviewed the discretionary elements of the
executive share plans; and
- reviewed the remuneration report.

 Executive directors
Remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee' s (the Committee)
executive remuneration policy continues to be 
to set basic salaries at median competitive 
levels whilst seeking to reward upper quartile
performance with potential upper quartile
remuneration through the use of bonus schemes
and share-based incentives. The Committee
intends to continue with the executive
remuneration policy as detailed in this report in
2005, and will continue to consult on material
changes with principal shareholders. The
Committee intends to undertake a formal review
of remuneration policy in the second half of 2005.  
Remuneration of executive directors consists
typically of basic salary, a bonus based on 
annual performance, participation in employee
share schemes and retirement benefits. The
Committee reviews the split between basic 
salary and the performance related elements 
of remuneration each year in order to incentivise
properly executive directors, and believes that a
significant proportion of remuneration should be
based on schemes that encourage them to
perform at the highest level. Through this
arrangement, it is possible for those individuals
who contribute to sustained high levels of
company performance to receive at least a similar
level of reward from variable compensation to 
that received from fixed compensation. At median
performance, variable remuneration represents
approximately 50% of the remuneration package
as shown in the chart below: 
Non-Executive Directors' Fees Committee
Members: 
Dick Olver (Chairman)
Michael Lester
Mark Ronald
Mike T urner
Responsible for:
- reviewing the fees payable to non-executive
directors (excluding the Chairman) and making
changes to such fees as deemed appropriate.
(The full terms of reference of the Non-Executive Directors'
Fees Committee can be found on the company' s website 
or can be obtained from the Company Secretary.)
The Non-Executive Directors' Fees Committee
was formed by the Board in January 2005 
with authority on its behalf to agree fees 
payable to non-executive directors. This 
role was undertaken previously by the Board 
as a whole.
The Board has approved the following guidelines
to be used by the Committee when discharging
its responsibilities:
- fees shall be sufficient to attract and retain
individuals with the necessary skills,
experience and knowledge required to ensure
that the Board is able to discharge its duties
effectively; 
- in setting fees the Committee shall have
regard to the amount of time individual 
non-executive directors are required to
devote to their duties and also the scale 
and complexity of the business and the
responsibility involved;
- fees payable to non-executive directors 
shall be paid in cash and shall not be
performance related;
- non-executive directors shall not participate 
in the company' s share based incentive
schemes or pension scheme.
The Committee has held one meeting, that 
was attended by all members, at which it
agreed the changes to the structure of 
non-executive directors' fees detailed 
on page 48 of this report.
The Committee seeks to align the interests 
of executive directors with those of other
shareholders through the use of share based
incentive schemes. The company operates a
combination of option and share based awards
for executive directors within the following
framework which is in line with similar plans
operated by other FTSE 100 companies: 
-awards under the Performance Share Plan to 
be set at 1 x salary with the eventual quantum
capable of exercise being determined by a 
Total Shareholder Return performance (share
price growth plus dividends) over a three year
performance period, and release of awards also
being subject to a secondary financial measure; 
- option grants under the Executive Share
Option Plan to be set at a maximum of 1.5 x
salary with performance conditions based 
on earnings per share (EPS) growth. 
In respect of grants of options in 2004, the
Committee decided to allow one re-test only at
the end of year five against the full period from
grant and stated that it would further review policy
prior to any grant of options in 2005. Having
subsequently reviewed the policy relating to re-
tests, the Committee has decided not to permit
any re-tests for options to be granted in 2005.
The Committee is mindful of the need to 
ensure consistent measurement of corporate
performance which determines the outcome of
incentive arrangements during the transition to
International Financial Reporting Standards and
will be formulating its policy in this regard in 2005.
The long-standing policy of allowing executive
directors to hold external non-BAE Systems
related non-executive directorships with the
prior approval of the Committee will continue.
The Committee considers that external
directorships provide the company's senior
executives with valuable experience that is of
benefit to BAE Systems. It is also considered
appropriate for BAE Systems, as a FTSE 100
company, to contribute to the pool of
non-executive expertise available for the

At upper quartile performance, variable remuneration
represents significantly more than 50% 44 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2004
benefit of the wider business community,
thereby reciprocating the benefit which it in turn
has received from other organisations which
have permitted members of their senior
management teams to serve in a non-executive
capacity on the BAE Systems Board. The
Committee believes that it is reasonable 
for the individual director to retain any fees 
received from such appointments given the
additional personal responsibility that this
entails. Such fees retained by full-time 
executive directors in 2004 were as follows:
Michael Lester:  33,000; George Rose:
 65,000; and Mike T urner:  27,000.
Basic salary 
Executive directors' salaries are reviewed each
year by the Committee and adjusted to reflect
performance and the competitiveness of
salaries relative to the market. Information on
the market for comparable management
positions is obtained from independent sources
and is provided to the Committee so that it can
form a view as to where to position basic salaries
and benefits relative to comparable companies. 
The methodology used is to construct
appropriate comparator groups for the individual
positions taking account of company size, scale
of operations and breadth of role. The median
and upper quartile positions are then analysed
for base salary, total cash reward (base salary
plus annual bonus), total direct reward (total
cash reward plus long-term incentives) and total
reward including pension.  This gives the
Committee a view on the competitiveness of
the individual elements of the package as well
as the package as a whole. The Committee 
also reviews the trends in the elements of
remuneration to ensure that the structure of 
the package stays in line with market practice,
and also takes account of the performance of
the individual, the company as a whole and the
pay and conditions of group employees. 
For the Chief Executive and Group Finance
Director , two comparator groups were
constructed: the Core Group consists of the 
19 FTSE 100 companies (excluding financial
institutions) with turnover closest to BAE Systems
(nine larger and ten smaller). The Large
Companies Group consists of the 23 FTSE 100
companies (excluding financial institutions) with
turnover larger than  8bn. The turnover figure
was chosen as it represents the company' s
turnover in 2003 for its wholly owned
businesses - if total group turnover had been
used, the figure would have been almost  13bn.
These two comparator groups give a reasonable
range within which the package should be
positioned.  The Committee also reviewed the
data for aerospace and defence companies
within the FTSE 100. 
For the UK Chief Operating Officers, regression
analysis was used to produce appropriate
market figures consistent with the size and
scale of their businesses, adjusting where
necessary to reflect the extra responsibility 
for the Board roles. For the US Chief Operating
Officer , a similar exercise was undertaken 
based on US company data and, in addition,
the packages of similarly sized CEOs' roles 
were analysed within the US aerospace,
defence and general industry sector . 
There was no readily available market data 
for the Group Legal Director . For this role the
Committee analysed data for the most senior
legal position within FTSE 100 companies
(adjusting where necessary for board
responsibility) together with available data 
on the remuneration of senior lawyers within
large London law firms. 
As a result of this review, the Committee
decided to increase the base salary of the
executive directors with effect from 1 January
2005 to the following:
Mike T urner 
Chief Executive  800,000
George Rose 
Group Finance Director  500,000
Chris Geoghegan 
UK Chief Operating Officer  445,000
Steve Mogford 
UK Chief Operating Officer  445,000
Mark Ronald 
US Chief Operating Officer $850,000
Michael Lester 
Group Legal Director  540,000
Annual Bonus Plan
The executive directors and other senior
executives participate in a cash bonus plan 
that rewards those individuals if pre-determined
targets are met. The targets are derived from 
the Integrated Business Plan (IBP), which is
agreed by the Board and which implements
corporate strategy on a groupwide basis by
ensuring that business plans which support the
strategy are integrated across all businesses.
The IBP is used to set the objectives for senior
management including the base and stretch
targets for the financial measures used for the
executive directors in the Annual Bonus Plan.
Non-financial targets comprise key objectives
relevant to the individual and/or business and
also take account of behavioural performance.
The targets for the executive directors are
agreed and monitored by the Committee.
2004 was a very successful year with all the
major business groups achieving their stretch
targets on profit and cash. As a result, all the
financial targets within the 2004 Annual Bonus
Plan for executive directors were met at the
stretch level. In addition, excellent progress
was made against the majority of the key 
non-financial objectives, but the lack of
progress in winning more export orders is
disappointing and more work remains to be
done in 2005 on securing technology transfer
from the US to the UK. Accordingly, bonus
payments for 2004, which are set out in 
T able E on page 52, range from 94.5% to 
98% of the maximum bonus.
As a result of its annual review of the
performance related part of the remuneration
package, the Committee has determined that
the maximum bonus potential for 2005 will
remain unchanged from 2004 at 100% of 
salary (150% of salary for the US-based
executive director , Mark Ronald). The differential
between the UK and US-based executive
directors takes account of the difference 
in local market practices.
The structure of the Bonus Plan for executive
directors in 2005 (expressed as percentages 
of base salary) is as follows:
Chief Executive, Group Finance Director,
and Group Legal Director
Base Stretch
Bonus element T arget T arget
EPS targets 18.75% 37.5%
Group cash targets 18.75% 37.5%

Business unit cash target 9.375% 18.75%
Non-financial objectives up to 25%
*  PBIT = Profit before interest and tax
(A similar bonus structure applies for the 
US-based Chief Operating Officer , prorated to 
his maximum bonus entitlement of 150%). 
Intermediate payments are payable for
performance against these targets. The Chairman and the non-executive directors
do not participate in the Annual Bonus Plan.
In determining the performance measures for
the Annual Bonus Plan, the Committee took 
the view that the company' s major investors
believed earnings per share (EPS) and cash
targets (and, where appropriate, PBIT) to be key
indicators of long-term financial performance
and value creation. These, coupled with the 
non-financial measures, align the executive
directors' objectives with corporate strategy 
and targeted business performance.
The EPS figure used for the bonus plan (and 
the Executive Share Option Plan) is based on
basic EPS excluding goodwill amortisation and
impairment and exceptional items and may be
adjusted if necessary to ensure that the figures
for individual years are broadly comparable.
Share option schemes and long-term 
incentive schemes
Performance conditions for grants of options 
or awards to be made under the Executive 
Share Option Plan and the Performance Share
Plan in 2005 are detailed below. Performance
conditions for earlier grants under the Executive
Share Option Plan are shown as notes to
Table C. Performance conditions for grants 
of awards under the Performance Share Plan 
made in 2003 and 2004 are the same as for
awards to be made in 2005 as detailed below.
Executive Share Option Plan
Options granted under the Executive Share
Option Plan are normally exercisable between
the third and tenth anniversary of their grant.
Options may only be exercised during this 
period as follows:
- 33.33% of each option grant is exercisable 
if the company achieves on average real 
EPS growth per annum of 3% but less than 
4% over the three year performance period;
- 66.67% of each option grant is exercisable 
if the company achieves on average real 
EPS growth per annum of 4% but less than 
5% over the three year performance period;
- 100% of each option grant is exercisable if
the company achieves on average real EPS
growth per annum of 5% or more over the
three year performance period.
In determining the performance measure for 
the Executive Share Option Plan, the Committee
took the view that the company' s major investors
believed EPS to be a key indicator of long-term
financial performance and value creation.
There will be no re-testing after the three year
performance period for options to be granted 
in 2005. 
Performance Share Plan
Conditional awards of shares are made under
the Performance Share Plan which are
contingent on meeting pre-determined
performance criteria. The quantum of shares
under award which are capable of being
exercised is determined by the company' s T otal
Shareholder Return ranking relative to a
comparator group of 18 other defence and
aerospace companies operating in the
international arena. 
Awards in 2005 will continue to be granted at a
value equal to the individual' s base salary and
performance for the 2005 award will be
measured as follows: 
(i) total shareholder return (TSR)
100% of the conditional shares are awarded
to directors if the company' s TSR over a three
year period is in the top 20% of TSRs
achieved by the sectoral comparator group,
with 25% vesting if the TSR is in the top 50%.
Intermediate positions will be calculated on a
straight-line pro-rata basis. No awards will be
made if the company' s performance is
outside the top 50%. Awards will be made in
three equal instalments at the end of years
three, four and five. 
(ii) underlying financial performance
As a secondary measure the Committee will
consider whether there has been a sustained
improvement in the company' s underlying
financial performance and whether it is
appropriate to release some or all of the
awards. In taking a view of a sustained
improvement in underlying financial
performance,the Committee may consider (but
not exclusively) the following financial metrics:
net debt/cash; PBIT; order book; turnover; 
risk and underlying project performance.
A sectoral TSR peer group will continue to be
used in 2005 as the principal performance
measure due to its importance to the company' s
shareholders as an indication of both earnings
and capital growth relative to major global
defence and aerospace companies. A relative
measure is considered important as it rewards
management if they outperform against major
companies in the same sector rather than
success possibly being determined solely by
growth in stock markets. The second measure
was included to ensure that awards will only vest
if there has been a clear improvement in the
company' s underlying performance over the
relevant period. 
The composition of the TSR sectoral peer group
will not change for awards to be made in 2005.
It comprises:
Boeing Cobham
Dassault Aviation EADS
Embraer PN Finmeccanica
General Dynamics GKN
Goodrich Honeywell International
Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman
Raytheon Rockwell Collins

Restricted Share Plan
Executive directors who participate in the
Annual Bonus Plan may be given the option of
taking any net cash bonus paid partly or wholly
in shares through the Restricted Share Plan. If
an election is made to take shares through the
Restricted Share Plan, they are held in trust for 
a period of three years after which the company
awards the individual an equal number of 
shares provided the individual is in the
company' s employment at the vesting date.
Where executive directors have elected to 
use such bonuses through the Restricted 
Share Plan, details of the shares held are 
set out in T able B.
The matching award of shares is not subject 
to any performance criteria as the Restricted
Share Plan is operated in conjunction with the
Annual Bonus Plan. This arrangement is
designed to retain key staff and to encourage
executives to re-invest in company shares the
cash bonuses that they have earned under the
Annual Bonus Plan, which is itself based on
performance criteria.
The Committee intends to operate this plan 
in 2005.
SAYE Share Option Scheme
The executive directors (with the exception of
Mark Ronald) are entitled to participate in the
company' s Save-As-Y ou-Earn Share Option
Scheme. Statutory provisions do not allow
options granted under these schemes to be
subject to any performance conditions.
The Committee has decided that no further
grants will be made under the SAYE Share
Option Scheme, but instead, a share purchase
arrangement under the Share Incentive Plan 
will be introduced in 2005.
45 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2004 46 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2004
Share Incentive Plan
During 2004 the UK executive directors were
entitled to participate in the profit-sharing element
of the Share Incentive Plan, an all-employee plan.
As a result of the company' s performance in 2004,
all eligible employees (including the UK executive
directors) will be entitled to receive shares worth
approximately  372.
A similar arrangement operates for non-UK
employees (including Mark Ronald) on a cash 
or shares basis depending on local tax and
security laws. Accordingly, Mark Ronald will be
entitled to receive a cash payment to a similar
value less employer' s social security charges.
Dilution of share capital
The Committee has agreed that shares
representing not more than 1% of the company' s
issued share capital will be used in any one
financial year for the grant of share options
under the employee share schemes. The table
below sets out the available dilution capacity for
the company' s share option schemes

the number of shares granted under 
option during 2004 totalled 24,019,969 
(0.78% of the total shares in issue). 
Personal shareholding policy
The Committee has agreed a policy whereby 
all executive directors are required to establish
and maintain a minimum personal shareholding
equal to 200% of salary . As a minimum, a holding
equal to 100% of salary must be achieved as
quickly as possible using shares vesting, or
options exercised, through the executive share
option schemes or long-term incentive schemes,
by using 50% of the shares that vest or 50% 
of the options which are exercised on each
occasion. Thereafter , executive directors are
required to increase their personal shareholding
gradually, on each occasion using 25% of the
shares that vest or 25% of the options exercised
each year , until a personal shareholding equal 
to 200% of annual salary is achieved and
maintained. These limits are reviewed
periodically . Details of the directors' personal
shareholdings are shown in T able A. 
Post retirement benefits
The executive directors of the company are
members of group pension schemes and have 
a normal retirement age of 60, except Michael
Lester and Mark Ronald who have a normal
retirement age of 62. 
The pension schemes for the UK-based
directors are designed to produce a target
pension of two-thirds of final pensionable
earnings if potential service is 20 or more 
years. Final pensionable earnings is basic
salary averaged over the last 12 months prior 
to leaving service. Pensions can be paid before
normal retirement age, subject to the consent 
of the company and pension scheme trustees.
These schemes also provide a lump sum death
in service benefit equal to four times basic
salary at date of death, and a spouse's pension
equal to two-thirds of the prospective pension 
at normal retirement age or , once retired, of the
actual pension in payment (before any lump sum
commutation). Children' s allowances are also
payable, usually up to the age of 18, upon death
in service or death in retirement. If the directors
leave the company' s employment with a
deferred pension and die after age 50 but before
the pension has commenced, a lump sum
benefit is paid equal to five times the annual
rate of pension that would have been paid had
the deferred pension commenced immediately
before date of death. If a director dies with a
deferred pension before age 50, a refund of his
contributions will be paid and a pension will be
paid to his legal spouse in line with the rules of
the scheme for all group employees. Pensions
are increased annually by the rise in the Retail
Prices Index subject to a maximum increase of
5% per year . Directors pay contributions at the
same rate as all other employees participating
in the schemes.

This graph shows the value, by 31 December 2004, of  100 invested in BAE Systems on 31 December 1999 compared to the
value of  100 invested in the FTSE 100 Index. The other points plotted are the values at intervening year-ends.
The graph, which has been produced in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985, shows 
the total shareholder return for a holding in the company' s ordinary shares for the period 1999 - 2004 relative to a holding of
shares representing the FTSE 100. The FTSE 100 is considered to be an appropriate comparator for this purpose as it is a 
broad equity market index. As BAE Systems is a constituent member of the FTSE 100, it was deemed to be the most appropriate

from the group pension schemes had he not
been subject to the pensions cap. Further
information on the amounts paid by the
company in respect of these arrangements 
is included in the notes to T able F . 
The forthcoming UK tax changes to pensions,
that will come into force on 6 April 2006, will
impact on the UK executive directors who are
below normal retirement age and other senior UK-
based employees. The Committee is considering
this issue and the appropriate approach to take.
Mark Ronald is covered by the company' s US
pension arrangements and the non-qualified
supplemental arrangements in place under 
his contract. He commenced his non-qualified
pension in 2004 having reached his normal
retirement age. This forms the majority of his
entitlement. His remaining entitlement from 
the qualified plan will commence when he
leaves service. In line with the rules of the 
US arrangements, it is not expected that the
pensions will be increased once in payment.
Death benefits under the plans are provided 
by a pension continuation to his spouse or
dependants in accordance with specific
payments from each scheme.
Michael Lester commenced his pension in 2002
having reached normal retirement age under 
the rules of the relevant pension scheme. He
has not accrued further benefits since retiring
other than pension increases awarded to all
pensioner members of his pension scheme.
Sir Richard Evans, who retired from the Board
on 30 June 2004, remains employed by the
company. He had a normal retirement age of
60 and, under the rules of the relevant pension
scheme, commenced his pension in 2002
having reached normal retirement age. He,
too, did not accrue further benefits once 
having retired other than pension increases
awarded to all pensioner members of his
pension scheme. 
Details of post retirement benefits are shown 
in T able F and are calculated in accordance 
with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the
Companies Act 1985 .
Other benefits
Other benefits provided to the executive
directors include a car allowance, cash
allowance for medical examination and,
where appropriate, second residence support
allowance. As reported in 2004, having
recognised the need for the Chief Executive to
spend a substantial amount of time in central
London on company business, the Committee
agreed to make a second residence support
allowance to Mike Turner. A payment of
 25,000 was made in 2004 (2003  46,123)
and a final payment of  25,000 will be 
made in 2005. These payments are in 
line with group policy for second residence
support allowance.
Executive directors' service contracts
It is the Committee's policy that executive
directors should normally have service
contracts that provide for the company to give
the individual 12 months' notice of termination.
This policy has been chosen because it provides
a reasonable balance between the need to
retain the services of key individuals and the
need to limit the liabilities of the company in 
the event of the termination of a contract. 
The executive directors have service contracts
with group companies; details of these
contracts are shown in the table above.
Sir Richard Evans had a contract requiring him 
to work three days a week in his capacity as
Chairman which was signed on 16 July 2002
(and varied on 15 January 2004) and amended
a contract entered into on 24 September 1998.
Sir Richard retired as director and Chairman 
on 30 June 2004. Since that date he has been
employed by the company on a part-time basis,
working two days a week, in a customer
relationship role in a number of key overseas
markets. His remuneration for this role is set 
out in the footnote to T able E. 48 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2004
In the event of the termination of an executive
director' s contract it is the Committee' s policy to
seek to limit any payment made in lieu of notice
to a payment equal to the amount of one year's
basic salary. The service contracts for all of the
executive directors contain specific provisions
to the effect that the company has the right to
pay a sum equivalent to 12 months' salary in the
event of the company terminating their contracts
for reasons other than gross misconduct. None
of the executive directors have provisions in
their service contracts that relate to a change 
of control of the company. Under the terms 
of his contract Mark Ronald is entitled to
compensation of a lump sum equal to
12 months' salary, and the continuance of
medical benefits for 18 months, if his contract 
is terminated by BAE Systems North America,
his directorship of the parent company ceases,
or his contract is not renewed at the end of its
rolling one-year term. He will also be entitled to
exercise outstanding share options and share
awards will vest, subject to satisfaction of any
applicable performance conditions.
Chairman and non-executive directors
Dick Olver succeeded Sir Richard Evans as
Chairman on 1 July 2004 having been appointed
as a non-executive director on 17 May 2004. 
His appointment is for an initial fixed three-year
term with effect from 17 May 2004 and is
documented in a letter of appointment which 
is not a contract of employment. He is required
to devote no less than two days a week to his
duties as Chairman, unless terminated earlier 
in accordance with the company' s Articles of
Association, or by either party giving to the other
not less than six months' prior written notice.
The Nominations Committee will review his
appointment prior to the end of the three-year
term and will, if appropriate (and subject to the
agreement of Mr Olver), recommend to the
Board that he be invited to serve for an
additional period. Having been appointed by the
Board since the 2004 AGM, he will seek initial
re-election by the shareholders at the 2005
AGM. His appointment as Chairman will
automatically terminate if he ceases to be a
director of the company. His fee, which has 
been set by the Committee at  500,000 per
annum (prorated for 2004 from the date of his
appointment as Chairman), will not be subject 
to review during the initial three-year term. 
The non-executive directors do not have service
contracts but do have letters of appointment
detailing the basis of their appointment. The
dates of their original appointment (with the
exception of Lord Hesketh) are as follows:
Non-executive Date of Expiry of 
director appointment current term*
Sue Birley                   22.11.2000 21.11.2006
Ulrich Cartellieri 01.12.1999 30.11.2005
Michael Hartnall 10.06.2003 09.06.2006
Sir Peter Mason 22.01.2003 21.01.2006
Michael Portillo 11.09.2002 10.09.2005
*subject to re-election at the AGM at intervals of no more than
three years in accordance with the company' s Articles of
Association
Non-executive directors are normally appointed
for two consecutive three year terms subject to
review after the end of the first three year period
and with any third term of three years being
subject to rigorous review and taking into
account the need progressively to refresh the
Board. They do not have periods of notice and the
company has no obligation to pay compensation
when their appointment terminates. They are
subject to re-election at the AGM following their
appointment and subsequently at intervals of 
no more than three years.
Lord Hesketh was appointed as a non-executive
director on 1 January 1994 and having served
over three terms he will be retiring from the
Board at the conclusion of this year' s AGM 
on 4 May 2005.
Paolo Scaroni retired from the Board at the
conclusion of the 2004 AGM on 5 May 2004,
having been originally appointed to the Board 
on 22 November 2000.
The letters of appointment for non-executive
directors detail the amount of time it is
anticipated that the individual will need to devote
to his or her duties as a director . Non-executive
directors are proposed by the Nominations
Committee and are appointed by the Board on the
basis of their experience to provide independent
judgement on issues of strategy , performance,
resources and standards of conduct. The level of
their fees is set after reviewing practice in other
comparable companies. 
Non-executive directors are paid a fee reflecting
the time commitment required of the director .
The fee level for the chairmen of the Audit and
Remuneration Committees reflects their
additional responsibilities and workload. Fees
payable to non-executive directors in 2004 were
agreed by the Board; the non-executive directors
themselves did not participate in board
discussions or vote on matters concerning their
fees. Details of the non-executives' fees are
shown in T able E.
The Non-Executive Directors' Fees Committee
has agreed that fees payable to non-executive
directors will remain unchanged in 2005.
However , it has decided that, as the company
has increased the number of board meetings
held in North America and is considering the
potential appointment of US-based 
non-executive directors, a transatlantic meeting
allowance of  4,000 per board meeting should
be introduced. This takes into account the
additional time commitment required by the
European-based non-executive directors to
attend board meetings in the US and similarly
the commitment of potential US-based 
non-executive directors to attend meetings 
in Europe. This allowance applies from the
beginning of 2005.
By order of 
the Board

23 February 2005 Information subject to audit
The auditors are required to report on the information contained in tables B, C, D, E and F on pages 49 to 53.
The Committee is of the opinion that to give a full statement of directors' share options and long-term incentive scheme interests would result in a statement
of excessive length. Therefore disclosure is in accordance with paragraph 9 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985. The company's register of directors'
interests (which is open to inspection) contains full details of directors' shares interests. Details of directors' interests in the share option schemes and 
long-term incentive plans are shown in tables B, C and D. The figures in the tables that form part of this report have been calculated by reference to a 
mid-market price for the company's ordinary shares at 31 December 2004 of 230.5p (2003 168.25p). The range during 2004 was 159p to 257.25p.

The terms and conditions of the options detailed above were not varied during the period 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2004.
The mid market price for the company's ordinary shares at 31 December 2004 was 230.5p (2003 168.25p). The range during 2004 was 159p to 257.25p. 
The performance conditions for the Executive Share Option Plan and the Performance Share Plan are as follows:
Executive Share Option Plan
The BAE Systems Executive Share Option Plan has been used to grant options to the executive directors since 2001. The performance conditions applying to the grants of options made in 2001,
2002, 2003 and 2004 are the same as for grants to be made in 2005, as set out on page 45 of this report, with the exception of the re-testing provision; for grants made between 2001- 2003,
where the original three year performance target is not met, performance is re-tested at the end of years four and five against the full period from grant; for grants made in 2004, where the original
three year performance target is not met, performance is re-tested at the end of year five. In all these cases the option will lapse in year five if the targets have not been achieved. There will be no 
re-testing of performance for grants to be made in 2005.
Before 1996, and also on the completion of the BAE/MES merger in 1999, options were granted to executive directors under the predecessor Executive Share Option Scheme. Options granted in
1995 could only be exercised if growth in the pre-exceptional EPS for any three-year period exceeded the sum of inflation for that period and a real growth requirement of 7.5% was achieved. Options
granted to the former GEC directors in 1999 were made on a similar basis but the real growth requirement is 9% for any three-year period. Options granted to the other executive directors in 1999 were
conditional on the satisfaction of a special performance condition based on achievement of cost savings of the merger integration process over the three-year performance period commencing on 1
January 2000; 57.7% of these options became exercisable in 2004 and the remaining 42.3% lapsed. 
Performance Share Plan
Performance conditions for the awards made in 2003 and 2004 are the same as for awards to be made in 2005 as set out on page 45 of this report.

1 T ransfer values have been calculated in accordance with guidance note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession. For UK-based directors the assumptions are the same as those used for the
calculation of cash equivalents from the group's UK pension schemes. In 2004, the actuary has changed the assumptions used to calculate cash equivalents from the UK pension schemes,
subject to a minimum of the cash equivalent calculated on the statutory MFR basis. This assumption change has, for the majority of the UK-based directors, resulted in a higher transfer value
than that calculated using the assumptions in force at the start of the year . The amount of the increase in change in transfer value arising from the change in assumptions is: Chris Geoghegan
 452,530; Steve Mogford  437,109; George Rose  283,210; Mike T urner  29,631. For directors with pensions in payment, the corresponding increase is Sir Richard Evans  nil and Michael
Lester  100,110. This assumption change does not apply to Mark Ronald.
2 George Rose' s unapproved retirement arrangement is partly funded and partly unfunded. The company' s pension contribution to the funded unapproved retirement arrangement for George
Rose in 2004 was  515,089 (2003  1,237,697). Of this amount, approximately  339,000 (2003  331,000) relates to the cost of benefits accruing during the year and approximately
 176,000 (2003  172,000) relates to dealing with investment under-performance prior to 2003. In 2003, the company decided to deal with the under-performance of the underlying
investments over a three-year period, 2003-2005; the third of these three payments is due to be made in 2005. This treatment reflects company policy for employees with unapproved
arrangements in the same position. The 2003 contribution also included a one-off payment of approximately  735,000 to cover a change in actuarial basis underlying the calculations; 
the revised basis is consistent with the funding basis used for the approved pension schemes (with adjustments to take account of the different tax treatment).

4 Under the rules of his pension arrangements, the majority of Mark Ronald' s pension commenced in January 2004 when he reached normal retirement age. The pension in payment includes 
an accrued pension of $42,104 ( 21,797 at 31 December 2004) from the BAE Systems North America Qualified Plan that will commence when Mark Ronald leaves company service. The
Qualified Plan is a contributory arrangement. Of the pension in payment, $406,322 ( 210,309 at 31 December 2004) is payable up to when he reaches age 72 and $253,242 ( 131,105 
at 31 December 2004) has a contingent 50% spouse' s pension. Mark Ronald continues to participate in a Section 401(k) defined contribution arrangement set up for US employees in which
the company will match employee contributions up to a limit. In 2004 the company paid contributions of $5,036 (2003 $2,200) into Mark Ronald' s 401(k) arrangement.
5 Mark Ronald' s pension is paid in US dollars. Of the change in pension  29,724 is due to currency movements, and  1,588 is due to increases in his accrued pension.
