Governance
The Board has delegated to the
Remuneration Committee responsibility for
remuneration policy and determining the
specific packages for the Chairman and the
executive directors; the Committee also
agrees the framework for the remuneration
of certain other members of the executive
management team. The Committee' s terms
of reference conform with the requirements
of the Combined Code.
The Committee is chaired by Professor 
Sue Birley and all of its members are
independent non-executive directors. 
During the year Dr Ulrich Cartellieri and 
Sir Peter Mason also served as members 
of the Remuneration Committee; they, too,
were independent non-executive directors.
The committee composition changed during
the year as part of the ongoing programme
to refresh the Board and its committees.
The Company' s Chairman and Chief
Executive attend committee meetings by
invitation only. They do not attend where
their individual remuneration is discussed
and no director is involved in deciding his
own remuneration.
In 2005 the Committee met six times and
details of attendance at these meetings are
provided in the Corporate Governance
Report on page 53.
During the year Dick Olver and Mike T urner ,
in their respective capacities as Chairman
and Chief Executive, provided advice that
was of material assistance to the
Committee. The Committee also received
material assistance and advice on
remuneration policy from the Company' s
Group Human Resources Director , Alastair
Imrie, and from the Human Resources
Director , Remuneration and Benefits,
Graham Middleton. In addition, the
Committee received advice and services
from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in
respect of the provision and interpretation 
of comparative senior management
remuneration data and senior executives'
pension arrangements, from New Bridge
Street Consultants (NBSC) in respect of 
the review and operation of share plans,
and from Linklaters in respect of legal
advice. NBSC was appointed by the
Committee, whilst PwC and Linklaters were
appointed by the Company, and, during the
year , provided consulting services (PwC) and 
legal advice (Linklaters) to the Company. 
The Committee is satisfied that the services
provided to it by PwC and Linklaters were of
a technical nature and did not create any
conflict of interest. If a conflict of interest
were to arise in the future, the Committee
would appoint separate consultants or legal
advisers from those used by the Company.
Activities
During the year the Committee has
discharged its responsibilities by 
reviewing and agreeing:
  performance targets for the year and
progress against those targets;
  policy for executive share scheme grants
including the level of individual grants 
and performance conditions;
  policy for the operation of the all-employee
share schemes;
  the award of bonuses based on the prior
year' s performance;
  the basis for the annual review of
executive directors' remuneration,
including the composition of the
comparator groups;
  the levels and structure of remuneration
payable to senior executives;
  the discretionary elements 
of the executive share plans; and
  pension arrangements for senior
executives in the light of forthcoming 
tax changes.
In addition, the Committee has:
  reviewed the remuneration report; and
  consulted with major shareholders 
over changes to remuneration policy.
The Committee' s remuneration strategy 
is to provide a remuneration package that:
  helps attract, retain and motivate the
highest calibre executives;
  is aligned to shareholders' interests 
to create sustainable long-term
shareholder value;
  is competitive against the appropriate
market, providing median reward for
median performance and upper quartile
reward for upper quartile performance;
  encourages and supports a high
performance culture whilst providing 
a balance between fixed and 
variable reward; and
  is fair and transparent and can be applied
consistently throughout the Group.
Details of executive remuneration are set
out on pages 59 to 74 of this Remuneration
report and include on pages 59 and 60
the outcome of consultations with major
shareholders in respect of changes 
to executive remuneration policy for 2006
and beyond.

Governance
The Non-Executive Directors' Fees
Committee was formed by the Board in
January 2005 with authority on its behalf 
to agree fees payable to non-executive
directors. This role was undertaken
previously by the Board as a whole. The 
full terms of reference of the Non-Executive
Directors' Fees Committee can be found on
the Company' s website or can be obtained
from the Company Secretary.
Activities
The Board has approved the following
guidelines to be used by the Committee
when discharging its responsibilities:
  fees shall be sufficient to attract and
retain individuals with the necessary
skills, experience and knowledge 
required to ensure that the Board is 
able to discharge its duties effectively;
  in setting fees the Committee shall have
regard to the amount of time individual
non-executive directors are required to
devote to their duties and also the scale,
complexity and international nature of the
business and the responsibility involved;
  fees payable to non-executive directors
shall be paid in cash and shall not be
performance related; and
  non-executive directors shall not
participate in the Company' s share-based
incentive schemes or pension scheme.
In 2005 the Committee held one meeting,
attended by all members, at which it agreed
the structure of non-executive directors'
fees detailed on page 73 of this report.

Remuneration reporting
Executive remuneration review
This section of the report explains the
outcome of the formal remuneration review
undertaken in 2005 and the subsequent
consultation with major shareholders, and
the changes to future remuneration policy
resulting from this process.
As reported in last year' s Remuneration
Report, the Remuneration Committee (the
Committee) undertook a formal review of
executive remuneration policy in the second
half of 2005 and, having formulated its
proposals, subsequently undertook a
consultation with major shareholders 
at the beginning of 2006 in respect of:
  an enhancement to the Chief Executive' s
package reflecting his performance whilst
maintaining a median benchmark position;
  the settling of share-based awards for
senior US executives in shares rather
than cash, and introduction of a new cash-
based long-term incentive plan for less
senior executives globally to replace
share options and performance shares
(and their cash equivalents in the US);
  the replacement of the Restricted Share
Plan with a new Share Matching Plan
(subject to formal shareholder approval 
in May 2006), including the introduction 
of a performance condition on 
matching shares;
  the replacement of the Performance
Share Plan (subject to formal shareholder
approval in May 2006) with a similar plan
which incorporates changes in relation to
the calculation of the maximum award,
flexibility to use new issue shares and,
for executives below Board level, the
flexibility to base part of the award on
internal measures rather than on T otal
Shareholder Return; and
  arrangements to provide senior executives
with choices to deal with the new tax rules
on pensions being introduced in April
2006, without increasing the Company' s
costs and without compensating senior
executives for any additional tax they may
have to pay.
As a result of this process, a number of
changes have been made to remuneration
policy which are detailed below:
(i) Chief Executive's remuneration
The Committee concluded from the
remuneration review that the remuneration
structure for the executive directors
remained appropriate and generally in line
with the market, provided a good mix of
short and long-term incentives, cash and
share-based rewards, and aligned the
interests of the executive directors with
those of shareholders.
The exception was the remuneration of the
Chief Executive, whose salary was shown 
to be below market and for whom the bonus
potential and long-term incentives were
significantly below market. Given the 
Chief Executive' s time in the role, his
performance and the performance of the
Group, the Committee agreed the following
improvements to the Chief Executive' s
package for 2006:
  Base salary: increased to  870,000 
with effect from 1 January 2006;
  Bonus potential: increased to 150% 
of base salary but with one-third of his
bonus to be compulsorily deferred into 
the new Share Matching Plan; and
  Long-term incentives: a 50% increase 
in the annual awards of share options 
and performance shares to 225% of 
base salary in share options and 150% 
of base salary in performance shares.
These increases in annual awards will 
give a total combined expected value 
of long-term incentives (including the 
new Share Matching Plan) of around
150% of base salary.
These enhancements will position the 
Chief Executive' s overall reward package 
in line with the market median. (ii) Share Matching Plan (SMP)
The current Restricted Share Plan 
(a description of which appears on page 
63 of this report) will be replaced by a 
new Share Matching Plan, subject to
shareholder approval at the 2006 AGM,
and will incorporate the following changes:
  the SMP will be structured as a stand-alone
share investment plan with the maximum
investment linked to the amount of annual
bonus awarded;
  the Matching Shares will be subject to 
a performance condition which will be
aligned with the performance condition 
for share options which is based on the
real growth in earnings per share (the
performance condition for share options
is described in more detail on pages 
62 and 63);
  the maximum matching ratio of Matching
Shares to Bonus Shares (i.e. shares
purchased by the individual participant)
will be retained at 1:1 but will be linked 
to the gross amount invested;
  the Matching Shares will attract dividends
during the three year deferral period which
will be released at the same time as the
Matching Shares;
  for executives who leave on grounds 
of retirement, redundancy or ill-health,
or where the Company is subject to a
change of control, the Matching Shares
will be pro-rated for the length of time 
the individual has been employed during
the performance period and will remain
subject to the performance condition
unless the Committee decide that that
would be inappropriate; and
  the Committee will have the flexibility 
to use new issue shares within the
existing dilution limits as well as 
market purchase shares to satisfy 
the award of Matching Shares.
(iii) Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The Performance Share Plan (a description
of which appears on page 63 of this report)
was originally approved by shareholders 
in 1996. A similar plan will be put to the
shareholders for approval at the AGM in
2006 to replace the current plan. The new
plan will retain a vesting level at 25% of the
initial award for median performance but 
will incorporate the following changes:
  the maximum award level is to be
changed from 100% of total remuneration
(i.e. salary, bonus and other cash
allowances) to 200% of base salary. 
This will allow the Committee to make 
the anticipated awards for the Chief
Executive (as set out on page 59) without
having to take account of bonuses and 
will also give the Committee flexibility to
make - in exceptional circumstances -
higher awards to other executives who
currently receive awards of up to 100% 
of base salary. The Committee does not
intend to change its grant policy at the
current time, other than for the Chief
Executive, and would consult with
principal shareholders in the usual way 
if it considered this to be necessary;
  the PSP performance measure is to
continue to be based on T otal Shareholder
Return for executive directors. For other
executives, the Committee wishes to have
the flexibility to agree that up to half of any
award could be based on appropriately
stretching internal measures (with the rest
based on T otal Shareholder Return as at
present) to create improved incentive and
alignment with the individual' s own
business performance; and
  the flexibility to use new issue shares
within existing dilution limits is to be
introduced, in addition to using shares
purchased in the market.
(iv) Share-based reward for senior 
US executives
US executives participate in the same 
plans as the non-US executives but, with 
the exception of Mark Ronald, the US 
based Chief Operating Officer , the awards
are currently settled in cash rather than 
shares due to US listing restrictions. 
The Committee has now been advised 
that it can settle awards in shares for those
US senior executives who qualify as
 Accredited Investors' which will enhance
the alignment with shareholders' interests.
T o operate within existing dilution limits,
the remuneration strategy for senior
managers globally below the senior
executive population has been reviewed 
with share-based rewards being replaced 
by a cash-based long-term incentive plan
linked to earnings performance. The
Committee believes that this will promote a
consistent global approach and will derive
enhanced value for money from the
executive reward programmes.
(v) UK Executive pension arrangements
In a separate exercise from the
Remuneration Review, the Committee 
has concluded its review of UK executive
pension arrangements in view of the new 
tax rules which come into effect from April
2006. The new tax rules introduce the
concept of a  Lifetime Allowance', i.e. the
maximum amount of pension savings that
can benefit from tax relief. The Lifetime
Allowance threshold has initially been set 
at  1.5m for 2006. As the Committee' s
approach is not to compensate executives
for changes in taxation, the Committee
believes that it is appropriate to offer
executives choices which are broadly 
cost neutral to the Company but which 
may better suit the needs of executives. 
As such, when an executive' s benefits reach
the new Lifetime Allowance, it has decided
to offer executives the following choices:
  remain in the pension scheme and pay
the additional tax charge; or
  opt out of the pension scheme (and 
so earn no further pension benefits in
respect of future service) and instead
receive a taxable salary supplement. 
This supplement will be 30% of base
salary and 20% of base salary for those
senior executives with a two-thirds salary
target after at least 20 and 30 years'
service respectively; or
  restrict pension scheme benefits to 
the value of the new Lifetime Allowance
with the remainder being provided 
directly by the Company as an unfunded
 promise'. At retirement, the unfunded
company pension can either be taken 
as pension or can be commuted in full 
for a taxable lump sum. The commutation
rates have been calculated to be cost
neutral to the Company.
These arrangements, which the Committee
believes are consistent with current pension
philosophy and in line with market practice,
will apply to all UK executives who reach the
Lifetime Allowance, including the UK
executive directors.
With effect from 6 April 2006, the Company
will accrue at each accounting period for the
amount of unfunded  promise' earned in
that accounting period. The cumulative
unfunded balance will be recorded as 
a liability at the balance sheet date.

have been  15bn. The Committee also
reviewed remuneration data for aerospace
and defence companies within the FTSE 100.
For the US Chief Operating Officer ,
regression analysis was used on US
aerospace, defence and general industry
sector data to produce appropriate 
market figures consistent with the size 
and scale of the US business, adjusting
where necessary to reflect the extra
responsibility for the Board role.
There was no readily available market 
data for the Group Legal Director so the
Committee used the data for the other
executive director roles as a guide to
position his package.
As a result of this review, the Committee
decided to increase the base salary of 
the executive directors with effect from
1 January 2006 to the following:
Mike Turner
Chief Executive  870,000
George Rose
Group Finance Director  530,000
Chris Geoghegan
UK Chief Operating Officer  467,500
Steve Mogford
UK Chief Operating Officer  467,500
Mark Ronald
1
US Chief Operating Officer $1,000,000
Michael Lester
Group Legal Director  567,500

Mark Ronald' s base salary was increased from
$850,000 to $950,000 with effect from 1 July 2005
following the acquisition of United Defense and its
subsequent integration into the Land & Armaments
business group
Annual Bonus Plan
The executive directors and other senior
executives participate in a cash bonus 
plan that rewards those individuals if
predetermined targets are met. The targets 
are derived from the Integrated Business
Plan (IBP), which is agreed by the Board 
and which implements corporate strategy 
on a groupwide basis by ensuring that
business plans which support the strategy
are integrated across all businesses. 
The IBP is used to set the objectives for
senior management including the base and
stretch targets for the financial measures
used for the executive directors in the
Annual Bonus Plan.
At upper quartile performance variable
remuneration represents significantly 
more than 50% of the total package.
The principles of the remuneration 
strategy are applied consistently across 
the Group taking account of seniority 
and local market practice.
Base salary
Executive directors' base salaries are
reviewed each year by the Committee 
and adjusted to reflect performance 
and the competitiveness of salaries 
relative to the market. Information on 
the market for comparable management
positions is obtained from independent
sources and is provided to the Committee
so that it can form a view as to where to
position basic salaries and benefits relative
to comparable companies.
The methodology used is to construct
appropriate comparator groups for the
individual positions taking account of
company size, scale of operations and
breadth of role. The median and upper
quartile positions are then analysed for
base salary, total cash reward (base 
salary plus annual bonus), total direct
reward (total cash reward plus long-term
incentives) and total reward including
pension. This gives the Committee a view 
on the competitiveness of the individual
elements of the package as well as the
package as a whole. The Committee also
reviews the trends in the elements of
remuneration to ensure that the structure 
of the package stays in line with market
practice, and also takes account of the
performance of the individual, the Company
as a whole and the pay and conditions of
Group employees.
For the Chief Executive, Group Finance
Director , and the UK Chief Operating
Officers, a comparator group was
constructed consisting of the 19 FTSE 100
companies (excluding financial institutions)
with turnover closest to BAE Systems (nine
larger and ten smaller). The BAE Systems
turnover figure chosen was  12bn,
representing the full year turnover of the
Group' s wholly owned businesses had
United Defense and Insyte been wholly
owned throughout 2005. If the Committee
had chosen to include the contribution to
turnover from the Group' s equity accounted
investments, the comparative figure would 
Remuneration policy and service contracts
for executive directors 
This section of the report explains the
ongoing remuneration policy for executive
directors, the individual components of their
remuneration and details of their service
contracts, as required by legislation.
The Remuneration Committee' s (the
Committee) executive remuneration policy
continues to be to set base salaries at
median competitive levels whilst seeking 
to reward upper quartile performance with
potential upper quartile remuneration
through the use of bonus schemes and
share-based incentives. The Committee
intends to continue with the executive
remuneration policy as detailed in this
report in 2006 and subsequent years,
and will continue to consult on material
changes with principal shareholders.
Remuneration of executive directors
consists typically of basic salary, a bonus
based on annual performance, participation
in employee share schemes and retirement
benefits. The Committee reviews the split
between basic salary and the performance
related elements of remuneration each year
in order to incentivise properly executive
directors, and believes that a significant
proportion of remuneration should be 
based on schemes that encourage them 
to perform at the highest level. Through 
this arrangement, it is possible for those
individuals who contribute to sustained high
levels of company performance to receive at
least a similar level of reward from variable
compensation to that received from fixed
compensation. At median performance,
variable remuneration represents
approximately 50% of the remuneration
package as shown in the chart below:
Target performance (median)
   Salary 32%
   Pension 20%
  Bonus  16%
   Long-term 
 incentive rewards 32%
The package of the Chief Executive is more 
highly geared with almost 60% of the
remuneration being performance related. Non-financial targets comprise key objectives
relevant to the individual and/or business
and also take account of behavioural
performance. The Executive Committee
(which comprises the executive directors
and certain other senior executives),
takes collective responsibility for the key
non-financial objectives for the group as a
whole, which support the delivery of the IBP
and these are agreed by the Remuneration
Committee. These are then used to set 
the individual targets for the Executive
Committee members and are then
cascaded to the individual business units
enabling detailed targets and milestones 
to be set.
2005 was another very successful year ,
building on the excellent performance in
2004. All the major business groups
achieved their stretch targets on profit 
and cash and, as a result, all the financial
targets within the 2005 Annual Bonus 
Plan for executive directors were met at 
the stretch level. In addition, excellent
progress was made against all the key 
non-financial objectives although more 
work still needs to be done on securing
technology transfer from the US to the UK.
Accordingly, bonus payments for 2005 which
are set out in T able E on page 73 range 
from 95% to 99% of the maximum bonus.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed
and agreed bonus targets for 2006 for the
executive directors and believes that both 
the financial and non-financial targets are
stretching but achievable and are aligned 
to the Group' s overall objectives.
As a result of its annual review of the
performance related part of the
remuneration package, the Committee 
has determined that the maximum bonus
potential for 2006 will remain unchanged
from 2005 at 100% of base salary (150%
for the US-based executive director , Mark
Ronald), with the exception of the maximum
bonus potential for the Chief Executive
which has increased to 150% of base 
salary with at least one-third of the Chief
Executive' s bonus being compulsorily
deferred into the new Share Matching Plan.
In determining the performance measures
for the Annual Bonus Plan, the Committee
took the view that the Company' s major
investors believed earnings per share (EPS)
and cash targets (and, where appropriate,
EBITA), to be key indicators of long-term
financial performance and value creation.
These, coupled with the non-financial
measures, align the executive directors'
objectives with corporate strategy and
targeted business performance.
The EPS figure used for the bonus plan (and
the Executive Share Option Plan) is based
on underlying EPS and may be adjusted if
necessary to ensure that the figures for
individual years are broadly comparable.
Share option schemes and long-term
incentive schemes
The Committee seeks to align the interests
of executive directors with those of other
shareholders through the use of share-
based incentive schemes. The Company
operates a combination of option and 
share-based awards for executive directors
within the framework detailed below. This 
is broadly in line with similar plans operated
by other FTSE 100 companies.
Performance conditions for grants of 
options or awards to be made under the
Executive Share Option Plan and the
Performance Share Plan in 2006 are set 
out below. Performance conditions for
earlier grants under the Executive Share
Option Plan are shown as notes to T able C
on page 69. Performance conditions for
grants of awards under the Performance
Share Plan made between 2003 and 2005
are the same as for awards to be made in
2006 as detailed overleaf.
Executive Share Option Plan
Options granted under the Executive Share
Option Plan are normally exercisable
between the third and tenth anniversary of
their grant. Options may only be exercised
during this period as follows:
  33.33% of each option grant is
exercisable if the Company achieves 
on average real EPS growth per annum 
of 3% but less than 4% over the three 
year performance period;
  66.67% of each option grant is
exercisable if the Company achieves 
on average real EPS growth per annum 
of 4% but less than 5% over the three 
year performance period; and
  100% of each option grant is exercisable
if the Company achieves on average real
EPS growth per annum of 5% or more 
over the three year performance period.
The structure of the Annual Bonus Plan for executive directors in 2006 (expressed as
percentages of base salary) is as follows:
Corporate roles

A sectoral peer group will continue to be
used in 2006 as the principal performance
measure due to its importance to the
Company' s shareholders as an indication 
of both earnings and capital growth 
relative to major global defence and
aerospace companies. A relative measure 
is considered important as it rewards
management if they outperform against
major companies in the sector rather 
than success possibly being determined
solely by growth in stock markets. The
second measure was included to ensure
that awards will only vest if there has been 
a clear improvement in the Company' s
underlying performance over the 
relevant period.
The composition of the TSR sectoral peer
group will not change for awards to be made
in 2006. It comprises:

Restricted Share Plan
The Restricted Share Plan (RSP) has
historically acted as a share based
extension of the Annual Bonus Plan in that
executive directors who participate in the
annual bonus scheme may be given the
option of taking any net cash bonus paid
partly or wholly in shares through the RSP . 
If an election is made to take shares through 
the RSP , they are held in trust for a period 
of three years after which the Company
awards the individual an equal number of
shares (the  Matching Shares') provided 
the individual normally remains in the
Company' s employment at the vesting date.
Where executive directors have elected to
use such bonuses through the RSP , details
of the shares held are set out in T able B on
page 69.
The matching award of shares has not in 
the past been subject to any performance
criteria as the RSP was designed to retain
key staff and to encourage executives to 
re-invest in company shares the cash
bonuses that they had earned under the
bonus plan, which was itself based on
performance criteria.
The RSP will operate in the way set out
above in 2006 in respect of 2005 bonuses
but, subject to shareholder approval at the
2006 AGM, will be replaced by a new Share
Matching Plan which will operate from 2007
as a stand-alone investment plan with
performance conditions attached to the
Matching Shares. Further information on
these changes are set out on page 60 of
this report.
Share Incentive Plan
During 2005 the UK executive directors
were eligible to participate in the all-
employee free shares element of the 
Share Incentive Plan. As a result of the
Company' s performance in 2005, all 
eligible employees (including the UK
executive directors) will be entitled to
receive shares worth  418. A similar
arrangement operates for eligible non-UK
employees on a cash or shares basis
depending on local tax and security laws. 
In 2005 the Company introduced a 
share purchase arrangement (Partnership
Shares) under the Share Incentive Plan
which replaced the SAYE Share Option
Scheme. Under this arrangement, UK 
based employees (including executive
directors) may purchase ordinary shares 
in BAE Systems by either monthly
investments of between  10 and  125 
a month, or lump sum investments of
between  10 and  1,500 in a tax year ,
both limited to 10% of salary if less.
Dividends paid in respect of the shares 
in the Share Incentive Plan for UK 
based employees are reinvested as
Dividend Shares.
In determining the performance measure 
for the Executive Share Option Plan, the
Committee took the view that the
Company' s major investors believed EPS 
to be a key indicator of long-term financial
performance and value creation.
Option grants under the Executive Share
Option Plan in 2006 will be set at a maximum
of 1.5 x base salary (2.25 x base salary 
for the Chief Executive). There will be no
retesting after the three year performance
period for options to be granted in 2006.
Performance Share Plan
Conditional awards of shares are made
under the Performance Share Plan which 
are contingent on meeting predetermined
performance criteria. Awards in 2006 to
executive directors will be granted at a value
equal to 1 x base salary (1.5 x base salary
for the Chief Executive). The proportion 
of the award which is capable of exercise 
is determined by the Company' s T otal
Shareholder Return (share price growth plus
dividends) ranking relative to a comparator
group of 18 other defence and aerospace
companies operating internationally, and 
by a secondary financial measure.
Performance for the 2006 award will be
measured as follows:
(i) Total shareholder return (TSR)
100% of the conditional shares are awarded
to directors if the Company' s TSR over a
three year period is in the top 20% of TSRs
achieved by the sectoral comparator group,
with 25% vesting if the TSR is in the top
50%. Intermediate positions will be
calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis.
No awards will be made if the Company' s
performance is outside the top 50%. Awards
will be made in three equal instalments at
the end of years three, four and five.
(ii) Underlying financial performance
As a secondary measure the Committee 
will consider whether there has been a
sustained improvement in the Company' s
underlying financial performance and
whether it is appropriate to release some 
or all of the awards. In taking a view of a
sustained improvement in underlying
financial performance, the Committee 
may consider (but not exclusively) the
following financial metrics: net debt/cash;
EBITA; order book; turnover; risk and
underlying project performance. Impact of International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS)
The Committee has reviewed the impact of
the changes in the accounting standard
from UK GAAP to IFRS on the performance
targets and all bonus targets for 2005 were
restated onto an IFRS basis.
The Committee has also reviewed the
impact on EPS figures used for setting 
the performance condition for the share
option plans to ensure that the EPS figures
for comparative years are measured on 
a consistent basis. The Committee has
agreed to adjust the EPS figures for 2003
and before by increasing them by 2.3%,
this being the impact of moving from UK
GAAP to IFRS on the 2004 EPS. As a 
result of this change, it is anticipated 
that it will be no less difficult to achieve 
any of the performance conditions relating
to outstanding options still subject to
performance conditions.
Dilution of share capital
The Committee has agreed that, in 
respect of new issue or treasury shares,
shares representing no more than 1% of 
the Company' s issued share capital will 
be used in any one financial year for the
grant of options under all employee share
schemes. The table below sets out the
available dilution capacity for the Company' s
employee share schemes based on the
limits set out in the rules of those schemes.

Personal shareholding policy
The Committee has agreed a policy 
whereby all executive directors are required
to establish and maintain a minimum 
personal shareholding equal to 200% 
of base salary. As a minimum a holding
equal to 100% of base salary must be
achieved as quickly as possible using
shares vesting or options exercised 
through the executive share option 
schemes or long-term incentive schemes,
by using 50% of the shares that vest or 50%
of the options which are exercised on each
occasion. Thereafter executive directors 
are required to increase their personal
shareholding gradually, on each occasion
using 25% of the shares that vest or 25% 
of the options exercised each year , until a
personal shareholding equal to 200% of
annual salary is achieved and maintained. 
These limits are reviewed periodically.
Details of the directors' personal
shareholdings are shown in T able A 
on page 68. BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 65
Under the rules of the relevant scheme,
Michael Lester commenced his pension in
2002 having reached normal retirement
age. He has not accrued further benefits
since retiring other than pension increases
awarded to all pensioner members of his
pension scheme.
UK pension benefits - arrangements
coming into force from 6 April 2006:
The Company has been in consultation 
with UK employee representatives and
National T rade Union Officials to address its
UK pension scheme deficits and proposals
are being put to the trustees of the Main 
Pension Scheme following the support
shown by a recent T rade Union Consultative
ballot and a survey carried out by the
Company on measures to be taken in
respect of the Main Pension Scheme. 
These measures include changes to
benefits in respect of future service 
accrual. All changes, which at the date of
this report remain subject to approval by 
the trustees of the Main Pension Scheme,
will apply to the pension arrangements 
of the executive directors who are active
members of that scheme (i.e. each of the 
UK based executive directors except
Michael Lester). Consultations with
employee representatives and National
T rade Union Officials are continuing in
respect of the resolution of deficit issues 
in relation to the other UK pension schemes
(including that of which Michael Lester is a
pensioner member).
As set out on page 60, the Committee 
has agreed its approach to UK executive
pension arrangements in the light of 
the new tax rules which come into effect
from April 2006. These arrangements 
will apply to all UK executives who reach 
the Lifetime Allowance, including the 
UK executive directors.
As explained above and in the notes to 
T able F on page 74, George Rose' s
unapproved pension arrangement is partly
funded and partly unfunded. As a result of
the tax changes coming into force on 6 April
2006, all benefits in respect of service after
April 2006 can be paid from the approved
schemes without reference to an earnings
cap. The Company' s treatment of individuals
in this position (including George Rose) will
be to make a one-off contribution (where
necessary) to the unapproved arrangement
to fund it fully to a target level for service up
to April 2006. By agreement with the
Post-retirement benefits
The executive directors of the Company are
members of Group pension schemes and
have a normal retirement age of 60, except
Michael Lester and Mark Ronald who had
normal retirement ages of 62 and are
already in receipt of their pensions.
UK pension benefits -
current arrangements
The pension schemes for the UK based
directors are designed to produce a target
pension of two-thirds of final pensionable
earnings if potential service is 20 or more
years. Final pensionable earnings is basic
salary averaged over the last 12 months
prior to leaving service. Pensions can be
paid before normal retirement age, subject
to the consent of the Company and the
pension scheme trustees. These schemes
also provide a lump sum death benefit equal
to four times basic salary at date of death,
and a spouse' s pension equal to two-thirds
of the prospective pension at normal
retirement age or , once retired, of the actual
pension in payment (before any lump sum
commutation). Children' s allowances are
also payable, usually up to the age of 18,
upon death in service or death in retirement.
If directors leave the Company' s
employment with a deferred pension and die
after age 50 but before the pension has
commenced, a lump sum benefit is paid
equal to five times the annual rate of
pension that would have been paid had the
deferred pension commenced immediately
before date of death. If a director dies with a
deferred pension before age 50, a refund of
his contributions will be paid and a pension
will be paid to his legal spouse in line with
the rules of the scheme for all employees.
Pensions are increased annually by the 
rise in the Retail Prices Index subject to a
maximum increase of 5% per year . Directors
pay contributions at the same rate as all
other employees participating in schemes.
Of the executive directors, George Rose is
affected by the HM Revenue and Customs
(HMRC) earnings cap on approved pensions
and has an unapproved (i.e. non-tax qualified)
pension arrangement to top up his benefits
from the approved scheme. This is designed
so that the total pension from all sources
will be broadly in line with the pension he
would have received from the Group pension
schemes had he not been subject to the
earnings cap. Further information paid by the
Company in respect of these arrangements
is included in the notes to T able F on page 74.
affected individuals, the Company will then
cease to make any further contributions to
the unapproved arrangement. The
individuals affected will be given the option,
if they so wish, to transfer their unapproved
arrangement into the approved schemes
after April 2006 so that the approved
schemes provide the benefits in respect of all
their service based on uncapped earnings.
US pension benefits
Mark Ronald is covered by the Company' s
US pension arrangements and the non-
qualified supplemental arrangements in
place under his contract. He commenced
his non-qualified pension in 2004 having
reached his normal retirement age. 
This forms the majority of his entitlement.
His remaining entitlement from the 
qualified plan will commence when he
leaves service. In line with the rules of the
US arrangements, it is not envisaged that
the pensions will be increased once in
payment. Death benefits under the plans
are provided by a pension continuation to
his spouse or dependants in accordance
with specific payments from each scheme.
Details of post-retirement benefits for each
of the executive directors are shown in
T able F on page 74 and are calculated 
in accordance with the requirements of
Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
Other benefits
Other benefits provided to the executive
directors include a car allowance, cash
allowance for medical examination and,
where appropriate, second residence
support allowance. As previously reported,
having recognised the need for the Chief
Executive to spend a substantial amount 
of time in central London on Company
business, the Committee agreed to make 
a second residence support allowance 
to Mike T urner in line with group policy 
and the final payment of  25,000 of 
this allowance was made in 2005 
(2004  25,000). Executive directors' service contracts
It is the Committee' s policy that executive directors should normally have service contracts
that provide for the Company to give the individual 12 months' notice of termination. This
policy has been chosen because it provides a reasonable balance between the need to
retain the services of key individuals and the need to limit the liabilities of the Company in
the event of the termination of a contract. The executive directors have service contracts
with group companies; details of these contracts are as follows:

Chris Geoghegan 10 July 2002 12 months 12 months either party

15 January 2004 and 14 October 2005)
*as at 22 February 2006
In the event of the termination of an
executive director' s contract it is the
Committee' s policy to seek to limit any
payment made in lieu of notice to a 
payment equal to the amount of one year' s
basic salary. The service contracts for all 
of the executive directors contain specific
provisions to the effect that the Company
has the right to pay a sum equivalent to 
12 months' salary in the event of the
Company terminating their contracts for
reasons other than gross misconduct. 
No executive director has provisions 
in his service contract that relate to 
a change of control of the Company (and
neither does the Chairman nor the non-
executive directors in their respective 
letters of appointment). Under the terms 
of his contract Mark Ronald is entitled 
to compensation of a lump sum equal to
12 months' salary, and the continuance 
of medical benefits for 18 months, if his
contract is terminated by BAE Systems, Inc.,
his directorship of the parent company
ceases, or his contract is not renewed 
at the end of its rolling one-year term.
Policy on external board appointments
The long-standing policy of allowing
executive directors to hold external 
non-BAE Systems related non-executive
directorships with the prior approval of the
Committee will continue. The Committee
considers that external directorships
provide the Company' s senior executives
with valuable experience that is of benefit 
to BAE Systems. It is also considered
appropriate for BAE Systems, as a FTSE 100
company, to contribute to the pool of non-
executive expertise available for the benefit
of the wider business community, thereby
reciprocating the benefit which it in turn 
has received from other organisations 
which have permitted members of their
senior management teams to serve in a
non-executive capacity on the BAE Systems
Board. The Committee believes that it is
reasonable for the individual executive
director to retain any fees received from
such non-executive appointments given the
additional personal responsibility that this
entails. Such fees retained by the executive
directors in 2005 were as follows:
Michael Lester:  33,000; George Rose:
 63,125; and Mike T urner:  30,250.

Chairman's appointment, term and fees
Dick Olver was appointed Chairman on
1 July 2004. His appointment is for an 
initial fixed three year term with effect 
from 17 May 2004 (the date that he was
appointed to the Board as a non-executive
director) and is documented in a letter of
appointment which is not a contract of
employment. He is required to devote no
fewer than two days a week to his duties 
as Chairman, unless terminated earlier 
in accordance with the Company' s Articles 
of Association, or by either party giving the
other not less than six months' prior written
notice. The Nominations Committee will
review his appointment prior to the end of
the three year term and will, if appropriate
(and subject to the agreement of Mr Olver),
recommend to the Board that he be invited
to serve for an additional period. His
appointment as Chairman will automatically
terminate if he ceases to be a director of the
Company. His fee, which has been set by the
Remuneration Committee at  500,000 per
annum, will not be subject to review during
the initial three year term.
Non-executive directors are normally
appointed for two consecutive three year
terms subject to review after the end of the
first three year period and with any third
term of three years being subject to rigorous
review and taking into account the need
progressively to refresh the Board. They do
not have periods of notice and the Company
has no obligation to pay compensation when
their appointment terminates. They are
subject to re-election at the AGM following
their appointment and subsequently at
intervals of no more than three years.
Lord Hesketh retired from the Board 
at the conclusion of the 2005 AGM 
on 4 May 2005, having originally been
appointed to the Board on 1 January 1994.
The letters of appointment for non-executive
directors detail the amount of time it is
anticipated that the individual will need 
to devote to his or her duties as a director . 
Non-executive directors are proposed by the
Nominations Committee and are appointed
by the Board on the basis of their experience
to provide independent judgement on issues
of strategy, performance, resources and
standards of conduct. The level of their fees
is set after reviewing practice in other
comparable companies.
Fees payable to non-executive directors are
agreed by the Non-Executive Directors' Fees
Committee. Non-executive directors are
paid a fee reflecting the time commitment
required of the director . The fee level for 
the chairmen of the Audit, Corporate
Responsibility and Remuneration
Committees, and for the Senior 
Independent Director , reflects their
additional responsibilities and workload.
Details of the non-executive directors' fees
in 2005 are shown in T able E on page 73.
The fees payable to the non-executive
directors were reviewed in January 2006 and
the following fee structure was agreed for
2006 to reflect the various responsibilities
of the individual directors: a fee of  70,000
for the chairman of the Audit Committee; a
fee of  65,000 for each of the chairman of
the Remuneration Committee, the chairman
of the Corporate Responsibility Committee,
and the Senior Independent Director; and 
a fee of  50,000 for each of the other 
non-executive directors. In addition, a
transatlantic meeting allowance of  4,000
will continue to be payable to non-executive
directors: this takes into account the
additional time commitment required by 
the European based non-executive directors
to attend board meetings in the US and
similarly the commitment of US based 
non-executive directors to attend board
meetings in Europe.

The BAE Systems Executive Share Option Plan has been used to grant options to the executive directors since 2001. The performance conditions applying to the grants of options
made in 2001-2004 are the same as for grants to be made in 2006, as set out on page 62 of this report, with the exception of the re-testing provision: for grants made between 
2001-2003, where the original three year performance is not met, performance is re-tested at the end of years four and five against the full period from grant; for grants made in
2004, where the original performance target is not met, performance is re-tested at the end of year five against the full period from grant. In all these cases the option will lapse 
in year five if the targets have not been achieved. The performance conditions applying to the grants of options made in 2005 are the same as for grants to be made in 2006,
as set out on page 62 of this report; there is no re-testing of performance for grants made in 2005 and beyond.
On completion of the BAE/MES merger in 1999, options were granted to executive directors under the predecessor Executive Share Option Scheme. Options granted to Michael
Lester and Mark Ronald in 1999 can only be exercised if the pre-exceptional EPS for any three-year period exceeded the sum of inflation for that period and a real growth requirement
of 9% is achieved. Options granted to the other executive directors in 1999 (which partially vested in 2004 as reported last year) were conditional on the satisfaction of a special
performance condition based on the achievement of cost savings of the merger integration process over the three-year performance period commencing on 1 January 2000.
A breakdown of options held by executive directors under the Executive Share Option Plan is given overleaf. The breakdown of the options held by executive directors under the Executive Share Option Plan is as follows:

calculation of cash equivalents from the Group' s UK pension schemes. With effective from 2005, the actuary has changed the assumptions used to calculate cash equivalents
from the UK pension schemes and they are no longer subject to a minimum of the statutory Minimum Funding Requirement basis. This change is in accordance with the latest
GN11. The amount of the increase in transfer value arising from the change in assumptions is: Chris Geoghegan  109,264; Steve Mogford  80,193; George Rose  132,674;
Mike T urner  420,990.

George Rose' s unapproved retirement arrangement is partly funded and partly unfunded. The Company' s pension contribution to the funded unapproved retirement arrangement
for George Rose in 2005 was  569,378 (2004  515,089). Of this amount, approximately  377,328 (2004  339,000) relates to the cost of benefits accruing during the year
and approximately  192,000 (2004  176,000) relates to dealing with investment under-performance prior to 2003. In 2003, the Company decided to deal with the under-
performance of the underlying investments over a three-year period, 2003-2005; the third of these payments was made during 2005. This treatment reflects company policy for
employees with unapproved arrangements in the same position.
