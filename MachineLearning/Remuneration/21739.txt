Committee report
- Remuneration reporting
- Remuneration policy and service
contracts for executive directors
- Chairman's appointment, term and fees

and share-based incentives
Remuneration Committee Report
Responsibilities
The Board has delegated the following
responsibilities to the Remuneration
Committee:
- Agreeing a policy for the remuneration
of the Chairman and executive directors.
- Within the agreed policy, determining
individual remuneration packages for 
the Chairman and executive directors.
- Agreeing the terms and conditions to 
be included in service agreements for
executive directors.
- Approving any employee share-based
incentive schemes and any performance
conditions to be used for such schemes.
- Determining any share scheme
performance targets. 
The full terms of reference of the
Remuneration Committee, which conform
with the requirements of the Combined
Code, can be found on the Company's
website or can be obtained from the
Company Secretary.
Governance
The Committee is chaired by Professor 
Sue Birley and all of its members are
independent non-executive directors. The
Company's Chairman and Chief Executive
attend committee meetings by invitation only.
They do not attend where their individual
remuneration is discussed and no director 
is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
In 2006 the Committee met seven times and
details of attendance at these meetings are
provided in the Corporate Governance Report
on page 46.
During the year Dick Olver and Mike Turner, in
their respective capacities as Chairman and
Chief Executive, provided advice that was of
material assistance to the Committee. The
Committee also received material assistance
and advice on remuneration policy from the
Company's Group Human Resources Director,
Alastair Imrie, and from the Human
Resources Director, Remuneration and
Benefits, Graham Middleton. In addition, the
Committee received advice and services
from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in
respect of the design and competitive
positioning of senior executive remuneration
(including a review of the share plan
performance conditions) and senior executive
pension arrangements; from New Bridge
Street Consultants (NBSC) in respect of the
operation of share plans and the new share
plans approved by shareholders in 2006;
and from Linklaters in respect of legal
advice. NBSC was appointed by the
Committee, whilst PwC and Linklaters were
appointed by the Company and, during the
year, provided consulting services (PwC) and
legal services (Linklaters) to the Company.
The Committee is satisfied that the services
provided to it by PwC and Linklaters were of
a technical nature and did not create any
conflict of interest. If a conflict of interest
were to arise in the future, the Committee
would appoint separate consultants or legal
advisers from those used by the Company. 
Activities
During the year the Committee has
discharged its responsibilities by reviewing
and agreeing:
- performance targets for the year and
progress against those targets;
- the operation of the long-term incentive
plans and policy for executive share scheme
grants including the level of individual grants
and performance conditions;
- policy for the operation of the all-employee
share schemes;
- the award of bonuses based on the prior
year's performance;
- the basis for the annual review of executive
directors' remuneration, including the
composition of the comparator groups 
and the positioning of the remuneration
packages for the two new incoming 
Chief Operating Officers;

Remuneration report (continued)
Remuneration report
Remuneration policy and service contracts
for executive directors 
This section of the report explains the
ongoing remuneration policy for executive
directors, the individual components of their
remuneration and details of their service
contracts, as required by legislation.
The Remuneration Committee's (the
Committee) executive remuneration policy
continues to be to set basic salaries at median
competitive levels whilst seeking to reward
upper quartile performance with potential
upper quartile remuneration through the use 
of bonus schemes and share-based incentives.
The Committee intends to continue with the
executive remuneration policy as detailed in
this report in 2007 and subsequent years, 
and will continue to consult on material
changes with principal shareholders.
Remuneration of executive directors consists
typically of basic salary, a bonus based 
on annual performance, participation in
employee share schemes and retirement
benefits. The Committee reviews the split
between basic salary and the performance-
related elements of remuneration each year
in order to incentivise properly executive
directors, and believes that a significant
proportion of remuneration should be 
based on schemes that encourage them 
to perform at the highest level. Through 
this arrangement, it is possible for those
individuals who contribute to sustained high
levels of company performance to receive at
least a similar level of reward from variable
compensation to that received from fixed
compensation. At median performance,
variable remuneration represents
approximately 50% of the remuneration
package as shown in the chart below:
The package of the Chief Executive is more highly
geared with almost 60% of the remuneration being
performance related.
At upper quartile performance variable
remuneration represents significantly more
than 50% of the total package.
The principles of the remuneration strategy
are applied consistently across the Group
taking account of seniority and local 
market practice. 
Target Performance (median)
Salary 34%
Pension 17%
Bonus 17%
Long-term
incentive rewards 32%
Non-Executive Directors' Fees 
Committee Report
Responsibilities
- Reviewing the fees payable to non-
executive directors (excluding the
Chairman) and making changes to 
such fees as deemed appropriate.
Governance
The Non-Executive Directors' Fees Committee
has delegated authority from the Board to
agree fees payable to non-executive directors
on its behalf. During the year Michael Lester
and Mark Ronald also served as members 
of this Committee until their retirement from
the Board on 31 December 2006. Walt
Havenstein and the Group Legal Director,
Philip Bramwell, joined the Committee in
January 2007.
Activities
The Board has approved the following
guidelines to be used by the Committee
when discharging its responsibilities:
- fees shall be sufficient to attract and 
retain individuals with the necessary skills,
experience and knowledge required to
ensure that the Board is able to discharge
its duties effectively;
- in setting fees the Committee shall have
regard to the amount of time individual non-
executive directors are required to devote 
to their duties and also the scale and
complexity and international nature of the
business and the responsibility involved;
- fees payable to non-executive directors
shall be paid in cash and shall not be
performance related; and
- non-executive directors shall not participate
in the Company's share-based incentive
schemes or pension scheme.
In 2006 the Committee held one meeting,
attended by all members, at which it agreed
the structure of non-executive directors' fees
detailed on page 64 of this report.
Dick Olver
Chairman of the Non-Executive Directors'
Fees Committee
21 February 2007
- the levels and structure of remuneration
payable to senior executives;
- the discretionary elements of the executive
share plans; and 
- pension arrangements for senior executives. 
In addition, the Committee has:
- reviewed the Remuneration Report; and
- consulted with major shareholders over
aspects of remuneration policy.
The Committee's remuneration strategy 
is to provide a remuneration package that:  
- helps attract, retain and motivate the
highest calibre executives;
- is aligned to shareholders' interests 
to create sustainable long-term 
shareholder value;
- is competitive against the appropriate
market, providing median reward for
median performance and upper quartile
reward for upper quartile performance;
- encourages and supports a high
performance culture whilst providing 
a balance between fixed and variable
reward; and
- is fair and transparent and can be applied
consistently throughout the Group. 
Details of executive remuneration are 
set out on pages 52 to 65 of this
Remuneration Report.

Base salary 
Executive directors' base salaries are
reviewed each year by the Committee and
adjusted to reflect performance and the
competitiveness of salaries relative to 
the market. Information on the market 
for comparable management positions is
obtained from independent sources and 
is provided to the Committee so that it 
can form a view as to where to position
basic salaries and benefits relative to 
comparable companies.
The methodology used is to construct
appropriate comparator groups for the
individual positions taking account of
company size, scale of operations and
breadth of role. The median and upper
quartile positions are then analysed for 
base salary, total cash reward (base salary
plus annual bonus), total direct reward (total
cash reward plus long-term incentives) and
total reward including pension. This gives
the Committee a view on the competitiveness
of the individual elements of the package 
as well as the package as a whole. The
Committee also reviews the trends in the
elements of remuneration to ensure that the
structure of the package stays in line with
market practice, and also takes account 
of the performance of the individual, the
Company as a whole and the pay and
conditions of Group employees.
A number of changes were made to the
Company's executive management structure
towards the end of 2006 to reflect the
evolving nature of the organisation and this
impacted on the way in which the base salary
structure for the executive directors has been
determined for 2007.
For the Chief Executive and Group Finance
Director a comparator group was constructed
consisting of the 19 FTSE 50 companies
(excluding financial institutions) with turnover
closest to BAE Systems (nine larger and ten
smaller), the turnover figure for BAE Systems
being  12bn which excludes turnover from
joint ventures. The Committee also reviewed
remuneration data for aerospace and
defence companies within the FTSE 100. 
For the incoming Chief Operating Officer, 
UK and RoW, as there were no similar 
sized roles in the comparator group, the
Committee benchmarked this new role using
regression analysis for main board directors
of UK companies with responsibility for an
international portfolio of businesses that
have a turnover of  6bn. 
Following the change in roles for the two
Group Executive Directors, the Committee
reviewed data relating to the expected salary
trends for FTSE 50 directors in 2007 and,
taking account of their performance and
contribution, awarded a salary increase 
in line with the expected trend.
For the incoming US Chief Operating Officer,
regression analysis was used on US
aerospace, defence and general industry
sector data to produce appropriate market
figures consistent with the size and scale of
the US business, adjusting where necessary
to reflect the extra responsibility for the plc
board role. The remuneration package of the
new appointee was positioned competitively,
but materially below that of the retiring US
Chief Operating Officer in recognition of the
fact that the incoming US Chief Operating
Officer is new to the role. In view of the
requirement for the role to be based in the
Washington DC area, the package includes
relocation expenses in line with the
Company's standard US policy.
As a result of this review, the Committee
determined the base salaries of the executive
directors with effect from January 2007 to 
be as follows:
Mike Turner  945,000
Chief Executive
George Rose  560,000

Annual Bonus Plan
The executive directors and other senior
executives participate in a cash bonus 
plan that rewards those individuals if pre-
determined targets are met. The targets 
are derived from the Integrated Business
Plan (IBP), which is agreed by the Board and
which implements corporate strategy on a
groupwide basis by ensuring that business
plans which support the strategy are
integrated across all businesses. The IBP 
is used to set the objectives for senior
management including the base and stretch
targets for the financial measures used 
for the executive directors in the Annual 
Bonus Plan.
The setting of non-financial targets is
initiated by the Chairman of the Board who,
after consultation with the Chief Executive,
discusses the matter with the Committee.
The Committee approves the Chief
Executive's objectives and those for the
Executive Committee as a whole. The Chief
Executive then makes proposals to the
Committee regarding individual non-financial
objectives for each of the executive directors
and the other members of the Executive
Committee for approval by the Committee.
2006 was another very successful year,
building on the excellent performances in
2004 and 2005. All the major business
groupings achieved their stretch targets 
on profit and cash and, as a result, all the
financial targets within the 2006 Annual
Bonus Plan for executive directors were met
at the stretch level. In addition, excellent
progress was made against all the key non-
financial objectives and, accordingly, bonus
payments for 2006 which are set out in
Table E on page 64 range from 95% to 
100% of the maximum bonus.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed
and agreed bonus targets for 2007 for the
executive directors and believes that both
the financial and non-financial targets are
stretching but achievable and are aligned 
to the Group's overall objectives.
As a result of its annual review of the
performance related part of the remuneration
The structure of the Annual Bonus Plan for executive directors in 2007 (expressed as
percentages of base salary) is as follows:
Corporate roles
Base Stretch Base Stretch
Bonus element target target target target
EPS targets 28.125% 56.25% 18.75% 37.5%

Remuneration report
package, the Committee has determined that
the maximum bonus potential for 2007 will
remain unchanged from 2006 at 100% of
base salary (150% for the US-based executive
director and the Chief Executive, with at least
one-third of the Chief Executive's bonus being
compulsorily deferred into the Share Matching
Plan in 2007).
In determining the performance measures for
the Annual Bonus Plan, the Committee took
the view that the Company's major investors
believed earnings per share (EPS) and cash
targets (and, where appropriate, EBITA), 
to be key indicators of long-term financial
performance and value creation. These,
coupled with the non-financial measures,
align the executive directors' objectives 
with corporate strategy and targeted
business performance.
The EPS figure used for the bonus plan (and
the Executive Share Option Plan) is based on
underlying EPS (as reported in the report and
accounts) but may be adjusted (up or down)
if necessary to ensure that the figures for
individual years are broadly comparable.
Share option plans and long-term 
incentive plans
Policy 
The Committee seeks to align the 
interests of executive directors (and 
other senior executives) with those of other
shareholders through the use of share-based
incentive schemes. The Company operates 
a combination of options and share awards 
for senior executives within the framework
detailed below. This is broadly in line 
with similar plans operated by other 
FTSE 50 companies.
In 2005, effective from 2006, the Committee
revised its policy in relation to the provision 
of share-based incentive plans by awarding
share-based long-term incentives which are
settled in shares rather than cash to those US
senior executives who qualify as Accredited
Investors , thus enhancing the alignment with
shareholders' interests. In order to operate
within existing dilution limits, the remuneration
strategy for senior managers globally below
the senior executive population has been
reviewed with share-based rewards being
replaced by a cash-based long-term incentive
plan linked to earnings performance. The
Committee believes that this will promote 
a consistent global approach and will derive
enhanced value for money from the executive
reward programmes.
The Committee also decided to settle in
shares rather than cash unvested awards 
of share options and performance shares 
for those US executives who qualify as
accredited investors. This further enhances
their alignment with shareholders' interests
and reduces the volatility of the income
statement charges arising on these awards.
In 2006 the Committee reviewed the
Company's share-based long-term incentive
plans, taking account of continuing changes
in market practice and investors' comments
following the shareholder consultation
exercise in early 2006 on changes to
executive remuneration policy. In considering
the variety of ways in which companies
reward performance in terms of plan design,
performance measures and different
weightings of short-term and long-term
rewards, the review concluded that there 
was no standard approach with companies
tailoring their corporate approach to suit 
their own sectoral or specific needs. The
Committee believes that the Company's
approach provides a good balance of 
short-term and long-term reward, potentially
more weighted towards long-term rewards
than a number of other companies, but
consequently aligned to and consistent 
with the long-term nature of the Company's
business. The Committee has therefore
retained the current long-term 
incentive arrangements. 
As part of the review, the Committee
considered the performance conditions for 
the various share-based incentive plans,
benchmarking the performance conditions
against market practice. The Committee's
conclusions are as follows:
- Performance Share Plan The Committee
has concluded that the current comparator
group and vesting schedule remain
appropriate and suitably stretching.
- Share Option Plan Until last year, share
options awards had failed to meet the
associated performance condition for a
number of years. In addition, the awards
made in 2001 and 2002 have lapsed as 
a result of failing to meet the required
performance target. Furthermore, almost 
half of the executives receiving share awards
are US executives for whom a performance
condition on share options is still rare.
The Committee is also aware that the
anticipated dilutive effect of the sale of 
the Company's stake in Airbus, which
shareholders approved last year, has 
made the existing performance conditions
potentially more stretching. The Committee
has decided that the existing EPS
performance conditions on share options 
will not be rebased but instead management
will be expected to generate sufficient growth
not only to meet the required targets but also
to recoup the anticipated dilutive effect of
the Airbus transaction.
The Committee accordingly concluded that 
to change the performance condition at this
time was unnecessary and would act as a
disincentive until executives had experience
of share options meeting required
performance conditions, and has therefore
decided to retain the existing EPS growth
condition for awards in 2007 of real EPS
growth of 5% per annum for full vesting.
This will be kept under review.
- Share Matching Plan The new Share
Matching Plan, which shareholders
approved last year, replaces the Restricted
Share Plan for awards in 2007 and
introduces an EPS performance condition
on the award of matching shares aligned to
that used for share options. The Committee
believes that this remains appropriate.
Plan provisions
Performance conditions for grants of options
or awards to be made under the Executive
Share Option Plan, the Performance Share
Plan and the Share Matching Plan in 2007
are detailed below. Performance conditions
for earlier grants under the Executive Share
Option Plan are shown as notes to Table C.
Performance conditions for grants of awards
under the Performance Share Plan made
between 2003 and 2006 are the same 
as for awards to be made in 2007 as
detailed below.
Executive Share Option Plan
Options granted under the Executive Share
Option Plan are normally exercisable between
the third and tenth anniversary of their grant.
Options may only be exercised during this
period as follows:
- 33.33% of each option grant is exercisable
if the Company achieves on average real
EPS growth per annum of 3% but less than
4% over the three-year performance period;
- 66.67% of each option grant is exercisable
if the Company achieves on average real
EPS growth per annum of 4% but less than
5% over the three-year performance period;
- 100% of each option grant is exercisable if
the Company achieves on average real EPS
growth per annum of 5% or more over the
three-year performance period.
In determining the performance measure 
for the Executive Share Option Plan (and for
the Matching Shares in the Share Matching
Plan described below), the Committee took
the view that the Company's major investors
believed EPS to be a key indicator of long-
term financial performance and value creation.
Option grants under the Executive Share
Option Plan will continue to be set at a
maximum of 1.5 times base salary (2.25
times base salary for the Chief Executive) 
in 2007 and there will be no retesting after
the three-year performance period. 
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Conditional awards of shares are made 
under the Performance Share Plan which 
are contingent on meeting pre-determined
performance criteria. Under the PSP , awards
may be made up to 2 times base salary.
Awards in 2007 to executive directors will 
be granted at a value equal to 1 times base
salary (1.5 times base salary for the Chief
Executive). The proportion of the award which
is capable of exercise is determined by the
Company's Total Shareholder Return (share
price growth plus dividends) ranking relative  www.baesystems.com 55
As a result of the Company's performance in
2006, all eligible employees (including the UK
executive directors) will be entitled to receive
shares worth  420. A similar arrangement
operates for non-UK employees on a cash 
or shares basis depending on local tax and
security laws. 
The Company operates a share purchase
arrangement (Partnership Shares) under 
the Share Incentive Plan which replaced the
SAYE Share Option Scheme in 2005. Under
this arrangement, UK-based employees
(including executive directors) may purchase
ordinary shares in BAE Systems by either
monthly investments of between  10 and
 125 a month, or lump sum investments 
of between  10 and  1,500 in a tax year,
both limited to 10% of salary if less. 
Dividends paid in respect of the shares in the
Share Incentive Plan for UK-based employees
are reinvested as Dividend Shares.
With effect from December 2006 the
Committee agreed the introduction of
Matching Shares into the Share Incentive
Plan Partnership Shares arrangement on the
basis of one free Matching Share for every
two Partnership Shares purchased by the
employee up to a maximum monthly
Partnership Share investment of  30. 
The plan is an all-employee plan and 
in accordance with legislation the 
Matching Shares are not subject 
to performance conditions.
Dilution of share capital
The Committee has agreed that, in respect
of new issue or treasury shares, shares
representing no more than 1% of the
Company's issued share capital will be used
in any one financial year for the grant of
share options under all-employee share
schemes. The table below sets out the
available dilution capacity for the Company's
employee share schemes based on the
limits set out in the rules of those schemes.
2006
Total issued share capital as
at 31 December 2006 3,246m
All schemes:
10% in any consecutive 10 years 324.6m
Remaining headroom 193.5m
Executive schemes:
5% in any consecutive 10 years 162.3m
Remaining headroom 92.9m
The number of ordinary shares in issue at
31 December 2006 was 3,246,232,539 and
the number of shares granted under option
during 2006 totalled 6,082,429 (0.19% 
of the total shares in issue). In addition, a
decision was taken in 2006 to settle awards
over 8,641,212 executive share options
(granted as Stock Appreciation Rights) in
equity, rather than in cash, for US executives
satisfying the accredited investor rules.
These are included in the dilution figures.
to a comparator group of 18 other defence and
aerospace companies operating internationally,
and by a secondary financial measure. 
Performance for the 2007 awards will be
measured as follows:
(i) Total shareholder return (TSR)
100% of the conditional shares are awarded
to directors if the Company's TSR over a
three-year period is in the top 20% of TSRs
achieved by the sectoral comparator group,
with 25% vesting if the TSR is in the top 50%.
Intermediate positions will be calculated on 
a straight-line pro-rata basis. No awards will
be made if the Company's performance is
outside the top 50%. Awards will be made 
in three equal instalments at the end of
years three, four and five. 
(ii) Underlying financial performance
As a secondary measure the Committee 
will consider whether there has been a
sustained improvement in the Company's
underlying financial performance and
whether it is appropriate to release some 
or all of the awards. In taking a view of 
a sustained improvement in underlying
financial performance, the Committee may
consider (but not exclusively) the following
financial metrics: net debt/cash; EBITA;
order book; turnover; risk and underlying
project performance.
A sectoral peer group will continue to be used
in 2007 as the principal performance measure
due to its importance to the Company's
shareholders as an indication of both earnings
and capital growth relative to major global
defence and aerospace companies. A relative
measure is considered important as it rewards
management if they outperform against major
companies in the sector rather than success
possibly being determined solely by growth 
in stock markets. The second measure was
included to ensure that awards will only vest 
if there has been a clear improvement in the
Company's underlying performance over the
relevant period.
The composition of the TSR sectoral peer
group for awards to be made in 2007 is 
the same as that in 2006 and comprises:
Boeing Cobham
Dassault Aviation EADS
Embraer PN Finmeccanica
General Dynamics GKN
Goodrich Honeywell International
Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman
Raytheon Rockwell Collins
Rolls-Royce Smiths Group
Thales United Technologies
As agreed by shareholders at the 2006 AGM,
for PSP participants other than executive
directors, the Committee has the flexibility 
to agree that up to half of any award can be
based on appropriately stretching internal
measures (with the rest based on TSR) to
create improved incentive and alignment with
the individual's own business performance.
Share Matching Plan (SMP)
Following shareholder approval at the 2006
AGM, the new Share Matching Plan replaces
the previous Restricted Share Plan in 2007.
The SMP is a stand-alone share investment
plan with the maximum investment linked to
the bonus awarded under the Annual Bonus
Plan. Participants will be invited to acquire
shares up to an amount not exceeding the
net amount of any discretionary annual
bonus the individual received for the previous
financial year (Investment Shares). As stated
above, the Chief Executive is required to
defer at least one-third of his bonus into the
SMP . The participant will be granted a
conditional award of Matching Shares under
the SMP against the gross bonus invested;
for executive directors the match will be in
the ratio of 1:1. 
The performance condition that will apply to
the Matching Shares under the SMP in
2007, and the rationale for its use, is the
same as that which has been applied to
options granted under the Company's
executive share option plans as set out on
page 54.
The Matching Shares will attract dividends
during the three-year deferral period which
will be released at the same time as the
vesting of any Matching Shares.
Restricted Share Plan
The Restricted Share Plan (RSP), which
operated for the final time in 2006,
historically acted as a share-based
extension of the Annual Bonus Plan in that
executive directors who participated in the
Annual Bonus Plan could be given the option
of taking any net cash bonus paid partly or
wholly in shares through the RSP . If an
election was made to take shares through
the Plan, they were held in trust for a period
of three years after which the Company
awarded the individual an equal number of
shares (Matching Shares) provided the
individual normally remained in the
Company's employment at the vesting date.
Where executive directors have elected to
use such bonuses through the RSP , details
of the shares held are set out in Table B on
page 60. None of the executive directors
who served during 2006 participated in the
2006 operation of the RSP. 
The matching award of shares was
historically not subject to any performance
criteria and has now been superseded by 
the Share Matching Plan which is subject 
to performance criteria.
Share Incentive Plan
During 2006 the UK executive directors were

BAE Systems on 31 December 2001 compared with the value of  100 invested in
the FTSE 100 Index. The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial
year ends.
The graph, which has been produced in accordance with the requirements of
Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985, shows the total shareholder return for 
a holding in the Company's ordinary shares for the period 2001-2006 relative to 
a holding of shares representing the FTSE 100. The FTSE 100 is considered to be 
an appropriate comparator for this purpose as it is a broad equity market index.
As BAE Systems is a constituent member of the FTSE 100, it was deemed to be 
the most appropriate general UK equity index.

Remuneration report
Personal shareholding policy
The Committee has agreed a policy 
whereby all executive directors are required
to establish and maintain a minimum
personal shareholding equal to 200% of
base salary. As a minimum, a holding equal
to 100% of base salary must be achieved 
as quickly as possible using shares vesting
or options exercised through the executive
share option schemes or long-term incentive
schemes, by using 50% of the shares 
that vest or 50% of the options which are
exercised on each occasion. Thereafter,
executive directors are required to increase
their personal shareholding gradually, on
each occasion using 25% of the shares 
that vest or 25% of the options exercised
each year, until a personal shareholding
equal to 200% of annual base salary is
achieved and maintained. These limits 
are reviewed periodically. 
Details of the directors' personal
shareholdings are shown in Table A. 
Post-retirement benefits
UK pension benefits
As a result of the recently introduced age
discrimination legislation, UK executive
directors' default retirement age will be 65
but they will retain any previous rights they
had to retire and draw their pensions without
actuarial reduction for early payment at 
an earlier age.
Following the consultations with employees
last year, a number of changes were made to
the pension schemes in respect of benefits
accruing from 6 April 2006 as a means 
and 2.5% per year in respect of service from
6 April 2006. Directors pay contributions 
at the same rate as all other employees
participating in schemes.
Michael Lester, who retired from the Board 
at the end of 2006, had a normal retirement
age of 62 and was already in receipt of 
his pension.
Ian King is a member of the BAE Systems
2000 Pension Plan (the 2000 Plan)
applicable to former employees of Marconi
Electronic Systems (MES) and a member of
the ExPS. The 2000 Plan provides a pension
of 1/50th of Final Pensionable Earnings
(FPE) for each year of pensionable service,
payable from a normal retirement age of 65.
FPE under the 2000 Plan is the best three-
year average of base salary and bonus in the
ten Plan Years prior to leaving, less an offset
for State pensions. The Company decided
last year to limit pensionable bonuses in the
2000 Plan in the 2006/07 Plan Year to 20%
of base salary and this will reduce to 10% of
base salary for the Plan Year commencing on
6 April 2007. However, there is a guarantee
that the FPE figure for benefits service prior
to 6 April 2007 will not be less than the 
FPE figure at 5 April 2007 to ensure that
employees do not lose the benefit of
contributions paid on past bonuses. Ian 
King joined the ExPS in 1999 following the
BAe/MES merger. The ExPS tops up the
2000 Plan benefits to provide a target
benefit payable from age 62 of 1/30th of
Final Pensionable Pay for each year of ExPS

of two-thirds). Final Pensionable Pay for the

of funding the deficits disclosed in the
schemes. These changes apply to executive
directors in the same way as to other
employees and include the introduction of the
Longevity Adjustment Factor, a reduction in
the maximum level of pension increases and
a change in the definition of Pensionable Pay.
The UK-based executive directors with 
the exception of Ian King (see below) are
members of the BAE Systems Pension
Scheme (the Main Scheme) and the
BAE Systems Executive Pension Scheme 
(the ExPS). The ExPS tops up the benefits
from the Main Scheme and, for executive
directors, is designed to produce a target
pension payable from age 60 of two-thirds 
of Final Pensionable Pay (FPP) if potential
service is 20 or more years. FPP is defined
as basic salary averaged over the last
12 months prior to leaving service in respect
of service accrued to 5 April 2006 and
36 months prior to leaving in respect of
service from 6 April 2006. These schemes
also provide a lump sum death-in-service
benefit equal to four times basic salary 
at date of death, and a spouse's death-in-
service pension equal to two-thirds of the
prospective pension at normal retirement
age. Children's allowances are also payable,
usually up to the age of 18. Spouses'
pensions and children's allowances are also
payable upon death in retirement and death
after leaving the Company's employment with
a deferred pension. Pensions are increased
annually by the rise in the Retail Prices Index
subject to a maximum increase of 5% per
year in respect of pre 6 April 2006 service www.baesystems.com 57
of an unfunded promise from the Company. 
No further contributions will be paid into his
funded unapproved top up arrangement.
Further information on the amounts paid by
the Company in respect of these arrangements
is included in the notes to Table F.
US Executives
Mark Ronald retired from the Board at the
end of 2006 and was already in receipt of
his pension.
Walt Havenstein is a member of the
BAE Systems Employees' Retirement Plan
which provides a pension from age 60 for
each year of pensionable service of 1.25%
on his Final Average Pay (FAP) up to Social
Security Covered Compensation (circa
$70,000) plus 1.5% on his FAP in excess of
Social Security Covered Compensation. FAP
is currently the highest three-year average 
of base salary plus bonus but the averaging
period will increase by one year each year
beginning in 2009 and reaching a ten-year
average in 2015. Directors pay contributions
at the same rates as other employees in 
the plan. The pension does not carry any
spouse's pension or pension increases. Walt
Havenstein also receives a 50% match on
his contributions to his 401(k) plan up to 
a maximum contribution of 8% of earnings.
Details of post-retirement benefits for 
each of the executive directors who served
during 2006 are shown in Table F on
page 65 and are calculated in accordance
with the requirements of Schedule 7A 
of the Companies Act 1985.
Other benefits
Other benefits provided to the executive
directors include a car allowance, the taxable
benefit of any private use of a chauffeur, and
a cash allowance for medical examination.
purposes of this top up is calculated by
reference to base salary only, averaged over
12 months and 36 months as described
above. Therefore Ian King's total pension is
the sum of his 2000 Plan benefits plus the
top up from the ExPS. 
Following the changes made last year to take
account of the Pensions Simplification tax
changes which came into effect from April
2006, UK executives reaching the Lifetime
Allowance (LTA) are given a number of
choices as set out in last year's
remuneration report. These are: 
- remain in the pension scheme and pay any
additional tax charge; or
- opt out of the pension scheme (and 
so earn no further pension benefits in
respect of future service) and instead
receive a taxable salary supplement. This
supplement will be 30% of salary and 20%
of salary for those senior executives with 
a two-thirds salary target after at least 20
years and 30 years service respectively; or 
- restrict scheme benefits to the value of 
the LTA with the remainder being provided
directly from the Company as an unfunded
promise. At retirement, the unfunded
Company benefits can be either taken 
as pension or can be commuted in full 
for a taxable lump sum. 
The Committee reviewed these arrangements
at the beginning of 2007 in the light of
developing market practice and believes 
they remain appropriate as they provide
executives with choices which may better
suit their needs whilst being broadly cost
neutral to the Company, are in line with
market practice, and do not compensate
executives for changes in taxation.
UK executives, including the UK executive
directors, affected or likely to be affected 
by the Lifetime Allowance before April 2009
were provided with independent financial
advice paid for by the Company. Mike Turner
and Chris Geoghegan elected to opt out of
the pension schemes in April 2006 in return
for a cash supplement of 30% of base
salary. Steve Mogford and Ian King elected
to have their scheme benefits restricted in
return for a Company unfunded promise. 
George Rose was affected by the previously
applicable Inland Revenue earnings cap on
approved pensions and has an unapproved
(i.e. non-tax qualified) pension arrangement
to top up his benefits from the approved
schemes. This was designed so that the
total pension from all sources would be
broadly in line with the pension he would
have received from the group pension
schemes had he not been subject to the
earnings cap. The Pension Simplification tax
changes have allowed the flexibility to remove
the earnings cap for George Rose in respect of
service from April 2006, although some of his
benefits will remain to be provided by means
Executive directors' service contracts
It is the Committee's policy that executive directors should normally have service contracts
that provide for the company to give the individual 12 months' notice of termination. This
policy has been chosen because it provides a reasonable balance between the need to retain
the services of key individuals and the need to limit the liabilities of the Company in the event
of the termination of a contract. The executive directors have service contracts with Group
companies; details of these contracts are as follows:
Date of contract Unexpired term Notice period
Chris Geoghegan 10 July 2002 12 months 12 months either party

and 14 October 2005)
Remuneration report
In the event of the termination of an
executive director's contract it is the
Committee's policy to seek to limit any
payment made in lieu of notice to a
payment equal to the amount of one year's
basic salary. The service contracts for all 
of the executive directors contain specific
provisions to the effect that the Company
has the right, and in Walt Havenstein's
case, generally has the obligation, to pay a
sum equivalent to 12 months' salary (plus
the continuation of 18 months' medical
benefits in Walt Havenstein's case) in the
event of the Company terminating their
contracts for reasons other than gross
misconduct. No executive director has 
provisions in his service contract that 
relate to a change of control of the
Company (and neither does the Chairman
nor the non-executive directors in their
respective letters of appointment).
Michael Lester and Mark Ronald, who
retired as directors on 31 December 2006,
also had service contracts. The service
contract for Michael Lester was dated
26 November 1999 and had been renewed
on a rolling one year basis since 2002
when he reached his normal retirement 
age of 62. The service contract came to 
an end when he retired from the Board 
on 31 December 2006. Chairman's appointment, term and fees
Dick Olver was appointed Chairman on
1 July 2004. His appointment is for an
initial fixed three year term with effect 
from 17 May 2004 (the date that he was
appointed to the Board as a non-executive
director) unless terminated earlier in
accordance with the Company's Articles 
of Association, or by either party giving the
other not less than six months' prior written
notice. His appointment is documented in a
letter of appointment which is not a contract
of employment and he is required to devote
no fewer than two days a week to his duties
as Chairman. The Nominations Committee
will review his appointment prior to the end
of the three-year term and will, if appropriate
(and subject to the agreement of Mr Olver),
recommend to the Board that he be invited
to serve for an additional period. His
appointment as Chairman will automatically
terminate if he ceases to be a director of
the Company. His fee, which has been set
by the Committee at  500,000 per annum,
will not be subject to review during the initial
three-year term.
Non-executive directors' appointment, term
and fees
The non-executive directors do not have
service contracts but do have letters of
appointment detailing the basis of their
appointment. The dates of their original
appointment were as follows:

* subject to re-election at the AGM following their
appointment and subsequently at intervals of no more
than three years in accordance with the Company's
Articles of Association
The non-executive directors are normally
appointed for two consecutive three-year
terms subject to review after the end of the
first three-year period and with any third term
of three years being subject to rigorous
review and taking into account the need
progressively to refresh the Board. They do
not have periods of notice and the Company
has no obligation to pay compensation when
their appointment terminates. They are
subject to re-election at the AGM following
their appointment and subsequently at
intervals of no more than three years.
Michael Portillo retired from the Board at 
the conclusion of the 2006 AGM on 4 May
2006, having originally been appointed 
to the Board on 11 September 2002. 
The letters of appointment for non-executive
directors detail the amount of time it is
anticipated that the individual will need to
devote to his or her duties as a director.
Non-executive directors are proposed by the
Nominations Committee and are appointed
by the Board on the basis of their experience
to provide independent judgement on issues
of strategy, performance, resources and
standards of conduct. The level of their 
fees is set after reviewing practice in 
other comparable companies. 
Details of the non-executive directors' fees
in 2006 are shown in Table E on page 64.
Fees payable to the non-executive directors
are agreed by the Non-Executive Directors'
Fees Committee. Non-executive directors are
paid a fee reflecting the time commitment
required of the director. The fee level for 
the chairmen of the Audit, Corporate
Responsibility, and Remuneration Committees,
and for the Senior Independent Director,
reflects their additional responsibilities and
workload. In addition, a transatlantic meeting
allowance of  4,000 per board meeting is
payable to non-executive directors; this takes
into account the additional time commitment
required by the European-based non-executive
directors to attend board meetings in the US
and similarly the commitment of US-based
non-executive directors to attend board
meetings in Europe.
The fees payable to the non-executive
directors were reviewed in February 2007
and the following fee structure was 
agreed for 2007 to reflect the various
responsibilities of the individual directors: a
fee of  77,500 for the chairman of the Audit
Committee; a fee of  72,500 for each of the
chairman of the Remuneration Committee,
the chairman of the Corporate Responsibility
Committee, and the Senior Independent
Director; and a fee of  57,500 for each 
of the other non-executive directors.

Remuneration report
The service contract for Mark Ronald was
dated 17 April 2002 and had been renewed
on a rolling one year basis since 2003 when
he reached his normal retirement age of 62.
The service contract came to an end when
Mark Ronald retired from the BAE Systems
plc Board and as President and Chief
Executive of BAE Systems, Inc. on
31 December 2006. As disclosed previously,
the terms of Mark Ronald's contract
contained an entitlement to a lump sum
equal to 12 months' salary and the
continuance of medical benefits for 18
months if his contract was terminated by
BAE Systems, Inc., his directorship of the
parent company ceased, or if his contract
was not renewed at the end of its one year
rolling term. Details of this contractual
payment are included in Table E on page 64.
In order for the Company to benefit from
his considerable experience of the US
defence market, Mark Ronald has been
appointed as non-executive Chairman 
of BAE Systems, Inc. with effect from
15 January 2007 and will also provide
advisory services. Fees payable to him in
his non-executive capacity are consistent
with those paid to other non-executive
directors of BAE Systems, Inc. These
arrangements will automatically cease 
on 31 December 2007 unless he and
BAE Systems, Inc. mutually agree to 
extend them for a further year.
Policy on external board appointments
The long-standing policy of allowing executive
directors to hold external non-BAE Systems
related non-executive directorships with the
prior approval of the Committee will continue.
The Committee considers that external
directorships provide the Company's senior
executives with valuable experience that is of
benefit to BAE Systems. It is also considered
appropriate for BAE Systems to contribute to
the pool of non-executive expertise available
for the benefit of the wider business
community, thereby reciprocating the benefit
which it in turn has received from other
organisations which have permitted members
of their senior management teams to serve
on the BAE Systems Board. The Committee
believes that it is reasonable for the
individual executive director to retain any fees
received from such appointments given the
additional personal responsibility that this
entails. Such fees retained by the executive
directors who served in 2006 were as
follows: Michael Lester:  16,135; Steve
Mogford:  13,016; George Rose:  65,000;
and Mike Turner:  43,756 plus grants of
Deferred Stock Units to the value of  42,118. www.baesystems.com 59

As at 31 December 2006, the directors of the Company and their families had the following beneficial and non-beneficial interests in the
Company's securities. There have been no changes in the interests of the current directors listed in the table below between 31 December
2006 and 21 February 2007 with the exception of: 
(i) the share interests of Steve Mogford who has acquired an additional 63 ordinary shares since 31 December 2006 under the partnership
and matching shares elements of the Share Incentive Plan so that his beneficial shareholding at the date of this report stood at 149,003;
and 
(ii) the option figures for Chris Geoghegan, Steve Mogford, George Rose and Mike Turner which have reduced on account of the lapse of share
options in February 2007 so that their option figures as at the date of this report were as follows: Chris Geoghegan: 1,201,873; 
Steve Mogford: 1,235,703; George Rose: 1,400,520; and Mike Turner: 2,169,697.

The BAE Systems Executive Share Option Plan has been used to grant options to the executive directors since 2001. The performance conditions applying to the grants of options made
in 2001-2004 are the same as for grants to be made in 2007, as set out on page 54 of this report, with the exception of the re-testing provision: for grants made between 2001-2003,
where the original three-year performance is not met, performance is re-tested at the end of years four and five against the full period from grant; for grants made in 2004, where the
original performance target is not met, performance is re-tested at the end of year five against the full period from grant. In all these cases the option will lapse in year five if the targets
have not been achieved. The performance conditions applying to the grants of options made in 2005 and 2006 are the same as for grants to be made in 2007, as set out on page 54
of this report; there is no re-testing of performance for grants made in 2005 and beyond.
On completion of the BAE/MES merger in 1999, options were granted to executive directors under the predecessor Executive Share Option Scheme. Options granted to Michael Lester
and Mark Ronald in 1999 could only be exercised if the pre-exceptional EPS for any three-year period exceeded the sum of inflation for that period and a real growth requirement of 9%
was achieved and these options vested in full in February 2006. Options granted to the other executive directors in 1999 (which partially vested in 2004) were conditional on the
satisfaction of a special performance condition based on the achievement of cost savings of the merger integration process over the three year performance period commencing on
1 January 2000.
In addition, Mark Ronald has a cash-settled Stock Appreciation Right (SAR) over 115,675 ordinary shares granted on 3 May 2000 at a SAR price of  3.98, exercisable from 3 May
2003. The potential payment on exercise is the difference between the SAR price and the share price on the date of exercise. The right is exercisable until 31 December 2007 and
was subject to the performance condition relating to options granted in 2000 (i.e. exercisable only if growth in pre-exceptional EPS for any three-year period over the ten-year life
exceeded the sum of inflation for that period and a real growth requirement of 9%) which has been met.

1 Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with GN11 issued by the actuarial profession. For UK-based directors the assumptions are the same as those used in the
calculation of cash equivalents from the Group's UK pension schemes. The amount of the increase in transfer value arising from the change in assumptions is: 
Chris Geoghegan  61,658; Steve Mogford  39,874; George Rose  43,042; Mike Turner  53,331.
2 As a result of the changes to taxation of pensions introduced in April 2006, Mike Turner and Chris Geoghegan elected to opt out of their pension schemes and since April 2006
have been receiving a taxable salary supplement of 30% of their basic salaries. 
3 George Rose's unapproved retirement arrangement is partly funded and partly unfunded. The Company's pension contribution to the funded unapproved retirement arrangement 
for George Rose in 2006 was  336,657 (2005  569,378). Of this amount, approximately  100,507 (2005  377,328) relates to the cost of benefits accruing during the year 
and approximately  236,150 relates to fully funding the unapproved arrangement for pensionable service up to 6 April 2006.
