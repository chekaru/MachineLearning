During the year Mike Turner served as a member of the Non-
Executive Directors' Fees Committee until his retirement at
the end of August 2008.
Responsibilities
- Reviewing the fees payable to non-executive directors
(excluding the Chairman) and making changes to such
fees as deemed appropriate.
Governance
The Non-Executive Directors' Fees Committee has delegated
authority from the Board to agree fees payable to non-executive
directors on its behalf.
Activities
The Board has approved the following guidelines to be used
by the Committee when discharging its responsibilities:
- fees shall be sufficient to attract and retain individuals with the
necessary skills,experience and knowledge required to ensure
that the Board is able to discharge its duties effectively;
- in setting fees the Committee shall have regard to the amount of
time individual non-executive directors are required to devote to
their duties and also the scale and complexity and international
nature of the business and the responsibility involved;
- fees payable to non-executive directors shall be paid in cash and
shall not be performance-related; and
- non-executive directors shall not participate in the Company's
share-based incentive schemes or pension scheme.
The Committee meets each year to consider the fees paid
to the non-executive directors. Having first reviewed the time
commitments expected of non-executive directors and the
market competitive positioning of existing fee levels,the
Committee agreed the changes detailed on page 86.

Remuneration strategy and policy for executive directors
Remuneration strategy and 2008 review
The Committee undertook a major review of the remuneration
strategy in the second half of 2007 and as a result made a
number of changes for 2008 which:
- brought the remuneration packages into line with market
competitive levels;
- simplified the arrangements to improve line-of-sight between
performance and reward;
- shifted the focus towards long-term sustainable growth
in earnings per share (EPS);
- reinforced the key aspects of the Group's Corporate
Responsibility agenda;
- directly aligned short-term and long-term reward through
compulsory deferral of part of the annual incentive into the
Share Matching Plan for all executive directors; and
- increased the gearing to drive for high performance as most
of the improvement in the package is only delivered for
achieving more stretching targets.
This review was set out in detail in last year's report. Following
the annual review in November 2008,the Committee concluded
that the current remuneration strategy remains appropriate,and
intends to continue with the executive remuneration policy as
detailed in this report in 2009 and subsequent years for executive
directors,and this policy will be flowed down to the most senior
executives within the Group globally (approximately 280) to create
a consistent global approach to reward. The principles of the
remuneration strategy are applied consistently across the
Group below this level,taking account of seniority and local
market practice.
The Committee will continue to consult on material changes with
principal shareholders.
Summarised below is the Company's remuneration strategy and
policy for executive directors,together with the individual elements
of the package and their purpose.
This section of the report explains the Company's remuneration strategy and policy,the individual components
of executive directors' remuneration and details of their service contracts as required by legislation.
Strategy
To provide a remuneration package that:
- helps to attract,retain and motivate
- is aligned to shareholders' interests
- is competitive against the appropriate market
- encourages and supports a high-performance culture
- is fair and transparent
- can be applied consistently throughout the Group
Policy
- Set base salary at around median of the relevant market
competitive level
- Reward stretching superior performance with upper quartile
reward
- Balance between:
- short-term and long-term reward
- fixed and variable reward
- with balance becoming more long-term and more highly
geared with seniority
- Directly align short-term and long-term reward through
compulsory deferral of annual incentive into the
Share Matching Plan
- Competitive package of benefits For the US Chief Operating Officer,regression analysis was used
on US aerospace,defence and general industry sector data to
produce appropriate market figures consistent with the size and
scale of the US business,adjusting where necessary to reflect
the extra responsibility for his plc board role.
The base salary,total cash reward (base salary plus annual
incentive),total direct reward (total cash reward plus long-term
incentives) and total reward (total direct reward plus pension) were
analysed at the median and upper quartile for the relevant posts
in the comparator group companies. This gives the Committee
a view on the competitiveness of the individual elements of the
package as well as the package as a whole.
The Committee also reviewed market trends around the individual
elements of remuneration to ensure that the structure of the
package stays in line with market practice. The remuneration
structure overall also takes account of the performance of the
individual,the Company as a whole and the pay and conditions
of Group employees.
Base salary
As a result of the above review and,having taken account of the
competitive pay positioning,performance and general market
trends,the Committee has increased the annual base salaries
of executive directors with effect from 1 January 2009 as follows:
Appointment of new Chief Executive
Prior to the annual review of remuneration strategy,the Company
announced on 27 June 2008 the appointment of Ian King,previously
Chief Operating Officer - UK/RoW,as Chief Executive with effect
from 1 September 2008. The Committee agreed a package for
Ian King which it considered to be competitive and appropriate to
incentivise him to deliver the next phase of the Company's strategy.
This comprised annual base salary of  850,000,maximum annual
incentive opportunity for 2008 of 225% of base salary (pro-rated for
the period from appointment) and total award of Performance Shares
in 2008 of 250% of base salary.
The following sections describe in more detail the subsequent
2008 review and the specific arrangements for executive directors.
Approach to the 2008 remuneration review
The 2008 review not only considered the Company's executive
remuneration packages against the market but also the
Company's performance to date and its corporate strategy
for the next five years.
Information on the market for comparable management positions
was provided by PwC so that the Committee could form a view as
to where to position the various elements of the package relative
to comparable companies.
The methodology used was to construct appropriate comparator
groups for the individual positions,taking account of company
size,scale of operations and breadth of role. The comparator
group for the UK executive directors comprised the FTSE 50
companies (excluding financial services and retail) with market
capitalisation nearest to that of BAE Systems. The Committee
believes that using market capitalisation creates alignment
between the value placed on the Company and the value placed
on the executives who manage it. The six largest companies were
also excluded as were several others to arrive at a comparator
group of 23 companies (11 larger and 12 smaller) which the
Committee believed appropriate for benchmarking UK executive
directors' packages.

Incentives
The Group strategy is set out on page 10 along with the Group
Strategic Framework. This explains how the Group strategy is
delivered through the Group Strategic Objectives,which apply
across all businesses and are championed by the Executive
Committee,and the Business Portfolio Actions,which apply to
the businesses individually or jointly and are championed by the
relevant Executive Committee members. Both are underpinned by
the Integrated Business Plan (IBP) which sets out the individual
businesses' plans for the next five years in terms of strategy,
actions and performance,making sure they are aligned to
collectively deliver the Group strategy.
Each year,the Board agrees the Executive Committee's top ten
objectives which are those key to delivering the Group's strategy.
These are set out on page 9 and are used as the basis to set the
individual objectives for the executive directors which are agreed
by the Chairman,Dick Olver and the Committee. These then flow
down to members of the Executive Committee and the senior
leadership team to ensure that all businesses within the Group
are aligned with the overall Group strategy.
The remuneration strategy incentivises and rewards executives to
deliver their contribution to the achievement of the Group strategy
through the combination of short-term incentives targeted at
business performance,Group performance,personal performance
and leadership behaviours,and long-term incentives targeted
at Group performance. To directly align short-term and long-term
reward,executive directors will be required to invest at least one-
third of their net 2009 annual incentive into the Share Matching
Plan (SMP) when the annual incentive is paid in 2010. Further
investment can be made on a voluntary basis up to a maximum
investment of half their net annual incentive.
Annual Incentive Plan
The annual incentives for 2009 continue to focus on a combination
of in-year financial performance and longer-term performance
and risk management (both business risk and reputation risk).
Two-thirds is driven off in-year financial performance and one-third
based on driving performance and improvement in ethics and safety
(reinforcing the importance of key aspects of the Group's Corporate
Responsibility agenda) combined with the other objectives
supporting the Group's strategy.
To remain competitive,the 2009 maximum annual incentive
opportunity for the Group Finance Director increases from 125%
to 150% of base salary but one-third will be compulsorily invested
into the SMP (compared to one-quarter of the 2008 annual
incentive). Table (i) below summarises the revised annual
incentive structure and levels for the executive directors.
The financial targets are derived from the IBP and are based on
earnings and cash targets as these are seen as the key indicators
of both short-term and long-term financial performance and value
creation,and are supported by the Company's major shareholders.
At Group level,EPS is used whereas EBITA
2
is used to measure
earnings performance at a business level. Previously cash targets
have been based on net cash/debt at the year end. For 2009,
to incentivise improved phasing of cash generation throughout the
year,a combination of year end and average net cash/debt will be
used. As last year,the payout for achieving on-target performance
against the in-year financial targets remains at 40% of maximum.
The Committee believes that the annual incentive targets for the
executive directors are stretching but achievable. The structure
of the 2009 annual incentive plan for executive directors is
summarised in table (ii) below.

Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs)
The Company operates two LTIPs (having ceased awards of share
options in 2008) - the Performance Share Plan (PSP) and the Share
Matching Plan (SMP). At the May 2008 AGM,shareholders approved:
- an increase in the maximum annual award under the PSP to four
times base salary;
- half the PSP awards to use a performance condition based on
internal metrics (EPS for 2008),with the remaining half to continue
to use Total Shareholder Return (TSR); and
- an improvement in the SMP match to 2:1 for improved performance.
Full details of the PSP and SMP are contained on pages 82 and 83.
To maintain a competitive package,the 2009 PSP awards for the
Group Finance Director will be 250% of base salary so that all
three executive directors will have the same level of awards in 2009.
Proportion of package value delivered through fixed and
performance-related reward
The following chart re-expresses this as a proportion of the
overall package and shows that,for the Group Finance Director,
more than half the package is performance-related at on-target
performance rising to over three quarters at stretch performance.
For the Chief Executive and US Chief Operating Officer,these
figures are even higher at two-thirds at on-target performance and
85% at stretch performance. It also demonstrates the importance
of the SMP, which is the largest driver of gearing in the package
and delivers a similar value to the PSP at stretch performance.

Pension provision
Following the changes made recently in the UK in response to
pensions simplification legislation (as reported in 2006),no
further changes to the pension arrangements for UK executive
directors are required.
As reported last year,following the increases in US annual incentive
levels,the Committee undertook a review of pensionability of
annual incentives for US executives. Given the changes made
in 2006 to increase the pay averaging period for existing US
executives to ten years by 2015,the Committee decided that
annual incentives should continue to be pensionable in line
with normal US practice but to limit the maximum pensionability
to 150% of base salary from 2008.

Performance in 2008
The structure of the 2008 Annual Incentive Plan was set out
in last year's Remuneration report and summarised below.
Financial performance
2008 was another very successful year,building on the strong
performance of recent years. Stretch performance targets on
EPS,profit and cash were each achieved at the plc,UK/RoW
and BAE Systems,Inc. levels. At the individual business level,
the major businesses achieved stretch on most but not all their
targets with notable performances in Land & Armaments and
Military Air Solutions. Three of the smaller businesses did not
meet their targets on one or other of the profit and cash elements.
Non-financial performance
The Executive Committee's Top Ten objectives for 2008 and the
assessment of performance against these are set out on page7,
whilst page 49 provides more detailed information on Objective
10,which relates to the Corporate Responsibility agenda,and
the performance against this.
Significant progress was made against the ethics objective,
including developing the Global Code of Conduct and rolling
this out to all employees from January 2009,and the Group is
on plan with its programme to implement the Woolf Committee
recommendations. The Committee awarded the full stretch payout
to the executive directors in respect of that part of the annual
incentive driven off ethics performance.
On safety,all major operational sites (other than those acquired
during the year) achieved Level 3 against the five-level Safety
Maturity Matrix and have submitted plans to achieve Level 5 by
the end of 2011. Senior Leaders undertook formal training and
completed safety audits. Regrettably,there were five employee
fatalities during the year,two on company sites and three
deployed on active service with the US armed forces. The gap
between Group performance and external benchmarks on days
lost to work-related injuries was closed by 9% during the year,
falling short of the target of 10%. The Committee awarded only
one-third of the potential payout on that part of the annual
incentive driven off safety performance.
On other objectives supporting the Group Strategy,significant
progress was made against all the eight remaining Top Ten
objectives and the Committee agreed an overall assessment of
7 out of 8. The Committee also reviewed the individual directors'
overall performance and their behavioural performance.
Accordingly,the Committee determined the payout under the 2008
Annual Incentive Plan as follows:
2008 annual Mike Ian Walt George
incentive payout Turner King Havenstein Rose
% of stretch 93.7% 94.7% 92.7% 93.9%
% of base salary 140.5% 150.0% 208.5% 117.3%
Amount  1,405,000  1,275,000 $1,876,500  695,200
In addition:
- The real growth in EPS over the three years to 2008 exceeded
5% pa so that the awards of share options granted in 2006 vest
in full.
- The Company's TSR for awards of shares made in June 2005
under the Performance Share Plan exceeded the upper quintile
position when compared against the comparator group of 18
other defence and aerospace companies. The Committee has
satisfied itself that there has been a sustainable improvement
in the underlying performance of the Group over the three-year
performance period and so this award has vested in full.
- The TSR for the PSP award made in December 2005 fell just
short of the upper quintile position and accordingly 97.1% of
the award vested.
The Committee also determined that the performance conditions
attached to the special incentive awarded to Mike Turner in
October 2007,which related to continuing the successful
implementation of the Company's business strategy,satisfaction
of leadership objectives set by the Committee,achieving an
orderly handover of key external relationships,and facilitating an
orderly succession to the Chief Executive role,had been met in
full. Accordingly the whole of the award vested. This comprised
an award of 231,618 shares and a cash payment of  1,181,250.
Half the shares and cash were released on his retirement on
1 September 2008 with the remaining half due to be released
a year later. The share award is included in Table B on page 91
and the cash award is included in Table C on page 92.

Performance conditions for grants of awards to be made under the Performance Share Plan and the Share Matching Plan in 2009
are detailed below. Performance conditions for grants of awards made prior to 2009 are detailed on pages 88 and 89.
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Key features for PSP awards in 2009:
- half the PSP award will be based on a Total Shareholder Return performance condition (PSP
TSR
) and the other half on an Earnings
per Share (PSP
EPS
) performance condition;
- length of period for performance condition: three years with any shares vesting paid out in three equal tranches on vesting at the end
of years three,four and five; and
- shares under award attract dividends prior to vesting.
The graph below summarises the current position on the
TSR element for outstanding awards under the PSP as at
31 December 2008. The coloured box shows the range of
TSR required for 25% vesting to full vesting,and the square
shows BAE Systems' TSR.

None of the shares vest if the Company's TSR is outside the
top 50% of TSRs achieved by the sectoral comparator group
and 100% vest if it is in the top quintile (ie top 20%) as set
out below:
and
(ii) whether there has been a sustained improvement in the
Company's underlying financial performance and whether
it is appropriate to release some or all of the awards. In
taking such a view,the Committee may consider (but not
exclusively) the following financial metrics: net cash/debt;
EBITA
1
; order book; turnover; risk and underlying project
performance.
- Rationale for performance measures: importance to major
investors as an indication of both earnings and capital
growth relative to other major companies in the same
sector and to ensure that awards only vest if there has
been a clear improvement in the Company's performance
over the relevant period.
Share Matching Plan (SMP)
Key features for grants of awards in 2009:
- stand-alone share investment plan with the investment linked
to the award under the Annual Incentive Plan;
- participants are granted a conditional award of Matching
Shares against the gross value of the annual incentive invested;
- Matching Shares attract dividends during the three-year deferral
period,released on vesting of any Matching Shares;
- executive directors are required to invest one-third of their
2008 net annual incentive into the SMP; and
- maximum level of investment will be 50% of the net
annual incentive.
Match and performance condition
- Nil match for actual EPS growth of less than 5% pa increasing
uniformly to a 2:1 match at 11% pa growth.
- Rationale for performance measure: major investors consider
EPS to be a key indicator of long-term financial performance
and value creation.
Personal shareholding policy
The Committee has agreed a policy whereby all executive directors
are required to establish and maintain a minimum personal
shareholding equal to 200% of base salary. As a minimum,a
holding equal to 100% of base salary must be achieved as quickly
as possible using shares vesting or options exercised through the
executive share option schemes or long-term incentive schemes,
by using 50% of the shares that vest or 50% of the options which
are exercised on each occasion. Thereafter,executive directors are
required to increase their personal shareholding gradually,on each
occasion using 25% of the shares that vest or 25% of the options
exercised each year,until a personal shareholding equal to 200%
of annual base salary is achieved and maintained. These limits
are reviewed periodically. A similar arrangement applies to senior
executives eligible for share-based long-term incentives with limits
aligned to the levels of awards made under these plans.
Details of the directors' personal shareholdings are shown in
Table A on page 87.

1 Earnings before amortisation and impairment of intangible assets,finance costs and taxation expense. Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
During 2008 the UK executive directors were eligible to participate
in the all-employee free shares element of the Share Incentive
Plan. As a result of the Company's performance in 2008,all eligible
employees (including the UK executive directors) will be entitled
to receive shares worth  524. A similar arrangement operates for
non-UK employees on a cash or shares basis depending on local
tax and security laws.
The Company operates a share purchase arrangement (Partnership
Shares) under the Share Incentive Plan. Under this arrangement,
UK-based employees (including executive directors) may purchase
ordinary shares in BAE Systems by either monthly investments
of between  10 and  125 a month,or lump sum investments
of between  10 and  1,500 in a tax year,both limited to 10%
of salary if less. The Partnership Shares attract Matching Shares.
As the plan is an all-employee plan,the Matching Shares are not
subject to performance conditions in accordance with legislation.
One free matching share is awarded for each Partnership Share
up to a maximum of  63 per month.
Dividends paid in respect of the shares in the Share Incentive
Plan for UK-based employees are reinvested as Dividend Shares.
Dilution of share capital
The Committee has agreed that,in respect of new issue or
treasury shares,shares representing no more than 1% (and no
more than 0.5% for the executive schemes) of the Company's
issued share capital will be used in any one financial year for the
grant of incentives under all of the Company's employee share
schemes. The table below sets out the available dilution capacity
for the Company's employee share schemes based on the limits
set out in the rules of those schemes.
2008
Total issued share capital as at 31 December 2008 3,582m
All schemes:
10% in any consecutive 10 years 358.2m
Remaining headroom 237.7m
Executive schemes:
5% in any consecutive 10 years 179.1m
Remaining headroom 107.2m
The Company currently intends to use new issue shares to satisfy
future share awards under the executive long-term incentive plans
up to the 0.5% annual dilution limit,and to use treasury shares
to satisfy awards of free shares and matching shares under the
all-employee Share Incentive Plan. For outstanding options it is
intended that new issue shares will be utilised for the Executive
Share Option Plan,and treasury and new issue shares for the
all-employee Save-As-You-Earn Share Option Scheme.
Post-retirement benefits
UK pension benefits
UK executive directors are members of the BAE Systems
Executive Pension Scheme (the ExPS) and members of the
underlying employee pension plans. As such,they are subject
to the same contribution rates payable by employees of the
underlying plans,and the benefits changes introduced in 2006 for
post April 2006 service including the introduction of the Longevity
Adjustment Factor,a reduction in the maximum level of pension
increases and a change in the definition of Pensionable Pay.
The ExPS tops up the underlying employee plan to provide a target
benefit for executive directors payable from normal retirement age
of 1/30th of Final Pensionable Pay (FPP) for each year of ExPS
pensionable service (subject to a maximum of two-thirds of FPP).
FPP is defined as base salary averaged over the last 12 months
prior to leaving service in respect of service accrued to 5 April
2006 and 36 months prior to leaving in respect of service from
6 April 2006. The ExPS also provides a lump sum death-in-service
benefit equal to four times base salary at date of death,and
a spouse's death-in-service pension equal to two-thirds of
the prospective pension at normal retirement age. Children's
allowances are also payable,usually up to the age of 18.
Spouses' pensions and children's allowances are also payable
upon death in retirement and death after leaving the Company's
employment with a deferred pension. Pensions are increased
annually by the rise in the Retail Prices Index subject to a
maximum increase of 5% per year in respect of pre 6 April 2006
service and 2.5% per year in respect of service from
6 April 2006.
As a result of the 2006 age discrimination legislation,executive
directors' default retirement age is 65 but they retain any previous
rights they had to retire and draw their pensions without actuarial
reduction for early payment at an earlier age.
Following the changes made to take account of the Pensions
Simplification tax changes which came into effect from April 2006,
UK executives reaching the Lifetime Allowance (LTA) are given
a number of choices as previously reported. These are:
- remain in the pension scheme and pay any additional tax
charge; or
- opt out of the pension scheme (and so earn no further pension
benefits in respect of future service) and instead receive a
taxable salary supplement. This supplement will be 30% of
salary and 20% of salary for those senior executives with a
two-thirds salary target after at least 20 years' and 30 years'
service,respectively; or
- restrict scheme benefits to the value of the LTA with the
remainder being provided directly from the Company as an
unfunded promise. At retirement,the unfunded Company
benefits can be either taken as pension or commuted in full
for a taxable lump sum.
The Committee reviews these arrangements each year in the
light of developing market practice and believes they remain
appropriate as they provide executives with competitive pension
benefits and choices for dealing with the LTA which may better
suit their needs whilst being broadly cost neutral to the Company,
are in line with market practice and do not compensate executives
for changes in taxation.
Ian King is a member of the BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan
(the 2000 Plan),applicable to former employees of Marconi
Electronic Systems (MES),and a member of the ExPS with a
normal retirement age of 62. The 2000 Plan provides a pension
of 1/50th of Final Pensionable Earnings (FPE) for each year of
pensionable service,payable from a normal retirement age of 65,
and members pay contributions of 8% of Pensionable Earnings.
FPE under the 2000 Plan is the best three-year average of base
salary and bonus in the ten Plan Years prior to leaving,less an
offset for State pensions. The Company decided in 2006 to limit
pensionable bonuses in the 2000 Plan in the 2006/07 Plan Year

DIRECTORS' REPORT: GOVERNANCE
Remuneration report continued
84 www.baesystems.com BAE Systems Annual Report 2008 85 BAE Systems Annual Report 2008 85
to 20% of base salary and to 10% of base salary for the 2007/08
Plan Year and thereafter. However,there is a guarantee that the
FPE figure for benefits in respect of service prior to 6 April 2007
will not be less than the FPE figure at 5 April 2007 to ensure that
employees do not lose the benefit of contributions paid on past
bonuses. Ian King joined the ExPS in 1999 following the BAe/MES
merger. Therefore Ian King's total pension is the sum of his 2000
Plan benefits plus the top-up from the ExPS.
George Rose is a member of the BAE Systems Pension Scheme
paying contributions of 9.29% of base salary,and is a member
of the ExPS with a normal retirement age of 60. George Rose was
affected by the previously applicable Inland Revenue earnings cap
on approved pensions and has an unapproved (ie non-tax qualified)
pension arrangement to top up his benefits from the approved
schemes. This was designed so that the total pension from all
sources would be broadly in line with the pension he would have
received from the Group pension schemes had he not been subject
to the earnings cap. The Pension Simplification tax changes
allowed the flexibility to remove the earnings cap for George
Rose in respect of service from April 2006, although some of
his benefits will remain to be provided by means of an unfunded
promise from the Company. No further contributions will be paid
into his funded unapproved top-up arrangement.
US pension benefits
Walt Havenstein is a member of the BAE Systems Employees'
Retirement Plan which provides a pension from age 60 for each year
of pensionable service of 1.25% on his Final Average Pay (FAP) up to
Social Security Covered Compensation (circa $70,000) plus 1.5% on
his FAP in excess of Social Security Covered Compensation. FAP is
currently the highest three-year average of base salary plus bonus
(which for pension purposes is limited from 2008 to a maximum
of 150% of base salary) but the averaging period will increase by
one year each year beginning in 2009 and reaching a ten-year
average in 2015. Executive directors pay contributions at the same
rates as other employees in the plan,being 1.5% of earnings. The
pension does not carry any spouse's pension or pension increases.
Walt Havenstein also receives a 50% match on his contributions
to his 401(k) plan up to a maximum contribution of 8% of earnings.
Details of post-retirement benefits for each of the executive
directors who served during 2008 are shown in Table D on page
93 and are calculated in accordance with the requirements of
Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985.
Other benefits
Other benefits provided to the executive directors include a car
allowance,the taxable benefit of any private use of a chauffeur-
driven car and a cash allowance for medical examination.
Ian King was provided with Company support in 2008 to relocate
his flat to central London as detailed in the notes to Table C on
page 92.
Executive directors' service contracts
It is the Committee's policy that executive directors should
normally have service contracts that provide for the Company
to give the individual 12 months' notice of termination. This
policy has been chosen because it provides a reasonable balance
between the need to retain the services of key individuals and
the need to limit the liabilities of the Company in the event of
the termination of a contract. The executive directors have
service contracts with Group companies and details of these
are shown below.
Date of contract Unexpired term Notice period
Walt Havenstein 1 December 2006 3 months 3 months
either party
Ian King 27 June 2008 12 months 12 months
either party
George Rose 16 November 1998 12 months 12 months
(amended: from the
3 December 1999 Company,
15 January 2004 6 months
and from the
17 October 2005) individual
In the event of the termination of an executive director's contract
it is the Committee's policy to seek to limit any payment made
in lieu of notice to a payment equal to the amount of one year's
base salary. The service contracts for all of the executive directors
contain specific provisions to the effect that the Company has the
right,and in Walt Havenstein's case,generally has the obligation,to
pay a sum equivalent to 12 months' salary (plus the continuation
of 18 months' medical benefits in Walt Havenstein's case) in the
event of the Company terminating their contracts for reasons other
than gross misconduct. No executive director has provisions in his
service contract that relate to a change of control of the Company
(and neither does the Chairman nor the non-executive directors in
their respective letters of appointment).
Retirement arrangements for Mike Turner
Mike Turner was employed under a service contract dated
22 February 1994 (amended 30 May 1995,3 December 1999,
8 May 2002,15 January 2004 and 14 October 2005) and,as
announced on 16 October 2007,he stepped down and retired
from the Company at the end of August 2008. The termination
arrangements were set out in a termination agreement and
disclosed in last year's report.
On leaving the Company at the end of August 2008,he received
a termination payment of  236,884 in respect of his contractual
and statutory rights relating to the unserved portion of his 12-
month notice period to 16 October 2008,and an immediate
pension of  524,063 pa and tax free lump sum of  1,637,488
as set out in Table D on page 93,calculated in accordance with
the rules of the schemes.
He also received a payment due in respect of his 2008 annual
bonus as set out in Table C on page 92 and his special incentive
vested in full as set out on page 81 of this report. His other share
plan interests were dealt with as disclosed in last year's report
and summarised in the notes on page 91.
Policy on external board appointments
The long-standing policy of allowing executive directors to hold
external non-BAE Systems-related non-executive directorships with
the prior approval of the Committee will continue. The Committee
considers that external directorships provide the Company's
senior executives with valuable experience that is of benefit to
BAE Systems. It is also considered appropriate for BAE Systems
to contribute to the pool of non-executive expertise available for
the benefit of the wider business community,thereby reciprocating
the benefit that it in turn has received from other organisations
which have permitted members of their senior management teams
to serve on the BAE Systems Board. The Committee believes that it is reasonable for the individual executive director to retain
any fees received from such appointments given the additional
personal responsibility that this entails. Such fees retained by the
executive directors in 2008 for the period in which they served
on the BAE Systems Board were as follows: Ian King  32,691;
George Rose  82,500; and Mike Turner  49,785 plus grants
of Deferred Stock Units to the value of  72,766.
Chairman's appointment,term and fees
Dick Olver was appointed Chairman on 1 July 2004. His
appointment was for an initial fixed three-year term with effect from
17 May 2004 (the date that he was appointed to the Board as a
non-executive director) and was extended by the Board in 2007,
on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee (as chaired
by Sir Peter Mason,the Senior Independent Director),for a second
term of three years to 16 May 2010 unless terminated earlier in
accordance with the Company's Articles of Association,or by either
party giving the other not less than six months' prior written notice.
His appointment is documented in a letter of appointment which is
not a contract of employment and he is required to devote no fewer
than two days a week to his duties as Chairman. His appointment
as Chairman will automatically terminate if he ceases to be a
director of the Company. His fee for the second three-year term,
which has been set by the Committee at  600,000 per annum,
will not be subject to review during the three-year term.
Non-executive directors' appointment,
term and fees
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts but
do have letters of appointment detailing the basis of their
appointment. The dates of their original appointment were
as follows:
Non-executive director Date of appointment Expiry of current term*
Phil Carroll 07.09.2005 06.09.2009

* Subject to re-election at the AGM following their appointment and subsequently at
intervals of no more than three years in accordance with the Company's Articles
of Association.
The non-executive directors are normally appointed for two
consecutive three-year terms subject to review after the end of
the first three-year period and with any third term of three years
being subject to rigorous review and taking into account the need
progressively to refresh the Board. They do not have periods of
notice and the Company has no obligation to pay compensation
when their appointment terminates. They are subject to re-election
at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) following their appointment
and subsequently at intervals of no more than three years. Peter
Weinberg retired from the Board on 7 May 2008 at the conclusion
of the 2008 AGM having originally been appointed to the Board
on 16 June 2005.
Non-executive directors are proposed by the Nominations
Committee and are appointed by the Board on the basis of
their experience to provide independent judgement on issues
of strategy,performance,resources and standards of conduct.
The letters of appointment for non-executive directors detail
the amount of time it is anticipated that the individual will need
to devote to his or her duties as a director,being 15 days per
year plus additional commitment for chairing a committee or
undertaking the role of Senior Independent Director. The level of
their fees is set by the Non-Executive Directors' Fees Committee
to reflect this time commitment and responsibility,and after
reviewing practice in other comparable companies.
Having reviewed the time commitments required and the market
competitive positioning,a number of changes have been made to
the structure of fees payable to non-executive directors for 2009.
- The base fee has been increased by 4.8% from  63,000
to  66,000.
- The total time commitment and additional fee for chairing the
Audit,Corporate Responsibility and Remuneration committees
have been aligned at around 25 days and at  20,000,
respectively.
Committee 2008 fee* 2009 fee*
Audit Committee  20,000  20,000
Corporate Responsibility Committee  15,000  20,000
Remuneration Committee  15,000  20,000
- The time commitment and additional fee for the responsibilities
of being Senior Independent Director have been aligned to those
for the committee chairmen. The Senior Independent Director
is not a chairman of one of the above three committees.
- The previous transatlantic meeting allowance of  4,000 has
been replaced by a travel allowance of  4,000 per meeting on
each occasion that a non-executive director's attendance at a
Board meeting necessitates air travel of more than five hours
(one-way) to the meeting location. For 2009,a maximum of six
travel allowances will be payable.
The table below summarises the fee structure for 2008 and 2009.
Non-executive director 2008 fee* 2009 fee*
Chairman Audit Committee  83,000  86,000

for any three-year period over the ten-year option life exceeded the
sum of inflation for that period and real growth of 9% was achieved.
PSP
TSR
- nil vesting if the Company's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) at
the end of the three-year performance period is outside the top 50% of
TSRs achieved by a sectoral comparator group; 25% vesting if TSR is at
median (50%); and 100% vesting if TSR is in the top 20%,with vesting
on a straight-line basis between these two points.
PSP
EPS
- proportion of the award exercisable is determined by the rate of
annual actual EPS growth over the three-year performance period,with nil
vesting at annual actual EPS growth of 5% or less,100% vesting at 11%
growth,and vesting on a straight-line basis between these two points.
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
A full description of the PSP is set out on pages 82 and 83. PSP awards granted since 2008 attract dividends prior to vesting.
Awards that vest at the end of year three are exercisable in three tranches at the end of years three,four and five.
Executive Share Option Plan (ExSOP)

Share price information
The mid-market price for the Company's ordinary shares at 31 December 2008 was 376.75p (2007 498p). The range during the year was 302.5p
to 507p.
Aggregate amount of gains made by directors
The aggregate amount of gains made by directors from the exercise of share options in 2008,as calculated at the date of exercise,was  6,278,313
(2007  14,882,281). The net aggregate value of assets received by directors in 2008 from long-term incentive plans,as calculated at the date of
vesting,was  1,931,858 (2007  1,066,284).
Rationale for key performance measures for PSP,ExSOP and SMP
EPS - importance to major investors as a key indicator of long-term financial performance and value creation.
TSR (and secondary financial measure) - importance to major investors as an indication of both earnings and capital growth relative to major
companies in the same sector,and to ensure that awards only vest if there has been a clear improvement in the Company's performance over
the relevant period.
Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
Replaced by the SMP in 2007.
The matching award of shares under the RSP (under which awards have not been granted since 2006) was historically not subject to performance
criteria as it was designed to retain key staff and encourage executives to re-invest in Company shares the cash bonuses that they had earned under
the annual bonus plan which was itself subject to performance conditions.
Share Matching Plan (SMP) - matching shares
A full description of the SMP is set out on page 83. SMP awards attract dividends prior to vesting.
2008 award - nil match for actual EPS growth of 5% pa or less,increasing uniformly to a 1:1 match for 8% pa growth.
2007 award - nil vesting for real EPS growth pa of less than 3% over the three-year performance period,with one-third of the matched award vesting
on average real EPS growth pa of 3% but less than 4%,two-thirds vesting with a growth rate of 4% but less than 5%,and full vesting at growth of 5%
or over. Table B continued

In addition,Walt Havenstein has a cash-settled Stock Appreciation Right (SAR) over 53,010 ordinary shares granted on 27 November 2000 at a
SAR price of  3.73,exercisable from 27 November 2003 until 27 November 2010. This was exercisable only if growth in pre-exceptional EPS for
any three-year period over the ten-year life exceeded the sum of inflation for that period and a growth requirement of 9%,which was met.
Note: Awards granted to Walt Havenstein (a US national) under the PSP are technically characterised as long-term incentives rather than options as,
subject to the attainment of the performance condition,they are delivered automatically on the third,fourth and fifth anniversary of grant without the
need to exercise an option. They are shown in the top portion of the table for ease of comparison. Gains on delivered PSP awards for Walt Havenstein
are included in the directors' gains on LTIPs figure on page 89 whilst PSP gains for the other directors are included in the share option gains figure.
The 2003-2005 PSP awards and 2005 ExSOP options granted to Walt Havenstein are granted under the Stock Appreciation Rights Schedule to those
plans. The exercise price referred to for the latter is the SAR price. BAE Systems Annual Report 2008 91 BAE Systems Annual Report 2008 91

1 Retired as a director on 31 August 2008.
2 As at 31 August 2008,the date of Mike Turner's retirement,options outstanding totalled 1,068,979 under the PSP and 1,045,476 under ExSOP, and awards outstanding totalled 203,790
under the SMP, nil under the RSP and 231,618 under the PSA.
3 The SMP and PSA awards which vested on 1 September 2008 attracted reinvested dividends which equated on vesting to an additional 4,746 and 3,255 shares,respectively. The market
price on vesting was  4.78. The value of the related gain is included in the figure for the aggregate gain from long-term incentive plans on page 89.
Treatment of options and awards on retirement
As disclosed in last year's report,the treatment of Mike Turner's
outstanding options and awards at his retirement on 31 August 2008
was as follows:
- unexercised options under ExSOP were preserved and exercisable in
full within 12 months of his retirement. Any performance condition that
remained to be satisfied was waived;
- PSP awards already vested (awards granted in 2005 and earlier)
were preserved and exercisable within six months of retirement;
- unvested PSP awards (awards granted in 2006 and 2007): the
performance condition will be tested at the end of the normal three-
year performance period,will vest to the extent that the performance
condition has been met,and will be exercisable within six months.
The number of shares that vest will not be pro-rated to reflect his
actual service during the applicable three-year periods;
- unvested 2007 matching SMP award: the performance condition was
tested at retirement; the award vested in full and was not time pro-
rated; and
- unvested 2008 matching SMP award: the performance condition will be
tested in February 2009 and the quantum of the award vesting will not
be time pro-rated.
Performance Share Award (PSA) - Performance condition
Mike Turner was granted a contingent award over 231,618 shares
on 16 October 2007 under which the shares would vest in two equal
tranches in the year following his retirement on 31 August 2008,subject
to the satisfaction of certain performance targets by 31 August 2008.
These targets,which were fully met,related to continuing the successful
implementation of the Company's business strategy,satisfaction of
leadership objectives set by the Remuneration Committee,achieving an
orderly handover of key external relationships and facilitating an orderly
succession to the Chief Executive role. The Committee believed that this
was the most appropriate incentive in relation to his period of service
to retirement. The first tranche of shares under award was released
on 1 September 2008; the second tranche will be released in 2009. Table C

* Normal Retirement Age.
1 Accrued pensions may be reduced if they are taken before the normal retirement age of the scheme. In addition,a longevity adjustment factor applies
to UK pension accrued after 5 April 2006.
2 Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with GN11 issued by the actuarial profession. For UK-based directors the assumptions are the
same as those used in the calculation of cash equivalents from the schemes. For US-based directors the assumptions are the same as those used
for accounting disclosures. The amount of the increase in transfer value arising from the change in assumptions is: Walt Havenstein ( nil); Ian King
( 965,915); George Rose ( 514,150); Mike Turner ( 408,201).
3 Walt Havenstein's accrued pension comprises  21,856 from a contributory Qualified Plan and  134,615 from Non-Qualified Plans. In addition,Walt
Havenstein participates in a Section 401(k) defined contribution arrangement set up for US employees in which the Company will match employee
contributions up to a limit. In 2008 the Company paid contributions of $6,402 ( 4,413) into this 401(k) arrangement. In addition,the Company paid
$42,395 ( 29,224) into a Deferred Compensation arrangement. Walt Havenstein is paid in US dollars. Of the change in the accrued benefit and the
transfer value  42,296 and  471,786 respectively is due to currency movements.
4 George Rose has an unapproved retirement arrangement for pensionable service before 5 April 2006 that is partly funded and partly unfunded.
No Company contributions have been made to these arrangements during the year.
5 As a result of the changes to taxation of pensions introduced in April 2006 Mike Turner elected to opt out of the pension scheme and since April 2006
had been receiving a taxable salary supplement of 30% of his base salary. Mike Turner retired from the Board on 31 August 2008 and started to draw
his pension of  524,063 pa after having exchanged part of his pension for a tax-free cash lump sum of  1,637,488. The transfer value as at
31 December 2008 allows for this exchange of pension for tax-free cash.
Sir Peter Gershon and Richard Lapthorne,both former directors,have unfunded pension arrangements. In 2008 the Company paid Sir Peter Gershon a
cash lump sum of  334,805 and pension of  18,188 and Richard Lapthorne a pension of  119,279 (2007  93,554) in respect of these arrangements.
