REMUNERATION REPORT
Remuneration strategy, 
policy and packages
Following the annual review in November 2011, the Committee 
concluded that the current remuneration strategy remains generally 
appropriate, but the following key changes have been introduced:
 - to further emphasise the importance of financial performance, the 
financial element of the annual incentive plan is being increased 
from two-thirds to four-fifths, with the one-fifth non-financial element 
being split equally between corporate responsibility objectives and 
personal objectives. The financial element will be targeted on 
earnings and cash, each with an equal weighting, and a substantial 
part of the personal objectives element will be focused on winning 
new business; and
 - to achieve optimal alignment of the reward framework with the 
creation of shareholder value, shareholder approval is being sought 
at the AGM to introduce a Share Option Plan in place of half of the 
current expected value of the Performance Share Plan (PSP), with 
the awards made to the executive directors being subject to a T otal 
Shareholder Return (TSR) performance condition.
Other than these changes, the Committee intends to continue with 
the executive remuneration policy as detailed in this report in 2012 
and subsequent years for executive directors and Executive 
Committee members, and this policy will be flowed down to the most 
senior executives within the Group globally (approximately 280) to 
create a consistent global approach to reward. The principles of the 
remuneration strategy are applied consistently across the Group 
below this level, taking account of seniority and local market practice.
The Committee will continue to consult on material changes with 
principal shareholders.
The Committee has considered the UK Corporate Governance Code 
requirement regarding remuneration incentives being compatible with 
risk policies and systems, and continues to be satisfied that the 
Company is well placed to meet this requirement as profit recognition 
on long-term programmes is intrinsically linked to risk reduction.
REMUNERATION STRATEGY
The Company' s remuneration strategy is to provide a remuneration 
package that:
 - helps to attract, retain and motivate;
 - is aligned to shareholders' interests;
 - is competitive against the appropriate market;
 - encourages and supports a T otal Performance culture aligned to 
the achievement of the Company' s strategic objectives;
 - is fair and transparent; 
 - can be applied consistently throughout the Group; and
 - balances overall commonality of design with appropriate tailoring to 
ensure competitiveness in our different principal markets.
REMUNERATION POLICY
T o achieve the strategy, the remuneration policy for executive directors 
and Executive Committee members is to:
 - set base salary with reference to median of the relevant market 
competitive level;
 - reward stretching superior performance with upper quartile reward;
 - provide an appropriate balance between:
 - short-term and long-term reward; and
 - fixed and variable reward
with the balance becoming more long term and more highly 
geared with seniority; and
 - provide a competitive package of benefits.
ELEMENTS OF P ACKAGE PURPOSE
Base salary Recognise market value of role and individual' s skills, experience and performance.
Annual incentive Drive and reward annual performance of individuals, teams and the Company on both financial and 
non-financial metrics, including behaviours.
Share Matching Plan Directly align short-term and long-term reward through compulsory deferral of annual incentive into 
shares, and drive and reward delivery of sustained long-term Earnings per Share (EPS) performance 
through co-investment aligned to the interests of shareholders.
Performance Share Plan Drive and reward delivery of sustained long-term EPS and TSR performance aligned to the interests 
of shareholders.
Share Option Plan Drive and reward delivery of TSR performance and sustained improvement in the Company' s share price.
Restricted Share Plan Provide long-term reward and address retention issues, through time-vesting awards principally in the 
Company' s US market.
Pension provision and other 
benefits
Provide competitive cost-effective retirement plans and other employee benefits through leveraging the 
Company' s size and scale. 82 BAE Systems Annual Report 2011
2011 remuneration review
The 2011 review not only considered the Company' s executive 
remuneration packages against the market, but also the Company' s 
performance to date and the strategic actions designed to shape the 
business portfolio and strengthen performance over the longer term.
Information on the market for comparable management positions was 
provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers so that the Committee could 
form a view as to where to position the various elements of the 
package relative to comparable companies.
The methodology used was to construct appropriate comparator 
groups for the individual positions, taking account of company size, 
scale of operations and breadth of role. The comparator group for the 
UK executive directors comprises 24 FTSE 100 companies where 
BAE  Systems is positioned towards the median in terms of market 
capitalisation and which the Committee believes is appropriate for 
benchmarking UK executive directors' packages.
For the President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc., the 
comparator group was drawn from companies in the US aerospace, 
defence and general industry sector , adjusted, as appropriate, to 
produce market figures consistent with the size, scale and relative 
independence of the US business, and adjusting where necessary to 
reflect the extra responsibility for her plc Board role.
The base salary, total cash reward (base salary plus annual incentive), 
total direct reward (total cash reward plus long-term incentives) and 
total reward (total direct reward plus pension) were analysed at the 
lower quartile, median and upper quartile for the relevant posts in the 
comparator group companies. This gives the Committee a view on the 
competitiveness of the individual elements of the package as well as 
the package as a whole.
The Committee also reviewed market trends around the individual 
elements of remuneration to ensure that the structure of the package 
stays in line with market practice. The remuneration structure overall 
also takes account of the performance of the individual, the Company 
as a whole, and the pay and conditions of Group employees.
Overall, while the review indicated that the structure is broadly in line 
with the market, some adjustments, particularly in respect of the 
overall market-competitiveness of the packages for our senior 
executives in the US, were deemed necessary to ensure that it 
remained so. 
Base salary
The Committee reviewed base salaries, taking into account the 
current economic climate, the challenges facing the business, their 
respective positions against benchmark, and the pay environment for 
employees in general. In particular , the salary of the Group Finance 
Director has been increased by 5% as his salary was below market on 
appointment to the role in April 2011. 
The annual base salary levels of executive directors with effect from 
1 January 2012 are as follows:
Name 2011 salary 2012 salary Increase
Ian King  935,000  963,050 3.0%
Peter Lynas  520,000  546,000 5.0%
Linda Hudson $1,010,000 $1,045,350 3.5%
Incentives
The Group' s strategy is set out on page 6 along with the Group 
Strategic Framework. This explains how the Group' s mission is to 
deliver sustainable growth in shareholder value through its 
commitment to T otal Performance - Customer Focus, Programme 
Execution, Financial Performance and Responsible Behaviour . 
Underpinning the drive for T otal Performance are the Group' s Values 
- T rusted, Innovative and Bold. The Group' s strategy focuses on 
supporting its customers in safeguarding their vital interests, and 
driving shareholder value by improving financial performance and 
competitive positions across the business. The five Strategic Actions, 
which translate the strategy into operational plans, are underpinned 
by the Integrated Business Plan (IBP), which sets out the business 
plan for future years.
Each year , the Board agrees the Executive Committee' s key objectives 
which are critical to delivering the Group' s strategy. For 2012, these 
are set out on page 6, and are used as the basis to set the individual 
objectives for the executive directors and Executive Committee 
members which are agreed by the Chairman, Dick Olver , and the 
Remuneration Committee. These then flow down to the senior 
leadership team to ensure that all businesses within the Group are 
aligned with the overall Group strategy.
The remuneration strategy incentivises and rewards executives to 
deliver their contribution to the achievement of the Group' s strategy 
through the combination of short-term incentives targeted at Group 
performance, business performance, personal performance and 
leadership behaviours, and long-term incentives targeted at Group 
performance (and business performance in the case of our US senior 
executives). T o directly align short-term and long-term reward, 
executive directors will be required to invest at least one-third of their 
net 2012 annual incentive into the SMP when the annual incentive is 
paid in 2013. Further investment can be made on a voluntary basis up 
to a maximum investment of half their net annual incentive, except in 
the case of the US executive director who participates in the 
Restricted Share Plan following its approval by shareholders at the 
2011 AGM.
Annual incentive plan
The annual incentives for 2012 continue to focus on a combination of 
in-year financial performance, and longer-term performance and risk 
management (both business risk and reputation risk). Four-fifths is 
driven off in-year financial performance, and one-fifth based on driving 
performance and improvement in the area of corporate responsibility 
and safety, combined with the other non-financial objectives 
supporting the Group' s strategy.
The financial targets are derived from the IBP , and are based on 
earnings and cash targets, each with equal weighting. These are seen 
as the key indicators of both short-term and long-term financial 
performance and value creation, and are supported by the Company' s 
major shareholders. At Group level, EPS is used whereas EBITA
1
 is 
used to measure earnings performance at a business level. T o 
incentivise improved phasing of cash generation throughout the year , 
a combination of year-end and average quarterly net cash/debt has 
been in place since 2009 and will continue for 2012. Due to the 
stretching nature of the plan, and following the introduction in 2010 of 
a threshold paying 20% of maximum for the profit element, a threshold 
payout of 20% of maximum will apply in 2012 for all financial 
performance measures. The payout for on-target performance is 50% 
of maximum. Payout for performance between targets is calculated on 
a straight-line basis.
The table below summarises the overall structure of the annual 
incentives for executive directors.
Proportion of annual incentive
Performance measure 2011 2012
In-year financial 66.7% 80.0%
Business conduct and safety 15.0% -
Corporate responsibility and safety - 10.0%
Other objectives 18.3% 10.0%
In setting targets for the annual incentive plan, the Committee 
expects that these should represent positive progression relative to 
the level of performance achieved in the prior year .
The Committee believes that the annual incentive targets for the 
executive directors are stretching but achievable. The structure of the 
2012 annual incentive plan for executive directors is summarised in 
their individual sections on pages 84 to 86.

Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs)
The Company currently operates two LTIPs - the Performance Share 
Plan (PSP) and the Share Matching Plan (SMP), the details of which 
are set out on pages 88 to 90. In addition, following shareholder 
approval at the 2011 AGM, the US executives participate in the 
Restricted Share Plan (RSP) which provides approximately 35% of the 
total LTIP package without performance conditions other than time 
vesting. Further detail on the RSP is contained on page 90.
In order to ensure the package remains competitive, a number of 
structural changes are proposed to the LTIP framework for 2012, 
specifically:
 - in order to strengthen the link between absolute share price 
improvement and reward outcomes, one half of the current 
expected value of the PSP will be delivered in the form of grants 
under a new Share Option Plan, subject to receiving shareholder 
approval of this at the 2012 AGM. The combined face value of 
awards under the PSP and the new Share Option Plan will be 
calculated in such a way as to ensure no increase to the overall 
expected value of the LTIP package; and
 - despite the changes introduced in 2011 to the long-term incentive 
package applicable to the President and Chief Executive Officer of 
BAE Systems, Inc., the 2011 remuneration review highlighted that 
there continues to be a significant gap between the current 
incumbent' s total direct remuneration opportunity and what is 
required for this to be competitive against compensation levels for 
a US divisional lead in the US defence and aerospace market. The 
Committee has addressed this by increasing the aggregated 
 expected value' of the long-term incentive applicable to the 
President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc. to 300% 
of salary. A corresponding increase in the minimum shareholding 
requirement for the President and Chief Executive Officer of 
BAE  Systems, Inc. from 200% to 350% of salary will also apply for 
2012 onwards.
The combination of the annual incentive plan, SMP , PSP and share 
options provides a balance between short-term cash reward and 
longer-term share-based reward as shown below. The proportion of 
the incentive package delivered through longer-term performance is 
significantly higher at stretch payout than at on-target payout, 
demonstrating that the package supports the achievement of 
superior long-term performance and strongly aligns the interests of 
executives to those of shareholders through long-term reward being 
delivered in shares. The second graph shows which performance 
metrics are driving the value of the incentives. This shows that, at 
on-target performance, the higher influence of the annual incentive 
means that in-year measures drive around 40% of the package value, 
with long-term EPS (which underpins the SMP and half the PSP 
awards) accounting for a similar proportion. But, at stretch 
performance, the influence of the annual incentive is reduced, and the 
SMP , PSP and share options account between them for four-fifths of 
the value of the incentive package, with the most important drivers of 
value becoming long-term EPS and share price. This shows that 
achieving strong performance on the in-year measures is important 
but, to maximise the value of their incentive package, executives need 
to drive growth in long-term EPS and share price.

Personal shareholding policy 
The Committee has agreed a policy whereby all executive directors are 
required to establish and maintain a minimum personal shareholding 
equal to 200% of base salary (350% in the case of the President and 
Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc.). As a minimum, a holding 
equal to 100% (175% for the President and Chief Executive Officer of 
BAE Systems, Inc.) of base salary must be achieved as quickly as 
possible using shares vesting or options exercised through the 
executive share option schemes or long-term incentive schemes, by 
using 50% of the shares that vest or 50% of the options which are 
exercised on each occasion. Thereafter , executive directors are 
required to increase their personal shareholding gradually, on each 
occasion using 25% of the shares that vest or 25% of the options 
exercised each year , until a personal shareholding equal to 200% of 
annual base salary (350% for the President and Chief Executive 
Officer of BAE Systems, Inc.) is achieved and maintained. These limits 
are reviewed periodically. A similar arrangement applies to senior 
executives eligible for share-based long-term incentives with limits 
aligned to the levels of awards made under these plans.
Details of the directors' personal shareholdings are shown in T able A 
on page 94.
Pension provision
No changes to the pension arrangements for executive directors were 
made in 2011. Further detail on current arrangements is provided on 
page 91. 84 BAE Systems Annual Report 2011

Performance in 2011
The structure of the 2011 annual incentive plan was set out in last year' s Remuneration report and is summarised in the individual sections 
for each of the executive directors on pages 84 to 86 of this report.
Financial performance: Against the backdrop of a difficult business environment and the Group' s strong performance in recent years, 2011 
was particularly challenging. At the Group level, EPS was close to stretch performance, year-end cash was above target and the stretch target 
for average cash was achieved. As referred to on page 14, the Group' s order intake performance was below target. At the operating group level, 
Programmes & Support missed its stretch profit target, achieved stretch performance on both cash targets, but missed the order intake 
target. International achieved its stretch profit target, missed year-end cash targets, delivered on-target performance for average cash, but 
missed the order intake target. BAE Systems, Inc. achieved stretch performance for both cash targets, achieved between threshold and 
on-target levels for EBITA
1
, but missed order intake targets. For incentive purposes, the effect of the research and development tax credit on 
EPS performance was limited to reflect prior year impacts only. 
Non-financial performance: Page 13 sets out the Executive Committee' s top ten objectives for 2011 and the assessment of performance 
against these, whilst pages 55 to 59 provide more detailed information on the performance against the specific objectives relating to 
business conduct and safety.
Business conduct: The Group targeted the successful implementation of the 23 recommendations of the Woolf Committee which was 
completed in May 2011. Deloitte has assured BAE Systems' statements on  Progress against Recommendations' on the Group' s website. 
Safety: The Group has continued to drive improvement of safety management, using its Safety Maturity Matrix (SMM) as the mechanism to 
measure and drive performance. Within BAE Systems, Inc. and Programmes & Support all sites designated to achieve Level 5 (highest level) 
were confirmed as having achieved this. Australia did not meet its plan to achieve Level 5 at its nominated sites. The Group achieved an 11% 
reduction in Lost Work Day Case Rate which did not meet the target of 20% set by the Corporate Responsibility Committee. 
Other objectives: Of the remaining top ten Group objectives for 2011, good progress has been made and the Committee agreed an overall 
assessment of 75% of maximum. This sets the starting point with further adjustment, up or down, depending on the assessment of overall 
performance and leadership behavioural performance of the individual executive.
Accordingly, the Committee determined the payout under the 2011 annual incentive plan as follows:
2011 annual incentive payout Ian King Linda Hudson Peter Lynas
% of target 137.2% 131.2% 139.0%
% of base salary 154.4% 147.6% 104.3%
Amount  1,443,383$1,490,621 406,731
In addition:
 - the growth in EPS over the three years to 2011 was approximately 7.57% pa. Consequently:
 - the SMP award granted in 2009 earned a 0.85 match; and
 - of the 50% of the awards of shares granted in March 2009 under the EPS portion of the PSP , 42.42% vest.
 - the Company' s TSR for the 50% of awards of shares granted in March 2009 under the TSR portion of the PSP was below the median position 
when compared against the comparator group of 18 other defence and aerospace companies, and the related awards accordingly lapsed.

and will operate for grants under the Share Option Plan from its inception. The arrangements are intended to cover situations, for example, 
where results are restated or otherwise turn out to be materially inaccurate or where the executive' s employment can be terminated for cause.
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN (PSP)
Key features for PSP awards in 2012:
 - awards of shares are granted based on a percentage of salary and share price at the date of grant;
 - the shares are subject to satisfaction of three-year performance conditions;
 - half the PSP award will be based on a T otal Shareholder Return (TSR) performance condition (PSP
TSR
) and the other half on an Earnings per 
Share (PSP
EPS
) performance condition. For US participants, the first half of the award will be based on long-term operating cash performance 
measured at the level of the US businesses, reflecting an increased emphasis from shareholders on cash flow generation;
 - in addition, there is a further test on the PSP
TSR
 element to ensure that the TSR performance is supported by the underlying performance of 
the Company;
 - shares under award after satisfaction of the performance condition vest at the end of year three. Awards that vest are exercisable in three 
tranches between the third and seventh anniversary of vesting. For US participants, the awards are automatically delivered at the end of 
years three, four and five, subject to the performance condition being achieved; and
 - shares under award attract dividends prior to vesting.

PERFORMANCE CONDITION - PSP
EPS
The proportion of the award capable of exercise is determined by the 
rate of average annual EPS growth over the three-year performance 
period, with nil vesting at average annual EPS growth of 5% and 100% 
vesting at 11% growth as set out opposite (15% to 33% growth over 
three years).
The rationale for the EPS performance measure is that major 
investors consider EPS to be a key indicator of long-term financial 
performance and value creation.
Summary of EPS performance to 31 December 2011
2011 EPS was 45.4p, and is approximately 7.57% greater (per 
annum) than the 2008 EPS of 37.0p. This is just below the mid-point 
of the performance range of 5% to 11% growth per annum. 
Accordingly, 42.42% of the EPS portion of the March 2009 PSP 
awards vest.

PERFORMANCE CONDITION - PSP
TSR
The proportion of the award capable of exercise is determined by:
(i)   the Company' s TSR (share price growth plus dividends) ranking 
relative to a comparator group of 12 other international defence 
companies as shown in the table opposite*. Reflecting the 
Group' s strategy to transition from a more diversified portfolio, 
the composition of the comparator group has changed to 
comprise those companies with a significant focus on defence 
and security. None of the shares vest if the Company' s TSR is 
outside the top 50% of TSRs achieved by the sectoral comparator 
group, with 25% vesting at median, and 100% vesting if it is in the 
top quintile (i.e. top 20%) as set out opposite; and
(ii)   whether there has been a sustained improvement in the 
Company' s underlying financial performance and whether it is 
appropriate to release some or all of the awards. In taking such a 
view, the Committee may consider (but not exclusively) the 
following financial metrics: net cash/debt; EBITA
1
; order book; 
turnover; risk; and underlying project performance.
The rationale for TSR performance measures is that major investors 
regard TSR as an important indication of both earnings and capital 
growth relative to other major companies in the same sector and to 
ensure that awards only vest if there has been a clear improvement in 
the Company' s performance over the relevant period.

SHARE MATCHING PLAN (SMP)
Key features for grants of awards in 2012:
 - stand-alone share investment plan with the investment linked to 
the  award under the annual incentive plan;
 - participants are granted a conditional award of matching shares 
against the gross value of the annual incentive invested;
 - matching shares attract dividends during the three-year deferral 
period, released on vesting of any matching shares;
 - executive directors are required to invest one-third of their 2011 
net  annual incentive into the SMP; and
 - maximum level of investment will be 50% of the net annual 
incentive.
Match and performance condition
 - nil match for average EPS growth of 5% per annum increasing 
uniformly to a 1:1 match at 8% per annum and a maximum 2:1 
match at 11% per annum growth (i.e. 15% to 33% growth over 
three years).
 - Rationale for performance measure: major investors consider 
EPS  to be a key indicator of long-term financial performance 
and  value creation.

approximately 7.57% greater (per annum) than the 2008 EPS of 
37.0p. Accordingly, the SMP award granted in 2009 earned a 0.85 
match.
SHARE OPTION PLAN*
Key features for option grants in 2012:
 - options granted under the Share Option Plan are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of their grant; and
 - for share option awards made to the executive directors only, exercise is subject to a TSR performance condition such that:
 - 25% of each option grant is exercisable if the Company' s TSR (share price growth and dividends) is at the median relative to the 
comparator group (using the same 12 companies included in the sectoral peer group for the 2012 PSP
TSR
 performance condition listed 
on  page 89).
 - 100% of each option grant is exercisable if the Company' s TSR (share price growth and dividends) is in the upper quintile relative to the 
comparator group. For performance between median and upper quintile, the proportion of options exercisable will be calculated on a 
straight-line basis.
Rationale for performance measure: major investors regard TSR as an important indication of both earnings and capital growth relative to 
other major companies in the same sector .
* Introduction of the Share Option Plan is subject to shareholder approval at the 2012 AGM. 
RESTRICTED SHARE PLAN (RSP)
Key features of awards in 2012:
 - conditional awards of shares are granted based on a percentage of salary and share price at the date of grant;
 - the shares are subject only to the condition that the participant remains employed by the Group at the end of the vesting date (three years 
after the award date); and
 - shares under award attract dividends prior to vesting.
The RSP is not subject to a performance condition as it is designed to address retention issues principally in the US. 
Clawback arrangements operate in respect of this Plan.  BAE Systems Annual Report 2011 91 
Governance
Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
During 2011, the UK executive directors were eligible to participate in 
the all-employee free shares element of the SIP . As a result of the 
Company' s performance in 2011, all eligible employees (including the 
UK executive directors) will be entitled to receive shares worth  469. 
A similar arrangement operates for non-UK employees on a cash or 
shares basis depending on local tax and security laws.
The Company operates a share purchase arrangement (Partnership 
Shares) under the SIP . Under this arrangement, UK-based employees 
(including executive directors) may purchase ordinary shares in 
BAE  Systems by either monthly investments of between  10 and 
 125 a month, or lump sum investments of between  10 and  1,500 
in a tax year , both limited to 10% of salary if less. The Partnership 
Shares attract matching shares. As the plan is an all-employee plan, 
the matching shares are not subject to performance conditions in 
accordance with legislation. One free matching share is awarded for 
each Partnership Share up to a maximum of  63 per month.
Dividends paid in respect of the shares in the SIP for UK-based 
employees are reinvested as Dividend Shares.
Share usage for employee share schemes 
The Committee has agreed that, in respect of new issue or treasury 
shares, shares representing no more than 1% (and no more than 0.5% 
for the executive schemes) of the Company' s issued share capital will 
be used in any one financial year for the grant of incentives under all of 
the Company' s employee share schemes. The table below sets out 
the available dilution capacity for the Company' s employee share 
schemes on this basis.
The Company currently intends to use new issue or treasury shares to 
satisfy future share awards under the executive long-term incentive 
plans and share option plans up to the 0.5% annual dilution limit, and 
to use treasury shares to satisfy awards of free shares and matching 
shares under the all-employee Share Incentive Plan.
Number of shares
T otal issued share capital as at 31 December 2011 3,588m
All schemes:
10% in any consecutive years 358.8m
Remaining headroom 202.2m
Executive schemes:
5% in any consecutive ten years 179.4m
Remaining headroom 79.2m
Where it is appropriate to use shares purchased in the market to 
satisfy employee share scheme commitments, a discretionary ESOP 
trust is used to acquire Company shares using funds loaned by the 
Group. Further detail on the ESOP T rust is provided in note 25 to the 
Group accounts.
Post-retirement benefits 
UK pension benefits
UK executive directors are members of the BAE Systems Executive 
Pension Scheme (the ExPS) and members of the underlying employee 
pension plans. As such, they are subject to the same contribution 
rates payable by employees of the underlying plans, and the benefit 
changes introduced in 2006 for post-April 2006 service including the 
introduction of the Longevity Adjustment Factor , a reduction in the 
maximum level of pension increases and a change in the definition 
of  Pensionable Pay.
The ExPS tops up the underlying employee plan to provide a target 
benefit for executive directors payable from normal retirement age 
of  1/30th of Final Pensionable Pay (FPP) for each year of ExPS 
pensionable service (subject to a maximum of two-thirds of FPP). 
FPP  is defined as annual base salary averaged over the last 12 
months prior to leaving service in respect of service accrued to 5  April 
2006 and 36 months prior to leaving in respect of service from 6  April 
2006. The ExPS also provides a lump sum death-in-service benefit 
equal to four times base salary at date of death, and a spouse' s 
death-in-service pension equal to two-thirds of the prospective 
pension at normal retirement age. Children' s allowances are also 
payable, usually up to the age of 18. Spouses' pensions and 
children' s allowances are also payable upon death in retirement and 
death after leaving the Company' s employment with a deferred 
pension. Once in payment, pensions are increased annually by the 
rise in the Retail Price Index subject to a maximum increase of 5% per 
year in respect of pre-6 April 2006 service and 2.5% per year in 
respect of service from 6 April 2006.
As a result of the 2006 age discrimination legislation, executive 
directors' retirement age is 65 but they retain any previous rights they 
had to retire and draw their pensions without actuarial reduction for 
early payment at an earlier age.
Following the changes made to take account of the Pensions 
Simplification tax changes which came into effect from April 2006, UK 
executives reaching the Lifetime Allowance (LTA) were given a number 
of choices as previously reported. These were:
 - remain in the pension scheme and pay any additional tax charge; or
 - opt out of the pension scheme (and so earn no further pension 
benefits in respect of future service) and instead receive a taxable 
salary supplement. This supplement will be 30% of salary and 20% 
of salary for those senior executives with a two-thirds salary target 
after at least 20 years' and 30 years' service, respectively; or
 - restrict scheme benefits to the value of the LTA with the remainder 
being provided directly from the Company as an unfunded promise. 
At retirement, the unfunded Company benefits can be either taken 
as pension or commuted in full for a taxable lump sum.
The Committee reviews these arrangements each year in the light of 
developing market practice, and believes they remain appropriate as 
they provide executives with competitive pension benefits and choices 
for dealing with the LTA which may better suit their needs whilst being 
broadly cost neutral to the Company , are in line with market practice 
and do not compensate executives for changes in taxation.
The review carried out in 2010 concluded that the arrangements 
should continue to be based on the Company' s registered pension 
schemes and that, in appropriate circumstances, the Company will 
continue to have the option to offer an unfunded pension promise so 
as to mitigate the impact of the Lifetime Allowance (introduced in 
2006) and the impact of the reduced Annual Allowance with effect 
from 6 April 2011. This arrangement addresses tax-inefficiencies 
arising for existing employees as a consequence of the pension tax 
changes although members will be given the choice to remain in the 
current arrangement and pay the increased tax. The Committee has 
decided that in cases where the Company is to pay an unfunded 
promise, executives will be given the choice to commute some or all of 
the benefit for a taxable lump sum, or take it as pension.
Ian King and Peter Lynas already have an unfunded promise from the 
Company arising from the 2006 changes, which has been extended to 
cover the reduced Annual Allowance at no additional cost to the 
Company.
Ian King and Peter Lynas are both members of the BAE Systems 2000 
Pension Plan (the 2000 Plan), applicable to former employees of 
Marconi Electronic Systems (MES), and members of the ExPS with a 
normal retirement age of 62. The 2000 Plan provides a pension of 
1/50th of Final Pensionable Earnings (FPE) for each year of 
pensionable service, payable from a normal retirement age of 65 and 
members pay contributions of 8% of Pensionable Earnings. FPE under 
Other share schemes, pensions and 
executive directors' service contracts 92 BAE Systems Annual Report 2011
REMUNERATION REPORT (continued)
the 2000 Plan is the best consecutive three-year average of base 
salary and bonus in the ten Plan Y ears prior to leaving, less an offset 
for State pensions. The Company decided in 2006 to limit 
pensionable bonuses in the 2000 Plan in the 2006/07 Plan Y ear to 
20% of base salary and to 10% of base salary for the 2007/08 Plan 
Y ear and thereafter . However , there is a guarantee that the FPE figure 
for benefits in respect of service prior to 6 April 2007 will not be less 
than the FPE figure at 5 April 2007 to ensure that employees do not 
lose the benefit of contributions paid on past bonuses. Ian King and 
Peter Lynas joined the ExPS in 1999 following the BAe/MES merger . 
Therefore their individual total pensions are the sum of their 2000 
Plan benefits plus the top up from the ExPS, some of which is provided 
through the unfunded promise referred to above.
US pension benefits
Linda Hudson is a member of the 2006 Plan and a Non-Qualified Plan 
which provide a cash sum at retirement equal to a percentage of 
career average pay (salary plus bonus subject to a maximum bonus of 
150% of salary). The cash accrual rate of the combined plans from 
1  January 2010 is 14.1% of career average pay. Executive directors 
pay contributions at the same rates as other employees in the plan, 
being 1.5% of earnings. Linda Hudson also receives a company match 
on her contributions to her 401(k) plan up to a maximum contribution 
of 6% of salary, up to regulatory limits ($245,000). From 1 January 
2010, the company match was 85%.
Details of post-retirement benefits for each of the executive directors 
who served during 2011 are shown in T able D on page 100 and are 
calculated in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 8 of the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008.
Other benefits
Other benefits provided to executive directors are detailed under 
T able  C on page 99.
Further to his appointment as Group Finance Director on 1 April 2011, 
it was agreed that Peter Lynas would be provided with Company 
support to establish a second home in London as the Committee 
believed this to be a more cost-effective option for the Company than 
requiring full relocation of his principal residence from outside 
London. This support is in accordance with Company policy, and 
consists of a lump sum of  22,200, together with a monthly 
allowance totalling  33,300 in year one declining on a uniform basis 
to  6,660 in year five (such monthly allowances over the five-year 
period totalling  99,900), and zero thereafter . Clawback provisions 
operate during the first two years of this arrangement whereby he 
would be required to repay these monies on a pro-rata basis should he 
leave the Company in certain circumstances, e.g. resignation or 
termination. No payments have yet been made under this 
arrangement.
Executive directors' service contracts
It is the Committee' s policy that executive directors should normally 
have service contracts that provide for the Company to give the 
individual 12 months' notice of termination. This policy has been 
chosen because it provides a reasonable balance between the need 
to retain the services of key individuals and the need to limit the 
liabilities of the Company in the event of the termination of a contract. 
The executive directors have service contracts with Group companies 
and details of these are shown below.

In the event of the termination of an executive director' s contract it is 
the Committee' s policy to seek to limit any payment made in lieu of 
notice to a payment equal to the amount of one year' s base salary. 
The service contracts for Ian King and Peter Lynas contain specific 
provisions to the effect that the Company has the right to pay a sum 
equivalent to 12-months' salary in lieu of notice.
Linda Hudson' s contract of employment automatically renews for 
one-year periods from 31 December each year , unless one party gives 
notice of non-renewal. Separately, there is a 90-day termination 
provision. If the employment is (a) terminated by the Company (other 
than for cause as defined in the contract or in the event it is not 
extended following her 65th birthday) or (b) she resigns for a  Good 
Reason' (as defined in her contract), she is entitled to a termination 
payment equal to (i) one year' s base salary, (ii) a pro-rated bonus for 
the relevant financial year , and (iii) the continuation of 18-months' 
medical benefits, plus a further 18-months' subsidy of a portion of the 
premiums (or a cash payment in lieu of this benefit).
George Rose retired from the Company, and as a director , on 31 March 
2011. He was employed under a service contract dated 16 November 
1998 (amended 3 December 1999, 15 January 2004 and 17 October 
2005). No termination payments were made when his contract ended. 
All outstanding long-term incentive awards and share options will vest 
in accordance with the rules of the respective share plans, i.e. subject 
to the attainment of the related performance conditions and pro-rating 
in accordance with the length of his service against the relevant 
performance period. As reported last year , on leaving the Company, he 
was granted consent from the Company to early retirement and his 
pension benefits became payable from 1 April 2011, one year early. 
His pension was subject to the normal actuarial reduction for early 
payment that would be applied to any other member of the Executive 
Pension Scheme in these circumstances.
No executive director has provisions in his or her service contract that 
relate to a change of control of the Company (and neither does the 
Chairman nor the non-executive directors in their letters of 
appointment).
Policy on external board appointments
The long-standing policy of allowing executive directors to hold 
external non-BAE Systems-related non-executive directorships with 
the prior approval of the Committee will continue. The Committee 
considers that external directorships provide the Company' s senior 
executives with valuable experience that is of benefit to BAE Systems. 
It is also considered appropriate for BAE Systems to contribute to the 
pool of non-executive expertise available for the benefit of the wider 
business community, thereby reciprocating the benefit that it in turn 
has received from other organisations which have permitted members 
of their senior management teams to serve on the BAE Systems 
Board. The Committee believes that it is reasonable for the individual 
executive director to retain any fees received from such appointments 
given the additional personal responsibility that this entails. Such 
fees retained by executive directors in 2011 for the period in which 
they served on the BAE Systems Board were as follows: Ian King 
 44,000 in respect of his non-executive directorship of Rotork plc and 
George Rose  22,750 in respect of his non-executive directorship of 
National Grid plc.  BAE Systems Annual Report 2011 93 
Governance
Chairman's appointment, term and fees
Dick Olver was appointed Chairman on 1 July 2004. His appointment 
was for an initial fixed three-year term with effect from 17 May 2004 
(the date that he was appointed to the Board as a non-executive 
director) and was subsequently extended in 2007 for a second term 
of three years to 16 May 2010. Following the approval of the Board 
under the chairmanship of Sir Peter Mason, Senior Independent 
Director , it was extended again in 2009 for a third term to 16 May 
2013, and subsequently in 2011 to 16 May 2014 unless terminated 
earlier in accordance with the Articles of Association or with either 
party giving the other not less than six months' prior written notice. 
The Chairman' s appointment is documented in a letter of appointment 
which is not a contract of employment and he is required to devote no 
fewer than two days a week to his duties as Chairman. His 
appointment as Chairman will automatically terminate if he ceases to 
be a director of the Company. Recognising that the Chairman' s fees 
had not changed since 2007, the Remuneration Committee 
undertook a review of the level of his fees in 2011 taking into account, 
amongst other things, the scope of the duties performed by the 
Chairman of the Company. As a result, his fee was set at  725,000 
per annum with effect from 1 June 2011. This fee will not be reviewed 
again during his current term of office, which ends on 16 May 2014.
Non-executive directors' appointment,

The non-executive directors do not have service contracts but do have 
letters of appointment detailing the basis of their appointment. The 
dates of their original appointment were as follows:

* Subject to re-election at the AGM following their appointment and subsequently  
 at intervals of no more than three years in accordance with the Company' s  
 Articles of Association.
The non-executive directors are normally appointed for two 
consecutive three-year terms subject to review after the end of the 
first three-year period and with any third term of three years being 
subject to rigorous review and taking into account the need 
progressively to refresh the Board. They do not have periods of notice 
and the Company has no obligation to pay compensation when their 
appointment terminates. Under the Company' s Articles of 
Association, they are subject to re-election at the AGM following their 
appointment and subsequently at intervals of no more than three 
years. 
Sir Peter Mason completed his third three-year term as a non-
executive director on 21 January 2012. After careful consideration by 
the Board as to whether he remained independent despite the length 
of time that he had served on the Board, the Board concluded that he 
did remain independent and that his appointment should continue for 
a further 12 months to 21 January 2013. Further details on the 
rationale for this decision are set out on page 105. 
Having completed a three-year term of appointment, Ravi Uppal retired 
from the Board on 1 April 2011 having originally been appointed to the 
Board on 2 April 2008. Roberto Quarta retired from the Board on 
31  December 2011 having originally been appointed to the Board on 
7 September 2005. Michael Hartnall will stand down from the Board 
at the AGM on 2 May 2012.
In compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all members 
of the Board submit themselves for re-election on an annual basis at 
the AGM.
Non-executive directors are proposed by the Nominations Committee 
and are appointed by the Board on the basis of their experience to 
provide independent judgement on issues of strategy, performance, 
resources and standards of conduct.
Following publication of the UK Corporate Governance Code in 2010, 
the time commitment expectations for non-executive directors were 
reviewed and, with their agreement, their Letters of Appointment were 
amended to reflect that they need to commit approximately two days 
for each of the Board meetings scheduled during the year , to cover 
attendance and preparation for the meeting. Additional time 
commitments will include attending scheduled Board committee 
meetings, strategy review meetings and ad hoc meetings of the Board 
(or sub-committees of the Board) that may be called from time to time. 
The non-executive directors are aware that it is not possible to be 
specific as to exact time commitments as this will vary according to 
the nature of the matters that the Board is required to deal with at any 
point in time. Newly appointed non-executive directors also have to 
dedicate additional time to induction activities. The level of their fees 
is set by the Non-Executive Directors' Fees Committee to reflect this 
time commitment and responsibility, and after reviewing practice in 
other comparable companies. Having undertaken its review in January 
2012, the Committee decided to increase the fee for the Audit 
Committee Chairman to  25,000 per annum and to increase the 
travel allowance by  500. The non-executive directors' fees for 2012 
will therefore be as follows:
2011 fee 2012 fee
Base fee  75,000  75,000
Additional fee for chairing committees:
Audit Committee  20,000  25,000
Corporate Responsibility Committee  20,000  20,000
Remuneration Committee  20,000  20,000
Additional fee for Senior Independent Director  20,000  20,000
T ravel allowance (per meeting)*  4,000  4,500
* The travel allowance of  4,500 (2011  4,000) per meeting is paid on each  
 occasion that a non-executive director' s attendance at a Board meeting  
 necessitates air travel of more than five hours (one-way) to the meeting location,  
 subject to a maximum of six travel allowances per year .
The table below summarises the fee structure for 2011 and 2012:
Non-executive director 2011 fee* 2012 fee*
Chairman Audit Committee  95,000  100,000
Chairman Corporate Responsibility 
Committee  95,000  95,000
Chairman Remuneration Committee  95,000  95,000
Senior Independent Director  95,000  95,000
Other non-executive directors  75,000  75,000
* Excludes the travel allowance per meeting referred to above.

PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN (PSP)
A full description of the PSP is set out on pages 88 and 89. PSP awards granted since 2008 attract dividends prior to vesting.
PSP
TSR
 - nil vesting if the Company' s T otal Shareholder Return (TSR) at the end of the three-year performance period is outside the top 50% of 
TSRs achieved by a sectoral comparator group; 25% vesting if TSR is at median (50%); and 100% vesting if TSR is in the top 20%, with vesting 
on a straight-line basis between these two points.
PSP
EPS
 - proportion of the award exercisable is determined by the rate of average annual EPS growth over the three-year performance period, with 
nil vesting at average annual EPS growth of 5% or less, 100% vesting at 11% growth, and vesting on a straight-line basis between these two 
points.
Awards that vest are exercisable in three tranches at the end of years three, four and five (except for US executives where the awards are 
automatically delivered at the end of years three, four and five, subject to the performance condition being achieved). 96 BAE Systems Annual Report 2011

EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION PLAN (EXSOP)
No options have been granted under this Plan since 2007. The Plan was established in 2001 and its ten-year life expired in 2011. No further 
grants will be made under this Plan. Options granted under this Plan are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of grant. 
The maximum duration of an option is ten years.
(i)   2005-2007 grants - 33.33% of each option grant is exercisable if the Company achieves on average real EPS growth pa of 3% but less 
than 4% over the three-year performance period; 66.67% for real EPS growth pa of 4% but less than 5%; and 100% for real EPS growth of 
5% or more;
(ii)  2004 grant - as in (i) but performance is retested at the end of year five against the full period from grant; and 
(iii)  2003 grant - as in (i) but performance is retested at the end of years four and five against the full period from grant.
SHARE MATCHING PLAN (SMP) - MATCHING SHARES
A full description of the SMP is set out on page 90. SMP awards attract dividends prior to vesting.
2009-2011 awards - nil match for average EPS growth of less than 5% pa increasing uniformly to a 2:1 match at 11% pa growth.
2008 award - nil match for average EPS growth of 5% pa or less, increasing uniformly to a 1:1 match for 8% pa growth.
RATIONALE FOR KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR PSP , EXSOP AND SMP
EPS - importance to major investors as a key indicator of long-term financial performance and value creation.
TSR (and secondary financial measure) - importance to major investors as an indication of both earnings and capital growth relative to major 
companies in the same sector , and to ensure that awards only vest if there has been a clear improvement in the Company' s performance over 
the relevant period.  BAE Systems Annual Report 2011 97

Linda Hudson' s PSP award which vested on 28 March 2011 also attracted reinvested dividends which equated on release to an additional 1,888 shares. The market price 
on vesting was  3.29.
Note: Performance conditions for the options and awards set out above are detailed in the notes to T able B on pages 95 and 96.
1 The award lapsed, or partially lapsed, during the financial year under review having not met the full performance condition.
2 Subject to a performance condition that has been met.
3   Date from which exercisable' refers to the date on which the portion of the award released during the year became available for release. The portion of the award of 
shares remaining at the year end will be delivered in two tranches on the fourth and fifth anniversary of grant. 
4 The outstanding award lapsed, or partially lapsed, after the end of the financial year having not met the full performance condition.
5 Subject to a performance condition that is yet to be tested.
Note: Awards granted to Linda Hudson (a US national) under the PSP are technically characterised as long-term incentives rather than options as, subject to the attainment 
of the performance condition, they are delivered automatically on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of grant without the need to exercise an option. They are shown in the 
top portion of the table for ease of comparison. Gains on delivered PSP awards for Linda Hudson are included in the directors' gains on LTIPs figure on page 98 whilst PSP 
gains for the UK-based directors are included in the share option gain figure.
RESTRICTED SHARE PLAN (RSP)
The RSP is the time-vesting long-term incentive plan element applicable to senior executives in the US. Approved by shareholders at the 2011 
AGM, it does not have performance elements attached to it other than time-vesting conditions as it seeks to mirror US remuneration practices 
where performance-related LTIP awards only typically make up around one-third of the overall long-term incentive package for a US executive.  98 BAE Systems Annual Report 2011

* Normal Retirement Age
1  Accrued benefits may be reduced if they are taken before the normal retirement age of the scheme. In addition, a longevity adjustment factor applies to UK pension 
accrued after 5 April 2006.
2  T ransfer values have been calculated in accordance with GN11 issued by the actuarial profession. For UK-based directors the assumptions are the same as those used 
in the calculation of cash equivalents from the schemes. For US-based directors the assumptions are the same as those used for accounting disclosures. The increase 
in transfer value arising from the change in assumptions is: Linda Hudson:  7,077; Ian King:  1,840,533; Peter Lynas:  776,848.
3  Linda Hudson is a member of a US retirement plan which provides a cash sum at retirement equal to a percentage of career average pay. The accrued benefit shown 
above is a cash lump sum amount payable at normal retirement age. This benefit comprises  77,623 from a contributory Qualified Plan and  645,129 from Non-
Qualified Plans. In addition, Linda Hudson participates in a Section 401(k) defined contribution arrangement set up for US employees in which the Company will match 
employee contributions up to a limit. In 2011, the Company paid contributions of  7,788 into this 401(k) arrangement during the year . Linda Hudson is paid in US 
dollars. Of the change in the accrued benefit and the transfer value  4,712 and  3,842, respectively, is due to currency movements.
4  Ian King has an unfunded unapproved retirement arrangement for benefits in excess of the Lifetime Allowance. The pension and transfer value figures shown are in 
respect of his total benefit.
5  Peter Lynas has an unfunded unapproved retirement arrangement for benefits in excess of the Lifetime Allowance. Peter Lynas was appointed as a director from 1 April 
2011 and was a member of these pension arrangements before he became a director . The figures quoted for Peter Lynas' benefits assume one year of benefit accrual 
from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011.
6  George Rose retired from the Board on 31 March 2011. For the nine-month period between 1 April 2011 and 31 December 2011, the Company paid George Rose a 
pension of  150,978 ( 50,774 from his funded approved arrangement and  100,204 from his unfunded unapproved arrangement) after having exchanged part of his 
approved pension for a tax-free lump sum of  450,000. The transfer value as at 31 December 2011 allows for this exchange of pension for tax-free cash.
Sir Peter Gershon and Sir Richard Lapthorne, both former directors, have unfunded pension arrangements. In 2011, the Company paid 
Sir  Peter Gershon a pension of  117,113 (2010  109,280) and Sir Richard Lapthorne a pension of  105,522 (2010  102,382) in respect 
of these arrangements.
