REMUNERATION REPORT
Dear Shareholders, 
Over the last year , the Committee has focused on the simplification of our long-term 
incentive arrangements. This has been largely achieved by replacing the Share 
Matching Plan (SMP) with an increase in the Performance Share Plan (PSP) grant 
which preserves the expected value at on-target performance and results in a better 
balance between Earnings per Share (EPS) and T otal Shareholder Return (TSR) as 
drivers of long-term incentives, whilst balancing our major objectives of motivation, 
retention, pay for performance and long-term shareholder alignment.
BAE Systems is one of the world' s largest and most geographically diverse defence, 
aerospace and security companies. We have a clearly defined strategy to deliver 
sustainable growth in value to shareholders, operating in a highly technologically 
complex market, and with a presence in five principal markets. The Group continues to 
face a more challenging trading environment as governments seek to reduce fiscal 
deficits and defence budgets are significantly reduced in certain of our major markets. 
Our strategy focuses on the growing importance of winning international business, 
where growth markets remain. The key elements of our strategy are to support our 
customers in safeguarding their vital interests, inspire and develop our people to drive 
our success, and drive shareholder value by improving financial performance and 
competitive positions across the business. The current environment is increasingly 
competitive and, to deliver growth in shareholder value, we are focused on generating 
strong cash flows and profits. Improving efficiency in our operations will also make us 
more competitive to win future business. Each year , the Board agrees the Executive 
Committee' s key objectives which are critical to delivering the Group' s strategy . For 
2013, these are set out on page 11, and are used as the basis to set the individual 
objectives for the executive directors and Executive Committee members which are 
agreed by the Chairman, Dick Olver , and the Remuneration Committee. These then 
flow down to the senior leadership team to ensure that all businesses within the Group 
are aligned with the overall Group strategy .
Our remuneration strategy is intended to recognise this business environment, whilst 
fostering a T otal Performance culture at all levels of the Group. Given the maturity of 
the Group, certain areas of corporate responsibility, such as diversity and inclusion, 
will not be specifically incentivised in 2013. In determining the levels of executive 
reward, the Remuneration Committee believes it is of utmost importance to ensure a 
strong link between actual remuneration received and the achievement of our 
strategic and business objectives. The remuneration strategy incentivises executives 
to deliver their contribution and rewards them for the achievement of the Group' s 
strategy through a combination of short-term incentives targeted at Group 
performance, business performance, personal performance and leadership 
behaviours, and long-term incentives targeted at Group performance (and business 
performance in the case of our US senior executives). T o directly align short-term and 
long-term reward, executive directors will be required to defer at least one-third of their 
net 2013 annual incentive into shares when the annual incentive is paid in 2014. 
The combination of the annual incentive plan, PSP and share options provides a 
balance between short-term cash reward and longer-term share-based reward. The 
proportion of the incentive package delivered through longer-term performance is 
significantly higher at stretch pay-out than at on-target, demonstrating that the 
package supports the achievement of superior long-term performance and strongly 
aligns the interests of executives to those of shareholders by delivering long-term 
reward in shares. Achieving strong performance on the in-year measures is important 
but, to maximise the value of their incentive package, executives need to realise 
growth in long-term EPS, TSR and share price.
In 2012, our performance against targets was as follows. Our EPS of 38.6p (underlying 
EPS adjusted to exclude the effect of foreign exchange) was below threshold; the 
stretch target for both year-end and average cash was achieved. Our TSR performance 
reflects the sustained under-performance of our share price. The reported diluted 
underlying EPS of 38.8p is below the level required for any vesting of PSP and SMP 
long-term incentives awarded in 2010. This result of 38.8p will form the baseline EPS 
figure against which performance of the 2013 PSP award will be measured. 
Against this performance background, the main aspects of our remuneration policy 
and practice for the year were as follows:
 - For 2013, the salaries of the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and the 
President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE  Systems, Inc. were frozen. There will 
be no increase in base compensation and no increase in earnings opportunity 
flowing through the rest of the package.

The Remuneration Committee was in place 
throughout 2012 and held seven meetings. 
Details of attendance at these meetings are 
provided on page 83. All its members are 
independent in accordance with the provisions 
of the Code. 
The Chief Executive and the Company' s 
Chairman attend meetings by invitation only. 
They do not attend where their individual 
remuneration is discussed and no director is 
involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.
Summary of responsibilities 
 - Agreeing a policy for the remuneration of the 
Chairman, executive directors, members of 
the Executive Committee (EC), the Company 
Secretary and other senior executives
 - Within the agreed policy, determining 
individual remuneration packages for the 
Chairman, executive directors and EC 
members
 - Agreeing the policy on terms and conditions to 
be included in service agreements for the 
Chairman, executive directors, EC members, 
the Company Secretary and other senior 
executives, including termination payments 
and compensation commitments, where 
applicable
 - Approving any employee share-based 
incentive schemes and any performance 
conditions to be used for such schemes
 - Determining any share scheme performance 
targets  94 BAE Systems Annual Report 2012
 - Annual bonus pay-outs for the executive directors under the annual incentive plan 
ranged from 55.1% to 68.2% of maximum.
 - EPS performance over the three-year performance period for the 2010 awards 
under the long-term incentive plans was below the minimum 5% per annum average 
growth requirement. Consequently:
 - the SMP award granted in 2010 earned a nil match; and
 - of the 50% of the awards of shares granted in March 2010 under the EPS portion 
of the PSP , none will vest. 
 - The Company' s TSR for the 50% of awards of shares granted in March 2010 under 
the TSR portion of the PSP was below the median position when compared against 
the comparator group of 17 other defence and aerospace companies, and the 
related awards accordingly lapsed.
The Committee will continue to monitor the market and will consult with shareholders 
on any further changes for 2014 to ensure that our plans continue to demonstrate a 
clear line of sight for executives to the achievement of strategic goals and strong 
alignment with the creation of shareholder value. 
The Committee received important feedback from shareholders during last year' s 
consultation largely around the perceived complexity of our long-term incentive 
arrangements. Specific questions were raised about the need for the SMP and the 
use of EPS performance in both this plan and the PSP . The Committee is proposing 
the following changes to our executive remuneration framework for 2013: 
 - Elimination of the SMP , with redistribution of the associated value into the PSP . 
Despite the increased face value award under the PSP , the expected value of the 
overall package remains unchanged and grants remain within the current PSP plan 
limits of 400%. 
 - The holding period under the PSP whereby vested shares are released in three 
tranches over years three, four and five is unchanged. The redistribution of value 
from the SMP into the PSP means that all of this element of reward value will be 
subject to phased five-year vesting compared to the current three-year vesting for 
the prior SMP . 
 - The PSP will continue to be based 50% on EPS and 50% on TSR against a 
comparator group comprising companies with a significant defence focus in order 
to ensure meaningful alignment between the Group' s strategy for delivering 
shareholder value and executive performance. Elimination of the SMP (which has a 
sole EPS performance condition) results in an increased emphasis on TSR as a 
metric within the long-term incentive structure and a better balance with EPS. 
 - In the case of the President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE  Systems, Inc., 50% 
of the PSP is based on a measure relating to operating cash performance of the US 
businesses (with the other 50% being subject to the same EPS performance 
condition as applies to other executive directors). The President and Chief 
Executive Officer of BAE  Systems, Inc. also participates in the Restricted Share 
Plan introduced following shareholder approval at the 2011 AGM, which applies to 
US-based executives and has no performance conditions attached. 
 - Despite the challenging economic environment and reduction in defence budgets, 
no adjustments are being made to the performance conditions - which remain a 
challenging target of 5% to 11% growth per annum - or vesting structure within the 
PSP . 
 - The Committee intends to implement a simple bonus deferral and claw back 
mechanism, in line with UK shareholder and regulatory guidance and without 
matching provisions. As currently, it is proposed that one third of the annual 
incentive will be compulsorily deferred into shares without performance conditions 
and will be held for a minimum of three years, with claw back provisions in the event 
that performance is subsequently found to have been misstated. 
 - We are retaining our requirement for executive directors to build up a significant 
personal shareholding and increasing the minimum shareholding requirements for 
the Chief Executive from 200% to 300% of salary. Reflecting US market practice, 
the shareholding requirement for the President and Chief Executive Officer of 
BAE  Systems, Inc. was increased substantially last year from 200% to 350% of 
salary. 
 - We will add order intake as a third financial metric within the Annual Incentive Plan 
to sit alongside EPS and cash, to ensure an appropriate alignment with the Board' s 
strategic growth objectives.

Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
The Committee appointed Kepler Associates as 
its Independent Adviser in 2007 to provide 
advice to the Committee and its individual 
members on all aspects of the Committee' s 
remit. Kepler is a founding member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group (RCG) and 
complies with the RCG' s code of conduct for 
remuneration consultants to the FTSE 350. 
Kepler will not undertake any work for the 
Company whilst they are retained as the 
Committee' s independent adviser . 
Representatives from Kepler are generally 
invited to attend Committee meetings unless 
specifically requested otherwise by the 
Committee and attended all but one of the 
Committee' s seven meetings during 2012. 
During the year , the Committee also received 
material assistance and advice on remuneration 
policy from the Group' s Human Resources 
Director (Alastair Imrie until 31 March and Lynn 
Minella from 11 June) and the Human 
Resources Director , Reward, Paul Farley. 
Dick  Olver , Chairman, and Ian King, Chief 
Executive, also provided advice that was of 
material assistance to the Committee. 
Legal advice to the Committee has been 
provided by Linklaters who are appointed by the 
Company and who also provided services to the 
Company during the year . The Committee is 
satisfied that the services provided to it by 
Linklaters are of a technical nature and did not 
create any conflict of interest. If a conflict of 
interest were to arise in the future, the 
Committee would appoint separate legal 
advisers from those used by the Company.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, who are appointed by 
the Company and also provided services to the 
Company during the year , provided detailed 
information on market trends and the 
competitive positioning of packages. Mercer 
provided data to the BAE  Systems, Inc. 
Compensation Committee, which was also used 
to support the review of competitive positioning 
of packages. 
Hewitt New Bridge Street, who are appointed by 
the Committee, provided advice on the TSR 
figures for assessing the performance condition 
under the PSP .  BAE Systems Annual Report 2012 95 
Governance
 - As part of a wider effort to strengthen the US business' competitive position across 
current and future markets, and consistent with the treatment of all other 
BAE  Systems, Inc. employees, the formula for calculating pension benefits 
applicable to the President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc. earned 
after 31 December 2012 will change from a 10% of plan compensation annual 
accrual to a flat dollar amount of $1,000 plus, in the Non-Qualified Plan, an annual 
accrual of $500. 
In line with our ongoing commitment to keep our shareholders informed of 
developments in executive remuneration arrangements, we shared with our largest 
shareholders the Remuneration Committee' s views on potential changes to executive 
remuneration for 2013 in late November 2012. This set out the conclusions of our 
review at that early stage, with proposals finalised and shared more widely with our 
major shareholders in January 2013 as part of our usual cycle of engagement. During 
consultation regarding proposed changes for 2013, shareholders have expressed 
support for the overall direction and, in particular , the structural improvement to the 
long-term incentive design through elimination of the SMP . 
The Committee intends to enact the proposed changes as soon as possible after the 
formal shareholder approval of the Remuneration report at the AGM in May 2013. 
Annual incentive invitations for 2013 would set out the compulsory deferral 
requirement that would apply to annual incentive payments made in March 2014. The 
increased face value of PSP awards would coincide with this, in March 2014.

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
POLICY REPORT
Remuneration strategy
The Company' s remuneration strategy is to provide a remuneration 
package that:
 - helps to attract, retain and motivate;
 - is aligned to shareholders' interests;
 - is competitive against the appropriate market;
 - encourages and supports a T otal Performance culture aligned to 
the achievement of the Company' s strategic objectives;
 - is fair and transparent; 
 - can be applied consistently throughout the Group; and
 - balances overall commonality of design with appropriate tailoring 
to ensure competitiveness in our different principal markets.
Remuneration policy
T o achieve the strategy, the remuneration policy for executive 
directors and Executive Committee members is to:
 - set base salary with reference to median of the relevant market 
competitive level;
 - reward stretching superior performance with up to upper quartile 
reward;
 - provide an appropriate balance between:
 - short-term and long-term reward; and
 - fixed and variable reward
with the balance becoming more long term and more highly 
geared with seniority; and
 - provide a competitive package of benefits.
How remuneration is reviewed 
In determining the levels of executive reward, the Remuneration Committee believes it is of utmost importance to ensure a strong link 
between actual remuneration received and the achievement of our strategic and business objectives.
In 2012, information on the market for comparable positions was provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers so that the Committee could form a 
view as to where to position the various elements of the package relative to comparable companies. 
Appropriate comparator groups are constructed for the individual positions, taking account of company size, scale of operations and 
breadth of role. The comparator group for the UK executive directors' review in 2012 comprised 27 FTSE 100 companies where 
BAE  Systems was positioned towards the median in terms of market capitalisation and which the Committee believes is appropriate for 
benchmarking UK executive directors' packages. For the President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE  Systems, Inc., the comparator group 
for 2012 was drawn from companies in the US aerospace, defence and general industry sector , adjusted, as appropriate, to produce market 
figures consistent with the size, scale and relative independence of the US business, and adjusting where necessary to reflect the extra 
responsibility for her plc Board role.
The base salary, total cash reward (base salary plus annual incentive), total direct reward (total cash reward plus long-term incentives) and 
total reward (total direct reward plus pension) are analysed at the lower quartile, median and upper quartile for the relevant posts in the 
comparator group companies. This gives the Committee a view on the competitiveness of the individual elements of the package as well as 
the package as a whole.
The Committee also reviews market trends around the individual elements of remuneration to ensure that the structure of the package is 
appropriately aligned with market practice. The remuneration structure overall also takes account of the performance of the individual, the 
Company as a whole, and the pay and conditions of Group employees. For 2012, the review indicated that the structure is broadly in line with 
the relevant market.
In setting remuneration levels, the Committee is also sensitive to the pay and conditions of other employees within the Group. Many of our 
employees work at the very leading edge of technology. We have a diverse workforce operating in many countries. Employee remuneration 
packages are therefore determined locally to meet local needs, whilst respecting our culture and values. In 2012, general salary increases 
for our two largest employee populations in the UK and US typically averaged 3% and 3.5%, respectively. 
The Committee intends to continue to flow down executive remuneration policy as detailed in this report to Executive Committee members 
and to the most senior executives within the Group globally to maintain a consistent approach to global reward. The principles of the 
remuneration strategy are applied consistently across the Group below this level, taking account of seniority and local market practice.
Elements of package Purpose and link to strategy
Base salary Recognise market value of role and individual' s skills, experience and performance to ensure the 
business can attract and retain talent.
Annual incentive Drive and reward annual performance of individuals, teams and the Company on both financial and 
non-financial metrics, including behaviours.
Performance Share Plan Drive and reward delivery of sustained long-term EPS and TSR performance aligned to the interests 
of shareholders.
Share Option Plan Drive and reward delivery of TSR performance and sustained improvement in the Company' s share 
price.
Restricted Share Plan Provide long-term reward and address retention issues, through time-vesting awards principally in 
the Company' s US market.
Pension provision Provide competitive retirement benefits which reward long-term performance through seniority and 
loyalty through long service.
Other benefits Provide competitive cost-effective benefits through leveraging the Company' s size and scale.  BAE Systems Annual Report 2012 97

Base salary
The Committee reviewed base salaries, taking into account the 
current economic climate, the challenges facing the business, their 
respective positions against benchmark and the pay environment 
for employees in general. No changes have been made to annual 
base salary levels for executive directors in 2013, which remain as 
follows:
Name 2012 salary 2013 salary Increase
Ian King  963,050  963,050 0%
Peter Lynas  546,000  546,000 0%
Linda Hudson $1,045,350 $1,045,350 0%
Annual incentive plan
The annual incentives for 2013 continue to focus on a combination 
of in-year financial performance, and longer-term performance and 
risk management (both business risk and reputation risk). 
Four-fifths is driven off in-year financial performance, and one-fifth 
based on driving performance and improvement in the area of 
corporate responsibility and safety, combined with the other 
non-financial objectives supporting the Group' s strategy.
The financial targets are derived from the IBP , and are based on 
earnings, cash and order intake targets. These are seen as the key 
indicators of both short-term and long-term financial performance 
and value creation. At Group level, EPS is used whereas EBITA
1
 is 
used to measure earnings performance at a business level. T o 
incentivise improved phasing of cash generation throughout the 
year , a combination of year-end and average quarterly net cash/
debt has been in place since 2009 and will continue for 2013. Due 
to the stretching nature of the plan, the payout structure includes 
threshold, target and stretch levels for both EPS and cash 
measures. Order intake has target and stretch levels only. The 
payout for on-target performance is 50% of maximum. The payout 
for achieving a threshold performance is 20% of the maximum, with 
no payout for achieving less than this. Payout for performance 
between targets is calculated on a straight-line basis.
The table below summarises the overall structure of the annual 
incentives for executive directors.
Proportion of annual incentive
Performance measure 2012 2013
In-year financial 80.0% 80.0%
Corporate responsibility and safety 10.0% 7.5%
Other objectives 10.0% 12.5%
In setting targets for the annual incentive plan, the Committee 
expects that these should represent positive progression relative 
to the level of performance achieved in the prior year .
The Committee believes that the annual incentive targets for the 
executive directors are stretching but achievable. The structure of 
the 2013 annual incentive plan for executive directors is 
summarised in their individual sections on pages 101 to 103.
Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs)
The Company currently operates four LTIPs - the Performance Share 
Plan (PSP), the Share Option Plan (ExSOP
2012
), the Share Matching 
Plan (SMP) and, for US executives only , the Restricted Share Plan 
(RSP) - the details of which are set out on pages 104 to 106. 
The proposed simplification changes to our long-term incentive 
structure for 2013 are set out in the Committee Chairman' s report 
on pages 93 to 95.

Executive directors' service contracts
It is the Committee' s policy that executive directors should normally 
have service contracts that provide for the Company to give the 
individual 12 months' notice of termination. This policy has been 
chosen because it provides a reasonable balance between the 
need to retain the services of key individuals and the need to limit 
the liabilities of the Company in the event of the termination of a 
contract. The executive directors have service contracts with Group 
companies and details of these are shown below.

8 January 2010)

1 April 2011)
No fixed term 12 months 
either party
*  Subject to automatic renewal for one-year periods each year unless either 
party gives notice of non-renewal.
In the event of the termination of an executive director' s contract it 
is the Committee' s policy to seek to limit any payment made in lieu 
of notice to a payment equal to the amount of one year' s base 
salary. The service contracts for Ian King and Peter Lynas contain 
specific provisions to the effect that the Company has the right to 
pay a sum equivalent to 12-months' salary in lieu of notice.
Linda Hudson' s contract of employment automatically renews for 
one-year periods from 31 December each year , unless one party 
gives notice of non-renewal. Separately, there is a 90-day 
termination provision. If the employment is (a) terminated by the 
Company (other than for cause as defined in the contract or in the 
event it is not extended following her 65th birthday) or (b) she 
resigns for a  Good Reason' (as defined in her contract), she is 
entitled to a termination payment equal to (i) one year' s base salary, 
(ii) a pro-rated bonus for the relevant financial year , and (iii) the 
continuation of 18-months' medical benefits, plus a further 
18-months' subsidy of a portion of the premiums (or a cash 
payment in lieu of this benefit).
No executive director has provisions in his or her service contract 
that relate to a change of control of the Company (and neither does 
the Chairman nor the non-executive directors in their letters of 
appointment).

Policy on external board appointments
The long-standing policy of allowing executive directors to hold 
external non-BAE Systems-related non-executive directorships with 
the prior approval of the Committee will continue. The Committee 
considers that external directorships provide valuable experience 
that is of benefit to BAE  Systems. It is also considered appropriate 
for BAE  Systems to contribute to the pool of non-executive expertise 
available for the benefit of the wider business community , thereby 
reciprocating the benefit that it in turn has received from other 
organisations which have permitted members of their senior 
management teams to serve on the BAE Systems Board. The 
Committee believes that it is reasonable for the individual executive 
director to retain any fees received from such appointments given 
the additional personal responsibility that this entails. Such fees 
retained by executive directors in 2012 were as follows: Ian King 
 47,000 in respect of his non-executive directorship of Rotork p.l.c.; 
and Linda Hudson $56,550 in respect of her non-executive 
directorship of Bank of America since her appointment in 2012. 
Chairman's appointment, term and fees
Dick Olver was appointed Chairman on 1 July 2004. His 
appointment was for an initial fixed three-year term with effect from 
17 May 2004 (the date that he was appointed to the Board as a 
non-executive director) and was subsequently extended in 2007 for 
a second term of three years to 16 May 2010. Following the 
approval of the Board under the chairmanship of the Senior 
Independent Director , it was extended again in 2009 for a third term 
to 16 May 2013, and subsequently in 2011 to 16 May 2014 unless 
terminated earlier in accordance with the Articles of Association or 
with either party giving the other not less than six months' prior 
written notice. 
The Chairman' s appointment is documented in a letter of 
appointment which is not a contract of employment and he is 
required to devote no fewer than two days a week to his duties as 
Chairman. His appointment as Chairman will automatically 
terminate if he ceases to be a director of the Company. Recognising 
that the Chairman' s fees had not changed since 2007, the 
Remuneration Committee undertook a review of the level of his 
fees in 2011 taking into account, amongst other things, the scope 
of the duties performed by the Chairman of the Company. As a 
result, his fee was set at  725,000 per annum with effect from 
1  June 2011. This fee will not be reviewed again during his current 
term of office, which ends on 16 May 2014.
Non-executive directors' appointment, term and fees
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts but do 
have letters of appointment detailing the basis of their appointment. 
The dates of their original appointment were as follows:
Non-executive director Date of appointment Expiry of current term*
Paul Anderson 08.10.2009 07.10.2015
Harriet Green 01.11.2010 31.10.2013
Lee McIntire 01.06.2011 31.05.2014
Sir Peter Mason 22.01.2003 08.05.2013
Paula Rosput Reynolds 01.04.2011 31.03.2014
Nick Rose 08.02.2010 07.02.2016
Carl Symon 11.06.2008 10.06.2014
*  Subject to re-election at the AGM following their appointment and 
subsequently at intervals of no more than three years in accordance with the 
Company' s Articles of Association. 
The non-executive directors are normally appointed for two 
consecutive three-year terms subject to review after the end of the 
first three-year period and with any third term of three years being 
subject to rigorous review and taking into account the need 
progressively to refresh the Board. They do not have periods of 
notice and the Company has no obligation to pay compensation 
when their appointment terminates. Under the Company' s Articles 
of Association, they are subject to re-election at the AGM following 
their appointment and subsequently at intervals of no more than 
three years. 
Michael Hartnall retired from the Board on 2 May 2012 having 
originally been appointed to the Board on 10 June 2003. Sir Peter 
Mason will retire from the Board at the AGM on 8 May 2013.
In compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all 
members of the Board submit themselves for re-election on an 
annual basis at the AGM.
Non-executive directors are proposed by the Nominations 
Committee and are appointed by the Board on the basis of their 
experience to provide independent judgement on issues of strategy, 
performance, resources and standards of conduct.
Following publication of the UK Corporate Governance Code in 
2010, the time commitment expectations for non-executive 
directors were reviewed and, with their agreement, their Letters of 
Appointment were amended to reflect that they need to commit 
approximately two days for each of the Board meetings scheduled 
during the year , to cover attendance and preparation for the 
meeting. Additional time commitments will include attending 
scheduled Board committee meetings, strategy review meetings 
and ad hoc meetings of the Board (or sub-committees of the Board) 
that may be called from time to time. The non-executive directors 
are aware that it is not possible to be specific as to exact time 
commitments as this will vary according to the nature of the 
matters that the Board is required to deal with at any point in time. 
Newly appointed non-executive directors also have to dedicate 
additional time to induction activities. The level of their fees is set 
by the Non-Executive Directors' Fees Committee to reflect this time 
commitment and responsibility, and after reviewing practice in other 
comparable companies. 
The Non-Executive Directors' Fees Committee comprises 
Dick  Olver , Philip Bramwell, Linda Hudson and Ian King. Having 
undertaken its review in January 2013, the Committee decided that 
the non-executive directors' fees should remain unchanged at the 
current time as follows: 
2012 and 2013 fee 
Base fee  75,000
Additional fee for chairing committees:
Audit Committee  25,000 
Corporate Responsibility Committee  20,000

Additional fee for Senior Independent Director  20,000 
T ravel allowance (per meeting)*  4,500 
*  The travel allowance of  4,500 per meeting is paid on each occasion that a 
non-executive director' s attendance at a Board meeting necessitates air travel 
of more than five hours (one-way) to the meeting location, subject to a 
maximum of six travel allowances per year .

IMPLEMENTATION REPORT
Financial performance 2012 was a challenging year with both 
constraints in our principal markets due to wider economic 
pressures, and the ongoing negotiations to formalise the price 
escalation on the Salam T yphoon programme. The Group failed to 
achieve its EPS target, as referred to on page 12, but stretch 
performance for both cash targets was achieved. At the operating 
group level, Programmes & Support missed its stretch profit target 
but achieved stretch performance on both cash targets. 
International achieved its threshold profit target, missed its 
year-end cash target and missed its stretch average cash 
performance. BAE Systems, Inc. achieved stretch performance for 
both cash targets and achieved its EBITA
1
 target. 
Non-financial performance Page 12 sets out the Executive 
Committee' s key objectives for 2012 and the assessment of 
performance against these, whilst pages 41 to 43 provide more 
detailed information on performance against the specific objectives 
relating to safety, diversity and inclusion, and environment.
Safety - The Group has continued to drive improvement of safety 
management, using its Safety Maturity Matrix (SMM) as the 
mechanism to measure and drive performance. All businesses 
reported progress against the SMM. The Group achieved a 30% 
reduction in the Recordable Accident Rate, exceeding the stretch 
target of 15%. 
Diversity and inclusion - The Group targeted progress against 
diversity and inclusion maturity matrices, which delivered to plan 
across all parts of the business. 
Environment - The Group has continued to drive progress against 
environmental maturity matrices, and to meet specific targets for 
energy, water and waste for 2012. Businesses met the targets 
they set for improvement and the cumulative impact at Group level 
was a 12% reduction in energy, 7% reduction in water consumption 
and 25% reduction in waste.
Key strategic objectives - Of the remaining key strategic objectives 
for individual executive directors in 2012, the Committee agreed 
assessments taking account of overall performance and 
leadership behavioural performance of the individual executive. 
This produced an average overall assessment of 71% of maximum.
Accordingly, the Committee determined the payout under the 2012 
annual incentive plan as follows:
2012 annual incentive payout Ian King Linda Hudson Peter Lynas
% of target 111.3% 136.4% 110.2%
% of base salary 125.2% 153.5% 88.2%
Amount  1,205,317 $1,604,310  481,572
In addition:
 - the growth in EPS over the three years to 2012 was below the 
performance range of 5% to 11% per annum. Consequently:
 - the SMP award granted in 2010 earned a nil match; and
 - none of the awards granted in March 2010 under the EPS 
portion of the PSP vest. 
 - the Company' s TSR for the 50% of awards of shares granted in 
March 2010 under the TSR portion of the PSP was below the 
median position when compared against the comparator group of 
17 other defence and aerospace companies, and the related 
awards lapsed accordingly.

and the comparators at the end of 2012 of a single  100 investment made at the

Personal shareholding policy 
The Committee has agreed a policy whereby all executive directors 
are required to establish and maintain a minimum personal 
shareholding equal to a fixed percentage of base salary. These 
limits are reviewed periodically. For 2013, the minimum 
shareholding requirement for the Chief Executive has been 
increased from 200% to 300% of base salary. The minimum 
requirement for the Group Finance Director remains at 200% of 
base salary, and at 350% in the case of the President and Chief 
Executive Officer of BAE  Systems, Inc. As a minimum, a holding 
equal to 100% (175% for the President and Chief Executive Officer 
of BAE Systems, Inc.) of base salary must be achieved as quickly as 
possible using shares vesting or options exercised through the 
executive share option schemes or long-term incentive schemes, by 
using 50% of the shares that vest or 50% of the options which are 
exercised on each occasion. Thereafter , executive directors are 
required to increase their personal shareholding gradually, on each 
occasion using 25% of the shares that vest or 25% of the options 
exercised each year , until a personal shareholding equal to the 
levels cited above is achieved and maintained. A similar 
arrangement applies to senior executives eligible for share-based 
long-term incentives with limits aligned to the levels of awards 
made under these plans.
Details of the directors' personal shareholdings are shown in 
T able  A on page 107.

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Post-retirement benefits 
UK pension benefits
UK executive directors are members of the BAE  Systems Executive 
Pension Scheme (ExPS) and members of the underlying employee 
pension plans. As such, they are subject to the same contribution 
rates payable by employees of the underlying plans, and the benefit 
changes introduced in 2006 for post-April 2006 service including 
the introduction of the Longevity Adjustment Factor , a reduction in 
the maximum level of pension increases and a change in the 
definition of Pensionable Pay.
The ExPS tops up the underlying employee plan to provide a target 
benefit for executive directors payable from normal retirement age 
of 1/30th of Final Pensionable Pay (FPP) for each year of ExPS 
pensionable service (subject to a maximum of two-thirds of FPP). 
FPP is defined as annual base salary averaged over the last 12 
months prior to leaving service in respect of service accrued to 
5  April 2006 and 36 months prior to leaving in respect of service 
from 6 April 2006. The ExPS also provides a lump sum death-in-
service benefit equal to four times base salary at date of death, and 
a spouse' s death-in-service pension equal to two-thirds of the 
prospective pension at normal retirement age. Children' s 
allowances are also payable, usually up to the age of 18. Spouses' 
pensions and children' s allowances are also payable upon death in 
retirement and death after leaving the Company' s employment with 
a deferred pension. Once in payment, pensions are increased 
annually by the rise in the Retail Prices Index subject to a maximum 
increase of 5% per year in respect of pre-6 April 2006 service and 
2.5% per year in respect of service from 6 April 2006.
As a result of the 2006 age discrimination legislation, executive 
directors' retirement age is 65 but they retain any previous rights 
they had to retire and draw their pensions without actuarial 
reduction for early payment at an earlier age.
Following the changes made to take account of the Pensions 
Simplification tax changes which came into effect from April 2006, 
UK executives reaching the Lifetime Allowance (LTA) were given a 
number of choices as previously reported. These were:
 - remain in the pension scheme and pay any additional tax charge; 
or
 - opt out of the pension scheme (and so earn no further pension 
benefits in respect of future service) and instead receive a 
taxable salary supplement. This supplement will be 30% of 
salary and 20% of salary for those senior executives with a 
two-thirds salary target after at least 20 years' and 30 years' 
service, respectively; or
 - restrict scheme benefits to the value of the LTA with the 
remainder being provided directly from the Company as an 
unfunded promise. At retirement, the unfunded Company 
benefits can be either taken as pension or commuted in full for a 
taxable lump sum.
The Committee reviews these arrangements each year in the light 
of developing market practice, and believes they remain appropriate 
as they provide executives with competitive pension benefits and 
choices for dealing with the LTA which may better suit their needs 
whilst being broadly cost neutral to the Company, are in line with 
market practice and do not compensate executives for changes in 
taxation.
The review carried out in 2010 concluded that the arrangements 
should continue to be based on the Company' s registered pension 
schemes and that, in appropriate circumstances, the Company will 
continue to have the option to offer an unfunded pension promise 
so as to mitigate the impact of further reductions to the Lifetime 
Allowance (introduced in 2006) and the impact of the reduced 
Annual Allowance. This arrangement addresses tax-inefficiencies 
arising for existing employees as a consequence of the pension tax 
changes although members will be given the choice to remain in the 
current arrangement and pay the increased tax. The Committee has 
decided that in cases where the Company is to pay an unfunded 
promise, executives will be given the choice to commute some or all 
of the benefit for a taxable lump sum, or take it as pension.
Ian King and Peter Lynas already have an unfunded promise from 
the Company arising from the 2006 changes, which has been 
extended to cover the reduced Annual Allowance at no additional 
cost to the Company.
Ian King and Peter Lynas are both members of the BAE  Systems 
2000 Pension Plan (the 2000 Plan), applicable to former 
employees of Marconi Electronic Systems (MES), and members of 
the ExPS with a normal retirement age of 62. The 2000 Plan 
provides a pension of 1/50th of Final Pensionable Earnings (FPE) 
for each year of pensionable service, payable from a normal 
retirement age of 65 and members pay contributions of 8% of 
Pensionable Earnings. FPE under the 2000 Plan is the best 
consecutive three-year average of base salary and bonus in the ten 
Plan Y ears prior to leaving, less an offset for State pensions. The 
Company decided in 2006 to limit pensionable bonuses in the 
2000 Plan in the 2006/07 Plan Y ear to 20% of base salary and to 
10% of base salary for the 2007/08 Plan Y ear and thereafter . 
However , there is a guarantee that the FPE figure for benefits in 
respect of service prior to 6 April 2007 will not be less than the FPE 
figure at 5 April 2007 to ensure that employees do not lose the 
benefit of contributions paid on past bonuses. Ian King and Peter 
Lynas joined the ExPS in 1999 following the BAe/MES merger . 
Therefore their individual total pensions are the sum of their 2000 
Plan benefits plus the top up from the ExPS, some of which is 
provided through the unfunded promise referred to above.
US pension benefits 
Linda Hudson is a member of the 2006 Plan and a Non-Qualified 
Plan which provided a cash sum at retirement equal to a percentage 
of career average pay (salary plus bonus subject to a maximum 
bonus of 150% of salary). The cash accrual rate of the combined 
plans from 1 January 2010 was 14.1% of career average pay. From 
1 January 2013, future accrual in the US pension arrangements 
changed for all employees and Linda Hudson will now receive a 
$1,000 annual accrual from the 2006 Plan and, from the Non-
Qualified Plan, a $500 annual accrual and an annual accrual of 
4.1% of salary plus bonus (subject to a maximum bonus of 150% of 
salary). Linda Hudson also receives a company match on her 
contributions to her 401(k) plan up to a maximum contribution of 
6% of salary, up to regulatory limits (for 2013, $255,000). From 
1  January 2013, the company match is 100%.
Details of post-retirement benefits for each of the executive 
directors who served during 2012 are shown in T able D on 
page  113 and are calculated in accordance with the requirements 
of Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008.
Other benefits 
Other benefits provided to executive directors are detailed under 
T able C on page 112. 
Further to his appointment as Group Finance Director , it was agreed 
that Peter Lynas would be provided with Company support to 
establish a second home in London as the Committee believed this 
to be a more cost-effective option for the Company than requiring 
full relocation of his principal residence from outside London. This 
support is in accordance with Company policy, and consists of a 
lump sum of  22,200, together with a monthly allowance totalling 
 33,300 in year one declining on a uniform basis to  6,660 in year 
five (such monthly allowances over the five-year period totalling 
 99,900), and zero thereafter . Clawback provisions operate during 
years one and two of this arrangement whereby he would be 
required to repay these monies on a pro-rata basis should he leave 
the Company in certain circumstances, e.g. resignation or 
termination. No payments have yet been made under this 
arrangement.   BAE Systems Annual Report 2012 101

Summary of Long-Term Incentive Plans
Plan provisions
Performance conditions for grants of awards to be made under the Performance Share Plan, the Share Option Plan and investment of the 2012 
annual incentive deferral into the Share Matching Plan in 2013 are detailed below. Performance conditions for grants of awards made prior to 
2013 are detailed on page 111.
Clawback arrangements have operated in respect of the Performance Share Plan and Share Matching Plan from the 2010 awards onwards, 
and have operated for grants under the Share Option Plan since its inception. The arrangements are intended to cover situations, for example, 
where results are restated or otherwise turn out to be materially inaccurate or where the executive' s employment can be terminated for cause.
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Key features for PSP awards in 2013:
 - awards of shares are granted based on a percentage of salary and share price at the date of grant;
 - the shares are subject to satisfaction of three-year performance conditions;
 - half the PSP award will be based on a T otal Shareholder Return (TSR) performance condition (PSP
TSR
) and the other half on an Earnings per 
Share (PSP
EPS
) performance condition. For US participants, the first half of the award will be based on long-term operating cash 
performance measured at the level of the US businesses, reflecting an increased emphasis from shareholders on cash flow generation;
 - in addition, there is a further test on the PSP
TSR
 element to ensure that the TSR performance is supported by the underlying performance 
of the Company;
 - shares under award after satisfaction of the performance condition vest at the end of year three. Awards that vest are exercisable in three 
tranches between the third and seventh anniversary of vesting. For US participants, the awards are automatically delivered at the end of 
years three, four and five, subject to the performance condition being achieved; and
 - shares under award attract dividends prior to vesting.

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Performance condition - PSP
EPS
The proportion of the award capable of exercise is determined by 
the rate of average annual EPS growth over the three-year 
performance period, with nil vesting at average annual EPS growth 
of 5% and 100% vesting at 11% growth as set out opposite (15% to 
33% growth over three years).
The rationale for the EPS performance measure is that major 
investors consider EPS to be a key indicator of long-term financial 
performance and value creation.
Summary of EPS performance to 31 December 2012
2012 EPS was 38.8p compared with the 2009 EPS baseline figure 
of 40.6p. This is below the performance range of 5% to 11% growth 
per annum. Accordingly, none of the EPS portion of the March 2010 
PSP awards vest.

to full vesting, and the diamond shows BAE Systems' TSR. The 
proportion that would vest is shown in the boxes at the top of the 
chart.
This shows that the TSR portion of the March 2010 PSP award 
lapsed as the Company' s TSR was below that of the comparator 
group.

TSR performance under the Performance Share Plan 
(to 31 December 2012)
Performance condition - PSP
TSR
The proportion of the award capable of exercise is determined by:
(i) the Company' s TSR (share price growth plus dividends) ranking  
relative to a comparator group of 12 other international defence  
companies as shown in the table opposite*. Reflecting the  
Group' s strategy to transition from a more diversified portfolio,  
the comparator group comprises those companies with a  
significant focus on defence and security . None of the shares  
vest if the Company' s TSR is outside the top 50% of TSRs  
achieved by the sectoral comparator group, with 25% vesting at  
median, and 100% vesting if it is in the top quintile (i.e. top 20%)  
as set out opposite; and
(ii) whether there has been a sustained improvement in the 
Company' s underlying financial performance and whether it is 
appropriate to release some or all of the awards. In taking such  
a view, the Committee may consider (but not exclusively) the 
following financial metrics: net cash/debt; EBITA
1
; order book; 
turnover; risk; and underlying project performance.
The rationale for TSR performance measures is that major investors 
regard TSR as an important indication of both earnings and capital 
growth relative to other major companies in the same sector and to 
ensure that awards only vest if there has been a clear improvement 
in the Company' s performance over the relevant period.
*  The previous comparator group for 2011 and prior years is also shown 
opposite.

costs and taxation expense. 106 BAE Systems Annual Report 2012
Share Option Plan (ExSOP
2012
)
Key features for option grants in 2013:
 - options granted under the Share Option Plan are normally 
exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of their 
grant; and
 - for share option awards made to the executive directors only, 
exercise is subject to a TSR performance condition such that:
 - 25% of each option grant is exercisable if the Company' s TSR 
(share price growth and dividends) is at the median relative to 
the comparator group (using the same 12 companies included 
in the sectoral peer group for the 2013 PSP
TSR
 performance 
condition listed on page 105).
 - 100% of each option grant is exercisable if the Company' s TSR 
(share price growth and dividends) is in the upper quintile 
relative to the comparator group. For performance between 
median and upper quintile, the proportion of options 
exercisable will be calculated on a straight-line basis.
Rationale for performance measure: major investors regard TSR as 
an important indication of both earnings and capital growth relative 
to other major companies in the same sector .
Share Matching Plan (SMP)
It has been proposed to eliminate the Share Matching Plan and as 
such this plan will operate for the last time in 2013 in respect of the 
deferral of 2012 annual incentive. Key features for grants of awards 
in 2013:
 - stand-alone share investment plan with the investment linked to 
the award under the annual incentive plan;
 - participants are granted a conditional award of matching shares 
against the gross value of the annual incentive invested;
 - matching shares attract dividends during the three-year deferral 
period, released on vesting of any matching shares;
 - executive directors are required to invest one-third of their 2012 
net annual incentive into the SMP; and
 - maximum level of investment will be 50% of the net annual 
incentive.
Match and performance condition
 - Nil match for average EPS growth of 5% per annum increasing 
uniformly to a 1:1 match at 8% per annum and a maximum 2:1 
match at 11% per annum growth (i.e. 15% to 33% growth over 
three years).
 - Rationale for performance measure: major investors consider 
EPS to be a key indicator of long-term financial performance and 
value creation.
2010 SMP award
The 2010 SMP awards were based on nil match for average EPS 
growth of 5% per annum increasing uniformly to a maximum 2:1 
match at 11% per annum growth. 2012 EPS was 38.8p and is 
below the 2009 EPS of 40.6p. Accordingly, none of the EPS portion 
of the March 2010 PSP awards vest.
Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
Key features of awards in 2013:
 - conditional awards of shares are granted based on a percentage 
of salary and share price at the date of grant;
 - the shares are subject only to the condition that the participant 
remains employed by the Group at the end of the vesting date 
(three years after the award date); and
 - shares under award attract dividends prior to vesting.
The RSP is not subject to a performance condition as it is designed 
to address retention issues principally in the US. 
Clawback arrangements operate in respect of this Plan.
Other share schemes and share usage
Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
During 2012, the UK executive directors were eligible to participate 
in the all-employee free shares element of the SIP . As a result of the 
Company' s performance in 2012, all eligible employees (including 
the UK executive directors) will be entitled to receive shares worth 
approximately  365. A similar arrangement operates for non-UK 
employees on a cash or shares basis depending on local tax and 
security laws.
The Company operates a share purchase arrangement (Partnership 
Shares) under the SIP . Under this arrangement, UK-based 
employees (including executive directors) may purchase ordinary 
shares in BAE  Systems by either monthly investments of between 
 10 and  125, or lump sum investments of between  10 and 
 1,500 in a tax year , both limited to 10% of salary if less. The 
Partnership Shares attract matching shares. As the plan is an 
all-employee plan, the matching shares are not subject to 
performance conditions in accordance with legislation. One free 
matching share is awarded for each Partnership Share up to a 
maximum of  63 per month.
Dividends paid in respect of the shares in the SIP for UK-based 
employees are reinvested as Dividend Shares.
Share usage for employee share schemes 
The Committee has agreed that, in respect of new issue or treasury 
shares, shares representing no more than 1% (and no more than 
0.5% for the executive schemes) of the Company' s issued share 
capital will be used in any one financial year for the grant of 
incentives under all of the Company' s employee share schemes. 
The table below sets out the available dilution capacity for the 
Company' s employee share schemes on this basis.
The Company currently intends to use new issue or treasury shares 
to satisfy future share awards under the executive long-term incentive 
plans and share option plans up to the 0.5% annual dilution limit, and 
to use treasury shares to satisfy awards of free shares and matching 
shares under the all-employee Share Incentive Plan.
Number  
of shares
T otal issued share capital as at 31 December 2012 3,588m
All schemes:
10% in any consecutive ten years 358.8m
Remaining headroom 200.7m
Executive schemes:
5% in any consecutive ten years 179.4m
Remaining headroom 77.0m
Where it is appropriate to use shares purchased in the market to 
satisfy employee share scheme commitments, a discretionary 
ESOP T rust is used to acquire Company shares using funds loaned 
by the Group. Further detail on the ESOP T rust is provided in note 25 
to the Group accounts.

Linda Hudson' s SMP award that vested on 26 March 2012 attracted reinvested dividends which equated on vesting to an additional 6,590 shares. The market price on 
vesting was  3.05.
Her PSP awards which vested on 26 March 2012 also attracted reinvested dividends which equated on release to an additional 4,192 shares. The market price on 
vesting was  3.05.
Note: Performance conditions for the options and awards set out above are detailed in the notes to T able B on page 111.
1 Subject to a performance condition that has been met.
2   Date from which exercisable' refers to the date on which the portion of the award released during the year became available for release. The portion of the award of 
shares outstanding at the year end will be delivered on the fifth anniversary of grant.
3 The award lapsed, or partially lapsed, during the financial year under review having not met the full performance condition.
4   Date from which exercisable' refers to the date on which the portion of the award released during the year became available for release. The portion of the award of 
shares remaining at the year end will be delivered in two tranches on the fourth and fifth anniversary of grant. 
5 The outstanding award lapsed, or partially lapsed, after the end of the financial year having not met the full performance condition.
6 Subject to a performance condition that is yet to be tested.
Note: Awards granted to Linda Hudson (a US national) under the PSP are technically characterised as long-term incentives rather than options as, subject to the 
attainment of the performance condition, they are delivered automatically on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of grant without the need to exercise an option. They 
are shown in the top portion of the table for ease of comparison. Gains on delivered PSP awards for Linda Hudson are included in the directors' gains on LTIPs figure on 
page 111 whilst PSP gains for the UK-based directors are included in the share option gain figure.  BAE Systems Annual Report 2012 111 
Governance
Notes to Table B
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
A full description of the PSP is set out on pages 104 and 105. PSP awards granted since 2008 attract dividends prior to vesting.
PSP
TSR
 - nil vesting if the Company' s T otal Shareholder Return (TSR) at the end of the three-year performance period is outside the top 50% of 
TSRs achieved by a sectoral comparator group; 25% vesting if TSR is at median (50%); and 100% vesting if TSR is in the top 20%, with vesting 
on a straight-line basis between these two points. A secondary financial measure is also used (see page 105). For US participants, this part of 
the award is based on long-term operating cash flow performance measured at the level of the US businesses (PSP
OCF
), reflecting an increased 
emphasis from shareholders on cash generation.
PSP
EPS
 - proportion of the award exercisable is determined by the rate of average annual EPS growth over the three-year performance 
period, with nil vesting at average annual EPS growth of 5% or less, 100% vesting at 11% growth, and vesting on a straight-line basis 
between these two points.
Awards that vest are exercisable in three tranches at the end of years three, four and five (except for US executives where the awards are 
automatically delivered at the end of years three, four and five, subject to the performance condition being achieved).
Executive Share Option Plan (ExSOP)
The Plan was established in 2001 and its ten-year life expired in 2011. No options have been granted under it since 2007. Options granted 
under this Plan are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of grant. The maximum duration of an option is ten years.
(i) 2005-2007 grants - 33.33% of each option grant is exercisable if the Company achieves on average real EPS growth pa of 3% but less 
than 4% over the three-year performance period; 66.67% for real EPS growth pa of 4% but less than 5%; and 100% for real EPS growth of 
5% or more;
(ii) 2004 grant - as in (i) but performance is retested at the end of year five against the full period from grant; and 
(iii) 2003 grant - as in (i) but performance is retested at the end of years four and five against the full period from grant.
Share Option Plan (ExSOP
2012
)
A full description of the ExSOP
2012
 is set out on page 106. Options granted under this Plan are normally exercisable between the third and 
tenth anniversary of grant. The maximum duration of an option is ten years.
2012 grants - for share option awards made to executive directors only, exercise is subject to a TSR performance condition such that:
 - 25% of each option grant is exercisable if the Company' s TSR is at the median relative to the comparator group; and 
 - 100% of each option grant is exercisable if the Company' s TSR is in the upper quintile relative to the comparator group. For performance 
between median and upper quintile, the proportion of options exercisable will be calculated on a straight-line basis. 
Share Matching Plan (SMP) - matching shares
A full description of the SMP is set out on page 106. SMP awards attract dividends prior to vesting.
2009-2012 awards - nil match for average EPS growth of less than 5% pa increasing uniformly to a 2:1 match at 11% pa growth.
Rationale for key performance measures for PSP , ExSOP , ExSOP
2012
 and SMP
EPS - importance to major investors as a key indicator of long-term financial performance and value creation.
TSR (and secondary financial measure) - importance to major investors as an indication of both earnings and capital growth relative to 
major companies in the same sector , and to ensure that awards only vest if there has been a clear improvement in the Company' s 
performance over the relevant period.
Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
The RSP is the time-vesting long-term incentive plan element applicable to senior executives in the US. Approved by shareholders at the 2011 
AGM, it does not have performance elements attached to it other than time-vesting conditions as it seeks to mirror US remuneration practices 
where performance-related LTIP awards only typically make up around one-third of the overall long-term incentive package for a US executive.
Share price information 
The mid-market price for the Company' s ordinary shares at 31 December 2012 was 336.9p (2011 285.1p). The range during the year was 
270.9p to 363.6p.
Aggregate amount of gains made by directors
The aggregate amount of gains made by directors from the exercise of share options in 2012, as calculated at the date of exercise, was 
 370,811 (2011  402,249). The net aggregate value of assets received by directors in 2012 from Long-T erm Incentive Plans, as 
calculated at the date of vesting, was  869,116 (2011  654,645).  112 BAE Systems Annual Report 2012

* Normal Retirement Age
1  Accrued benefits may be reduced if they are taken before the normal retirement age of the scheme. In addition, a longevity adjustment factor applies to UK pension 
accrued after 5 April 2006.
2  T ransfer values have been calculated in accordance with GN11 issued by the actuarial profession. For UK-based directors the assumptions are the same as those 
used in the calculation of cash equivalents from the schemes. For US-based directors the assumptions are the same as those used for accounting disclosures. The 
change in transfer value arising from the change in assumptions is: Linda Hudson  13,880; Ian King  (193,884); and Peter Lynas  (171,173).
3  Linda Hudson is a member of a US retirement plan which provides a cash sum at retirement equal to a percentage of career average pay. The accrued benefit shown 
above is a cash lump sum amount payable at normal retirement age. This benefit comprises  89,675 from a contributory Qualified Plan and  802,730 from 
Non-Qualified Plans. In addition, Linda Hudson participates in a Section 401(k) defined contribution arrangement set up for US employees in which the Company will 
match employee contributions up to a limit. In 2012, the Company paid contributions of  8,045 into this 401(k) arrangement during the year . Linda Hudson is paid in 
US dollars. Of the change in the accrued benefit and the transfer value  (40,133) and  (35,358), respectively, is due to currency movements.
4  Ian King has an unfunded unapproved retirement arrangement for benefits in excess of the Lifetime Allowance. The pension and transfer value figures shown are in 
respect of his total benefit.
5  Peter Lynas has an unfunded unapproved retirement arrangement for benefits in excess of the Lifetime Allowance. The pension and transfer value figures shown are 
in respect of his total benefit.
Sir Peter Gershon, Sir Richard Lapthorne and George Rose, all former directors, have unfunded pension arrangements. In 2012, the 
Company paid Sir Peter Gershon a pension of  122,120 (2011  117,113), Sir Richard Lapthorne a pension of  110,661 (2011 
 105,522) and George Rose a pension of  137,274 (2011  100,204) in respect of these arrangements.
