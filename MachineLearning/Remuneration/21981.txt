1  Linda Hudson's base salary throughout 2012 and 2013 was $1,045,350 per annum and the variance in base salary relates to foreign 
exchange movement.
2  The benefits received by Ian King include the provision of a car allowance and the private use of a chauffeur-driven car (2013  41k; 
2012  34k). The benefits received by Peter Lynas include the provision of a car allowance and the private use of a chauffeur-driven car 
(2013  17k; 2012  16k). In addition, during 2013, he received a second residence allowance of  47k which, as reported in the prior year, 
is a more cost-effective option for the Company than requiring the relocation of his principal residence from outside London. This comprises 
a lump sum of  22,200, together with a monthly allowance totalling  33,300 in year one (commencing 1 April 2013), declining on a uniform 
basis to  6,660 in year five (such monthly allowances over the five-year period totalling  99,900), and zero thereafter. Clawback provisions 
operate during years one and two of this arrangement whereby he would be required to repay these monies on a pro-rata basis should he 
leave the Company in certain circumstances, e.g. resignation or termination. Linda Hudson's benefits include the provision of a cash allowance 
for a car and parking and the private use of a chauffeur-driven car (2013  48k; 2012  42k); medical and dental benefits (2013  4k; 2012  3k); 
and insured life and disability benefits (2013  8k; 2012  9k). In addition, her benefit figures also include  83k for the private use of a 
company aircraft (2012  66k).
3  Further detail on bonus payments is provided on page 94. 
4  This column relates to estimated or actual value of Long-Term Incentive Plans for which the performance period ended in the relevant 
financial year. The 2011 PSP
EPS
 and the 2011 SMP awards (for which the performance periods ended on 31 December 2013) did not meet 
their performance conditions and lapsed (see page 95 for more detail). As reported in the prior year, the 2010 PSP and SMP awards (for 
which the performance periods ended on 31 December 2012) also lapsed.
5  The figures in this column have been calculated in line with the method set out in section 229 of the Finance Act 2004 using a capitalisation 
factor of 20 to assess the increase in the value of the pension promise over the year, net of inflation. Therefore, these figures are sensitive 
to salary increases and Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation as follows: 
 - Salary increase: As pensionable salary is averaged over three years, the figures for Peter Lynas still show the effect of the promotional 
increase following his appointment as Group Finance Director.
 - CPI inflation: In a year with high CPI inflation, the increase in the value of the pension promise would be lower than in a year with lower 
CPI inflation.
Linda Hudson's 2013 pension figure is impacted by the change in accrual rate as detailed on page 97.
6  This column includes (i) for Ian King, the value of Free Share awards under the UK all-employee Share Incentive Plan (SIP) and Matching 
Shares under voluntary investment in the SIP; (ii) for Peter Lynas, Free Share awards under the SIP and tax-exempt health-screening; and 
(iii) for Linda Hudson, the value of the 2013 grant under the Restricted Share Plan (RSP) (and corresponding prior year figure). This award 
formed part of Linda Hudson's 2013 LTIP allocation but is required to be reported under  Other' as it has no performance conditions 
attached (see page 99 for calculation of the RSP figure).
7  Retired from the Board on 1 February 2014.

1  The Group exceeded the 15% stretch target for reduction in Recordable Accident Rate (see page 28). However, the overall Group rating was reduced as a result of 
performance in the US business. All businesses demonstrated commitment to and met the stretch improvement targets set in respect of environmental performance.

The following awards had performance periods that ended on 31 December 2013:
2011 Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
 - Performance conditions: half on relative TSR against comparator group, half on EPS growth of 5% to 11% per annum. As the EPS growth rate 
was not achieved, the related half of the award lapsed. The TSR performance condition ends on 31 March 2014 and has therefore not yet 
been tested. TSR performance to 31 December 2013 is shown in the chart below. 
2011 Share Matching Plan (SMP)
 - 2:1 match on shares deferred from 2010 annual incentive based on a performance condition of EPS growth of 5% to 11% per annum. As this 
growth was not achieved, the 2011 SMP earned a nil match and the award will accordingly lapse.

1  Accrued benefits are reduced if they are taken before the normal retirement age of the scheme. In addition, a longevity adjustment factor applies to UK pension 
accrued after 5 April 2006.
2  The defined benefit figure includes both funded and unfunded arrangements for Ian King and Peter Lynas; and includes both Qualified and Non-Qualified plans 
for Linda Hudson.
3  Linda Hudson is a member of a US retirement plan which provides a cash sum at retirement equal to a percentage of career average pay. The accrued benefit 
shown above is a cash lump sum payable at normal retirement age. In addition, Linda Hudson participates in a Section 401(k) defined contribution arrangement 
set up for US employees in which the company will match employee contributions up to a limit. In 2013, the company paid contributions of  9,780 into this 
401(k) arrangement.
The above table has been subject to audit.
Current UK executive directors are members of the BAE Systems Executive Pension Scheme (ExPS) and the BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan 
(2000 Plan) which together provide a pension for executive directors payable at 62 of 1/30th of three-year final average salary for each year of 
service subject to the payment of members' contributions (currently 8%). Benefits paid prior to age 62 will be subject to actuarial reduction.
The ExPS tops up the underlying employee plan to provide a target benefit for executive directors payable from normal retirement age of 1/30th 
of Final Pensionable Pay (FPP) for each year of ExPS pensionable service (subject to a maximum of two-thirds of FPP). FPP is defined as annual 
base salary averaged over the last 12 months prior to leaving service in respect of service accrued to 5 April 2006 and 36 months prior to 
leaving in respect of service from 6 April 2006. The ExPS also provides a lump sum death-in-service benefit equal to four times base salary 
at date of death, and a spouse's death-in-service pension equal to two-thirds of the prospective pension at normal retirement age. Children's 
allowances are also payable, usually up to the age of 18. Spouses' pensions and children's allowances are also payable upon death in 
retirement and death after leaving the Company's employment with a deferred pension. Once in payment, pensions are increased annually 
by the rise in the Retail Prices Index subject to a maximum increase of 5% per year in respect of pre-6 April 2006 service and 2.5% per year 
in respect of service from 6 April 2006.
96 BAE SySt EMS ANNUAL REPORT 2013
GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REMUNERAt ION REPORt The review of pension policies carried out in 2010 by the Committee concluded that the pension benefits should continue to be based on 
the Company's registered pension schemes and that, in appropriate circumstances, the Company will continue to have the option to offer an 
unfunded pension promise so as to mitigate the impact of further reductions to the Lifetime Allowance (introduced in 2006) and the impact of 
the reduced Annual Allowance. The current executive directors were given the choice to remain in the current arrangement and pay the increased 
tax or to take an unfunded promise: they both elected for the latter. The Committee has decided that in cases where the Company is to pay 
an unfunded promise, executives will be given the choice to commute some or all of the benefit for a taxable lump sum, or take it as pension. 
Where an unfunded pension is taken, ten years after retirement, the executive will be given a further opportunity to commute the residual 
value of the unfunded pension for a lump sum.
As stated above, Ian King and Peter Lynas already have an unfunded promise from the Company arising from the 2006 changes to the taxation 
of pension benefits, which has been extended to cover the reduced Annual Allowance at no additional cost to the Company.
Ian King and Peter Lynas are both members of the 2000 Plan, applicable to former employees of Marconi Electronic Systems (MES), and 
members of the ExPS with a normal retirement age of 62. The 2000 Plan provides a pension of 1/50th of Final Pensionable Earnings (FPE) for 
each year of pensionable service, payable from a normal retirement age of 65 and members pay contributions of 8% of Pensionable Earnings. 
FPE under the 2000 Plan is the best consecutive three-year average of base salary and bonus in the ten Plan Years prior to leaving, less an 
offset for State pensions. The Company decided in 2006 to limit pensionable bonuses in the 2000 Plan in the 2006/07 Plan Year to 20% of 
base salary and to 10% of base salary for the 2007 /08 Plan Year and thereafter. However, there is a guarantee that the FPE figure for benefits 
in respect of service prior to 6 April 2007 will not be less than the FPE figure at 5 April 2007 to ensure that employees do not lose the benefit 
of contributions paid on past bonuses. Ian King and Peter Lynas joined the ExPS in 1999. Therefore, their individual total pensions are the sum 
of their 2000 Plan benefits plus the top up from the ExPS, most of which is provided through the unfunded promise referred to above.
Linda Hudson is a member of the 2006 Plan and a Non-Qualified Plan which provide a cash sum at retirement equal to a percentage of career 
average pay (salary plus bonus subject to a maximum bonus of 150% of salary). The cash accrual rate of the combined plans from 1 January 
2010 was 14.1% of career average pay. From 1 January 2013, future accrual in the US pension arrangements changed for all employees and 
Linda Hudson will now receive a $1,000 annual accrual from the 2006 Plan and, from the Non-Qualified Plan, a $500 annual accrual plus 4.1% 
of salary plus bonus (subject to a maximum bonus of 150% of salary). For benefits commencing prior to age 65, the accrued benefit is reduced 
for interest only from age 65 to the benefit commencement date using the 30-Year Treasury Rate from the October prior to commencement. 
Linda Hudson also receives a company match on her contributions to her 401(k) plan up to a maximum contribution of 6% of salary, up to 
regulatory limits (for 2014 $260,000). From 1 January 2013, the company match is 100%.
Jerry DeMuro is a member of the 2006 Plan and a Non-Qualified Plan which provide a cash sum at retirement equal to the sum of the annual 
accruals of $1,000 from the 2006 Plan and a $500 annual accrual from the Non-Qualified Plan. For benefits commencing prior to age 65, the 
accrued benefit is reduced for interest only from age 65 to the benefit commencement date using the 30-Year Treasury Rate from the October 
prior to commencement. Jerry DeMuro also receives a company match on his contributions to his 401(k) plan up to a maximum contribution 
of 6% of salary, up to regulatory limits (for 2014 $260,000). From 1 January 2013, the company match is 100%. As at the date of this Annual 
Report, he has not made an election to contribute to the 401(k) plan and is therefore not eligible for any company match.

1 The value of the award is calculated on the date of grant by reference to the middle market quotation at the close of the preceding day.
2 A sliding scale operates - further detail is provided in the summary of performance conditions overleaf.
3  Awards granted under the SMP in March 2013 relate to matching shares in respect of the bonus deferral for the year ended 31 March 2012. These awards were 
calculated on a 2:1 match on the gross value of one-third of the individual director's Annual Incentive for the 2012 financial year - further detail is provided in the 
summary of performance conditions overleaf. No further awards will be made under the SMP.
Note: PSP - Shares under award attract dividends prior to vesting. The nil cost options under the PSP are intended to be free share awards and are structured as an 
option to give the participant more flexibility as to the timing of the benefit. For the US executive director, grants under the PSP are classified as contingent awards 
(rather than share options) and are deliverable on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of grant, subject to attainment of the performance condition.
Governance GOVERNANCE
BAE SySt EmS ANNUAL REPORT 2013 99 Description of share plans and summary of performance conditions 
PSP 
Shares under award vest after satisfaction of the three-year performance condition. Shares under award attract dividends prior to vesting. 
Awards that vest are exercisable in three tranches between the third and seventh anniversary of vesting (being capable of exercise on a phased 
basis from the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of grant). For US participants, the awards are automatically delivered at the end of years three, 
four and five, subject to the performance condition being achieved.
Awards made to the UK executive directors since 2008 have been weighted 50% on the PSP
EPS
 performance condition and 50% on the PSP
TSR
 
performance condition. Awards made to the US executive director were weighted in the same way until 2011. In 2012 and 2013, the weighting 
for the US executive director was 50% on the PSP
EPS
 performance condition and 50% on the PSP
OCF
 performance condition. The TSR comparator 
groups are shown below.

PSP
EPS
Rate of average annual EPS growth over the three-year performance period, with nil vesting at 5% average growth per annum 
and 100% vesting at 11% average growth per annum, with vesting on a straight-line basis between these two parameters.
PSP
TSR
The proportion of the award capable of exercise is determined by:
(i)  the Company's TSR (share price growth plus dividends) ranking relative to a comparator group of 12 other international 
defence companies over a three-year performance period. No shares vest if the Company's TSR is outside the top 50% of 
TSRs achieved by the sectoral comparator group, with 25% vesting at median, 100% vesting if it is in the top quintile and 
vesting on a straight-line basis between these two parameters; and
(ii)  whether there has been a sustained improvement in the Company's underlying financial performance. In taking such a view, 
the Committee may consider (but not exclusively) the following financial metrics: net cash/debt; EBITA
1
; order book; turnover; 
risk; and underlying project performance. 
PSP
OCF
Long-term operating cash performance at the level of the US businesses over a three-year performance period. The Committee 
is of the view that cash performance figures are commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the 
Company to disclose them in advance.

SMP 
The SMP was a standalone investment plan linked to the award under the Annual Incentive Plan. It operated for the final time in 2013 in relation 
to the annual incentive relating to 2012 performance. Executive directors were required to invest at least one-third (and maximum 50%) of their 
annual incentive into the SMP and were granted a conditional award of matching shares against the gross value of the annual incentive 
invested. The matching shares attract dividends during the three-year deferral period, released on vesting of any matching shares.

GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REMUNERAt ION REPORt Statement of directors' shareholdings and share interests
Minimum Shareholding Requirement (MSR)
Executive directors are compulsorily required to establish and maintain a minimum personal shareholding equal to a set percentage of base 
salary. An Initial Value must be achieved as quickly as possible using shares vesting or options exercised through the executive share option 
schemes and Long-Term Incentive schemes by retaining 50% of the net value (i.e. the value after deduction of exercise costs and tax) of shares 
acquired under these schemes. Once the Initial Value is achieved, a Subsequent Value must be achieved in the same way, except that a minimum 
of 25% of the net value must be retained on each exercise or acquisition. Shares owned beneficially by the director and his/her spouse count 
towards the MSR. The MSR does not apply after the individual has ceased to be a director. Any case of non-compliance would be dealt with by 
the Committee. 
The following table sets out MSR Initial Value and Subsequent Value: 
Director Initial Value Subsequent Value
Ian King 150% 300%
Peter Lynas 100% 200%
Linda Hudson 175% 350%
Ian King and Peter Lynas were both in excess of their  Subsequent Value' MSR at 31 December 2013. Following the announcement in 2013 of 
Linda Hudson's forthcoming retirement, the Committee agreed to reduce her MSR to 175% and she subsequently retained a holding to that level.
There are no shareholding requirements for the Chairman or the non-executive directors.
Share interests as at 31 December 2013 (or on ceasing to be a director of the Company)
The interests of the directors who served during the year ended 31 December 2013 (or earlier date of cessation as a director) in the shares of

BAE Sy St EmS ANNuAL REPORT 2013 103 The non-executive directors' fees are set by the Non-Executive Directors' Fees Committee which, during 2013, comprised Sir Richard Olver,

Directors' remuneration in the year ending 31 December 2014
As stated in the Committee Chairman's letter on page 81, for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006, the Policy will take legal effect on 
1 January 2015. We intend in practice to operate the Directors' remuneration policy from the 2014 AGM. As detailed in the Committee Chairman's 
statement on page 81, the salaries of the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director remain unchanged in 2014, and the remuneration 
package for the newly appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc. is set out on page 98. The performance measures 
and weightings for 2014 for the Annual Incentive and Long-Term Incentives are set out in the Directors' remuneration policy on pages 83 to 85. 
The Committee is of the view that bonus targets for the Annual Incentive are commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the 
Company to disclose them before the start of the financial year. The targets will be disclosed retrospectively after the end of the relevant 
financial year.
