 This report, which has been approved by the Board, has been prepared pursuant to the Companies Act 1985 as amended
by the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The Board is responsible for setting the overall policy to be adopted on Directors' remuneration with the Remuneration and
Nominations Committee then applying the policy when setting individual remuneration packages. The Board considers that
it has complied with the best practice provisions of the Combined Code with respect to Directors' remuneration.
Remuneration and Nominations Committee
The Remuneration and Nominations Committee comprises Mr Charles Fisher (Chairman), together with Mr John Gough, 
Mr Rupert Soames and Mr Alexander Ward, and the Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee. The Committee
consults the Chief Executive, who may be invited to attend meetings. None of the members of the Committee has any
personal financial interest (other than as shareholders) in the matters considered by the Committee. The activities and
responsibilities of the Committee, which meets as required, are set out in separate terms of reference agreed by the Board.
Remuneration policy
The Committee determines the remuneration policy for executive directors and senior employees having regard to the
objectives of the Company and information in respect of compensation and salary levels in other companies of similar 
size, for executives with similar skills, qualifications and experience. The policy is and will in the future be formulated:-
- to align the rewards and incentives of senior executives with the interests of shareholders; 
- to provide remuneration packages which will attract, retain and motivate executives of an appropriate calibre and
reward them for their contribution to the business; and
- to reduce the proportion of fixed remuneration and provide for a proportion of incentive pay dependant on results.
The performance conditions attached to individual elements of Directors' remuneration are summarised on pages 17 to 19.
Incentive schemes
The Company operates annual and long-term incentive schemes.
The annual scheme
Under the annual incentive scheme the Executive Directors can earn up to 50 per cent of annual salary depending on the
Company's achievement against profitability targets set by the Committee based on a formula which takes account of the
overall UK brick market for the year.
The long-term incentive scheme
The long-term incentive scheme provides for payments of up to 35 per cent of salary by reference to growth in earnings 
per share over a three year period; the maximum payment only becomes payable if the average annual compound growth
in earnings per share over the three years exceeds RPI by 10 per cent or more. No amount is payable if compound growth
in earnings does not exceed RPI. The entitlement for each Director is based on a notional pool equivalent to 35 per cent 
of his base salary at the commencement of each three year period and the amount ultimately payable is based on the
audited results for the third year after establishment of the pool. These performance conditions were chosen to reflect the
importance of earnings per share as one of the determinants of the market price of the Company's shares, thus helping to
align the interests of the executives with those of the Company's shareholders.
The potential incentive earnings for each Director under the long term incentive scheme are as follows:- 
Potential long term incentive earnings in the years ending
30th September 2004 30th September 2005 30th September 2006
A. M. Baxter  0 to  46,760  0 to  52,500  0 to  54,338
M. P. Haines  0 to  36,785  0 to  37,800  0 to  39,113

For shareholders' information, the Company's total shareholder return performance, assuming dividends were re-invested,
for the five years ended 30th September 2003 is shown in the graph below compared to the return performance achieved
by the FTSE Small Cap index, which has been chosen because it is a broad and widely used equity market index.
Service agreements
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts and do not participate in any bonus, pension or share option
schemes of the Company.
Both Alan Baxter and Martyn Haines entered into contracts of service with the Company on 12th November 1998 
requiring up to two years' notice of termination on either side, the period of notice increasing to three years in the event of
a change in control of the Company. In the event of early termination by the Company the executives would be entitled to
compensation equivalent to the full value of their prospective emoluments for the unexpired period of the contract, though
they would be subject to restrictive covenants for such periods in respect of competitive activities. There is, however, a
mitigation clause which would have the effect of reducing any notice period by a percentage depending on the age of the
executive at the time of termination. Although Alan Baxter's contract is due to terminate on 8th August 2004, when he will
attain the age of 60, the Board have agreed with him that his contract will continue beyond that date with the contractual
notice period of 12 months on either side. 
The Committee believe that these contracts are reasonable bearing in mind the need to retain experienced directors with
specialist knowledge of the industry and to encourage them to develop long term strategies for the Company. However, in
view of the Combined Code the Committee will, other than in exceptional circumstances, restrict notice periods for any
new appointments to one year.
The Auditors are required to report on the information set out below and on page 19.
