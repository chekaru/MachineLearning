 This report, which has been approved by the Board, has been prepared pursuant to the Companies Act 1985 as amended
by the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The Board is responsible for setting the overall policy to be adopted on Directors' remuneration, with the Remuneration
and Nominations Committee then applying the policy when setting individual remuneration packages. The Board considers
that it has complied with the best practice provisions of the Combined Code with respect to Directors' remuneration.
Remuneration and Nominations Committee
The Remuneration and Nominations Committee comprises Mr Charles Fisher (Chairman), together with Mr Alexander
Ward, Mr Rupert Soames and Mr Ian Fleming, and the Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee. The Committee
consults the Chief Executive, who may be invited to attend meetings. None of the members of the Committee has any
personal financial interest (other than as shareholders) in the matters considered by the Committee. The activities and
responsibilities of the Committee, which meets as required, are set out in separate terms of reference agreed by the Board.
Remuneration policy
The Committee determines the remuneration policy for both executive and non-executive directors and senior employees,
having regard to the objectives of the Company and information in respect of compensation and salary levels in other
companies of similar size, for executives with similar skills, qualifications and experience. The policy is and will in the
future be formulated:-
- to align the rewards and incentives of senior executives with the interests of shareholders;
- to provide remuneration packages which will attract, retain and motivate executives of an appropriate calibre and
reward them for their contribution to the business; and
- to reduce the proportion of fixed remuneration and provide for a proportion of incentive pay dependant on results.
Incentive schemes
The Company operates annual and long-term incentive schemes.
The annual scheme
Under the annual incentive scheme the Executive Directors can earn up to 50 per cent of annual salary depending on the
Company's achievement against profitability targets based on a formula which takes account of the strength of the overall
UK brick market for the year.
The long-term incentive scheme
The long-term incentive scheme provides for payments of up to 35 per cent of salary by reference to growth in earnings per
share over a three year period; the maximum payment only becomes payable if the average annual compound growth in
earnings per share over the three years exceeds RPI by 10 per cent or more. No amount is payable if compound growth 
in earnings does not exceed RPI. The entitlement for each Director is based on a notional pool equivalent to 35 per cent 
of his base salary at the commencement of each three year period and the amount ultimately payable is based on the
audited results for the third year after establishment of the pool. These performance conditions were chosen to reflect the
importance of earnings per share as one of the determinants of the market price of the Company's shares, thus helping 
to align the interests of the executives with those of the Company's shareholders.
The potential incentive earnings for each Director under the long term incentive scheme are as follows:-
Potential long term incentive earnings in the years ending
30th September 2005 30th September 2006 30th September 2007
A. M. Baxter  0 to  52,500  0 to  54,338  0 to  56,000

For shareholders' information, the Company's total shareholder return performance, assuming dividends were re-invested,
for the five years ended 30th September 2004 is shown in the graph below compared to the return performance achieved
by the FTSE Small Cap index, which has been chosen because it is a broad and widely used equity market index.
Service agreements
The Non-executive Directors do not have service agreements and do not participate in any bonus, pension or share option
schemes of the Company.
Mr A. M. Baxter had a service agreement with the Company which specified a normal retirement age of 60. Although
Mr Baxter attained the age of 60 on 8th August 2004, at the request of the Board he agreed to remain in his position subject
to a revised contractual notice period of 12 months on either side. Mr M.P. Haines entered into a contract of service in 1998
requiring up to two years' notice of termination on either side. There is a mitigation clause which has the effect of reducing
any notice period by a percentage depending on age, such that the current effective notice period for Mr Haines is 21 months.
In the event of early termination by the Company compensation would be payable equivalent to the full value of the
prospective emoluments for the unexpired effective notice period and there are restrictive covenants in respect of competing
activities. In the event of a change in control of the Company the period of notice would increase by 50 per cent.
The Committee believe that these contractual arrangements are reasonable taking account of the need to retain
experienced Directors with specialist knowledge of the industry and to encourage the development of long term strategies
for the Company. However, in view of the Combined Code, the Committee will, other than in exceptional circumstances,
restrict notice periods for any new appointments to one year.
The Auditors are required to report on the information set out below and on page 19.

participate. Options granted to Directors over ordinary shares of 25p under these schemes are set out below.

The mid-market price of the shares at 30th September 2004 was 143.5p and the range during the year was 121.5p to 180.0p.
The exercise of the option over 130,000 shares at 98p each granted to Mr Baxter is subject to a performance condition which
stipulates that the option can only be exercised if there has been an increase in earnings per share over a three year period
commencing after 1st October 1997 in excess of 6 per cent plus the increase in RPI. The lapsed options for Mr Baxter and 
Mr Haines were not exercised because it was felt that it was preferable, in the wider interests of shareholders, to make cash
payments to Mr Baxter and Mr Haines equivalent to the net financial benefit which they would otherwise have received.
