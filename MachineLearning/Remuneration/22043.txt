 This report, which has been approved by the Board, has been prepared pursuant to the Companies Act 1985 as amended
by the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The Board is responsible for setting the overall policy to be adopted on Directors' remuneration, with the Remuneration
Committee then applying the policy when setting individual remuneration packages. The Board considers that it has
complied with the best practice provisions of the Combined Code with respect to Directors' remuneration.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Mr Rupert Soames (Chairman), together with Mr Alexander Ward and 
Mr Ian Fleming, and the Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee. The Committee consults the Chief Executive,
who may be invited to attend meetings. None of the members of the Committee has any personal financial interest 
(other than as a shareholder) in the matters considered by the Committee. The activities and responsibilities of the
Committee, which meets as required, are set out in separate terms of reference agreed by the Board.
Remuneration policy
The Committee determines the remuneration policy for both executive and non-executive directors and senior employees,
having regard to the objectives of the Company and information in respect of compensation and salary levels in other
companies of similar size, for executives with similar skills, qualifications and experience. The policy is and will in the
future be formulated:-
- to align the rewards and incentives of senior executives with the interests of shareholders; 
- to provide remuneration packages which will attract, retain and motivate executives of an appropriate calibre and
reward them for their contribution to the business; and
- to reduce the proportion of fixed remuneration and provide for a proportion of incentive pay dependent on results.
Incentive schemes
The Company operates annual and long-term incentive schemes.
The annual scheme
Under the annual incentive scheme, the Executive Directors can earn up to 50 per cent of annual salary depending on the
Company's achievement against profitability targets based on a formula which takes account of UK brick sales for the year.
The long-term incentive scheme
The long-term incentive scheme provides for payments of up to 35 per cent of salary by reference to growth in earnings 
per share over a three year period; the maximum payment only becomes payable if the average annual compound growth
in earnings per share over the three years exceeds RPI by 10 per cent or more. No amount is payable if compound growth
in earnings does not exceed RPI. The entitlement for each Director is based on a notional pool equivalent to 35 per cent 
of his base salary at the commencement of each three year period and the amount ultimately payable is based on the
audited results for the third year after establishment of the pool. These performance conditions were chosen to reflect the
importance of earnings per share as one of the determinants of the market price of the Company's shares, thus helping to
align the interests of the executives with those of the Company's shareholders.
The potential incentive earnings for each Director under the long term incentive scheme are as follows:- 
Potential long term incentive earnings in the years ending
30th September 2006 30th September 2007 30th September 2008
A. M. Baxter  0 to  54,338  0 to  56,000  0 to  57,400

Mr A. M. Baxter waived salary amounting to  4,800 during the year. Separately, the Company made a contribution of  4,800
towards a personal pension plan.
Service agreements
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts, though Mr Fleming has a letter of appointment, and they 
do not participate in any bonus, pension or share option schemes of the Company.
Mr A. M. Baxter had a service agreement with the Company which specified a normal retirement age of 60. Although 
Mr Baxter attained the age of 60 on 8th August 2004, at the request of the Board he agreed to remain in his position
subject to a revised contractual notice period of 12 months on either side. Mr M. P. Haines has a contract of service
requiring up to two years' notice of termination on either side. There is a mitigation clause which has the effect of reducing
any notice period by a percentage depending on age, such that the current effective notice period for Mr Haines is 21.6
months. In the event of early termination by the Company, compensation would be payable equivalent to the full value of
the prospective emoluments for the unexpired effective notice period and there are restrictive covenants in respect of
competing activities. In the event of a change of control of the Company, the period of notice would increase by 50 per cent.

The Committee believe that these contractual arrangements are reasonable taking account of past commitments made by
the Company to Mr Haines and his experience and knowledge of the Industry. However, in view of the Combined Code,
the Committee will, other than in exceptional circumstances, restrict notice periods for any new appointments to one year.
Share options
Outstanding options to Directors under the Baggeridge Brick 1989 Executive Share Option Scheme were as follows:-

The mid-market price of the shares at 30th September 2005 was 168.0p and the range during the year was 144.5p to 200.5p.
The exercise of the option over 130,000 shares at 98p each granted to Mr Baxter is subject to a performance condition

Mr Baxter ceased to be a contributing member of the Baggeridge Brick Plc Pension and Life Assurance Scheme (the
Scheme ) in 2004 on attaining the age of 60, when he became entitled to a pension equivalent to two-thirds of his then
salary. No subsequent contributions to the Scheme have been made by him or by the Company on his behalf. In the 
case of Mr Baxter, the quoted transfer values are notional, as he has passed his normal retirement date. The figures for 
Mr Baxter in the above table have not increased due to service accrual but with late retirement and actuarial assumptions
taking account of his decision to defer his pension. Separately, the Company did contribute  4,800 during the year towards
a personal pension plan.
Mr Haines is entitled to a defined benefit pension as a member of the Scheme and contributes 5 per cent of salary. Pension
entitlement is calculated only on the basic salary element of remuneration. The accrued pension shown above is that which
has been earned to date, payable from the normal retirement date.
