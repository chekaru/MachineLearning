 This report, which has been approved by the Board, has been prepared pursuant to the Companies Act 1985 as amended
by the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The Board is responsible for setting the overall policy to be adopted on Directors' remuneration, with the Remuneration
Committee then applying the policy when setting individual remuneration packages. The Board considers that it has
complied with the best practice provisions of the Combined Code with respect to Directors' remuneration.
Remuneration Committee
Prior to 14th February 2006 the Remuneration Committee comprised Mr Rupert Soames (Chairman), together with 
Mr Alexander Ward and Mr Ian Fleming, Mr Fleming assuming the role of Chairman on Mr Soames' retirement from the
Board on that date. The Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee. The Committee consults the Chief Executive,
who may be invited to attend meetings. None of the members of the Committee has any personal financial interest (other
than as a shareholder) in the matters considered by the Committee. The activities and responsibilities of the Committee,
which meets as required, are set out in separate terms of reference agreed by the Board.
Remuneration policy
The Committee determines the remuneration policy for both Executive and Non-executive Directors and senior employees,
having regard to the objectives of the Company and information in respect of compensation and salary levels in other
companies of similar size, for executives with similar skills, qualifications and experience. The policy is and will in the
future be formulated:-
- to align the rewards and incentives of senior executives with the interests of shareholders; 
- to provide remuneration packages which will attract, retain and motivate executives of an appropriate calibre and
reward them for their contribution to the business; and
- to reduce the proportion of fixed remuneration and provide for a proportion of incentive pay dependent on results.
Incentive schemes
The Company operates annual and long-term incentive schemes.
The annual scheme
Under the annual incentive scheme, the Executive Directors can earn up to 50 per cent of annual salary depending on 
the Company's achievement against profitability targets set by the Remuneration Committee.
The long-term incentive scheme
The long-term incentive scheme provides for payments of up to 35 per cent of salary by reference to growth in earnings 
per share over a three year period; the maximum payment only becomes payable if the average annual compound growth
in earnings per share over the three years exceeds RPI by 10 per cent or more. No amount is payable if compound growth
in earnings does not exceed RPI. The entitlement for each Director is based on a notional pool equivalent to 35 per cent 
of his base salary at the commencement of each three year period and the amount ultimately payable is based on the
audited results for the third year after establishment of the pool. These performance conditions were chosen to reflect the
importance of earnings per share as one of the determinants of the market price of the Company's shares, thus helping to
align the interests of the executives with those of the Company's shareholders.
The potential incentive earnings for each Director under the long term incentive scheme are as follows:- 
Potential long term incentive earnings in the years ending

A. M. Baxter  0 to  56,000  0 to  57,400  0 to  59,150

The Auditor is required to report on the information contained in the above table.
Service agreements
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts, though Mr Fleming has a letter of appointment, and they do
not participate in any bonus, pension or share option schemes of the Company.
Mr A. M. Baxter has a service agreement with the Company entered into in 1998 which specifies a contractual notice
period of 12 months on either side. Mr M. P. Haines has a contract of service entered into in 1998 requiring up to two
years' notice of termination on either side. There is a mitigation clause which has the effect of reducing his notice period by
a percentage depending on age, such that the current effective notice period for Mr Haines is 22.2 months. In the event of
early termination of the above contracts by the Company, compensation would be payable equivalent to the full value of the
prospective emoluments for the unexpired effective notice period and there are restrictive covenants in respect of competing
activities. In the event of a change of control of the Company, the period of notice would increase by 50 per cent.

The Committee believes that these contractual arrangements are reasonable taking account of past commitments made by
the Company to Mr Haines and his experience and knowledge of the Industry. However, in view of the Combined Code,
the Committee will, other than in exceptional circumstances, restrict notice periods for any new appointments to no more
than one year.
