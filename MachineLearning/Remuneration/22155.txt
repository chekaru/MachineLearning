re-elected in 2000 and Mr Eckersall was elected in 2001.
Directors' interests
No Director had any material interest in any contract of significance with the
Group during the period under review. The interests of Directors in the share
capital of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings are set out in Note 21(b)
on page 56 and under the long-term incentive scheme (the Performance Share
Plan 2001), and in respect of options over such share capital, in the tables in the
remuneration report beginning on page 35.
Share capital and major shareholders 
Details of the share capital of the Company as at 31 December 2002 are set 
out in Note 17 beginning on page 53. During the year to 31 December 2002
no ordinary shares were repurchased for cancellation and 5,000,000 preference
shares (representing 3.0% of the preference share capital) were repurchased for
cancellation for a total consideration of  6,835,000 at an average price of
136.7p. 568,658 ordinary shares were issued following the exercise of options
held under the Company's Savings-Related Share Option Scheme and 
386,256 ordinary shares were issued following the exercise of options held
under the Company's Executive Share Option Scheme. No other shares were
issued during the year.

Sections 198 to 208 of the Companies Act 1985 of the following interests in its
ordinary share capital:
Fidelity International Limited 31.3m shares 7.53%
Aviva plc 29.1m shares 7.00%
Morley Fund Management Limited

HBOS plc 17.2m shares 4.15%
Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Group plc 16.8m shares 4.05%
Prudential plc 15.4m shares 3.72%
Activities
The Chairman's statement and Chief Executive's review on pages 02 to 07, the
Operating review on pages 10 to 25, and the Financial review on pages 26 and
27 report on the principal activities of the Group, its operations during 2002
and future developments in its businesses.
Dividends
The Directors recommend a final dividend on ordinary shares of 3.05p (net) per
share, making, with the interim dividend of 2.35p, a total dividend for 2002 of
5.4p (net). Preference dividends totalling 10.75p (gross) per preference share
have been paid for 2002.
Dialogue with shareholders
The Company has a long-established programme of regular communication
with institutional investors and brokers. Presentations are made to brokers'
analysts, the press and institutional investors at the time of the announcement
of final and half-year results and there are regular meetings with analysts and
investors throughout the year, which are organised through the Company's
brokers, so that the investment community can be kept informed of longer term
strategic matters and can communicate their views to executive management.
We expect to continue this programme, within the constraints of relevant
legislation and practice. The Group's website is at www.balfourbeatty.com 
and is a regular channel of communication with shareholders and others.
Directors
Details of the Directors of the Company are given on pages 28 and 29. All the
Directors shown served throughout the year, with the exception of Anthony
Rabin and Alastair Wivell, who were each appointed as executive Directors 
on 9 July 2002, and Richard Delbridge and Sir David Wright, who were each
appointed a non-executive Director on 24 October 2002 and 1 January 2003
respectively. During the year, Michael Miles retired as a non-executive Director
following the Annual General Meeting on 16 May 2002, and Paul Lester
resigned his position as executive Director on 28 June 2002 following his
appointment as Chief Executive of VT Group plc. Ian Tyler was appointed 
to the new post of Chief Operating Officer on 14 August 2002.
Selection of non-executive Directors
Our non-executive Directors have, for some years, been chosen on the basis of
their individual background and experience for the contribution they can make
both generally and in specific areas relevant to our business. Thus, Christopher
Reeves, and now Richard Delbridge, bring to us City and financial experience 
at the highest level: Sir David John brings the experience of leading large
international companies: Udo Stark contributes the background knowledge of
business in Germany, where we have important interests: Sir David Wright, as a
former head of British Trade International, has extensive knowledge of overseas
markets and particularly the Far East: and Rob Walvis brings the benefit of wide
experience drawn from a career in senior positions at Shell.
Candidates are identified by a combination of using both outside
consultants and the wide range of personal contacts at senior level which the
Board members have between them. An independent outlook is an essential
qualification for selection. Balfour Beatty plc

- The Chief Executive's Committee
This committee, which comprises executive Directors, considers proposed 
capital expenditure, investments and divestments up to fixed limits, above 
which the matter is referred to the Board.
Standing committees of the Board are also established to consider such
matters as banking issues and the administration of share options. 
The membership of these committees, all of which have their own written
terms of reference, in practice comprises executive Directors with a specific
minimum quorum. 
Risk management
The Board takes ultimate responsibility for the Group's systems of internal risk
management and control and reviews their effectiveness on an annual basis
(Code para D.2.1). The Board considers that the Group's systems and controls
are appropriately designed to ensure that the Group's exposure to significant
risk is properly managed, but recognises that any system of internal control
can only reduce and not eliminate the risk of loss.
The Audit Committee, the workings of which have been described, is
responsible for ensuring the effective working and regular review of the Group's
internal systems and controls.
The basis of the Group's system of internal control is the risk management
framework. This framework accords with the Turnbull Guidance on Internal
Controls and was in place throughout the year and up to the date of signing
the Annual Report. The framework is applied to all functions in the Group,
whether operational, financial or support. Under it, the key risks facing each
part of the Group are regularly reviewed and assessed, together with the steps
to avoid or mitigate those risks. The results of those reviews are placed on risk
registers and, where necessary, specific action plans are developed. The registers
are required to be updated on a regular basis, and the reporting procedures laid
down ensure a continuing flow of risk information to the Audit Committee and
the Board.
The Group's systems of internal control are operated in a number of 
different ways:
  by the Internal Audit team, which carries out programmed reviews and tests
of critical business processes and controls and conducts spot checks in areas
of perceived high business risk. The Head of Group Audit maintains a direct
reporting line to the chairman of the Audit Committee;
  by the individual tender and project review procedures, which commence at
operating Company level and progress to Board Committee level if value or
perceived exposure reaches certain amounts;
  by the monthly financial reporting against budgets and the review of results
and forecasts;
  by the regular monitoring, review and reporting of health, safety and
environmental matters;
  by the review and authorisation of proposed investment, divestment and
capital expenditure through the Chief Executive's Committee and the Board;
  by specific policies set out in the Group Finance manual, covering banking
and treasury matters including arrangements with the Group's bankers and
bond providers, controls on foreign exchange dealings and management of
currency exposures;
  by regular risk reviews by executive Directors and line management of
particular areas of business or particular projects, which are used to update
both management's understanding of the risk environment in which the
Group operates and the methods used to mitigate and control the risks
identified; and
  by management ensuring the free and regular flow of information internally
and the formulation and review of properly documented policies and
procedures in relation to new or changing risk areas.
Corporate governance
Overview 
The Board continues to endorse and apply the principles of good corporate
governance reflected in the Combined Code appended to the Listing Rules of
the Financial Services Authority. The Company has complied with all the Code
provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code throughout the financial
year ended 31 December 2002 save, as in the previous year, the Company has
not complied with provision A.2.1 of the Code to identify a separate senior
independent Director for disclosure in the Annual Report. The Directors 
remain firmly of the view that this is unnecessary on account of having a 
non-executive Chairman, a separate Chief Executive and an experienced and
independent Chairman of the Audit Committee.
The Board and its Committees 
The Board comprises seven executive and seven non-executive Directors,
including the Chairman. The Board generally meets once a month to consider
matters specifically reserved for its attention and decision. The Board has
established procedures which are designed to ensure that Directors are
appropriately briefed on issues to be discussed at meetings. Board papers are
circulated sufficiently in advance of meetings to allow time to consider the
adequacy of the information provided for decision making. Certain of the
responsibilities of the Board are delegated to Board Committees, each of
which has specific written terms of reference. 
The main committees are:
- The Audit Committee
The membership of this committee, which is chaired by Mr Reeves, is comprised
of all the non-executive Directors. Meetings are attended by external auditors,
the Head of Internal Audit and the Finance Director, at the invitation of the
committee chairman.
The committee holds at least three meetings a year, two of which are
held prior to the Board's approval of the interim and final financial results
respectively and a third is held, customarily, in May after the AGM. The Audit
Committee provides, among other things, an important forum for regular and
formal communication between the Group's external and internal auditors.
  The terms of reference of the Audit Committee give it the power to 
consult external auditors without executive Directors being present, to 
obtain independent advice, to avail itself of appropriate training, and to seek
information from any employee. Its primary task, as required by its terms of
reference, is to review the accounts of the Company before they go to the
Board for approval, including the accounting policies applied, judgements
and adjustments made and any conflicts of interest. The committee has also
the specific responsibility to consider the selection, appointment and
dismissal of the external auditors, as well as to assess the relative scope of
their work, the extent of their non audit services, their level of remuneration
and their independence.
  The committee is also charged with reviewing the Company' s compliance
with the T urnbull Guidance on Internal Controls, the policies employed in the
Company for identifying and managing business risk, the effectiveness of any
corrective action by management and the reports from the internal audit
function on the effectiveness of the risk management systems in the Group.
This aspect is dealt with at greater length under Risk management  below.
- The Business Practices Committee
The membership of this committee, which is chaired by Sir David John, is
identical to that of the Audit Committee. It meets at least three times a year,
generally following meetings of the Audit Committee. Its terms of reference
enable it to discuss all aspects of the Group's business practice, including in
particular, health, safety, ethical and environmental matters. Its meetings are
attended, through invitation, by the director of Safety, Health and the
Environment. 
- The Compensation and Appointments Committee
The membership of this committee, which is chaired by Viscount Weir, is 
also identical to that of the Audit Committee. The role of this committee 
is described at greater length in the remuneration report beginning on page 32.
- The Group Tender Committee
This committee, which in practice comprises executive Directors only, considers
major tenders before their submission. Where an opportunity to tender for a
project is either of unusual size or exposure, it is also considered by the Board 
as a whole. Balfour Beatty plc

Directors' report continued
Annual incentive plan
Each executive Director participates in an annual incentive plan, under which
predetermined financial targets must be achieved before any payment is earned.
The maximum potential bonus which could have been earned by executive
Directors for 2002 was 50% of salary and the performance indicator chosen
was profit before tax, exceptional items and goodwill amortisation. Based on
the performance of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2002, each
executive Director earned a bonus of 31.5% of salary. Precise figures are shown
in the table on page 34. These bonuses are payable in cash, after deduction of
tax, and are non pensionable. For 2003 a similar bonus structure will operate
with the maximum potential bonus again being 50% of salary. 
For subsequent years, the CAC will continue to review the competitiveness 
and structure of the annual incentive plan.
Long-term incentive scheme 
In 2001 the Company obtained shareholder approval for a Performance Share
Plan (Plan ), a long-term incentive scheme which is entirely performance
related. Following agreement by the CAC, conditional awards were made in
2001 and again in 2002. Under the Plan, executive Directors and key senior
managers may receive ordinary shares in the Company up to a maximum
number equivalent in market value to their basic salaries at the date 
of award. Details of awards to executive Directors are shown in the first table
on page 35. These shares will be transferred to the executive Director and vest
only if, and to the extent that, an earnings per share growth target is met 
over a three year performance period. 
For the 2002 award, the extent to which this target is achieved over the 
three year period ending 31 December 2004 will determine the number of
shares (if any) to which a Director will be entitled. The maximum award of
shares is made only where the Company's earnings per share before exceptional
items and goodwill amortisation (EPS ) increases by at least 100% in this
period. If EPS growth is 30% over the period, the Directors will be entitled to
30% of the maximum number of shares. If EPS growth is between 30% and
100%, the number of shares awarded will be pro rata to actual growth. 
No shares can be awarded if EPS growth is less than 30%, and there is no
provision for retesting.
EPS growth was chosen as the performance measure because it was and
remains a key objective, since continuing growth in the Company's EPS should
logically be reflected in growth in the share price and dividends and, therefore,
increased returns to shareholders. The importance of EPS growth is well
understood by the Directors and those other senior managers who participate 
in the Plan. The CAC believes that the present management team contributes
directly to achieving EPS growth and is positively motivated by the Plan. It is,
therefore, the intention of the CAC to retain EPS growth as the performance
measure for awards under the Plan for 2003.
The Plan was approved at the 2001 Annual General Meeting for a period
of five years and, unless circumstances change significantly, the CAC intends to
make further conditional awards under the Plan in 2003 and also anticipates
doing so in 2004 and 2005. It would then be the intention to submit proposals
for future long-term incentive arrangements to shareholders for approval at the
2006 Annual General Meeting.
Remuneration report
Compensation and Appointments Committee
The Compensation and Appointments Committee of the Board (CAC ) is
responsible for determining the remuneration policy and conditions of service
for the executive Directors. It is also responsible for making recommendations to
the Board for the appointment of executive Directors.
The CAC comprises all the non-executive Directors, whose names can 
be found on page 28, and is chaired by Viscount Weir. Mike Welton, the 
Chief Executive, is invited to join its meetings whenever appropriate, and 
Peter Johnson, the director of personnel, attends as secretary. 
No member of the CAC has any personal financial interest, other than as a
shareholder, in the matters to be decided by the CAC, nor potential conflicts of
interest arising from cross-directorships, and no member of the CAC has any
day to day involvement in the executive management of the Group.
During 2002, advice and assistance has been provided by the Monks
Partnership (Monks ), New Bridge Street Consultants (NBSC ) and 
Mr Johnson. Mr Welton attended part of one meeting, by invitation, in
connection with the appointment of additional executive Directors and has 
also, separately, made recommendations in connection with executive Directors'
salaries, other than his own.
Monks and NBSC were each appointed by the CAC to provide
independent advice and assistance to it. Monks has also provided data and
advice to the Company regarding the remuneration of senior management
below the level of executive Director, and carried out a comparative salary survey
of key positions for one of the Group's operating businesses. NBSC has provided
the Company with remuneration data in connection with a US-based senior
executive position.
Directors' remuneration
General policy
The policy of the CAC is to pay competitive basic salaries to facilitate the
recruitment and retention of high calibre management so as to ensure that 
the Company performs to its potential and increases shareholder value. 
Annual bonuses and long-term incentive schemes are also seen as an important
part of each Director's total remuneration and are used to drive and reward
performance. The CAC aims to achieve an approximately even balance between
basic salaries and performance related incentive arrangements and has sought
to reflect this policy in the current remuneration packages. Executive Directors
are invited to participate in the same pension schemes as other executives.
Basic salaries
In setting the basic salaries of executive Directors, the CAC obtains data and
independent advice from Monks and NBSC on the remuneration levels in 
FTSE 250 companies taking into account the broad business sectors in which
the Company operates, its market capitalisation and its annual turnover. 
The CAC used this market data, together with its own judgement of the
performance of the Group's businesses and the contribution made by individual
Directors, in determining basic salary increases implemented on 1 July 2002
which averaged 8.2%. The CAC intends to adopt a similar approach in July
2003 and for the foreseeable future. Balfour Beatty plc 
Annual report and accounts 2002
33
The CAC believes in setting challenging performance targets and, as a result, 
in both 2001 and 2002 the maximum award under the Plan was linked to an
EPS growth target of 100%. The CAC remains committed to establishing
demanding targets for 2003 and for future years but recognises, however, 
that if such performance targets are to have a proper incentive effect they 
also need to be realistic and achievable. The CAC therefore intends to take
account of such factors as growth already achieved and future business
prospects so as to ensure a sensible balance in determining the upper target 
at which the maximum award is made and the minimum level below which 
no award is made.
No performance period under the Plan has yet been completed. 
Once a period is completed, the internal calculation of EPS growth will be
independently verified before the CAC recommends to the Trustee of the 
Plan to make any transfers of shares. 
Executive share options
Prior to the establishment of the Performance Share Plan, grants of options
over ordinary shares were made to executive Directors, some of which 
remain valid and unexercised. Details of these and the relevant performance
conditions appear in the second table beginning on page 35. It is now the
CAC's policy that, save in exceptional circumstances, for example to attract 
an outstanding individual, further awards of options will not be made to
executive Directors who, in the same year, participate in the Plan. No executive
options have therefore been granted to executive Directors since April 2000
and it is not intended that any executive options will be granted to executive
Directors in 2003. 
The CAC determines whether or not the performance conditions are
satisfied in accordance with the Rules of the Scheme. This determination is
made following independent verification of the internal calculations. 
Savings-related options
Performance conditions are not applied to savings-related share options 
since the schemes are open to all employees based in the UK, including
executive Directors.
Scheme rule amendments
No amendments to the Rules of the Executive Share Option Scheme 2001, 
the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme 2001, or the Performance Share
Plan 2001, have been made and none are currently proposed. All of these
schemes received shareholder approval at the 2001 Annual General Meeting. 
Notice periods
Since 1999, it has been the Company' s policy and practice to include in executive
Directors' contracts a 12 month rolling notice period from the Company and six
months' notice on the part of the Director. This policy will continue in the future. 
T wo executive Directors, namely Mr Welton and Mr Zinkin, who have been
Directors since 1996 and 1991 respectively (and employees for much longer 
than that) have service contracts which provide for notice periods from the
Company of 24 months. The CAC has considered this matter in some detail 
and notes the views of many shareholders regarding the inappropriateness of 
24 month notice periods. The CAC is also mindful that Mr Welton and Mr Zinkin
are long serving employees - Mr Welton joined in 1978 and Mr Zinkin in 1981,
that their existing contracts of employment were freely entered into some years
ago, and that their contribution to the Company has been, and continues to 
be, substantial. The CAC does not believe that it would be appropriate, or in
shareholders' interests, to make a compensatory payment to reduce these notice
periods, nor would it expect the two Directors voluntarily to reduce their existing
notice periods without some form of compensation. For these reasons, no
alteration to these notice periods is proposed. However, if an opportunity arises
in the future to bring these notice periods into line with those of other executive
Directors, the CAC would review the situation with the Directors concerned.
None of the service contracts of executive Directors includes provision for
specific payment in the event of early termination, nor do they provide for
extended notice periods in the event of a change of control. It is not the CAC' s
intention to introduce such provisions. If any existing contract of employment
is breached by the Company in the event of termination, the Company would
be liable to pay, as damages, an amount approximating to the net loss of
salary and contractual benefits for the unexpired notice period. The CAC will
seek to ensure that the Director fulfils his obligation to mitigate his losses and
will also give consideration to phased payments where appropriate.
Details of the service contracts of the executive Directors are shown in the
table below.

Directors' report continued
Remuneration report continued
Non-executive Directors 
Non-executive Directors are appointed by the full Board which also determines
the terms on which their services are provided. Non-executive Directors are
appointed for a term of three years at a time unless required earlier to submit
for re-election under the rotational provisions of the Articles of Association of
the Company. They do not have service contracts, are not eligible to join any
Balfour Beatty pension fund and cannot participate in any of the Company's
share option, annual incentive or long-term incentive schemes. None of the
appointment letters for non-executive Directors contain provision for specific
payment in the event of termination for whatever cause. 
The fees of the non-executive Directors are reviewed from time to time,
the last review having been undertaken by the Board in June 2002. The Board
considered comparative data supplied by Monks, and the fact that the last
increase took place on 1 January 2000, and agreed that non-executive Directors'
fees should be increased from  25,000 to  30,000 per annum, with effect from 
1 July 2002. The Chairman, who is non-executive, did not receive any increase
in his fee in 2002 and has not received an increase since his fee was originally
agreed on his becoming Chairman in 1996. No additional fees are currently
payable to non-executive Directors for chairing Board committees but, since
September 2001, Mr Stark has also received a E30,000 per annum fee from
Balfour Beatty Rail GmbH for his chairmanship of the supervisory board of that
company, which is based in Munich. 
Performance graph
The graph opposite shows Balfour Beatty's Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
performance compared to the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment
companies) TSR over the five financial years ended 31 December 2002. 
The values indicated in the graph show the share price growth plus reinvested
dividends from a  100 hypothetical holding of ordinary shares in Balfour
Beatty plc and in the index at the start of the period and have been calculated
using 30 trading day average values.
The CAC has elected to compare the TSR on the Company's ordinary shares
against the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment companies). This is a broad
index, and the Company is a constituent member of it. The CAC has concluded
that it would have been less meaningful to use a narrower index such as the
Construction & Building Materials Index for comparison purposes. Although this
index includes direct competitors, it also includes house builders, aggregate and
other building material suppliers, but does not include companies in the support
services sector in which the Company is active. The CAC therefore concluded
that this index did not provide a better comparator group than the broader 
FTSE 250 Index.

Notes:
(i) Basic salary was that paid in respect of the period of the year during which individuals were Directors. Mr Rabin and Mr Wivell were appointed to the Board on 
9 July 2002. Mr Delbridge was appointed to the Board on 24 October 2002. Mr Lester resigned as a Director on 28 June 2002 and was not paid compensation
on leaving the Company. Mr Miles retired as a non-executive Director on 16 May 2002.
(ii) Fees payable to Viscount Weir were not increased during 2002. Mr Stark's fees include E30,000 per annum from Balfour Beatty Rail GmbH for his chairmanship
of the supervisory board of that company, which is based in Munich.
(iii) Benefits in kind are calculated in terms of UK taxable values. For the executive Directors they comprise: a fully expensed car, a fuel card, and private medical
insurance for the Director and his immediate family. The Company also provided Mr Zinkin with a travel allowance and Mr Wivell with limited relocation
assistance to facilitate his move from Edinburgh to London as a result of his appointment as a Director. The benefit in kind shown for Viscount Weir comprises
travel expenses and an accommodation allowance in respect of the time he spends in London on Company business. Part of the benefit in kind paid to Mr Rabin
was in connection with the Company's requirement at short notice for him to rearrange his family's vacation so as to be in the UK for the announcement of the
Group's half yearly results following his appointment as Finance Director.
(iv) Other than as stated in Note (iii), no Director receives any expense allowance. Balfour Beatty plc

Notes:
(i) All options are granted for nil consideration on grant and are in respect of 50p ordinary shares of Balfour Beatty plc.
(ii) Executive options granted before 1996 did not contain performance conditions. 
(iii) Since the beginning of 1996, all executive options have been granted to executive Directors subject to the achievement of performance conditions, based on a
predetermined growth in earnings per share before exceptional items (Eps ).
- For the grant made in April 1996, Eps for the last year of the three year performance period must have grown from the average Eps for the previous three
year period by a total of at least 71 2% plus the increase in the Retail Price Index (RPI ) over the performance period. The performance condition allowed for
retesting if not achieved in any three year period and has been satisfied by reference to the three year performance period ended 31 December 2001.
- For the grants made in November 1999 and April 2000, Eps for the last year of the minimum three year performance period must have grown from their
respective fixed base Eps by a total of at least 21 2% and 3% per annum respectively plus the increase in RPI over the relevant period. The performance
condition allowed for retesting from the fixed base. The performance conditions for these grants have been satisfied by reference to the three year
performance periods ended 31 December 2001 and 31 December 2002 respectively.
(iv) The closing market price of the Company's ordinary shares on 31 December 2002 was 144.5p. During the year the highest and lowest closing market prices
were 281p and 126.25p.
(v) Mr Lester's executive share options and savings-related share options lapsed unexercised on his resignation on 28 June 2002.
(vi) Executive share options granted to Mr Welton and Mr Zinkin in April 1992, exercisable at 305p, lapsed unexercised in April 2002, savings-related share options
granted to Mr Welton and Mr Zinkin in May 1996, exercisable at 267.9p, lapsed unexercised in January 2002 and an option granted to Mr Welton under the
savings-related share option scheme in May 1997, exercisable at 208p, lapsed unexercised in January 2003.
(vii) On 22 April 2002, prior to his appointment as a Director, Mr Rabin exercised an executive share option over 15,000 shares granted on 1 May 1997 at an
exercise price of 231p. The market price on 22 April 2002 was 266p and the gain on exercise was  5,250. 
(viii)On 6 December 2002, Mr Tyler exercised an option over 340 ordinary shares held under the savings-related share option scheme 1991 at an exercise price of
91p. The closing market price on 6 December 2002 was 148.25p and, as a result, a gain of  195 was realised. Mr Tyler has retained these shares. Balfour Beatty plc

Directors' pensions
Executive Directors participate in the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund and the Balfour Beatty Senior Executive Pension Fund, the same pension schemes as other
executives. The schemes provide for a pension at a normal retirement age of 62 and each Director pays an annual contribution equal to 5% of pensionable
salary. The target pension for a Director who can complete 20 or more years' pensionable service at normal retirement age is two-thirds of final pensionable
salary, subject to Inland Revenue limits. Directors have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions, but neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits
are included in the tables below. The salaries of Mr Cohen, Mr Eckersall, Mr Lester, Mr Rabin and Mr Tyler are subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap for
pension purposes and details of the Company's contributions to additional arrangements for them are noted underneath the second table below.
The table below sets out the accrued deferred pension which would be paid annually from the schemes at retirement based on each executive Director's
service to 31 December 2002 as well as the additional pension benefit secured in respect of service during the year.

Notes:
(i) The transfer value of the increase in accrued deferred pension is the present value of the increase in excess of inflation in the deferred pension and associated
benefits during the period calculated on the MFR basis in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11, less Director's contributions.
(ii) Mr Welton's pensionable service includes eight years of transferred-in service from previous employment.
The table below sets out the transfer value at 31 December 2002 of each executive Director's accrued deferred pension at that date as well as the movement in
that transfer value over the period. The transfer values represent the cash equivalent values that would have been payable from the schemes had the Directors
left service on the dates shown, and reflect the age of the Director, his period of membership of the schemes and his pensionable salary.

*or date of appointment if later.
Notes:
(i) The transfer value is the present value of the accrued deferred pension and associated benefits at 31 December 2002, calculated on the MFR basis in
accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11. On the MFR basis, transfer values for members below the age of 50 are assumed to be backed entirely by
equities. Over the age range 50 to 60 the asset backing is assumed to move progressively from equities to bonds. 
(ii) The figure is the difference between the transfer value of the accrued benefits at the start and end of the period, less the Director's contributions during the 
period. During the year ended 31 December 2002, falling equity prices have led to a reduction in transfer values, where these are assumed to be backed by
equities. As a result, the transfer value at 31 December 2002 may be lower than the transfer value at 31 December 2001, even though the accrued deferred
pension has increased. 
The salaries of Mr Cohen, Mr Eckersall, Mr Lester, Mr Rabin and Mr Tyler were subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap for pension purposes, and the
Company has contributed to a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme (FURBS ) for each of them. In 2002, the Company's contribution to Mr Cohen's
plan was  29,048, to Mr Eckersall's  34,876, to Mr Lester's  19,273, to Mr Rabin's  19,568 and to Mr Tyler's  31,788. Benefits under these FURBS are additional
to those set out in the tables above. The contribution to Mr Lester's FURBS ceased on his resignation from the Company.
No past Director of the Company has received or become entitled to receive retirement benefits in excess of his entitlements on the date on which those
benefits first became payable, or 31 March 1997 if later. Balfour Beatty plc

Directors' report continued
Research and development
The Group continues to be committed to investment in research and
development in all its areas of activity. This covers new products and processes
and innovation in areas such as information technology and asset 
management systems.
Balfour Beatty undertakes a range of development initiatives throughout its
businesses which are supported by links with selected universities, including the
Universities of Leeds, Strathclyde and UMIST.
Details of the Group's 2002 research and development expenditure are
given in Note 2b on page 45.
Payment of creditors
In the UK, the Company's policy is to settle the terms of payment with suppliers
when agreeing the terms for each transaction or series of transactions; to seek
to ensure that suppliers are aware of the terms of payment; and to abide by
these terms of payment as and when satisfied that the supplier has provided the
goods or services in accordance with the agreed terms. At 31 December 2002
the year end creditors days of the Company were 9 (2001: 29).
Statement of Directors' responsibilities
The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the
Independent Auditors' report on page 39, is made with a view to distinguishing
for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the Directors and of the
auditors in relation to the financial statements.
The Directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare financial
statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of
the affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year
and of the profit or loss for the financial year. The Directors consider that, in
preparing the financial statements on pages 40 to 62, the Company and the
Group have used appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and
supported by reasonable and prudent judgments and estimates, and that all
accounting standards which they consider to be applicable have been followed.
The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Company and the
Group keep accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any
time the financial position of the Company and the Group and which enable
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 1985.
The Directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Company and the
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Auditors
Deloitte & Touche, who were appointed by the Board from 1 August 2002
following the resignation of Arthur Andersen, have indicated their willingness to
continue as auditors.
Annual General Meeting
Viscount Weir, who chairs the Compensation and Appointments Committee,
Mr C R Reeves, who chairs the Audit Committee and Sir David John, who 
chairs the Business Practices Committee, will be available at the Annual General
Meeting to answer any questions arising from the work of these Committees.
The Board regards the Annual General Meeting as an important occasion on
which to communicate with shareholders, and research into subjects of likely
interest to shareholders is undertaken so that questions can be answered during
the meeting for the benefit of all shareholders present. Shareholders may also
put questions in advance of the Annual General Meeting by writing to the
Company Secretary.
The business to be put to the Annual General Meeting is set out in the
separate circular to shareholders.

Corporate Social Responsibility
Safety, Environment and Social Report For the second year we are publishing 
a separate Safety, Environment and Social Report. Shareholders may obtain a
copy of this by following the procedure on page 07. A copy will be available
to all shareholders attending the Annual General Meeting and to preference
shareholders attending the separate class meeting.
Group policies Our published policies on Health and Safety, the Environment,
Ethics and Human Rights remain unchanged. Both the terms of these policies,
and our practice in these areas, are within the terms of reference of the
Business Practices Committee of the Board. Our progress in the areas of
Health, Safety and the Environment is described in the Safety, Environment
and Social Report. Meetings in connection with our human rights 
policy and practice have been held during the year with a number of 
non-governmental organisations.
Employment As the Group operates across a number of business sectors in
different environments it has a decentralised management structure, with
employment policies designed to suit the needs of individual businesses.
However, each employing company is expected to comply with certain key
principles in its design and practice of employment policy. 
These are:
- To provide an open, challenging and participative environment
- To enable all employees to utilise their talents and skills to the full, through
appropriate encouragement, training and development
- To communicate a full understanding of the objectives and performance of
the Group and the opportunities and challenges facing it.
- To provide pay and other benefits which reflect good local practices and
reward individual and collective performance
- To ensure that all applicants and employees receive equal treatment regardless
of origin, gender, disability, sexual orientation or marital status. 
Individual businesses use a variety of methods to communicate key business
goals and issues to employees and also consult and involve their employees
through local publications, briefing groups, consultative meetings, training
programmes and working groups to assist the process of continuous
improvement in the way they operate and do business. Regular publications
inform employees of major business and technical achievements. Many of 
our UK based businesses have either attained or have committed to attain 
the UK Investors in People standard.
The Pension Liaison Committee continues to provide a forum for employee
member representatives to discuss pension matters with management and 
fund advisers. During 2002, the Trust Board and Company continued to
communicate with Pension Fund members through publications called News
about your Pension  and In Touch . The most notable development in 2002
was the establishment of a new defined contribution section of the Balfour
Beatty Pension Fund for new employees from 1 January 2003. 
Donations
In 2002 the Group contributed approximately  0.04m to charities, mostly in the
UK. The Company is currently formulating a revised charities policy under which
it will direct its support to a small number of selected charities, which will be
reviewed annually. The new policy is likely to cause an increase in charitable
donations by the Group.
In addition the Group has enabled UK employees to donate through the
Give-as-you-Earn scheme to various charities of their choice.
Taxation status
The Company is not a close company for taxation purposes.
Post balance sheet events
There are no post balance sheet events.
