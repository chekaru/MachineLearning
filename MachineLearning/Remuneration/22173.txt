 Activities
The Chairman's statement and Chief Executive's review on pages 16 to 21 
and the Operating review on pages 22 to 29 and the Financial review on 
pages 30 and 31 report on the principal activities of the Group, its operations
during 2003 and future developments in its businesses.
Dividends
The Directors recommend a final dividend on ordinary shares of 3.4p (net) per
share, making, with the interim dividend of 2.6p, a total dividend for 2003 of
6.0p (net). Preference dividends totalling 10.75p (gross) per preference share
have been paid for 2003.
Directors' interests
No Director had any material interest in any contract of significance with the
Group during the period under review. The interests of Directors in the share
capital of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings under the long-term
incentive scheme (the Performance Share Plan 2001), and in respect of options
over such share capital, are set out in the tables in the Remuneration report
beginning on page 37.
Share capital and major shareholders 
Details of the share capital of the Company as at 31 December 2003 are set

ordinary shares were repurchased for cancellation and 11,628,652 preference
shares (representing 7.2% of the preference share capital) were repurchased 
for cancellation for a total consideration of  15,922,253 at an average price 
of 136.9p. 1,794,738 ordinary shares were issued following the exercise of

Corporate governance and the Combined Code
This is our first Annual Report since the publication of the Higgs Review 
and the new Combined Code. As a consequence, this part of the report is
longer than in previous years and has a slightly different format.
Overview 
The Board continues to endorse and apply the principles of good corporate
governance reflected in the Combined Code, as appended to the Listing Rules
of the UK Listing Authority. During the year, the Company complied with the
Combined Code save that, until December 2003, the Company had not
identified a separate senior independent Director.
Our governance in the light of the principles and supporting principles and
provisions of the Combined Code is described in the following paragraphs.
At the date of this report, and unless otherwise explained in the text, the
Company is fully compliant with the provisions of the new Combined Code.
Honorary President
On his retirement from the Board, in May 2003, Viscount Weir was appointed
Honorary Life President of the Company in recognition of his long and
distinguished service as a non-executive Director and latterly Chairman of the
Company.
The Board
The Board currently comprises 13 Directors, of whom seven, including the
Chairman, are non-executive. It operates both formally, through Board and
Board Committee meetings, and informally through regular contact between
Directors as required. Decisions on a list of specific matters, including 
strategy, approval of financial statements, risk management and treasury 
policy, major capital expenditure, acquisitions and disposals are reserved to 
the Board or Board Committees. Matters falling outside the list are delegated 
to management.
Board papers are generally sent out at least three days in advance of 
each Board meeting. These always include a written report from each of the
Chief Executive, Chief Operating Officer, Finance Director, director of Health,
Safety and the Environment and Group Managing Directors of Balfour 
Beatty plc and the Chief Executive Officer of Balfour Beatty Inc. At Board
meetings, oral reports are made on issues arising from the written reports, and
both those and other matters of immediate interest or concern are discussed by
the Board. Apart from the Board meetings that approve the interim and final
results respectively, and the Board meeting prior to the Annual General Meeting
(AGM ), a separate presentation on a topic of interest or concern such as 
the operations and prospects of an existing business, or planning the use of
information technology, is normally made to the Board. Each meeting lasts on
average three to four hours.
Meetings of the Board are normally held in London, but meetings are on
occasions held in other parts of the UK and in Europe to enable Directors to visit
the Group's businesses at the same time.
The Board met on 12 occasions in the course of 2003. A table showing
attendance at these meetings and at meetings of the Audit Committee, the
Compensation and Appointments Committee (now replaced by the Nomination
Committee and the Remuneration Committee, as described on pages 35 and
37 respectively) and the Business Practices Committee, is set out on page 36.
The Chairman of the Board is Sir David John, and the Chief Executive is 
Michael Welton. The senior independent Director, appointed in 2003, is 
Robert Walvis. The Chairman of the Audit Committee is Richard Delbridge, 
of the Nomination Committee, Sir David John, and of the Remuneration
Committee, Robert Walvis. Sir David John also chairs the Business 
Practices Committee.
Chairman
Sir David John became Chairman on the retirement of Viscount Weir on 
15 May 2003. Sir David joined the Board in August 2000. Normally, Sir David
spends two days per week on the business of the Company. He has other
significant commitments as non-executive chairman of The BSI Group and of
Premier Oil plc. The Board considers that his other commitments are not of such
a nature as to hinder his activities as Chairman of the Company and of the
Nomination and Business Practices Committees.
Directors
Details of the Directors, including the Chairman, are given on pages 32 and 33.
All the Directors shown served throughout the year with the exception of
Christoph von Rohr, who was appointed a non-executive Director on 10 June
2003, and Chalmers Carr and Gordon Sage, who were appointed 
non-executive Directors on 1 September 2003. Viscount Weir and Christopher
Reeves resigned as non-executive Directors on 15 May 2003 following the AGM
and Udo Stark resigned as a non-executive Director on 10 June 2003. Malcolm
Eckersall retired from his position as an executive Director on 31 October 2003. 
The Board considers that all the non-executive Directors are independent.
Rotation of Directors, election and re-election 
The Articles of Association of the Company provide that at each AGM one
third, or the nearest number to one third, of the Directors who are subject to
retirement by rotation shall retire from office and shall be eligible for re-election.
This year, 10 Directors are subject to such retirement and three Directors are,
therefore, retiring by rotation. They are Sir David John, Robert Walvis and
Michael Welton. Each is seeking re-election.
The Articles further provide that newly appointed Directors hold office
until the first following AGM, at which each are eligible for, and accordingly
offer themselves for election. The Directors offering themselves for election
under these provisions are Christoph von Rohr, Chalmers Carr and Gordon
Sage. All are non-executive Directors.
Board Committees
The main Board Committees, the membership of which is either wholly or
substantially comprised of non-executive Directors, are the Audit Committee,
the Nomination Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Business
Practices Committee.

Directors' report - The Audit Committee
The membership of this Committee currently comprises Richard Delbridge
(chairman since 15 May 2003 on the retirement of Christopher Reeves),
Chalmers Carr, Christoph von Rohr, Gordon Sage and Sir David Wright, all of
whom are independent non-executive Directors. Christopher Pearson, the
Company Secretary, is the secretary of the Committee.
Sir David John and Robert Walvis (until October 2003), Viscount Weir and
Christopher Reeves (until May 2003) and Udo Stark (until June 2003) were 
all members of the Committee during 2003. Christoph von Rohr joined the
Committee in June 2003 and Chalmers Carr and Gordon Sage joined the
Committee in September 2003. All of the members have extensive experience of
management in large international organisations. Richard Delbridge is a chartered
accountant and a former group finance director of a FTSE 100 company. 
New terms of reference for the Committee, based on the report by
Sir Robert Smith in January 2003 and the requirements of the new
Combined Code on Corporate Governance, were approved by the Board 
in October 2003, and are available on the Company's website, at
www.balfourbeatty.com. The main responsibilities of the Audit Committee
are to monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the Group and any
formal announcements relating to the Group's financial performance; to
review the Group's internal financial controls established to identify, assess,
manage and monitor financial risks and receive reports from management
on the effectiveness of the systems they have established and the
conclusions of any testing carried out by the internal and external auditors;
to monitor and review the effectiveness of the internal audit function; to
make recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment of the
external auditor and to approve the remuneration and terms of engagement
of the external auditor; to assess the independence, objectivity and
effectiveness of the external auditor and to develop and implement policy on
the engagement of the external auditor to supply non-audit services; and to
review arrangements by which staff may, in confidence, raise concerns
about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting.
Appointments to the Committee are made by the Board for a period of up
to three years, extendable by no more than two additional three year periods,
so long as members continue to be independent. Remuneration of members 
of the Committee is set by the Board, excluding independent non-executive
Directors. The Chairman of the Committee provides an oral report on the work
of the Committee and any significant issues that may have arisen, at the Board
meeting following each meeting of the Committee. The minutes of Committee
meetings are circulated to all members of the Board.
In May 2003 it was decided to increase the number of meetings each
year from three to four, and four meetings were held in 2003. At the
invitation of the Committee, partners from the external auditor, the Head of
Internal Audit, the Finance Director and the Chairman regularly attend each
meeting. In addition, any independent non-executive Director who is not a
member has an open invitation to attend meetings.
The Committee met prior to the Board meetings at which the interim
financial statements and the annual report and accounts were approved. 
The Committee reviewed significant accounting policies, financial reporting
issues and judgements and, in conducting this review, considered reports from
the external auditor, financial management and internal audit.
At each of its meetings, the Committee reviewed and considered reports
from the Head of Internal Audit on the status of the Group' s risk management
processes, findings from the internal audit reviews of internal controls and
reports on the status of the correction of any weaknesses in internal controls
identified by the internal or external auditors. The Committee also reviewed
the external auditor' s Group management letters on accounting procedures
and the systems of internal financial control.
During 2003 the Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the external 
audit process, the audit strategy and plans and the qualifications, expertise and
resources of the external auditor. It also reviewed and approved the proposed
audit fee and terms of engagement for the 2003 audit and recommended to
the Board that it propose to shareholders that Deloitte & Touche LLP continue
as the Company's external auditor.
The Committee reviewed the independence procedures of Deloitte 
& T ouche LLP at its meeting in August 2003 and received a letter at the 
March 2004 meeting from them confirming that in their opinion they remained
independent. In June 2003 the Board approved a policy , proposed by the 
Committee, on non-audit work that may be carried out by the external auditor .
The policy is designed to ensure that the independence of the external auditor
will not be compromised by any non-audit work they carry out for the Group by
specifying (a) services from which they are excluded; (b) services for which they
can be engaged without referral to the Committee; and (c) other services for
which a case-by-case decision by the Committee is required. An analysis of 
non-audit fees incurred in 2003 is set out in Note 3c on page 52.
The Committee reviewed and approved the remit, organisation, plans and
resources of the Group's internal audit function and received reports from the
Head of Internal Audit at each of its meetings. The Committee has carried out 
a review of the effectiveness of the internal audit function and met the head of
the function without the presence of management.
- The Nomination Committee
The Committee was established by the Board in November 2003 to take over
certain functions of the Compensation and Appointments Committee (the
CAC ). The terms of reference for the Committee are available on the
Company's website.
The Committee is chaired by Sir David John. Its other members are Gordon
Sage, Robert Walvis, Michael Welton and Sir David Wright. The secretary of the
Committee is Peter Johnson, director of personnel.
Including its activity as the CAC until November 2003, the Committee
met on 11 occasions in 2003. It considered, in particular, the appointments
of the three non-executive Directors appointed during the year. 
Non-executive Directors are chosen on the basis of their individual
background and experience and for the contribution they can make both
generally and in specific areas relevant to the business of the Company. 
Thus, the Chairman, Sir David John, brings the experience of leading large
international companies; Richard Delbridge comes with City and financial
experience at the highest level; Robert Walvis brings the benefit of wide
experience drawn from a career in senior positions at Shell; and Sir David
Wright, as a former head of UK Trade and Investment, comes with his extensive
knowledge of overseas markets, particularly the Far East. 
Candidates are identified by a combination of using both outside
consultants and the wide range of personal contacts at senior level which the
Board members have between them. An independent outlook is an essential
qualification for selection.
Following the resignation of Udo Stark in June 2003, it was agreed by
the Nomination Committee to approach Christoph von Rohr, who was
already known to the Committee as a result of his membership of the
supervisory board of the Company's major German subsidiary, Balfour Beatty
Rail GmbH. He is a well respected and experienced businessman and was 
a logical and obvious candidate to replace Udo Stark, bearing in mind 
the Group's increased involvement in other European markets, 
particularly Germany.
The appointments of Chalmers Carr and Gordon Sage were made
following a search carried out by Egon Zehnder in which a number of
candidates were considered against an agreed specification. Chalmers Carr has
knowledge and experience in international banking and corporate law, and
Gordon Sage, with his background in Rio Tinto, has valuable experience in large
and complex capital projects. Following interview, the Committee duly
recommended to the Board that they each be offered appointment as a
non-executive Director. 
- The Remuneration Committee
Information about the working and membership of this Committee is contained
in the Remuneration report beginning on page 37.
- Business Practices Committee
The Business Practices Committee was established in January 2001. It is chaired
by Sir David John, and has as its other members Chalmers Carr, Christoph von
Rohr, Gordon Sage, Robert Walvis and Sir David Wright. The Secretary is
Christopher Pearson, the Company Secretary. It meets three or four times a year
and its current terms of reference cover matters of business conduct, ethics,
reputation, health, safety and the environment and other matters of corporate
social responsibility. It is also charged with reviewing the effectiveness of the
whistle blowing procedures established in the Group. In placing this
responsibility with the Business Practices Committee, the Company has not
complied with the new Combined Code, which requires the Audit Committee
to carry out this function. The reason for adopting a different approach in this
respect is that the Board believes that, based on experience, the great majority
of whistle blowing complaints are likely to arise out of non-financial matters.
Arrangements whereby concerns may be raised about possible financial
impropriety will, as already stated, continue to be the concern of the 
Audit Committee.
The Committee met on three occasions during 2003. Among 
matters considered by the Committee in 2003 were the implications of 
the Group's Drug and Alcohol policy, corporate social responsibility generally
and issues surrounding the reporting of accident frequency rates and safety
near misses .

Board Committee and Director performance evaluation
At the time of writing this report, no evaluation exercise has been conducted
and we will report on this in 2005. A number of alternative methods are 
being researched.
Dialogue with shareholders
The Company has a long-established programme of regular communication
with institutional investors and brokers. Presentations are made to brokers'
analysts, the press and institutional investors at the time of the announcement
of final and half-year results and there are regular meetings with analysts and
investors throughout the year, which are organised through the Company's
brokers, so that the investment community can be kept informed of longer
term strategic matters and can communicate their views to the Board. 
We expect to continue this programme, within the constraints of relevant
legislation and practice. The Group's website is at www.balfourbeatty.com and
is a regular channel of communication with shareholders and others.
Regular reports are made by executive Directors to the Board on 
meetings and other contact with major shareholders or their representatives.
The Chairman himself on occasion attends meetings with shareholders. 
The non-executive Directors believe that by having direct and ready access to
the Chairman at all times, through the senior independent Director and by
reports given at Board meetings, they are kept fully aware of the views of at
least the larger shareholders and the wider investment community. It is open to
them or any of them to attend or arrange meetings with investors if they wish
to do so.
A number of meetings on the subject of corporate governance will be
held later in 2004 with institutional shareholders. These will be attended by the
Chairman and the senior independent Director. The Board believes that these
meetings will provide a good opportunity to enhance the understanding held
by non-executive Directors of the views of the Company's shareholders.
Risk management
The Board takes ultimate responsibility for the Group's systems of risk
management and internal control and reviews their effectiveness. The Board 
has conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the risk management
processes and internal controls during 2003 and in 2004 up to the date of this
report. The review was based on reports to the Board and the Audit Committee
on the following:
  results of internal audit's reviews of internal financial controls;
  a Group-wide certification that effective internal controls had been
maintained, or, where any significant non-compliance or breakdown had
occurred with or without loss, the status of corrective action; and
  a paper prepared by management on the nature, extent and mitigation of
significant risks and on the systems of internal controls.
The Group's systems and controls are designed to ensure that the Group's
exposure to significant risk is properly managed, but the Board recognises that
any system of internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the
risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. In addition,
not all the material joint ventures in which the Group is involved are treated, for
these purposes, as part of the Group. Where they are not, systems of internal
control are applied as agreed between the parties to the venture.
Central to the Group's systems of internal control are its processes and
framework for risk management. These accord with the Turnbull Guidance
on internal controls and were in place throughout the year and up to the
date of signing this report.
The Group's systems of internal control operate through a number of
different processes, some of which are interlinked. These include:
  the annual review of the strategy and plans of each operating company and
of the Group as a whole in order to identify, inter alia, the risks to the Group's
achievement of its overall objectives and, where appropriate, any relevant
mitigating actions;
  monthly financial reporting against budgets and the review of results and
forecasts by executive Directors and line management, including particular
areas of business or project risk. This is used to update both management's
understanding of the environment in which the Group operates and the
methods used to mitigate and control the risks identified;
  individual tender and project review procedures commencing at operating
company level and progressing to Board Committee level if value or perceived
exposure breaches certain thresholds;
  regular reporting, monitoring and review of health, safety and environmental
matters;
  the review and authorisation of proposed investment, divestment and capital
expenditure through the Board's Committees and the Board itself;
  the review of specific material areas of Group-wide risk and the formulation
and monitoring of risk mitigating actions;
  the formulation and review of properly documented policies and procedures,
updated through the free and regular flow of information to address the
changing risks of the business;
  specific policies set out in the Group Finance Manual, covering the financial
management of the Group, including arrangements with the Group's bankers
and bond providers, controls on foreign exchange dealings and management
of currency and interest rate exposures, insurance, capital expenditure
procedures, application of accounting policies and financial controls;
  a Group-wide risk management framework which is applied to all functions in
the Group, whether operational, financial or support. Under it, the key risks
facing each part of the Group are regularly reviewed and assessed, together
with the steps to avoid or mitigate those risks. The results of those reviews are
placed on risk registers and, where necessary, specific action plans are
developed; and
  reviews and tests by the internal audit team of critical business financial
processes and controls and spot checks in areas of perceived high 
business risk.

Directors' report continued Remuneration report
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee of the Board (RemCo ) was established in
November 2003 to take over certain functions from the former Compensation
and Appointments Committee (CAC ). References in this report to the RemCo
mean the CAC in respect of any time before November 2003. The RemCo is
primarily responsible for determining the remuneration policy and conditions 
of service for the executive Directors and the Chairman of the Company. 
It also reviews and monitors the remuneration policy for senior management
immediately below Board level. The other functions of the CAC, such as making
recommendations to the Board for the appointment of executive Directors, have
been taken over by the Nomination Committee, which was also established in
November 2003. The terms of reference of the RemCo can be found on the
Company's website.
Currently the RemCo is chaired by Robert Walvis and also comprises 
Chalmers Carr, Richard Delbridge, Sir David John and Christoph von Rohr, 
all of whom are independent non-executive Directors. Michael Welton, the
Chief Executive, is invited to join its meetings whenever appropriate, and Peter
Johnson, the director of personnel, attends as secretary. Advice and assistance
has been provided to the RemCo by the Monks Partnership (Monks ), 
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (NBSC ) and Peter Johnson. 
No member of the RemCo has any personal financial interest, other than
as a shareholder, in the matters to be decided by the RemCo, nor potential
conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships, and no member of the
RemCo has any day-to-day involvement in the executive management of 
the Group. No Director has any involvement in discussions relating to his 
own remuneration.
Monks and NBSC were each appointed by the RemCo to provide
independent advice and assistance to it. Monks has also provided data and
advice to the Company regarding the remuneration of senior management
below Board level. 
Executive Directors' remuneration
General policy
The policy of the RemCo is to pay competitive basic salaries to facilitate the
recruitment and retention of high calibre management so as to ensure that the
Company performs to its potential and increases shareholder value.
Annual bonuses and long-term incentive schemes continue to be seen 
as an important part of each Director's total remuneration and are used to 
drive and reward performance. The RemCo aims to ensure that performance
related elements form an important part of the total remuneration package 
and that these are designed to align the Directors' interests with those of
shareholders and to give the Directors challenging incentives to perform at the
highest level. The RemCo has sought to reflect this policy in the current
remuneration packages. 
Executive Directors are invited to participate in the Balfour Beatty 
Pension Fund.
Basic salaries
In setting the basic salaries of executive Directors, the RemCo obtains data 
and independent advice from Monks and NBSC on the remuneration levels in
companies which it considers to be comparable by taking into account the
broad business sectors in which the Company operates, its market capitalisation
and its annual turnover. 
The RemCo used this market data, together with its own judgement of
the performance of the Group's businesses and the contribution made by
individual Directors, in determining basic salary increases implemented on 1 July
2003. The RemCo intends to adopt a similar approach in July 2004 and for the
foreseeable future. The basic salary increases implemented on 1 July 2003
averaged 7.1%.
Annual incentive plan
Each executive Director participates in an annual incentive plan, under which
predetermined financial targets must be achieved before any payment is
earned. The maximum potential bonus which could have been earned by
executive Directors for 2003 was 50% of basic salary and the performance
indicator chosen was profit before tax, exceptional items and goodwill
amortisation. Based on the performance of the Company for the year ended 
31 December 2003, each executive Director earned a bonus of 26.7% of basic
salary. Precise figures are shown in the first table on page 39. These bonuses are
payable in cash, after deduction of tax, and are non pensionable. For 2004 a
similar bonus structure will operate with the maximum potential bonus again
being 50% of basic salary. For subsequent years, the RemCo will continue to
review the competitiveness and structure of the annual incentive plan.
Long-term incentive scheme 
In 2001 the Company obtained shareholder approval for a Performance Share
Plan (Plan ), a long-term incentive scheme which is entirely performance
related. Following agreement by the RemCo, conditional awards were again
made in 2003. Under the Plan, executive Directors and key senior managers
may receive ordinary shares in the Company up to a maximum number
equivalent in market value to their basic salaries at the date of award. 
Details of awards to executive Directors are shown in the table on page 40.
These shares will only vest to the extent that an earnings per share growth
target is met over a three year performance period. The growth in earnings 
per share is determined following independent verification of the calculations
made internally.
For the 2003 award, the extent to which this target is achieved over the
three year period ending 31 December 2005 will determine the number of
shares (if any) to which a Director will be entitled. The maximum award of
shares is made only where the Company's earnings per share before exceptional
items and goodwill amortisation (EPS ) increases by at least 100% in this
period. If EPS growth is 30% over the period, the Directors will be entitled to
30% of the maximum number of shares. If EPS growth is between 30% 
and 100%, the number of shares awarded will be pro rata to actual growth.
No shares can be awarded if EPS growth is less than 30%, and there is no
provision for retesting of the performance condition.
EPS growth was chosen as the performance measure because it was, and
remains, a key objective, since continuing growth in the Company's EPS should
logically be reflected in growth in the share price and dividends and, therefore,
increased returns to shareholders. The importance of EPS growth is well
understood by the Directors and those other senior managers who participate
in the Plan. The RemCo believes that the present management team
contributes directly to achieving EPS growth and is positively motivated by the
Plan. It is, therefore, currently the intention of the RemCo to retain EPS growth
as the performance measure for awards under the Plan for 2004.
The RemCo believes in setting challenging performance targets and, as a
result, in 2001, 2002 and 2003 the maximum award under the Plan was linked
to an EPS growth target of 100%. The RemCo remains committed to
establishing demanding targets for 2004 and for future years but recognises,
however, that if such performance targets are to have a proper incentive effect
they also need to be realistic and achievable. The RemCo therefore intends to
take account of such factors as growth already achieved and future business
prospects so as to ensure a sensible balance in determining the upper target at
which the maximum award is made and the minimum level below which no
award is made.
The performance period for the first conditional awards made in June
2001 was completed on 31 December 2003. The growth in EPS for the period
1 January 2001 to 31 December 2003 exceeded 100% and as a result, 100%
of each participant's conditional award will vest on 7 June 2004. 
The Plan was approved at the 2001 Annual General Meeting for a period
of five years and, unless circumstances change significantly, the RemCo intends
to make further conditional awards under the Plan in 2004 and also anticipates
doing so in 2005. It is intended to submit proposals for future long-term
incentive arrangements to shareholders for approval no later than the 2006
Annual General Meeting.
Executive share options
Prior to the establishment of the Performance Share Plan, grants of options over
ordinary shares were made to executive Directors, some of which remain valid
and unexercised. Details of these appear in the table beginning on page 41. 
It is now the RemCo' s policy that, save in exceptional circumstances, for example
to attract an outstanding individual, further awards of options will not be made
to executive Directors who, in the same year , participate in the Plan. No executive
options have therefore been granted to executive Directors since April 2000 and
it is not intended that any executive options will be granted to executive Directors
in 2004.

Savings-related share option scheme
The Company continues to operate an Inland Revenue approved savings-related
share option scheme (SAYE ) under which employees are granted an option
to purchase shares in the Company in either three or five years time, dependant
upon their entering into a contract to make monthly contributions to a savings
account over the relevant period. These savings are used to fund the option
exercise. The exercise price for the SAYE options granted in 2003 was at a 20%
discount to market value at the date of invitation. This scheme is open to all
employees based in the UK, including executive Directors, and performance
conditions are not applied to the exercise of SAYE options.
Scheme rule amendments
As a result of the passing of the Finance Act 2003, certain minor amendments
to the Executive Share Option Scheme 2001 have been introduced following
approval by the Inland Revenue. No amendments to the Rules of the Savings-
Related Share Option Scheme 2001 or the Performance Share Plan 2001 have
been made. No further amendments to any of these schemes are currently
proposed. All of these three schemes received shareholder approval at the 2001
Annual General Meeting. 
Notice periods
Since 1999, it has been the Company's policy and practice to include in
executive Directors' contracts a 12 month rolling notice period from the
Company and six months' notice on the part of the Director. This policy will
continue in the future. 
All executive Directors have service contracts which provide for notice
periods from the Company of 12 months. Michael Welton and Peter Zinkin
have both voluntarily offered to reduce their notice periods from 24 months to
12 months without any compensation being paid to them. Their service
contracts have therefore been amended, with effect from 1 January 2004, to
reflect this change.
Service contracts of executive Directors do not include provision for specific
payment in the event of early termination, nor do they provide for extended
notice periods in the event of a change of control. It is not the RemCo's
intention to introduce such provisions. If any existing contract of employment is
breached by the Company in the event of termination, the Company would be
liable to pay, as damages, an amount approximating to the net loss of salary
and contractual benefits for the unexpired notice period. The RemCo will seek
to ensure that the Director fulfils his obligation to mitigate his losses and will
also give consideration to phased payments where appropriate.
Details of the service contracts of the executive Directors are shown in the 
table below.

Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors are appointed by the full Board following
recommendations from the Nomination Committee. The Chairman's terms 
of service fall within the remit of the RemCo and the Board determines the
terms on which the services of other non-executive Directors are provided. 
All non-executive Directors are elected for a term of three years unless required
earlier to submit for re-election under the rotational provisions of the Articles of
Association of the Company. They are not eligible to join the Balfour Beatty
Pension Fund and cannot participate in any of the Company's share option,
annual incentive or long-term incentive schemes. None of the appointment
letters for non-executive Directors contain provision for specific payment in the
event of termination for whatever cause. 
The dates of the letters of appointment or last election of the non-executive
Directors are shown in the table below.

The fees of the non-executive Directors are reviewed from time to time, the
last review having been undertaken by the Board in June 2002 when a fee of
 30,000 per annum was agreed, with effect from 1 July 2002. The RemCo
approved fees of  165,000 per annum for Sir David John on his appointment
as non-executive Chairman of the Company on 15 May 2003. The Board
approved an additional fee of  6,000 per annum from 16 May 2003 for
Richard Delbridge for his chairmanship of the Audit Committee, and, from 
1 February 2004, an additional fee of  6,000 per annum for Robert Walvis 
for his chairmanship of the RemCo. No additional fees are currently payable 
to non-executive Directors for chairing any other Board Committees. 
Christoph von Rohr receives a 130,000 per annum fee for his membership 
of the supervisory board of Balfour Beatty Rail GmbH and his chairmanship of
this board since Udo Stark's retirement. Until his retirement in June 2003, Udo
Stark also received a 130,000 per annum fee for his chairmanship of the same
board.
Performance graph
The graph below shows Balfour Beatty's Total Shareholder Return (TSR )
performance compared to the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment
companies) TSR over the five financial years ended 31 December 2003.
The values indicated in the graph show the share price growth plus
reinvested dividends from a  100 hypothetical holding of ordinary shares in
Balfour Beatty plc and in the index at the start of the period and have been
calculated using 30 trading day average values.
The RemCo has elected to compare the TSR on the Company's ordinary
shares against the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment companies) principally
because this is a broad index of which the Company is a constituent member.

Notes:
(i) Basic salary and fees were those paid in respect of the period of the year during which individuals were Directors. Christoph von Rohr was appointed to the
Board on 10 June 2003 and Chalmers Carr and Gordon Sage on 1 September 2003. Viscount Weir and Christopher Reeves resigned as Directors on
15 May 2003 and Udo Stark on 10 June 2003 with no compensation paid on their leaving the Company. Malcolm Eckersall left the Company on 31 October
2003 (see Note v).
(ii) Christoph von Rohr receives a 130,000 per annum fee for his membership of the supervisory board of Balfour Beatty Rail GmbH and his chairmanship of 
this board since Udo Stark's retirement. Until his retirement in June 2003, Udo Stark also received a fee of 130,000 per annum for his chairmanship of the
same board. 
(iii) Benefits in kind are calculated in terms of UK taxable values. For the executive Directors they comprise: a fully expensed car, a fuel card, and private medical
insurance for the Director and his immediate family. The benefit in kind shown for Viscount Weir comprised travel expenses and an accommodation allowance
in respect of the time he spent in London on Company business.
(iv) Other than as stated in Note (iii), no Director receives any expense allowance. 
(v) Under the terms on which he left the Company, Malcolm Eckersall was paid  300,000 as compensation for loss of office. The Company will continue to
provide Malcolm Eckersall with a fully expensed car, a fuel card, and private medical insurance until the earlier of 31 October 2004 or the date on which he
commences alternative employment. These benefits could have a P11D value of  22,724 in total if Malcolm Eckersall does not obtain alternative employment
before 31 October 2004. Of this amount  3,787 is shown above, representing the period 1 November 2003 to 31 December 2003. A further  40,000 will be
payable 28 days after 30 September 2004, which will be reduced by any employment, consultancy or equivalent income or remuneration or benefits received
by Malcolm Eckersall, or promised to him, in relation to the period 1 August 2004 to 30 September 2004. Malcolm Eckersall's annual bonus for 2003 has
been pro rated with respect to the period of his employment.

Notes:
(i) All awards are granted for nil consideration and are in respect of 50p ordinary shares of Balfour Beatty plc.
(ii) For the awards in June 2001, April 2002 and April 2003, the performance periods are the three years ending 31 December 2003, 31 December 2004 and 
31 December 2005 respectively. The maximum number of shares shown in the table above will be transferred to the Directors only if, and to the extent that,
earnings per share before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation (EPS ) grows by 100% over the performance period. If EPS growth is 30%, the
Directors will be entitled to 30% of the maximum number of shares. If EPS growth is between 30% and 100%, the number of shares awarded will be 
pro rata. No shares can be awarded if EPS growth is less than 30%, and there is no provision for retesting.
(iii) The performance period for the awards made in June 2001 was completed on 31 December 2003. The growth in EPS for this period exceeded 100% and as
a result, 100% of each participant's conditional award will vest on 7 June 2004. 
(iv) The awards made to Malcolm Eckersall in 2002 and 2003 lapsed on his leaving the Company on 31 October 2003. In respect of the award made to him on 
7 June 2001, upon the recommendation of the RemCo, the Trustees of the Plan exercised their discretion and allowed 78,000 shares to vest, having regard to
the underlying financial performance of the Company since the beginning of the performance period which commenced on 1 January 2001. This award was
exercised on 19 November 2003, when the closing market price of the shares was 200.25p. 
(v) The average middle market price of ordinary shares in the Company for the three dealing days before the date of the 2001 award under the Plan, which was
used for calculating the number of awards granted, was 199.333p, for the 2002 award was 237.583p and for the 2003 award was 172.66p. The closing
market price of ordinary shares on the date of the awards was 202.5p, 251p and 170.5p respectively. Balfour Beatty plc

Directors' pensions
Executive Directors participate in the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund. The scheme provides for a pension at a normal retirement age of 62 and each Director pays an
annual contribution equal to 5% of pensionable salary. The pension for a Director who can complete 20 or more years' pensionable service at normal retirement
age is targeted at two-thirds of final pensionable salary, subject to Inland Revenue limits. Directors have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions, but
neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the tables below. The salaries of Jim Cohen, Malcolm Eckersall, Anthony Rabin and Ian Tyler
were subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap for pension purposes and details of the Company's contributions to additional arrangements for them are noted
underneath the table on page 43.
The table below sets out the accrued deferred pension which would be paid annually from the scheme at retirement based on each executive Director's
service to 31 December 2003 as well as the additional pension benefit secured in respect of service during the year.

Notes:
(i) Michael Welton's pensionable service includes eight years of transferred-in service from previous employment.
(ii) The transfer value of the increase in accrued deferred pension is the present value of the increase in excess of inflation in the deferred pension and associated
benefits during the period, less the Director's contributions, calculated using the Fund specific transfer basis in force at 31 December 2003 and on the basis of
actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
(iii) Malcolm Eckersall left the Company on 31 October 2003. The reduction in deferred pension shown reflects Malcolm Eckersall's retained benefits being taken
fully into account. After leaving the Company, Malcolm Eckersall decided to take an immediate pension which amounted to  5,521 per annum.

Notes:
(i) The transfer value is the present value of the accrued deferred pension and associated benefits calculated on the MFR basis in accordance with Actuarial
Guidance Note GN11.
(ii) During 2003, the Trustee of the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund reviewed its transfer basis in common with many other pension schemes and as a result adopted
a Fund specific basis towards the end of 2003. In the majority of cases this revised transfer basis would result in a higher transfer value than that calculated
under the MFR basis. The transfer values shown represent the transfer value of the accrued deferred pension and associated benefits as at 31 December 2002,
but calculated using this Fund specific transfer basis.
(iii) The figure is the difference between the transfer value of the accrued benefits at the start and end of the period, less the Director's contributions during the
period. The transfer value at the start of the period used is that calculated on the revised transfer basis, referred to in Note (ii) above, in order to eliminate
distortion caused by the change in calculation basis.
(iv) The transfer value is the present value of the accrued deferred pension and associated benefits at 31 December 2003, calculated using the transfer basis then
in force and on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11. Malcolm Eckersall left the Company on 31 October 2003 and
decided to take an immediate pension of  5,521 per annum, so the figure quoted in the above table is the actuarial value of his immediate pension.
The salaries of Jim Cohen, Malcolm Eckersall, Anthony Rabin and Ian Tyler were subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap for pension purposes, and the
Company has contributed to a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme (FURBS ) for each of them. In 2003, the Company's contribution to Jim Cohen's
plan was  30,764, to Malcolm Eckersall's  30,449, to Anthony Rabin's  41,541 and to Ian Tyler's  36,051. Benefits under these FURBS are additional to those set
out in the tables above. The contribution to Malcolm Eckersall's FURBS ceased on his leaving the Company on 31 October 2003. 
No past Director of the Company has received or become entitled to receive retirement benefits in excess of his entitlements on the date on which those
benefits first became payable, or 31 March 1997 if later.

43 Corporate Social Responsibility
Safety, Environment and Social Report 
For the third year we are publishing a separate Safety, Environment and Social
Report. Shareholders may obtain a copy of this by following the procedure on
page 21. A copy will be available to all shareholders attending the Annual
General Meeting and to preference shareholders attending the separate 
class meeting.
Group policies 
Our published policies on Health & Safety, the Environment, Ethics and Human
Rights have been updated since last year but remain essentially unchanged. Our
progress in the areas of Health & Safety and the Environment is described in the
Safety, Environment and Social Report. During the year our human rights policy
and practices in our overseas businesses have been independently reviewed.
Employment 
As the Group operates across a number of business sectors in different
environments it has a decentralised management structure, with employment
policies designed to suit the needs of individual businesses. However, each
employing company is expected to comply with certain key principles in its
design and practice of employment policy. 
These are:
  to provide an open, challenging and participative environment;
  to enable all employees to utilise their talents and skills to the full, through
appropriate encouragement, training and development;
  to communicate a full understanding of the objectives and performance of
the Group and the opportunities and challenges facing it;
  to provide pay and other benefits which reflect good local practices and
reward individual and collective performance; and
  to ensure that all applicants and employees receive equal treatment regardless
of origin, gender, disability, sexual orientation, marital status, religion or belief.
Individual businesses use a variety of methods to communicate key business
goals and issues to employees and also consult and involve their employees
through local publications, briefing groups, consultative meetings, training
programmes and working groups to assist the process of continuous
improvement in the way they operate and do business. Regular publications
inform employees of major business and technical achievements. Many of 
our UK based businesses have either attained or have committed to attain 
the UK Investors in People standard.
The Pension Liaison Committee continues to provide a forum for
employee member representatives to discuss pension matters with
management and fund advisers. 
Donations
In 2003 the Group contributed approximately  0.03m to charities. It has also
provided material assistance in kind to the charitable organisation Engineers
Against Poverty, which carries out small engineering projects in developing
countries. The Company is now in the final stages of formulating a revised
charities policy under which it will direct its support to a small number of
selected charities, which will be reviewed annually. The new policy is likely to
cause an increase in charitable donations by the Group.
In addition the Group has enabled UK employees to donate through
the Give-as-you-Earn scheme to various charities of their choice.
Taxation status
The Company is not a close company for taxation purposes.
Post balance sheet events
Details of post balance sheet events are set out in Note 26 on page 69.
Research and development
The Group continues to be committed to investment in research and
development in all its areas of activity. This covers new products and processes
and innovation in areas such as information technology and asset 
management systems.
We continue to undertake a range of development initiatives throughout
our businesses which are supported by links with selected universities.
Details of the Group's 2003 research and development expenditure are
given in Note 3b on page 52.
Payment of creditors
In the UK, the Company's policy is to settle the terms of payment with suppliers
when agreeing the terms for each transaction or series of transactions; to seek
to ensure that suppliers are aware of the terms of payment; and to abide by
these terms of payment as and when satisfied that the supplier has provided
the goods or services in accordance with the agreed terms. At 31 December
2003 the year end creditors' days of the Company were 27 (2002: 9).
Statement of Directors' responsibilities
The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the
Independent auditors' report on page 45, is made with a view to distinguishing
for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the Directors and of the
auditors in relation to the financial statements.
The Directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare financial
statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year and of
the profit or loss of the Group for the financial year. The Directors consider that,
in preparing the financial statements on pages 46 to 71, the Company and the
Group have used appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and
supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, and that all
applicable accounting standards have been followed.
The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Company and the
Group keep accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any
time the financial position of the Company and the Group and which enable
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 1985.
The Directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Company and the
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Auditors
On 1 August 2003, Deloitte & Touche transferred their business to Deloitte &
Touche LLP , a limited liability partnership incorporated under the Limited Liability
Partnerships Act 2000. The Company's consent has been given to treating the
appointment of Deloitte & Touche as extending to Deloitte & Touche LLP with
effect from 1 August 2003 under the provisions of Section 26(5) of the
Companies Act 1989. Deloitte & Touche LLP have indicated their willingness 
to continue as auditors.
Annual General Meeting
Sir David John, who chairs the Nomination and Business Practices Committees,
Richard Delbridge, who chairs the Audit Committee and Robert Walvis, who
chairs the Remuneration Committee, will be available at the Annual General
Meeting to answer any questions arising from the work of these Committees.
The Board regards the Annual General Meeting as an important occasion on
which to communicate with shareholders, and research into subjects of likely
interest to shareholders is undertaken so that questions can be answered during
the meeting for the benefit of all shareholders present. Shareholders may also
put questions in advance of the Annual General Meeting by writing to the
Company Secretary.
The business to be put to the Annual General Meeting is set out in the
separate circular to shareholders.
