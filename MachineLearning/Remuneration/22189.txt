 Remuneration report 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee of the Board (RemCo ) is primarily responsible for 
determining the remuneration policy and conditions of service for the executive 
Directors and Chairman of the Company . It also reviews and monitors the level 
and structure of remuneration for senior management immediately below the 
level of the Board. The terms of reference of the RemCo can be found on the 
Company' s website and are available on request from the Company Secretary . 
The RemCo is chaired by Robert Walvis. Its other members are Chalmers 
Carr, Richard Delbridge and Christoph von Rohr, all of whom are independent 
non executive Directors. Sir David John was a member of the RemCo until 
1 February 2005 when he resigned from this committee. In future he will 
attend by invitation, when appropriate. No member of the RemCo has any 
personal financial interest, other than as a shareholder, in the matters to 
be decided by the RemCo, nor potential conflicts of interest arising from 
cross directorships, and no member of the RemCo has any day to day 
involvement in the executive management of the Group. 
During 2004 the Chief Executive, Michael Welton, was invited to join 
meetings of the RemCo whenever appropriate, and the practice of inviting 
the Chief Executive to join meetings has continued with Ian Tyler as Chief 
Executive. Peter Johnson, the director of personnel, continues to act as secretary 
of the RemCo. No Director has any involvement in discussions relating to his 
own remuneration. 
Advice and assistance have been provided to the RemCo throughout the 
year by the Monks Partnership (Monks ), New Bridge Street Consultants LLP 
(NBSC ) and Peter Johnson. 
Monks and NBSC were each appointed by the RemCo to provide 
independent advice and assistance to it, and their terms of reference are 
available on the Company's website and on request from the Company 
Secretary. Monks has also provided data and advice to the Company regarding 
the remuneration of senior management below Board level. 
Executive Directors' remuneration 
General policy 
It is the policy of the RemCo to provide an overall remuneration package 
that is competitive and fair to senior management and which facilitates the 
recruitment and retention of high calibre management. The annual and 
long term incentive plans make up an important part of each executive 
Directors' remuneration and are structured so as to motivate senior managers 
to deliver high standards of performance, without encouraging excessive 
risk taking. It is intended that the share based elements of the package will 
not only drive performance over the long term but will also assist in aligning 
the interests of management with those of shareholders. 
During the course of 2004, the RemCo has carried out a review of the 
existing remuneration package and, as a result, believes that certain changes 
could be made which will make the package more effective in supporting the 
RemCo's remuneration policy. Although not requiring shareholder approval, 
these changes have been discussed with our major shareholders and are 
described in the relevant sections below. They will be implemented in 2005 and 
will continue in 2006, subject to review. If target performance is achieved, basic 
salary will represent around one half of total earnings. If maximum is achieved, 
which would involve a superior level of performance substantially in excess of 
business plan, basic salary will represent around one third of total earnings. 
Executive Directors can join the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund. The RemCo 
is actively considering the policy it will adopt regarding pension provision after 
April 2006 in the light of the government's changes to pension taxation. 
Basic salaries 
It is the policy of the RemCo to set basic salaries at levels which it believes are 
competitive given the size and complexity of the Company, as well as the broad 
business sectors in which it operates. To assist in this, Monks and NBSC provide 
data and independent advice on remuneration levels in companies considered 
to be comparable in terms of annual sales, market capitalisation and industry 
sector. The RemCo does not specifically aim to set basic salaries at a stated 
point relative to the market, rather it uses this data in conjunction with its own 
judgement of the performance of the Group's businesses and the performance 
of individual Directors when setting basic salaries. The RemCo intends to 
continue to use this approach in the foreseeable future. 
The basic salaries of executive Directors are reviewed annually at 1 July 
and the basic salaries following the review at 1 July 2004 are shown in the 
table below. The average increase was 6.5%.

The RemCo subsequently agreed a basic salary of  440,000 for Ian Tyler 
which took effect on his appointment as Chief Executive on 1 January 2005. 
Annual incentive plan 
Each executive Director participates in an annual incentive plan, under which 
predetermined financial targets must be achieved before any payment is earned. 
The maximum potential bonus which could have been earned by executive 
Directors for 2004 was 50% of basic salary and the performance indicator 
chosen was profit before tax, exceptional items and goodwill amortisation 
(profit ). A bonus of 25% of basic salary would have been earned for the 
achievement of performance in line with target. The actual profit for the year 
ended 31 December 2004 resulted in a bonus of 32.6% of basic salary for each 
executive Director . Precise figures are shown in the first table on page 46. These 
bonuses are payable in cash, after deduction of tax, and are non pensionable. 
For 2005 a revised annual incentive plan will operate. Under the revised 
plan, the maximum potential bonus available to executive Directors and 
key senior managers will be 80% of basic salary. However, one third of any 
bonus earned will be deferred in the form of ordinary shares in the Company, 
which will be released after three years, providing the individual is still in 
the Company's employment at that time. The remaining two thirds of any 
bonus payment will be made immediately in cash after the deduction of tax. 
The RemCo has decided to increase the maximum potential bonus 
because it believes that it is essential to have in place a competitive annual 
incentive which drives short term performance and also ensures that the 
Company continues to attract and retain executive Directors and key senior 
managers who can deliver sustainable earnings growth in the future. 
In designing the new structure, the RemCo also wanted to improve the 
link between annual and long term performance and further strengthen 
the alignment of the interests of management with those of shareholders. 
For this reason there will now be a significant element of bonus deferral in the 
form of shares. Payment under the annual incentive plan will continue to occur 
only on the achievement of predetermined financial targets and payments 
will be non pensionable. In future, the RemCo will continue to review the 
competitiveness and structure of the annual incentive plan. 
Long term incentive scheme 
In 2001 the Company obtained shareholder approval for a Performance Share 
Plan (Plan ), a long term incentive scheme which is entirely performance 
related. Under the Plan, executive Directors and key senior managers may 
receive ordinary shares in the Company up to a maximum number equivalent 
in market value to their basic salaries at the date of award. Details of awards to 
executive Directors are shown in the table on page 47. These shares will only 
vest to the extent that an earnings per share growth target is met over a three 
year performance period. The growth in earnings per share is determined 
following independent verification of the calculations made internally. 
Growth in earnings per share before exceptional items, goodwill 
amortisation and appropriations arising on the buy back of preference shares 
(EPS ) was chosen as the performance measure because it was, and remains, 
a key objective, since continuing growth in the Company's EPS should logically 
be reflected in growth in the share price and dividends and, therefore, 
increased returns to shareholders. The Directors and those other senior 
managers who participate in the Plan are positively motivated by it and fully 
understand the importance of EPS growth. The RemCo is aware of the impact 
of the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS ) 
on EPS and is considering how it will ensure consistency when assessing the 
achievement of performance targets for awards which have already been 
made, where performance periods span the introduction of IFRS. 
The performance period for the conditional awards made in April 2002 was 
completed on 31 December 2004. The performance target for this award was 
such that the maximum number of shares would only vest if growth in EPS over 
the three year performance period was 100% or more. No shares would vest if 
EPS growth was below 30%. At a level of EPS growth of 30%, the minimum 
vesting of 30% of the maximum number of shares would occur , with levels of 
vesting pro rata to actual EPS growth between 30% and 100%. The growth in 
EPS for the period 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2004 was 65.96% and as a 
result, 65.96% of each participant' s conditional award will vest on 17 April 2005. 
Conditional awards were again approved by the RemCo and made under 
the Plan in 2004. In previous years the maximum award under the Plan was 
linked to an EPS growth target of 100%. In establishing performance targets 
for 2004, the RemCo considered the earnings growth achieved in recent years, 
future business prospects, and the requirement that targets going forward 
should continue to be demanding but also achievable. The RemCo concluded 
that to continue to link the minimum and maximum levels of vesting to EPS 
growth targets of 30% and 100% would not be effective in incentivising the 
participants to perform to the high standards required and that shareholders 
expect. As a result, the maximum award of shares in respect of the 2004 
award will only vest if growth in the Company's EPS is at least 70% over the 
three year period ending 31 December 2006. If EPS growth is 25% over the 
period, participants will be entitled to 30% of the maximum award of shares. 
If EPS growth is between 25% and 70%, the number of shares vesting will  be pro rata to actual growth. No shares will vest if EPS growth is less than 
25% and there is no provision for retesting the performance condition. 
The RemCo believes that the range of EPS targets established in 2004 remains 
amongst the most challenging in the sector and the market generally. 
Unless circumstances change significantly, the RemCo intends to make 
further conditional awards under the Plan in 2005 and will again set similarly 
demanding targets which are consistent with the objectives of the Company 
and will motivate the participants to achieve earnings growth. 
The Plan was approved at the 2001 Annual General Meeting for a period 
of five years and it is intended to submit proposals for future long term 
incentive arrangements to shareholders for approval no later than the 2006 
Annual General Meeting. 
Share ownership guidelines 
To further align the interests of senior management with those of shareholders, 
the RemCo has introduced share ownership guidelines which will apply to all 
participants in the Plan. Executive Directors will be required to build up a 
holding in shares of the Company to the value of one times basic salary. 
In order to achieve this, they will be expected to retain at least half of the 
shares (after payment of any taxes due) which vest from future awards 
made under the Plan and from the revised annual incentive plan. 
Executive share options 
Since the introduction of the Plan in 2001, it has been the RemCo's policy only 
to make grants of executive share options to participants in the Plan in 
exceptional circumstances, for example, to recruit a high calibre individual. 
Grants of options over ordinary shares were made to executive Directors before 
this time, some of which remain valid and unexercised and are detailed in the 
table on page 48. Certain managers below the level of those participating in 
the Plan have been granted options under the Executive Share Option Scheme 
2001. In future, selected managers will participate in an annual incentive plan 
with a deferred share element similar to that described above, but with lower 
levels of maximum bonus. It is intended that no further grants of executive 
share options will be made to any level of management, except when it is 
necessary to facilitate the recruitment of an outstanding individual. 
Savings related share option scheme 
The Company continues to operate an Inland Revenue approved savings 
related share option scheme (SAYE ) under which employees are granted an 
option to purchase shares in the Company in either three or five years time, 
dependent upon their entering into a contract to make monthly contributions 
to a savings account over the relevant period. These savings are used to fund 
the option exercise. The exercise price for the SAYE options granted in 2004 
was at a 20% discount to market value at the date of invitation. This scheme is 
open to all employees based in the UK, including executive Directors, and 
performance conditions are not applied to the exercise of SAYE options. 
Executive Directors: Notice periods 
Since 1999, it has been the Company's policy and practice to include in 
executive Directors' contracts a 12 month rolling notice period from the 
Company and six months' notice on the part of the Director. This policy will 
continue in the future. 
Details of the service contracts of the executive Directors are shown in the 
table below.

*Retired from the Company on 31 December 2004 
Service contracts of executive Directors do not include provision for specific 
payment in the event of early termination, nor do they provide for extended 
notice periods in the event of a change of control. It is not the RemCo's 
intention to introduce such provisions. If any existing contract of employment is 
breached by the Company in the event of termination, the Company would be 
liable to pay, as damages, an amount approximating to the net loss of salary 
and contractual benefits for the unexpired notice period. The RemCo will seek 
to ensure that the Director fulfils his obligation to mitigate his losses and will 
also give consideration to phased payments where appropriate. 
External appointments 
The RemCo recognises that benefits can arise from allowing executive Directors 
to take a non executive role elsewhere. W ith approval of the Boar d in each 
case, executive Directors may ther efore accept one external appointment and 
retain any related fees. Jim Cohen was appointed as a non executive Dir ector 
of of fice2office plc on 29 June 2004 and fees of  16,500 wer e paid to him for 
his services during the year ended 31 December 2004.

Non executive Directors 
Non executive Directors are appointed by the full Board following 
recommendations from the Nomination Committee. The Chairman's terms 
of service fall within the remit of the RemCo and the Board determines the 
terms on which the services of other non executive Directors are provided. 
All non executive Directors are elected for a term of three years unless required 
earlier to submit for re election under the rotational provisions of the Articles 
of Association of the Company. They are not eligible to join the Balfour Beatty 
Pension Fund and cannot participate in any of the Company's share option, 
annual incentive or long term incentive schemes. None of the appointment 
letters for non executive Directors contain provision for specific payment in the 
event of termination for whatever cause. 
The dates of the letters of appointment or last election of the non 
executive Directors are shown in the table below.

During the year, the executive Directors agreed that, in view of the increasing 
demands placed on the non executive Directors, the basic annual fees payable 
to them (excluding the Chairman) should be increased by  3,000 to  33,000 
with effect from 1 July 2004. 
At the same time the RemCo agreed that the annual fees payable to 
the Chairman should be increased by  8,000 to  173,000 with ef fect 
from 1 July 2004. The Chairman was not in attendance when this matter 
was discussed. 
Additional fees of  6,000 per annum ar e payable to Robert Walvis and 
Richard Delbridge for their chairmanship of the RemCo and Audit Committees 
respectively, and a fee of  a30,000 per annum is payable to Christoph von Rohr 
for his chairmanship of the supervisory boar d of Balfour Beatty Rail GmbH. 
Performance graph 
The graph below shows Balfour Beatty's Total Shareholder Return (TSR ) 
performance compared to the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment 
companies) TSR over the five financial years ended 31 December 2004. 
The values indicated in the graph show the share price growth plus 
reinvested dividends from a  100 hypothetical holding of ordinary shares in 
Balfour Beatty plc and in the index at the start of the period and have been 
calculated using 30 trading day average values. 
The RemCo has elected to compar e the TSR on the Company's ordinary 
shares against the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment companies) principally 
because this is a broad index of which the Company is a constituent member .

Notes: 
(i) All awards ar e granted for nil consideration and ar e in respect of 50p ordinary shares of Balfour Beatty plc. 
(ii)	 For the awards made in April 2004, the performance period is the three years ending 31 December 2006. The maximum number of shares shown in the 
table above will vest only if earnings per shar e before exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and appropriations arising on the buy back of pr eference 
shares (EPS ) grows by at least 70% over the performance period. If EPS growth is 25%, the Directors will be entitled to 30% of the maximum award of 
shares. If EPS growth is between 25% and 70%, the number of shares vesting will be pr o rata to actual growth. No shares will vest if EPS growth is less 
than 25%, and ther e is no provision for r etesting. 
(iii) For the awards made in April 2002 and April 2003, the performance periods ar e the three years ending 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2005 
respectively. The maximum awar d of shares shown in the table above will vest only if EPS grows by at least 100% over the performance period. If EPS growth 
is 30%, the Directors will be entitled to 30% of the maximum awar d of shares. If EPS growth is between 30% and 100%, the number of shares vesting will 
be pr o rata to actual growth. No shares will vest if EPS growth is less than 30%, and ther e is no provision for retesting. 
(iv) The performance period for the awards made in April 2002 was completed on 31 December 2004. The growth in EPS for this period was 65.96% and as a 
result, 65.96% of each participant's conditional award will vest on 17 April 2005. 
(v) The performance period for the awards made in June 2001 was completed on 31 December 2003. The growth in EPS for this period exceeded 100% and as 
a result, 100% of each participant's conditional award vested on 7 June 2004. The closing middle market price of ordinary shares on the vesting date was 
250.25p. 
(vi) The awards made to Michael Welton in 2003 and 2004 lapsed on his retirement from the Company on 31 December 2004. However, since he had been 
employed by the Company for the entirety of the performance period for the 2002 award, the RemCo decided it was appropriate to exercise its discretion in 
his favour and allow him to retain this award on his retirement from the Company, exercisable at the same time and in the same proportion as the awards of

*The value realisable from shares acquired on exercise is the difference between the closing market price on the date exercised and the exercise price of the 
options, although the shares may have been retained, in which case they are included in the table on page 46, headed Directors' interests . 
Directors' pensions 
Executive Directors participate in the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund. The scheme provides for a pension at a normal retirement age of 62 and each Director pays an 
annual contribution equal to 5% of pensionable salary . The pension for a Director who can complete 20 or more years' pensionable service at normal retirement 
age is targeted at two thirds of final pensionable salary, subject to Inland Revenue limits. Directors have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions, but 
neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the tables below. The salaries of Jim Cohen, Anthony Rabin and Ian Tyler were subject to the 
Inland Revenue earnings cap for pension purposes and details of the Company's contributions to additional arrangements for them are noted underneath the 
table on page 50. 
The table below sets out the accrued deferred pension which would be paid annually from the scheme at normal retirement age based on each executive 
Director's service to 31 December 2004 as well as the additional pension benefit secured in respect of service during the year.

Notes: 
(i) Michael Welton's pensionable service includes eight years of transferred in service from previous employment. 
(ii)	 The transfer value of the increase in accrued deferred pension is the present value of the increase in excess of inflation in the deferred pension and associated 
benefits during the period, less the Director's contributions, calculated using the transfer basis in force at 31 December 2004 and on the basis of actuarial 
advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11. For Michael Welton, the transfer value includes the value of his transferred in pension benefits 
from a previous employer.  Balfour Beatty plc

The table below sets out the transfer value at 31 December 2004 of each executive Director's accrued deferred pension at that date as well as the movement in 
that transfer value over the period. The transfer values represent the cash equivalent values that would have been payable from the scheme had the Directors left 
service on the dates shown, and reflect the age of the Director, his period of membership of the scheme and his pensionable salary.

Notes: 
(i)	 The transfer value is the present value of the accrued deferred pension and associated benefits at the relevant date, calculated using the transfer basis then in 
force and on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11. 
(ii) The figure is the difference between the transfer value of the accrued benefits at the start and end of the period, less the Director's contributions during 
the period. 
(iii) Michael Welton retired on 31 December 2004 and took immediate pension benefits. The transfer value at 31 December 2004 is the actuarial value of these 
benefits. The increase in transfer value is due to a combination of factors including an additional year of service, a salary increase from 1 July 2004, the effect 
of him taking early retirement, one year's ageing and changes in investment conditions. The benefit entitlements he accrued as a member of the Balfour 
Beatty Pension Fund were calculated with reference to his basic salary and in accordance with the Rules of this Fund. No augmentation to these benefits has 
been granted. As reported in Note (i) to the second table on page 49, Michael Welton had eight years of transferred in service from a previous employer. 
On retirement, the Trustee was able to grant these transferred in benefits from the Fund at their fair value, within Inland Revenue limits, and the transfer 
value shown at 31 December 2004 fully takes account of this. 
The salaries of Jim Cohen, Anthony Rabin and Ian Tyler were subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap for pension purposes, and the Company has contributed 
to a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme (FURBS ) for each of them. In 2004, the Company's contribution to Jim Cohen's plan was  32,346, to 
Anthony Rabin's  50,531 and to Ian Tyler's  38,209. Benefits under these FURBS are additional to those set out in the tables above. 
No past Director of the Company has received or become entitled to receive retirement benefits in excess of his entitlements on the date on which those 
benefits first became payable, or 31 March 1997 if later.
