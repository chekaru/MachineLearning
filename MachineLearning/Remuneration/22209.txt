 Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee of the Board (RemCo ) is primarily responsible 
for determining the remuneration policy and conditions of service for executive
Directors and the Chairman of the Company. It also reviews and monitors the level
and structure of remuneration for senior management immediately below the level
of the Board. The terms of reference of the RemCo can be found on the Company's
website and are available on request from the Company Secretary.
The RemCo consists entirely of independent non-executive Directors and 
has been chaired by Robert Walvis since November 2003. Its other members are
Chalmers Carr, Steven Marshall (from his appointment on 1 November 2005) and
Christoph von Rohr. Sir David John and Richard Delbridge were members of the
RemCo until 1 February 2005 and 31 December 2005 respectively when they
resigned from this Committee. Since resignation, Sir David John has attended by
invitation. No member of the RemCo has any personal financial interest, other than
as a shareholder, in the matters to be decided by the RemCo, nor potential conflicts
of interest arising from cross-directorships, and no member of the RemCo has any
day-to-day involvement in the executive management of the Group.
During 2005 the Chief Executive, Ian Tyler, was invited to join meetings of 
the RemCo when appropriate. Paul Raby, the human resources director, has acted
as secretary of the RemCo since his appointment on 1 July 2005. Prior to this, 
Peter Johnson, the director of personnel, was secretary of the RemCo. 
No Director has any involvement in discussions relating to his own remuneration.
The RemCo is responsible for appointing external independent consultants to
advise on executive remuneration matters. This advice and assistance has been
provided to the RemCo throughout the year by the Monks Partnership (Monks ),
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (NBSC ), and the human resources director.
The terms of reference of the independent consultants are available on the
Company' s website and on request from the Company Secretary. Monks also
provided data and advice to the Company regarding the remuneration of senior
management below Board level during the year. The RemCo is satisfied that no
conflict of interest arises from the provision of this advice to the Company.
Executive Directors' remuneration
General policy
It is the policy of the RemCo to provide an overall remuneration package that is
competitive and which facilitates the recruitment and retention of high calibre
management. The annual and long-term incentive plans make up an important part
of each executive Director's remuneration and are structured so as to motivate
senior managers to deliver high standards of performance, without encouraging
excessive risk taking. It is intended that the share-based elements of the package
will not only drive performance over the long-term but will also assist in aligning
the interests of management with those of shareholders.
During the course of 2005, the RemCo, assisted by NBSC, has reviewed 
the long-term incentive arrangements in place at the Company, as the existing
Performance Share Plan (PSP ), approved by shareholders in 2001, expires in
2006. As a result of this review, a replacement long-term incentive arrangement 
is being proposed and this is described in the relevant section below. Under the
proposed arrangement, if target performance is achieved, basic salary will
represent around one half of total earnings. If maximum is achieved, which would
involve a superior level of performance substantially in excess of business plan,
basic salary will represent around one third of total earnings.
Executive Directors can join the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund. The RemCo 
has considered the policy it will adopt regarding pension provision after April 
2006 in the light of the government' s changes to pension taxation, and this is
described below.
Basic salaries
It is the policy of the RemCo to set basic salaries at levels which it believes are
competitive given the size and complexity of the Company, as well as the broad
business sectors in which it operates. To assist in this, Monks and NBSC provide
data and independent advice on remuneration levels in companies considered to 
be comparable in terms of annual sales, market capitalisation and industry sector.
The RemCo looks to set basic salaries at around the median of the identified
market, but also takes into account its own judgement of the performance of 
the Group' s businesses and the performance of individual Directors. The RemCo
intends to continue to use this approach in the foreseeable future.
The basic salaries of executive Directors are reviewed annually at 1 July and
the basic salaries following the review at 1 July 2005 are shown in the table
below. The average increase was 5.5%.
Salary at 
Name of Director 1 July 2005
J L Cohen  315,000
A L P Rabin  325,000
I P Tyler  470,000
A J Wivell  315,000
P J L Zinkin  338,000
Annual incentive plan
Each executive Director participates in an annual incentive plan, under which
predetermined financial targets must be achieved before any payment is earned.
The maximum potential bonus which could have been earned by executive
Directors for 2005 was 80% of basic salary and the performance indicator chosen
was profit before tax and exceptional items. A bonus of 40% of basic salary 
would have been earned for the achievement of performance in line with target.
Two-thirds of these bonuses are payable in cash, while the remaining one-third is
deferred in the form of ordinary shares of the Company. These shares will be
released to the Directors after three years, providing they are still employed by the
Company at that time. Bonuses are non-pensionable. The actual profit for the year
ended 31 December 2005 resulted in a bonus of 46.94% of basic salary for each
executive Director. Details are shown in the table on page 47.
The annual incentive plan for 2006 will operate in the same way as for 2005
and the RemCo will continue to review the competitiveness and structure of the
annual incentive plan in future years.
Long-term incentive scheme
The RemCo believes that performance related long-term incentives which align
executives with both business strategy and shareholders' interests are an
important component of overall executive remuneration arrangements.
Following the review of long-term incentives operated by the Company 
and the expiry of the PSP , proposals for a new Performance Share Plan (new PSP )
will be put to shareholders at the 2006 AGM. Full details of the proposals can be
found in the circular accompanying this report and a summary of the policy for 2006
is given below.
Conditional awards of ordinary shares of the Company will be made to
executive Directors and other selected operational and functional senior managers.
The maximum market value of any award, at the award date, will be 150% of basic
salary, other than in exceptional circumstances, where the limit is 200% of basic
salary. It is the intention of the RemCo that initially an award of 150% of basic
salary will only be made to the Chief Executive, with the other executive Directors
receiving conditional awards over shares with a market value of 125% of 
basic salary.
Remuneration report

Balfour Beatty plc
Annual report and accounts 2005 The awards will vest, subject to the achievement of performance conditions, three
years after the date of grant. For the initial award under the new arrangement,
there will be two performance conditions each applying to separate parts of 
an award.
50% of an award will be linked to an earnings per share before exceptional
items (EPS ) growth target, and will vest as shown in the table below:
EPS growth over three years Proportion of award vesting
Less than RPI + 15% Zero
RPI + 15% 25%
RPI + 45% 100%
Between RPI + 15% and RPI + 45% Between 25% and 100% pro rata
Growth in EPS will be determined following independent verification of the
calculations made internally.
The performance condition attached to the other 50% of an award will be
based on total shareholder return (TSR ) performance, measured against a 
group of UK listed companies operating in comparable markets to the Company.
The companies to be used for the initial award are as follows: Aggreko, AMEC, 
WS Atkins, Babcock International, Capita, Carillion, Costain, Enterprise, Hanson,
Interserve, Keller, Kier, John Laing, Alfred McAlpine, Morgan Sindall, Serco, Travis
Perkins and Wolseley.
The TSR performance of all companies will be measured over the three year
performance period, with the TSR of Balfour Beatty compared to the TSR of the
other companies. This part of an award will vest (in part) if Balfour Beatty' s TSR is
equivalent to that of the company whose TSR performance is at the median, with
full vesting if Balfour Beatty' s TSR is equivalent to, or above, that of the company
whose TSR performance is at the upper quartile. The precise scale of vesting is
shown in the table below:
Total shareholder return Proportion of award vesting
Below median Zero
Median 25%
Upper quartile 100%
Between median and upper quartile Between 25% and 100% pro rata
TSR will be independently calculated and verified by the RemCo.
There will be no provision for the re-testing of these performance conditions.
The RemCo considers that the EPS and TSR performance conditions provide 
a good blend of performance metrics, with EPS growth rewarding strong financial
performance and TSR rewarding stock market performance, providing a strong and
direct alignment with the interests of shareholders.
If approved by shareholders at the AGM, it is the intention of the RemCo to
make awards under the new PSP in 2006 and in future years, subject to review.
Pensions
The Company' s pension policy has been reviewed in the light of the changes to the
taxation of pensions being introduced from April 2006. The Company will not be
compensating any member of the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund (Fund ) (or any
other pension scheme operated by the Company) for any additional tax which is
payable as a result of the new legislation. In the event of a member choosing to
opt out of the Fund as a result of their benefits reaching or exceeding the Lifetime
Allowance, a cash supplement will be payable to them. An earnings cap will be
maintained in the Fund for those members who are subject to the existing earnings
cap and, in line with current policy, a discretionary cash supplement will be paid.
Members who are currently benefiting from contributions to a Funded Unapproved
Retirement Benefit Scheme (FURBS ) will be given the option of taking a cash
supplement of equivalent value.
Share ownership guidelines
To further align the interests of senior management with those of shareholders,
executive Directors and other key senior managers are subject to share ownership
guidelines. Executive Directors will be required to build up a holding in ordinary
shares of the Company to the value of 100% of basic salary. In order to achieve
this, they will be expected to retain at least half of the shares (after payment of 
any taxes due) which vest from awards made under the new PSP and the annual
incentive plan.
Executive share options
Since the introduction of the PSP in 2001, it has been the RemCo' s policy only to
make grants of executive share options to participants in the PSP in exceptional
circumstances, for example to recruit a high calibre individual. Grants of options
over ordinary shares of the Company were made to executive Directors before this
date, some of which remain valid and unexercised and are detailed in the table on
page 49. Certain managers below the level of those participating in the PSP have,
in 2004 and previous years, been granted options under the Executive Share Option
Scheme 2001. For 2005, selected managers have participated in an annual
incentive plan with a deferred share element similar to that described above, but
with lower levels of maximum bonus. It is intended that no further grants of
executive share options will be made to any level of management, except when it
is necessary to facilitate the recruitment of an outstanding individual.
Savings-related share option scheme
The Company continues to operate an Inland Revenue approved savings-related
share option scheme (SAYE ) under which employees are granted an option to
purchase shares in the Company in either three or five years time, dependent upon
their entering into a contract to make monthly contributions to a savings account
over the relevant period. These savings are used to fund the option exercise. 
The exercise price for the SAYE options granted in 2005 was at a 20% discount 
to market value at the date of invitation. This scheme is open to all employees
with one year' s service who are based in the UK, including executive Directors, 
and performance conditions are not applied to the exercise of SAYE options.
Executive Directors: notice periods
Since 1999, it has been the Company' s policy and practice to include in executive
Directors' contracts a 12 month rolling notice period from the Company and six
months' notice on the part of the Director. This policy will continue in the future.
Details of the service contracts of the executive Directors are shown in the 
table below.

Annual report and accounts 2005 Performance graph
The graph below shows Balfour Beatty' s Total Shareholder Return (TSR ) performance compared to the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment companies) TSR over the
five financial years ended 31 December 2005.
The values indicated in the graph show the share price growth plus reinvested dividends from a  100 hypothetical holding of ordinary shares in Balfour Beatty plc
and in the index at the start of the period and have been calculated using 30 trading day average values.
As in last year' s report, the RemCo has elected to compare the TSR on the Company's ordinary shares against the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment companies)
principally because this is a broad index of which the Company is a constituent member.

Service contracts of executive Directors do not include provision for specific
payment in the event of early termination, nor do they provide for extended notice
periods in the event of a change of control. It is not the RemCo's intention to
introduce such provisions. If any existing contract of employment is breached by
the Company in the event of termination, the Company would be liable to pay,
as damages, an amount approximating to the net loss of salary and contractual
benefits for the unexpired notice period. The RemCo will seek to ensure that the
Director fulfils his obligation to mitigate his losses and will also give consideration
to phased payments where appropriate.
External appointments
The RemCo recognises that benefits can arise from allowing executive Directors 
to take a non-executive role elsewhere. With approval of the Board in each case,
executive Directors may therefore accept one external appointment and retain 
any related fees. Jim Cohen was appointed as a non-executive Director of
office2office plc on 29 June 2004 and fees of  32,972 were paid to him for 
his services during the year ended 31 December 2005.
Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors are appointed by the full Board following
recommendations from the Nomination Committee. The Chairman' s remuneration
falls within the remit of the RemCo and the Board determines the terms on which
the services of other non-executive Directors are provided. All non-executive
Directors are elected for a term of three years and must retire and if eligible seek
re-election at the AGM in the third calendar year following the year they were
elected (or last re-elected). They are not eligible to join the Balfour Beatty Pension
Fund and cannot participate in any of the Company's share option, annual incentive
or long-term incentive schemes. None of the appointment letters for non-executive
Directors contain provision for specific payment in the event of termination for
whatever cause.
The dates of the letters of appointment or last election of the non-executive
Directors are shown in the table below.

The fees of the non-executive Directors are reviewed from time to time, the 
last review taking place in 2004, when the Board agreed an annual fee for the 
non-executive Directors (excluding the Chairman) of  33,000 with effect from 
1 July 2004. The RemCo also approved fees of  173,000 per annum for the
Chairman with effect from 1 July 2004.
Additional fees of  6,000 per annum were payable to Robert Walvis and
Richard Delbridge for their chairmanship of the RemCo and Audit Committees
respectively through 2005, and will be paid to Steven Marshall on his appointment
as chairman of the Audit Committee from 1 January 2006. A fee of a30,000 per
annum is payable to Christoph von Rohr for his chairmanship of the supervisory
board of Balfour Beatty Rail GmbH. The detailed information about the Directors' remuneration, set out on pages 47 to 50, has been reported on by the Company' s independent auditors, 
Deloitte & Touche LLP .

Notes:
(i) Basic salary and fees were those paid in respect of the period of the year during which individuals were Directors.
(ii) The performance target for annual bonus was profit before tax and exceptional items (profit ). The profit for the year ended 31 December 2005 resulted in a bonus
of 46.94% of basic salary for each executive Director. For Jim Cohen, Anthony Rabin, Ian Tyler and Peter Zinkin two-thirds of this bonus is payable in cash and these
are the amounts shown in the table above. The remaining one-third will be deferred in the form of ordinary shares of the Company which will be released to the
Director on 31 March 2009, providing he is still employed by the Company at that time. The number of shares comprising the deferred element will be determined
based on the share price at the award date of 31 March 2006. As Alistair Wivell retired on 31 December 2005, the entire bonus is payable in cash in March 2006
and this amount is given in the table above.
(iii) Christoph von Rohr receives a a30,000 per annum fee for his chairmanship of the supervisory board of Balfour Beatty Rail GmbH.
(iv) Benefits in kind are calculated in terms of UK taxable values. For the executive Directors they comprise: a fully expensed car, a fuel card, and private medical
insurance for the Director and his immediate family.
(v) No Director receives any expense allowance.

Notes:
(i) All awards are granted for nil consideration and are in respect of 50p ordinary shares of Balfour Beatty plc.
(ii) For the awards made in April 2004 and April 2005, the performance periods are the three years ending 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2007 respectively .
The maximum award of shares shown in the table above will vest only if earnings per share before exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and appropriations
arising on the buy-back of preference shares (EPS ) grows by at least 70% over the performance period. If EPS growth is 25%, the Directors will be entitled to
30% of the maximum award of shares. If EPS growth is between 25% and 70%, the number of shares vesting will be pro rata to actual growth. No shares will vest
if EPS growth is less than 25%, and there is no provision for re-testing.
(iii) For the awards made in April 2003, the performance period was the three years ended 31 December 2005. The maximum award of shares shown in the table
above would only vest if EPS grew by at least 100% over the performance period. If EPS growth was 30%, the Directors would have been entitled to 30% of the
maximum award of shares. If EPS growth was between 30% and 100%, the number of shares vesting would have been pro rata to actual growth. No shares would
vest if EPS growth was less than 30%, and there is no provision for re-testing.
(iv) The performance period for the awards made in April 2003 was completed on 31 December 2005. The growth in EPS for this period was 49.07% and as a result,
49.07% of each participant's conditional award will vest on 16 April 2006.
(v) The performance period for the awards made in April 2002 was completed on 31 December 2004. The growth in EPS for this period was 65.96% and as a result,
65.96% of each participant' s conditional award vested on 17 April 2005. The closing middle market price of ordinary shares on the vesting date was 297.0p.
(vi) The awards made to Alistair Wivell in 2004 and 2005 lapsed on his retirement from the Company on 31 December 2005. However, since he had 
been employed by the Company for the entirety of the performance period for the 2003 award, the RemCo decided it was appropriate to exercise its discretion 
in his favour and allow him to retain this award on his retirement from the Company, exercisable at the same time and in the same proportion as the awards of 
other participants.
(vii) The average middle market price of ordinary shares in the Company for the three dealing dates before the date of the 2002 award under the PSP , which was used 
for calculating the number of awards granted, was 237.583p, for the 2003 award was 172.66p, for the 2004 award was 260.417p and for the 2005 award was
305.417p. The closing middle market price of ordinary shares on the date of the awards was 251p, 170.5p, 260p and 290p respectively.

Balfour Beatty plc
Annual report and accounts 2005 Directors' pensions
Executive Directors participate in the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund. The scheme provides for a pension at a normal retirement age of 62 and each Director pays an 
annual contribution equal to 5% of pensionable salary. The pension for a Director who can complete 20 or more years' pensionable service at normal retirement age is
targeted at two-thirds of final pensionable salary, subject to Inland Revenue limits. Directors have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions, but neither the
contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the tables below. The salaries of Jim Cohen, Anthony Rabin and Ian Tyler were subject to the Inland Revenue
earnings cap for pension purposes and details of the Company' s contributions to additional arrangements for them are noted underneath the second table below.
The table below sets out the accrued deferred pension which would be paid annually from the scheme at normal retirement age based on each executive Director' s
service to 31 December 2005 as well as the additional pension benefit secured in respect of service during the year.

Notes:
(i) The transfer value of the increase in accrued deferred pension is the present value of the increase in excess of inflation in the deferred pension and associated
benefits during the period, less the Director' s contributions, calculated using the transfer basis in force at 31 December 2005 and on the basis of actuarial advice in
accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
(ii) Jim Cohen attained normal retirement age under the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund in February 2004 but has continued in service. As at 31 December 2005 his
pension had not commenced payment and it therefore continues to be determined in line with the rules of the fund for members past normal retirement age.
(iii) During the year, Anthony Rabin transferred benefits into the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund from previous pension arrangements. A total amount of  331,324 was
received in exchange for which he was awarded additional pensionable service of 9 years 81 days. A significant amount of the increase in deferred pension over the
year is therefore due to this additional pensionable service. The transfer value quoted in the final column is the increase in accrued deferred pension in excess of
inflation, less Anthony Rabin' s contributions over the year, less the transfer values actually received by the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund.
The table below sets out the transfer value at 31 December 2005 of each executive Director' s accrued deferred pension at that date as well as the movement in that
transfer value over the period. The transfer values represent the cash equivalent values that would have been payable from the scheme had the Directors left service on
the dates shown, and reflect the age of the Director, his period of membership of the scheme and his pensionable salary.

Notes:
(i) The transfer value is the present value of the accrued deferred pension and associated benefits at the relevant date, calculated using the transfer basis then in force
and on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
(ii) The figure is the difference between the transfer value of the accrued benefits at the start and end of the period, less the Director's contributions during the period.
(iii) During the year, Anthony Rabin transferred benefits into the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund from previous pension arrangements. A total amount of  331,324 was
received in exchange for which he was awarded additional pensionable service of 9 years 81 days. In the above table, contributions made by the Director during the
year includes the amount of the transfer values received by the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund.
(iv) Alistair Wivell retired on 31 December 2005 and took immediate pension benefits. The transfer value at 31 December 2005 is the actuarial value of these benefits.
The salaries of Jim Cohen, Anthony Rabin and Ian Tyler were subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap for pension purposes, and the Company has contributed to a
Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme (FURBS ) for each of them. In 2005, the Company's contribution to Jim Cohen' s plan was  34,004, to Anthony Rabin' s
 54,418 and to Ian Tyler's  51,133. Benefits under these FURBS are additional to those set out in the tables above.
No past Director of the Company has received or become entitled to receive retirement benefits in excess of his entitlements on the date on which those benefits
first became payable, or 31 March 1997 if later.
