 Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee of the Board (RemCo ) is primarily responsible
for determining the remuneration policy and conditions of service for executive
Directors and the Chairman of the Company. It also reviews and monitors the
level and structure of remuneration for senior management immediately below
the level of the Board. The terms of reference of the RemCo can be found on
the Company' s website.
The RemCo consists entirely of independent non-executive Directors and
has been chaired by Robert Walvis since November 2003. Its other members
are Stephen Howard, Steven Marshall, Christoph von Rohr and Gordon Sage.
Sir David John attends meetings by invitation. Chalmers Carr was also a
member of the RemCo until his retirement on 31 August 2006. No member 
of the RemCo has any personal financial interest, other than as a shareholder,
in the matters to be decided by the RemCo, nor potential conflicts of interest
arising from cross-directorships, and no member of the RemCo has any 
day-to-day involvement in the executive management of the Group.
During 2006 the Chief Executive, Ian Tyler, was invited to join meetings 
of the RemCo when appropriate. Paul Raby, the human resources director, 
has acted as secretary of the RemCo during the year. No Director has any
involvement in discussions relating to his own remuneration.
The RemCo is responsible for appointing external independent
consultants to advise on executive remuneration matters. This advice and
assistance has been provided to the RemCo throughout the year by New
Bridge Street Consultants LLP (NBSC ) and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
(PwC ). The human resources director has also provided advice to the RemCo.
The terms of reference of the independent consultants are available on the
Company' s website. During the year PwC also provided other tax and
consultancy services to the Company. The RemCo is satisfied that no conflict 
of interest arises from the provision of this advice.
Executive Directors' remuneration
General policy
It is the policy of the RemCo to provide an overall remuneration package that
is competitive and which facilitates the recruitment and retention of high
calibre management. The annual and long-term incentive plans make up an
important part of each executive Director's remuneration and are structured 
so as to motivate senior managers to deliver high standards of performance,
without encouraging excessive risk taking. It is intended that the share-based
elements of the package will not only drive performance over the long term
but will also assist in aligning the interests of senior management with 
those of shareholders.
A major review of remuneration was undertaken in 2005. As a result 
of this review, a new Performance Share Plan (the Plan ) was designed
and was approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2006. No further
changes have been made to the structure of remuneration during 2006 and no
significant changes to the existing remuneration policy are currently envisaged
for 2007. Under the current arrangements, if target performance is achieved,
basic salary will represent around one-half of total earnings. If maximum
performance is achieved, which would involve a superior level of performance
substantially in excess of business plan, basic salary will represent around
one-third of total earnings.
Executive Directors can join the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund. The policy
regarding pension provision was reviewed in the light of the changes to the
taxation of pensions, and the policy in place from April 2006 is described below.
Basic salaries
It is the policy of the RemCo to set basic salaries at levels which it believes
are competitive given the size and complexity of the Company, as well as the
broad business sectors in which it operates. To assist in this, NBSC and PwC
provide data and independent advice on remuneration levels in companies
considered to be comparable in terms of annual sales, market capitalisation
and industry sector. The RemCo looks to set basic salaries at around the
median of the market, but also takes into account its own judgement of the
performance of the Group' s businesses and the performance of individual
Directors. The RemCo intends to continue to use this approach in the
foreseeable future.
The basic salaries of executive Directors are reviewed annually at 1 July
and the basic salaries following the review at 1 July 2006 are shown in the
table below. The average increase was 7.3%.
Salary at 
Name of Director 1 July 2006
J L Cohen  330,000
A L P Rabin  355,000
I P Tyler  517,000
P J L Zinkin  355,000
Annual incentive plan
Each executive Director participates in an annual incentive plan, under which
predetermined financial targets must be achieved before any payment is
earned. The maximum potential bonus which could have been earned by
executive Directors for 2006 was 80% of basic salary and the performance
indicator chosen was profit before tax and exceptional items (profit ). 
A bonus of 40% of basic salary would have been earned for the achievement
of performance in line with target. Two-thirds of these bonuses are payable in
cash, while the remaining one-third is deferred in the form of ordinary shares
of the Company under the Deferred Bonus Plan (the DBP ). These shares,
along with shares awarded in lieu of dividends paid during the deferral period,
will be released to the Directors after three years, providing they are still
employed by the Company at that time. Bonuses are non-pensionable. 
The actual profit for the year ended 31 December 2006 resulted in a bonus 
of 65.94% of basic salary for each executive Director. Details are shown in 
the table on page 57.
Shares awarded under the DBP in respect of the annual incentive plan
are shown in the table on page 58.
The annual incentive plan for 2007 will operate in the same way as for
2006 and the RemCo will continue to review the competitiveness and structure
of the annual incentive plan in future years.
Long-term incentive scheme
The RemCo believes that performance related long-term incentives which 
align executives with both business strategy and shareholders interests 
are an important component of overall executive remuneration arrangements.
As stated above, in 2006, shareholders approved the Company' s
proposals for a new Performance Share Plan (the Plan ) to replace the
incentive plan previously approved in 2001. Under the Plan, conditional awards
of ordinary shares of the Company are made to executive Directors and other
selected operational and functional senior managers. The maximum market
value of any award, at the award date, will be 150% of basic salary, other
than in exceptional circumstances, where the limit is 200% of basic salary. 
It is currently the intention of the RemCo that an award of 150% of salary 
will only be made to the Chief Executive, with the other executive Directors
receiving conditional awards over shares with a market value of 125% 
of basic salary.
Remuneration report
54 Balfour Beatty plc
Annual report and accounts 2006 The awards will vest, subject to the achievement of performance conditions,
three years after the date of grant. It is the intention of the RemCo to make
awards under the Plan in 2007 and that the performance conditions will follow
a similar format to those which apply to the award made in 2006. For this
award there are two performance conditions each applying to separate parts
of the award.
50% of an award is linked to an adjusted earnings per share (EPS )
growth target, and will vest as shown in the table below:
EPS growth over three years Proportion of award vesting
Less than RPI + 15% Zero
RPI + 15% 25%
RPI + 45% 100%
Between RPI + 15% and RPI + 45% Between 25% and 100% pro-rata
Growth in EPS will be determined following independent verification of the
calculations made internally.
The performance condition attached to the other 50% of an award 
is based on total shareholder return (TSR ) performance, measured against 
a group of UK listed companies operating in comparable markets to the
Company. The companies used for the 2006 award are as follows: 
Aggreko, AMEC, WS Atkins, Babcock International, Capita, Carillion, 
Costain, Enterprise, Hanson, Interserve, Keller, Kier, John Laing,
Alfred McAlpine, Morgan Sindall, Serco, Travis Perkins and Wolseley.
The TSR performance of all companies will be measured over the 
three year performance period, with the TSR of Balfour Beatty compared 
to the TSR of the other companies. This part of an award will vest (in part) 
if Balfour Beatty' s TSR is equivalent to the company whose TSR performance
is at the median, with full vesting if Balfour Beatty' s TSR is equivalent to, 
or above, that of the company whose TSR performance is at the upper quartile.
The precise scale of vesting is shown in the table below:
Total shareholder return Proportion of award vesting
Below median Zero
Median 25%
Upper quartile 100%
Between median and upper quartile Between 25% and 100% pro rata
TSR will be independently calculated and verified by the RemCo.
There is no provision for the re-testing of these performance conditions.
The RemCo considers that the EPS and TSR performance conditions
provide a good blend of performance metrics, with EPS growth rewarding
strong financial performance and TSR rewarding stock market performance,
providing a strong and direct alignment with investors.
Pensions
The Company' s pension policy was reviewed in the light of the changes to the
taxation of pensions which were introduced in April 2006. The Company is not
compensating any member of the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund (the Fund ) 
(or any other pension scheme operated by the Company) for any additional 
tax which is payable as a result of the new legislation. In the event of a
member choosing to opt out of the Fund as a result of their benefits reaching
or exceeding the Lifetime Allowance, a cash supplement will be payable to 
them. A Fund specific earnings cap will be maintained in the Fund for those
members who were subject to the HMRC earnings cap and, in line with
previous policy, a discretionary cash supplement will be paid in lieu of pension
provision above the Fund specific earnings cap. Members who were benefiting
from contributions to a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme
(FURBS ) were given the choice to instead receive a cash supplement 
of equivalent value and, as a result, the Company ceased contributing 
to any FURBS from April 2006.
Share ownership guidelines
To further align the interests of senior management with those of shareholders,
executive Directors and other key senior managers are subject to share
ownership guidelines. Executive Directors are required to build up a holding 
in ordinary shares of the Company to the value of 100% of their basic salary
at a reference date. In order to achieve this, they will be expected to retain 
at least half of the shares (after payment of any taxes due) which vest from
awards made under the Plan and the DBP .
Executive share options
Since 2001, when a performance share plan was introduced, it has been the
RemCo' s policy only to make grants of executive share options to executive
Directors and other participants in the Plan (or its predecessor, the 2001
Performance Share Plan) in exceptional circumstances, for example to recruit 
a high calibre individual. No grants of options have been made under the
Executive Share Option Scheme 2001 since 31 December 2004. It remains the
intention of the RemCo that no further grants of executive share options will
be made to any level of management, other than in exceptional circumstances.
Savings-related share option scheme
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in a HMRC approved savings-
related share option scheme (SAYE ) under which employees based in the UK
are granted an option to purchase shares in the Company in either three or five
years time, dependent on their entering into a contract to make monthly
contributions to a savings account over the relevant period. The exercise price
for the SAYE options granted in 2006 was at a 20% discount to the market
value at the date of invitation.
Service contracts
Since 1999, it has been the Company' s policy and practice to include in
executive Directors' contracts a 12 month rolling notice period from the
Company and six months' notice on the part of the Director. This policy will
continue in the future.
Details of the service contracts of the executive Directors are shown 
in the table below.
Notice period from
Name of Director Date of contract Company (months)
J L Cohen 11 February 2000 12
A L P Rabin 28 August 2002 12
I P Tyler 22 December 2004 12
P J L Zinkin 10 December 1991 12
Service contracts of executive Directors do not include provision for specific
payment in the event of early termination, nor do they provide for extended
notice periods or compensation in the event of a change of control. It is not 
the RemCo' s intention to introduce such provisions. If any existing contract 
of employment is breached by the Company in the event of termination, the
Company would be liable to pay, as damages, an amount approximating to the
net loss of salary and contractual benefits for the unexpired notice period. The
RemCo will seek to ensure that the Director fulfils his obligation to mitigate his
losses and will also give consideration to phased payments where appropriate.

Our governance External appointments
The RemCo recognises that benefits can arise from allowing executive
Directors to take a non-executive role elsewhere. With approval of the 
Board in each case, executive Directors may therefore accept one external
appointment and retain any related fees. Jim Cohen was appointed as 
a non-executive Director of office2office plc on 29 June 2004 and fees 
of  34,171 were paid to him for his services during the year ended 
31 December 2006.
Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors are appointed by the full Board following
recommendations from the Nomination Committee. The Chairman' s
remuneration falls within the remit of the RemCo and the Board determines
the terms on which the services of other non-executive Directors are provided.
All non-executive Directors are elected for a term of three years and must
retire and if eligible seek re-election at the AGM in the third calendar year
following the year in which they were elected (or last re-elected). They are 
not eligible to join any pension scheme operated by the Company and cannot
participate in any of the Company' s share option, annual incentive or long-term
incentive schemes. None of the appointment letters for non-executive
Directors contain provision for specific payment in the event of termination 
for whatever cause.
The dates of the letters of appointment or last election (or last re-election) 
of the non-executive Directors are shown in the table below.

*Retired on 31 August 2006
The fees of the non-executive Directors are reviewed from time to time, 
the last review taking place in 2006, when the Board agreed an increase in the
annual fee for the non-executive Directors (excluding the Chairman) from
 33,000 to  42,000 with effect from 1 July 2006. This increase reflects the
requirement of each non-executive Director to spend an additional four days
per annum within the Group operating companies. The RemCo approved an
increase from  173,000 to  190,000 per annum in the fees for the Chairman
with effect from 1 July 2006.
Additional fees are payable to Robert Walvis and Steven Marshall for
their chairmanship of the RemCo and Audit Committees respectively. These
fees were increased from  6,000 to  7,000 per annum with effect from 1 July
2006. A fee of B30,000 per annum is payable to Christoph von Rohr for his
chairmanship of the supervisory board of Balfour Beatty Rail GmbH.

Notes:
(i) Basic salary and fees were those paid in respect of the period of the year during which individuals were Directors.
(ii) Jim Cohen, Anthony Rabin and Ian Tyler received taxable cash supplements in lieu of pension provision on their salary above the Balfour Beatty Pension
Fund specific earnings cap, from April 2006. Prior to this date the Company contributed to a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme (FURBS ) 
for each of them. Details of contributions made to FURBS during the year can be found under the second table on page 60.
(iii) The performance target for annual bonus was profit before tax and exceptional items (profit ). The profit for the year ended 31 December 2006 resulted 
in a bonus of 65.94% of basic salary for each executive Director. For Anthony Rabin, Ian Tyler and Peter Zinkin two-thirds of this bonus is payable in cash
and these are the amounts shown in the table above. The remaining one-third will be deferred in the form of ordinary shares of the Company which will 
be released to the Director on 31 March 2010, providing he is still employed by the Company at that time. The number of shares comprising the deferred
element will be determined based on the share price at the award date of 30 March 2007. As Jim Cohen retired on 18 February 2007, the entire bonus 
is payable in cash in March 2007 and this amount is shown in the table above.
(iv) Christoph von Rohr receives a fee of B30,000 per annum for his chairmanship of the supervisory board of Balfour Beatty Rail GmbH.
(v) Benefits in kind are calculated in terms of UK taxable values. For the executive Directors they comprise: a fully expensed car , a fuel card, private medical
insurance for the Director and his immediate family and independent financial advice.

Notes:
(i) All awards are granted for nil consideration and are in respect of 50p ordinary shares of Balfour Beatty plc.
(ii) For the awards made in April 2004 and April 2005, the performance periods are the three years ending 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2007
respectively. The maximum award of shares shown in the table above will vest only if earnings per share before exceptional items and amortisation of
intangible assets (EPS ) grows by at least 70% over the performance period. If EPS growth is 25%, the Directors will be entitled to 30% of the maximum
award of shares. If EPS growth is between 25% and 70%, the number of shares vesting will be pro rata to actual growth. No shares will vest if EPS growth
is less than 25%, and there is no provision for retesting.
(iii) For the awards made in June 2006, the performance period is the three years ending 31 December 2008. 50% of each award is subject to an EPS growth
target. The maximum number of shares subject to this performance condition will only vest if EPS growth exceeds the retail prices index (RPI ) by 45%.
If EPS growth exceeds RPI by 15% then 25% of this part of the award will vest. For growth in EPS between these points, vesting will be on a pro rata
basis. No shares will vest from this part of the award if EPS growth exceeds RPI by less than 15%. The other 50% of each award is subject to a total
shareholder return (TSR ) target under which the TSR of the Company is compared to that of a comparator group of 18 UK listed companies. The
maximum number of shares subject to this performance condition will only vest if the Company's TSR is at the upper quartile of the comparator group. If the
Company' s TSR is equal to that of the median of the comparator group then 25% of this part of the award will vest. No shares from this part of the award
will vest if the Company' s TSR is below that of the median of the comparator group. For TSR performance between median and upper quartile, vesting will
be on a pro rata basis. There is no provision for retesting of either of the performance conditions.
(iv) The performance period for the awards made in April 2004 was completed on 31 December 2006. The growth in EPS for this period was 40.33% and 
as a result, 53.85% of each participant's conditional award will vest on 19 April 2007.
(v) The performance period for the awards made in April 2003 was completed on 31 December 2005. The growth in EPS for this period was 49.07% and 
as a result, 49.07% of each participant' s conditional award vested on 18 April 2006. The closing middle market price of ordinary shares on the vesting 
date was 370.5p.
(vi) The average middle market price of ordinary shares in the Company for the three dealing dates before the award dates which was used for calculating 
the number of awards granted, was 172.66p for the 2003 award, 260.417p for the 2004 award, 305.417p for the 2005 award and for the 2006 award 
was 308.417p. The closing middle market price of ordinary shares on the date of the awards was 170.5p, 260p, 290p and 301.25p respectively .

Our governance Directors' pensions
Executive Directors participate in the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund. The scheme provides for a pension at a normal retirement age of 62 (under Balfour Beatty
Pension Fund rules) and each Director pays an annual contribution equal to 5% of pensionable salary. The pension for a Director who can complete 20 or more
years' pensionable service at normal retirement age is targeted at two-thirds of final pensionable salary, subject to HMRC limits. With effect from 6 April 2006,
HMRC limits were changed, and as a result the earnings cap is no longer used when determining the maximum permissible benefits. However, the Balfour Beatty
Pension Fund has retained a Fund specific earnings cap. The salaries of Jim Cohen, Anthony Rabin and Ian Tyler were subject to the Fund specific earnings cap for
pension purposes and details of the Company' s contributions to additional arrangements for them are noted underneath the second table below. Directors have
the option to pay additional voluntary contributions, but neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the tables below.
The table below sets out the accrued deferred pension which would be paid annually from the scheme at normal retirement age based on each executive
Director' s service to 31 December 2006 as well as the additional pension benefit secured in respect of service during the year.

Notes:
(i) The transfer value of the increase in accrued deferred pension is the present value of the increase in excess of inflation in the deferred pension and
associated benefits during the period, less the Director's contributions, calculated using the transfer basis in force at 31 December 2006 and on the basis 
of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
(ii) Anthony Rabin' s pensionable service includes nine years of transferred-in service from previous pension arrangements.
(iii) Jim Cohen attained normal retirement age under the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund in February 2004 but has continued in service. As at 31 December 
2006 his pension had not commenced payment and it therefore continues to be determined in line with the rules of the Fund for members past normal
retirement age.
The table below sets out the transfer value at 31 December 2006 of each executive Director's accrued deferred pension at that date as well as the movement 
in that transfer value over the period. The transfer values represent the cash equivalent values that would have been payable from the scheme had the
Directors left service on the dates shown, and reflect the age of the Director, his period of membership of the scheme and his pensionable salary.

Notes:
(i) The transfer value is the present value of the accrued deferred pension and associated benefits at the relevant date, calculated using the transfer basis
then in force and on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
(ii) The figure is the difference between the transfer value of the accrued benefits at the start and end of the period, less the Director' s contributions during 
the period.
The salaries of Jim Cohen, Anthony Rabin and Ian Tyler were subject to the Fund specific earnings cap for pension purposes, and the Company contributed to a
Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme (FURBS ) for each of them up to 31 March 2006. In 2006, the Company' s contribution to Jim Cohen' s plan was
 8,708, to Anthony Rabin' s  14,036 and to Ian Tyler' s  13,205. Benefits under these FURBS are additional to those set out in the tables above. From April 2006,
the Company has paid a taxable cash supplement instead of contributions to a FURBS. Details can be found in the table on page 57.
No past Director of the Company has received or become entitled to receive retirement benefits in excess of his entitlements on the date on which those
benefits first became payable, or 31 March 1997 if later.
