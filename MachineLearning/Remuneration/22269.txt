  
Remuneration report 
18 
Introduction 
This report has been prepared in accordance with schedule 7A to the 
Companies Act 1985. The report also meets the relevant requirements of  
the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how  
the Board has applied the principles relating to Directors' remuneration in 
the Combined Code. As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the 
report will be proposed at the AGM of the Company at which the financial 
statements will be approved. 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee of the Board (RemCo ) is primarily 
responsible for determining the remuneration policy and conditions of 
service for executive Directors and the Chairman of the Company. It also 
reviews and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for certain 
senior managers immediately below the level of the Board. The terms of 
reference of the RemCo, which were reviewed in October 2008, can be 
found on the Company's website www.balfourbeatty.com.  
The RemCo has been chaired by Robert Walvis since November 2003. 
Its other members during the year were Stephen Howard, Steve Marshall, 
Gordon Sage, Christoph von Rohr until September 2008 and, from 
September 2008, Hubertus Krossa. Sir David John, the former Company 
Chairman, attended meetings by invitation. No member of the RemCo  
has conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no member  
is involved in the day-to-day executive management of the Group.  
During 2008 the Chief Executive, Ian Tyler, was invited to join meetings 
of the RemCo, when appropriate. Paul Raby, the human resources director, 
acted as secretary of the RemCo until September 2008 at which point  
this role transferred to the Company Secretariat. No Director has any 
involvement in discussions relating to his own remuneration. 
The RemCo is responsible for appointing external independent 
consultants to advise on executive remuneration matters. This advice and 
assistance has been provided throughout the year by Hewitt New Bridge 
Street LLP (HNBS ) and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC ). The human 
resources director has also provided advice to the RemCo. During the year, 
PwC also provided other tax and consultancy services to the Company.  
The RemCo is satisfied that no conflict of interest arises from the provision 
of this advice. 
Executive Directors' remuneration 
General policy 
It is the policy of the RemCo to establish an overall remuneration package 
that is competitive and which facilitates the recruitment and retention of 
high calibre management. The annual and long-term incentive plans make 
up an important part of each executive Director's remuneration and are 
structured so as to motivate senior managers to deliver high standards of 
performance, without encouraging excessive risk taking. It is intended that 
the share-based elements of the package will not only drive performance 
over the long-term but will also assist in aligning the interests of senior 
management with those of shareholders.  
The structure of executive Directors' remuneration was similar in  
2008 to that in 2007 and no significant changes to the existing policy are 
currently envisaged for 2009. Under the current arrangements, if target 
performance is achieved, basic salary will represent around one-half of  
total earnings. If maximum is achieved, which would involve a superior  
level of performance substantially in excess of business plan, basic salary 
will represent around one-third of total earnings. 
The executive Directors are eligible to be members of the Balfour 
Beatty Pension Fund and the general pensions policy is described below. 
Basic salaries 
It is the policy of the RemCo to set basic salaries at levels which it believes 
are competitive given the size and complexity of the Company, as well as 
the broad business sectors in which it operates. To assist in this, HNBS and  
PwC provide data and independent advice on remuneration levels in 
companies considered to be comparable in terms of annual sales, market 
capitalisation and industry sector. The RemCo sets basic salaries around 
mid-market levels, but also takes into account its own judgement of the 
performance of the Group's businesses and the performance of individual 
Directors. The RemCo intends to continue to use this approach in the 
foreseeable future. 
The basic salaries for the executive Directors are reviewed annually  
at 1 July. The salary for Duncan Magrath was set at  340,000 effective  
from his appointment as Finance Director on 31 March 2008 and was  
not reviewed again during the year. The basic salaries of the other three 
executive Directors, following the review at 1 July 2008, are shown in the 
table below. The average increase was 9.0% based on a review of personal 
performance, market position and recognition of new responsibilities for 
Anthony Rabin.  
Name of Director 
Salary at 
1 July 2008 
A L P Rabin  425,000
I P Tyler  630,000
P J L Zinkin  405,000
Annual incentive plan 
Each executive Director participates in an annual incentive plan, under 
which pre-determined financial targets must be achieved before any 
payment is earned. The maximum potential bonus which could have been 
earned by executive Directors for 2008 was 80% of basic salary and the 
performance indicator chosen was profit before tax, exceptional items and 
amortisation of intangible assets (profit ). A bonus of 40% of basic salary 
would have been earned for the achievement of performance in line with 
target. Two-thirds of any bonus achieved is payable in cash, whilst the 
remaining one-third is deferred in the form of ordinary shares in the 
Company under the Deferred Bonus Plan (the DBP ). These shares, along 
with shares awarded in lieu of dividends paid during the deferral period,  
will be released to the Directors after three years, providing they are still 
employed by the Company at that time (unless specified leaver conditions 
are met, in which case early vesting may be permitted under the rules of  
the DBP). Bonuses are non-pensionable. The actual profit for the year ended 
31 December 2008 resulted in a maximum bonus of 80% of basic salary  
for each executive Director. Details are shown in the table on page 21. 
It is currently intended that the annual incentive plan for 2009 will 
operate in the same way and at the same level as for 2008 and the RemCo 
will continue to review the competitiveness and structure of the annual 
incentive plan in future years. 
Long-term incentive scheme 
The RemCo believes that performance related long-term incentives which 
align executives with both business strategy and shareholders' interests are 
an important component of overall executive remuneration arrangements.  
The Company operates a Performance Share Plan (the PSP ) under 
which conditional awards of shares in the Company are made to executive 
Directors and other selected operational and functional senior managers. 
The maximum market value of any award, at the award date, will be 150% 
of basic salary, other than in exceptional circumstances, where the limit  
is 200% of basic salary. It is currently the intention of the RemCo that an 
award of 150% of salary will only be made to the Chief Executive, with  
the other executive Directors and selected senior managers receiving 
conditional awards over shares with a market value of 125% of basic salary.  
The awards will vest, subject to the achievement of performance 
conditions, three years after the date of grant, together with shares  
in lieu of dividends payable. There is no provision for the re-testing of these 
performance conditions. For the 2008 award, there are two performance 
conditions, each applying to separate parts of the award.    
19
50% of an award is linked to an adjusted earnings per share (EPS ) growth 
target, and will vest as shown in the table below.  
EPS growth over three years Proportion of award vesting 
Less than RPI + 15% Zero 
RPI + 15% 25% 
RPI + 45% 100% 
Between RPI + 15% and RPI + 45% Between 25% and 100% pro-rata
Growth in EPS will be determined following independent verification of the 
calculations made internally. 
The performance condition attached to the other 50% of an award is 
linked to total shareholder return (TSR ) performance, measured against  
a group of UK listed companies operating in comparable markets to the 
Company. The companies used for the 2008 award were as follows: 
Aggreko, Atkins (WS), Babcock International, Capita, Carillion, Costain, 
Interserve, Keller, Kier, MITIE, Morgan Sindall, Serco, SIG, Travis Perkins 
and Wolseley.  
The TSR performance of all companies will be measured over the three 
year performance period, with the TSR of Balfour Beatty compared to the 
TSR of the other companies. This part of an award will vest in part if Balfour 
Beatty's TSR is equivalent to the company whose TSR performance is at the 
median, with full vesting if Balfour Beatty's TSR is equivalent to, or above, 
that of the company whose TSR performance is at the upper quartile.  
The precise scale of vesting is shown in the table below: 
Total shareholder return Proportion of award vesting 
Below median Zero 
Median 25% 
Upper quartile 100% 
Between median and upper quartile Between 25% and 100% pro-rata
TSR will be independently calculated and approved by the RemCo.  
The RemCo considers that the EPS and TSR performance conditions 
provide a good blend of performance metrics, with EPS growth rewarding 
strong financial performance and TSR rewarding stock market performance, 
which aligns with investors' interests. 
It is the intention of the RemCo to make awards under the PSP in 2009. 
For the TSR element of the award, it is currently anticipated that a similar 
peer group of companies will be used. The RemCo is currently reviewing  
the EPS targets and individual levels of award, to ensure these continue  
to remain stretching and appropriate given current market conditions and 
business outlook.  
The PSP and other share schemes contain provisions relating to a 
change of control. Outstanding awards and options would normally vest  
and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction  
of any performance conditions at that time.  
Pensions 
The Company provides pension benefits to UK employees principally  
through the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund (the Fund ), which has both 
defined benefit (DB ) and defined contribution (DC ) sections. The DB 
section provides for the build up of pension benefits based on different 
accrual rates (as determined by job position) and has life cover, disability 
and spouse/dependants pension arrangements.  
Following the changes to the taxation of pensions which were 
introduced in April 2006, a Fund-specific earnings cap has been maintained 
for those members who were previously subject to the HMRC earnings  
cap. This cap also applies to members of the DC section of the Fund.  
A discretionary cash supplement is paid in lieu of pension provision above 
the earnings cap. The Company is not compensating any member of the 
Fund (or any other pension scheme operated by the Company) for any 
additional tax which is payable as a result of the April 2006 legislation.  
If members choose to opt out of the Fund as a result of their benefits 
reaching or exceeding the lifetime allowance, a cash supplement will  
be paid to them.  
The specific pension arrangements for executive Directors are outlined 
in more detail in the Directors' pensions section on pages 24 and 25.  
During 2008 the Company announced new measures to limit the 
growth of liabilities in the DB section of the Fund. These will, in effect, limit 
future increases in basic salary which will count for DB purposes to a level 
set by the Company each year. This figure will ordinarily be RPI up to a cap 
of 5%. Any increase in basic salary above that limit will be eligible for DC 
benefits from the Fund.  
Share ownership guidelines 
To further align the interests of senior management with those of 
shareholders, executive Directors and certain other senior managers are 
subject to share ownership guidelines. Executive Directors are required to 
accumulate a holding of ordinary shares in the Company to the value of 
100% of their basic salary at a reference date. In order to achieve this,  
they will be expected to retain at least half of the shares (after payment of 
any taxes due) which vest from awards made under the PSP and the DBP.  
Share options 
No grants of options have been made under the Executive Share Option 
Scheme 2001 since 31 December 2004 and it remains the intention of the 
RemCo that no further grants will be made under this scheme to any level  
of management, other than in exceptional circumstances. 
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in a HMRC approved 
savings-related share option scheme.  
Service contracts 
It remains the Company's policy and practice to include in executive 
Directors' contracts a 12 months' rolling notice period from the Company  
and six months' notice on the part of the Director. This policy will continue.  
Details of the service contracts of the executive Directors are shown  
in the table below. 
Name of Director Date of contract 
Notice period from 
Company (months) 
D J Magrath 31 March 2008  12
A L P Rabin 28 August 2002 12
I P Tyler 22 December 2004 12
P J L Zinkin 10 December 1991 12
Service contracts of executive Directors do not include provision for specific 
payment in the event of early termination, nor do they provide for extended 
notice periods or compensation in the event of a change of control. It is not 
the RemCo's intention to introduce such provisions. If any existing contract 
of employment is breached by the Company in the event of termination, the 
Company would be liable to pay, as damages, an amount approximating  
to the net loss of salary and contractual benefits for the unexpired notice 
period. The RemCo would seek to ensure that the Director fulfils his 
obligation to mitigate his losses and would also give consideration to 
phased payments where appropriate. 
Andrew McNaughton was appointed to the Board as Chief Operating 
Officer on 1 January 2009, with the same notice and termination provisions 
as the other executive Directors. 
External appointments 
The RemCo recognises that benefits can arise from allowing executive 
Directors to take a non-executive directorship elsewhere. With approval  
of the Board in each case, executive Directors may therefore accept one 
external appointment and retain any related fees. Ian Tyler was appointed 
as a non-executive director of VT Group plc on 12 May 2008. The fees 
received for this role are set out in the notes to the Directors' remuneration 
table on page 21.  
Non-executive Directors 
Non-executive Directors are appointed by the full Board following 
recommendations from the Nomination Committee. The Chairman's 
remuneration falls within the remit of the RemCo operating within the broad 
policy recommended by the RemCo and approved by the Board. The Board 
determines the terms on which the services of other non-executive Directors 
are provided. All non-executive Directors are elected for a term of three 
years and must retire and, if eligible, seek re-election at the AGM in the 
third calendar year following the year in which they were elected (or last  
re-elected). They are not eligible to join any pension scheme operated by  
the Company and cannot participate in any of the Company's share option, 
annual incentive or long-term incentive schemes. None of the appointment 
letters for non-executive Directors contain provision for specific payment in 
the event of termination for whatever cause.

The fees of the non-executive Directors are reviewed from time to time with the last review having taken effect from 1 July 2008, when the Board agreed 
an increase in the annual fees (excluding the Chairman) from  42,000 to  48,000 and for Steve Marshall as Chairman to  240,000 per annum. The annual 
fee for chairing Board Committees was increased from  7,000 to  8,000 with effect from 1 July 2008. During the year, the RemCo was chaired by Robert 
Walvis, the Audit Committee by Steve Marshall, and the Business Practices Committee by Sir David John up to May 2008 and Stephen Howard for the 
remainder of the year. 
A fee of  30,000 was paid to Christoph von Rohr for his chairmanship of the supervisory board of Balfour Beatty Rail GmbH until 31 December 2008. 
Hubertus Krossa joined the supervisory board of Balfour Beatty Rail GmbH on 1 December 2008 and was appointed chairman on 1 January 2009.  
He received fees of  2,000 for his services to the supervisory board in 2008. 
Performance graph 
The graph below shows Balfour Beatty's TSR performance compared to the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) TSR over the five financial years 
ended 31 December 2008. 
As in previous reports, the RemCo has elected to compare the TSR on the Company's ordinary shares against the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment 
trusts) principally because this is a broad index of which the Company was a constituent member during the year. 
The values indicated in the graph show the share price growth plus reinvested dividends from a  100 hypothetical holding of ordinary shares in Balfour 
Beatty plc and in the index, at the start of the period and have been calculated using 30 trading day average values.

Notes: 
(i)  Basic salary and fees were those paid in respect of the period of the year during which individuals were Directors.  
(ii) Ian Tyler, Anthony Rabin and Duncan Magrath received taxable cash supplements in lieu of pension provision on their salary above the Balfour Beatty 
Pension Fund specific earnings cap. 
(iii) The performance target for annual bonus was profit before tax, exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets (profit ). The profit for the year 
ended 31 December 2008 resulted in a maximum bonus of 80% of basic salary for each executive Director. Two-thirds of this bonus is payable in cash 
and these are the amounts shown in the table above. The remaining one-third is deferred in the form of ordinary shares in the Company which will be 
released to the Director on 31 March 2012, providing he is still employed by the Company at that time. The number of shares comprising the deferred 
element will be determined based on the share price at the award date of 31 March 2009.  
(iv) Christoph von Rohr received an additional fee of  30,000 for his chairmanship of the supervisory board of Balfour Beatty Rail GmbH. 
(v)  Hubertus Krossa received an additional fee of  2,000 related to his membership of the supervisory board of Balfour Beatty Rail GmbH. 
(vi)  In addition, Ian Tyler received a fee of  24,577 for his services as a non-executive director of VT Group plc. 
(vii) Benefits in kind are calculated in terms of UK taxable values. All executive Directors receive private medical insurance for the Director and his 
immediate family. Ian Tyler, Anthony Rabin and Peter Zinkin receive a fully expensed car and a fuel card. Duncan Magrath receives a car allowance  
of  14,000 p.a.  
(viii) No Director receives any expense allowance.  
(ix) Awards made under the Performance Share Plan in 2005 to Ian Tyler, Anthony Rabin, and Peter Zinkin vested during the year. At the date of vesting on 
18 April 2008 the closing market price was 463p and the total values of the shares which vested were  546,354,  378,720, and  403,555 respectively. 
(x) Ian Tyler, Anthony Rabin, and Peter Zinkin exercised savings-related share options during the year. The closing market prices on the dates of exercise 
ranged between 411.25p and 400.0p and the values realisable on exercise were  4,184,  1,826, and  3,450 respectively.

Notes: 
(i)  All awards are granted for nil consideration and are in respect of 50p ordinary shares in Balfour Beatty plc. It is the Company's current intention that 
awards will be satisfied by shares purchased in the market. 
(ii)  For the awards made in June 2006, April 2007 and April 2008, the performance periods are the three years ending 31 December 2008, 31 December 
2009 and 31 December 2010 respectively. 50% of each award is subject to an EPS growth target. The maximum number of shares subject to this 
performance condition will only vest if EPS growth exceeds the retail prices index (RPI ) by 45% over the performance period. If EPS growth exceeds 
RPI by 15% then 25% of this part of the award will vest. For growth in EPS between these points, vesting will be on a pro-rata basis. No shares will 
vest from this part of the award if EPS growth exceeds RPI by less than 15%. The other 50% of each award is subject to a total shareholder return 
(TSR ) target under which the TSR of the Company is compared to that of a comparator group of similar companies listed in the UK at the start of the 
performance period. The maximum number of shares subject to this performance condition will only vest if the Company's TSR is at the upper quartile 
of the comparator group. If the Company's TSR is equal to that of the median of the comparator group then 25% of this part of the award will vest.  
No shares from this part of the award will vest if the Company's TSR is below that of the median of the comparator group. For TSR performance 
between median and upper quartile, vesting will be on a pro-rata basis. There is no provision for re-testing of either of the performance conditions.  
(iii) The average middle market price of ordinary shares in the Company for the three dealing dates before the award dates, which was used for calculating 
the number of awards granted, was 305.417p for the 2005 award, 308.417p for the 2006 award, 491.583p for the 2007 award and 449.17p for the 2008 
award. The closing middle market price of ordinary shares on the date of the awards was 290p, 301.25p, 490.75p and 450p respectively. 
(iv) The performance period for the awards made in June 2006 was completed on 31 December 2008. The growth in EPS for this period exceeded RPI  
by more than 45%. The Company's TSR for this period ranked between sixth and seventh of the 14 remaining companies in the comparator group.  
The combined effect of these performance measures is that 69.6% of each participant's conditional award will vest on 13 June 2009. Each participant 
will also receive shares equal in value to the dividends, which would have been payable on the shares which vest.  
(v)  The performance period for the awards made in April 2005 was completed on 31 December 2007. The growth in EPS for this period was 58.37% and  
as a result, 81.91% of each participant's conditional award  vested on 18 April 2008. The closing middle market price of ordinary shares on the vesting 
date was 463p.

Notes: 
(i)  All options are granted under the savings-related share option scheme, for nil consideration on grant and are in respect of 50p ordinary shares in 
Balfour Beatty plc. 
(ii)  The closing market price of the Company's ordinary shares on 31 December 2008 was 329.25p. During the year the highest and lowest closing market 
prices were 497.25p and 224.25p respectively. 
Directors' pensions 
The executive Directors participate in the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund (the Fund ). The Fund provides for a pension at a normal retirement age, for pension 
purposes, of 62 and each Director pays an annual contribution equal to 5% of pensionable salary. The pension for a Director who can complete 20 or more 
years' pensionable service at normal retirement age is targeted at two-thirds of final pensionable salary, subject to HMRC limits. With effect from 6 April 
2006, HMRC limits were changed, with one of the changes being to no longer use the earnings cap, when determining the maximum permissible benefits. 
However, the Fund has retained a Fund specific earnings cap for pension purposes. The salaries of Ian Tyler, Anthony Rabin and Duncan Magrath are 
subject to the Fund-specific earnings cap for pension purposes and details of the Company's contributions to additional arrangements for them are shown  
in the Directors' remuneration table on page 21.  
The table below sets out the accrued deferred pension which would be paid annually from the Fund at normal retirement age based on each executive 
Director's service to 31 December 2008 as well as the additional pension benefit secured in respect of service during the year.

Notes: 
(i) The transfer value of the increase in accrued deferred pension is the present value of the increase in excess of inflation in the deferred pension and 
associated benefits during the period, less the Director's contributions. Transfer values before 1 October 2008 were calculated on the basis of actuarial 
advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11. Transfer values with effective dates after 1 October 2008 are calculated using the transfer 
value basis as determined by the Fund Trustee in accordance with the new transfer value regulations. 
 (ii) Anthony Rabin's pensionable service includes nine years of transferred-in service from previous pension arrangements.

The table below sets out the transfer value at 31 December 2008 of each executive Director's accrued deferred pension at that date as well as the 
movement in that transfer value over the period. The transfer values represent the cash equivalent values that would have been payable from the Fund  
had the Directors left service on the dates shown, and reflect the age of the Director, his period of Fund membership and his pensionable salary.
