REMUNERA TION REPORT 
Annual report and accounts 2010 89
Introductory letter 
Dear Shareholder  
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committee's report on 
Directors' remuneration for 2010. 
During the year, the Committee carried out a comprehensive review 
of the Company's remuneration arrangements and is proposing some 
changes to the remuneration policy with effect from 2011.  
Since the last detailed review in 2005, the business has grown 
significantly in terms of revenue and employee numbers, and now 
has a significant international presence across the entire lifecycle of 
major infrastructure assets. Consistent with the changing nature of 
the business, the scope and complexity of senior executives' roles 
within the Company has also changed.  
While the Committee considers that the remuneration policy operated 
since 2005 has complemented the strategy effectively and rewarded 
executives fairly, the review concluded that a number of evolutionary 
changes should be made. This is to ensure that the policy continues 
to provide a strong link between executives' and shareholders' interests 
through focussing on the outputs of the Company's strategy, namely 
sustainable profit growth and shareholder returns.  
As part of the review, the Committee developed proposals for a new 
Performance Share Plan to replace the existing plan, which has reached 
the end of its five-year life.  
In developing these proposed changes we have consulted with the 
Company's major institutional shareholders and their representative 
bodies.  
The proposals are set out in this report and the resolutions, both 
to adopt this report and to seek shareholder approval for the new 
Performance Share Plan, will be put to the Annual General Meeting. 
I hope you will support these proposals which the Remuneration 
Committee believes are in the interests of shareholders. 
Yours sincerely 
 
 
 
 
Robert Walvis 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
  OUR GOVERNANCE - REMUNERATION REPORT 
Balfour Beatty 90 
Introduction 
This report has been prepared in accordance with Section 420 of the 
Companies Act 2006 (the Act ) and Schedules 5 and 8 of the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008. The report also meets the relevant requirements of 
the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how 
the Board has applied the principles relating to Directors' remuneration 
in the Combined Code. As required by the Act, a resolution to approve 
the report will be proposed at the AGM of the Company. 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee of the Board (RemCo ) is primarily 
responsible for determining the remuneration policy and conditions 
of service for executive Directors and the Chairman of the Company. 
It also reviews and monitors the level and structure of remuneration 
for certain senior managers immediately below the level of the Board. 
The terms of reference of the RemCo, which were last reviewed in 
October 2008, can be found on the Company's website 
www.balfourbeatty.com 
The RemCo has been chaired by Robert Walvis since November 2003. 
Its other members during the year were Hubertus Krossa, Steve 
Marshall, Gordon Sage, Iain Ferguson and, from November 2010, 
Graham Roberts. No member of the RemCo has conflicts of interest 
arising from cross-directorships and no member is involved in the  
day-to-day executive management of the Group. 
During 2010 the Chief Executive, Ian Tyler, and the Human Resources 
director, Paul Raby, were invited to join meetings of the RemCo, when 
appropriate. The role of secretary of the RemCo is fulfilled by the Head 
of Secretariat. No Director has any involvement in any decisions relating 
to his own remuneration. 
The RemCo is responsible for appointing external independent 
consultants to advise on executive remuneration matters. This advice 
and assistance has been provided throughout the year by Hewitt New 
Bridge Street (HNBS ). The Human Resources director has also 
provided advice to the RemCo. 
Remuneration policy and company strategy  
The RemCo has pursued a consistent remuneration policy over 
a number of years. The 2010 remuneration review examined the 
Company's strategy closely and re-affirmed the link to the remuneration 
policy, which is summarised below:  
- Remuneration levels must be positioned such that they provide a 
competitive level of remuneration, to enable the recruitment and 
retention of high calibre management. It is vital that we continue 
to be able to attract, retain and motivate those individuals who can 
lead the business so as to achieve its short and long-term goals. 
To meet this objective we need to ensure that remuneration 
levels are appropriately positioned against the external market 
and that compensation packages are seen as fair and reasonable. 
The Committee is, however, aware of the risk of an upward 
ratchet in remuneration levels through over-reliance on comparative 
survey data. 
- The commercial environment is a demanding one and it is critical 
that incentives are in place for executives to be rewarded for 
the achievement of specific and measurable performance goals. 
Where these goals are not met it is also appropriate that this is 
recognised in a sharply reduced level of remuneration received. 
Accordingly, the annual bonus and long-term incentives make up a 
significant part of each executive Director's compensation package. 
- Incentive arrangements are structured so as to motivate participants 
to deliver high standards of performance, without encouraging 
excessive risk-taking. Managing risk is a critical issue for the 
Company, particularly in relation to the type of work the Group is 
engaged in and the need to ensure that in all of its systems and 
working practices, the highest safety standards are maintained. 
As a result, we take particular care to ensure that the targets 
and objectives which are set do not compromise that goal.  
- In rewarding performance, the emphasis should be on clear and 
verifiable  output' measures, in particular profit measured over 
annual and longer term performance periods. Other performance 
goals including those relating to social, environmental and 
governance responsibilities are assessed through the normal 
management review process. Overall, the RemCo maintains 
its commitment to performance measures which are objective, 
transparent and easy to understand so that they remain motivational 
to participants.  
- EPS and relative TSR remain the most appropriate  output' based 
measures of longer term performance. Executives should be 
motivated and rewarded in relation to the earnings performance 
of the Group. However, it is also appropriate that executives should 
be incentivised to achieve strong stock market performance to align 
their interests with those of shareholders. The continued use of 
EPS and TSR meets both these goals. The share-based elements of 
the package, including share ownership guidelines and the significant 
deferral of bonus in shares, drive performance over the longer term 
and align the interests of senior management with those of 
shareholders,  
- General pay trends in other parts of the Group are taken into account 
when setting the pay of the executive Directors. 
Basic salaries 
The policy is to set basic salaries at levels which are competitive given 
the size and complexity of the Company, as well as the broad business 
sectors in which it operates. To assist in market comparisons HNBS 
provides data and independent advice on remuneration levels in 
companies considered to be comparable in terms of revenue, market 
capitalisation and industry sector. The RemCo aims to position basic 
salaries around mid-market levels, taking into account the performance 
of the Group's business and individual Directors. 
The basic salaries for the executive Directors are reviewed annually 
on 1 July.  
At the review in 2010, Duncan Magrath's salary was increased from 
 360,000 to  385,000 and Andrew McNaughton's salary was increased 
from  385,000 to  410,000. These increases continue the process 
whereby the salaries for the more recent appointments to the Board 
are progressively aligned over time with the other executive Directors 
and the external market. The basic salaries of Ian Tyler, Anthony Rabin 
and Peter Zinkin were increased in line with the normal market 
movement at this level.

Annual report and accounts 2010 91
Annual incentive plan 
Each executive Director participates in an annual incentive plan, under 
which pre-determined financial targets must be achieved before any 
payment is earned. The maximum potential bonus which could have 
been earned by executive Directors for 2010 was 80% of basic salary 
and the performance indicator chosen was profit before tax, exceptional 
items and amortisation of intangible assets (profit ). A bonus of 40% 
of basic salary would have been earned for the achievement of 
performance in line with target. Two-thirds of any bonus achieved for 
2010 is payable in cash, whilst the remaining one-third is deferred in 
the form of ordinary shares in the Company under the Deferred Bonus 
Plan (the DBP ). These shares, along with shares awarded in lieu 
of dividends paid during the deferral period, will be released to the 
Directors after three years, providing they are still employed by the 
Company at that time. Bonuses are non-pensionable. The profit for 
the year ended 31 December 2010 resulted in a bonus of 55.7% 
of basic salary for each executive Director. Details are shown in the 
table on pages 94 and 95. 
Following the remuneration review carried out during the year, annual 
maximum bonus potential for executive Directors has been increased 
to 120% of basic salary for 2011. Target bonus continues to be set 
at 50% of the maximum potential with bonus targets continuing to 
be based purely on profit. The level of profit required to earn maximum 
bonus will continue to be a challenging goal without encouraging 
excessive risk-taking. In view of the increase in bonus potential, 
the amount of bonus deferral in the form of shares will increase from 
one-third to one-half of the bonus earned. 
Long-term incentive scheme 
During 2010, the final awards were made under the Performance Share 
Plan approved by shareholders at the 2006 AGM. Award levels were 
135% and 112.5% of salary for the Chief Executive and other executive 
Directors respectively. This was a reduction from the normal policy of 
150% and 125% of salary respectively. 
These awards are subject to two performance conditions, each applying 
to separate halves of the award and each measured over a period of 
three financial years. One half of the award is subject to an EPS growth 
range, requiring growth of RPI + 6% and RPI + 36% for between 25% 
and 100% of this part of the award to vest. The other half of the award 
is subject to a performance condition measuring the Company's total 
shareholder return compared to a comparator group of similar UK and 
overseas listed businesses. Details of outstanding awards and the 
performance conditions are contained later in this report under the table 
headed Directors' long-term incentives: the Performance Share Plan . 
Following consultation with the Company's major shareholders and 
representative bodies, shareholder approval will be sought at the 
2011 AGM for a new Performance Share Plan (new PSP) to replace 
the 2006 Performance Share Plan, which will have reached the end 
of its five-year life.  
Under the new PSP, awards will be made to executive Directors 
and other selected operational and functional senior managers. 
To enable total remuneration levels to move closer to mid-market 
levels, award levels for 2011 will be increased to 175% of salary 
for the Chief Executive and 150% of salary for the other executive 
Directors. The overall maximum award level of the new PSP is 
unchanged at 200% of salary.  
Performance conditions will be set for each award. For the 2011 
awards, the conditions will continue to be based on EPS and TSR 
performance. 
50% of an award will be linked to an adjusted EPS growth target, 
and will vest as shown in the table below.  
EPS growth over three years Proportion of award vesting 
Less than 15% Zero 
15% 25% 
45% 100% 
Between 15% and 45% 
Between 25% and 100%  
pro-rata 
For prior awards, EPS targets have used UK RPI as a benchmark, with 
a growth range above this benchmark to determine the level of vesting. 
Given the significant proportion of the Group's earnings that come from 
outside the UK, the link to a UK inflation measure is no longer thought 
appropriate, either as a relevant indicator of performance or as a 
measure that is meaningful to non-UK participants. Consequently, 
for the 2011 awards, the EPS performance link to UK RPI has been 
removed. The proposed range is considered to be appropriately 
stretching, providing a balance between a requirement for outstanding 
performance (particularly at the top end) whilst ensuring that undue  
risk-taking is not encouraged. The EPS target range will be reviewed 
carefully for each award. 
The performance condition attached to the other 50% of an award will 
be linked to the Company's TSR performance against a comparator 
group. For prior awards, TSR has been measured against a specific list 
of comparator companies drawn from the business sectors in which 
the Company operates. Given the changes to the scale and complexity 
of the Group's operations it is no longer thought possible to identify a 
sufficient number of equivalent companies. Consequently, for the 2011 
award, TSR performance will be assessed against UK listed companies 
ranked in the FTSE All Share Index between 51 to 150 (excluding 
Investments Trusts) on 31 December 2010. The choice of a FTSE 51 
to 150 comparator group reflects Balfour Beatty's FTSE ranking and 
the companies within this market cap range are (i) more international 
than the previous group (ii) more relevant from an investor perspective 
(iii) sufficiently numerous to reduce volatility caused by delistings. 
The RemCo believes that outperforming this group will represent 
a significant achievement in the current business climate. 
The TSR performance of all companies will be measured over the 
three-year performance period. This part of an award will vest in part 
if Balfour Beatty's TSR is equivalent to the company whose TSR 
performance is at the median, with full vesting if Balfour Beatty's 
TSR is equivalent to, or above, that of the company whose TSR 
performance is at the upper quartile. The scale of vesting is shown 
in the table below: 
Total shareholder return Proportion of award vesting 
Below median Zero 
Median 25% 
Upper quartile 100% 
Between median and upper quartile 
Between 25% and 100%  
pro-rata 
TSR and EPS performance will be independently verified and approved 
by the RemCo. 
The awards vest, subject to the achievement of performance 
conditions, three years after the date of grant, together with an 
additional award of shares in lieu of the value of dividends paid. 
EPS and TSR performance conditions continue to provide a good blend 
of performance metrics, with EPS growth rewarding strong financial 
performance and TSR rewarding stock market out-performance, which 
aligns strongly with shareholder interests.  OUR GOVERNANCE - REMUNERATION REPORT 
Balfour Beatty 92 
Clawback 
In line with best practice, a clawback provision has been incorporated 
into the annual incentive plan (including the deferred element) and the 
proposed new PSP.  
Remuneration and risk 
As part of the remuneration review, the RemCo also considered the 
relationship between remuneration and risk, and remains satisfied 
that the policies operated are appropriate and do not encourage undue 
risk-taking as: 
- total remuneration is appropriately balanced between fixed 
elements (e.g. basic salary and pension contribution) and incentive 
pay. Basic salary levels are targeted at around mid-market levels 
and are reviewed annually. Variable pay does not represent a 
disproportionately high level of overall remuneration; 
- annual bonuses are capped and targeted to ensure that performance 
incentives and rewards are set at an appropriate level; 
- a significant proportion of annual bonus is deferred in shares for three 
years, thereby providing a longer term performance horizon for the 
annual bonus; 
- PSP awards are granted annually, rather than on a one-off basis, 
meaning that no undue emphasis is placed on any one particular 
financial year-end;  
- sliding scale performance targets are used for all performance 
pay, providing incremental awards for additional performance 
delivered; and 
- the Company has introduced clawback provisions within the annual 
incentive plan (including the deferred element) and the proposed 
new PSP. 
Share ownership guidelines 
To further align the interests of senior management with those of 
shareholders, executive Directors and certain other senior managers are 
subject to share ownership guidelines. Executive Directors are required 
to accumulate a holding of ordinary shares in the Company to the value 
of 100% of their basic salary at a reference date, with other senior 
managers at 50% of basic salary. In order to achieve this, those subject 
to the share ownership guidelines, will be expected to retain at least 
half of the shares (after payment of any taxes due) which vest from 
awards made under the PSP and the DBP. 
Share options  
No grants of options have been made under the Executive Share 
Option Scheme (ESOS 2001) since 31 December 2004. The ESOS 
2001 expires in 2011 and it not proposed to renew the scheme.  
The Company operates an HMRC approved savings-related share 
option scheme (SAYE) under which Directors and employees are 
granted an option to purchase ordinary shares in the Company in either 
three or five years' time. This scheme is open to all employees based 
in the UK and is not subject to performance conditions. Employees 
normally have a period of six months after completion of the savings 
contributions during which to exercise the SAYE options, failing 
which they lapse.  
The SAYE reaches the end of its 10-year life in 2011 and the Company 
will be seeking approval from shareholders for a new SAYE scheme at 
the 2011 AGM. 
Share Incentive Plan  
The Company will also be seeking shareholder approval for an HMRC 
approved Share Incentive Plan (SIP) at the 2011 AGM. This will provide 
a further opportunity for employees to acquire shares in the Company. 
Pensions 
The Company provides pension benefits to UK employees principally 
through the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund (the Fund ), which has both 
defined benefit (DB ) and defined contribution (DC ) sections. The 
DB section provides for the build-up of pension benefits based on 
different accrual rates (as determined by job position) and has life cover, 
disability and spouse/dependants pension arrangements.  
A Fund-specific earnings cap has been maintained for those members 
who were previously subject to the HMRC earnings cap. This cap also 
applies to members of the DC section of the Fund. A discretionary cash 
supplement is paid in lieu of pension provision above the earnings cap. 
The Company is not compensating any member of the Fund (or any 
other pension scheme operated by the Company) for any additional 
tax which is payable as a result of changes to government policy.  
The specific pension arrangements for executive Directors are outlined 
in more detail in the Directors' pensions section on pages 98 and 99. 
The basic salary used for calculating DB benefits has been frozen with 
effect from January 2011.  
Service contracts 
It remains the Company's policy and practice to include in executive 
Directors' contracts a 12-months' rolling notice period from the 
Company and six-months' notice on the part of the Director. 
This policy will continue. 
Details of the service contracts of the executive Directors are shown 
in the table below.

Service contracts of executive Directors do not include provision for 
specific payment in the event of early termination, nor do they provide 
for extended notice periods or compensation in the event of a change 
of control. It is not the RemCo's intention to introduce such provisions. 
If any existing contract of employment is breached by the Company 
in the event of termination, the Company would be liable to pay, 
as damages, an amount approximating to the net loss of salary and 
contractual benefits for the unexpired notice period. The RemCo would 
seek to ensure that the Director fulfils his obligation to mitigate his 
losses and would also give consideration to phased payments where 
appropriate. In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
all Directors submit themselves for re-election at the AGM. 
External appointments 
The RemCo recognises that benefits can arise from allowing executive 
Directors to take a non-executive directorship elsewhere. With the 
approval of the Board in each case, executive Directors may therefore 
accept one external appointment and retain any related fees. Ian Tyler 
who resigned as a non-executive director of VT Group plc on 9 July 
2010, was appointed as a non-executive director of Cable & Wireless 
Communications plc, effective 1 January 2011. The fees received for 
his role at VT Group are set out in the notes to the Directors' 
remuneration table on pages 94 and 95.  Our governance | Chairman's introduction | Board of Directors | Directors' Report | Remuneration Report |

Non-executive Directors 
Non-executive Directors are appointed by the full Board following 
recommendations from the Nomination Committee. The Chairman's 
remuneration falls within the remit of the RemCo and is approved by 
the Board. The Board determines the terms on which the services 
of other non-executive Directors are provided. All non-executive 
Directors are appointed for a term of three years. In accordance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Directors submit themselves 
for re-election at the AGM. The non-executive Directors are not eligible 
to join any pension scheme operated by the Company and cannot 
participate in any of the Company's share option, annual incentive 
or long-term incentive schemes. None of the appointment letters 
for non-executive Directors contain provision for specific payment 
in the event of termination for whatever cause. 
The dates of the letters of appointment or re-appointment of the  
non-executive Directors are shown in the table below.

The fees of the non-executive Directors are reviewed from time 
to time with the last review having taken effect from 1 July 2010. 
The annual fee level for the non-executive Directors (excluding the 
Chairman) was increased from  48,000 to  52,000 and for Steve 
Marshall as Chairman from  240,000 to  250,000. The annual fee 
for chairing Board Committees was increased from  8,000 to  10,000. 
In addition, effective from 1 July 2010, an annual fee of  10,000 was 
introduced for the Senior Independent Director (SID ) in recognition 
of the additional responsibilities of that position. Where the SID is also 
the chairman of a Board Committee, as is the case with Robert Walvis, 
there is no additional fee. For non-executive Directors based outside 
Europe, an additional fee of  2,500 per visit to another country was 
introduced from 1 July 2010. 
During the year, the RemCo was chaired by Robert Walvis, the Audit 
Committee by Graham Roberts and the Business Practices Committee 
by Mike Donovan.  
An annual fee of  34,000 is payable to Hubertus Krossa for his 
chairmanship of the supervisory board of Balfour Beatty Rail GmbH.

As in previous reports, the RemCo has elected to compare the TSR on the Company's ordinary shares against the FTSE 250 Index (excluding 
investment trusts) principally because this is a broad index of which the Company is a constituent member. The values indicated in the graph 
show the share price growth plus reinvested dividends from a  100-hypothetical holding of ordinary shares in Balfour Beatty plc and in the index, 
at the start of the period and have been calculated using 30 trading-day average values.

Annual report and accounts 2010 95
Notes: 
(i) Basic salary and fees were those paid in respect of the period of the year during which individuals were Directors. In practice, the basic salary paid to Andrew McNaughton 
has been reduced due to his participation in the Company's SMART Pensions salary sacrifice arrangement. The  6,180 reduction in 2010 corresponds to his contributions 
to the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund, which are now met directly by the Company as part of this arrangement.  
(ii) Ian Tyler, Duncan Magrath, Andrew McNaughton and Anthony Rabin received taxable cash supplements in lieu of pension provision on their salary above the Balfour Beatty 
Pension Fund specific earnings cap. 
(iii) The performance target for annual bonus was profit before tax, exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets (profit ). The profit for the year ended 31 December 
2010 resulted in a bonus of 55.7% of basic salary for each executive Director. Two-thirds of this bonus is payable in cash and these are the amounts shown in the table above. 
The remaining one-third is deferred in the form of ordinary shares in the Company which will be released to the Director on 31 March 2014, providing he is still employed by 
the Company at that time. The number of shares comprising the deferred element will be determined based on the share price at the award date of 31 March 2011.  
(iv) Hubertus Krossa received a fee of  34,000 (included above) for his chairmanship of the supervisory board of Balfour Beatty Rail GmbH. 
(v)  In addition, Ian Tyler received a fee of  27,461 for his services as a non-executive director of VT Group plc. 
(vi) Benefits in kind are calculated in terms of UK taxable values. All executive Directors receive private medical insurance for the Director and his immediate family. Ian Tyler, 
Anthony Rabin and Peter Zinkin receive a fully expensed car and a fuel card. Duncan Magrath and Andrew McNaughton receive a car allowance of  14,000 p.a.  
(vii) No Director receives any expense allowance.  
(viii) Awards made under the Performance Share Plan in 2007 to Ian Tyler, Duncan Magrath, Andrew McNaughton, Anthony Rabin and Peter Zinkin vested during the year.

Notes: 
(i) All awards are granted for nil consideration and are in respect of 50p ordinary shares in Balfour Beatty plc. It is the Company's current intention that awards will be satisfied by 
shares purchased in the market. 
(ii) For the awards in April 2008, April 2009 and April 2010, the performance periods are the three years ending 31 December 2010, 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2012 
respectively. 50% of each award is subject to an EPS growth target. The maximum number of shares subject to this performance condition will only vest if EPS growth exceeds 
the retail prices index (RPI ) by 45% for the performance period for the April 2008 award, 39% for the April 2009 award and 36% for the April 2010 award. If EPS growth 
exceeds RPI by 15% for the April 2008 award, 9% for the April 2009 award and 6% for the April 2010 award, then 25% of this part of the awards will vest. For growth in EPS 
between these points, vesting will be on a pro-rata basis. No shares will vest from this part of the award if EPS growth exceeds RPI by less than 15%, 9% or 6% as appropriate. 
The other 50% of each award is subject to a total shareholder return (TSR ) target under which the TSR of the Company is compared to that of a comparator group of similar 
listed companies at the start of the performance period. The maximum number of shares subject to this performance condition will only vest if the Company's TSR is at the 
upper quartile of the comparator group. If the Company's TSR is equal to that of the median of the comparator group then 25% of this part of the award will vest. No shares from 
this part of the award will vest if the Company's TSR is below that of the median of the comparator group. For TSR performance between median and upper quartile, vesting will 
be on a pro-rata basis. There is no provision for re-testing of either of the performance conditions.  
(iii) The average middle market price of ordinary shares in the Company for the three dealing dates before the award dates, which was used for calculating the number of awards 
granted, was 491.583p for the 2007 award, 449.17p for the 2008 award, 354p for the 2009 award and 302.63p for the 2010 award. The closing middle market price of ordinary 
shares on the date of the awards was 490.75p, 450p, 352.25p and 302.8p respectively. 
(iv) The performance period for the awards made in April 2008 was completed on 31 December 2010. The growth in EPS for this period (with adjustments in relation to the rights 
issue for EPS in 2007 and PPP asset disposals and the acquisition of Parsons Brinckerhoff for EPS in 2010) exceeded RPI by 19.75%, exceeding the RPI + 15% required for 
threshold vesting. The Company's TSR for this period ranked just below the median of the comparator group. The combined effect of these performance measures is that 
18.4% of each participant's conditional award will vest on 15 April 2011. Each participant will also receive shares in lieu of the dividends which would have been payable on 
the shares which vest. 
(v) The performance period for the awards made in April 2007 was completed on 31 December 2009. The growth in EPS for this period (with adjustments in relation to the rights 
issue for EPS in 2006 and 2009 and for the acquisition of Parsons Brinckerhoff for EPS in 2009) exceeded RPI by more than 45%, the level required for maximum vesting. 
The Company's TSR for this period ranked just below the median of the comparator group. The combined effect of these performance measures is that 50% of each 
participant's conditional awards vested on 26 March 2010. This date was brought forward from the original vesting date of 17 April 2010. Ian Tyler, Duncan Magrath, Andrew 
McNaughton, Anthony Rabin and Peter Zinkin also received 9,347, 2,551, 3,990, 5,346 and 5,346 shares respectively in lieu of the dividends which would have been payable 
on the shares which vested. The closing middle market price of ordinary shares on the vesting date was 293.2p. The monetary values of the PSP award which vested in 2010 
are disclosed in Note (viii) to the Directors' remuneration table.  
(vi) On 15 April 2010 for all participants in the PSP, a maximum of 2,982,241 conditional shares were awarded which are normally exercisable in April 2013.  Our governance | Chairman's introduction | Board of Directors | Directors' Report | Remuneration Report |

Directors' pensions 
Executive Directors participate in the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund. The scheme provides for a pension at a normal retirement age of 62 for 
pension purposes and each Director pays an annual contribution equal to 5% of contributory salary except where, in the case of Andrew 
McNaughton, the Director participates in SMART Pensions as outlined in Note (ii) to the second table below. The pension for a Director who 
can complete 20 or more years' pensionable service at normal retirement age is targeted at two-thirds of final pensionable salary, subject 
to HMRC limits. With effect from 6 April 2006, HMRC limits were changed with one of the changes being to no longer use the earnings cap 
when determining the maximum permissible benefits. However, the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund has retained a Fund specific earnings cap 
for pension purposes. The salaries of Duncan Magrath, Andrew McNaughton, Anthony Rabin and Ian Tyler were subject to the Fund specific 
earnings cap for pension purposes and details of the Company's contributions to additional arrangements for them are noted underneath the 
second table below.   Our governance | Chairman's introduction | Board of Directors | Directors' Report | Remuneration Report |
 
Annual report and accounts 2010 99
The table below sets out the accrued deferred pension which would be paid annually from the scheme at normal retirement age based on each 
executive Director's service to 31 December 2010 as well as the additional pension benefit secured in respect of service during the year.

Notes: 
(i) The increases in accrued deferred pension during the year due to inflation are negative. This is because inflation is measured using the Retail Prices Index which decreased 
between September 2008 and September 2009 (the period used to determine inflationary increases applying during the year).  
(ii) The transfer value of the increase in accrued deferred pension is the present value of the increase in excess of inflation in the deferred pension and associated benefits during 
the period in accordance with the transfer value regulations, less the Director's contributions.  
(iii) Anthony Rabin's pensionable service includes nine years of transferred-in service from previous pension arrangements. 
(iv) On 1 January 2011, Peter Zinkin started to receive his pension benefits from the Defined Benefit section of the Fund, and became a contributing member of the Defined 
Contribution section. The impact of this change will be incorporated in the 2011 Remuneration Report.  
 
The table below sets out the transfer value at 31 December 2010 of each executive Director's accrued deferred pension at that date as well 
as the movement in that transfer value over the period. The transfer values represent the cash equivalent values that would have been payable 
from the scheme had the Directors left service on the dates shown, and reflect the age of the Director, his period of membership of the scheme 
and his pensionable salary.

Notes: 
(i) The transfer value is the present value of the accrued deferred pension and associated benefits at the relevant date, calculated using the transfer value basis then in force. 
(ii) Andrew McNaughton has participated in the Company's SMART Pensions salary sacrifice arrangement since 1 November 2009. Mr McNaughton's contributions figure includes 
 6,180 paid via this arrangement.  
(iii) The figure is the difference between the transfer value of the accrued benefits at the start and end of the period, less the Director's contributions during the period.  
(iv) Anthony Rabin's pensionable service includes nine years of transferred-in service from previous pension arrangements.
