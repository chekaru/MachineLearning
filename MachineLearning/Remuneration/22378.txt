Remuneration Report
Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committee's report for 2012 on Directors' remuneration.
The Government has recently tabled proposals to reform the way that Directors' remuneration is voted upon and 
reported. Although the new legislative requirements will not come into effect until October 2013, the Committee 
has sought to comply with many of the new requirements in the interests of openness and transparency. 
Accordingly we have split this report into two sections: 
 a Policy Report which sets out the forward looking policy on the remuneration of the executive and  
non-executive Directors for 2013
 an Implementation Report which discloses how the current remuneration policy has been implemented in the year 
ended 31 December 2012.
We will be seeking your support for both parts of the report by way of a single advisory vote at the forthcoming AGM.
The Group continues to face challenging trading conditions in many of its traditional construction markets and is taking 
action to improve operational performance and effectiveness. Underlying pre-tax profit from continuing operations, 
which is the measure on which we base performance for the Annual Incentive Plan (AIP), decreased 7% to  310 million 
in 2012, including the benefit of  52 million of gains from PPP disposals. The Group's financial performance for 2012 has 
therefore generated outturns from the AIP for the executive Directors of 48% of base salary, which is below target and 
significantly lower than the 78% of base salary for the previous year. Furthermore, the 2010 Performance Share Plan 
awards will lapse in full in April 2013 as the 2009 Performance Share Plan awards did in April 2012. We believe that this 
represents a fair link between reward and performance for the year under review.
We remain committed to ensuring that rewards for executives are closely aligned to the interests of shareholders 
through having all of our incentive arrangements linked to the achievement of challenging business performance 
targets and generation of market beating levels of shareholder return. We remain comfortable that this is the case.
We are not proposing any major changes to the remuneration policy for the 2013 financial year, although the suite 
of performance metrics used in the Annual Incentive Plan and Performance Share Plan will change for 2013. More 
specifically, 30% of the annual incentive will be subject to three business strategy metrics (with 70% continuing to be 
subject to profit before tax). Furthermore the earnings per share performance condition attaching to the Performance 
Share Plan awards will be removed and replaced with an additional relative total shareholder return condition. Further 
details of these changes, which have been made following shareholder consultation, are contained in the Policy Report.
Salaries of executive Directors are due to be reviewed in July 2013 but it has already been agreed that, consistent 
with many parts of the Group, executive Directors will not receive an annual increase in 2013.
The Committee encourages dialogue with the Company's shareholders and will consult with major shareholders ahead 
of any significant future changes to remuneration policy. We were pleased that the 2011 Remuneration Report received 
a 97% vote in favour at the 2012 AGM. 
Shareholders are invited to approve this report at the AGM on 16 May 2013.

Policy Report
This part of the Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy for the Company with effect from 1 January 2013. There have 
been some changes to the performance metrics used in the performance related elements of pay, which the Committee considers 
provide better alignment with the business strategy. Further details of these changes are provided on pages 84 and 85.
The Committee, on behalf of the Board, determines the remuneration packages of the executive Directors of the Company and the 
Chairman and the Company's remuneration policy. In setting the remuneration policy, the Committee takes into account a number 
of factors, including:
 general trends in pay and conditions throughout the Group
 the positioning of remuneration levels against the external market - the Committee is, however, aware of the risk of an upward 
ratchet in remuneration levels through overreliance on comparative survey data
 the balance between fixed and variable pay - more specifically, variable pay should form a significant but not disproportionately 
high level of remuneration
 the strategy of the business.
In setting the overall remuneration policy, general trends and average increases throughout the Group are taken into account when 
setting executive Directors' reward packages. A key feature for the executive Directors is that a higher proportion of their remuneration 
package is delivered through performance related pay, which has a greater linkage to the results of the Group. The areas covered in this 
Policy Report comprise:

Executive Director remuneration policy for 2013
The following table sets out a summary of each element of the executive Directors' remuneration packages, their link to the  
Company's strategy, the policy for how these are operated, the maximum opportunity, a description of any performance  
metrics and any changes since 2012. 
Element of pay Purpose and link to Company's strategy How operated in practice
Base salary To attract and retain high calibre individuals.
To provide a mid-market salary relative to 
comparable companies in terms of size 
and complexity.
Salaries are reviewed and set annually in July.
The Committee considers remuneration levels in 
companies of comparable market capitalisations, 
revenues and industry sectors.
In addition, a key reference point for salary increases is the 
average increase across the general workforce (with the 
exception of promotions or significant changes in responsibility). 
Salaries are paid monthly in cash.
Benefits To aid retention and to remain competitive in the 
marketplace. In addition, medical benefits are 
provided to minimise disruption due to absence.
Private medical insurance. 
A car and fuel card or car allowance are offered.
Pension To remain competitive in the marketplace. Executive Directors can elect to either: 
 participate in the defined contribution (DC) section of the 
Group's pension fund. Executive Directors must make 
contributions of 5% of base salary (up to an earnings cap), 
with the Company contributing 20% of base salary (up to the 
cap). On earnings above the cap, executive Directors receive 
a salary supplement; or
 receive a salary supplement. 
Annual Incentive Plan 
(AIP) and Deferred Bonus  
Plan (DBP)
To motivate executives and incentivise the 
achievement of key business performance  
targets over the financial year without  
encouraging excessive risk taking. Managing risk  
is critical, particularly given the nature of the 
Company's business.
To facilitate share ownership and provide further 
alignment with shareholders.
50% of the annual incentive is paid in cash annually and 50% 
is deferred into shares for three years.
Clawback may apply in the event of material misconduct  
and/or material misstatement or error of financial results.
Performance Share Plan  
(PSP)
To incentivise and reward delivery of long term 
performance linked to the business strategy.
To facilitate share ownership and provide further 
alignment with shareholders.
To aid retention.
PSP awards are granted annually so that no undue emphasis 
is placed on performance in any one particular financial year. 
Awards vest on the third anniversary subject to performance 
over three financial years. 
Participants also receive an award of shares in lieu of the value 
of dividends on vested shares.
Clawback may apply in the event of material misconduct  
and/or material misstatement or error of financial results.
For 2013, the relative total shareholder return (TSR) performance 
metric is considered to be the most appropriate output based 
measure of longer term performance. Executive Directors should 
be incentivised to achieve strong stock market performance to 
align their interests with those of shareholders. 
Shareholding guidelines To further align the interests of executive Directors 
with those of shareholders.
Executive Directors are expected to accumulate a shareholding 
in the Company's shares to the value of 100% of their base 
salary. Executive Directors are expected to retain at least 50% 
of shares (net of tax) which vest from awards made under the 
PSP and DBP until the target shareholding is attained.
Fees for external  
appointments
The Committee recognises that benefits can arise 
from allowing executive Directors to take a 
non-executive directorship elsewhere.
Fees can be retained with the approval of the Board.
New joiners The above policy would also be anticipated to form the basis on which any new executive Director would be appointed.  
Ongoing policy for the individual would be subject to the above policy. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2012 85

Our Governance | Remuneration Report
Maximum opportunity Description of performance metrics Changes since 2012
- The Committee takes into account the performance of the 
Group and each individual executive Director's performance 
when setting salaries.
No change
The maximum opportunity for medical 
benefits is cover for the executive 
Director and his family. The taxable 
value of the car and fuel card can vary 
depending on the car provided and tax 
rates from time to time. The value of 
car allowance is:
  16,000 for the Chief Executive
  14,000 for other executive 
Directors.
-No change
Executive Directors who participate 
in the Group's pension fund receive 
a salary supplement of 20% of base 
salary in excess of the cap. 
If a salary supplement alone is 
taken, this is equivalent to 20% 
of base salary.
- During 2012 some executive Directors 
participated in the defined benefit (DB) 
section of the Group's pension fund. 
Further details are set out on page 94.
Maximum annual incentive 
opportunity is 120% of base salary.
70% of the bonus is based on profit before tax and 
non-underlying items. 30% of the bonus is based on 
three other Group-based performance metrics linked 
to the business strategy.
The metrics are based on:
 delivery of cost efficiencies
 strength of order book
 restructuring for strategic growth.
Other performance goals including those relating to social, 
environmental and governance responsibilities are assessed 
through the normal management review process.
Three new Group based performance 
metrics have been introduced for 2013 (for 
30% of the bonus opportunity) to provide 
a link between reward and the strategic 
changes required during 2013. The new 
measures are designed to provide a more 
rounded assessment of performance.
The payout for achieving on-target 
performance under the profit before tax part 
of the bonus has been reduced from 50% to 
40% of the maximum bonus opportunity.
The limit in the rules of the PSP is 
200% of base salary. Other than 
in exceptional circumstances, the 
value of shares at grant is equal to:
 175% of base salary for the 
Chief Executive
 150% of base salary for 
other executive Directors.
100% of the awards are subject to relative TSR targets 
measured over a period of three years.
50% of awards are based on TSR against a comparator 
group of UK listed companies ranked 51-150 by market 
capitalisation in the FTSE All Share Index (excluding 
Investment Trusts) at the start of the performance period.
50% of awards are based on TSR measured against a group 
of 8-10 construction and professional services companies, 
including international peers.
For both tranches there is no vesting below median, with 
25% vesting at median ranking, rising to 100% vesting at 
upper quartile or higher.
A sliding scale for performance targets is used to provide 
incremental awards for additional performance delivered, 
but with a cap in place to discourage excessive risk taking. 
The earnings per share element of the PSP 
award (accounting for 50% of awards in 
2012) has been removed due to the 
difficulties in setting robust targets given the 
ongoing uncertainty in construction markets.
The Remuneration Committee considers 
relative TSR to be a good measure of the 
Group's performance. In addition, the choice 
of the two comparator groups will reward 
executives for outperforming the sector and/
or the general market, although significant 
rewards will only be delivered for 
outperforming both.
- No change No change
Maximum of one external 
corporate appointment.
-No change
However, flexibility is retained to offer remuneration on a one-off basis on appointment outside the above policy.   Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2012 86

Remuneration scenarios for executive Directors
The charts below provide estimates for the potential future remuneration based on the remuneration policy for 2013. Potential 
outcomes based on different performance scenarios are provided for the Chief Executive (assuming a full year's remuneration for 
the incoming Chief Executive) and the Chief Financial Officer. The remuneration package of the Chief Financial Officer is similar in 
proportion terms to that of the Planning and Development Director. The charts show that the performance related elements of the 
package comprise a very significant proportion of the executive Directors' total remuneration from threshold performance upwards, 
with payments for on-target and maximum performance linked to highly stretching business goals.

Performance graph comparing the Company's TSR with the FTSE 250 and the Chief Executive's remuneration
As in previous reports, the Remuneration Committee has chosen to compare the TSR on the Company's ordinary shares against the 
FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) principally because this is a broad index of which the Company is a constituent member. 
The values indicated in the graph show the share price growth plus reinvested dividends from a  100 hypothetical holding of ordinary 
shares in Balfour Beatty plc and in the index, and have been calculated using 30 trading day average values.
In addition, the graph shows the movements in remuneration earned by the Chief Executive for each year over the same period.

Directors' base salaries in 2012
At the annual review of base salaries for the executive Directors on 1 July 2012, base salaries were reviewed as shown below:
Name of Director
Base salary at 
1 July 2012
Base salary at 
1 July 2011 % uplift
Duncan Magrath (Note i)  425,000  405,000 4.9%
Andrew McNaughton (Note ii)  460,000  430,000 7.0%
Anthony Rabin n/a  450,000 n/a
Ian Tyler (Note iii)  688,000  668,000 3.0%
Peter Zinkin (Note iii)  443,000  430,000 3.0%
Notes:
(i)  The 4.9% increase was based on market and performance factors.
(ii)  The 7.0% increase was based on market and performance factors plus an element for the additional responsibilities taken on as a result of Andrew McNaughton's 
additional appointment as Deputy Chief Executive.
(iii) The 3.0% increase was based on market and performance factors.
As part of the overall succession plan, the Board has recently announced some changes to the management team. The Chief 
Executive, Ian Tyler, is leaving the Company in April 2013 and Andrew McNaughton will be succeeding him as Chief Executive, 
effective from 31 March 2013. In addition, our Deputy Chief Executive, Anthony Rabin, retired from the Company on 30 June 2012.
Andrew McNaughton's base salary will be  650,000 on appointment, with other elements of his package in line with the policy set out 
in this report.
In line with contractual entitlements, Ian Tyler will work four months of his 12 months' notice period, up to 30 April 2013, to ensure a 
smooth handover to Andrew McNaughton. In lieu of the remainder of the notice period, he will receive a payment from the Company 
equivalent to eight months' salary, benefits and pension, including phased monthly payments for the four months from September to 
December 2013, which are subject to offset against earnings elsewhere. Ian Tyler will be treated as a good leaver under the relevant 
share plans. On 30 April 2013, his awards under the Deferred Bonus Plan will vest and a proportion of his Performance Share Plan 
(PSP) awards will lapse reflecting the proportion of the performance period for each award which had not been completed at that date. 
The remainder of his PSP awards will vest in the same proportion, and at the same time, as the awards made to the other participants.
At the annual review of fees for the non-executive Directors on 1 July 2012 the annual fee level for the non-executive Directors 
(excluding the Chairman) was increased from  54,000 to  56,000 and for Steve Marshall as Chairman from  258,000 to  265,750. 
The annual fee for chairing Board Committees is unchanged at  10,000. In addition the annual fee for the Senior Independent Director 
remains at  10,000. For non-executive Directors based outside Europe the additional allowance for each overseas visit made on 
Company business remains at  2,500. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2012 90

Notes:
(i)  Base salary and fees were those paid in respect of the period of the year during which individuals were Directors. In practice, the base salary paid to Peter Zinkin has 
been reduced due to his participation in the Company's SMART Pensions salary sacrifice arrangement. The salary reduction in 2012 was  6,773. This corresponds to 
his contributions to the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund, which are now met directly by the Company as part of this arrangement.
(ii)  The base salaries paid to Duncan Magrath, Andrew McNaughton and Peter Zinkin have been reduced due to their participation in the Company's Share Incentive Plan. 
The salary reductions in 2012 were  2,625,  1,125 and  2,625 for Duncan Magrath, Andrew McNaughton and Peter Zinkin respectively.
(iii)  All executive Directors received taxable cash supplements in lieu of some pension provision. Further details are set out in the section on Directors' pensions on pages 94 
and 95.
(iv)  The performance measure for the AIP was profit before tax and non-underlying items. The targets were set in January 2012 based on a sliding scale from threshold to 
target profit and from target profit to maximum. The profit for the year ended 31 December 2012 resulted in an AIP outturn of 48.2% of base salary for each executive 
Director. As Ian Tyler is leaving the business on 30 April 2013, all of his annual incentive will be paid in cash and this amount is shown in the table above. For the other 
executive Directors, 50% of this annual incentive is payable in cash and these are the amounts shown in the table above. The remaining 50% is deferred in the form 
of ordinary shares in the Company. The number of shares comprising the deferred element will be determined based on the share price at the award date of 29 March 
2013. These shares will be released to the Director on 29 March 2016, providing he is still employed by the Company at that time.
(v)  Hubertus Krossa received a fee of  30,000 (included above) for his chairmanship of the supervisory board of Balfour Beatty Rail GmbH.
(vi)  In addition, Ian Tyler received a fee of  76,667 for his services as a non-executive director of Cable & Wireless Communications Plc, Duncan Magrath received a fee 
of  27,000 for his services as a non-executive director of Brammer plc and Anthony Rabin received a fee of  35,625 for his services as a non-executive director of 
Colt Group S.A.
(vii)  Taxable benefits are calculated in terms of UK taxable values. All executive Directors received private medical insurance for the Director and his immediate family. 
Ian Tyler and Anthony Rabin received a fully expensed car and a fuel card. Peter Zinkin received a fully expensed car only. Duncan Magrath and Andrew McNaughton 
received a car allowance of  14,000 pa.
(viii) No Director received any expense allowance.
(ix)   In addition, awards made under the Deferred Bonus Plan in 2009 to Duncan Magrath, Andrew McNaughton, Anthony Rabin, Ian Tyler and Peter Zinkin vested during the 
year. At the date of vesting on 31 March 2012 the closing market price was 285.5p and the total values of the awards which vested were  93,067,  83,492,  116,341, 
 172,468 and  110,871 respectively.
(x)  In addition, Ian Tyler and Peter Zinkin exercised savings-related share options during the year. The closing market price on the dates of exercise were 312.7p and 300.6p

Directors' interests in the Annual Incentive Plan in 2012
As detailed in the Policy Report, each executive Director participates in the Annual Incentive Plan, in which performance is measured 
over a single financial year. For the year under review, the performance condition which applied to the Annual Incentive Plan and the 
resulting outturn were as follows:
Performance measure
Proportion of total annual 
incentive available
Resulting annual 
incentive outturn (Note i)
% of maximum % of base salary % of maximum % of base salary
Profit before tax and  
non-underlying items
Threshold:  287m 6.25% 7.5%
Actual:  309.8m
(Note ii)
40.2% 48.2%
Target:  319m 50% 60%
Maximum:  367m 100% 120%
Notes:
(i)  As Ian Tyler is leaving the business on 30 April 2013, all of his AIP outturn will be paid in cash. For the other executive Directors, 50% of the AIP outturn will be payable  
in cash, whilst the remaining 50% will be deferred into shares under the Deferred Bonus Plan.
(ii) As set out in the rules of the AIP the Committee adjusts the profit before tax figure for acquisitions, divestments and exchange rate movements. The adjusted profit  
 before tax figure used for the year ended 31 December 2012 was  311.8m. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2012 92

Notes:
(i)  All awards are granted for nil consideration and are in respect of 50p ordinary shares in Balfour Beatty plc. It is the Company's current intention that awards will be 
satisfied by shares purchased in the market.
(ii)  For the awards in April 2010, June 2011 and April 2012 the performance periods are the three years ending 31 December 2012, 31 December 2013 and 31 December 
2014 respectively. 50% of each award is subject to an earnings per share (EPS) growth target. The maximum number of shares subject to this performance condition will 
only vest if EPS growth exceeds the retail prices index (RPI) by 36% for the April 2010 award and if EPS growth exceeds 45% for the June 2011 and April 2012 awards. 
If EPS growth exceeds RPI by 6% for the April 2010 award and if EPS growth exceeds 15% for the June 2011 and April 2012 awards, 25% of this part of the awards will 
vest. For growth in EPS between these points, vesting will be on a pro rata basis. No shares will vest from this part of the award if EPS growth exceeds RPI by less than 
6% for the April 2010 awards or if EPS growth is less than 15% for the June 2011 and April 2012 awards. The other 50% of each award is subject to a total shareholder 
return (TSR) target under which the TSR of the Company is compared to a comparator group at the start of the performance period. For the 2010 award, the comparator 
group was based on a bespoke group of companies (as previously disclosed). For the 2011 and 2012 awards, the comparator group was the FTSE 51-150 (excluding 
investment trusts). The maximum number of shares subject to this performance condition will only vest if the Company's TSR is in the upper quartile of the comparator 
group. If the Company's TSR is equal to that of the median of the comparator group, 25% of this part of the award will vest. No shares from this part of the award will 
vest if the Company's TSR is below that of the median of the comparator group. For TSR performance between median and upper quartile, vesting will be on a pro rata 
basis. There is no provision for retesting of either of the performance conditions. 
(iii)  The average middle market price of ordinary shares in the Company for the three dealing dates before the award dates, which was used for calculating the number of 
awards granted, was 354p for the 2009 award, 302.63p for the 2010 award, 317.78p for the 2011 award and 277.3p for the 2012 award. The closing middle market price 
of ordinary shares on the date of the awards was 352.25p, 302.8p, 312.4p and 271.9p respectively.
(iv)   Anthony Rabin retired from the Company on 30 June 2012. At this time a proportion of his 2010 and 2011 awards lapsed reflecting the proportion of the performance 
period for each award which had not been completed at the date of retirement. The remainder of these awards will vest in the same proportion, and at the same time 
in 2013 and 2014 respectively, as the awards made to the other participants.
(v)  On 16 April 2012 for all participants in the PSP, a maximum of 4,177,096 conditional shares were awarded which are normally exercisable in April 2015. 
(vi)  The performance period for the awards made in April 2009 was completed on 31 December 2011. The growth in EPS for this period did not exceed the RPI + 9%  
required for threshold vesting. The Company's TSR for this period ranked below the median of the comparator group. The combined effect of these performance 
measures is that each participant's conditional award lapsed on 15 April 2012.
(vii)  The performance period for the awards made in April 2010 was completed on 31 December 2012. The growth in EPS for this period did not exceed the RPI + 6% 
required for threshold vesting. The Company's TSR for this period ranked below the median of the comparator group. The combined effect of these performance 
measures is that each participant's conditional award will lapse on 15 April 2013. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2012 93

Directors' pensions and pension allowances in 2012
Executive Directors participated in the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund (the Fund) during 2012. The defined benefit (DB) section of the 
Fund provides for a pension at a normal retirement age of 62 for pension purposes. The defined contribution (DC) section of the Fund 
is a money purchase scheme with a normal retirement age of 65. Each Director pays an annual contribution equal to 5% of contributory 
salary except where the Director participates in the Company's SMART Pensions salary sacrifice arrangement as outlined in Note (i) 
in the Directors' remuneration table on page 90.
The DB pension for a Director who can complete 20 or more years of pensionable service at normal retirement age is targeted at 
two-thirds of final pensionable salary, subject to Fund limits which have their origin in the former HMRC limits.
The Fund operates a Fund-specific earnings cap for pension purposes. The pensionable earnings of each Director were subject to 
the Fund-specific earnings cap and details of the Company's allowances paid in lieu of pension contributions on earnings above the 
Fund-specific earnings cap are included in the Directors' remuneration table on page 90. Andrew McNaughton elected to have his 
pensionable earnings restricted further to a personal earnings cap and details of the Company's allowance paid in lieu of pension 
contributions on earnings above his personal earnings cap are included in the Directors' remuneration table on page 90. 
Duncan Magrath opted out of the DB section of the Fund on 5 April 2012 and became a deferred pensioner. He chose not to participate 
in the DC section of the Fund and has been receiving an allowance in lieu of Fund membership since 6 April 2012.
Andrew McNaughton opted out of the Fund on 31 December 2012. He chose not to participate in the DC section of the Fund and has 
been receiving an allowance in lieu of Fund membership since 31 December 2012.
Anthony Rabin retired from the Company on 30 June 2012 and started to receive his DB pension immediately.
Peter Zinkin opted out of the DB section of the Fund on 31 December 2010 and started to receive his DB pension from 1 January 2011. 
He has not accrued any further DB pension in the Fund during 2012. He has however participated in the DC section of the Fund since 
1 January 2011, and the Company's contributions to this arrangement for 2012 are shown in Note (vii) on page 95.
Pension table 1 below sets out the accrued DB deferred pension which would be paid annually from the Fund at normal retirement 
age based on each executive Director's service to 31 December 2012 (or earlier date of leaving the Fund) as well as showing the 
increase in DB pension benefit secured in respect of service during the year.
Pension table 2 below sets out the transfer value at 31 December 2012 of each executive Director's accrued DB pension entitlements 
at that date as well as the movement in that transfer value over the period. The transfer values represent the cash equivalent values 
that would have been payable from the Fund had the Directors left service on the dates shown (except where noted below), and reflect 
each executive Director's age and DB benefit entitlement.

Directors' pensions and pension allowances in 2012 continued
Notes to Pension tables 1 and 2 on page 94:
(i)  These amounts represent the value at 31 December 2012 of the increase in excess of inflation (where inflation is measured using the RPI between September 2010 
and September 2011) of each Director's deferred pension and associated benefits over the period calculated in accordance with the transfer value regulations, using the 
transfer value basis then stipulated by the Trustee of the Fund, less the value of any Directors' contributions. 
(ii)  These amounts represent the present value of the accrued deferred pension and associated benefits at 31 December 2011 for all Directors who were in pensionable 
service at this date, calculated using the transfer value basis then stipulated by the Trustee of the Fund. For Peter Zinkin, who was not in pensionable service at 
31 December 2011, see individual comments below. 
(iii)  These amounts represent the difference between the transfer value of each Directors' accrued benefits at the end and the beginning of the year, less the value of any 
Directors' contributions paid during the year.
(iv)  These amounts represent the present value of the accrued deferred pension and associated benefits at 31 December 2012 for all Directors who were in pensionable 
service at this date, calculated using the transfer value basis then stipulated by the Trustee of the Fund. For Directors who were not in pensionable service at 
31 December 2012, Duncan Magrath, Anthony Rabin and Peter Zinkin, see individual comments below.
(v)  Duncan Magrath ceased accruing a DB pension through the Fund on 5 April 2012 and became a deferred pensioner. He has not accrued any benefits in the Fund since 
5 April 2012. The period of pensionable service shown for Duncan Magrath is for the period up to 5 April 2012. The accrued deferred pension figure as at 31 December 
2012 in Pension table 1 is his deferred pension on leaving the Fund as at 5 April 2012. The increase in his accrued pension up until 5 April 2012 was less than the annual 
inflationary increase to his accrued pension as at 31 December 2011, so using market conditions as at 31 December 2012 this represented a reduction in value of  6,367.
