 I am pleased to present the 
Remuneration Committee's 
report for 2013 on Directors' 
remuneration.
This report will be subject to two 
shareholder votes at the forthcoming AGM:
 	 the Directors' Remuneration Policy 
Report sets out the forward looking 
Directors' remuneration policy for 
the Company which will, subject to 
shareholder approval, become formally 
effective from the 2014 AGM
 	 the Annual Report on Remuneration 
provides details of how the policy 
for 2014 will be operated and the 
remuneration earned by Directors  
in the year ended 31 December 2013.
s ummary of major decisions made 
in 2013
Following consultation with major 
shareholders and representative bodies, 
the remuneration policy for 2013 was 
adjusted to take account of a number 
of factors, notably the appointment of 
Andrew McNaughton replacing Ian Tyler 
as Chief Executive in March 2013 and the 
challenges in a number of our markets, 
especially in UK construction, which have 
required, in the immediate term, an urgent 
drive and focus on operational efficiency 
and rigorous cost control measures. While 
not reflecting a significant divergence 
from the Company's existing policy, 
the following changes were considered 
to be important: 
 	 instead of basing the entire Annual 
Incentive Plan (AIP) on profit before tax 
and non-underlying items (PBT), in view 
of the strategic challenges facing the 
business, strategic measures linked  
to the repositioning of the business  
for future growth were introduced. 
Accordingly, for 2013, PBT was retained 
for 70% of the bonus opportunity (albeit 
the payout range was toughened) with 
the remaining 30% determined by 
strategic targets based around the 
strength of the order intake, a cost 
reduction programme and the 
development of the organisational 
structure
 	 instead of the Company's traditional 
approach of measuring 50% of any 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) award 
based on EPS growth targets and 
50% based on relative TSR against 
the FTSE 51-150, recognising the 
difficulties in determining meaningful 
EPS targets in a period of transition and 
structural change, the 2013 PSP awards 
were based solely on relative TSR 
performance. 50% of an award is based 
on the current FTSE 51-150 companies 
and 50% is based on a construction and 
professional services based group of 
companies, including international peers
 	 in addition to the normal 150% of salary 
PSP award level, Duncan Magrath 
received a 50% of salary PSP award  
in April 2013. While his normal award  
of 150% of salary is based on the  
same performance targets as the 
awards granted to the other executive 
Directors, the additional award is based 
on personally tailored targets covering 
Group capital structure and the 
execution of the strategic planning 
(Strategic Roadmap) process, measured 
over a 15 month period to June 2014. 
The additional award will vest, subject 
to the achievement of the performance 
targets and continued service, on 
31 December 2014 although these 
shares must be retained by Mr Magrath 
until the vesting date of the normal  
PSP awards (ie April 2016). 
Performance and reward for 2013
The Group has continued to face 
challenging trading conditions in many 
of its traditional construction markets  
and is taking action to improve operational 
performance and effectiveness. Underlying 
PBT from continuing operations, which  
is the measure on which we based 
performance for 70% of AIP, was below 
threshold, meaning that no bonus was 
payable under the PBT element. The 
Group however made progress against 
strategic initiatives in 2013, resulting in a 
21.0% payout against the 30% strategic 
element. In the light of disappointing 
financial performance the Executive 
Directors decided that all of their cash 
bonus entitlement, which was earned  
for achievement of strategic initiatives, 
should be deferred in shares for three 
years. The EPS and TSR performance 
conditions relating to the 2011 
Performance Share Plan were not 
achieved and so those awards will lapse 
in full in April 2014. 
Remuneration policy for 2014
We remain committed to ensuring that 
rewards for executives are closely aligned 
to the interests of shareholders through 
having all of our incentive arrangements 
linked to the achievement of challenging 
business performance targets and 
generation of strong levels of shareholder 
return. We remain comfortable that this 
is the case. As such, we feel that the 
existing remuneration policy remains 
fit for purpose and are not proposing 
to make any significant changes to the 
policy for 2014. Specifically:
 	 base salary remains appropriately 
positioned against the market. Base 
salaries were not increased with  
effect from 1 July 2013
 	 the structure of the annual bonus 
remains appropriate to incentivise  
the delivery of annual objectives. The 
maximum bonus opportunity remains  
at 120% of salary for all executive 
Directors and will be subject to a range 
of challenging PBT and strategic targets
 	 the long term incentive awards under 
the PSP will again be based on TSR 
versus the FTSE 51-150 and a group 
of construction and professional 
services companies, providing 
strong alignment of interest between 
executives and shareholders.
The Committee encourages dialogue 
with the Company's shareholders and 
will consult with major shareholders 
ahead of any significant future changes 
to remuneration policy, although it is 
intended that the policy for which 
shareholder approval will be sought at 
the 2014 AGM will remain in operation 
for the forthcoming three financial years. 
I hope that you will be supportive of the 
two resolutions to approve the Directors' 
Remuneration Report at the 2014 AGM.

This part of the Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy for the Company which will become formally effective following 
approval from shareholders through a binding vote at the 2014 AGM.
Policy overview
The Committee, on behalf of the Board, determines the Company's remuneration policy and the remuneration packages of the 
executive Directors of the Company and the Chairman. In setting the remuneration policy, the Committee takes into account a  
number of factors, including:
 	 general trends in pay and conditions throughout the Group
 	 the positioning of remuneration levels against the external market - the Committee is, however, aware of the risk of an upward 
ratchet in remuneration levels through overreliance on comparative survey data
 	 the balance between fixed and variable pay - more specifically, variable pay should form a significant but not disproportionately  
high level of remuneration
 	 the strategy of the business.
In setting the overall remuneration policy, general trends and average increases throughout the Group are taken into account  
when setting executive Directors' reward packages. A key feature for the executive Directors is that a higher proportion of their  
remuneration package is delivered through performance related pay, which has a greater linkage to the results of the Group.  
The areas covered in this Policy Report comprise:
 Consideration of shareholders' views p69
 Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group p69
 Summary Directors' remuneration policy from the 2014 AGM onwards p70 and p71
 Remuneration scenarios for executive Directors p72 
 Recruitment and promotion policy for executive Directors p72 
 Service agreements and payments for loss of office for executive Directors p73
 External appointments of executive Directors p73
 Appointment of non-executive Directors p73
 
Consideration of shareholders' views
The Remuneration Committee considers feedback from shareholders received at each AGM and any feedback from additional 
meetings, as part of any review of executive remuneration. In addition, the Remuneration Committee engages pro-actively with 
shareholders and will ensure that shareholders are consulted in advance, where any material changes to the remuneration policy  
are proposed.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
In determining the remuneration of the Group's Directors, the Committee takes into account the general trends in pay and conditions 
across the Group as a whole. Whilst employees have not been consulted formally on executive pay, due in part to the diverse 
geographic nature of the Company, the Committee seeks to ensure that the underlying principles which form the basis for decisions 
on Directors' pay are consistent with those on which pay decisions for the rest of the workforce are taken. These are focused for  
the most part on market competitiveness, business performance and personal performance.
In practice, the remuneration policy for executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay than for other employees,  
so that a significant proportion of their remuneration is dependent on Company performance. For employees below Board level 
variable pay represents a lower proportion of their total remuneration, which is driven by market comparators and general performance.

element of pay Purpose and link to Company's strategy how operated in practice Maximum opportunity Performance metrics
Base salary To attract and retain high calibre individuals.
To provide a competitive salary relative to comparable 
companies in terms of size and complexity.
Salaries are normally reviewed and set annually in July. 
The Committee considers remuneration levels in 
companies of comparable market capitalisations,  
revenue and industry sector.
In addition, a key reference point for salary increases 
is the average increase across the general workforce 
(with the exception of promotions or significant changes 
in responsibility). 
Salaries are paid monthly in cash.
There is no prescribed maximum annual increase. The Committee is 
guided by the general increase for the broader employee population 
but on occasion may need to recognise, for example, an increase 
in the scale, scope or responsibility of the role.
Current salary levels are disclosed on page 75. 
A number of factors are considered, notably market competitiveness, 
business and personal performance.
Benefits To aid retention and to remain competitive in the 
marketplace. In addition, medical benefits are 
provided to minimise disruption due to absence.
Private medical and life assurance may be provided. 
A car and fuel card or car allowance are offered.
Other benefits may be provided as appropriate.
The maximum opportunity for medical benefits is cover for the 
executive Director and his family. Life assurance cover and any car 
or car allowance are based on market norms.
None
Pension To remain competitive in the marketplace. Executive Directors can elect to either: 
 	 participate in the defined contribution (DC) section of 
the Group's pension fund. Executive Directors must 
make contributions of 5% of base salary (up to an 
earnings cap), with the Company contributing 20% of 
base salary (up to the cap). On earnings above the cap, 
executive Directors receive a salary supplement; or
 	 receive a salary supplement. 
Executive Directors who participate in the Group's pension fund 
benefit from a pension contribution of 20% of base salary up to the 
earnings cap and a salary supplement of 20% of base salary in 
excess of the cap. 
If a salary supplement alone is taken, this is equivalent to 20% 
of base salary.
None
Annual Incentive Plan 
(AIP) and Deferred 
Bonus Plan (DBP)
To motivate executives and incentivise the 
achievement of key business performance targets 
over the financial year without encouraging excessive 
risk taking. Managing risk is critical, particularly given 
the nature of the Company's business.
To facilitate share ownership and provide further 
alignment with shareholders.
50% of any payment is normally deferred into shares  
for three years.
Clawback may apply in the event of material misconduct 
and/or material misstatement or error of financial results.
Participants may also receive an award of cash or shares 
in lieu of the value of dividends on vested shares.
Maximum annual incentive opportunity is 120% of base salary. A majority (if not all) of the bonus will be based on profit and a minority 
of the bonus may be based on other performance metrics linked to the 
business strategy, measured over a one year performance period.
Measures are reviewed each year and varied as appropriate to reflect 
the strategy.
Performance s hare Plan 
(Ps P)
To incentivise and reward delivery of long term 
performance linked to the business strategy.
To facilitate share ownership and provide further 
alignment with shareholders.
To aid retention.
PSP awards are granted annually so that no undue 
emphasis is placed on performance in any one particular 
financial year. 
Awards normally vest on the third anniversary subject 
to performance. 
Participants may also receive an award of cash or shares 
in lieu of the value of dividends on vested shares.
Clawback may apply in the event of material misconduct 
and/or material misstatement or error of financial results.
The limit in the rules of the PSP is 200% of base salary. Other  
than in exceptional circumstances, the normal limit will be 175%  
of base salary.
Performance measures will normally be based on relative total 
shareholder return (TSR) and/or earnings per share metrics although 
strategic measures may be used in exceptional circumstances. Targets 
will normally be measured over a three year performance period.
There is 25% vesting for threshold performance, rising to 100% vesting 
for maximum performance.
s hareholding guidelines To align the interests of executive Directors with 
those of shareholders.
Executive Directors are expected to accumulate a 
shareholding in the Company's shares to the value  
of 100% of their base salary. Executive Directors are 
expected to retain at least 50% of shares (net of tax)  
which vest from awards made under the PSP and DBP 
until the target shareholding is attained.
- None
Notes: 
1. Directors may also participate in the all-employee share schemes up to prevailing HMRC Limits.
2.   The AIP is primarily, if not solely, based on PBT although other Group-based measures which are set to reflect the business strategy may be included. The Remuneration 
Committee reviews these measures each year and varies them as appropriate to reflect the strategy for the year ahead.
3.  Relative TSR performance was considered to be the most appropriate long term incentive performance condition for awards granted in 2013, although earnings per share 
targets determined half of previous awards and may be operated going forward. Executive Directors should be incentivised to achieve strong stock market performance 
and grow earnings, to align their interests with those of shareholders. The Committee reserves the discretion to introduce additional internal financial or strategic measures 
for future awards which will be set to reflect the prevailing strategy although investors will be consulted in advance where there is a material change.
4.  The Committee operates share plans in accordance with the respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC where relevant. The Committee, 
consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of certain plans.
5.  For avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors' Remuneration Policy Report, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current 
or former Directors (such as the vesting of past share awards).

Notes:
1. Salary levels are based on those applying from 1 July 2013.
2.  The value of benefits receivable in 2014 is taken to be the value of benefits received in 2013 (as shown in the Directors Remuneration table, set out on page 76)  
and pension has been assumed to be worth 20% of salary.
3.  The on-target level of AIP is taken to be 50% of the maximum AIP opportunity (120% of salary for all executive Directors), of which 50% is paid in cash and 50% is 
deferred in shares under the DBP. 
4.  The on-target level of vesting under the PSP is taken to be 50% of the face value of the award at grant (under normal circumstances, 175% of salary for the Chief Executive 
and 150% of salary for the other executive Directors).
5.  The maximum level of AIP and vesting under the PSP is taken to be 100% of the AIP opportunity and 100% of the face value of the award at grant respectively.
6.  No share price appreciation or dividend awards have been assumed for the DBP shares and PSP awards.
Recruitment and promotion policy for executive Directors
To ensure the ongoing leadership continuity of the Group, the appointment of high calibre executives may be necessary, either by 
external appointment or internal promotion. The remuneration package for a new executive Director would be set in accordance with 
the terms of the Company's remuneration policy at the time of appointment and take into account the scope and complexity of the 
role, the experience of the individual, the prevailing market rate for that experience and the importance and immediacy of securing  
that candidate.
The salary would be provided at such a level as required to attract the most appropriate candidate. The AIP potential would be limited 
to 120% of salary and grants under the PSP may be up to the plan maximum of 200% of salary. In addition, the Committee may offer 
additional cash and/or share-based elements to replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an executive leaving a previous employer. 
It would seek to ensure, where possible, that these awards would be consistent with awards forfeited in terms of vesting periods, 
expected value and performance conditions. 
For an internal executive Director appointment, any remuneration awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out 
according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration 
obligations existing prior to appointment may continue. 
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and/or incidental 
expenses as appropriate.

72 s ervice agreements and payments for loss of office for executive Directors
It is the Company's policy that executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term, which are subject to one year's notice 
by the Company and six months' notice by the Director. In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all executive Directors 
submit themselves for re-election at the AGM. In the event of early termination, the Directors' contracts provide for compensation  
in line with their contractual notice period. In summary, the contractual provisions are to provide the following: 
Provision Detailed terms
Notice period 12 months by the Company, six months by the Director.
There are no contractual compensation provisions for termination of employment. However, other non-contractual considerations  
are as follows:
Notice payments If any existing contract is breached by the Company, it would be liable to pay an 
amount approximating to the net loss of salary and contractual benefits for the 
unexpired notice period, subject to mitigation and phased payments where 
appropriate.
Remuneration entitlements Pro rata bonus may also become payable for the period of active service along with 
vesting for outstanding share awards (in certain circumstances - see below).
In all cases performance targets would apply.
Change of control No executive Director's contract contains additional provisions in respect of change  
of control.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive Director under the Company's share plans will be determined based on the 
relevant plan rules. The default treatment under the PSP is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment. However, 
in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill-health, disability, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the 
Committee, good leaver status may be applied. For good leavers, awards will not be forfeited on cessation of employment and subject 
to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions, will vest under the normal vesting schedule, being reduced pro rata to 
reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served. However, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine 
that PSP awards vest at cessation and/or to amend time pro rating. Outstanding DBP awards will lapse on cessation of employment. 
However, in certain good leaver circumstances, DBP awards will vest in full on the date of cessation.
external appointments of executive Directors
The Committee recognises that benefits can arise from allowing executive Directors to take a non-executive directorship elsewhere. 
Executive Directors are permitted to have one external appointment, from which fees may be retained with the approval of the Board.
Appointment of non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors are appointed by the full Board following recommendations from the Nomination Committee. All non-executive 
Directors are appointed for a term of three years. In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all non-executive Directors 
submit themselves for re-election at the AGM.

Director fees
To attract and retain high

non-executive Directors.
The Chairman is paid an annual fee and the 
non-executive Directors are paid an annual base 
fee and additional responsibility fees for the role 
of Senior Independent Director or for chairing  
a Board Committee.
Non-executive Directors based outside Europe 
receive an additional allowance for each visit 
made on Company business to the UK, or to any 
other country (excluding their home country). 
Fee levels are normally reviewed annually in July.
The non-executive Directors are not eligible to join 
any pension scheme operated by the Company 
and cannot participate in any of the Company's 
share plans or annual incentive schemes. 
As per executive Directors, there  
is no prescribed maximum annual 
increase. The Committee is guided 
by the general increase in the 
non-executive director market  
and for the broader employee 
population, but on occasions may 
need to recognise, for example,  
an increase in the scale, scope  
or responsibility of the role.
None of the appointment letters for non-executive Directors contain provision for specific payment in the event of termination for 
whatever cause and may be terminated at will by either party.

The detailed information about the Directors' remuneration, set out on pages 75 to 80 (excluding the performance graph on page 80), 
has been audited by the Company's independent auditors Deloitte LLP.
Base salaries
Current base salaries for the executive Directors are as follows:

Andrew McNaughton's base salary was increased effective from 31 March 2013 on his promotion to Chief Executive.
The annual base salary review date is 1 July for executive Directors.
Performance targets for the AIP in 2014 
For 2014, the AIP will continue to be based on PBT (70% of the AIP potential) and Group-based measures linked to the business 
strategy (30% of the AIP potential). The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the performance targets for the 
forthcoming year as these include items which the Committee considers commercially sensitive. Retrospective disclosure of the 
targets and performance against them will be seen in next year's Annual Report on Remuneration. 
The maximum AIP potential will continue to be 120% of base salary for executive Directors and 50% of any payment will be deferred 
in shares for three years.
Performance targets for PSP awards granted in 2014 
The PSP awards to be granted in 2014 will be subject to the following targets:
 	 relative TSR (50%) - the Company's TSR measured against a comparator group of UK listed companies ranked 51-150 by market 
capitalisation in the FTSE All Share Index (excluding investment trusts) as at 1 January 2014, the start of the performance period
 	 relative TSR (50%) - the Company's TSR measured against a comparator group of construction and professional services 
companies, including international peers
 	 for both parts there is no vesting below median, with 25% vesting at median ranking, rising to 100% vesting at upper quartile or 
higher. Opening and closing values used to calculate TSR for all companies are based on three month averages.
Non-executive Directors
As detailed in the Policy Report, the Company's approach to setting non-executive Directors' fees is by reference to fees paid at similar 
companies and reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of each role. A summary of current fees is as follows:
1 July 2012
 
1 j uly 2013
  % increase
Chairman 265,750 265,750 0%
Base fee 56,000 56,000 0%
Senior Independent Director fee 10,000 10,000 0%
Committee chair fee 10,000 10,000 0%
For non-executive Directors based outside Europe the additional allowance for each overseas visit made on Company business 
remains at  2,500.
Where the Chairman or Senior Independent Director is also the Committee chair, only the Chairman or Senior Independent Director  
fee is due.

  Base salary and fees were those paid in respect of the period of the year during which the individuals were Directors.

  In practice the base salaries paid to Duncan Magrath, Andrew McNaughton and Peter Zinkin have been reduced due to their participation in the Company's Share Incentive 
Plan. The salary reductions in 2013 were  1,500 for all three executive Directors. In practice the base salary paid to Peter Zinkin has been further reduced due to his 
participation in the Company's SMART Pensions salary sacrifice arrangement. The salary reduction in 2013 was  7,005. This corresponds to his contributions to the 
Balfour Beatty Pension Fund, which were met directly by the Company as part of this arrangement. The base salary for Peter Zinkin has also been reduced in practice  
by  24,000 in 2013 to meet additional travelling costs incurred by him in order to fulfil his role.
3
  Taxable benefits are calculated in terms of UK taxable values. Duncan Magrath, Andrew McNaughton and Ian Tyler received private medical insurance for the Director and

on earnings that are above the earnings cap. For periods of membership of the defined benefit (DB section of the Group's pension fund this comprises the value of any 
ongoing accrual as determined by the scheme actuaries plus any cash allowances in lieu of pension on earnings that are above the earnings cap. For any periods of 
non-membership of the Group's pension fund this comprises any cash allowances in lieu of pension contributions. For periods of deferred membership of the DB section 
of the Group's pension fund there may also be included the value of any increase in DB benefits as determined by the scheme actuaries. Further details are set out in the 
section on Directors' pensions on pages 82 and 83. The figures for 2012 have been restated to comply with new regulations.

Performance targets for the additional 50% of salary award granted to Duncan Magrath were (i) to review the Group's capital structure and implement changes as 
appropriate, and (ii) to lead the strategic planning (Strategic Roadmap) process in 2013 and implement improvements in 2014.
Payments for loss of office
In line with contractual entitlements, Ian Tyler worked four months of his 12 months' notice period, up to 30 April 2013 (after retiring 
from the Board on 31 March 2013), to ensure a smooth handover to Andrew McNaughton. In April 2013 Ian Tyler received his base 
salary of  57,333 and continued to receive his taxable benefits. He also accrued an additional month's entitlement under the PSP.  
In lieu of the remainder of the notice period, he received a payment of  265,360 from the Company equivalent to four months' base 
salary and benefits (for pension treatment see page 82) and phased monthly payments of  66,340 for each of the four months from 
September to December 2013, which would have been subject to an offset against any remuneration earned in a comparable role 
during this period. He also continued to receive private medical insurance for himself and his immediate family until 31 December 2013. 
As disclosed in the 2012 Remuneration Report, Ian Tyler has been treated as a good leaver under the relevant share plans.  
On 30 April 2013, his outstanding DBP awards vested in full and a proportion of his PSP awards lapsed reflecting the proportion  
of the performance period for each award which had not been completed at that date. The remainder of his PSP awards will vest 
subject to performance in the same proportion, and at the same time, as the awards made to the other participants.
Payments to past Directors
There were no payments to past Directors other than the payments disclosed in this report for Ian Tyler.

Performance graph 
As in previous reports, the Remuneration Committee has chosen to compare the TSR on the Company's ordinary shares against the 
FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) principally because this is a broad index of which the Company is a constituent member. 
The values indicated in the graph show the share price growth plus reinvested dividends from a  100 hypothetical holding of ordinary 
shares in Balfour Beatty plc and in the index, and have been calculated using 30 trading day average values.

the Company's SMART Pensions salary sacrifice arrangement as outlined in Note 2 in the Directors' remuneration table on page 76.
The Fund operates a Fund-specific earnings cap for pension purposes. The pensionable earnings of each participating Director were 
subject to the Fund-specific earnings cap. The Company paid allowances to Peter Zinkin and Ian Tyler in lieu of pension contributions 
on earnings above the Fund-specific earnings cap, which are included in the Directors' remuneration table on page 76. 
Duncan Magrath opted out of the DB section of the Fund on 5 April 2012 and became a deferred pensioner. In accordance with the 
Fund rules his deferred pension was revalued in the year in line with price inflation (measured by the Retail Prices Index). He chose

  These amounts represent each Director's accrued DB deferred pension at the relevant date. In accordance with the Fund Rules accrued DB deferred pension in excess of 
Guaranteed Minimum Pension has been increased in line with the Retail Prices Index between each Director's date of becoming a deferred pensioner of the Fund and the 
relevant date.
2
   These amounts represent the value of the increase in excess of inflation (where inflation is measured as the annual increase in the Consumer Prices Index to the 
September before the relevant date) of the accrued DB deferred pension over the period, less Director contributions. The increase in benefits has been calculated using 
HMRC methodology and then multiplied by a factor of 20. The figures for Peter Zinkin represent the contributions paid over the period by the Company into the DC section 
of the Fund excluding any SMART Pensions salary sacrifice amounts.
3
  The accrued DB deferred pension figures shown for Duncan Magrath include his DB benefits in the Fund purchased with Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs).  
In May 2013 the Fund paid an Annual Allowance tax charge of  27,249 to HMRC on Duncan Magrath's behalf in a  Scheme Pays' arrangement. The value of this tax charge 
has been recorded as a negative DC contribution in respect of Duncan Magrath and will be rolled up to the Director's retirement date, at which point it will be used to 
reduce the level of DB pension to which he is entitled from the Fund. The pensions table above makes no allowance for Duncan Magrath's Scheme Pays arrangement.
 
4
  Peter Zinkin has not accrued any DB benefits in the Fund since 31 December 2010. Peter Zinkin has participated in the DC section since 1 January 2011, and the Company 
paid  28,020 into this arrangement during 2013, in addition to his SMART Pensions salary sacrifice of  7,005.
5
  Ian Tyler has not accrued any benefits in the Fund since 30 April 2013. Immediately prior to him becoming a deferred pensioner of the Fund, the Company contributed 
 40,420 towards augmenting his accrued deferred pension. Ian Tyler's accrued DB deferred pension at 30 April 2013 included this augmentation of  2,391 pa.  
In May 2013 the Fund paid an Annual Allowance tax charge of  3,950 to HMRC on Ian Tyler's behalf in a  Scheme Pays' arrangement. The value of this tax charge 
has been recorded as a negative DC contribution in respect of Ian Tyler and will be rolled up to the Director's retirement date, at which point it will be used to reduce 
the level of DB pension to which he is entitled from the Fund. The pensions table above makes no allowance for Ian Tyler's  Scheme Pays' arrangement.

83 external appointments of executive Directors
During 2013 Duncan Magrath acted as a non-executive Director of Brammer plc and received fees of  37,000 which he retained.
Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors' remuneration
The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent non-executive Directors, as defined under the Corporate Governance 
Code. No member of the Committee has conflicts of interest arising from cross directorships and no member is involved in the 
day-to-day executive management of the Group. During the year under review, the members of the Committee were as follows:
 	 Iain Ferguson (Committee chair)
 	 Maureen Kempston Darkes (from 13 September 2013)
 	 Hubertus Krossa (retired from the Board on 16 May 2013)
 	 Steve Marshall
 	 Graham Roberts.
The Committee also receives advice from several sources, namely:
 	 the Chief Executive and the HR director, who are invited to attend meetings of the Committee but are not present when matters 
relating directly to their own remuneration are discussed
 	 New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon plc), (NBS).
NBS has been appointed as external independent executive remuneration advisers by the Committee and has provided a range 
of advice to the Committee during the year, including:
 	 provision of pay benchmarking data for the executive Directors and non-executive Directors
 	 annual update for the Committee on developments in best practice, market experience and regulatory requirements for all 
remuneration elements
 	 assistance with the drafting of the Remuneration Report
 	 valuation of share-based payments for IFRS 2 purposes
 	 calculation of vesting levels under the TSR element of the PSP awards.
Neither NBS nor any part of Aon plc provided any other services to the Company during the year under review. Total fees paid to NBS 
in respect of its services to the Remuneration Committee were  55,798.
NBS is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants' Code of Conduct. The Committee is satisfied that the advice that it receives from 
NBS is objective and independent.
s tatement of shareholder voting at AGM 
At the 2013 AGM, the Remuneration Report received the following votes from shareholders
Total number of votes % of votes cast
For 303,759,518 75.21%
Against 100,110,156 24.79%
Total votes cast 403,869,674 100%
Abstentions 42,527,882
The Committee has reflected on the significantly lower vote in favour of the Remuneration Report at the AGM in 2013, which it 
concluded could be attributed largely to investors' concerns around the financial performance of the Group, following the operational 
issues in Construction Services UK, rather than specific issues with the remuneration policy, which had only recently been reviewed 
by major shareholders.
