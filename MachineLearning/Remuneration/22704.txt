Remuneration Report
The members of the Remuneration Committee, throughout the year, were Mr A E Kilburn (Chairman), and Mr P H Ashworth.
Mr M Pescod was appointed to the Committee on 11th October 2001 and Mr C G Toner on 13th June 2002.
The Committee has the responsibility to consider and make recommendations to the Board with regard to executive directors'
remuneration. In doing so, the Committee has given full consideration to Section B of the Combined Code annexed to the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
The policy is to ensure that remuneration packages are sufficient to attract, motivate and retain executive directors of a high
calibre. Consideration is given to the Group's performance compared with other companies in the construction sector and of total
remuneration packages in those companies to ensure that total remuneration packages are comparable.
The basic salary for each executive director is reviewed annually taking into account the results achieved by the Group. Annual
performance related payments are made, based upon Group pre-tax profit levels. The executive directors also participate in a
deferred bonus scheme based upon the achievement of a challenging performance target, set by the Remuneration Committee, over
a 5 year period ending 30th June 2003. In addition to the amounts shown below, the sum of  0.4m (2001  0.3m) was charged to
the profit and loss account in respect of further provisional amounts that may be awarded at the discretion of the Remuneration
Committee at the end of that period.
The executive directors receive taxable benefits in kind covering the provision of a motor vehicle, private medical insurance
and some telephone costs.
All executive directors have one year rolling contracts. There are no specific provisions for compensation on early termination.
The non-executive directors' remuneration and terms of appointment are established by a committee consisting of the executive
directors.
The executive directors proposed for re-election at the forthcoming annual general meeting are Mr D A Pretty and Mr H
Walker, both of whom have service contracts requiring 12 months notice. Mr P H Ashworth and Mr C G Toner, the non-executive
directors proposed for re-election at the forthcoming annual general meeting, have terms of appointment for one year expiring on
the 17th November 2002 and on the 14th May 2003 respectively.
All executive directors are members of the Group's contributory defined benefit pension scheme which entitles them, with the
exception of Mr G K Hester and Mr D A Pretty, to a pension on retirement of two thirds of final pensionable salary after 40 years
membership. The executive directors are also eligible for dependants' pension and insured lump sums on death in service. The final
pension is calculated from the highest yearly average pensionable salary over three consecutive years during the last ten years of
service. The entitlements of Mr G K Hester and Mr D A Pretty are restricted by the earnings cap imposed under the Finance Act
1989. Performance related pay has always been and continues to be an integral part of pensionable salary to provide a competitive
and appropriate remuneration package for directors. Benefits in kind are not pensionable. 
The Group's original Executive Share Option Scheme expired on its 10th anniversary in December 1996. In November 1997 the
company adopted an Executive Share Option Plan (the Plan). The Remuneration Committee approves the grant of share options to
executive directors under the Plan, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group. Options
are normally exercisable between 3 and 10 years from the date of grant. The exercise of the options granted under the Plan are
subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Committee, namely that the growth in the earnings
per share of the company over a period of three consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by
at least 6 per cent for those options granted in 1997 and 1998, increased to 9 per cent for those granted in 1999, 2000 and in 2001.
