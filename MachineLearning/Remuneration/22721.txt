 I n t ro d u c t i o n
This year's remuneration r e p o rt is presented for the first time to shareholders in accordance with the r e q u i rements of the
D i rectors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the Regulations).  In preparing the r e p o rt in the new format the Remuneration
Committee has reviewed remuneration policy for executive directors and in so doing has r e a ff i rmed its commitment to ensure that
overall remuneration continues to be linked to organisational and individual per f o rmance and has a clear alignment with the intere s t s
of shar e h o l d e r s .
The r e p o rt also includes details of a new Long-T e rm Per f o rmance Plan for executive directors, which will be put to shar e h o l d e r s
at the AGM and awards will be made ther e a f t e r.  If approved, the Plan will replace the deferred bonus scheme for executive dir e c t o r s
established in 1998, awards in respect of which vested at the year ended 30th June 2003.
Remuneration Committee
The Committee operates within terms of r e f e rence and governance policies approved by the Board and is responsible on behalf
of the Board for:
  d e t e rmining the service conditions and remuneration of all executive dir e c t o r s ;
  executive remuneration policy;
  the evaluation of executive director per f o rmance with r e g a rd to the award of share options, deferred bonus and other per f o rm a n c e
based r e m u n e r a t i o n ;
  obtaining independent professional advice in relation to executive director r e m u n e r a t i o n .
During the year under review the Remuneration Committee has met on five occasions.
Membership and Proceedings of the Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee are all non-executive directors and during the year have comprised Mr A E
K i l b u rn (Chairman), Mr  C G T o n e r, Mr M Pescod and Mr P H Ashworth.  All Committee members other than Mr P H Ashwor t h
a re considered to be wholly independent with no financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the Committee's decisions.  The
G roup Chief Executive attends meetings of the Committee as r e q u i red but he is not present when matters affecting his own
remuneration are considered.  Having r e g a rd to current corporate governance expectations in relation to the independence of
Remuneration Committee Members, Mr P H Ashworth has now stood down from membership of the Remuneration Committee.
Other than as expressly identified in this r e p o rt the Remuneration Committee has complied with the Combined Code on
Corporate Governance.  The Committee recognises its accountability on executive remuneration to shareholders through this r e p o rt
and in determining future remuneration policy it will consider both the shareholders' vote on the r e p o rt and views expressed by
s h a reholders on the detail of the r e p o rt .
A d v i c e
Advice is provided to the Remuneration Committee by the Company Secr e t a ry, Mr L Dent, a practising solicitor.  Mr Dent also
acts as secr e t a ry to the Committee.  In addition, Watson Wyatt LLP were appointed by the Committee to advise on a range of issues,
including the current market positioning of the Gr o u p 's executive remuneration having r e g a rd to a comparator group of eleven other
leading housebuilding companies.  They have also advised in relation to the str u c t u re of the proposed Long-T e rm Per f o rmance Plan
to replace the deferred bonus scheme.
M e rcer Human Resource Consulting Limited has advised the Company in relation to various pensions issues and, with ef f e c t
f rom 10th July 2003, were appointed to provide actuarial services to the Barratt Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
Slaughter and May, the Gr o u p 's principal legal advisors, advised the company in relation to the establishment and operation of
the company's current executive and employee share schemes. They have also advised the Remuneration Committee in relation to
the rules governing the operation of the Long-T e rm Per f o rmance Plan.
Remuneration Policy
This r e p o rt details the company's remuneration policy both for 2003/04, and so far as practicable, for subsequent years.  Any
changes made to the policy will be identified in subsequent Remuneration Reports to shareholders.  Central to the Gr o u p
remuneration policy is a recognition that the sustained growth and profitability of our business is determined in no short measure by
the skill and commitment of the executive team.  The r e w a rd policy for executive directors seeks to provide remuneration and other
s e rvice conditions which will attract, retain, motivate and r e w a rd executive directors of the highest calibre within the industr y 's
highly competitive employment market.  Within these broad objectives the executive remuneration package is based on the
following principles:
  the greater part of remuneration paid to executives should be linked to the achievement of demanding per f o rmance tar g e t s ;
  p e rf o rmance related remuneration should align the interests of executives with those of shareholders by setting per f o rm a n c e
t a rgets based on measures of shareholder r e t u rn ;
Remuneration Report
2 9   total remuneration for outstanding per f o rmance should be competitive with that available elsewhere in the sector;
  executive director remuneration should be determined with due consideration to the r e w a rds and conditions of all Gr o u p
employees, particularly in relation to the annual review of basic salary.
The Remuneration Package for Executive Dir e c t o r s
The remuneration package for executive directors comprises:
  basic salar y ;
  annual profit related bonus;
  d e f e rred bonus scheme (to be replaced in 2003 with a Long-T e rm Per f o rmance Plan);
  s h a re option scheme;
  pension and other benefits.
Typically the per f o rmance related element of executive remuneration makes up more than 50% of the total package excluding
pension benefits. The per f o rmance conditions which apply to the per f o rmance related element of executive remuneration are the
same for all executive directors and are set out in the following sections of this r e p o rt .
Basic Salary
Basic salaries for executive directors are a fixed annual sum payable monthly in cash.  Salaries are set having r e g a rd to individual
responsibilities, skills and experience and are currently based on the market median for similar positions in large national
housebuilding companies.  Salaries are reviewed each year by the Remuneration Committee and the following were set with ef f e c t
f rom 1st July 2003:
   
D A Pr e t t y 400,400 (Appointed Chief Executive 18th October 2002) (2002 : 230,000)
H W a l k e r 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 (2002 : 230,000)
S J Boyes 2 2 0 , 0 0 0 (2002 : 180,000)
C A Dearlove 2 2 5 , 0 0 0 (2002 : 216,000)

P R Gier o n 2 3 9 , 0 0 0 (2002 : 230,000)
G K Hester 2 3 9 , 0 0 0 (2002 : 220,000)
Annual Profit Related Bonus
Each executive director also participates in an annual profit related bonus scheme based on the annual level of the Gr o u p 's pr e -
tax profit with awards made at 0.133% of the Group pre-tax profit for the Group Chief Executive and 0.1% for all other executive
d i rectors.  A similar annual bonus scheme is operated for senior management in all Group Regions and Divisions based on a
p e rcentage of pre-tax profit for each Region and Division.
The Remuneration Committee proposes to review the annual profit related bonus scheme so that for 2004/05 and future years
t h e re is a minimum level of profit that needs to be achieved before payouts begin.  This has not been an issue for the business given
its sustained profit growth over the last 11 years.  The Committee considers it essential however that there should be clarity as to
bonus entitlement should minimum profit targets not be achieved for whatever reason in the future.  
S h a re Option Schemes
The Gr o u p 's original Executive Share Option Scheme expired on its 10th anniversary in December 1996.  In November 1997
the Company adopted the current Executive Share Option Plan (the Plan).  The grant of share options under the Plan is at the
d i s c retion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual per f o rmance and the overall per f o rmance of the Gr o u p .
Options must be held for a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exer c i s e d
within ten years.  The exercise of the options granted under the Plan is subject to the achievement of an objective per f o rm a n c e
condition set by the Remuneration Committee namely that the growth in the earnings per share of the Company over a period of
t h ree consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 6% for options granted in 1997 and
1998 and by at least 9% for those options granted in and since 1999.  
D e f e rred Bonus Scheme
The current deferred bonus scheme was established by the Board in 1998.  It was a five year plan which ended on 30th June 2003
with any awards vesting at that date.  The plan was established with a view to the delivery of a stretching per f o rmance target which
was to double shareholder funds from  399.4m to over  800m on 30th June 2003 by increasing retained profit by over  400.6m in
that same period.  The maximum bonus award subject to achievement of the per f o rmance target is 0.005% of Group net profits during
the per f o rmance period for executive directors and 0.0066% for the Group Chief Executive, pro rata to his period of office from 18th
October 2002 to 30th June 2003.  50% of the bonus vests on attainment of the per f o rmance target and the remaining 50% vests at
the discretion of the Remuneration Committee having r e g a rd to individual and organisational per f o rmance.  With retained pr o f i t s
i n c reasing by  512.5m the per f o rmance target has been exceeded by  111.9m and, having r e g a rd to the outstanding overall
p e rf o rmance of all Regions of the business in the last five years, the Remuneration Committee has exercised its discretion to award
the 50% discr e t i o n a ry element of the bonus in full. Deferred bonus payments will be made to the Executive Directors as follows:

Pension Benefits
All executive directors are members of the Gr o u p 's defined benefit pension scheme, which is now closed to new entrants.  The
scheme entitles the executive directors with the exception of Mr D A Pr e t t y, Mr G K Hester and Mr C Fenton to a pension on
re t i rement at age 65 of two thirds of final pensionable salary after 40 years membership of the scheme.   The executive directors are
also eligible for dependents pension and an insured lump sum of four times pensionable salary on death in service.  The final pension
is calculated from the highest yearly average pensionable salary over three consecutive years during the last ten years of ser v i c e .
The entitlements of Mr D A Pr e t t y, Mr G K Hester and Mr C Fenton are restricted by the earnings cap imposed under the
Finance Act 1989.  Under a contractual arrangement entered into in 1992 Mr D A Pr e t t y 's pension accrues at the rate of 1/30th of
the earnings cap.  
As r e p o rted to shareholders in previous remuneration r e p o rts, annual profit related bonus is included in the calculation of final
pensionable salary, for executive directors.  The Remuneration Committee recognises that for executive directors the inclusion of
p rofit related bonus in the calculation of final pensionable salary r e q u i res explanation under the Combined Code of Corporate
G o v e rnance.  In this r e g a rd the inclusion of profit related bonus in the calculation of pensionable salary is a contractual ar r a n g e m e n t
which pre-dates the introduction of the Combined Code.  Fur t h e rm o re, it is an arrangement which applies equally to all Gr o u p
management and staff as well as to executive directors.  The Committee is also mindful that apart from the funding of Mr Pr e t t y 's
pension at 1/30th of the earnings cap, no pension enhancements are of f e red to Group executive directors whereas such executive
pension enhancements are commonplace elsewhere in the sector.
The Remuneration Committee considers that until such time as the Inland Revenue's pending proposals for the introduction of
a lifetime limit on pensions (currently anticipated at  1.4m with effect from April 2005) are finalised it would not be appropriate to
implement any material changes to the str u c t u re of executive pensions.  It is anticipated that all executive directors other than those
whose pensions are already capped will be in excess of the proposed new Inland Revenue limits based on benefits earned to date.  The
pension entitlements for all executive directors will ther e f o re be reviewed once final details of the Inland Revenue proposals are
k n o w n .
S e rvice Contracts
All executive directors are engaged on identical terms on the basis of one year rolling contracts which can be terminated by 12
months notice given by the Company or by 12 months notice given by the executive at any time.  There are no specific pr o v i s i o n s
for compensation on early termination.  The contracts entitle executive directors to the provision of a Company car and membership
of a private health care scheme.

Remuneration Report
3 2 Total Shareholder Return Performance Graph 
The following graph pr e p a red in accordance to the Regulations shows the Company Total Shareholder Return per f o rmance over
the last five years against the FTSE Construction and Building Materials Sector Index. The Board has chosen this comparator index
as the Group is a constituent of the index along with its major competitors and it is also the index which is used to measure
p e rf o rmance under the Long-T e rm Per f o rmance Plan.
L o n g - Te rm Per f o rmance Plan
For 2003/04 and beyond the Remuneration Committee proposes to introduce a 3 year rolling Long-T e rm Per f o rmance Plan with
a w a rds under the new scheme based on an annual allocation of notional or d i n a ry shares equivalent to a maximum of 100% of basic
s a l a ry with vesting taking place at the expiry of the three year per f o rmance period of the plan, subject to attainment of the agr e e d
p e rf o rmance targets. 50% of the award will vest on attainment of a per f o rmance target based on Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS)
g rowth and 50% based on Total Shareholder Return (TSR).  A vesting schedule has been established so that in terms of EPS gr o w t h ,
the full 50% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the Retail Price Index (RPI)  plus 15% and 10% will vest if EPS growth exceeds RPI
plus 10%, with straight line vesting between these two points.  The remaining 50% will vest subject to TSR per f o rmance measur e d
against the constituents of the FTSE Construction and Building Materials Sector Index.  Again a vesting schedule has been
established so that the full 50% will vest if TSR growth is in the upper quartile of the comparative index and 10% vesting if TSR
g rowth is at the median of the index, with straight line vesting between the two points.
Executive Shareholding Guidelines
To facilitate the introduction of a share based Long-T e rm Per f o rmance Plan the Remuneration Committee has agreed to establish
the following Shareholding Guidelines for Executive Dir e c t o r s :
  Within five years of first appointment Executive Directors are expected to hold throughout their period of office or d i n a ry shar e s
in the company equivalent to 100% of their basic annual salary, pro-rata holdings are r e q u i red to be held in this first five year
p e r i od ;
  For the purposes of determining the requisite level of each Executive Directors Shareholding relative to basic salary, the share
price shall be that prevailing on 30th June in each year;
  P rovided Executive Directors hold the appropriate level of shares they shall be at liberty to sell shares so as to realise their Long-
T e rm Per f o rmance awards or in the exercise of share options subject to the normal Listing Rule r e q u i rements for dir e c t o r
s h a re h o l d i n g s ;
  Executive Directors have until 31st January in each accounting period to increase their shareholding to the appropriate level.
The auditors are r e q u i red to r e p o rt on the information detailed in the following part of this r e p o rt .

The accrued pension entitlement is the amount that the director would receive if he r e t i red at the end of the year. The Listing
Rules r e q u i re this to be disclosed excluding inflation.
The increase in the accrued entitlement is the dif f e rence between the accrued benefit at the end of the year and that at the
p revious year end.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11. The
transfer values of the accrued entitlement r e p resent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another
pension provider on transferring the scheme's liability in respect of the directors' pension benefits. They do not r e p resent sums
payable to individual directors and, ther e f o re cannot be added meaningfully to annual r e m u n e r a t i o n .
