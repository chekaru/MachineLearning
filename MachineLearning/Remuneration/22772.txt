Introduction
This year's remuneration report is presented to shareholders in accordance with the requirements of the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the Regulations ).  In preparing the report the Remuneration Committee has reviewed
remuneration policy for executive directors and in so doing has reaffirmed its commitment to ensure that overall remuneration
continues to be linked to organisational and individual performance and has a clear alignment with the interests of shareholders.
Remuneration Committee
The Committee operates within terms of reference and governance policies approved by the Board and is responsible on behalf
of the Board for:
  executive remuneration policy;
  determining the service conditions and remuneration of all executive directors;
  obtaining independent professional advice in relation to executive director remuneration;
  the evaluation of executive director performance with regard to the award of share options, annual bonus and other performance
based remuneration.
During the year under review the Remuneration Committee has met on 2 occasions (with all members present).
Membership and Proceedings of the Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee are all non-executive directors and during the year have comprised
Mr A E Kilburn (Chairman), Mr C G Toner, Mr M Pescod, Mr R J Davies, Mr R MacEachrane from his appointment on 1st May
2006 and Mr W Shannon from his appointment on 1st September 2005.  As reported earlier, Mr C G Toner stood down from
membership of the Committee on 14th September 2005.  Accordingly, all Committee members are now considered to be wholly
independent with no financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the Committee's decisions.  The Group Chief Executive
attends meetings of the Committee as required but he is not present when matters affecting his own remuneration are considered.  
Other than as expressly identified in this report the Remuneration Committee has complied with the Combined Code on
Corporate Governance.  The Committee recognises its accountability on executive remuneration to shareholders through this report
and in determining future remuneration policy it will consider both the shareholders' vote on the report and views expressed by
shareholders on the detail of the report.
Advice
Advice is provided to the Remuneration Committee by the Company Secretary, Mr L Dent, a practising solicitor.  Mr Dent also
acts as secretary to the Committee.  In addition, Hay Group were appointed by the Committee to advise on a range of issues,
including the current market positioning of the Group's executive remuneration having regard to a comparator group of other
housebuilding companies, including Persimmon, George Wimpey, Taylor Woodrow and Bellway.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited have advised the Company in relation to various pensions issues and, with effect
from 10th July 2004, were appointed to provide actuarial services to the Barratt Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
Remuneration Policy
As detailed in last year's remuneration report the Committee undertook a comprehensive review of executive remuneration
during 2005 and a number of changes were implemented.  Following on from that review no major changes have been made this
year to structure or policy as the Committee believes that executive remuneration:
  is fully aligned with the performance of the Company and the returns received by shareholders;
  rewards the sustained growth and profitability of the business;
  conforms with market-leading best practice.
Remuneration Report 30
Central to the Group remuneration policy is recognition that the sustained growth and profitability of our business is
determined in no short measure by the skill and commitment of the executive team.  The reward policy for executive directors
seeks to provide remuneration and other service conditions which will attract, retain, motivate and reward executive directors
of the highest calibre within the industry's highly competitive employment market.  Within these broad objectives the executive
remuneration package is based on the following principles:
  the greater part of remuneration paid to executives should be linked to the achievement of performance targets; currently
over 50% of the total executive remuneration package is performance based;
  performance related remuneration should align the interests of executives with those of shareholders by setting
performance targets based on measures of shareholder return;
  total remuneration for outstanding performance should be competitive with that available elsewhere in the sector.
The Remuneration Package for Executive Directors
The remuneration package for executive directors comprises:
  basic salary;
  annual performance related bonus;
  long-term share incentives;
  pension and other benefits.
Typically the performance related element of executive remuneration makes up more than 50% of the total package
excluding pension benefits.  The performance conditions which apply to the performance related element of executive
remuneration are the same for all executive directors and are set out in the following sections of this report.
Basic Salary
Basic salaries for executive directors are a fixed annual sum payable monthly in cash.  Salaries are set having regard to
individual responsibilities, skills and experience and are currently based on the market rate for similar positions in large
national housebuilding companies.  Salaries were reviewed during the year by the Remuneration Committee and an increase
of 3% was awarded, taking effect from 1st July 2006. This increase is the same as that received by other employees within
the Company. Details are shown in the table below.
  per Annum   per Annum
D A Pretty 522,725 (1 July 2005: 507,000)
S J Boyes 309,000 (1 July 2005: 300,000)
C Fenton 309,000 (1 July 2005: 300,000)
G K Hester 309,000 (1 July 2005: 300,000)
M A Pain 309,000 (1 July 2005: 300,000)
Annual Profit Related Bonus
The annual bonus is dependent upon the achievement of financial objectives and key strategic measures for the business,
set annually by the Group Board. For the attainment of 100% of target the amount of bonus will be 130% of basic salary.
The maximum amount of bonus which can be received by any executive is 180% of basic salary, for the attainment of 125%
of target. If actual performance falls below 85% of target then no bonus will be payable. Payment of the bonus is on a
progressive scale with proportionately more being attainable for performance over and above target.
Remuneration Report 31
Any bonus earned above target is deferred on a compulsory basis, with an opportunity for additional voluntary deferral. The
deferred amounts will be converted into shares, with an opportunity for additional matching shares to be received if further
performance targets are met.  These additional performance targets are the same as those used for the Long-Term Performance
Plan, as detailed below.
No part of the annual bonus is pensionable.
Share Option Plan
In November 1997 the Company adopted the current Executive Share Option Plan (the Plan ).  The grant of share options
under the Plan is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall
performance of the Group.  Options must be held for a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be
exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years.  The exercise of options granted under the Plan is subject to the
achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee namely that the growth in the earnings
per share of the Company over a period of three consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index
by at least 6% for options granted in 1997 and 1998 and by at least 9% for those options granted in and since 1999.
In accordance with best practice the Remuneration Committee reviewed the performance condition and for options granted
after 1st July 2004 the three consecutive financial years over which the earnings per share growth target must be met will
commence with the financial year during which the options are granted.  If the target is not met over this fixed three-year period,
then options will lapse.  There will be no retesting of performance.
No options have been granted under the Plan during this financial year. Options which have been granted in previous years
remain unchanged and details of the terms of these outstanding awards are set out below.
Long-Term Performance Plan
The Long-Term Performance Plan (the LTPP ) was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in
November 2003 to take effect from 1st July 2003.
Awards under the LTPP are based on an annual allocation of notional ordinary shares equivalent in value to a maximum of
200% of basic salary with vesting taking place at the expiry of the three year performance period of the plan, subject to
attainment of the agreed performance targets.  50% of the award will vest on attainment of a performance target based on Basic
Earnings Per Share (EPS ) growth and 50% based on Total Shareholder Return (TSR ).  For awards made in 2003 and 2004
a vesting schedule has been established so that, in terms of EPS growth, the full 50% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the Retail
Price Index (RPI ) plus 45% and 10% will vest if EPS growth exceeds RPI plus 30% with straight line vesting between these
two points.  The remaining 50% will vest subject to TSR performance originally measured against the constituents of the FTSE
Construction and Building Materials Sector Index.  Again a vesting schedule has been established so that the full 50% will vest
if TSR growth is in the upper quartile of the comparative index and 10% vesting if TSR growth is at the median of the index,
with straight line vesting between the two points. 
Shareholders approved a change to these performance conditions at the 2005 AGM, and for awards made in 2005 and
thereafter the targets are as follows. For the EPS element of the target, the full 50% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the RPI
Index plus 18% and 10% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the RPI plus 9%; for performance in between the award will vest on
a straightline basis.
For the TSR portion of the award a peer group has been formed comprising listed housebuilders.  A vesting schedule will be
drawn up by taking an average of the two highest and two lowest TSR figures for such companies over the performance period
and creating a mid-point and an upper quartile from those two figures.  The full 50% will vest if the Company's TSR is within
the upper quartile and 10% will vest at the mid-point mark; for performance in between, the award will vest on a straightline
basis.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed these targets in the light of current circumstances and considers that the targets
remain appropriate. Details of the maximum number of notional share awards made under the LTPP, subject to achieving the
full performance targets described above, during the last year are set out below.

Remuneration Report 32
Pension Benefits
All executive directors except Mr M A Pain are members of the Group's defined benefit pension scheme, which is now
closed to new entrants.  The scheme entitles the executive directors with the exceptions of Mr D A Pretty, Mr G K Hester and
Mr C Fenton to a pension on retirement at age 65 of two thirds of final pensionable salary after 40 years membership of the
scheme.  The executive directors are also eligible for dependant's pension and an insured lump sum of four times pensionable
salary on death in service.  The final pension is calculated from the highest yearly average pensionable salary over three
consecutive years during the last ten years of service.
The entitlements of Mr D A Pretty, Mr G K Hester and Mr C Fenton are restricted by the earnings cap imposed under the
Finance Act 1989.  Under a contractual arrangement entered into in 1992 Mr D A Pretty's pension accrues at the rate of
1/30th but it remains restricted to the earnings cap.
Special arrangements are in place for Mr D A Pretty in order to secure his services until retirement. Based on calculations
carried out by the actuary to the Group scheme Mr D A Pretty receives, with effect from 1st July 2003, a supplement equal
to 50% of basic salary, as disclosed in the emoluments table below.  
Following the introduction of the Lifetime Allowance Pension Rules on 6 April 2006 the Committee has agreed to make
changes to the existing pension provision. With effect from 1st July 2006 all executive directors will have a choice of
remaining in the defined benefit pension scheme as described above, or opting to leave this scheme and instead receive a
cash supplement equal to 25% of their basic salary. This choice is at the discretion of the individual executive directors.  
In lieu of membership of the defined benefit pension scheme Mr M A Pain receives a cash supplement equal to  75,000
per annum.
Service Contracts
All executive directors are engaged on identical terms on the basis of one year rolling contracts which can be terminated
by 12 months notice given by the Company or by 12 months notice given by the executive at any time.  There are no specific
provisions for compensation on early termination.  The contracts entitle executive directors to the provision of a Company car
and membership of a private health care scheme.

The accrued pension entitlement is the amount that the director would receive if he retired at the end of the year.
The increase in the accrued entitlement is the difference between the accrued benefit at the end of the year and that at
the previous year end, excluding inflation.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note
GN11.  The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to
transfer to another pension provider on transferring the scheme's liability in respect of the directors' pension benefits.  They
do not represent sums payable to individual directors and, therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
