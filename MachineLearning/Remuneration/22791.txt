Report of the Directors
Introduction
This year's Remuneration report is presented to shareholders in accordance with the requirements of the Directors' Remuneration Report 
Regulations 2002 (the  Regulations'). In preparing the report the Remuneration Committee has reviewed remuneration policy for Executive 
Directors and in so doing has reaffirmed its commitment to ensure that overall remuneration continues to be linked to organisational and individual 
performance and has a clear alignment with the interests of shareholders.
Remuneration Committee 
The Committee operates within terms of reference and governance policies approved by the Board and is responsible on behalf of the Board for:
  executive remuneration policy
  determining the service conditions and remuneration of all Executive Directors
  the evaluation of Executive Director performance with regard to the award of share options, annual bonus and other performance based 
remuneration
  obtaining independent professional advice in relation to Executive Director remuneration
Membership and proceedings of the Remuneration Committee
Membership and attendance of the Remuneration Committee is described on page 35 of the Report of the Directors. All Committee members are 
considered to be wholly independent with no financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the Committee's decisions. The Group Chief 
Executive attends meetings of the Committee as required but he is not present when matters affecting his own remuneration are considered. 
The Remuneration Committee has complied with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance. The Committee recognises its accountability on 
executive remuneration to shareholders through this report and through regular dialogue with institutional investors. In determining future 
remuneration policy it will consider both the shareholders' vote on the report and views expressed by shareholders on the detail of the report. 
Advice
Advice is provided to the Remuneration Committee by the Company Secretary, Mr L Dent, a solicitor and Mrs J Mee, the Group Human 
Resources Director. Mr Dent also acts as secretary to the Committee. In addition, Hay Group were appointed by the Committee to advise on a 
range of issues, including the current market positioning of the Group's executive remuneration having regard to a comparator group of other 
housebuilding companies, including Persimmon, Taylor Woodrow, George Wimpey and Bellway.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited has advised the Company in relation to various pensions issues and, with effect from 10 July 2004, 
were appointed to provide actuarial services to the Barratt Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
Remuneration policy 
Each year the Remuneration Committee reviews the policy on executive remuneration in the context of the business environment, best practice 
and market trends. There have been a number of important changes within the Group during the year under review. These changes include the 
appointment of a new Group Chief Executive, the retirement of a number of Executive and Non-Executive Directors, a significant acquisition and 
the inclusion of the Group in the FTSE 100 index. In light of these changes following the review a number of changes in practice have been 
adopted which are described in this Remuneration report. Although there have been some changes in the structure of executive remuneration the 
underlying principles remain the same, namely the Committee believes that executive remuneration:
  is fully aligned with the performance of the Company and the returns received by shareholders
  rewards the sustained growth and profitability of the business
  conforms with market-leading best practice
Central to the Group remuneration policy is recognition that the sustained growth and profitability of our business is determined in no short 
measure by the skill and commitment of the executive team. The reward policy for Executive Directors seeks to provide remuneration and other 
service conditions which will attract, retain, motivate and reward Executive Directors of the highest calibre within the industry's highly competitive 
employment market. Within these broad objectives the executive remuneration package is based on the following principles:
  the greater part of remuneration paid to executives should be linked to the achievement of demanding performance targets; currently over 50% 
of the total executive remuneration package is performance based

Report of the Directors | Remuneration report 
  performance related remuneration should align the interests of executives with those of shareholders by setting performance targets 
based on measures of shareholder return
  total remuneration for outstanding performance should be competitive with that available elsewhere in the sector
The remuneration package for Executive Directors
The remuneration package for Executive Directors comprises:
  basic salary
  annual performance related bonus
  long-term share incentives
  pension and other benefits
Typically the performance related element of executive remuneration makes up more than 50% of the total package excluding pension 
benefits. The performance conditions which apply to the performance related element of executive remuneration are the same for all 
Executive Directors and are set out in the following sections of this report.
Basic salary
Basic salaries for Executive Directors are a fixed annual sum payable monthly in cash. Salaries are set having regard to individual 
responsibilities, skills and experience and to competitive market practice. As part of the review carried out the Committee looked at the 
market rate for similar positions in large national housebuilding companies, and also, for the first time, for companies ranked 51-100 in the 
FTSE index. It is felt that this provides a broader perspective on pay, although the primary comparator group remains the housebuilding 
companies. The changes to salary agreed by the Committee reflect a significant increase in accountabilities for each position. Salary 
increases take effect from 1 July 2007 and details are shown in the table below.

Mr M S Clare 630,000 -
Mr S J Boyes 350,000 309,000
Mr C Fenton 350,000 309,000
Mr M A Pain 350,000 309,000
Annual profit related bonus
The annual bonus is dependent upon the achievement of demanding financial objectives and key strategic measures for the business, set 
annually by the Board. For the attainment of 100% of target the amount of bonus will be 130% of basic salary. The maximum amount of 
bonus which can be received by any executive is 180% of basic salary, for the attainment of 125% of target. Previously there was no cap to 
the bonus payment. If actual performance falls below 80% of target then no bonus will be payable. Payment of the bonus is on a progressive 
scale with proportionately more being attainable for performance over and above target. With effect from 1 July 2007 the minimum target 
below which no bonus is payable was raised to 90% and the maximum target was reduced to 110%. 
Any bonus earned above target is deferred on a compulsory basis, with an opportunity for additional voluntary deferral. The deferred 
amounts will be converted into shares, with an opportunity for additional matching shares to be received if further performance targets are 
met. These additional performance targets are the same as those used for the Long-Term Performance Plan, as detailed on page 44.
No part of the annual bonus is pensionable. 
Share option plan 
In November 1997 the Company adopted the current Executive Share Option Plan (the  Plan'). The grant of share options under the Plan is at 
the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group. Options 
must be held for a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years. The 
exercise of options granted under the Plan is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration 
Committee namely that the growth in the earnings per share of the Company over a period of three consecutive financial years should exceed 
the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 6% for options granted in 1997 and 1998 and by at least 9% for those options granted in and 
since 1999. 44
Barratt Developments PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Report of the Directors
In accordance with best practice the Remuneration Committee reviewed the performance condition and for options granted after 1 July 2004 the 
three consecutive financial years over which the earnings per share growth target must be met will commence with the financial year during which 
the options are granted. If the target is not met over this fixed three year period, then options will lapse. There will be no retesting of performance.
No options have been granted under the Plan during this financial year. Options which have been granted in previous years remain unchanged 
and details of the terms of these outstanding awards are set out below.
Long-Term Performance Plan 
The Long-Term Performance Plan (the  LTPP') was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in November 2003 to take 
effect from 1 July 2003.
Awards under the LTPP are based on an annual allocation of notional ordinary shares equivalent in value to a maximum of 200% of basic salary 
with vesting taking place at the expiry of the three year performance period of the plan, subject to attainment of the agreed performance targets. 
50% of the award will vest on attainment of a performance target based on basic earnings per share ( EPS') growth and 50% based on Total 
Shareholder Return ( TSR'). For awards made in 2003 and 2004 a vesting schedule has been established so that, in terms of EPS growth, the full 
50% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the Retail Price Index ( RPI') plus 45% and 10% will vest if EPS growth exceeds RPI plus 30% with straight 
line vesting between these two points. The remaining 50% will vest subject to TSR performance measured against the constituents of the FTSE 
Construction and Building Materials Sector Index. Again a vesting schedule has been established so that the full 50% will vest if TSR growth is in 
the upper quartile of the comparative index and 10% vesting if TSR growth is at the median of the index, with straight line vesting between the two 
points. 
Shareholders approved a change to these performance conditions at the 2005 Annual General Meeting, and for awards made in 2006 and 
thereafter the targets are as follows: for the EPS element of the target, the full 50% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the RPI plus 18% and 10% will 
vest if EPS growth exceeds the RPI plus 9%; for performance in between the award will vest on a straight line basis.
For the TSR portion of the award a peer group will be formed comprising listed housebuilders. A vesting schedule will be drawn up by taking an 
average of the two highest and two lowest TSR figures for such companies over the performance period and creating a mid-point and an upper 
quartile from those two figures. The full 50% will vest if the Company's TSR is within the upper quartile and 10% will vest at the mid-point mark; 
for performance in between, the award will vest on a straight line basis.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed these targets in the light of current circumstances and has agreed a change to the comparator group 
for the portion of the award based on TSR. The rationale for this is twofold: the decrease in the number of listed housebuilding companies which 
are appropriate comparators; and the Group's inclusion in the FTSE 100 index. For awards made during 2007 and thereafter the comparator 
group will comprise those companies ranked 51-100 in the FTSE index. The Committee believes that this will more closely align the interests of 
Executive Directors with those of shareholders.
The Committee also considered whether the comparator group used for the TSR portion of awards made in 2005 and 2006 remains a robust 
measure of the Group's performance, given that the comparator group now comprises only eight companies. It concluded that the measure 
remains robust, but it will continue to review this decision during the life of these awards.
Pension benefits 
Mr S J Boyes and Mr C Fenton are members of the Group's defined benefit pension scheme, which is now closed to new entrants. 
The scheme entitles Mr S J Boyes to a pension on retirement at age 65 of two thirds of final pensionable salary after 40 years membership of 
the scheme. The Executive Directors are also eligible for dependants' pension and an insured lump sum of four times pensionable salary on 
death in service. The final pension is calculated from the highest yearly average pensionable salary over three consecutive years during the last 
ten years of service.
The entitlement of Mr C Fenton is restricted by the earnings cap imposed under the Finance Act 1989, for service up to 5 April 2006. 
Following the introduction of the Lifetime Allowance Pension Rules on 6 April 2006 the Committee has agreed to make changes to the existing 
pension provision. With effect from 1 July 2006 all Executive Directors will have a choice of remaining in the defined benefit pension scheme as 
described above, or opting to leave this scheme and instead receive a cash supplement equal to 25% of their basic salary. This choice is at the 
discretion of the individual Executive Directors.

In lieu of membership of the defined benefit scheme Mr M S Clare receives a cash supplement equal to 30% of base salary per annum, and 
MrMAPain receives a cash supplement equal to 25% of base salary per annum. These cash allowances are in line with competitive market practice.
Service contracts 
All Executive Directors are engaged on identical terms on the basis of one year rolling contracts which can be terminated by twelve months notice 
given by the Company or by twelve months notice given by the Executive at any time. There are no specific provisions for compensation on 
early termination. The contracts entitle Executive Directors to the provision of a company car and membership of a private health care scheme.
Individual Executive Director's service contracts:
Executive Directors Service contract date Effective date Notice period
Mr M S Clare 26 June 2006 2 October 2006 12 months

Mr C Fenton 1 July 2003 1 July 2003 12 months
Mr M A Pain 23 January 2006 1 March 2006 12 months
Non-Executive Directors' remuneration
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is set by the Board on the recommendation of a Committee of Executive Directors and having 
regard to published data for the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors in listed companies. The remuneration of the Chairman is set by the 
Board on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee and having regard to published data for the remuneration of non-executive 
chairmen in listed companies.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are appointed under terms set out in a letter of appointment. They do not have service 
contracts and their appointments can be terminated (by the Board) at any time without notice and without compensation for loss of office. 
Under governance policies approved by the Board, Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a three year term and usually serve a second 
three year term subject to performance review and re-election. Beyond this a third three year term may be served subject to rigorous review. 
The Articles of Association will be amended at the next Annual General Meeting to remove the maximum upper age limit of 70 years which 
applies to all Directors.

Total Shareholder Return performance graph 
The following graph prepared in accordance with the Regulations shows the Group Total Shareholder Return  TSR' performance over the last five 
years against the FTSE 250 and a comparator index of listed housebuilders. From 1 July 2007 the Comparator Group has consisted of a peer 
group of listed housebuilders comprising Barratt Developments, Bovis Homes Group, Bellway, Crest Nicholson, Berkeley Group, George Wimpey, 
McCarthy and Stone, Taylor Woodrow, Persimmon, Wilson Bowden and Redrow. The Comparator Group in the TSR graph below was the peer 
group for all five years. Prior to 1 July 2007 the Comparator Group was the FTSE Construction and Building Materials Sector Index. The Board has 
chosen these comparator indices as the Group and its major competitors are constituents of one or both of these indices.

Mr D A Pretty left service on 31 December 2006 and started to draw his pension on 6 April 2007, and in addition to the pension shown received 
a lump sum of  196,830. The pension at 30 June 2007 reflects the fact that because retirement was before normal retirement age a reduction 
was applied.
Mr G K Hester's membership of the pension scheme ended on 30 June 2006.
Directors' own contributions have been deducted from the change in the GN11 transfer value over 2006/07.
The figures do not take account of any retained benefits of the members.
The accrued pension entitlement is the amount that the Director would receive if he retired at the end of the year. The Listing Rules require this 
to be disclosed excluding inflation.
The increase in the accrued entitlement is the difference between the accrued benefit at the end of the year and that at the previous year end.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11. The transfer values 
of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on 
transferring the scheme's liability in respect of the Directors' pension benefits. They do not represent sums payable to individual Directors and, 
therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
