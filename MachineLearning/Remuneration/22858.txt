remuneration report
introduction
This year's Remuneration report is prepared 
in accordance with schedule 8 of the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
(S.I. 2008/410) (the  Regulations') and will be 
subject to an advisory vote at the Annual 
General Meeting to be held on 17 November 
2010 (the  2010 AGM').
The key issues to be aware of this year are:
1.  Executive Directors did not receive a salary 
increase in the 2008 or 2009 calendar 
years, however they will receive one in 
the 2010 calendar year.
2.  The Company's final salary pension 
scheme ceased to offer future accrual of 
defined benefits for current employees with 
effect from 30 June 2009.
3.  Under the annual bonus scheme, the 
payment for on-target performance 
remains unchanged at 75%. However in 
order to incentivise performance the 
maximum potential for the year to 30 June 
2011 has been increased from 100% to 
150% of salary. Up to one-third of this 
maximum bonus is payable in Company 
shares and will be deferred for three years. 
It should be noted that prior to 2009 the 
payment for on-target performance was 
130% with a maximum bonus potential 
of 180%.
4.  A clawback provision applies to any annual 
bonuses paid and to any share awards 
granted under the Executive Share Option 
Scheme ( ESOS') and the Long-Term 
Performance Plan (the  LTPP'), subject, 
in the case of HMRC approved options, to 
the approval of HMRC. The Remuneration 
Committee (the  Committee') has retained 
its general discretion to reduce levels 
of bonus and share vesting where the 
Company's overall financial performance 
relative to the housebuild sector does not 
justify the indicated level of bonus or vesting. 
5.  For the year ending 30 June 2011, the 
Committee confirms that it will revert to its 
policy of granting LTPP awards rather than 
awards under the ESOS which was used in 
2008 and 2009. The Committee will 
maintain its preferred equal mix of Total 
Shareholder Return ( TSR') and Earnings 
per Share ( EPS') performance conditions 
and will be reverting to setting three-year 
targets. Further, the Committee recognises 
that the Group's recovery is not complete 
and therefore will not revert to making 
awards of 200% of salary; instead they will 
grant awards of up to 150% of basic salary.
6.  During the financial year ended 30 June 
2010, Executive Directors were granted 
further share options under the ESOS. 
Half of these awards are subject to TSR 
performance conditions and the other 
half are subject to a series of annual EPS 
performance conditions. One-third of the 
awards subject to the EPS performance 
conditions were based on the EPS 
performance for the 2009/10 financial year. 
Actual performance against the target was 
61% and as a result vesting of 10.17% of 
the total award has so far been achieved 
(see page 46 for further details). 
r emuneration c ommittee 
The Committee operates within Terms of 
Reference and governance policies approved

Membership and proceedings of 
the Remuneration c ommittee
The members of the Committee during the 
financial year were Bob Davies (Chairman), 
Bob Lawson, Bill Shannon, Rod MacEachrane 
and Tessa Bamford. The Committee met on 
six occasions during the financial year and 
attendance at each of these meetings is 
described in Table 2 on page 39 of the 
Corporate governance section. All Committee 
members are considered to be independent 
with no financial interest, other than as 
shareholders, in the Committee's decisions. 
The Group Chief Executive attends meetings 
of the Committee as required but he is not 
present when matters affecting his own 
remuneration are considered. 
The Committee has complied with the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
and recognises its accountability on executive 
remuneration to shareholders through this report 
and through regular dialogue with institutional 
investors. In determining future remuneration 
policy, it will consider both the shareholders' 
vote on the report and views expressed by 
shareholders on the detail of the report. 
The Committee is currently reviewing the 
requirements of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code introduced in May 2010 (the  New Code'), 
and will report the Committee's compliance with 
the New Code in the report and accounts for the 
financial year ending 30 June 201 1. Chart 1 - Group Chief Executive's

Advice
The Committee received input into their 
decision making from Mark Clare, the Group 
Chief Executive, Jayne Mee, the Group People 
and Customer Experience Director, and 
Laurence Dent, Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary. Laurence Dent also acts 
as secretary to the Committee. These 
individuals are not present when their own 
remuneration is being discussed.
During the year the Committee has taken 
advice from independent advisers, Hewitt 
New Bridge Street ( HNBS'), a trading name 
of Hewitt Associates Limited ( Hewitt'). 
In addition to advising the Committee, 
HNBS also provided the Company with 
advice on implementing decisions made 
by the Committee and remuneration 
benchmarking. HNBS's fees for providing 
such advice amounted to approximately 
 61,000 for the year ended 30 June 2010. 
HNBS and Hewitt did not provide any other 
services to the Company.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited 
has advised the Company in relation to various 
pension issues and has been appointed 
actuary to the Barratt Group Pension and 
Life Assurance Scheme since 2004.
r emuneration policy 
Each year the Committee reviews the policy on 
executive remuneration in the context of the 
business environment, best practice and 
market trends for the current and subsequent 
financial years. The underlying principles 
remain the same, namely, the Committee 
believes that executive remuneration should:
 be fully aligned with the performance of the  	
Company and the returns received by 
shareholders;
 reward the sustained growth and  	
profitability of the business; and
conform with market-leading best practice.  	
The Committee has the discretion to consider 
corporate performance on environmental, 
social and governance issues when setting 
the remuneration of the Executive Directors. 
The Committee does take into account 
environmental, social and governance risks 
when setting incentive structures for senior 
management to ensure these risks do not 
inadvertently motivate irresponsible behaviour. 
The Committee has considered the structure of 
the Executive Directors' remuneration packages 
from a general risk perspective and it is satisfied 
that the packages, which include a market 
competitive base salary, an annual bonus 
(with deferral) and long-term incentives do not 
encourage inappropriate risk taking. Risk is also 
taken into account when setting the targets and 
when determining entitlements under variable 
reward schemes; this is done by ensuring that 
targets, whilst stretching, are realistic, attainable 
and for the long-term benefit of the Company 
and that they are not achieved by taking 
inappropriate business risks. The Committee 
also considers the level of pay and employment 
conditions throughout the Group when setting 
Executive Directors' remuneration.
Central to the Group remuneration policy is 
recognition that the sustained growth and 
profitability of the business is determined in 
no short measure by the skill and commitment 
of the Executive Team. The reward policy for 
Executive Directors seeks to provide remuneration 
and other service conditions which will attract, 
retain, motivate and reward Executive Directors 
of a high calibre within the industry's highly 
competitive employment market. Within these 
broad objectives, the executive remuneration 
package for the following year is based on 
the following principles:
 performance-related remuneration should  	
be linked to the achievement of demanding 
performance targets; currently 
approximately 70% of the total executive 
remuneration potential is performance 
based (see Chart 1);
 performance-related remuneration should  	
align the interests of executives with those of 
shareholders by setting performance targets 
based on measures of shareholder return. 
With the exception of the share options 
granted in 2008, which were based on a 
return on capital employed performance 
metric, the Committee's policy is to use a 
combination of TSR and EPS performance 
conditions to achieve alignment; and
 total remuneration for outstanding  	
performance should be competitive with  
that available elsewhere in the sector.
Chart 1 demonstrates the balance between 
fixed pay (base salary, benefits and pension) 
and short and long-term performance related 
pay for the 2010/11 financial year for the Chief 
Executive based on a maximum payout basis.
t he remuneration package for 
executive directors
The remuneration package for Executive 
Directors comprises:
basic salary;  	
annual performance related bonus;  	
long-term share incentives; and  	
pension and other benefits.  	
The performance conditions which apply to 
the performance related element of executive 
remuneration are the same for all Executive 
Directors and are set out in the following 
sections of this report.
Basic salary
Basic salaries for Executive Directors are a 
fixed annual sum payable in monthly 
instalments in cash. Salaries are set having 
regard to individual responsibilities, skills and 
experience and to competitive market practice 
for similar positions in large national 
housebuilding companies and also for 
companies comprising the FTSE 250. 
Given that salaries for Executive Directors and 
Senior Managers have not increased since 
July 2007 and that the Company's final salary 
pension scheme ceased to offer future accrual 
of defined benefits for current employees 
with effect from 30 June 2009, the Board 
has approved a Company-wide 2% salary 
increase, in order to motivate and retain staff. 
This increase is comparative to salary increases 
made by other companies in the sector. In light 
of this, the Committee has approved a similar 
2% salary increase for Mark Clare and David 
Thomas. The Committee recognised that in 
respect of Steven Boyes and Clive Fenton, 
the two Executive Directors responsible for 
housebuilding operations, it is critical for the 
Company to remain competitive with others 
in the sector and to mitigate its exposure to a 
significant retention risk, especially at such a 
crucial time in the sector's recovery. Therefore, 
the Committee has approved a salary increase 
of approximately 1 1% for each of them.
Salaries with effect from 1 July 2010 are 
shown in Table 3 on page 45. 45

* Mark Pain stepped down from the Board on 21 July 2009 and is included in the table for prior year comparative purposes only.

Annual bonus
The annual cash bonus is dependent upon the 
achievement of demanding financial objectives 
and key strategic measures for the business set 
annually by the Board. These include operating 
profit, cash generation, personal objectives, 
customer service, health and safety and 
employee engagement. For the financial year 
ending 30 June 201 1 the Executive Directors' 
maximum cash bonus has been maintained 
at 100% of basic salary.
 
To ensure that the Company's bonus 
arrangements continue to incentivise 
management to rebuild profitability, the 
Committee has introduced a supplemental 
bonus of up to 50% of basic salary, which may 
be earned for significant over-performance. 
This element will be deferred into shares in 
the Company, which will be held under the 
Co-Investment Plan for a period of three years 
with a continued employment condition. 
No other performance conditions will apply 
to this award and the Committee has agreed 
that no matching shares will be awarded 
against these shares. Accordingly, the total 
annual bonus opportunity for Executive 
Directors will be 150% of basic salary for the 
financial year ending 30 June 2011. As with the 
2009/10 financial year, payment for on-target 
performance will remain at 75% of basic salary. 
It is worth noting that despite the increase in 
maximum bonus potential for the forthcoming 
year, on-target and maximum bonus levels 
were higher prior to the economic downturn, 
at 130% and 180% of salary respectively.
The Committee has retained a general discretion 
in the making of bonus payments, and will 
consider, among other factors, the underlying 
financial performance of the business relative 
to the sector.
As disclosed in the 2009 annual report and 
accounts, a one-off payment of  100,000 was 
made to Mark Pain during the year in 
consideration of the extension to his remaining 
in employment beyond his required notice 
period, until 31 October 2009. Mark Pain's 
other salary and benefits remained in place up 
until he left the Company on 31 October 2009.
For the financial year ended 30 June 2010, the 
Committee has approved a bonus payment of 
approximately 90% of basic salary to Executive 
Directors based on performance against 
financial, non-financial and individual objectives. 
The Committee believes that this level of bonus 
is justified on the basis that the Company has 
delivered operating profit before exceptional 
items (which determined 50% of the total 
bonus for the year) of  90.1m against the 
minimum threshold established for the 
bonus of  67m and the target level of  84m.
No part of the annual bonus is pensionable.
Bonus clawback
The Committee decided that for any bonuses 
paid in respect of the financial year ended  
30 June 2010 and later years it will retain a 
power of clawback. This can be invoked if:
(a)  it is necessary to restate the Company's 
accounts used to calculate a participant's 
bonus, in circumstances where the original 
over-statement has led to a bonus being 
paid which would not otherwise have been 
paid; or
(b)  the participant is found guilty of any criminal 
activity in connection with his employment 
and this related to an act which led to a 
bonus being paid to him or her. 
In such circumstances, the Committee may 
determine that bonuses will be retrospectively 
recalculated and, if bonus monies have been 
paid, the participant will be required to reimburse 
the Company for an amount up to the total 
amount of the net bonus paid less any bonus 
that the Committee determines would have 
been paid regardless of the event in question. 
share incentive schemes
During the year the Committee undertook a 
review of the share incentive schemes currently 
in operation and agreed that grant levels, 
performance criteria and vesting schedules 
remain appropriate to the Company's current 
circumstances and prospects. There have 
been no significant amendments to the terms 
and conditions of any entitlement under any 
scheme. Details of all Executive Director share 
option and long-term performance plans are 
set out on pages 45 to 49. 
n ew Awards to be granted  
during the financial year ending 
30 June 2011
The Committee has decided to grant LTPP 
awards to Executive Directors during the 
financial year ending 30 June 2011, instead 
of granting options under the ESOS.
The LTPP was approved by shareholders at 
the AGM held in November 2003. Awards 
under the LTPP are at the discretion of the 
Committee, taking into account individual 
performance and the overall performance of 
the Group. An employee is not eligible to 
receive options under the ESOS and awards 
under the LTPP in the same financial year.
Any LTPP awards that are made in the 2010/11 
financial year (the  2010/11 LTPP Award') will 
not exceed 150% of basic salary and will be 
subject to three-year TSR and EPS conditions. 
The vesting of 50% of the 2010/11 LTPP Award 
subject to TSR conditions will be dependent 
upon the Company's performance over three 
years against the constituents of the FTSE 
250, excluding investment trusts. The full 50% 
will vest if the Company's TSR ranks at the 
upper quartile or above, 25% will vest if the 
TSR ranks at median and none of the 2010/11 
LTPP Award will vest if the TSR ranks below 
median. The 2010/11 LTPP award will vest on 
a straight-line basis between the upper and 
median targets.

Remuneration report
Barratt Developments plc Annu Al Repo Rt A nd Accounts 2010
The 50% EPS element will vest on the attainment 
of the EPS target for the year ending 30 June 
2013. The Committee believes that a wide target 
range should be set for the EPS element in order 
to ensure full engagement from management by 
having an achievable minimum vesting level 
whilst requiring outstanding performance to 
achieve maximum level of vesting. Accordingly, 
the Committee has set the minimum vesting level 
at 10 pence per share and the maximum level 
of vesting at 25 pence per share. The award 
will vest on a straight-line basis between the 
minimum and maximum targets.
For the 2010/11 LTPP , vesting will be subject to 
an overriding Committee discretion, in that the 
Committee must be satisfied that the underlying 
financial performance of the Company over the 
performance period warrants the level of vesting 
as determined by applying the above targets. 
If the Committee is not of this clear view then it 
will be empowered to reduce the level of vesting.
partial vesting of Awards under 
the esos granted d ecember 2009
The 2009/10 ESOS is subject to TSR and EPS 
performance conditions. The Committee chose 
these targets as the most appropriate measure 
of financial performance for a housebuilder at 
the time of the grant, as they are a fundamental 
measure of the Group's underlying performance 
and are directly linked to the generation of 
returns to shareholders.
Performance conditions
50% of the 2009/10 ESOS will vest on attainment 
of a performance target based on relative TSR, 
and 50% on attainment of a target to be based 
on EPS growth.
The TSR element of the award will be calculated 
as the percentage change in share price plus 
dividends over a performance period against 
the comparator group comprising the FTSE 
250 (excluding investment trusts), with the 
opening share price averaged across the 
dealing days in the three-month period ending 
immediately before the start of the performance 
period and the closing share price averaged 
over the dealing days in the last three months 
of the performance period.
Levels of vesting against the TSR will be as follows:
Level of Vesting
Upper Quartile or above 50%
Median 12.5%
Below Median 0%
Between Upper Quartile 
and Median
Straight-line 
basis
The EPS element of the award has been divided 
into three one-year targets with the Committee 
setting targets annually for the forthcoming year 
in each year. The EPS for the Company will be 
calculated by dividing the profit for the year 
attributable to ordinary shareholders by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in 
issue during the year, excluding those held by the 
Employee Benefit Trust. Performance against 
the annual EPS target will be tested at the end of 
each of the financial years during the three-year 
performance period and each year's EPS target 
will determine the vesting level of one-sixth of the 
total award; however, actual vesting will not take 
place until after the year ending 30 June 2012.
The EPS targets, which are before exceptional 
items, and the level of vesting for the financial 
year ended 30 June 2010 were as follows:
Amount of EPS Element 
Available for Vesting 
(one-third of 50%) 16.67%
Minimum Target -4.4 pence
On Target -2.8 pence
Maximum Target -1.8 pence
Achievement Against Target 61%
Actual Level of Vesting 10.1 7%
It should be noted that the approach of using 
three one-year targets was adopted due to the 
uncertain economic conditions prevailing in 
2009. At that time, the Committee stated that it 
would revert to the policy of setting three-year 
targets at the earliest opportunity and this will 
be the case with the LTPP awards to be made 
during the financial year ending 30 June 2011. 
Both performance conditions applying to the 
2009/10 ESOS, are subject to an overriding 
Committee discretion to take into account, 
among other factors, performance relative to the 
sector and the underlying financial performance 
of the business including free cash flow.
Details in respect of the approval of the ESOS 
and the grants made under the ESOS in 
December 2008 (the  2008/09 ESOS') can 
be found on page 47 .
executive share schemes currently 
in operation
l ong-t erm performance plan
There is currently one unvested award under 
the LTPP which was granted by the Company 
in December 2007 (the  2007/08 LTPP'). 
Awards under the 2007/08 LTPP in 2007 were 
based on an annual allocation of notional 
ordinary shares equivalent in value to a 
maximum of 200% of basic salary with vesting 
taking place at the expiry of the three-year 
performance period of the plan, subject to 
attainment of the agreed performance targets. 
There is no re-testing of performance conditions. 
The Committee considered these targets to 
be the most appropriate measure of financial 
performance for a housebuilder at the time of 
the awards, as they are fundamental measures 
of the Group's underlying performance and 
are directly linked to the generation of returns 
to shareholders.
Performance conditions
50% of the 2007/08 LTPP will vest on 
attainment of a performance target based on 
TSR and 50% based on EPS growth.
The TSR portion of the 2007/08 LTPP uses a 
comparator group comprising those companies, 
excluding investment trusts, ranked 51-100 
in the FTSE Index and is measured over a 
three-year period against the comparator 
group. The levels of vesting against the TSR 
targets are as follows:
Level of Vesting
Upper Quartile 50%
Median 10%
Below Median 0%
Between Upper Quartile 
and Median
Straight-line 
basis
The EPS for the Company is calculated by 
dividing the profit for the year attributable to 
ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the 
year, excluding those held by the Employee 
Benefit Trust. The levels of vesting against 
the EPS targets are as follows:
Level of Vesting
Exceeds RPI + 18% 50%
Exceeds RPI + 9% 10%
Less than RPI + 9% 0%

The qualifying period for the 2007/08 LTPP will 
end on 21 December 2010. Performance of 
this award against the constituent TSR and 
EPS targets will be tested after this date.
c o-Investment plan
The only unvested awards as at 30 June 2010 
under The Co-Investment Plan (the  Plan') 
relate to the annual bonus earned above target 
for the financial year ended 30 June 2007 (the 
 2007 Award'). 47
Barratt Developments plc Annu Al Repo Rt A nd Accounts 2010
Gove RnAn ce
The Plan was approved by shareholders at the 
AGM held in November 2005 and any annual 
bonus earned above target will normally be 
compulsorily deferred into shares held under 
this Plan (the  Basic Award'). The Executive 
Directors also have the opportunity to voluntarily 
defer additional amounts of annual bonus up to 
a maximum of 25% of basic salary into the Plan. 
Matching awards will be made by the Company, 
if approved by the Committee, at the rate of one 
for one for compulsory deferral and at a 
maximum of four for one for voluntary deferral 
(the  Matching Awards'). The Matching Awards 
will be subject to performance conditions 
measured over a period of three years.
Performance conditions
The relevant TSR and EPS performance 
conditions for the 2007 Award are the same as 
those used for the 2007 /08 LTPP , as detailed on 
page 46, with a qualifying period which ended 
30 June 2010. The TSR and EPS performance 
conditions of the 2007 Award were tested after 
the year end and neither of the targets had been 
achieved. Accordingly, the Basic Award will be 
returned to participants and the Matching Award 
will lapse.
As the maximum annual bonus payable for  
the financial year ended 30 June 2010 was 
capped at 100% of basic salary there will be 
no compulsory deferral of annual bonus into 
the Plan for this year.
Any supplemental bonus earned (up to a 
maximum of 50% of basic salary) for the year 
ending 30 June 2011 will be deferred into 
shares held under the Plan. The Committee 
has agreed that no matching shares will be 
awarded against these shares.
executive share o ption scheme
The ESOS was approved by shareholders at 
the AGM held in November 2008. It was the 
view of the Committee that the focus on share 
price growth arising from the use of market 
value options combined with this performance 
condition would ensure strong alignment with 
shareholders. Having made grants under the 
ESOS in December 2008 and 2009, the 
Committee does not intend to grant further 
options under the ESOS during the financial 
year ending 30 June 2011 as an employee is 
not eligible to receive options under the ESOS 
and awards under the LTPP in the same 
financial year. 
Options awarded under the ESOS must 
normally be held for a minimum of three years 
from the date of grant before they can be 
exercised and lapse if not exercised within 
ten years of grant. The maximum number of 
shares over which an employee may be 
granted options in any financial year under 
the ESOS will be limited so that the aggregate 
cost of exercise does not exceed 200% of his 
annual salary. The exercise of options granted 
under the ESOS is subject to the achievement 
of an objective performance condition set by 
the Committee.
Performance conditions 
For the 2008/09 ESOS, the Committee decided 
to use Return on Capital Employed ( ROCE') as 
the financial performance measure. ROCE will 
be calculated as operating profit (measured 
across the whole year to 30 June 2011) divided 
by shareholder funds plus net debt less any 
intangible assets (being the average of the 12 
month-end figures during the same year). The 
Committee considered that ROCE was the most 
rounded measure of financial performance for a 
housebuilder at the time of this award and was 
satisfied that the ROCE target range represented 
a stretching target considering the outlook for 
the housebuilding market. There will be no 
opportunity to retest any performance criteria. 
The levels of vesting against ROCE will be 
as follows:
Level of Vesting
14.5% 100%
10.5% 25%
Less than 10.5% 0%

Award to Group Finance director
In recognition of his loss of benefit under his 
previous employer's long-term incentive and 
share option plans, David Thomas was granted, 
as previously disclosed, a one-off award which 
targets benefits equivalent to the options granted 
under the ESOS in 2008. The option was granted 
by the trustees of the Employee Benefit Trust 
and, if and when exercised, will be satisfied from 
ordinary shares acquired in the market. After 
adjustment for the Company's Placing and 
Rights Issue the option is over 1,016,656 ordinary 
shares, at an exercise price per share of 36.06 
pence. The option is subject to the same 
performance targets as the options granted 
under the ESOS in 2008 and is on substantially 
the same terms and conditions as those options.
esos clawback
The Committee has retained a power of 
clawback on any ESOS options granted during 
the financial year ended 30 June 2010 and 
later years on a similar basis to that described 
on page 45 relating to the payment of annual 
bonuses, subject in the case of HMRC 
approved options, to the approval of HMRC.
executive share o ption plan
The only vested award currently remaining to 
be exercised under the Executive Share Option 
Plan (the  ESOP') was awarded in 2003. 
The ESOP was adopted by the Company in 
November 1997 and options must be held for 
a minimum of three years from the date of grant 
before they can be exercised and lapse if not 
exercised within ten years of the grant date. 
The exercise of options granted under the 
ESOP was subject to the achievement of 
objective performance conditions set by 
the Committee.
Under the rules of the ESOP no further options 
can be granted under this plan. Options which 
have been granted in previous years remain 
unchanged and are set out on page 52. The 
award granted to Steven Boyes in 2003 vested 
in 2006 but has not been exercised.
savings r elated share o ption 
scheme 
The Savings Related Share Option Scheme 
(the  SRSOS') was approved by shareholders 
at the AGM held in November 2008.
The SRSOS was implemented in order to 
promote share ownership amongst all 
employees of the Company, linking employee 
benefit to the performance of the Company, 
and to aid retention of staff.
All employees and Executive Directors who 
work more than 25 hours per week and who 
have five or more years of continuous service, 
ending on the date of grant, or such shorter 
period as the Board may decide, with the 
Company, or any subsidiary in the Group 
nominated to join in the SRSOS, are eligible 
to participate in the scheme. The Board has 
discretion to reduce the period of qualifying 
service and to invite other employees of the 
Group to participate. Under the SRSOS, 
employees can save up to  250 per month for 
three or five years and receive options to 
purchase the Company's shares at a discount 
of up to 20% on the market value. In February 
2010, 704 employees (18.6% of those eligible) 
applied to participate in the second grant of 
options under the SRSOS.
pension benefits 
The Company's pension policy for Executive 
Directors is that they can choose to participate  48 Governance

in the Company's money purchase pension 
plan or receive a cash supplement that does 
not count for incentive purposes. The defined 
benefit section of the Barratt Group Pension 
and Life Assurance Scheme (the  Scheme') 
was closed to new entrants in 2001 and it 
ceased to offer future accrual of defined 
benefits for current members with effect 
from 30 June 2009. 
Mark Clare and David Thomas are paid a 
cash supplement equal to 30% and 25%, 
respectively, of basic salary per annum. Up until 
30 June 2009, when the defined benefit section 
of the Scheme ceased to offer future accrual of 
defined benefits for current employees, Steven 
Boyes and Clive Fenton were members of the 
defined benefit section of the Scheme. This 
entitlement was based on a 1/60 accrual rate 
and a normal retirement age of 65. The 
entitlement of Clive Fenton was restricted by 
the earnings cap imposed under the Finance 
Act 1989, for service up to 5 April 2006 and 
thereafter was calculated by reference to his 
basic salary. Since 1 July 2009, Steven Boyes 
and Clive Fenton are entitled to receive a cash 
supplement equal to 30% of their respective 
basic salaries per annum. Steven Boyes 
receives the full 30% as a cash supplement 
and Clive Fenton receives 20% as a cash 
supplement and the remaining 10% is paid into 
the defined contribution section of the Scheme.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the 
Scheme as at 30 November 2007 showed a 
deficit of  87 .4m calculated on the basis of the 
Scheme's technical provisions. This was updated 
to 30 June 2010 by a qualified independent 
actuary and a deficit of  46.1m is included in the 
Group balance sheet as shown in note 26. The 
Company and the Trustees of the Scheme have 
agreed that, with effect from 1 December 2008, 
the Company will pay, in addition to the joint 
contribution rate,  13.3m per annum for seven 
years to address the deficit.
On 30 June 2009, the Company exercised its 
consent under the rules of the Scheme and 
agreed to cease offering future accrual of 
defined benefits for its current employees. 
The Company will continue to pay the deficit 
reduction contributions at a level not lower 
than the  13.3m agreed in December 2008 
and will discuss the funding requirements of 
the Scheme with the Trustees if any material 
change in the Group's financial circumstances 
is anticipated.
Members of the Scheme became eligible to join 
the defined contribution money purchase section 
of the Scheme with effect from 1 July 2009. 
Only the basic salary element of a Director's 
remuneration is pensionable.
Members of the Scheme are also eligible for 
dependents' pension and an insured lump 
sum of four times pensionable salary on 
death in service.
service contracts 
All Executive Directors, are engaged on the 
basis of one-year rolling contracts which can 
be terminated by twelve months' notice given 
by the Company or by twelve months' notice 
given by the Executive at any time. Mark Pain, 
who stepped down from the Board on 21 July 
2009, could, and did, terminate his contract 
by giving six months' notice. There are no 
specific provisions for compensation on early 
termination or loss of office due to a takeover 
bid. The contracts entitle Executive Directors 
to the provision of a company car and 
membership of a private healthcare scheme. 
Details of Executive Directors' service 
contracts are included in Table 4.
n on-executive Directors' 
remuneration
The remuneration of the Non-Executive 
Directors is set by the Board on the 
recommendation of a Committee of Executive 
Directors having regard to the time commitment 
and responsibilities associated with the role. 
The remuneration of the Chairman is set by the 
Board on the recommendation of the 
Committee again having regard to the time 
commitment and responsibilities of the role.
The Chairman and each of the Non-Executive 
Directors are appointed under terms set out in a 
letter of appointment. They do not have service 
contracts and their appointments can be 
terminated (by the Board) without compensation 
for loss of office and by giving the appropriate 
length of notice as prescribed in their respective 
letters of appointment. The notice periods 
applicable to each of the Non-Executive 
Directors are, for Bob Lawson, three months' 
notice; for Tessa Bamford, Mark Rolfe, Bob 
Davies and Rod MacEachrane, one month's 
notice; and for Bill Shannon no notice is required. 
Under governance policies approved by the 
Board, Non-Executive Directors are appointed 
for a three-year term and usually serve a second 
three-year term subject to performance review 
and re-election. Beyond this a further term of up 
to three years may be served subject to rigorous 
review by the Nominations Committee. Details of 
Non-Executive Directors' letters of appointment 
can be found in Table 5 on page 49.

executive Directors 
shareholding guidelines
The following shareholding guidelines apply 
to Executive Directors:
 within five years of first appointment  	
Executive Directors are expected to hold 
throughout their remaining period of office 
ordinary shares in the Company equivalent 
to 100% of their basic annual salary;
 for the purposes of determining the  	
requisite level of each Executive Director's 
shareholding relative to basic salary, 
the share price will be that prevailing on 
30 June in each year; and
 provided Executive Directors hold the  	
appropriate level of shares they are at 
liberty to sell shares so as to realise their 
LTPP awards or upon the exercise of share 
options subject to the normal Listing Rules 
and Disclosure Rules and Transparency 
Rules requirements for Director 
shareholdings.
Both Steven Boyes and Clive Fenton met 
the shareholding guidelines until the recent 
economic downturn which resulted in an 
unprecedented reduction in the share price in 
early 2008. The Committee reviewed the value 
of the shareholdings of both Steven Boyes and 
Clive Fenton as at 30 June 2010 and found 
that Clive Fenton did not meet the 
requirements of the shareholding guidelines. 
Having regard to current economic conditions, 
the Committee is not requiring Clive Fenton to 
purchase additional shares to respond to this 
temporary position however it will review the 
position on or after 30 June 2011. 50 Governance

^  Following the Company's Placing and Rights Issue on 4 November 2009, all Share Scheme entitlements, including number of shares under 
option/award and option price per share, were adjusted to reflect the impact of the Rights Issue in accordance with the requirements of the 
schemes by a formula approved by HMRC.
The ESOS is divided into two sub-schemes, one of which is approved under the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 and 
the other which is not. The exercise price is calculated differently for each sub-scheme in accordance with the rules of the ESOS. 
The performance conditions for the ESOS grants are described on page 47 .
The performance condition set by the Committee for the ESOP award granted in 2003, that the growth in EPS of the Company 
over a period of three consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the RPI by at least 9%, was met in 2006, but the 
option has not yet been exercised. 
The mid-market share price of the Company on 30 June 2010 was 94.8 pence. The mid-market high and low share prices of the 
Company during the year were 294.8 pence and 93.7 pence respectively. During the year, 72,916,666 ordinary shares were issued 
at 240 pence per share pursuant to the Placing and 545,525,090 ordinary shares were issued at 100 pence per share pursuant to 
the Rights Issue. 53

With effect from 30 June 2009, the Scheme ceased to offer future accrual of defined benefit pensions for current employees and 
the link between accrued benefits and future salary increases was removed.
The total pension accrued at the end of the year is the amount that the Director had accrued when the Scheme ceased to offer 
future accrual at 30 June 2009 plus revaluation in line with the Scheme rules.
Whilst the inflation measure has been negative the accrued pensions have increased marginally in line with the Scheme rules.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the Occupational Pension Schemes 
(Transfer Value) (Amendment) Regulations 2008. The transfer values of the accrued pension represent the value of assets that the 
pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the Scheme's liability in respect of the 
Directors' pension benefits. They do not represent sums payable to individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added 
meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The increase in the transfer value includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the 
Company and its Directors, such as Stock Market movements.
The figures do not take account of any retained benefits the members may have.
Except as disclosed in respect of Clive Fenton on pages 48 and 50, none of the Directors have any rights under the Company's 
money purchase pension scheme.
There were no changes in the interests of the Directors shown above between 30 June 2010 and 7 September 2010. 
The Remuneration report was approved by the Board on 7 September 2010 and signed on its behalf by:
Robert Davies
Non-Executive Director
