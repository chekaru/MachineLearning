REMUNERATION REPORT
I am pleased to present the Directors' Remuneration  
report for the financial year ended 30 June 2011 (the 
 Remuneration report') on behalf of the Remuneration 
Committee (the  Committee'). The Remuneration report  
is prepared in accordance with schedule 8 of the Large  
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 (S.I. 2008/410) (the  Regulations') 
and will be subject to an advisory vote at the 2011 AGM. 
The Board recognises that the Group's remuneration policy 
should seek to attract, retain and motivate directors and 
senior managers of the quality required to enable successful 
future growth of the Company in a challenging market, whilst 
ensuring that executive remuneration remains aligned to  
the long-term performance of the Company and the interests 
of shareholders. In determining the levels of remuneration 
for Executive Directors, consideration is given to the overall 
performance of the Group, packages offered by comparative 
companies in the sector and the pay and employment 
conditions being offered to employees throughout 
the Group. 
Details of the Group's remuneration policy and remuneration 
packages of Executive Directors can be found on the 
following pages of this Remuneration report. However,  
key points to be aware of this year are:
1.  Executive Directors will not receive a salary increase  
for the 2011/12 financial year. To provide some context, 
there has been only one year where an increase was 
made to Executive Director salaries in the last four years.
2.  Under the annual bonus scheme, the payment for 
on-target performance and maximum potential remains 
unchanged at 75% and 150% respectively. Up to 
one-third of this maximum bonus is payable in Company 
shares and will be deferred for three years. It should  
be noted that prior to 2009 the payment for on-target 
performance was 130% with a maximum bonus potential 
of 180%.
3.  A clawback provision applies to any annual bonuses paid 
and to any share awards granted under the Executive 
Share Option Scheme ( ESOS') and the Long-Term 
Performance Plan (the  LTPP'), subject, in the case  
of HMRC approved options, to such approval. 
The Committee has retained its general discretion to 
reduce levels of bonus and share vesting where the 
Company's overall financial performance relative to the 
house build sector does not justify the indicated level 
of bonus or vesting. 
4.  For the 2011/12 financial year, Executive Directors will 
be granted awards under the LTPP . Consistent with the 
approach taken last year, the Committee has decided not 
to revert to making awards of 200% of salary; instead the 
level of the award will be maintained at 150% of base 
salary and will be subject to two performance conditions, 
half will be based on relative Total Shareholder Return 
( TSR') and the other half on Earnings per Share ( EPS') 
targets to be measured over a three year performance 
period commencing 1 July 2011.
5.  In December 2009, Executive Directors were granted 
share options under the ESOS (the  2009/10 ESOS'). 
Half of these awards are subject to TSR performance 
conditions and the other half are subject to annual EPS 
performance conditions measured over a three-year 
performance period. 9.6% of the award subject to EPS 
vested in 2010. The second third of the award subject to 
the EPS performance condition was based on the EPS 
performance for the financial year ended 30 June 2011. 
Actual performance against the target was 39.0% 
resulting in 6.5% of the award vesting. In total, 16.1% 
of the EPS element of the award has so far been achieved 
(see page 52 for further details). 
During the year the Committee complied with those  
aspects of the Code relevant to its business and seeks to 
demonstrate its accountability on executive remuneration to 
shareholders through this report and through dialogue with 
institutional investors. The Committee will consider both the 
shareholders' vote on the report and views expressed by 
shareholders on the detail of the report at the 2011 AGM 
in determining future remuneration policy for all employees.

CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 49
Remuneration Committee 
The Committee operates within terms of reference and governance 
policies approved by the Board. The full Terms of Reference are available 
from the Company's website at www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk.
Principal responsibilities
The principal responsibilities of the Committee are:
  determining and reviewing the overall remuneration policy of the 
Company with regard to attracting, retaining and motivating directors 
and senior managers of the experience and calibre required by the 
Company having regard to remuneration paid to employees and an 
external comparative group of companies;
  determining, reviewing and making recommendations to the 
Board on the remuneration package and letter of appointment 
of the Chairman; 
  agreeing targets and benefits in respect of performance related pay 
schemes, including long-term performance plans, for all participating 
employees which are sufficiently challenging, fair and highly 
motivating, commensurate with sector practice, and consistent with 
maximising shareholder value and the interests and expectations 
of shareholders;
  agreeing severance arrangements or other compensation for loss  
of office or early retirement for the Chairman, Executive Directors  
and other senior executives;
  determining, after consultation with the Chief Executive, the total 
individual remuneration package of each Executive Director and  
other senior executives including bonuses, incentive payments  
and share options/awards and pension arrangements; and
  undertaking consultations with institutional investors on remuneration 
policy and/or other aspects of senior remuneration, as appropriate. 
The Committee is also responsible for appointing consultants to advise 
on executive remuneration. Details of the consultants appointed during 
the financial year ended 30 June 2011 are set out below.
Membership and proceedings of the Remuneration Committee
The members of the Committee during the financial year were Bob 
Davies (Chairman), Bob Lawson, William Shannon (until he resigned 
as a Director of the Company on 21 October 2010), Rod MacEachrane 
and Tessa Bamford. The Group General Counsel and Company 
Secretary, Tom Keevil, acts as Secretary to the Committee. The 
Committee met on five occasions during the financial year and 
attendance at each of these meetings is described in Table 1 on 
page 39 of the Corporate Governance report. All Committee members 
are considered to be independent with no financial interest in the 
Committee's decisions, other than as shareholders and the fees  
paid to them as Non-Executive Directors. No material issues arose  
from the annual effectiveness exercise that the Committee undertook 
during the year although its Terms of Reference were updated as part 
of that process. Details of Directors' shareholdings can be found on 
page 56 of this Remuneration report.
Advice/Advisers
During the year the Committee has taken advice from independent 
advisers, Hewitt New Bridge Street ( HNBS'), a division of Aon Hewitt 
Limited. HNBS was appointed by the Committee as remuneration 
consultants in 2008 and is a founder signatory to the Remuneration 
Consultants Group's Code of Conduct. In addition to advising the 
Committee, HNBS also provided the Company with advice on 
implementing decisions made by the Committee and remuneration 
benchmarking. HNBS's fees for providing such advice amounted to 
approximately  27,000 (2010:  61,000) for the year ended 30 June 2011. 
HNBS and Aon Hewitt Limited did not provide any other services to  
the Company during the year (except for certain broking services related 
to employee benefits provided by another subsidiary of the Aon Hewitt 
Group, Aon Consulting Limited). In line with best practice, the 
Committee assesses, from time to time, whether the appointment 
remains appropriate or should be put out to tender as part of its 
effectiveness review. The Committee undertook such an assessment 
during the year and remains satisfied with HNBS's appointment as 
advisers to the Committee. Mercer Limited has advised the Company 
in relation to various pension issues and has been appointed actuary 
to the Barratt Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme since  
2004. Slaughter and May are the corporate legal advisers to the 
Company and have provided advice in respect of the operation of  
the Company's share incentive and share option plans and the  
Group's debt refinancing.
In addition to advice from external consultants, the Committee 
received input to their decision making from the Group Chief Executive, 
the Group People and Customer Experience Director and the Group 
General Counsel and Company Secretary. None of these individuals 
were present at any time when their own remuneration was 
being considered.
Remuneration policy 
The Group's remuneration policy aims to attract, retain, motivate and 
reward Executive Directors and senior managers who are fully focused 
and incentivised to sustain the growth and profitability of the business. 
Each year the Committee reviews the policy on executive remuneration 
in the context of the business environment, regulation and best practice, 
and market trends for the current and subsequent financial years.  
The Committee believes that executive remuneration should:
  be fully aligned with the performance and strategic objectives 
of the Company;
  be aligned with the interests and expectations of shareholders;
  take account of pay and employment conditions of employees across 
the Group; 
  reward the sustained growth and profitability of the business; and 
  conform with market-leading best practice and regulations. 
The executive remuneration package for the following year is therefore 
based on the following principles:
  performance-related remuneration should be linked to the 
achievement of demanding performance targets; currently 
approximately 70% of the total executive remuneration potential  
is performance based (see Chart 1 on page 50);
  performance-related remuneration should align the interests of 
executives with those of shareholders by setting performance targets 
based on measures of shareholder return. With the exception of the 
share options granted in 2008, which were based on a return on 
capital employed performance metric, the Committee's policy is  
to use a combination of TSR and EPS performance conditions  
to achieve alignment; and
  total remuneration for outstanding performance is competitive with 
that available elsewhere in the sector. Fixed Pay 31

Executive Directors' shareholding guidelines
The Committee has implemented the following shareholding guidelines 
for all Executive Directors in order to further align the interests of the 
Executives with the expectations of the Company's shareholders:
  within five years of being appointed to the Board, Executive Directors 
are required to build up, and retain, ordinary shares in the Company 
equivalent in value to 100% of their base annual salary;
  the share price to be used for the purposes of determining the value 
of the shares will be that prevailing on 30 June in each year; and
  provided that Executive Directors hold the appropriate level of shares, 
they may sell shares (i) to realise their LTPP awards; or (ii) upon the 
exercise of share options, subject to the normal Listing Rules and 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules' requirements for Directors' dealings.
Although these guidelines are currently only applicable to Steven Boyes 
and Clive Fenton, the Committee also reviewed the shareholding value 
for Mark Clare given that he will complete five years' service in October 
2011. Mark Clare substantially exceeds the shareholding threshold. Both 
Steven Boyes and Clive Fenton met the shareholding guidelines until the 
economic downturn in early 2008 which resulted in an unprecedented 
reduction in the share price. The moderate improvement in the share 
price during the year saw Steven Boyes exceed the minimum 
requirements of the shareholding guidelines whilst Clive Fenton's 
shareholding increased in value to 85% (2010: 70%) of his base annual 
salary. Having regard to the continued challenging and constrained 
market conditions, the Committee is not requiring Clive Fenton to 
purchase additional shares to respond to this temporary position  
but it will review the position again on or after 30 June 2012.
The remuneration package for Executive Directors
The remuneration package for Executive Directors comprises:
  base salary;
  annual performance related bonus;
  long-term share incentives; and
  pension and other benefits.
The performance conditions which apply to the performance related 
element of executive remuneration are the same for all Executive 
Directors and are set out in the following sections of this Remuneration 
report and details on how the expected values for share based 
payments are calculated can be found in note 28 on pages 110 to 116.
Base salary
Base salaries for Executive Directors are a fixed annual sum payable in 
monthly instalments in cash. Base salaries are reviewed annually having 
regard to individual responsibilities, skills and experience; salary levels  
for similar positions in other major housebuilders and other comparable 
companies comprising the FTSE 250; the level of pay increases awarded 
across the Group; economic and market conditions; and the performance 
of the Group. Any changes to base salary take effect from 1 July annually. 
Although market conditions have improved during the 2010/11 financial 
year they still remain constrained and challenging. In order to control 
costs, the Executive decided to award a 2% pay increase only to those 
employees below middle management. Accordingly, Executive Directors 
and other senior executives did not receive a salary increase for the 
2011/12 financial year. Executive Directors' salaries, with effect from 
1 July 2011, remain as shown in Table 2.
The Committee has the discretion to and does consider corporate 
performance on environmental, social and governance risks and 
issues when setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors and 
senior management to ensure that remuneration structures do not 
inadvertently motivate irresponsible behaviour. The Committee  
has considered the structure of Executive Directors' remuneration 
packages from a general risk perspective and is satisfied that 
remuneration packages do not encourage inappropriate risk taking. 
Risk is also taken into account when setting the targets and when 
determining entitlements under variable reward schemes. The 
Committee ensures that targets, whilst stretching, are: realistic 
and attainable; for the long-term benefit of the Company; and not 
achievable by taking inappropriate business risks. The levels of pay 
and employment conditions throughout the Group are also taken  
into consideration when setting Executive Directors' remuneration.
Clawback
The Company has a power of clawback in respect of any annual  
bonus paid and to any share awards granted under the LTPP or ESOS 
in respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2010 and later years 
subject in the case of HMRC approved options, to such approval. 
The clawback can be invoked if:
(a)  it is necessary to restate the Company's accounts used to calculate 
a participant's entitlement to bonus or share awards in circumstances 
where the original over-statement has led to a bonus being paid or 
share awards being granted which would not otherwise have been 
paid or granted; or
(b)  the participant is found guilty of any criminal activity in connection 
with his employment and this related to an act which led to a bonus 
being paid or share awards being granted to him or her. 
In such circumstances, the Committee may determine that the bonus 
and/or share award will be retrospectively recalculated. If bonus  
monies have been paid the participant will be required to reimburse the 
Company for an amount up to the total amount of the net bonus paid 
less any bonus that the Committee determines would have been paid 
regardless of the event in question. If share awards have been granted, 
the number of awards or options granted will be reduced accordingly. BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 51
Share incentive schemes
During the year the Committee undertook a review of the share incentive 
schemes currently in operation and agreed that grant levels, performance 
criteria and vesting schedules remain appropriate to the Company's 
current circumstances and prospects. There have been no significant 
amendments to the terms and conditions of any entitlement under any 
scheme. Details of all Executive Directors' share options and long-term 
performance plans are set out in Tables 7 and 8 on pages 57 and 58. 
Each of the share schemes currently in operation is subject to two 
performance conditions and a three-year performance period. Half of 
the awards will vest on attainment of a performance target on relative 
TSR and the other half on the attainment of a target based on EPS. 
The TSR and EPS performance conditions are calculated as follows:
TSR
The TSR element is calculated as the percentage change in share 
price plus dividends over a three-year performance period against 
the comparator group comprising the FTSE 250 (excluding investment 
trusts), with the opening share price averaged across the dealing days 
in the three-month period ending immediately before the start of the 
performance period and the closing price averaged over the dealing 
days in the last three months of the performance period. Performance 
against the TSR target is measured at the end of a three-year 
performance period.
EPS
The EPS for the Company is calculated by dividing the growth in  
EPS over a three-year performance period by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue at the end of the performance  
period (excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trust). For all 
schemes (except for the 2009/10 ESOS) performance against the  
EPS target is tested after the end of a three-year performance period. 
Details in respect of the testing of the 2009/10 ESOS can be found  
on page 52 of this Remuneration report.
New awards to be granted during the financial year ending  
30 June 2012
As per the 2010/11 financial year, the Committee has decided to grant 
LTPP awards to Executive Directors during the financial year ending 
30 June 2012.
The LTPP was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 
2003. Awards under the LTPP are at the discretion of the Committee, 
taking into account individual performance and the overall performance 
of the Group. An employee is not eligible to receive options under the 
ESOS and awards under the LTPP in the same financial year.
Any LTPP awards that are made in the 2011/12 financial year (the 
 2011/12 LTPP Award') will not exceed 150% of base salary and will be 
subject to three-year TSR and EPS conditions. The vesting of half of the 
2011/12 LTPP Award subject to a TSR condition will be dependent upon 
the Company's performance over three years, commencing 1 July 2011, 
against the constituents of the FTSE 250, excluding investment trusts.

Annual bonus
The Company's annual bonus plan aims to motivate and reward 
Executive Directors for the achievement of demanding financial 
objectives and key strategic measures as set by the Board. The 
Committee ensures that performance measures for bonuses are 
stretching whilst having regard to the nature and risk profile of the 
Company. The performance measures against which bonus payments 
for the 2011/12 financial year will be determined include pre-tax profit, 
cash generation, personal objectives and employee engagement. 
In addition to these performance measures, the Committee has 
introduced a penalty whereby 10% of any annual bonus earned will  
be forfeited for failure to achieve the on-target performance measure  
for either customer service or health and safety. As a result, were  
neither of these on-target performance measures to be achieved,  
in aggregate 20% of the annual bonus earned would be forfeited. 
For the financial year ending 30 June 2012, the Committee has 
maintained the maximum cash bonus for Executive Directors at  
100% of base salary. However, to ensure that the Company's  
bonus arrangements continue to incentivise management to rebuild 
profitability, Executive Directors may be awarded a supplemental bonus, 
of up to 50% of base salary, for significant over-performance measured 
against the pre-tax profit target only. This element will be deferred into 
shares in the Company, held under the Co-Investment Plan for a period 
of three years with a continued employment condition. No other 
performance conditions will apply to this award and the Committee  
has agreed that no matching shares will be awarded against these 
shares. Accordingly, the total annual bonus opportunity for Executive 
Directors remains at 150% of base salary for the 2011/12 financial year. 
The payment for on-target performance will remain at 75% of base 
salary. It is worth noting that the on-target and maximum bonus 
potential for the forthcoming year still remain below the levels in place 
prior to the economic downturn, which were at 130% and 180%  
of salary respectively. In addition, the Committee has retained a  
general discretion in the making of bonus payments, and will continue  
to consider, among other factors, the underlying financial performance 
of the business relative to the sector in its decision making.
For the financial year ended 30 June 2011, the Committee has approved 
a bonus payment of approximately 55% of base salary to Executive 
Directors based on performance against financial, non-financial and 
individual objectives. The Committee believes that this level of bonus is 
justified on the basis that the Company has delivered operating profit 
before exceptional items (which determined 50% of the total bonus for 
the year) of  135m against the minimum threshold established for the 
bonus of  135m and the target level of  150m. No part of the annual 
bonus is pensionable. REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS

a fundamental measure of the Group's underlying performance and are 
directly linked to the generation of returns to shareholders.
Performance conditions
Half of the 2009/10 ESOS will vest on the attainment of a performance 
target based on relative TSR, and the other half on the attainment of a 
target based on EPS growth.
Levels of vesting against the TSR will be as follows:
Rank of Company's TSR against 
comparator group
Level of vesting  
of TSR element
Upper Quartile or above 100%
Median 25%
Below Median 0%
Between Upper Quartile  
and Median
Straight-line basis  
between 25% and 100%
The EPS element of the award has three separate annual components 
with the Committee setting targets annually for the following financial 
year. Performance against each annual EPS target is tested at the end 
of each of the financial years during the performance period and each 
year's EPS target will determine the vesting level of one-sixth of the total 
award. However, actual vesting, if any, will not take place until after 
30 June 2012. Both performance conditions applying to the 2009/10 
ESOS are subject to an overriding Committee discretion to take into 
account, among other factors, performance relative to the sector and 
the underlying financial performance of the business including free 
cash flow.
The EPS targets are before exceptional items and the impact of the 
reduction in the corporation tax rate from 28% to 26%. The level 
of vesting for the financial years ended 30 June 2010 and 2011 were 
as follows:
2010/11 2009/10
Amount of EPS Element Available  
for Vesting (one-third of 50%) 16.67% 16.67%
Minimum Target 2.8 pence -4.4 pence
On Target 4.3 pence -2.8 pence
Maximum Target 7.3 pence 1.8 pence
Achievement Against Target 39.0% 57.6%
Actual Level of Vesting 6.5% 9.6%
*  In 2010 the Company disclosed that 10.17% of the award had vested for the 2009/10 financial year. Due 
to a change in the Company's tax charge for that year, which was included in the 2010 published financial 
statements, the Company's EPS was marginally reduced. Accordingly, the level of vesting was reduced to 9.6%. 
It should be noted that the approach of using three one-year targets  
was adopted due to the uncertain economic conditions prevailing in 
2009 when options under the ESOS were first granted. The Committee 
has since reverted back to the policy of setting three-year targets. 
Details of the grants made under the ESOS in December 2008 (the 
 2008/09 ESOS') can be found on page 58 of this Remuneration report.
Executive share awards granted during the year 
Long-Term Performance Plan
There is currently one unvested award under the LTPP which was 
granted by the Company in December 2010 (the  2010/11 LTPP'). 
Awards under the 2010/11 LTPP were based on an allocation of ordinary

Levels of vesting against the TSR condition will be as follows:

Upper Quartile or above 100%
Median 25%

Between Upper Quartile  
and Median
Straight-line basis  
between 25% and 100%
The other half of the award which is based on a EPS measure will 
vest on the attainment of the EPS target for the financial year ending 
30 June 2014. The Committee believes that a wide target range 
should be set for the EPS element in order to ensure full engagement 
from management by having an achievable minimum vesting level 
whilst requiring outstanding performance to achieve maximum level 
of vesting. 
Accordingly, the levels of vesting against the EPS will be as follows:
EPS target -  
Financial year 2013/14
Level of vesting  
of EPS element
30 pence per share or higher 100%
12.5 pence per share 25%
Below 12.5 pence per share 0%
Between 12.5 pence and 30  
pence per share
Straight-line basis  
between 25% and 100%
In addition to the above, vesting of the 2011/12 LTPP Award will be 
subject to an overriding Committee discretion, in that the Committee 
must be satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the 
Company over the performance period warrants the level of vesting 
as determined by applying the above targets. If the Committee is not 
of this view, then it is empowered to reduce the level of vesting.
Partial vesting of the 2009/10 ESOS 
The ESOS was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in 
November 2008. It was the view of the Committee that the focus 
on share price growth arising from the use of market value options 
combined with performance conditions would ensure strong alignment 
with the interests and expectations of shareholders at the time. Options 
awarded under the ESOS must normally be held for a minimum of 
three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and 
lapse if not exercised within ten years of grant. The maximum number 
of shares over which an employee may be granted options in any 
financial year under the ESOS will be limited so that the aggregate cost 
of exercise does not exceed 200% of their annual salary. The exercise 
of options granted under the ESOS is subject to the achievement 
of objective performance conditions set by the Committee.
As the Committee has decided to grant awards under the LTPP for 
the 2011/12 financial year it will not be making any grants under the 
ESOS as an employee is not eligible to receive options under the 
ESOS and awards under the LTPP in the same financial year. 
The last grant made under the ESOS was the 2009/10 ESOS, which 
is subject to TSR and EPS performance conditions. The Committee 
chose these targets as the most appropriate measure of financial 
performance for a housebuilder at the time of the grant, as they are  BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 53
of base salary). The Committee has agreed that no matching shares will 
be awarded against these shares. Any shares so awarded are subject to 
a continued employment performance condition. 
For the financial years ended 30 June 2010 and 2011 no supplemental 
bonus, as defined on page 51, was earned and therefore no shares 
were deferred into the Plan. As a result, there are currently no 
outstanding awards under the Plan. 
Savings Related Share Option Scheme 
The Savings Related Share Option Scheme (the  SRSOS') was 
approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 2008.
The SRSOS was implemented in order to promote share ownership 
amongst all employees of the Company, linking employee benefit to 
the performance of the Company and to aid retention of staff. All 
employees and Executive Directors who work more than 25 hours 
per week, and have five or more years of continuous service with 
the Company (or any subsidiary in the Group nominated to join in  
the SRSOS) ending on the date of grant are eligible to participate in  
the scheme. The Board has discretion to reduce the period of qualifying 
service and to invite other employees of the Group to participate.  
Under the SRSOS, employees can save up to  250 per month for  
three or five years and receive options to purchase the Company's 
shares at a discount of up to 20% on the market value. In March 2011, 
481 employees (11.5% of those eligible) applied to participate in the 
third grant of options under the SRSOS.
Outstanding Executive share awards
Executive Share Option Plan
The award granted under the Executive Share Option Plan (the  ESOP') 
in 2003 vested in 2006, however, there are a number of participants, 
including Steven Boyes, who are still to exercise the options granted 
to them. 
The ESOP was adopted by the Company in November 1997. Any 
options granted under the ESOP are required to be held for a minimum 
of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and 
will lapse if not exercised within ten years of the grant date. The level of 
vesting of these options was subject to the achievement of objective 
performance conditions set by the Committee.
Under the rules of the ESOP no further options can be granted under 
this plan. Options which have been granted to Executive Directors in 
previous years remain unchanged and are set out on page 58.
Executive share awards lapsed during the year
Executive Share Option Scheme
The options granted under the 2008/09 ESOS were subject to a 
Return on Capital Employed ( ROCE') financial performance measure, 
calculated as operating profit (measured across the whole financial  
year to 30 June 2011) divided by shareholder funds plus net debt less

figures during the same year). There is no opportunity to retest any

The options were tested after the year end and as the ROCE 
performance target was not achieved, the options lapsed.
shares equivalent in value to a maximum of 150% of base salary and are 
subject to three-year TSR and EPS performance conditions. There is no 
re-testing of performance conditions. 
Performance conditions
Half of the 2010/11 LTPP will vest on the attainment of a performance 
target based on TSR over a three-year performance period commencing 
1 July 2010.
The levels of vesting against the TSR targets are as follows:
Rank of Company's TSR against 
comparator group
Level of vesting  
of TSR element
Upper Quartile and above 100%
Median 25%
Below Median 0%
Between Upper Quartile  
and Median
Straight-line basis 
between 25% and 100%
The other half of the 2010/11 LTPP will vest on the attainment of  
EPS targets for the financial year ending 30 June 2013. The Committee 
believes that a wide target range should be set for the EPS element 
in order to ensure full engagement from management by having an 
achievable minimum vesting level whilst requiring outstanding 
performance to achieve maximum level of vesting. Accordingly,  
the EPS targets and corresponding levels of vesting are as follows:
 
EPS target - 
Financial year 2012/13
Level of vesting  
of EPS element
25 pence per share or higher 100%
10 pence per share 25%
Less than 10 pence per share 0%
Between 10 pence and  
25 pence per share
Straight-line basis  
between 25% and 100%
In addition to the above performance targets, the 2010/11 LTPP is 
subject to an overriding Committee discretion, in that the Committee 
must be satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the 
Company over the performance period warrants the level of vesting 
as determined by applying the above targets. If the Committee is not 
of this view, it has the authority to reduce the level of vesting as it 
deems appropriate. 
Co-Investment Plan
The Co-Investment Plan (the  Plan') was approved by shareholders at  
the AGM held in November 2005 and any annual bonus earned above 
target will normally be compulsorily deferred into shares held under  
this Plan (the  Basic Award'). The Executive Directors also have the 
opportunity to voluntarily defer additional amounts of annual bonus  
up to a maximum of 25% of base salary into the Plan. 
Matching awards will be made by the Company, if approved by the 
Committee, at the rate of one for one for compulsory deferral and at 
a maximum of four for one for voluntary deferral (the  Matching Award'). 
Any Matching Awards will be subject to performance conditions 
measured over a period of three years.
The Committee has decided to use the Plan to hold shares awarded in 
respect of any supplemental bonus earned (up to a maximum of 50%  200

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
GOVERNANCE
54 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011
Mark Clare and David Thomas are paid a cash supplement equal to 
30% and 25%, respectively, of base salary per annum. Up until 30 June 
2009, when the defined benefit section of the Scheme ceased to offer 
future accrual of defined benefits for current employees, Steven Boyes 
and Clive Fenton were members of the defined benefit section of the 
Scheme. This entitlement was based on a 1/60 accrual rate and a 
normal retirement age of 65. The entitlement of Clive Fenton was 
restricted by the earnings cap imposed under the Finance Act 1989 
for service up to 5 April 2006 and thereafter was calculated by reference 
to his base salary. Since 1 July 2009, Steven Boyes and Clive Fenton 
have been entitled to receive a cash supplement equal to 30% of their 
respective base salaries per annum. Steven Boyes receives the full 
30% as a cash supplement and Clive Fenton receives 20% as a cash 
supplement and the remaining 10% is paid into the defined contribution 
section of the Scheme.
The last full actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 30 November 2007 
showed a deficit of  87.4m calculated on the basis of the Scheme's 
technical provisions. The Company and the Trustees of the Scheme 
have agreed that, with effect from 1 December 2008, the Company 
will pay, in addition to the joint contribution rate,  13.3m per annum 
for seven years to address the deficit. The valuation for the financial 
statements was updated to 30 June 2011 by a qualified independent 
actuary and a deficit of  11.8m (2010:  46.1m) is included in the Group 
balance sheet as shown in note 26. On 30 June 2009, the Company 
exercised its consent under the rules of the Scheme and agreed  
to cease offering future accrual of defined benefits for its current 
employees. Members of the Scheme became eligible to join the 
defined contribution money purchase section of the Scheme with 
effect from 1 July 2009. The Company will continue to pay the deficit 
reduction contributions at a level not lower than the  13.3m agreed 
in December 2008 and will discuss the funding requirements of the 
Scheme with the Trustees if any material change in the Group's 
financial circumstances is anticipated.
Members of the Scheme are also eligible for dependants' pension 
and an insured lump sum of four times pensionable salary on death 
in service.
Service contracts 
All Executive Directors are engaged on the basis of one-year rolling 
contracts which can be terminated by twelve months' notice given 
by either the Company or by the Executive at any time. There are  
no specific provisions for compensation on early termination (except 
for payment in lieu of holidays accrued but untaken) or loss of office 
due to a takeover bid. The Committee will apply mitigation against  
any contractual obligations as it deems fair and reasonable and will 
seek legal advice on the Company's liability to pay compensation.  
The Committee also seeks to reduce the level of any compensation 
payable and takes into account, amongst other factors, the individual's 
and the Company's performance; the Director's obligation to mitigate 
his/her own loss; and the Director's length of service when calculating 
termination payments. The contracts entitle Executive Directors  
to the provision of a company car, annual medical screening  
and membership of a private healthcare scheme. Details of the 
Executive Directors' service contracts are included in Table 3 
and their emoluments are shown in Table 5 on page 56 of this 
Remuneration report.
Award to Group Finance Director
In recognition of his loss of benefit under his previous employer's 
long-term incentive and share option plans, David Thomas was 
granted, as previously disclosed, a one-off award which targets 
benefits equivalent to the options granted under the 2008/09 ESOS. 
The option was granted by the trustees of the Employee Benefit Trust 
and, if and when exercised, was to be satisfied from ordinary shares 
acquired in the market. After adjustment for the Company's Placing 
and Rights Issue the option was over 1,016,656 ordinary shares, at 
an exercise price per share of 36.06 pence. The option was subject 
to the same performance targets as the options granted under the 
2008/09 ESOS and was on substantially the same terms and 
conditions as those options. Accordingly, all of these options also 
lapsed after 30 June 2011.
Long-Term Performance Plan
The award granted under the LTPP in December 2007 was subject to 
EPS and TSR performance conditions over a qualifying period of three 
years to 21 December 2010. Performance against these conditions was 
tested after this date and as neither of the EPS nor the TSR conditions 
had been achieved, the award lapsed.
Total Shareholder Return performance graph
Figure 1, prepared in accordance with the Regulations, shows  
the TSR performance over the last five years against the FTSE 250 
(excluding investment trusts) and against an index of listed 
housebuilders. The Board has chosen these comparator indices 
as the Group and its major competitors are constituents of one or  
both of these indices. The TSR has been calculated using a fair  
method in accordance with the Regulations.
Pension benefits 
The Company's pension policy for Executive Directors is that they 
can choose to participate in the Company's money purchase pension 
plan or receive a cash supplement that does not count for incentive 
purposes. Only the base salary element of a Director's remuneration 
is pensionable. The defined benefit section of the Barratt Group 
Pension and Life Assurance Scheme (the  Scheme') was closed to 
new entrants in 2001 and it ceased to offer future accrual of defined 
benefits for current members with effect from 30 June 2009.  BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 55

Non-Executive directorships
Subject to Board approval, Executive Directors are permitted to 
accept one Non-Executive directorship outside the Company and 
retain any fees received from such a position. Executive Directors are 
not allowed to take on the Chairmanship of any FTSE 100 company. 
Board approval will not be given for any Non-Executive position, where 
such appointment would lead to a material conflict of interest, is with  
a competitor company or will have an effect on the Director's ability  
to perform his/her duties to the Company. During the year none of  
the Executive Directors held any Non-Executive directorships with 
other companies.
 
Non-Executive Directors' remuneration
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is set by the Board 
on the recommendation of a Committee of Executive Directors having 
regard to the time commitment and responsibilities associated with 
the role. The remuneration of the Chairman is set by the Board on 
the recommendation of the Committee again having regard to the time 
commitment and responsibilities of the role. The remuneration of the 
Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors is reviewed annually taking into 
account the fees paid by other companies in the housebuilding sector. 
The base annual fee paid to Non-Executive Directors during the financial 
year ended 30 June 2011 was  40,000. The Chairmen of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees received an additional annual fee of  10,000 
and the Senior Independent Director received an additional annual fee 
of  5,000. The Committee reviewed Non-Executive fees in July 2011 
and concluded that the fees were satisfactory for the role of and time 
commitments required from each of the Non-Executive Directors. 
Accordingly, Non-Executive fees have not been increased for the 
2011/12 financial year. The Non-Executive Directors do not participate 
in any performance related schemes such as the annual bonus or any 
incentive schemes, nor do they receive any pension or private medical 
insurance benefits. 
The Chairman and each of the Non-Executive Directors are appointed 
under terms set out in a letter of appointment. They do not have service 
contracts and their appointments can be terminated (by the Board) 
without compensation for loss of office and by giving the appropriate 
length of notice as prescribed in their respective letters of appointment. 
The notice period applicable for the Chairman, Bob Lawson, is three 
months and for each of the other Non-Executive Directors the notice 
period is one month. Under governance policies approved by the Board, 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a three-year term and usually 
serve a second three-year term subject to performance review and 
re-election by shareholders. Beyond this a further term of up to three 
years may be served subject to rigorous review by the Chairman and 
the Nomination Committee and re-election by shareholders. Details of 
Non-Executive Directors' letters of appointment can be found in Table 4.

the ESOS grants are described on pages 52 and 53.
The performance condition set by the Committee for the ESOP award granted in 2003, that the growth in EPS of the Company over a period of 
three consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the RPI by at least 9%, was met in 2006, but the option has not yet been exercised. 
The performance conditions of the 2008/09 ESOS awards together with the performance condition of the recruitment award to the Group Finance

Notes
With effect from 30 June 2009, the Scheme ceased to offer future accrual of defined benefit pensions for current employees and the link between 
accrued benefits and future salary increases was removed.
The total pension accrued at the end of the year is the amount that the Director had accrued when the Scheme ceased to offer future accrual 
at 30 June 2009 plus revaluation in line with the Scheme rules.
The inflation figure of 4.6% is based on the change in RPI from September 2009 to September 2010, consistent with previous years.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer Value) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2008. The transfer values of the accrued pension represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to 
transfer to another pension provider on transferring the Scheme's liability in respect of the Directors' pension benefits. They do not represent sums 
payable to individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The increase in the transfer value includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and its 
Directors, such as market movements.
The figures do not take account of any retained benefits the members may have.
Except as disclosed in respect of Clive Fenton on pages 54 and 56, none of the Directors have any rights under the Company's money purchase 
pension scheme.
There were no changes in the interests of the Directors shown above between 30 June 2011 and 13 September 2011. 
The Remuneration report was approved by the Board on 13 September 2011 and signed on its behalf by:
