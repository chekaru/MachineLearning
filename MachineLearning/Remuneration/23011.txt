 62 BBA Aviation Annual Report 2008
Directors' Remuneration Report 
This report covers the remuneration policy for directors and includes specific 
disclosures relating to directors' emoluments, their shares and other interests. It has 
been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Acts 1985 
and 2006, as amended by the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, 
and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. 
This report is being put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM for an advisory 
vote. As noted on page 56 in the Directors' Corporate Governance Statement, 
the Company did not comply in 2008 with the provisions of The Combined Code 
on Corporate Governance (the Combined Code ) in respect of the historical 
pensionability of bonuses and benefits in kind, which is referred to in section 3d 
below. Information in this report is unaudited other than that which is required to 
be audited and that is stated as such in the relevant table.
1. Remuneration Committee
Although the Board considers itself ultimately responsible for both the framework 
and the cost of executive remuneration, it has delegated prime responsibility for 
executive remuneration to the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee is a Committee of the Board consisting 
exclusively of non-executive directors. Its meetings are minuted by the Group 
Secretary. Details of the Committee's membership are set out on page 57 . 
It is responsible for determining executive directors' remuneration and reviewing 
proposals in respect of other senior executives. The Committee also determines 
targets for short-term incentive plans and performance-related share schemes 
operated by the Company and oversees any major changes in employee benefit 
structures throughout the Group. Further details of the work of the Remuneration 
Committee are set out on page 57 .
In carrying out its responsibilities during 2008 the Remuneration Committee 
was independently advised by Hewitt New Bridge Street (HNBS ) (a trading name 
of Hewitt Associates Limited which acquired New Bridge Street Consultants LLP on 
18 March 2008) who were previously appointed by the Committee for this purpose. 
HNBS also provided advice to the management in respect of individuals outside the 
terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee, provided calculations of total 
shareholder return in connection with the BBA 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan and 
provided some benchmarking information about non-executive directors' fees. 
Hewitt Associates Limited advises BBA Aviation plc in connection with its pension 
arrangements and provides Scheme Actuary services to the Trustee of BBA Income 
& Protection Plan, an occupational pension scheme of the defined benefit type 
sponsored by BBA Aviation plc. HNBS operates separately from the rest of Hewitt 
Associates Limited and there are provisions in place to ensure that there is no 
crossover of information between the two teams.
During 2008 the Committee also consulted the Group Chief Executive, the 
Group Finance Director, the Group HR Director and the Group Secretary in 
connection with the Committee's work, although not directly in connection with 
their own remuneration. It is expected that the Committee will wish to continue 
to consult with them in 2009.
2. Remuneration Policy
The Group's remuneration policy is to ensure that executive directors' and other 
senior executives' remuneration properly reflects their duties and responsibilities 
and is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate high calibre senior management 
capable collectively of delivering the goals of the Company. The Committee 
recognises the need to remain competitive in the different geographic areas in 
which the Company operates. The Committee believes that the remuneration 
arrangements described below remain closely aligned to the creation of shareholder 
value and to the business strategy of BBA Aviation. The Committee has also taken 
into consideration UK best practice for listed companies. In connection with the 
ABI Responsible Investment Disclosure Guidelines, the Remuneration Committee 
can confirm that it is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, 
social and governance issues when setting the remuneration of executive directors. 
Indeed health and safety objectives were core to the personal objectives of Simon 
Pryce and Bruce Van Allen in 2008. The Committee also believes that the incentive 
structure for senior management does not raise environmental, social or governance 
risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. The Committee reviews 
executive directors' remuneration at least annually and, in reviewing in 2007 the 
Group's remuneration policy into 2008 and beyond, it was clarified that the base pay 
portion of an executive's total remuneration should be set by reference to the local 
market whereas in setting short and long-term incentives reference should be made 
to the wider, global market. 
The main components of executive directors' remuneration are set out below. 
Total executive remuneration is structured to deliver potential upper quartile 
rewards for superior performance with a significant proportion of variable pay 
subject to stretching performance targets. The Committee believes that the 
remuneration packages of Simon Pryce, Andrew Wood and Bruce Van Allen contain 
a suitable balance of directly performance-related remuneration which links both 
the short-term financial performance of the Group and long-term shareholder 
returns with the executives' total remuneration. 
a. Salary, Benefits and Service Contract
The policy of the Committee is to provide base salaries that are positioned around 
mid-market when compared to local salary data. Salary is reviewed by reference to 
market conditions, financial and individual performance. In addition to basic salary, 
executive directors receive traditional benefits in kind, principally a company car 
allowance, private medical insurance and death in service benefits.
The policy of the Committee is to make new executive director appointments 
with a rolling service agreement which can be terminated by the Company on 
giving 12 months' notice.
b. Bonus
Annual cash bonuses for executive directors and senior management are based on 
financial performance and personal objectives which are set annually. Details of the 
2008 bonus arrangements are set out on page 63.
The Remuneration Committee carried out a review of remuneration 
arrangements in connection with the demerger in 2006. As part of that review, the 
Committee decided to increase the maximum bonus potential for executive 
directors during 2007 from 65% to 100% of salary with more stretching performance 
targets at entry level and above target. Approximately 85% of the maximum bonus 
is based on financial objectives with the remaining 15% based on measurable 
personal objectives. For 2008, 25% of bonus was subject to compulsory deferral 
into BBA Aviation shares and a further 25% may be voluntarily deferred under the 
BBA Deferred Bonus Plan. This structure remains unchanged for the 2009 bonus 
arrangements. The Committee believes that providing a greater proportion of 
variable pay subject to stretching performance targets which are linked to 
shareholder returns is broadly in line with current market practice. In setting the 
performance measures for the bonuses in 2009 the Committee concluded that 
there should be a greater weighting to free cash flow than in previous years, 
reflecting the changed economic environment. The deferral into shares also 
provides a direct linkage with shareholders' interests. The detail of the plan is 
provided in section 3b below.
c. Long-Term Incentives
The Remuneration Committee believes that a significant element of executive 
directors' remuneration should be linked to performance-related long-term 
incentives. The Company's schemes were reviewed in 2006 as part of the demerger 
and shareholder approval was given to three new share schemes, details of which 
are set out in section 3c below. The schemes were developed to take due account 
of market and best practice at the time of their establishment and provide long-term 
management focus and motivation. The Committee has also recognised the need 
for flexibility in this area to allow them to respond to changing market practices 
and different geographic norms. There are no current proposals to change the 
structure of this arrangement for awards to be made in 2009, although a review 
of the effectiveness of the structure of the total remuneration packages for senior 
executives will be conducted during the year.
As part of its strategy to align shareholders' and directors' interests, the 
Remuneration Committee expects all executive directors to build and maintain 
a holding of shares with a value at least equal to their base salary.
d. Pension
Pension provision for the executive directors varies and reflects differing UK and US 
practice. Further details are set out on pages 67 and 68.
Directors' Remuneration Report 63
3. Policy implementation: Directors' Remuneration
a. Salary, Benefits and Service Contracts
Base salaries are reviewed annually by reference to comparator groups selected on 
the basis of comparable size, geographic spread and business focus. Individual salary 
decisions take into account personal contribution, business performance and the 
level of pay awards elsewhere in the Group. Following a review at the end of 2008 
the Remuneration Committee approved (with effect from 1 January 2009) a base 
salary of  515,000 for Simon Pryce, of  343,250 for Andrew Wood and of $568,500 
for Bruce Van Allen, a 3% increase for Simon Pryce and Andrew Wood and a 2.5% 
increase for Bruce Van Allen, such percentage increases being broadly in line or 
below salary increases elsewhere in the Group.
Set out below are the contractual notice periods for executive directors who 
served during the year.
      Months' Notice
      Contract By To
       Date  Company Company
Simon Pryce    23/04/07 12 12
Andrew Wood    13/02/01 12 6
Bruce Van Allen    01/01/04 12 12
In the event of early termination, the Remuneration Committee will, within legal 
constraints, determine the approach to be taken according to the circumstances 
of each individual case, taking account of the departing director's obligation to 
mitigate his loss. In certain circumstances, and other than for termination for 
non-performance, the executive directors may receive compensation upon early 
termination of a contract which could amount to up to one year's remuneration 
based on basic salary, bonus, benefits in kind and pension rights during the notice 
period. During the second year after his appointment in June 2007 Simon Pryce 
may also, in certain circumstances relating to a change in control, receive additional 
compensation upon early termination of his contract of an additional 25% of his 
annual remuneration.
Table 1 (page 66) sets out details of the executive directors' salaries and 
non-executive directors' fees. 
b. Bonus
Bonus payments in respect of 2008 for Simon Pryce and Andrew Wood were 
calculated on the basis of the Group's adjusted earnings per share, Group free cash 
flow and the achievement of measurable personal objectives. Bruce Van Allen's 
bonus for 2008 reflected his operational responsibility for the Flight Support 
business (being based on the achievement of budgeted operating profit and 
operating cash flow), together with Group adjusted earnings per share and the 
achievement of measurable personal objectives.
The bonus for 2008 was expressed as a percentage of salary and the potential 
payout ranged from zero to a maximum of 100% of salary. For Simon Pryce, Andrew 
Wood and Bruce Van Allen 85% of the bonus was based on financial targets with the 
remaining 15% based on measurable personal objectives. The bonus payments in 
respect of 2008 are included in Table 1 on page 66 and reflect part achievement 
of the targets set by the Committee in January 2008. It was also provided that 25% 
of any bonus paid under this scheme to Simon Pryce, Andrew Wood and Bruce Van 
Allen would be compulsorily deferred into BBA Aviation shares with a further 25% 
voluntarily deferred at the director's discretion. Matching will be provided on the 
deferred shares, whether compulsorily or voluntarily deferred, on a one to one basis 
subject to meeting a total shareholder return (TSR ) performance criteria over a 
three-year period. The BBA 2006 Deferred Bonus Plan, details of which are set out 
below, governs the basis on which such deferral and matching is made. 
The performance condition used for the award of matching shares made in 
2008 in relation to the deferred 2007 bonus is the same total shareholder return 
condition that applies to the 2006, 2007 and 2008 conditional share awards and it is 
intended that the same performance condition will also be used for the award of 
matching shares made in 2009 in relation to the deferred 2008 bonus. This is set out 
on page 64.
In recognition of the forfeiture of potential bonus and other incentive awards 
from his previous employer, on Simon Pryce's joining BBA Aviation plc he was 
made an award of 213,700 shares on 18 June 2007 . This award (which is neither 
pensionable nor transferable) was made in accordance with the provisions of the 
Financial Services Authority's Listing Rule 9.4.2 which permits a company to enter 
into a bespoke long-term incentive plan arrangement without requiring formal 
shareholder approval in order to facilitate the recruitment, in unusual circumstances, 
of an individual. The shares subject to this award will be released in tranches 
subject to Simon Pryce's continued employment on the relevant vesting dates. 
No conditions other than this service condition apply to this award. In the event of 
a change of control of the Company prior to all shares being released, all unreleased 
shares will be released to him immediately. This award is included in the figures in 
Table 3 on page 66.
Bonus payments to the executive directors, Simon Pryce and Andrew Wood, 
in respect of 2009 will be calculated on a similar basis as payments in respect of 
2008, with the potential payout ranging from zero to a maximum of 100% of salary 
and with 85% of the bonus being based on financial targets (based on the Group's 
return on invested capital as to 25% and Group free cash flow as to 60%) with the 
remaining 15% based on measurable personal objectives. Financial performance 
targets and appropriate personal objectives for 2009 have been approved by 
the Committee. 
The performance measures for the bonuses in respect of 2008 and 2009 
were chosen by the Committee because each measure is a factor over which the 
individual has a direct impact. There is a greater weighting to free cash flow in 
the 2009 bonus arrangements than in previous years to reflect the changed 
economic environment and return on invested capital targets are being used 
in place of earnings per share targets in 2009 to ensure that appropriate focus is 
placed on this key metric (with earnings per share continuing to be used in the 
performance condition for the Long-Term Incentive Plan as described below). 
In the Committee's view the measures for the bonuses in respect of 2008 and 
2009 are collectively good indicators of corporate performance that should link 
to long-term shareholder reward. 
c. Long-Term Incentives
BBA 2006 Executive Share Option Plan,
BBA 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan and
BBA 2006 Deferred Bonus Plan (the 2006 Plans )
In November 2006 shareholders approved the 2006 Plans which together replaced 
the BBA Group 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2006 Plans permit the awards 
of options, conditional shares and matching shares.
Under the BBA 2006 Executive Share Option Plan, the maximum value of 
options which an executive may be granted in any year is limited to three times 
basic salary, or four times basic salary if the Remuneration Committee determines 
that an executive will not receive an award under the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
in that year. No options were awarded in 2008 and there is no immediate intention 
to operate the BBA 2006 Executive Share Option Plan.
Under the BBA 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan, conditional awards of shares 
are limited in value to one times the executive's basic salary or two times basic salary 
if the Remuneration Committee determines that the executive will not be granted 
options in that year. In 2008 conditional awards made to Simon Pryce were one and 
a half times basic salary, while those made to Andrew Wood and Bruce Van Allen 
were one times basic salary. The Remuneration Committee considers the award 
levels appropriate and in line with its policy to reward superior performance with 
potential upper quartile remuneration.
In 2006 conditional shares were not awarded until November due to the 
demerger process. The conditional share awards made in 2006 will potentially vest 
and be released to participants three years after the time at which awards would 
under normal circumstances have been made. The conditional share awards made 
in 2007 will potentially vest and be released to participants in April 2010, while those 
made in 2008 will potentially vest and be released to participants in April 201 1. The 
awards made in 2006, 2007 and 2008 are all subject to two performance targets. 
One half of each award is subject to a performance target that measures the 
Company's TSR against a comparator group of companies. The other half of each 
award is subject to an adjusted earnings per share (EPS ) performance target. It is 
expected that the same performance targets will also apply to the awards to be 
made in 2009. The comparator group of companies chosen in 2006 for the TSR 
element was based on FTSE 350 listed companies from the industrial transportation, 
travel and leisure, and aerospace and defence sectors. 64 BBA Aviation Annual Report 2008

The comparator group in respect of the 2006 award of conditional shares is:
Comparator Group 2006 Awards
Arriva Go-Ahead Group QinetiQ
Avis Europe Gondola Holdings Rank Group
BAE Systems Greene King Restaurant Group
BBA Aviation Intercontinental Hotels Group Rolls-Royce Group
British Airways Ladbrokes Smiths Group

   (now known as Thomas Cook) Whitbread
Enterprise Inns National Express William Hill
First Choice Hols 
(now known as 
TUI Travel) Northgate Wolverhampton & Dudley
First Group PartyGaming 
Forth Ports Punch Taverns 
The Committee reviewed the comparator group used for the 2006 awards in 2007 
and focused the selection of comparator companies on those that better reflect 
the markets in which BBA Aviation operates. The comparator group for the 2007 
awards was also used for the 2008 awards and will be used in respect of awards 
in 2009.
The comparator group in respect of the 2007 and 2008 award of conditional 
shares is:
Comparator Group 2007 and 2008 Awards
Arriva EasyJet Northgate
Avis Europe First Choice Hols 
   (now known as TUI Travel) QinetiQ
BAE Systems First Group Rolls-Royce Group
BBA Aviation Forth Ports Smiths Group
British Airways Go-Ahead Group Stagecoach Group
Carnival Meggitt Ultra Electronics Holdings
Chemring Group MyTravel Group
   (now known as Thomas Cook) VT Group
Cobham National Express 
If median position is not achieved in the TSR ranking, the TSR part of the award 
will lapse. TSR is measured by reference to the six months before the start of the 
three-year performance period and the three months after the end of the 
performance period and therefore the TSR element cannot usually be tested before 
April of the relevant year. If EPS growth over the performance period is less than the 
increase in the retail price index plus 3% per annum, the EPS part of the award will 
lapse. In neither case will there be retesting. In line with the method used to test the 
satisfaction of performance conditions under previous awards, the Remuneration 
Committee has chosen to have the benefit of the expertise of an independent 
remuneration consulting firm, Hewitt New Bridge Street, to calculate TSR and the 
external auditors will perform certain agreed procedures on the EPS calculation. 
The EPS growth is calculated on a constant exchange rate basis. 
Details of awards made to the executive directors under the BBA 2006 Long-Term 
Incentive Plan during the year are set out in Table 3 on page 66.
The Committee believes that the two performance measures chosen for its 
long-term incentive schemes - adjusted earnings per share growth and comparative 
total shareholder return - each represent a reasonable long-term indication of the 
financial success of the Company.
Under the BBA 2006 Deferred Bonus Plan, participants who defer part of their 
annual bonus may receive a matching award that will be limited to the number of 
shares purchased or that would, but for the payment of tax on the annual bonus, 
have been purchased. The Remuneration Committee required executive directors 
to defer 25% of any payment received in 2008 under the 2007 bonus scheme and 
permitted up to a maximum of a further 25% to be deferred. There are similar 
requirements in relation to any payment received in 2009 under the 2008 bonus 
scheme, or any received in 2010 under the 2009 bonus scheme. The Remuneration 
Committee is satisfied that the award levels under both the Long-Term Incentive 
Plan and the Deferred Bonus Plan are not excessive. In making these awards the 
Remuneration Committee took then prevailing remuneration practice and the wish 
for a significant portion of the executive remuneration to be linked to performance 
into account, as well as the importance of ensuring that high calibre senior 
management are retained and motivated to deliver the business strategy of 
BBA Aviation.
The vesting of any matching awards made in 2009 under the BBA 2006 
Deferred Bonus Plan will be subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition 
that will measure the Company's TSR against that of a comparator group over a 
three-year performance period.
The performance conditions in respect of the 2006, 2007 and 2008 awards of 
conditional shares will be measured over a three-year performance period:
TSR ranking in comparator group Percentage of TSR part of award vesting
At or above 75th percentile 100%
Between median and 75th percentile Pro rata between 25% and 100%
At median 25%
Below median Nil
EPS growth per annum Percentage of EPS part of award vesting
At or above RPI increase 100%
plus 7% per annum 
Between RPI plus 3% and 7% per annum Pro rata between 33% and 100%
At RPI increase plus 3% per annum 33%
Less than RPI increase plus 3% per annum Nil

BBA Group 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan and Share Option Schemes 
prior to 2005
The BBA Group 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan ) provided for awards 
of options, conditional shares and matching shares. Options granted in 2005 under 
the 2004 Plan were subject to the performance conditions set out below which 
were satisfied and the options vested in 2008. The Remuneration Committee 
approved the rebasing of the performance condition for the options granted in 
2005 so that earnings attributable to the Fiberweb business demerged in November 
2006 were excluded from the calculation. In line with the treatment of performance 
conditions under earlier Company share option schemes, the external auditors 
performed certain agreed procedures on the earnings per share calculation. 
The EPS growth was calculated on a constant exchange rate basis.
The performance conditions for options granted in 2005 under the 2004 Plan 
which were measured from the financial year ending just prior to the grant over 
a three-year period:
Average EPS growth above inflation Percentage of option exercisable
7% or more per annum 100%
3% to 7% per annum Pro rata between 33% and 100%
3% per annum 33%
Less than 3% per annum Nil
All executive options awarded by the Company prior to 2005 were made under the 
BBA Group 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme which expired in April 2004. Prior 
to March 2002 the BBA Group 1995 Executive Share Appreciation Rights Plan was 
used to facilitate the grant of options to US executives on the same basis as the 1994 
Executive Share Option Scheme.
BBA Group 2004 Savings-Related Share Option Scheme
Executive directors may be eligible to participate in the BBA Group 2004 Savings- 
Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all eligible UK employees. Options 
are granted under three or five year SAYE contracts at a 20% discount to the stock 
market price at the offer date. The maximum overall employee contribution is  250 
per month.

d. Pension
UK
Throughout the year under review, Andrew Wood participated in the Company's UK 
Defined Benefit Plan. It is the Committee's policy that the bonus of any new director 
joining the Company's UK pension plans from April 2000 will not be pensionable 
and accordingly pensionable earnings for Andrew Wood comprise basic salary only.
Andrew Wood's normal retirement age under the Defined Benefit Plan is his 
62nd birthday in line with that of existing directors who were members of the 
Defined Benefit Plan when he joined. In the case of death before retirement, a 
contingent widow's pension equal to two-thirds of the member's prospective 
pension is payable. Other dependants' pensions may also be paid. The Plan Rules 
guarantee pension increases in retirement by RPI up to 5%. Further discretionary 
increases are possible if RPI is above 5%.
Under the pensions legislation that was in force prior to April 2006 Andrew 
Wood's pensionable salary was further restricted by the state earnings cap. Prior to 
the changes which came into effect on 6 April 2006 (under the Pensions Act 2004 
and Finance Acts 2004 and 2005) the Company offered directors a top up to their 
pension benefits through a Funded Unapproved Pension Scheme (FURBS ). The 
Company's FURBS was closely related to the contribution the Company made to the 
approved Defined Benefits Plan less expenses and any special funding. The rate of 
contribution for Andrew Wood was 36% per annum of pensionable earnings in 
excess of the earnings cap. On 5 April 2006 the FURBS arrangements ceased as a 
result of the Simplification  regulations under the Finance Act 2004.
From 6 April 2006 revised arrangements applied to all the Company's UK 
pension arrangements as a result of both the Finance Acts 2004 and 2005 and the 
Pensions Act 2004. The Company and the Plan Trustee in respect of the Defined 
Benefit Plan agreed that a Notional Earnings Cap  should be implemented in place 
of the state earnings cap in order to limit the Company's exposure to increases in 
both Defined Benefit liabilities and additional matching Defined Contribution 
contributions. Directors and other employees whose earnings were above the 
Notional Earnings Cap were given a choice of receiving either a contribution to 
the Defined Contribution Plan or a cash replacement equivalent to the contribution 
that would have been paid to a FURBS. Andrew Wood elected to receive a cash 
replacement equivalent.
All the Company's UK Defined Benefit Plans were closed to new entrants from 
April 2002; new employees from that date have the option to join a Company 
sponsored Stakeholder style Defined Contribution Plan provided through an external 
investment manager. The Company matches the employee's contribution in a range 
of 3% to 7 .5% up to the state defined Earnings Cap (or a notional equivalent).
Simon Pryce does not participate in the Company's Defined Contribution Plan. 
A sum equal to 20% of his base salary is paid by the Company into his Self Invested 
Personal Pension. 68 BBA Aviation Annual Report 2008

i The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on normal retirement based on service to and pensionable salary at the end of the year.
ii  The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with legislative requirements and based on assumptions agreed by the Trustees of the Plan.
iii  The increase in transfer values between 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2008 is as a result of changes in pensionable salary, one year's extra service, increase in the age of the director, effects of changes in 
market conditions and changes in methodology in underlying transfer calculations.
US
Bruce Van Allen participates in the Group's Senior Executive Pension Plan for North America (the Plan ). The Company has funded projected Plan benefits since January 
2004. Benefits under the Plan are based on a five-year averaging of compensation (including bonus payments), less amounts received from other Company-sponsored 
retirement plans in which the executive participates. In the case of death prior to retirement, the accrued benefit reverts to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by 
the executive, and is paid in a lump sum.
The Plan provides that upon achieving age 62, Bruce Van Allen is entitled to receive an unreduced Plan benefit upon his retirement. In addition, he is entitled to a 
reduced benefit under the Plan should he elect to take early retirement. Bruce Van Allen also participates in a retirement savings (401(k)) plan sponsored by the Group 
company that employs him. Details of the Company contributions made to the 401(k) plan to his benefit are set out in Table 6.

Notes
i Accrued pension amounts shown for Bruce Van Allen are lump sums.
ii   The increase in transfer values between 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2008 is as a result of changes in pensionable salary, one year's extra service, increase in the age of the director and the change 
in the US dollar/sterling exchange rate over the year. 69
Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration
The non-executive directors each have a letter of appointment which is available 
for inspection by shareholders at each AGM and during normal business hours at 
the Company's registered office. No compensation would be payable for the early 
termination of the appointment of any non-executive director.
The level of fees for non-executive directors is determined by the Board as 
a whole on the recommendation of the Group Chief Executive. Non-executive 
directors' fees were reviewed in 2009, by reference to independent market surveys 
and benchmarking data, having last been reviewed in 2007 and, with effect from 
1 March 2009, are increased from  40,000 p.a. to  42,000 p.a. with the annual 
supplement paid to the Chairman of the Audit Committee being increased from 
 7 ,500 to  9,500. The annual supplement for the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee will remain at  7 ,500, that for the Senior Independent Director at  5,000 
and the annual supplement for the CSR Responsible Director at  2,500. These 
supplements reflect the increased commitments and demands placed upon each 
of the non-executive directors in performing their duties on the Board and its 
principal committees, particularly the Audit Committee. 
Details of the non-executive directors' fees for 2008 are set out in Table 1 
(page 66).
The dates of appointment or subsequent re-appointment and unexpired term 
of the non-executive directors as at 25 February 2009 are set out below:
