Directors' Remuneration Report 
This report covers the remuneration policy for directors and includes specifi c 
disclosures relating to directors' emoluments, their shares and other interests. 
It has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Large and 
Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008 and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. 
  This report is being put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM for 
an advisory vote. Information in this report is unaudited other than that which 
is required to be audited and that is stated as such in the relevant table.
1. Remuneration Committee
Although the Board considers itself ultimately responsible for both the 
framework and the cost of executive remuneration, it has delegated prime 
responsibility for executive remuneration to the Remuneration Committee.
  The Remuneration Committee is a Committee of the Board 
consisting exclusively of non-executive directors. Its meetings are minuted by 
the Group Secretary. Details of the Committee's membership are set out on 
page 48. It is responsible for determining executive directors' remuneration 
and reviewing proposals in respect of other senior executives. The Committee 
also determines targets for short-term incentive plans and performance-
related share schemes operated by the Company and oversees any major 
changes in employee benefi t structures throughout the Group. Further 
details of the work of the Remuneration Committee are set out on page 48.
  In 2009 the Remuneration Committee appointed Watson Wyatt 
Limited (now Towers Watson) to provide independent advice and assist the 
Committee in carrying out its responsibilities. Towers Watson advises the 
Remuneration Committee in relation to remuneration strategy and during 
2009 provided the Committee with benchmarking information about 
individuals within the remit of the Committee, background information about 
remuneration trends and calculations of total shareholder return in 
connection with the BBA 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2006 
Deferred Bonus Plan and advised on a number of alternative proposals for 
possible changes to the Company's remuneration plans.
  Towers Watson also provides advice to the Company in respect of 
individuals outside the terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee 
and on human resource policies, including benchmarking information and 
advice on healthcare and benefi ts provision and pension administration 
services and in 2009 also provided some benchmarking information 
about non-executive directors' fees. Towers Watson is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and is committed to that Group's voluntary 
code of practice for remuneration consultants in the UK.
  During 2009 the Committee also consulted the Group Chief 
Executive, the Group Finance Director, the Group HR Director and the Group 
Secretary in connection with the Committee's work, although not directly in 
connection with their own remuneration, and has consulted extensively with 
Michael Harper, since 5 October 2009 when he has no longer been a member 
of the Remuneration Committee (as explained in more detail on page 48 of 
the Corporate Governance Statement). It is expected that the Committee will 
wish to continue to consult them in 2010.
2. Remuneration Policy
The Group's remuneration policy is to ensure that executive directors' and 
other senior executives' remuneration properly refl ects their duties and 
responsibilities and is suffi  cient to attract, retain and motivate high calibre 
senior management capable collectively of delivering the goals of the 
Company. The Remuneration Committee believes that a signifi cant element 
of executive directors' remuneration should be linked to performance-related 
long-term incentives and accordingly remuneration plans were developed to 
take due account of market and best practice at the time of their 
establishment in 2006 when the Company demerged. As mentioned in the 
Annual Report 2008, during 2009 a review of the structure of the total 
remuneration packages for senior executives was conducted. Shareholders 
representing over 45% of the Company's share register were consulted about 
a number of changes designed to better align executive remuneration with 
the strategic objectives of the Group and the interests of the shareholders. As 
a result, a number of changes are being introduced in 2010 to the structure 
and balance of the key elements of the Company's remuneration package. 
These are summarised below and are also cross referred to in the relevant 
sections of this Remuneration Report.
  The annual bonus opportunity will increase from 100% to 125% of salary for 
executive directors but with half of any bonus payable compulsorily 
deferred into shares which are forfeitable if the individual leaves prior to the 
vesting date (vesting being phased over three years). This compares with a 
compulsory bonus deferral into shares of 25% of bonus paid under the 2009 
bonus plan with no forfeiture provisions. The doubling of the amount of the 
annual bonus required to be deferred into shares reduces the cash value of 
the annual bonus, deferring the full benefi t of any annual bonus payable for 
a further three years. The 2010 annual bonus will not be fully paid out until 
2014, a year later than any share awards made in 2010 under the Long-Term 
Incentive Plan would vest.
  There will continue to be the opportunity for additional voluntary deferral of 
bonus but it will be expanded to enable up to 100% (instead of the current 
50%) of any cash bonus payable to be deferred into shares. Any voluntarily 
deferred portion of bonus would be held as shares in the Employee Benefi t 
Trust on behalf of the participants, without any forfeiture provisions.
  Bonus deferred into shares (whether compulsorily or voluntarily) will benefi t 
(as currently) from a matching award of shares up to a maximum of 1:1. The 
applicable performance condition for those awards made in 201 1 in respect 
of 2010 bonus payments will be based on the more relevant Company 
fi nancial measure of return on invested capital (ROIC). Targets will be agreed 
at the time of award for the relevant three-year performance period by the 
Remuneration Committee on behalf of the Board, based on the Company's 
strategic plan and the Company's estimated cost of capital. Matching awards 
will continue to lapse (except in certain agreed situations, such as 
redundancy) if the individual leaves prior to the vesting date.
  The size of future awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan will be 
reduced to a face value of half base salary for executive directors other than 
Simon Pryce for whom the award will be reduced to one times face value of 
base salary. This change is made in conjunction with the increase in bonus 
potential and increase in compulsory deferral into shares for three years. 
These awards too will continue to lapse (except in certain agreed situations, 
such as redundancy) if the individual leaves prior to the vesting date. The 
performance conditions for the three-year performance period will be solely 
earnings per share (EPS) based and will be set at the beginning of each 
performance period.
  All unvested awards to Executive Management Committee members will 
be subject to explicit provisions in the event of material fi nancial 
misstatement.

The Committee feels that these changes are in the best interests of both the 
Company and its stakeholders, improving the alignment and motivation of 
senior executives to deliver against the Company's strategic objectives, 
enabling them to be rewarded for sustainable, rather than short term, 
performance and creating more eff ective retention arrangements, thereby 
ensuring the Company gets better economic benefi t from the accounting 
costs of incentive schemes.
  The Committee recognises the need to remain competitive in the 
diff erent geographic areas in which the Company operates and places high 
importance on the need for the remuneration arrangements for senior 
executives to remain closely aligned to the creation of shareholder value and 
to the business strategy of BBA Aviation. The Committee took into 
consideration then current UK best practice for listed companies as it was 
undertaking its review in 2009 of the Company's remuneration plans and is 
aware that what is considered to be best practice is constantly evolving and 
that diff erent market participants have diff erent views of what is best practice. 
In connection with the ABI Responsible Investment Disclosure Guidelines, the 
Remuneration Committee can confi rm that it is able to consider corporate 
performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting 
the remuneration of executive directors. The Committee also believes that 
the incentive structure for senior management does not raise environmental, 
social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour 
and is compatible with the Company's risk policies and systems. 
  Total executive remuneration is structured to deliver potential 
upper quartile rewards for superior performance with a signifi cant proportion 
of variable pay subject to stretching performance targets. The Committee 
believes that the remuneration packages of the executive directors contain a 
suitable balance of directly performance-related remuneration which links 
both the short-term fi nancial performance of the Group and long-term 
shareholder returns with the executives' total remuneration. 
3. Executive Directors' Remuneration
There are four main components of executive directors' remuneration: 
  salary, benefi ts and service contract; 
  annual and deferred bonus;
  long-term incentives; and 
  pension.
Both the policy and the implementation of the policy relating to these four 
main components are set out below. 
a. Salary, Benefits and Service Contract: policy 
The policy of the Committee is to provide base salaries that are positioned 
around mid-market when compared with local salary data. Salary is reviewed 
by reference to market conditions, fi nancial and individual performance. The 
base pay portion of an executive's total remuneration is set by reference to the 
local market in which they work whereas in setting short and long-term 
incentives reference is made to the wider, global market. 
  In addition to basic salary, executive directors receive traditional 
benefi ts in kind, principally a company car allowance, private medical 
insurance and death in service benefi ts.
  The policy of the Committee is to make new executive director 
appointments with a rolling service agreement which can be terminated by 
the Company on giving 12 months' notice.
b. Salary, Benefits and Service Contract: implementation 
Base salaries are reviewed annually by reference to comparator groups 
selected on the basis of comparable size, geographic spread and business 
focus. Individual salary decisions take into account market conditions, 
business performance, personal contribution and the level of pay awards 
elsewhere in the Group. Following a review at the end of 2009 the 
Remuneration Committee approved (with eff ect from 1 January 2010) a base 
salary of  525,300 for Simon Pryce and of  350,115 for Andrew Wood, a 2% 
increase, such percentage increases being broadly in line or below average 
salary increases across the Group. The Committee has been advised by the 
Group HR Director about pay and conditions of employees in the rest of the 
Group and these factors are taken into account when determining directors' 
remuneration. 
  Set out below are the contractual notice periods for executive 
directors who served during the year.
    Months' Notice
  Contract By To
  Date  Company Company
Simon Pryce 23/04/07 12 12
Andrew Wood 13/02/01 12 6
Bruce Van Allen 01/01/04 12 12
In the event of early termination, the Remuneration Committee will, within 
legal constraints, determine the approach to be taken according to the 
circumstances of each individual case, taking account of the departing 
director's obligation to mitigate his loss. In certain circumstances, and other 
than for termination for non-performance, the executive directors may 
receive compensation upon early termination of a contract which could, 
depending on the circumstances at the relevant time, amount to up to one 
year's remuneration based on basic salary, bonus, benefi ts in kind and pension 
rights during the notice period.
  Table 1 (page 57) sets out details of the executive directors' salaries 
and non-executive directors' fees. 
c. Annual and Deferred Bonus: policy
Annual cash bonuses for executive directors and senior management are 
based on stretching fi nancial performance and personal objectives which are 
set annually. 
  The structure for the 2009 bonus arrangements was that the 
maximum bonus potential for executive directors was 100% of salary, with 
85% of the maximum bonus based on fi nancial objectives (with a maximum 
of 25% for achievement of Group ROIC targets and 60% for achievement of 
Group free cash fl ow targets) and the remaining 15% based on measurable 
personal objectives. In setting the performance measures for the bonuses in 
2009 the Committee concluded that there should be a greater weighting to 
free cash fl ow than in previous years, refl ecting the changed economic 
environment. For 2009, 25% of bonus was subject to compulsory deferral into 
BBA Aviation shares and a further 25% may be voluntarily deferred under the 
BBA Deferred Bonus Plan. The Committee believes that providing a signifi cant 
proportion of variable pay subject to stretching performance targets is 
appropriate. The deferral into shares also provides a direct linkage with 
shareholders' interests and this element is being substantially increased for 
the 2010 bonuses payable in 201 1 as outlined above.
  As a result of the review of remuneration strategy in 2009, this 
structure is being varied for the 2010 bonus arrangements; bonuses in respect 
of 2010 will be structured as follows:
  the maximum bonus potential for executive directors for 2010 will be 125% 
of salary;
  the compulsory deferral into shares will be half of the 2010 bonus paid and 
this compulsorily deferred bonus is subject to forfeiture provisions for those 
who leave within the three-year performance period. In addition there is a 
further 50% voluntary deferral available; and 
  84% of the maximum bonus will be based on fi nancial objectives and the 
remaining 16% based on measurable personal objectives.  54
While the maximum potential bonus has been increased in 2010, there has 
also been an increase in the proportion of any bonus payable which must be 
deferred into shares for three years and a corresponding reduction is being 
made to the awards under the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan to re-balance 
the remuneration package without increasing the overall variable opportunity 
for meeting target. If all of the bonus targets are met and the maximum bonus 
earned is fully deferred into shares, then, if the performance conditions 
relating to the associated matching award are met so that the maximum 
number of matching shares vest, the total variable pay would increase under 
the new arrangements. The increase in the compulsorily deferred element of 
bonus extends each annual bonus scheme's period from one to four years.
  The performance measures for the bonuses in respect of 2009 and 
2010 (detailed in the implementation section below) were chosen by the 
Committee because each measure is a factor over which the individual has a 
direct impact. There is a greater weighting to free cash fl ow in the bonus 
arrangements for these years than there was in previous years to refl ect the 
changed economic environment. The targets for the matching awards in 201 1 
in respect of deferred 2010 bonuses will be based on ROIC to ensure that 
appropriate focus is placed on this key metric (with EPS continuing to be used 
as a performance condition for the Long-Term Incentive Plan as described 
below). In the Committee's view the measures for the bonuses in respect of 
2009 and 2010 are collectively good indicators of corporate performance that 
should link to long-term shareholder reward. 
d. Annual and Deferred Bonus: implementation
2009 bonus
Bonus payments in respect of 2009 for Simon Pryce and Andrew Wood were 
calculated on the basis of Group ROIC, Group free cash fl ow and the 
achievement of measurable personal objectives.
  The bonus payments in respect of 2009 are included in Table 1 on 
page 57 and refl ect full achievement of the Group free cash fl ow target and 
partial achievement of the Group ROIC target set by the Committee in January 
2009. 25% of the bonus paid to Simon Pryce will be compulsorily deferred 
into BBA Aviation shares. A further 25% may be deferred voluntarily at his 
discretion. Matching will be provided on the deferred shares, whether 
compulsorily or voluntarily deferred, on a one to one basis subject to meeting 
TSR performance criteria over a three-year period. The performance condition 
used for the award of matching shares made in 2009 in relation to the deferred 
2008 bonus is the same total shareholder return condition that applies to the 
2007 , 2008 and 2009 conditional share awards and it is intended that the same 
performance condition will also be used for the award of matching shares 
made in 2010 in relation to the deferred 2009 bonus. This is set out on page 55. 
The BBA 2006 Deferred Bonus Plan, details of which are set out below, governs 
the basis on which such deferral and matching is made. 
2010 bonus 
Bonus payments to the executive directors, Simon Pryce and Mark Hoad, who 
becomes an executive director with eff ect from 29 April 2010, in respect of 
2010 will be 84% based on fi nancial targets (based on the Group's operating 
profi t as to two-thirds and Group free cash fl ow as to one-third) with the 
remaining 16% based on measurable personal objectives. Financial 
performance targets and appropriate personal objectives for 2010 have been 
approved by the Committee.
  After the consultation with the Company's major shareholders 
referred to above, it is intended that the performance condition used for the 
award of matching shares made in 201 1 in relation to the deferred 2010 bonus 
will be based on ROIC. The performance condition in respect of the 2011 
awards of matching shares to be made in relation to any 2010 bonus will be set 
at the time of the award and measured over a three-year performance period. 
Details of the ROIC target relating to the award of matching shares made in 
201 1 in relation to the deferred 2010 bonus will be included in the 2010 Annual 
Report. The BBA 2006 Deferred Bonus Plan, details of which are set out below, 
governs the basis on which such deferral and matching is made.
e. Long-T erm Incentives: policy and implementation
The Remuneration Committee believes that a signifi cant element of executive 
directors' remuneration should be linked to performance-related long-term 
incentives. Details of the current share schemes and the changes proposed to 
the awards currently planned to be made in March 2010 are set out below. 
BBA 2006 Executive Share Option Plan,
BBA 2006 Long-T erm Incentive Plan and
BBA 2006 Deferred Bonus Plan (the 2006 Plans )
The 2006 Plans permit the awards of options, conditional shares and 
matching shares.
  Under the BBA 2006 Executive Share Option Plan, the maximum 
value of options which an executive may be granted in any year is limited to 
three times basic salary, or four times basic salary if the Remuneration 
Committee determines that an executive will not receive an award under the 
2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan in that year. No options were awarded under 
the BBA 2006 Executive Share Option Plan in 2009 but it is planned to grant 
HMRC approved options under the BBA 2006 Executive Share Option Plan in 
2010 to UK taxpayers in conjunction with awards made under the Long-Term 
Incentive Plan. No participant can be granted approved options with a value 
of more than  30,000 (calculated at the date of grant) and any gain that is 
made on the approved options by a UK taxpayer will be subject to the capital 
gains tax regime rather than income tax. The gain will also be exempt from 
both employee and employer National Insurance Contributions. This does 
not aff ect the Company's own tax bill, nor does it increase the overall size of 
the award delivered or likelihood of it vesting. The combination of the 
approved options and conditional share awards under the new arrangements 
will not exceed the economic value of that which would have been delivered 
under the previous arrangements of a conditional share award alone.
  Under the BBA 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan, conditional awards 
of shares are limited in value to one times the executive's basic salary or two 
times basic salary if the Remuneration Committee determines that the 
executive will not be granted options in that year. In 2009 conditional awards 
made to Simon Pryce were one and a half times basic salary, while those made 
to Andrew Wood were one times basic salary. As explained above the 
Remuneration Committee reviewed the remuneration plans in 2009 and as 
part of that review has decided that the conditional awards made to Simon 
Pryce in 2010 will be one times basic salary while those made to other senior 
executives will have a face value of half of basic salary. The Committee 
considers the proposed award levels appropriate, when considered in the 
context of the structure of the proposed total remuneration package 
including the increased element of compulsory deferral of bonus into shares 
forfeitable if the individual leaves within three years, and in line with its policy 
to reward superior performance with potential upper quartile remuneration.
  The conditional awards made in 2006 were subject to three-year 
EPS and total shareholder return (TSR) performance targets. The comparator 
group of companies chosen in 2006 for the TSR element was based on FTSE 
350 listed companies from the industrial transportation, travel and leisure and 
aerospace and defence sectors.
  The conditional awards of shares made in 2007, 2008 and 2009 are 
all also subject to two performance targets over three-year periods. One half 
of each award is subject to a performance target that measures the Company's 
TSR against a comparator group of companies. The other half of each award is 
subject to an adjusted EPS performance target. 
  As explained above, after consultation with the Company's major 
shareholders, it is planned that the performance target for share awards under 
the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (and any associated share options) made 
in 2010 will be solely EPS-based.

The comparator group in respect of the 2006 award of conditional shares was:
Comparator Group 2006 Awards
Arriva Go-Ahead Group QinetiQ
Avis Europe Gondola Holdings Rank Group
BAE Systems Greene King Restaurant Group
BBA Aviation Intercontinental Hotels Group Rolls-Royce Group
British Airways Ladbrokes Smiths Group
Carnival Luminar Stagecoach Group
Chemring Group Meggitt Ultra Electronics 
Cobham Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Holdings
Compass Group Mitchells & Butlers VT Group
EasyJet MyTravel Group Wetherspoon JD
Enterprise Inns (now known as Thomas Cook) Whitbread
First Choice Hols (now National Express Wolverhampton & 
known as TUI Travel) Northgate Dudley
First Group PartyGaming William Hill
Forth Ports Punch Taverns
The Committee reviewed the comparator group used for the 2006 awards in 
2007 and focused the selection of comparator companies on those that 
better refl ect the markets in which BBA Aviation operates. The comparator 
group for the 2007 awards was also used for the 2008 and 2009 awards.
  The comparator group in respect of the 2007 , 2008 and 2009 award 
of conditional shares is:
Comparator Group 2007, 2008 and 2009 Awards
Arriva EasyJet National Express
Avis Europe First Choice Hols  Northgate
BAE Systems (now known as TUI Travel) QinetiQ
BBA Aviation First Group Rolls-Royce Group
British Airways Forth Ports Smiths Group
Carnival Go-Ahead Group Stagecoach Group
Chemring Group Meggitt Ultra Electronics
Cobham MyTravel Group Holdings
 (now known as Thomas Cook) VT Group
If median position is not achieved in the TSR ranking, the TSR part of the award 
will lapse. TSR is measured by reference to the six months before the start of 
the three-year performance period and the three months after the end of the 
performance period and therefore the TSR element cannot usually be tested 
before April of the relevant year. If EPS growth over the performance period is 
less than the increase in the retail price index plus 3% per annum, the EPS part 
of the award will lapse. In neither case will there be retesting. In line with the 
method used to test the satisfaction of performance conditions under 
previous awards, the Remuneration Committee has chosen to have the 
benefi t of the expertise of an independent remuneration consulting fi rm, 
Watson Wyatt Limited (now Towers Watson) to calculate TSR and the external 
auditors will perform certain agreed procedures on the EPS calculation. The 
EPS growth is calculated on a constant exchange rate basis. 
  In 2009 there was a 23% vesting of the conditional share awards 
made in 2006, as 46% of the EPS condition was satisfi ed, while the TSR element 
of those awards lapsed. 
  The conditional share awards made in 2007 will be tested and if 
vesting will be released to participants in March/April 2010, while those made 
in 2008 will be tested and if vesting will be released to participants in March/
April 201 1 and those made in 2009 in March/April 2012. 
  Details of awards made to the executive directors under the 
BBA 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan during the year are set out in Table 3 on 
page 57 , which also shows the vesting of the 2006 awards.
  The Committee is aware that there are a variety of views about the 
use of comparative total shareholder return as a performance measure. While 
adjusted earnings per share growth and comparative total shareholder return 
can be considered to represent a reasonable long-term indication of the 
fi nancial success of the Company, the Committee believes that the two 
performance measures chosen for its long-term incentive schemes for awards 
from 2010 onwards (adjusted earnings per share and return on invested 
capital) are a more representative indication of the long-term fi nancial success 
of the Company, which operates in a range of markets with no clear 
comparator group of companies to measure TSR against.
  The Remuneration Committee is satisfi ed that the award levels 
under both the Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Deferred Bonus Plan are 
not excessive. In making these awards the Remuneration Committee took 
account of the then prevailing remuneration practice and the wish for a 
signifi cant portion of the executive remuneration to be linked to performance, 
as well as the importance of ensuring that high calibre senior management 
are retained and motivated to deliver the business strategy of BBA Aviation.
  The performance conditions in respect of the awards of conditional 
shares made in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 are measured over a three-year 
performance period:
 Percentage of TSR part of 
TSR ranking in comparator group award vesting
At or above 75th percentile 100%
Between median and 75th percentile Pro rata between 25% and 100%
At median 25%
Below median Nil
 Percentage of EPS part of 
EPS growth per annum award vesting
 
At or above RPI increase 100%
plus 7% per annum 
Between RPI plus 3% and 7% per annum Pro rata between 33% and 100%
At RPI increase plus 3% per annum 33%
Less than RPI increase plus 3% per annum Nil
The performance condition in respect of the 2010 awards of conditional 
shares to be made in March 2010 will be set at the time of the award and 
measured over a three-year performance period. Details of the EPS 
performance condition attaching to those awards will be included in the 2010 
Annual Report. However the Committee can confi rm that the EPS vesting 
range for the 2010 award will start at no lower than RPI plus 4% per annum. 
  At present awards made under the Long-Term Incentive Plan and 
awards of matching shares made under the Deferred Bonus Plan lapse when 
an employee leaves the Company, except when the Remuneration 
Committee exercises its discretion to permit the awards to be retained and 
tested at the end of the performance period. The exercise of such discretion is 
guided by the principles (including reduction by a service factor) set out in a 
leaver matrix approved by the Remuneration Committee outlining proposed 
treatment of awards when an employee dies, is made redundant or leaves 
due to injury, disability, retirement or their employing company ceasing to be 
a part of the Group and is always subject to the rules of the relevant share 
scheme. It is intended that this practice will continue to apply to awards made 
in 2010 and beyond.
  In addition it is the intention that any 2010 bonus paid in 201 1 will, to 
the extent the bonus payment is compulsorily deferred into shares under the 
Deferred Bonus Plan, be subject to forfeiture. If at any time before the third 
anniversary of the deferral into shares the employee leaves the Group (other 
than leaving due to injury, disability, retirement, redundancy, death or their 
employing company ceasing to be a part of the Group) then that part of the 
bonus compulsorily deferred into shares and still subject to restrictions would 
be forfeited, subject to the rules of the Deferred Bonus Plan. The forfeiture 
restrictions would be lifted as to a third on each anniversary of the deferral 
into shares. On the third anniversary of the deferral into shares the shares 
would be released to the employee. If an employee left before the third 
anniversary of the award any voluntarily deferred portion of the bonus would 
be retained by the individual.  56
BBA Group 2004 Long-T erm Incentive Plan and Share Option Schemes 
prior to 2005
The BBA Group 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan ) provided for 
awards of options, conditional shares and matching shares. Some options 
granted under the 2004 Plan remain exercisable as do some executive options 
awarded by the Company prior to 2005 which were made under the BBA 
Group 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme which expired in April 2004. Prior 
to March 2002 the BBA Group 1995 Executive Share Appreciation Rights Plan 
was used to facilitate the grant of options to US executives on the same basis 
as the 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme.
BBA Group 2004 Savings-Related Share Option Scheme
Executive directors may be eligible to participate in the BBA Group 2004 
Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all eligible UK 
employees. Options are granted under three or fi ve year SAYE contracts at a 
20% discount to the stock market price at the off er date. The maximum overall 
employee contribution is  250 per month.
Share ownership requirements
As part of its strategy to align shareholders' and directors' interests, the 
Remuneration Committee expects all executive directors to build and 
maintain from shares vesting under the long-term incentive plans a holding 
of shares with a value at least equal to their basic salary.
  In recognition of the forfeiture of potential bonus and other 
incentive awards from his previous employer, on Simon Pryce's joining BBA 
Aviation plc he was made an award of 213,700 shares on 18 June 2007. This 
award (which is neither pensionable nor transferable) was made in accordance 
with the provisions of the Financial Services Authority's Listing Rule 9.4.2 
which permits a company to enter into a bespoke long-term incentive plan 
arrangement without requiring formal shareholder approval in order to 
facilitate the recruitment, in unusual circumstances, of an individual. The 
shares subject to this award have been released in tranches to Simon Pryce, 
with the fi nal tranche, subject to Simon Pryce's continued employment, to be 
released on 11 June 2010. No conditions other than this service condition 
apply to this award. In the event of a change of control of the Company prior 
to all shares being released, all unreleased shares will be released to him 
immediately. This award is included in the fi gures in Table 3 on page 57 .

f. Pension: policy and implementation
Throughout the year under review, Andrew Wood participated in the 
Company's UK Defi ned Benefi t Plan. It is the Committee's policy that the 
bonus of any new director joining the Company's UK pension plans from April 
2000 will not be pensionable and accordingly pensionable earnings for 
Andrew Wood comprise basic salary only.
  Andrew Wood's normal retirement age under the Defi ned Benefi t 
Plan is his 62nd birthday in line with that of existing directors who were 
members of the Defi ned Benefi t Plan when he joined. In the case of death 
before retirement, a contingent widow's pension equal to two-thirds of the 
member's prospective pension is payable. Other dependants' pensions may 
also be paid. The Plan Rules guarantee pension increases in retirement by RPI 
up to 5%. Further discretionary increases are possible if RPI is above 5%.
  Under the pensions legislation that was in force prior to April 2006 
Andrew Wood's pensionable salary was further restricted by the state 
earnings cap. Prior to the changes which came into eff ect on 6 April 2006 
(under the Pensions Act 2004 and Finance Acts 2004 and 2005) the Company 
off ered directors a top up to their pension benefi ts through a Funded 
Unapproved Pension Scheme (FURBS ). The Company's FURBS was closely 
related to the contribution the Company made to the approved Defi ned 
Benefi ts Plan less expenses and any special funding. The rate of contribution 
for Andrew Wood was 36% per annum of pensionable earnings in excess of 
the earnings cap. On 5 April 2006 the FURBS arrangements ceased as a result 
of the Simplifi cation  regulations under the Finance Act 2004.
  From 6 April 2006 revised arrangements applied to all the 
Company's UK pension arrangements as a result of both the Finance Acts 
2004 and 2005 and the Pensions Act 2004. The Company and the Plan Trustee 
in respect of the Defi ned Benefi t Plan agreed that a Notional Earnings Cap  
should be implemented in place of the state earnings cap in order to limit the 
Company's exposure to increases in both Defi ned Benefi t liabilities and 
additional matching Defi ned Contribution contributions. Directors and other 
employees whose earnings were above the Notional Earnings Cap were given 
a choice of receiving either a contribution to the Defi ned Contribution Plan or 
a cash replacement equivalent to the contribution that would have been paid 
to a FURBS. Andrew Wood elected to receive a cash replacement equivalent.
  All the Company's UK Defi ned Benefi t Plans were closed to new 
entrants from April 2002; new employees from that date have the option to 
join a Company-sponsored Stakeholder-style Defi ned Contribution Plan 
provided through an external investment manager. The Company matches 
the employee's contribution in a range of 3% to 7.5% up to the state defi ned 
Earnings Cap (or a notional equivalent).
  Simon Pryce does not participate in the Company's Defi ned 
Contribution Plan. A sum equal to 20% of his basic salary is paid by the 
Company into his Self Invested Personal Pension.

i The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on normal retirement based on service to and pensionable salary at the end of the year.
ii The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with legislative requirements and based on assumptions agreed by the Trustees of the Plan.
iii  The increase in transfer values between 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2009 is as a result of changes in pensionable salary, one year's extra service, and increase in the age 
of the director.
iv The real increase in accrued pension shown has been calculated using a nil figure for inflation, although retail price inflation was negative from September 2008 to September 2009.
USA
Bruce Van Allen (who was a director until he stepped down from the Board with eff ect from 8 January 2009) participates in the Group's Senior Executive Pension 
Plan for North America (the Plan ). Benefi ts under the Plan are based on a fi ve-year averaging of compensation (including bonus payments), less amounts 
received from other Company-sponsored retirement plans in which the executive participates. In the case of death prior to retirement, the accrued benefi t 
reverts to the benefi ciary or benefi ciaries designated by the executive, and is paid in a lump sum.
  The Plan provides that upon achieving age 62, Bruce Van Allen is entitled to receive an unreduced Plan benefi t upon his retirement. In addition, he is 
entitled to a reduced benefi t under the Plan should he elect to take early retirement. Bruce Van Allen also participates in a retirement savings (401(k)) plan 
sponsored by the Group company that employs him. Details of the Company contributions made to the 401(k) plan to his benefi t are set out in Table 6.

1 All accrued pension amounts shown for Bruce Van Allen are lump sums.
2  Bruce Van Allen resigned as a director on 8 January 2009. The accrued pension and transfer value amounts shown are calculated at his date of resignation, and converted to sterling using 
the average US dollar/sterling exchange rate for December 2009.
3  The increase in transfer value and accrued pension between 31 December 2008 and 8 January 2009 is due to a change in the US dollar/sterling exchange rate between 31 December 2008 
and 31 December 2009. Bruce Van Allen did not accrue any additional benefit between these dates.
4. Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration
The non-executive directors each have a letter of appointment which is 
available for inspection by shareholders at each AGM and during normal 
business hours at the Company's registered offi  ce. No compensation would 
be payable for the early termination of the appointment of any non-executive 
director.
  The level of fees for non-executive directors is determined by the 
Board as a whole on the recommendation of the Group Chief Executive. Non-
executive directors' fees were reviewed in December 2009, by reference to 
independent market surveys and benchmarking data, having last been 
reviewed 12 months earlier and, with eff ect from 1 January 2010, the annual 
supplement for the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee was increased 
to  9,500, refl ecting the increased demands placed on the Remuneration 
Committee Chairman. No other non-executive directors' fees were increased 
and the next review will take place at the end of 2010. The annual supplement 
for the Chairman of the Audit Committee is  9,500, that for the Senior 
Independent Director  5,000 and the annual supplement for the CSR 
Responsible Director is  2,500. These supplements refl ect the increased 
commitments and demands placed upon each of the non-executive 
directors in performing their duties on the Board and its principal committees. 
  Details of the non-executive directors' fees for 2009 are set out in 
Table 1 (page 57). 
The dates of appointment or subsequent re-appointment and unexpired 
term of the non-executive directors as at 24 February 2010 are set out below:
  Date of appointment/ Unexpired term as at
