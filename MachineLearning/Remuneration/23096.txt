I am pleased to introduce our Directors' Remuneration Report for 2010, which over the following pages sets 
out the policy, principles and implementation in practice for directors' remuneration, covering each of the 
constituent elements of their remuneration in turn. I trust you will fi nd the format of this year's report easy 
to follow. 
The Committee appreciates the dialogue and support it receives from 
investors and welcomes the constructive feedback that investors have 
been able to provide. As you know from our report last year BBA 
Aviation's Remuneration Committee conducted a major review of the 
structure of the remuneration packages of the Company's senior 
executives at the end of 2009. As part of the review process, the 
Committee discussed with shareholders, representing over 45% of the 
Company's share register, our proposals to better align executive 
remuneration with the strategic objectives of the Group and therefore 
the interests of shareholders. As a consequence of the review a 
number of changes were introduced to the structure and balance of 
the key elements of the Company's remuneration packages in 2010. 
In particular:
 - 
the 2010 annual bonus plan was weighted to focus on the Group's 
operating profits;
 - 
half of any 2010 annual bonus payable to executive directors is 
required to be deferred into the Deferred Bonus Plan;
 - 
the LTIP awards that will be made in 201 1 will have an earnings per 
share performance condition measured over a three-year 
performance period, while the matching awards made under the 
Deferred Bonus Plan in 201 1 will have a return on invested capital 
performance condition, also measured over three years. 
The operation of these is described in this year's report. We believe 
that the changes that were introduced in 2010 and which were 
described fully in last year's annual report are in the best interests of 
both the Company and all its stakeholders. They are designed to 
reward long-term sustainable performance effectively and to 
encourage retention of key employees and the Committee will 
continue to monitor their impact over the coming years. 
In formulating remuneration policy and its implementation, the 
Committee recognises the need for BBA Aviation to compete 
effectively for executive talent in the different markets in which it 
operates. We therefore continue to place high importance on the 
need for remuneration to be competitive while reflecting the business 
strategy of the Group. The annual and long-term incentive 
arrangements are designed to drive business strategy and align our 
executive directors with sustainable value creation for our 
shareholders. We also take into account UK best practice for listed 
companies and understand that this and the views of stakeholders are 
constantly evolving and that diff erent market participants have 
different views of best practice. An example of this is the diff ering 
views on what is the most appropriate use of benchmarking data. 
Following the 2010 AGM, we met some shareholders whose shares 
had been voted against the 2010 Remuneration Report and they have 
confirmed that they too are now satisfied with the Group's 
remuneration structure and practice. 
Mark Hoad was promoted to the Board on his appointment as 
Group Finance Director in April 2010 and this report describes his 
remuneration arrangements in detail for the first time. Andrew Wood 
retired as Group Finance Director on 29 April 2010 and details of his 
remuneration on leaving the Company's employment are also 
contained in this report. 
The Committee looks forward to contributing to the promotion 
of the long-term success of the Company by ensuring that executive 
directors and other designated senior executives are provided with 
appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance that will 
support the growth of the business.

Directors' 
Remuneration 
Report 
continued 
Introduction 
This Report details the Company's remuneration policy and includes 
information on the remuneration of directors for the fi nancial year 
ended 31 December 2010, as well as other specific disclosures required 
such as those relating to directors' shareholdings and other interests. 
Information in this report is unaudited other than that which is 
required to be audited and that is stated as such in the relevant table. 
This report has been prepared taking into account the provisions of 
The Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code) and in 
accordance with the requirements of the Large and Medium-Sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and 
the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. 
This report will be submitted to shareholders for an advisory 
vote at the BBA Aviation AGM in May 201 1. 
1. Remuneration Committee 
Although the Board considers itself ultimately responsible for 
remuneration, policy and practice, it has delegated prime 
responsibility for executive remuneration to the Remuneration 
Committee. The Remuneration Committee is a Committee of the 
Board consisting exclusively of non-executive directors and its 
meetings are minuted by the Group Secretary. No Director is directly 
involved in the determination of, or votes on, any matter relating to 
their own remuneration. 
The Committee is responsible for determining executive 
directors' remuneration (including targets for the annual bonus) and 
reviewing proposals in respect of other senior executives. It also 
determines the targets for longer-term performance-related share 
schemes operated by the Company and oversees any major changes 
in employee benefit structures throughout the Group. Further 
information on the work of the Remuneration Committee and details 
of the Committee's membership are set out on page 71. 
During the year the Committee received advice from Towers 
Watson as the Committee's appointed remuneration advisers. In 2010 
Towers Watson provided benchmarking information relating to the 
executive directors and other senior executives. In addition, Towers 
Watson provided general advice in relation to remuneration strategy, 
background information about remuneration trends and calculations 
of total shareholder return in connection with the BBA 2006 Deferred 
Bonus and Long-Term Incentive Plans. 
Towers Watson also provides advice to the Company in respect 
of individuals outside the terms of reference of the Remuneration 
Committee, including advice on human resource policies, 
benchmarking information including on non-executive directors' fees, 
advice on healthcare and benefits provision, pension administration 
and actuarial services. Towers Watson is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and is committed to that Group's 
voluntary code of practice for remuneration consultants in the UK. This 
includes processes for ensuring integrity and objectivity of advice to 
the Remuneration Committee. 
During the year, the Committee also consulted the Chairman, 
the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, the Group HR 
Director and the Group Secretary in connection with the Committee's 
work. It is expected that the Committee will wish to continue to 
consult with them in 2011 and that they will continue to be invited 
to attend Committee meetings. 
2. Remuneration Policy 
The Committee believes that a significant element of executive 
directors' remuneration should be linked to performance-related 
long-term incentives. 
The Group's remuneration policy is intended to ensure that the 
remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives 
properly reflects their duties and responsibilities and is suffi  cient to 
attract, retain and motivate high calibre senior management capable 
collectively of delivering the goals of the Company. 
The policy of the Committee is to provide base salaries that are 
positioned around mid-market when compared with relevant local 
market data to ensure that it can retain and recruit suitable talent. In 
determining short and long-term incentives, reference is made to the 
wider, regional and global markets. 
The Remuneration Committee believes that a significant 
element of executive directors' remuneration should be linked to 
performance-related long-term incentives and that alignment 
between Group strategy and the remuneration of its senior executives 
is critical. 
This policy is reflected in the Deferred Bonus Plan where the 
Matching Awards will only vest if demanding Return on Invested 
Capital (ROIC) targets are met (see below for more detail). The 
compulsory requirement to defer bonus ties the long-term value of 
executive remuneration closely to the Company's performance. 
Total executive remuneration is structured to create the 
potential for upper quartile rewards based on the delivery of superior 
performance with a significant proportion of variable pay subject to 
stretching performance targets. The Committee believes that the 
remuneration packages of the executive directors contain a suitable 
balance of directly performance-related remuneration which links 
both the short-term financial performance of the Group and long-
term shareholder returns with the executives' total remuneration. 
In connection with the ABI Responsible Investment Disclosure 
Guidelines, the Remuneration Committee confirms that it considers 
corporate performance on environmental, social and governance 
issues when setting the remuneration of executive directors. The 
Committee also believes that the incentive structure for senior 
management does not raise environmental, social or governance risks 
by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour and is compatible 
with the Company's risk policies and systems. 
To ensure that the Company offers the best available incentives 
to enhance shareholder value, the Committee assesses the constituent 
elements of the remuneration of the executive directors: 
Fixed elements: 
- 
salary, benefits and service contract 
- 
pension 
Variable elements 
- 
annual bonus 
- 
deferred bonus plan 
- 
long-term incentive plan and executive share option plan 
In determining remuneration, consideration is given to reward levels 
throughout the organisation as well as in the external employment 
market. The Committee aims to reward employees fairly based on 
their role, their experience, their performance and salary levels in the 
wider market. 
The remuneration policy described in this report will be kept 
under review, but the current intention is that the policy should 
continue to apply in future fi nancial years.

The following chart shows the balance between fixed and variable 
elements of the remuneration package for executive directors. The 
upper bar shows the position (labelled target) if half of the maximum 
potential variable remuneration was received. The lower bar shows 
the position (labelled stretch) if all of the maximum potential variable 
remuneration was received. The targets for variable remuneration are 
strongly aligned to the Company's strategic objective of creating 
long-term sustainable value and the proportion of total remuneration 
that is variable remuneration increases as more of the stretching 
performance conditions and targets are achieved. 
Remuneration mix

broadly in line with the salary increases given to those in the wider 
employee workforce who have performed strongly. In relation to Mark 
Hoad the Remuneration Committee agreed (with eff ect from 
1 January 201 1) a 10% increase in base salary to  275,000 reflecting the 
progression of his experience and performance in his new role. 
In addition to base salary, executive directors receive traditional 
benefits, principally a company car allowance, private medical 
insurance, retirement and death in service benefits. 
It is the Committee's policy to make new executive director 
appointments with a rolling service agreement which can be 
terminated by the Company on giving 12 months' notice and this 
policy was applied when Mark Hoad joined the Board in April 2010. 
Set out below are the contractual notice periods for executive 
directors who served during the year. 
Months' Notice 
Contract By To 
Date Company Company 
Mark Hoad: target 
stretch 
0 25 50 75 100 
Fixed remuneration: includes base salary, benefits and contribution
 
to pension
 
Variable remuneration: annual bonus

  Variable remuneration: long-term incentives
 
The actual value of performance-related incentives will depend on 
actual performance. If the respective minimum performance 
conditions are not met then the incentive will have no value and if the 
share-based incentives vest, then the share price of the Company at 
that time will determine the actual value on vesting of such incentives. 
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the award levels under 
both the Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Deferred Bonus Plan are 
not excessive. In making awards under each of these plans the 
Remuneration Committee took account of the then prevailing 
remuneration practice and the wish for a significant portion of 
the executive remuneration to be linked to performance, as well as 
the importance of ensuring that high calibre senior management 
are  retained and motivated to deliver the business strategy of 
BBA Aviation. 
The Committee believes that the two performance measures 
chosen for its long-term incentive schemes for awards from 2010 
onwards - earnings per share (EPS) and ROIC - are the best available 
indication of the long-term financial success of the Company, due to 
the lack of an effective comparator group, and are well aligned with 
the long-term interests of shareholders. 
3. Executive Directors' Remuneration 
a. Salary, Benefits and Service Contract 
Salary reflects the role and contribution to the Company of the 
executives in terms of skills and experience. 
Base salaries are reviewed annually by reference to comparator 
groups selected on the basis of comparable business size, geographic 
spread and business focus. Individual salary decisions take into 
account market conditions, business performance, personal 
contribution and the level of pay awards and conditions elsewhere in 
the Group. 
Following a review at the end of 2010 the Remuneration 
Committee approved (with effect from 1 January 201 1) a 3.2% increase 
in base salary to  542,000 for Simon Pryce, a percentage increase 
Simon Pryce 23/04/07 12 12 
Andrew Wood* 13/02/01 12 6 
Mark Hoad 29/04/10 12 6 
*A Wood retired as a director on 29 April 2010 
In the event of early termination, the Remuneration Committee will, 
within legal constraints, determine the approach to be taken 
according to the circumstances of each individual case, taking account 
of the departing director's obligation to mitigate his loss. In certain 
circumstances, and other than for termination for non-performance, 
the executive directors may receive compensation upon early 
termination of a contract which could, depending on the 
circumstances at the relevant time, amount to up to one year's 
remuneration based on base salary, bonus, benefits in kind and 
pension rights during the notice period. Any payment of bonus in 
these circumstances would depend on the facts at the time as there 
are no guaranteed bonus provisions. 
Table 1 (on page 81) sets out details of the executive 
directors' salaries. 
b. Annual Bonus 
The annual bonus provides focus on the delivery of stretching 
and strategically aligned annual financial targets and 
personal objectives. 
The Company's annual bonus plan seeks to provide executive 
directors, members of the Executive Management Committee and 
senior managers with the opportunity to increase overall 
remuneration levels for achieving demanding performance targets. 
2010 Annual Bonus arrangements 
The structure for the 2010 annual bonus included both fi nancial and 
personal objectives and provided a maximum bonus opportunity for 
executive directors of up to 125% of salary: 105% being based on 
financial objectives (with a maximum of 35% for achievement of 
Group free cash flow targets and 70% for achievement of Group 
operating profit targets) and the remaining 20% based on measurable 
personal objectives. For the annual bonus that will be paid in 2011 in 
respect of the year ended 31 December 2010, 50% of any bonus paid 
to Simon Pryce and 50% of any bonus paid to Mark Hoad will be 
compulsorily deferred into BBA Aviation shares under the Deferred 
Bonus Plan described below. A further 50% is eligible to be deferred 
voluntarily at the director's discretion.

Report

The annual bonus payments in respect of 2010 are included in table 1 
on page 81. Both Simon Pryce and Mark Hoad received 70.6% of their 
salary in respect of the performance against the fi nancial objectives 
set (35.6% in respect of partial achievement of Group operating profit 
targets, 35% in respect of full achievement of Group free cash flow 
targets). Andrew Wood also received 70.6% of his salary in respect of 
achievement of financial objectives and 20% in respect of 
achievement of personal objectives, prorated to reflect his retirement 
at the end of April 2010. Simon Pryce received 17% and Mark Hoad 
received 19% in respect of achievement of their respective personal 
objectives. 
201 1 Annual Bonus arrangements 
The structure for the 2011 annual bonus follows that of the 2010 
annual bonus. Of the maximum bonus opportunity for executive 
directors of up to 125% of salary: 105% will be based on fi nancial 
objectives (with a maximum of 35% for achievement of Group free 
cash flow targets and 70% for achievement of Group operating profit 
targets) and the remaining 20% based on measurable personal 
objectives. As was the case for the 2010 annual bonus, 50% of any 
bonus paid to Simon Pryce and Mark Hoad in 2012 in respect of the 
2011 annual bonus will be compulsorily deferred into BBA Aviation 
shares under the Deferred Bonus Plan described below. A further 50% 
will be eligible to be deferred voluntarily at the director's discretion. 
While the Committee had concluded in 2009 that the changed 
economic environment at that time meant that it was appropriate to 
increase the weighting given to cash flow in the 2009 annual bonus, in 
2010 and again in 201 1 the Committee has concluded that a significant 
weighting on operating profit targets is now appropriate in the 
current economic environment. 
c. Longer-term performance incentives - Deferred Bonus Plan 
The structure of deferred bonuses, paid in shares, places increased 
focus on long-term alignment with shareholder value creation and 
encourages the retention of key employees. 
The Remuneration Committee believes that it is important to 
encourage personal investment and ongoing shareholding in BBA 
Aviation plc. The Company has had a deferred bonus plan since 2006 
and this plan enables a significant proportion of executive directors' 
remuneration to be deferred and linked to performance-related long-
term incentives. The structure of deferred bonuses, paid in shares 
under this plan, places increased focus on long-term alignment 
with shareholders' interests, reinforces the critical importance of 
maintaining performance and aids retention. 
A fixed percentage of the annual bonus awarded to executive 
directors and other senior management has to be deferred into BBA 
Aviation's shares for a period of three years. Executive directors and 
other senior management may voluntarily defer a further percentage 
of their annual bonus into shares held under the terms of the Deferred 
Bonus Plan. The Company makes a matching award of shares (on a 
one to one basis) calculated by reference to the total amount of bonus 
deferred (whether voluntarily or compulsorily). These matching 
awards are subject to a performance condition that is tested at the end 
of the three-year performance period and the awards will lapse if the 
condition is not met. 
The overall effect is to defer the payment of at least 50% of the annual 
bonus earned by executive directors as shown by the timeline below: 
Timeline for 2010 annual bonus: 
2010 Annual bonus targets set 
2011 
2012

Year 2 of deferred 2010 bonus 
2014 Deferred 2010 bonus released in 
shares and depending on performance 
condition being satisfied related 
matching shares released 
The performance condition that was used for the matching awards 
that were granted in 2010 in relation to the 2009 annual bonus was 
comparative TSR and this performance condition too will be measured 
over a three-year performance period. Further details of that condition 
are shown on page 79. As disclosed in last year's remuneration report, 
the Committee believes that it is appropriate to move to the more 
relevant Company financial measure of ROIC in respect to the matching 
awards that will be made under the Deferred Bonus Plan in March 201 1. 
It is intended that the ROIC performance condition used for the 
matching award in 201 1, and measured over a three-year performance 
period, will result in full vesting if average pretax ROIC over the 
three-year period is 11.5%, with 25% of the award vesting if average 
pretax ROIC over the three years is 10% and pro-rata vesting between 
25% and 100% for average pretax ROIC between 10% and 11.5%. 
As ROIC for the first half of 2010 was 8.8% and ROIC for the full year was 
below 10% the Committee is of the view that this proposed target 
is suitably stretching. 
For the 2010 bonus paid in 201 1 and for future bonuses, if at any 
time before the third anniversary of the deferral into shares the 
employee leaves the Group (other than due to injury, disability, 
retirement, redundancy, death or their employing company ceasing to 
be a part of the Group) then that part of the bonus compulsorily 
deferred into shares and still subject to restrictions would be forfeited, 
subject to the rules of the Deferred Bonus Plan. The forfeiture 
restrictions would in general be lifted as to a third on each anniversary 
of the deferral into shares. On the third anniversary of the deferral into 
shares, the shares would be released to the employee. If an employee 
left before the third anniversary any voluntarily deferred portion of the 
bonus would be retained by the individual, though the related 
matching award would usually lapse on their departure. 
The Committee considers the award levels under the Deferred 
Bonus Plan to be appropriate, when viewed in the context of the 
structure of the total remuneration package including the increased 
element of compulsory deferral of bonus forfeitable if the individual 
leaves within three years, and to support and reinforce its policy to 
reward sustained and superior performance with potential upper 
quartile remuneration.

d. Longer-term performance incentives - 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and 
Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP) 
The Company's longer-term performance incentives reward 
achievement of longer-term strategic objectives and provide 
the  executive directors with accountability for the delivery of 
that strategy. 
LTIP 
Under the LTIP , conditional awards of shares can be made of up to one 
times the executive's base salary or up to two times base salary if the 
Remuneration Committee determines that the executive will not be 
granted options in that year. In 2010, conditional awards made to 
Simon Pryce were one times base salary, while those made to Mark 
Hoad were half times base salary. This approach will be continued for 
the awards planned to be made in 201 1. 
The conditional share awards made under the LTIP in 2007 
lapsed during 2010 as neither the TSR nor the EPS element of the 
performance conditions was satisfied. Details of awards made in 2010 
to the executive directors under the LTIP are set out in table 3 on 
page 82, which also shows the lapsing of the 2007 awards. 
ESOP 
Under the ESOP, the maximum value of options which an executive 
may be granted in any year is limited to three times base salary, or four 
times base salary if the Remuneration Committee determines that an 
executive will not receive an award under the LTIP in that year. There is 
no intention to grant unapproved options under the ESOP . 
In March 2010, a total of 201,916 HMRC approved options were 
granted under the ESOP to eleven UK taxpayers in conjunction with 
awards made under the LTIP . The combination of the award of HMRC 
approved options and the awards made under the LTIP did not exceed 
the economic value of that which would have been delivered under 
the previous arrangements of a conditional share award alone. 
The number of HMRC approved options granted to Simon Pryce in 
March 2010 is shown in table 4 on page 82. No participant can be 
granted approved options with a value of more than  30,000 
(calculated at the date of grant) and any gain that is made on the 
approved options by a UK taxpayer will be subject to the capital gains 
tax regime rather than income tax, but this does not aff ect the 
Company's own tax bill. 
The comparator group in respect of the TSR performance condition

TSR is measured by reference to the six months before the start of the 
three-year performance period and the three months after the end of 
the performance period and therefore the TSR element of any 
performance condition cannot usually be tested before April of the 
relevant year. 
The conditional share awards made in 2008 will be tested and if 
vesting will be released to participants in March/April 201 1, while those 
made in 2009 will be tested and if vesting will be released to participants 
in March/April 2012 and those made in 2010 (having only an EPS 
condition), if vesting, will be released to participants in March 201 3. 
The TSR performance conditions in respect of the awards of 
conditional shares made in 2007, 2008 and 2009 and the matching 
awards made in 2008, 2009 and 2010 are measured over a three-year 
performance period: 
Percentage of TSR part of 
TSR ranking in comparator group award vesting 
At or above 75th percentile 100%
 
Between median and 75th percentile Pro rata between 25% and 100%
 
At median 25%
 
Below median Nil
 
Performance conditions and other terms 
The conditional awards of shares made in 2008 and 2009 under the 
LTIP are subject to two performance conditions measured over three-
year periods. One half of each award is subject to a performance 
condition that measures the Company's TSR against a comparator 
group of companies. The other half of each award is subject to an 
adjusted EPS performance condition. 
After consultation with the Company's major shareholders in 
2009, it was agreed that the performance condition for share awards 
under the LTIP (and any associated share options) made in 2010 would 
be solely EPS-based. 
The EPS performance condition in respect of awards of conditional 
shares made in 2007, 2008 and 2009 are measured over a three-year 
performance period: 
Percentage of EPS part of 
EPS growth per annum award vesting 
At or above retail price index (RPI) 
increase plus 7% per annum 100% 
Between RPI plus 3% and  Pro rata between

Directors' 
Remuneration 
Report 
continued 
The EPS performance condition in respect of the award of conditional 
shares made in 2010 and any award of conditional shares to be made 
under the LTIP in 2011 is measured over a three-year performance 
period: 
EPS growth per annum Percentage of award vesting 
At or above RPI increase plus 
8% per annum 100% 
Between RPI plus 4% and  Pro rata between 
8% per annum 33% and 100% 
At RPI increase plus 4% per annum 33% 
Less than RPI increase plus 
4% per annum Nil 
In setting this EPS performance condition the Committee took into 
account both the growth prospects in the current market conditions 
and the wider economic environment including infl ation trends. 
The details of the exact numbers of the awards to be made in 
2011 are not known at the date of this report, as they are calculated 
based on the share price at the time of the award, which is expected to 
be in March 201 1. 
There is no retesting of performance conditions. 
All unvested share scheme awards made since 2010 to Executive 
Management Committee members are subject to provisions 
concerning cancellation and reduction in the event of material fi nancial 
mis-statement. 
In line with the method used to test the satisfaction of 
performance conditions under previous awards, the Remuneration 
Committee has chosen to have the benefit of the expertise of 
an independent remuneration consulting firm, Towers Watson, to 
calculate TSR and the external auditors will perform certain agreed 
procedures on the EPS calculation. The EPS growth is calculated on a 
constant exchange rate basis. 
At present, awards made under either the LTIP or ESOP or the 
Deferred Bonus Plan lapse (subject to the rules of the relevant share 
scheme) when an employee leaves the Company, except when the 
Remuneration Committee exercises its discretion to permit awards (in 
part or whole) to be retained and tested at the end of the performance 
period. The exercise of such discretion is guided by the principles 
(including reduction by a service factor) set out in a leaver matrix 
approved by the Remuneration Committee outlining proposed 
treatment of awards when an employee dies, is made redundant or 
leaves due to injury, disability, retirement or their employing company 
ceasing to be a part of the Group and is always subject to the rules of 
the relevant share scheme. It is intended that this practice will continue 
to apply to awards made (under the LTIP, the ESOP and also the 
Deferred Bonus Plan) in 201 1 and beyond. 
BBA Group longer-term incentive plans prior to 2005 
The BBA Group 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan) 
provided for awards of options, conditional shares and matching 
shares. Some options granted under the 2004 Plan remain exercisable 
as do some executive options awarded by the Company prior to 2005 
which were made under the BBA Group 1994 Executive Share Option 
Scheme which expired in April 2004. Prior to March 2002 the BBA 
Group 1995 Executive Share Appreciation Rights Plan was used to 
facilitate the grant of options to US executives on the same basis as the 
1 994 Executive Share Option Scheme. 
BBA Group 2004 Savings-Related Share Option Scheme 
Executive directors may be eligible to participate in the BBA Group 
2004 Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all 
eligible UK employees. Options are granted under three or five-year 
SAYE contracts at a 20% discount to the stock market price at the off er 
date. The maximum overall employee contribution is  250 per month. 
Share ownership requirements 
As part of its strategy to align shareholders' and directors' interests, the 
Remuneration Committee expects all executive directors to build and 
maintain from shares vesting under the long-term incentive plans a 
holding of shares with a value at least equal to their base salary. 
In recognition of the forfeiture of potential bonus and other 
incentive awards from his previous employer, on Simon Pryce's joining 
BBA Aviation plc he was made an award of 213,700 shares on 18 June 
2007. This award which was neither pensionable nor transferable was 
made in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Services 
Authority's Listing Rule 9.4.2 which permits a company to enter into a 
bespoke long-term incentive plan arrangement without requiring 
formal shareholder approval in order to facilitate the recruitment of an 
individual in unusual circumstances. The shares subject to this award 
were released in tranches to Simon Pryce, with the fi nal tranche being 
released on 1 1 June 2010 and these shares are included in the figures 
in table 3 on page 82. 
Performance Charts 
The charts on page 81 show the Company's total shareholder return 
over the last five fi nancial years compared with the equivalent 
information for the FTSE 350 Industrial Transportation sector which the 
Committee considers, for the purposes of the regulatory requirement 
to include such charts in the report, to be a suitable broad-based equity 
market index of which the Company is a constituent. The graph on the 
left shows the annual change in total shareholder return for the 
Company and the index, while the graph on the right shows the 
cumulative change in total shareholder return from January 2006.

16
/21p share was 170.1p. 
iii	 Matching shares awarded in 2008, 2009 and during the year are subject to the performance conditions set out on page 79. T he purchase price of a BBA Aviation plc ordinary 29

iv	 Under normal circumstances, a Linked Award will only vest to the extent needed to provide suffi cient funds to meet the exercise price of an Approved Share Option under the 2006 Executive Share 
Option Plan (as described on page 79). The numbers stated in table 3 will be the maximum number of shares that will vest under the Linked Award which is linked to the number (noted in table 4 
below) of Approved Share Options granted under the 2006 Executive Share Option Plan. Fewer shares will vest under the Linked Award if the share price increases between the date of grant and 
vesting as fewer shares will be required to cover the exercise price of the Approved Share Option.

e. Pension: policy and implementation 
All the Company's UK Defined Benefit Plans were closed to new 
entrants from April 2002; new employees from that date have the 
option to join a Company-sponsored stakeholder-style Defi ned 
Contribution Plan provided through an external investment manager. 
Simon Pryce does not participate in that Defi ned Contribution 
Plan and a sum equal to 20% of his base salary is paid by the Company 
into his own Self Invested Personal Pension. 
Mark Hoad does participate in the Company-sponsored 
stakeholder-style Defined Contribution Plan and the Company pays a 
sum equal to 20% of his base salary into that plan. 
Andrew Wood, who had joined the Board in January 2001, 
participated in the Company's UK Defined Benefit Plan (Plan) between 
the start of the year and his retirement as a director on 29 April 2010. 
It has been the Committee's policy since April 2000 that the bonus of 
any new director joining the Company's Plan would not be 
pensionable and accordingly pensionable earnings for Andrew Wood 
comprised salary only. 
Andrew Wood's normal retirement age under the Defi ned 
Benefit Plan was his 62nd birthday in line with that of existing directors 
who were members of the Defined Benefit Plan when he joined. In 
the case of death before retirement, a contingent widow's pension 
equal to two-thirds of the member's prospective pension would have 
been payable. Other dependants' pensions may also be paid. The Plan 
rules guarantee pension increases in retirement by the increase in RPI 
up to 5% on pension accrued before 1 March 2010 and by the increase 
in RPI up to 2.5% on pension accrued after 1 March 2010. However, at

retirement Andrew Wood opted to exchange part of his headline rate 
of pension for guaranteed annual increases of 5% on the part of his 
pension accrued before 1 March 2010. 
Under the pensions legislation that was in force prior to April 
2006 Andrew Wood's pensionable salary was further restricted by the 
state earnings cap. Prior to the changes which came into eff ect on 
6 April 2006 the Company off ered directors a top up to their pension 
benefits through a Funded Unapproved Pension Scheme (FURBS). 
The  Company's FURBS contributions were closely related to the 
contribution the Company made to the approved Defi ned Benefi ts 
Plan less expenses and any special funding. The rate of contribution for 
Andrew Wood was 36% per annum of pensionable earnings in excess 
of the earnings cap. On 5 April 2006 the FURBS arrangements ceased as 
a result of the Simplifi cation  regulations under the Finance Act 2004. 
From 6 April 2006 revised arrangements applied to all the Company's 
UK pension arrangements as a result of both the Finance Acts 2004 and 
2005 and the Pensions Act 2004. The Company and the Plan Trustee in 
respect of the Defined Benefit Plan agreed that a Notional Earnings 
Cap  should be implemented in place of the state earnings cap in order 
to limit the Company's exposure to increases in both Defi ned Benefi t 
liabilities and additional matching Defined Contribution contributions. 
Directors and other employees whose earnings were above the 
Notional Earnings Cap were given a choice of receiving either a 
contribution to the Defined Contribution Plan or a cash replacement 
equivalent to the contribution that would have been paid to a FURBS. 
Andrew Wood elected to receive a cash replacement equivalent.

Additional notes 
i 	 The pension entitlement shown at 31 December 2009 is that which would have been paid annually on normal retirement based on service to and pensionable salary at 31 December 2009. 
ii	 The pension entitlement shown at 31 December 2010 is the actual pension in payment at that date, following Andrew Wood's retirement from the Company on 30 April 2010. 
iii	 The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with legislative requirements and based on assumptions agreed by the trustees of the Plan. 
iv	 The decrease in transfer values between 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2010 is largely as a result of Andrew Wood electin g under the rules of the Plan to receive a portion of his pension as a 
pension commencement lump sum of  136,579 at retirement, in return for receiving a lower pension in payment. 
4. Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration 
The non-executive directors each have a letter of appointment which is 
available for inspection by shareholders at each AGM and during 
normal business hours at the Company's registered offi  ce. No 
compensation would be payable for the early termination of the 
appointment of any non-executive director. 
The level of fees for non-executive directors is determined by the 
Board as a whole on the recommendation of the Group Chief 
Executive. Non-executive directors' fees were reviewed in December 
2010, by reference to independent market surveys and benchmarking 
data, having last been reviewed 12 months earlier when the basic fees 
for non-executive directors were not increased. With eff ect from 
1 January 2011 the non-executive directors' basic fee was increased 
from  42,000 to  45,000, with the fee paid to the Chairman being 
increased from  178,500 to  185,000. The annual supplements remain 
the same: that for the Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees is  9,500, that for the Senior Independent Director  5,000 
and the annual supplement for the CSR Responsible Director is  2,500. 
These supplements reflect the increased commitments and demands 
placed upon each of the non-executive directors in performing their 
duties on the Board and its principal committees. 
Details of the non-executive directors' fees for 2010 are set out in table 1 
(page 81 ). 
The dates of appointment or subsequent re-appointment and 
unexpired term of the non-executive directors as at 1 March 2011 are 
set out below:

Hansel T ookes 19/02/2010 23 months 
The non-executive directors do not participate in the Company's
