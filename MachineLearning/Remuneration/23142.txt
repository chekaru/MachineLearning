 Directors' Report   65
This excellent performance has been reflected in the Group's share 
price which increased by 158% between January 2009 and 
December 2011, a very strong performance when compared to the 
FTSE 250 or the S&P 500, which increased by 59% and 39% 
respectively over the same period. 
The Committee believes that the Group's remuneration plans 
have been effective in supporting this positive performance over 
the past three years.
In 2012, in order to support continued delivery of the Group's 
strategic objectives, the Remuneration Committee intends to make 
minor changes to aspects of the Group remuneration plans as follows:
  
setting stretching absolute (rather than RPI plus) three year EPS 
growth targets that reflect the economic environment, market 
expectations and the Group's strategic plan. For the Long-term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards to be made in 201 2, the performance 
targets for annual growth in EPS will be 6% for minimum vesting 
and 1 2% for maximum vesting; and 
  
increasing the average annual return on invested capital (ROIC) 
targets for matching awards under the Deferred Bonus Plan from 
10-1 1.5% to 10.5-1 2%. 
Both the EPS and ROIC targets will continue to be reviewed annually 
at the time of each new award.
The Remuneration Committee has concluded that the 
voluntary deferral element of the Deferred Bonus Plan is not an 
effective performance or retention incentive. In the context of 
continuing to focus on long-term growth in EPS, the Committee has 
therefore decided that for the 2012 short- term incentive plan the 
opportunity will not be offered in 2013 to voluntarily defer a portion 
of that incentive and to receive an associated matching award. The 
Committee has also decided that the size of LTIP award to be made 
in 2012 will increase from one times base salary to one and a half 
times base salary for the Chief Executive and from half to three-
quarters of base salary for the Group Finance Director. This remains 
well below the maximum award permitted under the rules of the 
LTIP of two times base salary. The requirement for compulsory 
deferral of 50% of any short-term incentive earned will remain in 
place for executive directors.
The Remuneration Committee believes that in the current 
environment, these changes will increase the effectiveness of the 
Group's incentive arrangements in supporting future delivery of the 
Group's strategic objectives. 
Mark Harper
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
1 March 201 2
I am pleased to introduce our Directors' Remuneration Report for 
2011, which sets out the Group's policy on directors' remuneration 
and how that has been applied during the year. 
In formulating and implementing remuneration policy, the 
Committee is aware of the constantly evolving and differing views of 
stakeholders and of the variety of approaches that are perceived as 
best practice for UK listed companies in the area of executive 
remuneration. While taking this background into account, the 
Committee focuses on and prioritises the creation of effective 
executive compensation structures specific to BBA Aviation that : 
  
are closely aligned with, and reward the delivery of, the Group's 
long-term strategy for sustainable value creation; and 
  
ensure that the Group can compete effectively for executive 
talent in the international markets in which it operates. 
The Committee engages in proactive dialogue with its investors on 
remuneration matters and appreciates their support in setting 
remuneration plans that meet these two objectives.
In 2011, the Group delivered organic revenue growth of 5% 
and underlying operating profit improvement of 16%, thus 
achieving continued growth in profitability in a relatively low growth 
environment. (Organic revenue growth provides a measure of the 
underlying growth of the business as it is measured excluding the 
impact of foreign currency and fuel price fluctuations, and any 
contribution from acquisitions and disposals.)
201 1 saw a continuation of BBA Aviation's strong absolute and 
relative financial performance, following on from the organic 
revenue growth of 4% and the underlying profit improvement, of 
10% in 2010. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in 201 1 was 29.0 , up 
from 27 .3  in 2010 and 22.8  in 2009. Net debt at 31 December 2009 
was $630.5 million and by 31 December 2011 had been reduced to 
$403.6 million, with a resultant reduction in leverage from 2.9 times 
in 2009 to 1.5 times in 201 1. 
Some financial highlights for 2011, 2010 and 2009 are shown 
on page 67 .

Remuneration summary
The Committee believes that driving improvements in the Group's return on invested capital (the performance condition for the Deferred Bonus 
Plan) and earnings per share (the performance condition for the Long-term Incentive Plan) are the principal mechanisms for creating sustainable 
shareholder value.

Remuneration mix
The following charts show the balance between fixed and variable elements of the remuneration package for each of the executive directors 
and also for the average of the Executive Management Committee members who are not Board members. The upper bar on each chart shows 
the position (labelled target) if half of the maximum potential variable remuneration was received. The lower bar on each chart shows the 
position (labelled stretch) if all of the maximum potential variable remuneration was received. As more stretching performance is achieved, so 
the proportion of variable to fixed remuneration increases.
The actual value of performance-related incentives will depend on actual performance. If the respective minimum performance 
conditions are not met then the incentive will have no value and if the share-based incentives vest, then the share price of the Company at that 
time will determine the actual value on vesting of such incentives.
The targets for variable remuneration include operating profit, free cash flow, EPS and ROIC, all of which strongly align to the Company's 
strategic objective of creating long-term sustainable value.

During the year, the Committee also consulted the Chairman, the 
Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, the Group HR 
Director and the Group Secretary in connection with the Committee's 
work. It is expected that the Committee will wish to continue to 
consult with them in 2012 and that they will continue to be invited to 
attend Committee meetings when appropriate.
2. Remuneration Policy 
The Group's remuneration policy is intended to align executive 
compensation structure and opportunity closely with delivery of the 
Group's long-term strategy for sustainable value creation. The 
executive compensation structure reflects the duties and 
responsibilities of the executive directors and other senior executives 
and is intended to ensure that the Group can compete effectively for 
executive talent capable of delivering the Group's challenging goals in 
the international markets in which the Group operates.
The Committee believes that total executive remuneration 
should be structured to create the potential for upper quartile rewards 
based on the delivery of superior performance; that total 
remuneration should include a suitable balance of fixed and variable 
remuneration; and that a material element of executive remuneration 
should be deferred and should be linked to the long-term 
performance and delivery of the Group's strategy for sustainable value 
creation.
The Committee also believes that the variable element of the 
remuneration packages of executive directors should be performance-
related, linking both short-term financial performance of the Group 
and long-term shareholder returns with the executives' total 
remuneration. 
In connection with the ABI Responsible Investment Disclosure 
Guidelines the Remuneration Committee confirms that it considers 
corporate performance on environmental, social and governance 
issues when setting the remuneration of executive directors. The 
Committee also believes that the incentive structure for senior 
management does not raise environmental, social or governance risks 
by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour and is compatible 
with the Company's risk policies and systems. 
In determining remuneration, consideration is given to reward 
levels throughout the organisation as well as in the external 
employment market. The Committee aims to reward employees fairly 
based on their role, their experience, their delivery and performance, 
and salary levels in the countries in which the employees are working. 
The remuneration policy described in this Report will be kept 
under review, but the current intention is that the policy should 
continue to apply in future financial years.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the award levels 
under both the Long-term Incentive Plan and the Deferred Bonus Plan 
are not excessive. In making awards under each of these plans the 
Remuneration Committee took account of the then prevailing 
remuneration practice and the wish for a significant portion of the 
executive remuneration to be linked to longer-term performance, as 
well as the importance of ensuring that high calibre senior 
management are retained and motivated to deliver the business 
strategy of BBA Aviation. The Remuneration Committee is also satisfied 
that such awards will only vest if the Group delivers on its strategic 
objectives of sustainable value creation. The charts on pages 18, 19 
and 67 show the success to date of the executive management in 
delivering revenue and earnings growth as well as share price growth. 
Introduction
This Report outlines the Company's remuneration policy and practice 
for the financial year ended 31 December 201 1, as well as other specific 
disclosures required such as those relating to directors' shareholdings 
and other interests. 
Information in this report is unaudited other than that which is 
required to be audited and that is stated as such in the relevant table. 
This Report has been prepared taking into account the provisions of 
the UK's Corporate Governance Code (the Code) and in accordance 
with the requirements of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
This Report will be submitted to shareholders for an advisory 
vote at the BBA Aviation AGM in April 201 2.
As previously announced, the Board decided to change the 
Group's presentation currency from sterling to US dollars with effect 
from the 2011 year end results. In the narrative of this Report all 
amounts are shown in sterling as they are in the parent company 
financial statements of BBA Aviation plc for the year ended 
31 December 201 1. US dollar amounts for total remuneration (for 201 1 
and 2010) are shown in the notes to table 1 on page 73.
1. Remuneration Committee
Although the Board considers itself ultimately responsible for 
remuneration policy, it has delegated prime responsibility for 
implementing that policy as it relates to senior executive remuneration 
to the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee is a 
Committee of the Board consisting exclusively of non-executive 
directors and its meetings are minuted by the Group Secretary.  
No director is directly involved in the determination of, or votes on, any 
matter relating to their own remuneration.
The Committee is responsible for:
  
determining executive directors' remuneration; 
  
setting targets for the short-term and longer-term incentive plans 
and performance-related share plans; 
  
reviewing proposals in respect of other senior executives; and
  
overseeing any major changes in employee incentive structures 
throughout the Group. 
Further information on the work of the Remuneration 
Committee and details of the Committee's membership are set out in 
the Directors' Corporate Governance Statement on page 60.
During the year the Committee received advice from Towers 
Watson as the Committee's appointed remuneration advisers. In 201 1 
Towers Watson provided market analysis relating to the executive 
directors, and other senior executives. In addition, Towers Watson 
provided general advice in relation to:
  
remuneration strategy; 
  
background information about remuneration trends; and 
  
calculations of total shareholder return (TSR) in connection with 
the Deferred Bonus and Long-term Incentive Plans. 
Towers Watson also provides advice to the Company in respect 
of individuals outside the terms of reference of the Remuneration 
Committee, including advice on human resource policies, 
remuneration practice including on non-executive directors' fees, 
advice on healthcare and benefits provision, pension administration 
and actuarial services. Towers Watson is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and is committed to that Group's 
voluntary code of practice for remuneration consultants in the UK. This 
includes processes for ensuring integrity and objectivity of advice to 
the Remuneration Committee.

In the event of early termination, the Remuneration Committee will, 
within legal constraints, determine the approach to be taken 
according to the circumstances of each individual case, taking account 
of the departing director's obligation to mitigate his loss. In certain 
circumstances, and other than for termination for non-performance, 
the executive directors may receive compensation upon early 
termination of a contract which could, depending on the 
circumstances at the relevant time, amount to up to one year's 
remuneration based on base salary, benefits in kind and pension 
rights during the notice period. Any payment of bonus in these 
circumstances would depend on the facts at the time, as there are no 
guaranteed bonus provisions.
Table 1 (on page 73) sets out details of the executive directors' 
salaries. 
b. Short-term incentive plan 
The short-term incentive plan provides focus on the delivery of 
stretching and strategically aligned annual financial targets and 
personal objectives. It seeks to provide executive directors, members 
of the Executive Management Committee and senior managers with 
the opportunity to increase overall remuneration levels for achieving 
demanding performance targets.
Short-term incentive plan arrangements 
The structure for the 2011 and 2012 short-term incentive plan for 
executive directors is:
Element Maximum opportunity
Total financial and personal 
objectives 
Providing a maximum 
opportunity for executive 
directors of up to 1 25% of salary
Financial objectives (with a 
maximum of 70% of salary for 
achievement of Group operating 
profit targets and 35% of salary 
for achievement of Group free  
cash flow targets)
Up to 105% of salary
Measurable personal objectives Up to 20% of salary
Compulsory deferral into 
Deferred Bonus Plan
50% of bonus payable
Voluntary deferral opportunity * Up to a further 50% of bonus 
payable 
*The opportunity for voluntary deferral will not be offered in respect of the 201 2 
annual bonus. 
The annual bonus payments in respect of 201 1 are included in table 1 
on page 73. Both Simon Pryce and Mark Hoad received 85.4% of their 
salary in respect of the performance against the financial objectives 
set (50.4% in respect of partial achievement of Group operating profit 
targets, 35% in respect of full achievement of Group free cash flow 
targets). Simon Pryce received 19% and Mark Hoad received 18% in 
respect of achievement of their respective personal objectives, which 
included objectives relating to strategy development, succession 
planning, contingency planning, efficiency improvements and 
professional development. 
The Committee has considered relative performance measures 
carefully but due to the unique nature of BBA Aviation and the lack of 
an effective comparator group, believes that the two performance 
measures now in use in the longer-term performance incentives - EPS 
and ROIC - are the best available indication of the long-term financial 
success and value creation of the Company. It also believes that these 
measures are well aligned with the long-term interests of 
shareholders.
3. Executive Directors' Remuneration 
a. Salary, Benefits and Service Contract
Salary reflects the role and contribution to the Company of the 
executives in terms of skills and experience.
Base salaries are reviewed annually. Individual salary decisions 
take into account business performance, personal contribution, the 
level of pay awards and conditions elsewhere in the Group and market 
conditions. Reference was also made in 2011 to businesses of 
comparable size, geographic spread, business focus and opportunity 
and this comparison will be repeated every three years.
Following a review at the end of 2011 the Remuneration 
Committee approved (with effect from 1 January 2012) a 3.01% 
increase in base salary to  558,300 for Simon Pryce, a percentage 
increase in line with the salary increases given to those in the wider 
employee workforce who have performed strongly during the year.  
In relation to Mark Hoad the Remuneration Committee agreed (with 
effect from 1 January 2012) a 9.09% increase in base salary to  300,000. 
This is to reflect his continued good performance and increased 
experience and is part of a planned and stepped progression of his 
salary over three years, from his appointment in April 2010, to a market 
competitive rate. 
In addition to base salary, executive directors receive  a company 
car allowance, private medical insurance, retirement and death in 
service benefits.
All the Company's UK Defined Benefit Plans were closed to new 
entrants from April 2002; new employees from that date have the 
option to join a Company-sponsored Defined Contribution Plan. 
Simon Pryce does not participate in that Defined Contribution Plan 
and Mark Hoad does. The Company paid a sum equal to 20% of 
Simon's base salary into his own Self Invested Personal Pension until 
5 April 2011. From 6 April 2011 the Company made a cash payment 
equal to 20% of his base salary in lieu of a contribution by the 
Company to a pension scheme. A sum equal to 20% of Mark's base 
salary is paid partly into his Defined Contribution Plan and partly as a 
cash payment. No other element of their remuneration is pensionable.
It is the Committee's policy to make new executive director 
appointments with a rolling service agreement which can be 
terminated by the Company on giving 1 2 months' notice.
Set out below are the contractual notice periods for executive 
directors who served during the year.

As ROIC for 2010 was 9.5%, with ROIC for the first half of 201 1 of 10.1% 
and ROIC for the full year of 10.6% the Committee is of the view that 
these targets are suitably stretching. 
For the 2010 bonus paid in 201 1 and for future bonuses, if at any 
time before the third anniversary of the deferral into shares the 
employee leaves the Group (other than due to injury, disability, 
retirement, redundancy, death or their employing company ceasing to 
be a part of the Group) then that part of the bonus compulsorily 
deferred and still subject to restrictions would be forfeited, subject to 
the rules of the Deferred Bonus Plan. The forfeiture restrictions would 
in general be lifted as to a third on each anniversary of the deferral.  
On the third anniversary of the deferral, the shares would be released 
to the employee. If an employee left before the third anniversary any 
voluntarily deferred portion of the bonus would be retained by the 
individual, though the related matching award would usually lapse on 
their departure. 
The Committee considers the award levels under the Deferred 
Bonus Plan to be appropriate, when viewed in the context of the 
structure of the total remuneration package including the fact that 
there is a compulsorily required deferral of bonus which is forfeitable  
if the individual leaves within three years. These award levels support 
and reinforce the policy to reward sustained and superior performance 
with potential upper quartile remuneration and to retain highly 
capable executives. 
The matching awards made under the Deferred Bonus Plan  
in 2008 vested during 201 1 as the TSR performance condition was met 
in full. 
Details of awards made in 201 1 to the executive directors under 
the Deferred Bonus Plan are set out in table 3 on page 74.
c. Longer-term performance incentives - Deferred Bonus Plan
The structure of deferred bonuses, paid in shares, places increased 
focus on long-term alignment with shareholders' interests, reinforces 
the critical importance of maintaining performance and both 
enhances and supports retention.
The Remuneration Committee believes that it is important to 
encourage personal investment and ongoing shareholding in BBA 
Aviation plc. The Company has had a Deferred Bonus Plan since 2006 
and this plan enables a significant proportion of executive directors' 
remuneration to be deferred and linked to performance-related long-
term incentives. 
A fixed percentage of the annual bonus awarded to executive 
directors and other senior management has to be deferred into BBA 
Aviation's shares for a period of three years. Executive directors and 
other senior management may in 2012 voluntarily defer a further 
percentage of their 2011 annual bonus into shares held under the 
terms of the Deferred Bonus Plan. In respect of the 2012 annual bonus 
to be paid in 2013 it is not planned to offer this opportunity for further 
voluntary deferral. The Company makes a matching award of shares 
(on a one to one basis) calculated by reference to the total amount of 
bonus deferred (whether voluntarily or compulsorily). These matching 
awards are subject to a performance condition that is tested at the end 
of the three-year performance period and the awards will lapse if the 
condition is not met. 
The overall effect is to defer the payment of at least 50% of the 
annual bonus earned by executive directors as shown by the timeline 
below:

In the past, the performance condition that was used for the matching 
awards was comparative TSR, but in 2009 the Committee decided to 
move to the more relevant Company specific financial measure of 
ROIC in respect to the matching awards that were made in relation to 
the 2010 annual bonus deferred under the Deferred Bonus Plan in 
March 2011. The Committee's intention in relation to the matching 
awards to be made in relation to the 2011 annual bonus deferred 
under the Deferred Bonus Plan in March 2012 is for the ROIC 
performance condition to be increased. The ROIC performance 
conditions used for the matching awards made in 2011 (in relation to 
the deferral of 2010 annual bonus) and proposed to be made for any 
awards in 201 2 are as follows:

TSR is measured by reference to the six months immediately following 
the start of the three-year performance period and the three months 
after the end of the performance period and therefore the TSR 
element of any performance condition cannot usually be tested 
before April of the relevant year. 
The TSR performance conditions in respect of the awards of 
conditional shares made in 2008 and 2009 (50% TSR) and the matching 
awards made in 2008, 2009 and 2010 (100% TSR) are measured over a

As mentioned above, the Committee's intention in relation to the 
matching awards to be made in 2012 is for the ROIC performance 
condition to be increased, with full vesting if average annual ROIC is 
1 2%, and 25% vesting if average annual ROIC is 10.5%.
d. Longer-term performance incentives - Long-term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) and Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP)
The Company's longer-term performance incentives reward 
achievement of longer-term strategic objectives and provide the 
executive directors with accountability for the delivery of that strategy.
LTIP
Under the LTIP , conditional awards of shares can be made of up to one 
times the executive's base salary or up to two times base salary if the 
Remuneration Committee determines that the executive will not be 
granted options in that year. In 2011, conditional awards made to 
Simon Pryce were one times base salary, while those made to Mark 
Hoad were half times base salary. For the awards planned to be made 
in 2012 it is intended that the level of award to Simon Pryce will be one 
and a half times base salary, while those made to Mark Hoad will be 
three-quarters of base salary. 
Part of the conditional share awards made under the LTIP in 
2008 vested during 2011 as the TSR element of the performance 
condition was fully satisfied. The EPS element of the performance 
condition was not met and that element of the LTIP award lapsed.
Details of awards made in 201 1 to the executive directors under 
the LTIP are set out in table 3 on page 74.
ESOP
Under the ESOP, the maximum value of options which an executive 
may be granted in any year is limited to three times base salary, or four 
times base salary if the Remuneration Committee determines that an 
executive will not receive an award under the LTIP in that year. There is 
no intention to grant unapproved options under the ESOP .
During 2011, a total of 46,447 HMRC approved options were 
granted under the ESOP to three UK taxpayers in conjunction with 
awards made under the LTIP. Neither of the executive directors 
received an award under the ESOP in 201 1.
No participant can be granted approved options with a value of 
more than  30,000 (calculated at the date of grant) and any gain that is 
made on the approved options by a UK taxpayer will be subject to the 
capital gains tax regime rather than income tax, but this does not 
affect the Company's own tax bill. The combination of the award of 
HMRC approved options and the awards made under the LTIP did not 
exceed the economic value of that which would have been delivered 
under the previous arrangements of a conditional share award under 
the LTIP alone. 
e. Longer-term performance incentives - performance conditions 
and other terms
The conditional awards of shares made in 2008 and 2009 under the 
LTIP are subject to two performance conditions measured over three-
year periods. One half of each award is subject to a performance 
condition that measures the Company's TSR against a comparator 
group of companies. The other half of each award is subject to an 
adjusted EPS performance condition. 
After consultation with the Company's major shareholders in 
2009, it was agreed that the performance condition for share awards 
under the LTIP (and any associated share options) made in 2010 would 
be solely EPS-based. 
Directors'  Remuneration  
Report  72   Directors' Report
In line with the method used to test the satisfaction of performance 
conditions under previous awards, the Remuneration Committee has 
chosen to have the benefit of the expertise of an independent 
remuneration consulting firm, Towers Watson, to calculate TSR and the 
external auditors will perform certain agreed procedures on the EPS 
and ROIC calculations. EPS and ROIC growth are both calculated on a 
constant exchange rate basis. 
At present, awards made under either the LTIP or ESOP or the 
Deferred Bonus Plan lapse (subject to the rules of the relevant plan) 
when an employee leaves the Company, except when the 
Remuneration Committee exercises its discretion to permit awards (in 
part or whole) to be retained and tested at the end of the performance 
period. The exercise of such discretion is guided by the principles 
(including reduction by a service factor) set out in a leaver matrix 
approved by the Remuneration Committee and is always subject to 
the rules of the relevant share plan, which set out the treatment of 
awards when an employee dies, is made redundant or leaves due to 
injury, disability, retirement or their employing company ceasing to be 
a part of the Group. It is intended that this practice will continue to 
apply to awards made (under the LTIP , the ESOP and also the Deferred 
Bonus Plan) in 201 2 and beyond.
BBA Group longer-term incentive plans prior to 2005
The BBA Group 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan) 
provided for awards of options, conditional shares and matching 
shares. Some options granted under the 2004 Plan remain exercisable 
as do some executive options awarded by the Company prior to 2005 
which were made under the BBA Group 1994 Executive Share Option 
Scheme which expired in April 2004. Prior to March 2002 the BBA 
Group 1995 Executive Share Appreciation Rights Plan was used to 
facilitate the grant of options to US executives on the same basis as the 
1994 Executive Share Option Scheme. The last award under the BBA 
Group  1995 Executive Share Appreciation Rights Plan lapsed on 
1 October 201 1.
BBA Group 2004 Savings-Related Share Option Scheme
Executive directors may be eligible to participate in the BBA Group 
2004 Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all 
eligible UK employees. Options are granted under three or five-year 
SAYE contracts at a 20% discount to the stock market price at the offer 
date. The maximum overall employee contribution is  250 per month. 
Share ownership requirements
As part of its strategy to align shareholders' and directors' interests, the 
Remuneration Committee expects all executive directors to build and 
maintain from shares vesting under the long-term incentive plans a 
holding of shares with a value at least equal to their base salary. 
Clawback
All unvested share scheme awards made since 2010 to Executive 
Management Committee members are subject to provisions 
concerning cancellation and reduction in the event of material 
financial mis-statement.
EPS performance condition
The EPS performance conditions in respect of awards of conditional 
shares made in 2008 and 2009 (50%) are measured over a three-year 
performance period:
EPS growth per annum  
(2008 and 2009 awards)
Percentage of EPS part of  
award vesting
At or above retail price index (RPI) 
increase plus 7% per annum
Between RPI increase plus 3% 
and 7%  per annum

The EPS performance conditions in respect of the award of conditional 
shares made in 2010 and 2011 are measured over a three-year 
performance period:
EPS growth per annum  
(2010 and 201 1 awards) Percentage of award vesting
At or above RPI increase plus

Nil
In setting these EPS performance conditions the Committee took into 
account both the growth prospects in the current market conditions 
and the wider economic environment including inflation trends. 
As mentioned above, the EPS performance condition in respect 
of the award of conditional shares to be made under the LTIP in 2012 
will still be measured over a three-year performance period, but is 
planned to be an absolute annual EPS growth target (6% for minimum 
vesting and 12% for maximum vesting), reflecting the economic 
environment, market expectations and the Group's strategic plan. 
Awards and testing
The details of the exact numbers of the awards to be made in 2012 are 
not known at the date of this Report, as they are calculated based on 
the share price at the time of the award, which is expected to be in 
March 201 2. 
The awards made in 2009 will be tested and, if vesting, will be 
released to participants in April 2012, while those made in 2010 will be 
tested and, if vesting, will be released to participants in March 2013. 
The awards made in 201 1, if vesting, will be released to participants in 
March 2014. There is no retesting of any performance conditions.

On pages 18 and 19 the adjusted earnings per share and ROIC figures 
for the past five years are set out. These are two of the key 
performance indicators tied to the Group's mission statement which 
BBA Aviation uses to monitor progress against its goals: hence these 
are the measures used in the performance conditions of the share plan 
awards made in 201 1.

1 Benefits include benefits in kind such as life assurance and private medical insurance.
2 The Company's pension contribution for Simon Pryce is 20% of basic salary. For the period 1 January 201 1 to 5 April 201 1 the Company paid  27 ,100 into  
Simon Pryce's Self Invested Personal Pension. For the period 6 April 201 1 to 31 December 201 1 he received  81,300 in lieu of a contribution by the Company to  
a pension scheme.
3 50% of the 201 1 annual bonus is subject to compulsory deferral and also subject to forfeiture in the circumstances described in page 70.
4 The Company's pension contribution for Mark Hoad is 20% of basic salary. During the year the Company paid  51,250 into Mark Hoad's Defined Contribution Plan. 
From 6 April 201 1 the Company's contribution in excess of the annual allowance of  50,000 for the tax year 201 1/1 2 was paid in cash and he received  3,750.
5 The non-executive director fee paid to Hansel Tookes is a US dollar-based fee of $90,000 per annum (2010: US$84,000). The sterling amount paid during 201 1  
was the same as that paid in 2010 as a result of the change in the sterling/US dollar exchange rate.
6 If the total remuneration for 201 1 of  2,267 ,000 and for 2010 of  1,930,000 had been converted using the 201 1 average rate of 1.60 then the total remuneration  
for 201 1 would have been $3,627 ,200 and for 2010 would have been $3,088,000. If the 2010 amount of total remuneration had been converted using the average 
rate of 2010, namely 1.55, then the US dollar equivalent for the total remuneration of 2010 would have been $2,991,500. The salaries and other emoluments of 
Simon Pryce and Mark Hoad and the fees for Michael Harper, Mark Harper, Nick Land and Peter Ratcliffe were paid in sterling.

shares received by Mark Hoad was  82,21 2.
Additional notes
i The performance conditions in respect of the conditional awards made in 2008 were partially satisfied (see page 71 for details). 
ii Under normal circumstances, a linked award will only vest to the extent needed to provide sufficient funds to meet the exercise price of an Approved Share 
Option under the 2006 Executive Share Option Plan. The numbers stated in table 3 will be the maximum number of shares that will vest under the linked award 
which is linked to the number (noted in table 4 on page 75) of Approved Share Options granted under the 2006 Executive Share Option Plan. Fewer shares will  
vest under the linked award if the share price increases between the date of grant and vesting as fewer shares will be required to cover the exercise price of the 
Approved Share Option.

Chairman, Remuneration Committee
4. Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration
The non-executive directors each have a letter of appointment which 
is available for inspection by shareholders at each AGM and during 
normal business hours at the Company's registered office. No 
compensation would be payable for the early termination of the 
appointment of any non-executive director.
The level of fees for non-executive directors is determined by the 
Board as a whole on the recommendation of the Group Chief 
Executive. Non-executive directors' fees were reviewed in December 
2011, by reference to independent market surveys and benchmarking 
data. With effect from 1 January 2012 Hansel Tookes' fee was increased 
from $90,000 to $92,700. The other non-executive directors' basic fee 
was also increased by 3% to  46,350. The fee paid to the Chairman  
was increased similarly by 3% to  190,550. The annual supplements for 
the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees were 
increased from  9,500 to  9,785, that for the Senior Independent 
Director from  5,000 to  5,150 and the annual supplement for the  
CSR Responsible Director from  2,500 to  2,575. These supplements 
reflect the increased commitments and demands placed upon each of 
the non-executive directors in performing their duties on the Board 
and its principal committees.
Details of the non-executive directors' fees for 201 1 are set out in 
table 1 (page 73). 
The dates of appointment or subsequent re-appointment and
