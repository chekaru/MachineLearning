Directors' Remuneration Report
Mark Harper
Chairman of the  
Remuneration Committee
I am pleased to introduce our Directors' Remuneration Report 
for 2012, which sets out the Group's policy on directors' 
remuneration and how that has been applied during the year. 
Despite softer than expected market conditions, the 
Group's share price has marginally outperformed the FTSE 250 
and the S&P 500 composite price index and total shareholder 
return at 30.8% exceeded the 26.1% delivered across the FTSE 
250 index. The financial highlights for 2012, 2011 and 2010 are 
shown on page 64. 
The Committee focuses on and prioritises the creation of 
effective executive compensation structures specific to BBA 
Aviation that: 
   are closely aligned with and reward the delivery of, the 
Group's long-term strategy for sustainable value creation; 
and
   ensure that the Group can compete effectively for executive 
talent in the international markets in  which it operates.
In formulating and implementing remuneration policy, the 
Committee continues to engage in proactive dialogue with its 
major investors and their representative bodies and also reflect, 
where practical, the constantly evolving and differing views of 
stakeholders and the variety of approaches that are perceived as 
best practice for UK listed companies in the area of executive 
remuneration.
Prior to the 2012 AGM, ISS RREV proxy advisory services 
issued a  vote against' recommendation in respect of the 
resolution to approve the 2011 Remuneration Report and just 
over 20% of shareholders voted against this resolution. There 
has therefore been more detailed consultation with shareholders 
and representative bodies to clarify aspects of, and the rationale 
behind, our policy and practice and changes to our plans for 
2013. As a result of feedback received during this period, the 
Remuneration Committee intends to look at ways to further 
simplify our management incentives in the future for 2014 and 
beyond.
Shareholders' attention is also drawn to the bonus received by 
the executive directors in 2012 compared with 2011. As a 
consequence of the softer market conditions experienced 
during 2012 and despite a good underlying operating 
performance the percentage of salary awarded to Simon Pryce 
for his 2012 bonus has fallen from 104.4% to 58.7% and for Mark 
Hoad from 103.4% to 58.7%.  The emoluments and fees for 2012 
shown in Table 1 on page 72 for Simon Pryce and Mark Hoad 
have fallen by 17% and 12% respectively.  
For 2013 the Committee intends to reduce the minimum 
threshold vesting of the long-term incentive plan (LTIP) to 25% 
(201 2: 33%). The Committee will also introduce two performance 
conditions for the 2013 LTIP awards, one being a challenging 
ROIC condition and the other a stretching adjusted earnings per 
share (EPS) condition.
The same performance conditions and minimum 
threshold vesting will also be mirrored in the conditions of the 
other long-term element of the Group's incentive schemes, 
namely the matching element of the deferred bonus plan (DBP).
Changes to remuneration of the executive directors that 
have been agreed in 2012 are highlighted in the relevant section 
of this Report. They include an increase in Mark Hoad's base 
salary, a consequence of the planned and stepped progression 
of his salary over 3 years following his appointment in 2010 and 
an increase in his maximum potential LTIP award to 100% of 
base salary.

Directors' Remuneration Report
Remuneration summary
The Committee believes that driving improvements in the Group's ROIC and adjusted EPS are the principal mechanisms for creating 
sustainable shareholder value. These two measures will be applied to all awards granted in 2013 under the Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) 
and the LTIP .
The elements of the executive directors' remuneration planned for 2013 are summarised in the tables opposite and described in 
more detail in the rest of the Report.
Remuneration mix
The following charts show the balance between fixed and variable elements of the remuneration package for each of the executive 
directors. The upper bar on each chart shows the position (labelled target) if half of the maximum potential variable remuneration was 
received. The lower bar on each chart shows the position (labelled stretch) if the maximum potential variable remuneration was 
received. As more stretching performance is achieved, so the proportion of variable to fixed remuneration increases.
The actual value of performance-related incentives will depend on actual performance. 
The targets for variable remuneration include operating profit, free cash flow, adjusted EPS and ROIC, all of which strongly align to 
the Company's strategic objective of creating longer-term sustainable value.

Directors' Report
Directors' Remuneration Report 66
During the year, the Committee also consulted the Chairman, the 
Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, the Group HR 
Director and the Group Secretary in connection with the 
Committee's work. It is expected that the Committee will wish to 
continue to consult with them in 2013 and that they will continue 
to be invited to attend Committee meetings when appropriate.
2. Remuneration Policy 
The Committee believes that a significant element of executive 
directors' remuneration should be linked to performance-related 
long-term incentives.
The Group's remuneration policy is intended to ensure 
that the remuneration of executive directors and other senior 
executives properly reflects their duties and responsibilities  
and is  sufficient to attract, retain and motivate high calibre 
senior management capable collectively of delivering the goals  
of the Company.
The policy of the Committee is to provide base salaries that 
are positioned around mid-market when compared with relevant 
local market data to ensure that it can recruit and retain suitable 
talent. In determining short and longer-term incentives, reference 
is made to the wider, regional and global markets and in particular 
North America where the majority of the company's employees 
and management teams are located.
The Remuneration Committee believes that a significant 
element of executive directors' remuneration should be linked to 
performance-related long-term incentives and that alignment 
between Group strategy and the remuneration of its senior 
executives is critical. 
This policy is reflected in the Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)
where the Matching Awards will only vest if demanding ROIC 
targets are met (see section 3c below for more detail). In the future 
the DBP Matching award will be subject to a ROIC and adjusted 
EPS target. The compulsory requirement to defer bonus ties the 
long-term value of executive remuneration closely to the 
Company's performance.
Total executive remuneration is structured to create  
the potential for upper quartile rewards based on the  
delivery of superior performance with a significant proportion  
of variable pay subject to stretching performance targets. The 
Committee believes that the remuneration packages of the 
executive directors contain a suitable balance of fixed and  
variable  remuneration. 
In connection with the ABI Responsible Investment 
Disclosure Guidelines the Remuneration Committee confirms 
that it considers corporate performance on environmental, 
social  and governance issues when setting the remuneration 
of  executive directors. The Committee also believes that the 
incentive structure for senior management does not raise 
environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently 
motivating irresponsible behaviour and is compatible with the 
Company's risk policies and systems. 
Introduction
This Report outlines the Company's remuneration policy and 
practice for the financial year ended 31 December 2012, as well 
as other specific disclosures required, such as those relating to 
directors' shareholdings and other interests. 
Information in this report is unaudited other than that which 
is required to be audited and that is stated as such in the relevant 
table. This Report has been prepared taking into account the 
provisions of the UK's Corporate Governance Code published in 
June 2010 (the Code) and in accordance with the requirements of 
the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) Regulations 2008 and the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority.
This Report will be submitted to shareholders for an 
advisory vote at the BBA Aviation plc AGM in May 2013.
1. Remuneration Committee
Although the Board considers itself ultimately responsible for 
remuneration policy, it has delegated prime responsibility for 
implementing that policy as it relates to senior executive 
remuneration to the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration 
Committee is a Committee of the Board consisting exclusively  
of non-executive directors and its meetings are minuted by  
the Group Secretary. No director is directly involved in the 
determination of, or votes on, any matter relating to their own 
remuneration.
The Committee is responsible for:
   determining executive directors' remuneration; 
   setting targets for the short-term and longer-term incentive 
plans and performance-related share plans; 
   reviewing proposals in respect of other senior executives; and
  overseeing any major changes in employee incentive 
structures throughout the Group. 
Further information on the work of the Remuneration Committee 
and details of the Committee's membership are set out in the 
Directors' Corporate Governance Statement on page 58.
During the year the Committee received advice from 
Towers Watson as the Committee's appointed remuneration 
advisers.  In 2012 Towers Watson provided market analysis relating 
to the executive directors and other senior executives.  In addition, 
Towers Watson provided general advice in relation to:
   remuneration strategy; 
   background information about remuneration trends; and 
   calculations of total shareholder return (TSR) in connection 
with the older Deferred Bonus and Long-term Incentive Plans. 
Towers Watson also provides advice to the Company in respect of 
human resource policies, healthcare and benefits provision, 
pension administration and actuarial services and remuneration 
practice including on non-executive directors' fees. Towers 
Watson is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and 
is committed to that Group's voluntary code of practice for 
remuneration consultants in the UK. This includes processes for 
ensuring integrity and objectivity of advice to the Remuneration 
Committee.

To ensure that the Company offers appropriate incentives to 
enhance shareholder value, the Committee assesses the 
constituent elements of the remuneration of the executive 
directors as follows: 
Fixed elements:
   salary, benefits and service contract
   pension
Variable elements
   annual bonus
   deferred bonus plan
   long-term incentive plan including executive share option plan
This mix is illustrated graphically in the charts on page 64.
In determining remuneration, consideration is given to 
reward levels throughout the organisation as well as in the 
external employment market. The Committee aims to reward 
employees fairly based on their role, their experience, their 
performance and salary levels in the wider market. 
The remuneration policy described in this Report will be 
kept under review, but the current intention is that the policy 
should continue to apply in future financial years. 
3. Executive Directors' Remuneration 
a. Salary, Benefits and Service Contract
Salary reflects the role and contribution to the Company of the 
executives in terms of skills and experience.
Base salaries are reviewed annually. Individual salary 
decisions take into account business performance, personal 
contribution, the level of pay awards and conditions elsewhere 
in  the Group and market conditions. In 2011 a review was 
conducted against businesses of comparable size, geographic 
spread, business focus and opportunity.
Following a review at the end of 2012 the Remuneration 
Committee approved (with effect from 1 January 2013) a 2.99% 
increase in base salary to  575,000 for Simon Pryce, a percentage 
increase in line with the salary increases given to those in the 
wider employee workforce who have performed strongly during 
the year. In relation to Mark Hoad the Remuneration Committee 
agreed (with effect from 1 January 2013) an 8.33% increase in 
base salary to  325,000. This is to reflect his continued good 
performance and increased experience and is the final year 
of a planned and stepped progression of his salary over three 
years, from his appointment in April 2010, towards a market 
competitive rate. 
In addition to base salary, executive directors receive a 
company car allowance, private medical insurance, retirement 
and death in service benefits.
The Company's UK Defined Benefit Plan was closed to new 
entrants from April 2002; new employees from that date have the 
option to join a Company-sponsored Defined Contribution Plan. 
Simon Pryce does not participate in that Defined Contribution 
Plan and Mark Hoad does. The Company makes a cash payment 
equal to 20% of Simon Pryce's base salary in lieu of a contribution 
by the Company to a pension scheme.  Mark Hoad receives a sum 
equal to 20% of his base salary as a pension contribution. Part of 
this is received in cash and part is paid into his Defined Contribution 
Plan. No other element of the executive directors' remuneration is 
pensionable. It is the Committee's policy to make new executive 
director appointments with a rolling service agreement which 
can be terminated by the Company on giving 12 months' notice.
Set out below are the contractual notice periods for 
executive directors who served during the year. 
Months' Notice
Contract 
Date
By
Company 
To
Company
Simon Pryce 23/04/07 12 12
Mark Hoad 29/04/10 12 6
In the event of early termination, the Remuneration Committee 
will, within legal constraints, determine the approach to be taken 
according to the circumstances of each individual case, taking 
account of the departing director's obligation to mitigate his loss. 
In certain circumstances, and other than for termination for non-
performance, the executive directors may receive compensation 
upon early termination of a contract which could, depending on 
the circumstances at the relevant time, amount to up to one year's 
remuneration based on base salary, benefits in kind and pension 
rights during the notice period. There are no guaranteed bonus 
provisions and there is no entitlement to any bonus payments if 
an employee is under notice given or received at the end of the 
applicable financial year.
Table 1 (on page 72) sets out details of the executive 
directors' salaries and benefits. 
b. Short-term incentive plan 
The short-term incentive plan provides focus on the delivery of 
stretching and strategically aligned annual financial targets and 
personal objectives. It seeks to provide executive directors, 
members of the Executive Management Committee and senior 
managers with the opportunity to increase overall remuneration 
levels for achieving demanding performance targets.
Short-term incentive plan arrangements 
The structure for the 2012 and 2013 short-term incentive plan for 
executive directors is:
Element Maximum opportunity
Total financial and personal 
objectives 
Providing a maximum 
opportunity for executive 
directors of up to 125%  
of salary
Financial objectives (with a 
maximum of 70% of salary for 
achievement of Group operating 
profit targets and 35% of salary  
for achievement of Group free  
cash flow targets)
Up to 105% of salary
Measurable personal objectives Up to 20% of salary
Compulsory deferral into  
Deferred Bonus Plan
50% of bonus payable
The annual bonus payments in respect of 2012 are included in 
table 1 on page 72. Both Simon Pryce and Mark Hoad received 
40.7% of their salary in respect of the performance against the 
financial objectives set (20.0% in respect of partial achievement of  68
annual bonus) and the adjusted EPS condition is intended to be 
the same range as that used in 2012 in relation to the LTIP .
2012 awards under Deferred Bonus Plan
   Three-year performance 
period 2012 to 2014
   50% bonus payable

   25% vesting if ROIC is 10.5%
   Pro-rated between 
10.5-12.0%
   Forfeiture restrictions apply
In 201 1 ROIC was 10.6% and in 2012 it was 10.0%. The Committee 
is of the view that these targets are sufficiently stretching over the 
three year performance period.
For awards made in 201 1 and subsequently, if the employee 
leaves the Group at any time before the third anniversary of the 
deferral then that part of the bonus compulsorily deferred and still 
subject to restrictions would be forfeited, subject to the rules of 
the Deferred Bonus Plan. This does not apply to an employee 
leaving by reason of injury, disability, retirement, redundancy, 
death or their employing company ceasing to be a part of the 
Group. The forfeiture restrictions would in general be lifted as to a 
third on each anniversary of the deferral. On the third anniversary 
of the deferral, the shares would be released to the employee.
In 2011 and 2012 employees had the opportunity to 
voluntarily defer an additional portion of their bonus and therefore 
if they left before the third anniversary any voluntarily deferred 
portion of the bonus would be retained by the individual, 
though the related matching award would usually lapse on their 
departure. The opportunity for voluntary deferral will not be 
offered in 2013.
The Committee considers the award levels under the 
Deferred Bonus Plan to be appropriate, when viewed in the 
context of the structure of the total remuneration package 
including the fact that there is a compulsorily required deferral of 
bonus which is forfeitable if the individual leaves within three 
years. These award levels support and reinforce the policy to 
reward sustained and superior performance with potential upper 
quartile remuneration and to retain highly capable executives. 
The matching awards made under the Deferred Bonus Plan 
in 2009 vested during 2012 as the TSR performance condition 
was met in full. The TSR performance condition was replaced for 
grants made after 2010. 
Details of awards made in 2012 to the executive directors 
under the Deferred Bonus Plan are set out in table 3 on page 73.
d. Longer-term performance incentives - Long-term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP) and Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP)
The Company's longer-term performance incentives reward 
achievement of longer-term strategic objectives and provide the 
executive directors with accountability for the delivery of that 
strategy.
Group operating profit targets and 20.7% in respect of partial 
achievement of Group free cash flow targets). Simon Pryce and 
Mark Hoad received 18% in respect of achievement of their 
respective personal objectives, which included objectives  
relating to strategy development, efficiency improvements and 
professional development. 
c. Longer-term performance incentives - Deferred Bonus Plan
The structure of deferred bonuses, paid in shares, places increased 
focus on long-term alignment with shareholders' interests, 
reinforces the critical importance of maintaining performance and 
both enhances and supports retention.
The Remuneration Committee believes that it is important 
to encourage personal investment and ongoing shareholding in 
BBA Aviation plc. The Company has had a Deferred Bonus Plan 
since 2006 and this plan enables a significant proportion of 
executive directors' short-term remuneration to be deferred and 
linked to performance-related long-term incentives. 
A fixed percentage of the annual bonus awarded to 
executive directors and other senior management has to be 
deferred into BBA Aviation's shares for a period of three years. 
The  Company makes a matching award of shares (on a one  
to one  basis) calculated by reference to the total amount of  
gross bonus deferred. These matching awards are subject to a 
performance condition that is tested at the end of the three-year 
performance period and the awards will lapse if the condition is 
not met. 
The overall effect is to defer the payment of 50% of the 
annual bonus earned by executive directors as shown by the 
timeline below:
Timeline for 2012 annual bonus

The performance condition used for the matching awards since 
2011 has been ROIC. The Committee's intention in relation to the 
matching awards to be made in relation to the 2012 annual  
bonus deferred under the Deferred Bonus Plan in 2013 is for the 
performance condition to be an adjusted EPS performance 
condition as to 50% and a ROIC performance condition as to the 
other 50%. The ROIC performance condition is intended to be the 
same range as that used in 2012 (in relation to the deferral of 201 1

LTIP
Under the LTIP , conditional awards of shares can be made of up to 
one times the executive's base salary or up to two times base 
salary if the Remuneration Committee determines that the 
executive will not be granted options in that year. In 2012, 
conditional awards made to Simon Pryce were one and a half 
times base salary, while those made to Mark Hoad were three-
quarters of base salary. For the awards planned to be made in 
2013 it is intended that the level of award to Simon Pryce will 
be one and a half times base salary, while those made to Mark 
Hoad will be one times base salary. 
Part of the conditional share awards made under the LTIP in 
2009 vested during 2012 as the TSR element of the performance 
condition was fully satisfied. The adjusted EPS element of the 
performance condition was not met and that element of the LTIP 
award lapsed. TSR was not used as a performance condition for 
LTIP awards made after 2009.
Details of awards made in 2012 to the executive directors 
under the LTIP are set out in table 3 on page 73.
ESOP
Under the ESOP, the maximum value of options which an 
executive may be granted in any year is limited to three times base 
salary, or four times base salary if the Remuneration Committee 
determines that an executive will not receive an award under the 
LTIP in that year. There is no intention to grant unapproved options 
under the ESOP .
No participant can be granted approved options with a 
value of more than  30,000 (calculated at the date of grant) 
and any gain that is made on the approved options by a UK 
taxpayer will be subject to the capital gains tax regime rather 
than income tax. 
No executive director received an award under the ESOP 
during 2012. 
e. Longer-term performance incentives - performance 
conditions and other terms
The conditional awards of shares made in 2009 under the LTIP 
were subject to two performance conditions measured over a 
three-year period. One half of the award was subject to a 
performance condition that measured the Company's TSR 
against a comparator group of companies. The other half of the 
award was subject to an adjusted EPS performance condition. 
After consultation with the Company's major shareholders 
in 2009, it was agreed that the performance condition for share 
awards under the LTIP (and any associated share options) made in 
2010 and subsequently would not have a TSR element. The awards 
made in 2010, 2011 and 2012 were solely EPS-based. The 
Committee's intention in relation to the LTIP awards to be made 
in 2013 is for the performance condition to be an adjusted EPS 
performance condition as to 50% and a ROIC performance 
condition as to the other 50%. The ROIC performance condition is 
intended to be the same range as that used in 2012 (in relation to 
the Matching Awards) and the adjusted EPS condition is intended  
to be the same range as that used in 2012 in relation to the LTIP, 
although in 201 3 it is intended that threshold vesting will only result 
in 25% (2012: 33%) of the applicable portion vesting. 
TSR performance condition

condition for the 2009 LTIP awards and the 2009 and 2010 
matching awards is set out below:

TSR is measured by reference to the six months immediately 
following the start of the three-year performance period and 
the three months after the end of the performance period and 
therefore the TSR element of any performance condition cannot 
usually be tested before April of the relevant year. 
The TSR performance conditions in respect of the awards of 
conditional shares made in 2009 (50% TSR) and the matching 
awards made in 2009 and 2010 (100% TSR) are measured over a

In setting these EPS performance conditions the Committee took 
into account both the growth prospects in the current market 
conditions and the wider economic environment. 
As mentioned above, in 2013 it is intended that  
threshold vesting will only result in vesting of 25% (2012: 33%) of 
the applicable portion of award subject to the adjusted EPS 
performance condition.
Awards and testing
The details of the exact numbers of the awards to be made in 2013 
are not known at the date of this Report, as they are calculated 
based on the share price at the time of the award. 
The awards made in 2010 will be tested and, if vesting, will 
be released to participants in 2013, while those made in 2011 will 
be tested and, if vesting, will be released to participants in 2014. 
The awards made in 201 2, if vesting, will be released to participants 
in 2015. There is no retesting of any performance conditions. 
Directors' Report
Directors' Remuneration Report
In line with the method used to test the satisfaction of performance 
conditions under previous awards, the Remuneration Committee 
has chosen to have the benefit of the expertise of an independent 
remuneration consulting firm, Towers Watson, to calculate TSR 
and the external auditor will perform certain agreed procedures 
on the adjusted EPS and ROIC calculations. Adjusted EPS growth 
and ROIC are both calculated on a constant exchange rate basis. 
At present, awards made under either the LTIP or ESOP or 
the Deferred Bonus Plan lapse (subject to the rules of the relevant 
plan) when an employee leaves the Company, except when the 
Remuneration Committee exercises its discretion to permit 
awards (in part or whole) to be retained and tested at the end of 
the performance period. The exercise of such discretion is guided 
by the principles (including reduction by a service factor) set out 
in a leaver matrix approved by the Remuneration Committee. The 
discretion is always subject to the rules of the relevant share plan, 
which set out the treatment of awards when an employee dies, is 
made redundant or leaves due to injury, disability, retirement or 
their employing company ceasing to be a part of the Group. It is 
intended that this practice will continue to apply to awards made 
(under the LTIP , the ESOP and also the Deferred Bonus Plan) in 201 3 
and beyond.
BBA Group longer-term incentive plans prior to 2005
The BBA Group 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan) 
provided for awards of options, conditional shares and matching 
shares. Some options granted under the 2004 Plan remain 
exercisable as do some executive options awarded by the 
Company prior to 2005 which were made under the BBA Group 
1994 Executive Share Option Scheme which expired in April 2004. 
BBA Group 2004 Savings-Related Share Option Scheme
Executive directors may be eligible to participate in the BBA Group 
2004 Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all 
eligible UK employees. Options are granted under three or five-
year SAYE contracts at a 20% discount to the stock market price at 
the offer date. The maximum overall employee contribution is 
 250 per month. 
Share ownership requirements
As part of its strategy to align shareholders' and directors' interests, 
the Remuneration Committee expects all executive directors to 
build and maintain from shares vesting under the long-term 
incentive plans a holding of shares with a value at least equal to 
their base salary.
Clawback
All unvested share scheme awards made since 2010 to Executive 
Management Committee members are subject to provisions 
concerning cancellation and reduction in the event of material 
financial mis-statement. 71

Performance charts
On pages 18 and 19 the adjusted EPS and ROIC figures for the past five years are set out. These are two of the key performance indicators 
tied to the Group's mission statement which BBA Aviation uses to monitor progress against its goals: hence these are the measures used 
in the performance conditions of the share plan awards made in 2012. 
However, the currently applicable regulations require that charts showing the Company's TSR over the last five financial years compared 
with the equivalent information for the FTSE 350 Industrial Transportation sector be included in this Report. These are set out below. 
(The Remuneration Committee considers the FTSE 350 Industrial Transportation sector to be a suitable broad-based equity market 
index of which the Company is a constituent for the purposes of these charts.) The graph on the left shows the annual change in TSR 
for the Company and the index, while the graph on the right shows the cumulative change in TSR from 1 January 2008 to 1 January 201 3.

1  Benefits include benefits in kind such as life assurance and private medical insurance.
2  The Company's pension contribution for Simon Pryce is 20% of basic salary. During the year he received  1 1 1,660 in lieu of a contribution by the 
Company to a pension scheme.
3  50% of the 201 2 annual bonus is subject to compulsory deferral and also subject to forfeiture in the circumstances described earlier in this report.
4  The Company's pension contribution for Mark Hoad is 20% of basic salary. During the year the Company paid  50,000 into Mark Hoad's Defined 
Contribution Plan. The Company's contribution in excess of the annual allowance of  50,000 was paid in cash and he received  10,000.
5  From date of appointment 10 April 201 2. 
6  The non-executive director fee paid to Hansel Tookes is a US dollar-based fee of $92,700 per annum (201 1: US$90,000). The sterling amount paid during 
201 2 has increased from that paid in 201 1 as a result of the change in the sterling/US dollar exchange rate.
7  If the total remuneration for 201 2 of  2,020,000 and for 201 1 of  2,267 ,000 had been converted using the 201 2 average rate of 1.59 then the total 
remuneration for 201 2 would have been $3,21 1,800 and for 201 1 would have been $3,604,530. If the 201 1 amount of total remuneration had been 
converted using the average rate of 201 1, namely 1.60, then the US dollar equivalent for the total remuneration of 201 1 would have been $3,627 ,200.  
The salaries and other emoluments of Simon Pryce and Mark Hoad and the fees for Michael Harper, Mark Harper, Susan Kilsby, Nick Land and Peter 
Ratcliffe were paid in sterling. 
 US dollar amounts for total remuneration (for 201 2 and 201 1 ) are shown in note 7 above, because with effect from the 201 1 year end results, the  
Group's presentation currency has been US dollars. In the narrative of this Remuneration Report all amounts are shown in sterling, the currency that  
the executive directors are paid in and the currency that is used in the parent company financial statements of BBA Aviation plc for the year ended  
31 December 201 2.

Additional notes
i  The performance conditions in respect of the conditional awards made in 2009 were partially satisfied (see pages 69 and 70 for details). 
ii  Under normal circumstances, a linked award will only vest to the extent needed to provide sufficient funds to meet the exercise price of an Approved 
Share Option under the 2006 Executive Share Option Plan. The numbers stated in table 3 will be the maximum number of shares that will vest under the 
linked award which is linked to the number (noted in table 4 on page 74) of Approved Share Options granted under the 2006 Executive Share Option 
Plan. Fewer shares will vest under the linked award if the share price increases between the date of grant and vesting as fewer shares will be required to 
cover the exercise price of the Approved Share Option.

Directors' Remuneration Report approved by the Board on

Mark Harper
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
4. Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration
The non-executive directors each have a letter of appointment 
which is available for inspection by shareholders at each AGM and 
during normal business hours at the Company's registered office. 
No compensation would be payable for the early termination of 
the appointment of any non-executive director.
Non-executive directors' fees were reviewed in December 
2012 and with effect from 1 January 2013 the non-executive 
directors' basic fee was increased by 3% from  46,350 to  47,750 
and Hansel Tookes' fee was increased by 3% from $92,700 to 
$95,490. The fee paid to the Chairman was increased similarly by 
3% from  190,550 to  196,270. The annual supplements for the 
Chairmen of the Audit and Risk and Remuneration Committees 
were increased from  9,785 to  10,080, that for the Senior 
Independent Director from  5,150 to  5,310 and the annual 
supplement for the CSR Responsible Director from  2,575 to 
 2,660. These supplements reflect the increased commitments 
and demands placed upon each of the non-executive directors in 
performing their duties on the Board and its principal committees.
Details of the non-executive directors' fees for 2012 are set 
out in table 1 (page 72).
