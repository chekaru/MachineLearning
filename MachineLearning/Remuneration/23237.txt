 You will have read in the Chairman's letter that we have 
streamlined our business into two divisions. This enables much 
greater cross-business collaboration along with process and 
practice improvement. The financial highlights for 2013 are 
shown on page 4. The Remuneration Committee recognises 
that the Company has made good progress in 2013 and 
delivered further market outperformance and an improvement 
in key operating metrics. The reward outcomes for the 
executive directors reflect the progress that has been made.
In accordance with the new regulatory framework, 
shareholders will be asked to vote on the Annual Report on 
Remuneration and on the Directors' Remuneration Policy  
at the 2014 AGM. The vote on the Annual Report on 
Remuneration is an advisory vote and the vote on the  
Directors' Remuneration Policy is binding.
Looking forward, in 2014 we are undertaking a more 
fundamental review of the structure of remuneration to  
ensure that performance measures for both short and 
long-term reward are appropriate for our business. Any 
potential changes will be designed to strengthen the link 
between pay and the effective execution of our strategy, 
recognising the cyclical nature of our business and that over 
75% of our operations are outside the UK. Any changes would 
be voted on at the 2015 AGM. 
As we refine our reward arrangements, we will look 
forward to continued engagement with shareholders as 
appropriate.

Annual Statement
In May 2013 I was very pleased to accept the appointment 
as Remuneration Committee Chairman and I am delighted  
to introduce our first Directors' Remuneration Report under  
the new reporting and voting regime. I would also like to thank 
Mark Harper the former Remuneration Committee Chairman 
for his contribution to the Committee over recent years.
Our Remuneration Policy is set out in detail in this report. 
The Remuneration Committee believes that the design of 
executive pay should be simple, understandable and rewards 
performance that promotes the effective execution of the 
Group's long-term strategy.
The Policy needs to reflect our vision, mission and values 
and should be designed to retain and motivate key executives, 
encouraging them to take actions that will deliver exceptional 
long-term sustainable value for all our shareholders and 
stakeholders.
During the course of 2013, the Remuneration Committee 
has reviewed our existing remuneration arrangements and has 
taken steps to simplify our existing plans. 
We have for some time recognised that the matching 
element of the deferred bonus plan is very similar to an award 
under our long-term incentive plan. We have concluded that 
for ease of understanding and to separate short-term, deferred 
and long-term incentive arrangements more effectively,  
the value of the matching element of the deferred bonus  
plan will be transferred into the long-term incentive plan.  
This change has no impact on the overall value of the 
remuneration package.

The Remuneration Committee and its work
The Board is responsible for remuneration policy and has delegated prime responsibility for the implementation of that Policy to the 
Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee is a Board Committee consisting exclusively of independent non-executive 
directors and its meetings are minuted by the Group Secretary. No individual is directly involved in the determination of, or votes on, 
any matter relating to their own remuneration.
The composition of the Remuneration Committee during 2013 was:
   Wayne Edmunds (from 7 August 2013);
   Mark Harper (until 10 May 2013);
   Susan Kilsby;
   Nick Land;
   Peter Ratcliffe;
   Sir Nigel Rudd (from 1 December 2013); and
   Hansel Tookes (until 30 September 2013).
Mark Harper was Remuneration Committee Chairman until he retired at the AGM on 10 May 2013 whereafter Susan Kilsby took over 
the Chairmanship of the Committee.
The Committee is responsible for, among other things:
   determining remuneration strategy;
   determining executive directors' remuneration;
   determining the remuneration of the Chairman;
   selecting performance measures and setting targets for the short-term and long-term incentive plans and performance-related 
share plans; 
   reviewing proposals in respect of other senior executives; and
   overseeing any major changes in employee incentive structures throughout the Group.
Further information on the work of the Remuneration Committee is set out in the Directors' Corporate Governance Statement on 
page 62.
Following a tendering process, Towers Watson was formally re-appointed during the year as the Remuneration Committee's 
adviser. In 2013 Towers Watson provided advice and market analysis relating to the executive directors and other senior executives.  
In addition, Towers Watson provided general advice in relation to:
   remuneration strategy; 
   background information about remuneration trends; and 
   calculations of total shareholder return (TSR) in connection with the legacy Deferred Bonus and long-term incentive plans.
 
Towers Watson have also provided advice to the Company during the year in respect of US healthcare provision, US pension 
administration and actuarial services and remuneration practice in respect of matters including non-executive directors' fees.  
Towers Watson is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and is committed to that group's voluntary code of practice  
for remuneration consultants in the UK. This includes processes for ensuring integrity and objectivity of advice to the Remuneration 
Committee and that any potential conflicts are effectively managed. As part of the Board evaluation process (see page 62 for more 
detail) the Remuneration Committee also confirmed it was satisfied that it was receiving independent advice from Towers Watson. 
The fees paid by the Company to Towers Watson during the year for advice to the Remuneration Committee totalled  57,700.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee also consulted the Chairman of the Board, the Group Chief Executive, the Group 
Finance Director, the Group HR Director and the Group Secretary in connection with the Committee's work within their particular 
areas of knowledge and expertise. It is expected that the Committee will wish to continue to consult with this group in 2014 and  
that they will continue to be invited to attend Committee meetings when appropriate. 
Additionally, the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and the Group HR Director reported 
back to the Remuneration Committee on their dialogues with shareholders and other stakeholders. The Directors' Remuneration 
Report (DRR) for the year ended 31 December 2012 was approved at the 2013 annual general meeting on a show of hands. The proxy 
votes lodged in respect of this resolution were:
Proxy votes for % for Proxy votes against % against Proxy votes lodged Votes withheld
Approval of 2012 DRR 399,632,695 99.7 1,188,131 0.3 400,820,826 2,191,403
The proxy votes for included 117,230 shares over which the Chairman had discretion. A vote withheld is not a vote in law and 
accordingly these are not included in the calculation of the percentages shown above.

Historical Cumulative TSR Performance
The graph below shows that the Company's TSR performance since the end of 2008 has significantly outperformed the FTSE 250 
and the FTSE 350 Industrial Transportation Index. The Company has previously used the FTSE 350 Industrial Transportation Index as 
a suitable comparator. The Company has reviewed the comparator and believes that the FTSE 250 Index is a more suitable broad 
based equity index of which the Company is a constituent member. In the interests of consistency and transparency both indexes 
are shown below.

Directors' Report
Directors' Remuneration Report
Remuneration for 2013
This section of the report explains how BBA Aviation's 
remuneration policy has been implemented during the  
financial year.
The Remuneration Committee recognises that BBA 
Aviation has made good progress in 2013 and delivered further 
market outperformance and an improvement in key operating 
metrics, as well as continuing to effectively execute the  
Group's growth strategy. The remuneration outcomes for the 
executive directors reflect the progress that has been made.  
The paragraphs below describe the separate elements  
of remuneration disclosed in the single figure table. 
Base Salary and Fees
The base salary effective from 1 January 2013 for Simon Pryce 
was  575,000 and for Mark Hoad was  325,000.
The fees for the Chairman and the non-executive directors 
that applied from 1 January 2013 are set out in the single figure 
table below. Wayne Edmunds and Sir Nigel Rudd were 
appointed during the year on the basic non-executive director 
fee. The fee for Sir Nigel Rudd when he becomes chairman 
after the AGM in May 2014 is  250,000 p.a. and is fixed until 
December 2017 .
Pension
The Company made a cash payment equal to 20% of Simon 
Pryce's base salary in lieu of a contribution by the Company  
to a pension scheme. Mark Hoad, who participates in the 
Company-sponsored Defined Contribution Plan, received  
a sum equal to 20% of his base salary as a pension contribution.
Other Benefits
Other benefits for the year, for each executive director included  
a company car allowance, private medical insurance, death in 
service benefit, annual holiday, sick pay, an annual health check 
and gym membership.
Annual Bonus
The annual bonus for the period to 31 December 2013 for 
executive directors was based on the achievement of  
$200.1 million of Group operating profit and $146.5 million of 
Group free cash flow. The Board has decided that the targets  
for 2013 or 2014 should not be disclosed while they remain 
commercially sensitive and will keep this under review. 
The Committee judged that Simon Pryce would receive 
90% of his maximum and Mark Hoad would receive 75% of his 
maximum for achievements of personal strategic objectives. 
The choice of performance conditions, and their respective 
weightings reflected the Committee's belief that they would 
drive action to deliver exceptional sustainable value for our 
shareholders and other stakeholders.
In light of the performance against operating profit,  
free cash flow and personal targets the Committee concluded 
that 63.7% of maximum bonus is payable to the Group Chief 
Executive and 61.3% of maximum bonus is payable to the  
Group Finance Director.
In 2013, financial performance objectives represented  
84% of bonus opportunity and personal objectives represented 
16%. Fifty per cent of annual bonus received in 2014 for 2013 
performance is paid in cash with the remaining 50% 
compulsorily deferred into shares.
Long-Term Awards
DBP
Half of each bonus in respect of 2010 paid in early 201 1 was paid 
in cash and half was deferred for a period of three years. The 
deferred element of the bonus was converted into shares and 
will be released to directors shortly after the third anniversary  
of the award. As permitted by the rules of the scheme, the 
Remuneration Committee agreed that dividends will be 
awarded on the deferred element after the date on which  
the risk of forfeiture lifts.
The deferred bonus converted into shares was subject to  
a 1:1 match of conditional shares. The awards are set out in Table 
4C on page 77 . The three-year ROIC targets applicable to this 
award are set out on page 78.
Over the three-year period, the Company achieved pre-tax 
ROIC growth of 10.23% that will result in a vesting of 36.7% of  
the awards.
The deferred bonus that vested in 2013 is shown in the 
2012 line of the single figure table because the performance 
period ended on 31 December 2012.
LTIP
The LTIP awards granted in 201 1 are shown in Table 4B on page 
76 and the earnings per share performance conditions are shown 
on page 78. The EPS performance is to be measured over the 
three-year period ended 31 December 2013. The Remuneration 
Committee concluded that the LTIP awards would vest at 44%  
of their maximum. 
The LTIP that vested in 2013 is shown in the 2012 line of the 
single figure table because the performance period ended on  
31 December 2012.

Notes
1 Each of the above awards were made on 28 May 2013. The grant price was  2.8667 which was the average of the middle market closing price on 
the three trading days prior to the grant. 
2 The LTIP Conditional Award is based on a fixed percentage of Salary (150% for Simon Pryce and 100% for Mark Hoad). The Conditional Award was 
reduced by  29,997 allowing the same value to be awarded as an Approved Share Option under the Executive Share Option Plan and as an LTIP 
Linked Award. Under normal circumstances, the Linked Award will only vest to the extent needed to provide sufficient funds to meet the exercise 
price of the Approved Share Option. The face value for both the Linked Award and the Approved Option are disclosed above - the combined face 
value of these two awards is  29,997 . 
3 The DBP Conditional Award is calculated by reference to the amount of the bonus deferred in respect of performance in 2013 and is included  
in the single figure table above. 
4 The performance conditions for these awards are set out on page 78. 
Payments to Past Directors
No payments have been made in 2013 to past directors in respect of their services as a director of the Company. Bruce van Allen 
ceased to be a director on 8 January 2009 and continued to be employed by the Company until 31 March 2011. Mr van Allen's bonus 
in respect of 2009 was subject to deferral with a matching award under the deferred bonus plan in 2010 and that award was released 
and vested to Mr van Allen in May 2013.
Loss of Office Payments
No directors received any payments for loss of office during the year.

The table below shows the movement in total remuneration for the Chief Executive between the current and previous financial year 
compared to that of the total remuneration costs of relevant comparator employees as a whole. Relevant employees are employees  
of BBA Aviation plc and its subsidiaries who are in banded grades 1-4 - about 100 of the Group's senior leaders as the Board believes 
this is a more suitable comparator group. The Chief Executive's reward is made up of a larger proportion of variable pay than 
employees within this comparator group.

Directors' Shareholdings and Interests
In accordance with the Company's internal shareholding guidelines, the executive directors are expected to hold the equivalent of their 
annual salary in shares although there are no formal shareholding requirements in the articles of association of the Company. Both 
Simon Pryce and Mark Hoad have exceeded this expectation throughout the financial year and each owned as at 31 December 2013 
shares to the value of over 610% and 240% respectively. The calculation includes shares held by directors and their connected persons 
and, in accordance with the internal guidelines, conditional shares in the Deferred Bonus Plan where the risk of forfeiture has lifted.
Table 4A on page 76 shows the beneficial interests held by directors. Tables 4B - 4D on pages 76-77 of the report show the 
interests in schemes. The performance conditions are set out on page 78.
Relative Importance of Spend on Pay
The Board recognises that the level of spend on pay is driven partly by being within the service sector and the high number of 
employees relative to our size. The remuneration receivable by employees reflects this. The comparators below have been selected as 
they illustrate allocation of  profits' between amounts payable to directors, amounts returned to shareholders by way of dividends and

Directors' Report
Directors' Remuneration Report
Implementation of Policy in 2014
The policy on remuneration is due to be formally approved by shareholders at the May 2014 AGM.
In December 2013 the salaries of the executive directors were reviewed by the Remuneration Committee. It was agreed that  
the base salary for Simon Pryce to take effect from 1 January 2014 would increase by 2.5% to  589,375. Mark Hoad's salary will be 
unchanged at  325,000 following three years of larger than normal increases as set out in previous reports. The average base salary 
increase across the banded senior management population was 2.30% across the Group.
It is expected that the base salaries for executive directors will be reviewed in December 2014.
Non-executive directors fees have increased by 15% to  55,000 and took effect from 1 January 2014. These are not expected  
to be reviewed again until December 2016.
The Committee does not expect to change the Pension and Benefit arrangements for the executive directors in 2014.
For 2014 the Committee has determined that the annual bonus opportunity for executive directors and senior executives  
will again be contingent on meeting both financial targets and personal objectives. The Committee has reviewed targets for the  
year to ensure they remain appropriately stretching and relevant to the Company's business strategy. In 2014, financial performance 
objectives will again represent 84% of bonus opportunity and personal objectives 16%.
The Committee will ensure that the performance measures for any future awards made under the LTIP remain appropriately 
stretching in light of the Company's expectations of performance and those of external analysts. In 2014, Simon Pryce's LTIP award  
will be 190% of salary.
As noted in the Chairman's statement Mark Hoad will leave BBA Aviation plc on 30 June and will not be entitled to an LTIP award 
or a bonus in respect of 2014.

The Conditional awards are as a result of the deferred bonus plan. For directors, half of the bonus earned in any particular year is 
deferred into an award of conditional shares. In respect of this part of the bonus there are no additional performance conditions other  
than remaining employed by the Group at the date of vesting. These awards are matched with an award of Conditional Matching 
shares. There are no Conditional awards shown for 2010 as the shares were purchased and held in trust for the directors and those 
shares are disclosed in Table 4A.

Directors' Remuneration Report
Policy
Introduction
This section of the report describes BBA Aviation's remuneration policy for directors.
The following key principles govern the design of the Group's remuneration and reward structures:
   Relevance to BBA Aviation, the cyclicality of our businesses and the international markets in which we compete and operate.
   Pay for performance, notably the effective execution of the Group strategy and delivery of exceptional, long-term sustainable 
value for all our shareholders and stakeholders.
   Reward actions that support our vision, mission and values.
   Remuneration should be commensurate with role and responsibilities and sufficient to attract, retain and motivate high  
calibre individuals with relevant experience.
   Reward should be appropriate and easily understood, both internally and externally.
   For executive directors a significant element of remuneration should be aligned to long-term business performance.
   The reward structure is compatible with our risk policies and systems and must not create environmental, social or governance 
risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
The remuneration policy will take effect, subject to shareholder approval, from the close of the Company's AGM in May 2014.
All contractual commitments or awards made which are consistent with the remuneration policy in force at the time that the 
commitment or award was made will be honoured even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the policy prevailing  
when the commitment is fulfilled or awards vest. Any contractual commitments entered into or awards made before the Large  
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 came into force or before  
a person became a director will also be honoured. The tables below set out a clear and comprehensive summary of BBA Aviation's 
remuneration policy for directors and how it operates.

Annual cash 
and deferred 
bonus
Focuses on targets  
set over a 12 month 
period that are 
aligned to the delivery 
of the Group's 
long-term strategic 
objectives and 
include:
   Incentive for 
achievement of 
Group financial 
objectives; and
   Incentive for 
achievement of 
individual 
personal 
objectives.
The deferred bonus, 
paid in shares, ensures 
long-term alignment 
with shareholders' 
interests.
Bonus is delivered in 
cash and deferred 
shares.
The deferred shares 
are held for three 
years over which 
dividends may accrue 
and are released 
subject to continuing 
employment and 
normally vest over  
a three-year period.
The Remuneration 
Committee will 
operate the schemes 
in accordance with 
their respective rules 
and in accordance 
with the principles  
of the remuneration 
policy.
Maximum annual 
bonus is 150% of base 
salary with at least  
40% being deferred 
into shares.
The level of bonus paid 
each year is determined 
by the Remuneration 
Committee after the 
year end based on 
performance against 
targets:
Financial targets will 
normally account for 
not less than 70% of the 
potential maximum 
award; with personal 
objectives accounting 
for the remainder.
Examples of financial 
performance measures 
include operating  
profit and Group free 
cash flow. 
Examples of personal 
objectives include 
achievement of: specific 
strategic goals or KPIs.
Currently, at threshold 
financial performance, 
executives are entitled 
to a bonus of no more 
than 20% of salary in 
addition to any bonus 
for personal objectives.
At target financial 
performance, 
executives are entitled 
to 45% of salary and 
maximum performance 
105%, and on a straight 
line basis between 
these points.
At the 
discretion  
of the 
Remuneration 
Committee, 
unvested 
deferred share 
awards may  
be withheld  
or reduced in 
number in  
the event of  
a material 
financial 
misstatement.

Notes
1  The performance measures selected for the purposes of the annual bonus plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plans are either Key Performance 
Indicators for the Group or are selected in order to encourage and reward directly or indirectly sustainable and long-term shareholder value 
creation. Performance targets are set taking into account prior year performance, annual budgets, strategic imperatives, and external factors. 
 Threshold' performance is set taking into account the highly cyclical nature of our business and the variability of results from year to year and our 
dependence on flying hours. The  maximum' standard of performance is intended to be exacting and to represent a level of performance that 
places the Group among the best performers.

Directors' Report
Directors' Remuneration Report
2  The elements of remuneration for executive directors are similar to those that apply to the management banded population in the Group.  
Any differences that exist arise either because of market practice and/or the Remuneration Committee's assessment of business need and 
commercial necessity.
3  The Company also reimburses business expenses in accordance with the corporate business expenses policy which the Remuneration Committee 
has discretion to revise from time to time. 
4  In addition to other benefits, the Remuneration Committee, where necessary, will provide support in accordance with BBA Aviation's standard 
approach to relocation where a director is required to relocate to fulfil their responsibilities. The primary purpose of the policy is to facilitate 
recruitment and relocation of key employees by protecting the individual and their family from costs arising directly from a move of residence, 
required for business reasons. The elements of the policy include, but are not limited to, travel reimbursement of the cost of movement of 
household goods, housing, schooling and other reasonable costs.

The final awards under 
the Plan were made  
in May 2013 in respect  
of 2012 performance.
The purpose  
was to align 
executives' 
interests with 
shareholders' 
interests and 
Company 
performance.
The deferred element of the 
annual bonus was subject  
to a 1:1 match of further 
conditional shares that were 
subject to performance 
conditions set out on  
page 78.
The deferred shares normally 
vest over three years and  
are potentially subject to 
forfeiture in accordance  
with the scheme rules if  
the director leaves before 
vesting.
The final awards made in 
2013 will either vest or lapse 
in 2016.
The maximum 
match under each 
of the compulsory 
and voluntary 
elements was  
50% of the  
annual bonus.

Directors' Report
Directors' Remuneration Report
Levels of remuneration under the policy assuming different performance outcomes for 2014
For  mid-point' performance the chart below shows that:
   more than half of remuneration is performance related; and
   more than one third is linked to longer-term performance.
For maximum performance the chart below shows that:
   over 70% is performance related; and
   over 40% is linked to longer-term performance.
Half the annual bonus is deferred for three years and is subject to forfeiture.
As noted in the Chairman's statement Mark Hoad will leave BBA Aviation plc on 30 June and will not be entitled to an LTIP award or a 
bonus in respect of 2014. He will only receive his salary for half of the year and this is reflected in the graph above. This excludes any 
possible payments for loss of office.
For the purposes of this analysis the following assumptions have been made:
   Fixed elements comprise base salary and other benefits;
   Base Salary and benefits and pension reflect current levels:
   For the Group Chief Executive: base salary of  589,375, benefits of  21,000 and pension of  1 17 ,875;
   For the Group Finance Director: base salary of  325,000, benefits of  18,000 and pension of  65,000;
   For mid-point performance, an assumption of 50% of annual bonus is applied and 50% vesting for the LTIP has also been used. 
   No share price increase has been assumed.
 
Recruitment and Appointment Policy
This recruitment and appointment policy will apply if any of the following are appointed to the Board:
   External candidate;
   Internal candidate;
   A non-executive director being appointed as Chairman or to an executive role; or
   An executive director being promoted.
All of the components in the existing policy would be considered in developing an appropriate remuneration package  
in accordance with the principles set out on page 79 and taking into account the following additional considerations:
   A full range of factors including, but not limited to, the calibre of candidate, the level of existing remuneration, the jurisdiction  
the candidate is recruited from and into, and the individual's skills and experience.
   Internal relativities and appropriate market comparisons.
   Any awards or payments made in consideration for remuneration that may be foregone by an external candidate will generally  
be share-based and subject to forfeiture if the executive leaves within a set period after the appointment.
   The value assigned to any remuneration that may be foregone will take into account factors such as the vesting period and  
the probability of shares vesting and will be based on objective valuation methodologies.
As far as possible, the remuneration of new directors will be set in accordance with the existing directors' remuneration policy, 
however, the Committee retains discretion to:
   use the current Listing Rule 9.4.2R if required in order to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of a director  
but any arrangements of this kind will not exceed 400% of salary; and
   agree contract terms to reflect local market norms but will generally seek to apply the current policy in respect of contracts  
of employment and corporate governance guidelines.

BBA complete.indb 85 12/03/2014 12:45 Service contracts
The executive directors have contracts of employment which entitle them to 12 months' notice from the Company in the event  
of termination other than for cause. Executive Directors' contracts allow for termination with contractual notice from the Company  
or termination with a payment in lieu of notice, or an enforced period of paid garden leave at the Company's discretion. The Group 
Chief Executive is required to give the Company twelve months' notice and the Group Finance Director, six months.
The Chairman and the non-executive directors each have a letter of appointment. The Chairman's appointment letter  
entitles him to six months' notice from the Company and he is required to give the Company six months' notice. The Company may 
terminate the Chairman's contract immediately and pay him an amount in lieu of his fees for six months less statutory deductions.
Letters of appointment and service contracts are available for inspection by shareholders at each AGM and during normal 
business hours at the Company's registered office. 
There are no contractual commitments over and above those disclosed in this Policy.

Policy on payment for loss of office
In the event of termination of an executive director's contract the Company will comply with any applicable legislative or regulatory 
framework and will honour contractual commitments that have been made. The Company will seek to avoid making any payment  
for failure.
The Company takes into account the circumstances of termination and seeks to strike an appropriate balance, considering  
all relevant matters, that it believes are in the best interests of shareholders. 
In certain circumstances the executive directors may receive compensation on early termination of a contract which could 
amount to up to one year's base salary, benefits in kind and pension rights.
The contracts allow for phased payments to be made on termination and include an obligation on the former director to 
mitigate loss. This mechanism of phased payments allows for the amount of any phased payments to be reduced in circumstances 
where the former director secures a position during the period of phased payments.
A director who leaves as a result of poor personal performance will normally be treated differently than a director who leaves  
by reason of redundancy, retirement or ill health. The Company will not make any payments for loss of office in the event of gross 
misconduct.
The Remuneration Committee will operate the share schemes in accordance with their respective rules and in accordance  
with the principles of the remuneration policy (see table on page 87 for further details).
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to reach agreement with departing directors and approve additional 
payments in connection with the termination of a director's office or employment where such payment is in the interests  
of shareholders (including the settlement or compromise of any claim or threatened claim).
There is no contractual obligation to pay bonus which has not been superseded by the bonus rules and there is no entitlement 
to any bonus payments if an employee is under notice given or received at the end of the applicable financial year, although it is 
within the discretion of the Committee to award bonus, subject to the limits set out in the policy.
On termination, a non-executive director would normally receive his fee for the month of termination. The Chairman is entitled 
to six months' notice and benefits for that period if served notice by the Company.
The Company may purchase a small token leaving gift for departing directors.

Directors' Remuneration Report
The table below sets out how each component of the payment may be calculated.
Element of payment Basis of calculation 
Annual base salary Calculated on a contractual basis.
Pension and other 
benefits
Calculated on a contractual basis and where the pay in lieu of notice clause is invoked, an amount  
up to one year's accrued benefits.
The Committee also make modest payments relating to outplacements.
Annual incentive No bonus is paid in the case of dismissal for gross misconduct.
Ordinarily individuals are only entitled to bonus when reasons for leaving are including, and not limited 
to, retirement, death, ill health, redundancy, or sale of an employing entity. However the Remuneration 
Committee may exercise its discretion to pay bonus depending on the exact circumstances of the 
termination.
Bonus is not included in the calculation of any payment in lieu of notice.
Bonus is calculated in accordance with the rules of the plan.
Long-term incentives On a contractual basis and in accordance with the scheme rules.
Unvested shares lapse under the Long Term Incentive Plan on termination unless it is for a permitted 
reason (ill health, redundancy, etc.) or the Remuneration Committee makes use of the discretion under 
the rules of the plans to allow the shares to vest. Any vesting is subject to the substitution of performance 
targets and, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, through pro-rating to reflect  
the date of termination, relative to the performance periods of the outstanding shares.
Deferred shares under the annual bonus plan may or may not be forfeitable depending on the timing  
of the termination in the deferral periods. In the case of the unvested Deferred Bonus Matching shares 
the award may be awarded on termination for a permitted reason (e.g. ill health, redundancy etc) or at 
the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Any matching award will vest subject to performance 
conditions and, unless the Committee determines otherwise pro-rated for the period served as a  
director during the performance period at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
The contracts of the Group Chief Executive and the Finance Director preclude any right to other 
compensation for any loss of any share-based pay beyond the rules of the schemes.
Compensation for 
forfeited remuneration  
Upon termination, any  buy out' awards would normally lapse. However, the Remuneration Committee 
does retain the discretion to decide otherwise, provided the termination is not as a result of poor 
performance.
Other benefits, e.g. 
relocation allowances, 
international mobility 
benefits and expenses
Will depend on what has been agreed on appointment, but the Remuneration Committee would not 
expect any or all of these elements of pay to form part of any termination arrangement but has discretion 
to make payments in respect of them.
All employee equity 
participation plans
Directors will be treated in the same manner as any other member of staff in respect of those plans.

BBA complete.indb 87 12/03/2014 12:45 Change of Control
In the event of a change of control the Remuneration Committee will determine the extent to which any shares will vest taking into 
account all relevant factors including the performance criteria and the time elapsed since the date of grant. Directors will be entitled 
to receive their conditional shares from the deferred bonus where the risk of forfeiture has lifted.
Employment Conditions Elsewhere in the Company 
In determining remuneration, the Remuneration Committee is mindful of pay and conditions across the Group. Decisions concerning 
Executive Directors' pay and benefits are generally in line with the practices and framework across the Group. The Committee is 
briefed by the Group Chief Executive and Group HR Director on the overall pay and benefits framework for the Group and on changes 
made. The Remuneration Committee uses external remuneration comparison measurements.
Employees' Views
Employees have not been consulted on the directors' remuneration policy but are free to ask any questions they wish and to offer  
any opinions they have through our employee communications channels. Employees who are also shareholders are able to vote  
on the Directors' Remuneration Policy and Report.
Shareholders' Views
The Remuneration Committee supported by the Group HR Director actively engages with major institutional shareholders on a 
regular basis. Recent consultations have highlighted the preference of many shareholders for greater simplicity and streamlining  
of executive directors' pay and the evolution of BBA Aviation's policy reflects both the needs of the business and, as far as possible,  
the views of all our largest shareholders.
