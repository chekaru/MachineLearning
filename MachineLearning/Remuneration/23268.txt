 42 BBA GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2002
DIRECTORS' REPORT ON
REMUNERATION
Throughout 2002 the Company complied with the provisions of the
Combined Code (the Code ) annexed to the Listing Rules of the UK
Listing Authority, except in respect of the historic pensionability of
bonuses and benefits in kind, which is referred to below.
This report covers the remuneration policy for directors and
includes specific disclosures relating to directors' emoluments,
their shares and other interests. This remuneration report is
being put to shareholders at the forthcoming annual general
meeting for an advisory vote. Although the Board considers itself
ultimately responsible for both the framework and the cost of
executive remuneration, it has delegated prime responsibility for
executive remuneration to the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee is a Committee of the Board
consisting exclusively of independent non-executive directors
details of which are set out on page 39. It is responsible for
determining executive directors' remuneration and reviewing
proposals in respect of other senior executives. The Committee
also determines targets for performance related share schemes
operated by the Company and oversees any major changes in
employee benefit structures throughout the Group. Further details
of the work of the Remuneration Committee are set out on page 39.
A. REMUNERATION POLICY
The Group's remuneration policy is to ensure that executive
director's remuneration properly reflects their duties and
responsibilities and is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate
high calibre senior management collectively capable of delivering
the goals of the Company. Particular attention is given to the need
to remain competitive in the different geographic areas in which
the Company operates. Furthermore, the Committee aims to
ensure that incentive schemes are in line with best practice and
promote the interests of shareholders.
The main components of executive directors' remuneration
are basic salary, an annual performance related bonus scheme,
benefits, longer term incentives (in the form of share options,
restricted share awards and deferred annual bonus) and pension
provision. The Committee believes that the executive directors'
remuneration packages contain a suitable balance of directly
performance related remuneration which links both the short-
term financial performance of the Group and the long-term
shareholder return with the executive's total remuneration.
Executive directors remuneration is reviewed at least
annually whilst the Committee reviews its remuneration policy 
on an ongoing basis. 
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
Inbucon-Meis Limited, an independent remuneration consulting
firm, is regularly consulted by the Remuneration Committee and
executive management in respect of executive remuneration and
share schemes. Other than the calculation of total shareholder
return for the long-term incentive plan, which is provided by a
sister company Inbucon Administration Limited, Inbucon-Meis
Limited provides no other services to the Company. In carrying
out its responsibilities, the Committee also takes advice on
remuneration matters from Mercer, an independent consulting
firm. Mercer are not consulted by the executive management
team in respect of remuneration matters. Mercer's associated
retirement benefits consulting practice is used from time to time
on specific pension matters by the Company. In addition, following
a recent tender process, Mercer's retirement benefits consulting
practice was appointed as pension managers and administrators
by the Trustees of the Company's two UK pension plans.
The Committee also consults with the Chairman (who is 
not a member of the Remuneration Committee) and the 
Group Chief Executive about its proposals in relation to the
remuneration of the executive directors and is assisted in its 
work by the Group Secretary. 
Salary 
Salaries reflect the executive directors' experience, responsibility
and performance and are reviewed annually with reference to
external market data for similar roles. The policy of the
Committee is to provide salaries that are positioned between the
median and upper quartile when compared to the salary data.
While salary is reviewed by reference to market conditions, the
performance of the Company and the performance of the
individual, the Committee would not regard this element of
remuneration as directly performance related. The Committee
also has regard to employment conditions throughout the Group.
Bonus
Annual cash bonuses for executive directors and senior
management are based on the financial performance of the 
Group and personal objectives. A formula, recommended by 
and discussed with external consultants, is approved by the
Remuneration Committee. Financial targets and personal
objectives are set annually. Currently, approximately 75 per cent
of the maximum bonus is based on financial objectives. More
details of the bonus arrangements are set out below.
Long-Term Incentives
The Remuneration Committee believes that a significant element
of executive directors' remuneration should be linked to long-
term incentives. The Company's schemes have been developed to
reflect market practice and provide long-term management focus
and motivation. The Committee has also recognised the need for
flexibility in this area to allow them to respond to changing
market practices and different geographic norms. The Committee
believes that the two performance measures chosen for its
incentive schemes - eps growth and comparative total
shareholder return - each represent a reasonable long-term
indication of the financial success of the Company. They are also BBA GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2002 43
measures that are acceptable to the majority of the investors in
the Company. It is the current intention of the Committee that its
schemes retain these measures.
Benefits
Other benefits include company car or allowance, private medical
insurance, supplemental life insurance and long-term disability
insurance. The Committee does not regard this element of
remuneration as directly performance related.
Pension Provision
Pensions are considered to be an important element of
remuneration for the executive directors. Details of the pension
provision for the executive directors varies and reflects differing
UK and US practice. Further details are set out on page 49. 
From 31 March 2002, the Company's UK defined benefit plans
were closed to new entrants. All new employees from 1 April 2002
will be given the option of joining a defined contribution plan with
company contributions.

consider to be a suitable broad-based equity market index.

B. DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
Service Contracts and salary
Notice required to be given to executive directors' under their
service contracts are as follows:
R V McGlone contract dated 21 February 1996 one year's notice
A R Wood contract dated 13 February 2001 one year's notice 
B Van Allen contract dated 1 June 2000 one year's notice 
R H McMillan contract dated 1 June 2001, one year's notice after
1 June 2003, until then two years' notice 
Mr McMillan's contract was entered into prior to his joining the
Board in September 2002 and the Committee believes that it is
appropriate that the arrangements regarding his notice period
continue for the few remaining months. Mr Cartwright, who
retired from the Board in July 2002, had a two-year notice period
under his service contract dated 17 October 1990, pre-dating the
Cadbury requirements. 
The Remuneration Committee has considered what
compensation commitments, including pension contributions, 
the executive directors contracts would entail in the event of 
early termination other than for non-performance. In certain
circumstances, the executive directors may receive compensation
upon early termination of a contract. This could amount to up 
to one year's remuneration for Mr McGlone, Mr Wood and 
Mr Van Allen (with two years in the event of a change of control),
based on basic salary, bonus, benefits in kind and pension rights
during the notice period. For termination prior to 1 June 2003, 
Mr McMillan could receive up to two years remuneration and
thereafter his arrangements would be similar to the other
executive directors. The Remuneration Committee continues 
to endorse the principle of mitigation of damages on early
termination of a service contract. 
Mr McGlone and Mr Van Allen are required to give 12 months'
notice and the other executive directors 6 months' notice of
termination of their service agreements. 
Table 1 sets out details of the executive directors' salary and
non-executive directors' fees.
Bonus
Bonus payments made in respect of 2002 for Mr McGlone and 
Mr Wood were calculated on the basis of the Group's earnings per
share, return on net assets and the achievement of measurable
personal objectives. Mr Van Allen and Mr McMillan's bonus
reflects their operational responsibility for the Aviation and
Materials Technology businesses respectively. Their bonus
arrangements for 2002, during which year they joined the Board,
were based on the achievement of budgeted operating profit,
return on net operating assets, operating cashflow for the
relevant division, together with the achievement of measurable

personal objectives. The bonus for Mr Cartwright, who retired
during the year, was calculated on the same basis as Mr Van Allen
and Mr McMillan. For all executive directors, appropriate performance
targets and personal objectives were approved by the Committee at
the start of the financial year for which the bonus was payable. The
bonus was expressed as a percentage of salary and the potential
payout ranged from zero to a maximum of 65 per cent of salary.
Approximately 75 per cent of the bonus is based on financial objectives.
The Committee retains discretion to reflect exceptional circumstances
by varying bonuses. The performance measures were chosen by the
Committee because each measure was a factor over which the
individual had a direct impact and each of the measures are
collectively good indicators of corporate performance that should
link to long-term shareholder reward.
Bonus payments for 2003 are intended to be calculated on a
similar basis to 2002 except that the bonus for Mr Van Allen and 
Mr McMillan will include an element based on the Group's earnings per
share to reflect their Group responsibilities as directors of the Company.
Table 1 includes details of annual bonus payments made in
respect of 2002.
Benefits
The executive directors are provided with benefits in kind which
include company cars, private medical insurance, supplemental
life insurance and long-term disability insurance.
Long-Term Incentives
The Company operates a long-term incentive plan and share
option schemes.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
Following shareholder approval, the Company introduced the BBA
Group Long-Term Incentive Plan in 1997 for the most senior
executives in the Company. 
Under the plan, contingent awards of shares have been made
( Restricted Shares'), with further awards of shares ( Matched Shares')
being made pro rata to shares acquired by participants using their
annual bonus ( Investment Shares'). The interest in shares awarded
will only vest if the Company's targeted total shareholder return
(TSR - share price growth plus reinvested dividends) measured
over a period of three years is achieved. Above that minimum, the
interest will vest in whole or in part depending on the level of
achievement of the performance conditions. The Committee has
chosen TSR and earnings per share as the performance conditions
under this plan as it believes they are two of the most commonly
accepted measurements of long-term shareholder return. 
The performance conditions for the 1999 Awards require the
Company's TSR to rank in the upper quartile compared to the TSR
of a selected comparator group to achieve full vesting. A ranking
of median will result in 25 per cent of the award vesting. Between
the median and the 75th percentile, awards vest on a proportional
basis. No vesting occurs below the median. In addition, growth in
the Company's normalised earnings per share must exceed the
rate of inflation by an average of at least 2 per cent per annum
over the three-year performance period. Matched Shares will vest
under the same performance conditions as the Restricted Shares.
At the time of the grant, BBA Group was classified as an
Engineering company and the comparator group consisted of a
group of companies selected from the FT-SE Engineering Sector
Index and the FT-SE Engineering Vehicles Sector.
The comparator group in respect of the 1999 Awards at the
end of the performance period is detailed in the table below.
The Company's TSR ranking in respect of the 1999 Awards was
below the median at the end of the performance period resulting
in a nil vesting. As a result no Restricted and Matched shares
were released to the relevant directors.
Awards were also made in 2000 and 2001, but not 2002. For
2000 and 2001, the Company's TSR is measured against a larger
and broader comparator group than earlier awards. At the time of
grant, the Remuneration Committee selected companies within
the FTSE 350 with a market capitalisation of between
approximately  600 million and  10 billion and excluded certain
sectors such as banking, software and telecommunications.
The vesting of Restricted Shares is nil below the median, 
15 per cent at the median, 100 per cent at the upper quartile and
118 per cent at the top 20th percentile. Vesting of Matched Shares
is nil below the median, 15 per cent at the median and 100 per
cent at the upper quartile. In addition, earnings per share must
exceed the rate of inflation by 3 per cent per annum. 
The comparator groups in respect of the 2000 and 2001
awards at 31 December 2002 are set out on the facing page.
Share Option Schemes 
The executive share option schemes currently operated by the
Company, all of which include performance conditions, are:
  The BBA Group 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme
  The BBA Group 1994 Incentive Share Option Plan
  The BBA Group 1995 Executive Share Appreciation Rights Plan
The last two plans were introduced to facilitate the grant of
options to US participants.

Between 1997 and 2000, the executive directors did not receive
options under the Company's executive share option schemes.
Following a review by the Committee of the operation of these
schemes in the light of market conditions, during 2001
shareholders approved amendments to the 1994 executive share
option scheme and the facility was taken to grant a combination
of options and awards under the Company's Long-Term Incentive
Plan. Executive directors have since been granted options under
the amended 1994 executive share option scheme.
Under the 1994 executive share option scheme in any
financial year an executive director may be granted options with
an exercise price not exceeding two times annual
earnings.Options granted under the 1994 executive share option
plan are only exercisable if the growth in the Company's earnings
per share, as adjusted, for any period of three consecutive years
is at least 9 per cent and is greater than the growth in inflation.
Super options granted under the 1994 executive share option
plan are only exercisable if the growth in the Company's earnings
per share, as adjusted, for any period of five consecutive years is
greater than the growth in earnings per share, as adjusted,
achieved during the same five year period by at least three
quarters of those companies which constitute the FT-SE 100 index
at the end of the five year period. No super options have been
granted since 1997 and the recent amendments to the 1994
scheme removed the facility to grant such options.
The Performance Conditions in respect of the options
granted in 1999 were not satisfied and these options did not
become exercisable in 2002. In accordance with the Scheme
Rules, the performance conditions attached to these options will
be re-tested in 2003. As stated above, no executive directors were
granted options in 1999.
The Committee selected earnings per share as the measure
for the share option scheme as it is accepted as being a good
indicator of long-term corporate performance. TSR is not used as
a performance condition for the share option scheme, as it is with
the Long-Term Incentive Plan, as the Committee is of the view
that options have an inherent share price performance measure,
being the condition that before any reward is given the share price
must increase.
Executive directors are eligible to participate in the BBA
Group 1994 Savings-Related Share Option Scheme which is open
to all eligible UK employees. Options are granted under three or
five year SAYE contracts at a 20 per cent discount to the stock
market price at the offer date. The maximum overall employee
contribution is  250 per month.
Table 1 below sets out details of the emoluments and fees of
executive directors and non-executive directors, Table 2 sets out
share option holdings and Table 3 details Long-Term Incentive
Plan awards and directors' interests in shares are listed in Table 4.

Pension
Mr McGlone and Mr Wood participate in a UK defined benefit plan.
For Mr McGlone, who joined the plan prior to April 2000,
pensionable earnings are basic salary plus an average of three
years annual bonus together with taxable value of benefits in
kind. As a result of a review of the plan during 2000, as from April
2000 the bonus element of pensionable earning for existing
directors such as Mr McGlone was capped at 45 per cent of salary
and pensionable earnings for Mr Wood and other new participants 
comprise basic salary only. It is the Committee's policy that the
bonus of any new director joining the Company's UK pension plans
from April 2000 will not be pensionable. The Company's defined
benefit plans were closed to new entrants from 1 April 2002.
Mr McGlone and Mr Wood are restricted in the level of
benefits they can earn under the Group's pension plan by the
state defined earnings cap ( 97,200 for the tax year 2002/2003).
The Company therefore provides a funded unapproved retirement
benefits scheme ( FURBS') at its discretion for these directors.
The Company's FURBS are closely related to the contribution the
Company makes to the approved defined benefits scheme less
expenses and any special funding. The rates of contributions may
not be the same for each executive and for 2002 were in the range
of 20 - 40 per cent per annum of pensionable earnings in excess
of the earnings cap.
Mr. McMillan and Mr. Van Allen are participants in the
Group's Senior Executive Retirement Plan for North America
( SERP'). Upon retirement at age 65 they are entitled to receive a
lump sum benefit. That benefit is based upon a five-year averaging
of compensation, including bonus, less amounts received under
certain other employer pension plans which include 401k plans.
Mr Cartwright retired from the Board in July 2002 and during
his period as a director he participated in the Group's UK pension
plan on a similar basis to Mr McGlone, except that he was not
subject to the state defined earnings cap.
