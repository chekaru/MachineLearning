 DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT 
This report covers the remuneration policy for directors and includes 
specific disclosures relating to directors' emoluments, their shares and 
other interests. This remuneration report is being put to shareholders 
at the forthcoming annual general meeting for an advisory vote. 
Throughout 2004 the Company complied with the provisions of 
the July 2003 Combined Code (the Code ) annexed to the Listing Rules 
of the UK Listing Authority, except in respect of the historical 
pensionability of bonuses and benefits in kind, which is referred to in 
paragraph 3d below. This report includes information which is 
required to be audited and this information is stated as such in the 
relevant table. 
1. REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
Although the Board considers itself ultimately responsible for both the 
framework and the cost of executive remuneration, it has delegated 
prime responsibility for executive remuneration to the Remuneration 
Committee. 
The Remuneration Committee is a Committee of the Board 
consisting exclusively of independent non-executive directors, details 
of which are set out on page 45. It is responsible for determining 
executive directors' remuneration and reviewing proposals in respect 
of other senior executives. The Committee also determines targets for 
performance related share schemes operated by the Company and 
oversees any major changes in employee benefit structures 
throughout the Group. Further details of the work of the Remuneration 
Committee are set out on page 45. 
Inbucon Consulting, an independent remuneration consulting 
firm, is consulted by the Remuneration Committee and management in 
respect of executive remuneration and share schemes. Inbucon 
Consulting provides no other services to the Company other than the 
calculation of total shareholder return for the 2004 Share Plan. During 
the year management also consulted Mellon, an independent human 
resource consulting firm, in respect of its executive bonus schemes. 
In carrying out its responsibilities, the Remuneration Committee 
is independently advised by Sean O'Hare, Head of Executive 
Compensation at KPMG LLP . 
The Committee also consults with the Chairman (who is not a 
member of the Remuneration Committee), the Group Chief Executive 
and the Group Secretary in connection with its work. 
2. REMUNERATION POLICY 
The Group's remuneration policy is to ensure that executive directors' 
remuneration properly reflects their duties and responsibilities and is 
sufficient to attract, retain and motivate high calibre senior 
management collectively capable of delivering the goals of the 
Company. The Committee recognises the need to remain competitive 
in the different geographic areas in which the Company operates. 
Furthermore, the Committee aims to ensure that incentive schemes 
are in line with best practice and promote the interests of 
shareholders. Executive directors' remuneration is reviewed at least 
annually whilst the Committee reviews its remuneration policy on 
an ongoing basis. 
The main components of executive directors' remuneration are set out below. 
The Committee believes that the executive directors' remuneration packages 
contain a suitable balance of directly performance related remuneration 
which links both the short-term financial performance of the Group and the 
long-term shareholder return with the executive's total remuneration. 
a. Salary and Service Contract 
The policy of the Committee is to provide salaries that are positioned 
between the median and upper quartile when compared to salary data. 
While salary is reviewed by reference to market conditions, financial and 
individual performance, the Committee would not regard this element 
of remuneration as directly performance related. In addition to basic 
salary, Executive directors receive traditional benefits in kind, principally 
a company car or car allowance and private medical insurance. 
The policy of the Committee is to make new executive director 
appointments with a rolling service agreement which can be 
terminated by the Company on giving 12 months' notice. 
b. Bonus 
Annual cash bonuses for executive directors and senior management 
are based on financial performance and personal objectives which are 
set annually. Currently, approximately 75 per cent of the maximum 
bonus is based on financial objectives. More details of the bonus 
arrangements are set out below. 
c. Long-Term Incentives 
The Remuneration Committee believes that a significant element of 
executive directors' remuneration should be linked to performance 
related long-term incentives. The Company's schemes have been 
developed to reflect market practice and provide long-term 
management focus and motivation. The Committee has also 
recognised the need for flexibility in this area to allow them to respond 
to changing market practices and different geographic norms. 
As part of its strategy to align shareholders' and directors' 
interests, the Remuneration Committee will expect all executive 
directors to build and maintain a holding of shares with a value at least 
equal to their base salary. 
d. Pension Provision 
Pension provision for the executive directors varies and reflects 
differing UK and US practice. Further details are set out on page 55. 
The Company is reviewing the implications of the proposed 
changes to UK pension legislation. The Remuneration Committee will 
be developing its policy in this area during 2005 and will include details 
in next year's report. 
3. POLICY IMPLEMENTATION: DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION 
a. Salary and Service Contracts 
Base salaries are reviewed annually by reference to comparator 
groups selected on the basis of comparable size, geographic spread 
and business focus. Individual salary decisions take into account 
personal contribution, business performance and the level of pay 
awards elsewhere in the Group. 
BBA GROUP 
ANNUAL REPORT

2004  DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT 
Each executive director who served during the year has a 12 month 
notice period under his contract of employment. 
R V McGlone contract dated 21 February 1996 
A R Wood contract dated 13 February 2001 
B Van Allen contract dated 1 June 2000 
R H McMillan contract dated 1 June 2001 
In the event of early termination, the Remuneration Committee will, within 
legal constraints, determine the approach to be taken according to the 
circumstances of each individual case, taking account of the departing 
director's obligation to mitigate his loss. In certain circumstances, and 
except for termination for non-performance, the executive directors 
may receive compensation upon early termination of a contract which 
could amount to up to one year's remuneration based on basic salary, 
bonus, benefits in kind and pension rights during the notice period. 
Mr McGlone and Mr Van Allen are required to give 12 months' 
notice and the other executive directors 6 months' notice of termination 
of their service agreements. 
Table 1 (page 53) sets out details of the executive directors' salary and 
non-executive directors' fees. 
b. Bonus 
Bonus payments made in respect of 2004 for Mr McGlone and Mr Wood 
were calculated on the basis of the Group's adjusted earnings per share, 
Group free cash flow and the achievement of measurable personal 
objectives. Mr Van Allen's and Mr McMillan's bonuses reflect their 
operational responsibility for the Aviation Services and Materials 
Technology businesses respectively. Their bonus arrangements for 2004 
were based on the achievement of budgeted operating profit, return on 
net operating assets, operating cashflow for the relevant division, 
together with Group adjusted earnings per share and the achievement of 
measurable personal objectives. For all executive directors, appropriate 
performance targets and personal objectives were approved by the 
Committee at the start of the financial year for which the bonus was 
payable. The performance measures were chosen by the Committee 
because each measure was a factor over which the individual had a direct 
impact and each of the measures are collectively good indicators of 
corporate performance that should link to long-term shareholder reward. 
The bonus was expressed as a percentage of salary and the 
potential payout ranged from zero to a maximum of 65 per cent of salary. 
In a year where budgeted financial targets are met this would typically 
result in a payment of 27.5 per cent of basic salary. Approximately 
75 per cent of the bonus is based on financial objectives, the remainder 
on measurable personal objectives. The Committee retains discretion 
to reflect exceptional circumstances by varying bonuses. Bonus 
payments for 2005 are intended to be calculated on a similar basis to 
2004, except that for executive directors with operational responsibility 
return on net operating assets will be removed as one of the financial 
elements so as to give greater clarity in the financial targets. 
Table 1 (page 53) includes details of annual bonus payments made 
in respect of 2004. 
c. Share Scheme Incentives 
In April 2004, shareholders approved the BBA Group 2004 Long-Term 
Incentive Plan which replaces the previous BBA Group Long-Term 
Incentive Plan and the BBA Group 1994 Executive Share Option 
Scheme. Details of these plans are set out below. 
BBA Group 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
The BBA Group 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  2004 Plan') allows 
the awards of options, conditional shares and matching shares. The 
maximum number of options which an executive may be granted in any 
year is limited to three times basic salary, or four times basic salary if 
the Remuneration Committee determines that an executive will not 
receive a conditional share award in that year . Conditional awards of 
shares are limited to one times the executive's basic salary or two 
times basic salary if the Remuneration Committee determines that the 
executive will not be granted options in that year . For awards to be 
made in 2005, the maximum number of shares in respect of which an 
executive may be made a matching award will be limited to 50 per cent 
of the number of shares purchased by the executive using his or her 
net bonus. Each executive may purchase shares to a value not 
exceeding his or her gross annual bonus, subject to a minimum of 
25 per cent of net amount. The Plan rules also permit matching on 
a net to gross basis. 
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the maximum 
award levels are not excessive and are in line with current market 
practice. When making awards, the Remuneration Committee will take 
prevailing remuneration practice into account. 
Options granted in 2005 under the 2004 Plan will be subject to 
the following performance conditions, which will be measured from the 
financial year ending just prior to the grant over a three year period: 
Average EPS growth Proportion of options 
above inflation exercisable 
7% or more per annum 100% 
3 to 7% per annum Pro rata between 33% and 100% 
3% per annum 33% 
Less than 3% per annum Nil 
Options will lapse if performance conditions are not satisfied and there 
will be no retesting. In line with performance conditions under earlier 
Company share option schemes, the earnings per share calculation 
will be verified by the external auditors. 
Conditional shares will vest and be released to executives at the 
end of a three year period if the Company's total shareholder return 
against a comparator group of companies consisting of all of the FTSE 
350 listed companies in the transport, chemicals and aerospace and 
defence sectors is met. Awards made in 2005 will be subject to the 
following performance conditions: 
BBA GROUP 
ANNUAL REPORT 
50 
2004  TSR ranking in Proportion of shares vesting 
comparator group 
Upper quartile 100% 
Median to upper quartile Pro rata between 25% and 100% 
Median 25% 
Below Median Nil 
If median position is not achieved, the whole award will lapse and there 
will be no retesting. In line with performance conditions under previous 
conditional awards, total shareholder return will be calculated by an 
independent remuneration consulting firm. The vesting of matching 
awards is not dependent on performance conditions. 
The Committee believes that the two performance measures 
chosen for its incentive schemes - adjusted earnings per share growth 
and comparative total shareholder return - each represent a 
reasonable long-term indication of the financial success of the 
Company. They are also measures that are acceptable to the majority 
of the investors in the Company. It is the current intention of the 
Committee that its schemes retain these measures. 
No awards were made under the 2004 Plan during the year . 
BBA Group 1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
The BBA Group Long-Term Incentive Plan, approved by shareholders in 
1997, was replaced by the 2004 Plan during 2004. There are no 
outstanding awards under this Long-Term Incentive Plan. Contingent 
awards of restricted shares were made with further awards of matched 
shares being made pro rata to investment shares acquired by 
participants using their annual bonus. The interest in shares awarded 
could only vest if the Company's targeted total shareholder return 
measured over a period of three years was achieved. Above that 
minimum, the interest would vest in whole or in part depending on the 
level of achievement of the performance conditions. 
For awards made in 2001, the Company's TSR was measured 
against a comparator group of selected companies within the FTSE 350 
with a market capitalisation of between approximately  600 million and 
 10 billion, excluding certain sectors. In addition, adjusted earnings per 
share had to exceed the rate of inflation by 3 per cent per annum. The 
vesting of restricted shares was nil below the median, 15 per cent at the 
median, 100 per cent at the upper quartile and 118 per cent at the top 
20th percentile. Vesting of matched shares is nil below the median, 
15 per cent at the median and 100 per cent at the upper quartile. 
Awards made in 2001 resulted in a nil vesting in March 2004 
as the Company's TSR ranking was below the median at the end of the 
performance period. As a result no restricted shares were released to 
the relevant directors. The comparator group in respect of the 2001 
award at the end of the vesting period is set out at the top of this page.

Share Option Schemes 
All executive options recently awarded by the Company have been 
made under the BBA Group 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme, 
which expired in April 2004. All outstanding options granted under 
the scheme are subject to performance conditions. 
Between 1997 and 2000, the executive directors did not receive 
options under the Company's executive share option schemes. 
Executive directors were granted options under the scheme between 
2001 and 2004 when shareholder approved amendments facilitated 
grants of a combination of options and awards under the 1997 Long-

The charts below show the Company's total shareholder return over

be a suitable broad-based equity market index of which the Company 
is a constituent. Graph 1 shows the annual change in total shareholder 
return for the Company and the index, while Graph 2 shows the

Under the 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme, in any financial 
year a participant could be granted options with an exercise price not 
exceeding two times annual earnings. Such options are only exercisable 
if the growth in the Company's earnings per share, as adjusted, for any 
period of three consecutive years is at least 9 per cent and is greater 
than the growth in inflation. 
Super options granted under the 1994 executive share option plan 
are only exercisable if the growth in the Company's earnings per share,

growth in earnings per share, as adjusted, achieved during the same five

2004  d. Pension 
UK 
The executive directors participate in the Company's UK defined 
benefit plans. For Mr McGlone, who joined the plan prior to April 2000, 
pensionable earnings are basic salary plus an average of three years' 
annual bonus together with the taxable value of benefits in kind. 
As from April 2000, the bonus element of pensionable earnings for 
existing directors such as Mr McGlone was capped at 45 per cent of 
salary. Pensionable earnings for Mr Wood and other new participants 
comprise basic salary only. It is the Committee's policy that the bonus 
of any new director joining the Company's UK pension plans from April 
2000 will not be pensionable. 
Under the Defined Benefit Scheme Rules, the normal retirement 
age is 62. In the case of death before retirement, a contingent widow's 
pension equal to two thirds of the member's prospective pension is 
payable. Other dependents' pensions may also be paid. The Scheme 
Rules guarantee pension increases in retirement by RPI up to 5 per cent. 
Further discretionary increases are possible if RPI is above 5 per cent. 
Mr McGlone and Mr Wood are restricted in the level of benefits 
they can earn under the Group's pension plan by the state defined 
earnings cap ( 102,000 for the tax year 2004/2005). The Company 
therefore provides a funded unapproved retirement benefits scheme 
( FURBS') at its discretion for these directors. The Company's FURBS 
are closely related to the contribution the Company makes to the 
approved defined benefits scheme less expenses and any special 
funding. The rate of contribution for both Mr McGlone and Mr Wood 
was 36% per annum of pensionable earnings in excess of the earnings 
cap, although Mr McGlone has elected to receive a proportion of his 
entitlement as salary (see Table 1).

Mr McMillan and Mr Van Allen are participants in the Group's Senior 
Executive Pension Plan for North America ( SEPP'). Under the Plan, 
at age 62, they are entitled to receive a lump sum retirement benefit. 
The Plan also provides for a reduced benefit in the event of early 
retirement. That benefit is based upon a five-year averaging of 
compensation, including bonus, less amounts received under 
certain other employer pension plans which include 401k plans. 
From 1 January 2004 the Company funded the SEPP. 
In the case of death before retirement, the accrued benefit 
reverts to the participant's widow, and is paid in a lump sum. At the 
Company's discretion, a reduced early retirement benefit is available 
once the participant's age plus credited service exceeds 59. Increases 
in pension are not guaranteed under the Plan. 
Mr McMillan and Mr Van Allen also participate in the Group's 
401k plan. Details of the contributions made to the 401k plan are set 
out in Table 7 below. 
Mr Quarta, whilst an executive director, participated in a United 
States executive retirement plan. He retains benefits which accrued 
whilst he was an executive director . The main features of this plan 
included a normal retirement age of 60, no individual contributions 
and an annual benefit upon retirement equivalent to 50 per cent of the 
average of his highest three years' compensation, inclusive of bonus 
and taxable benefits in kind less amounts received under certain other 
employer pension plans.

Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration 
The non-executive directors each have a letter of appointment which is 
available on request. No compensation would be payable for the early 
termination of the appointment of any non-executive director . 
The level of fees is determined by the Board as a whole on the 
recommendation of the Group Chief Executive using independent 
market surveys. Fees are in line with current market practice of 
comparable organisations. During the year the annual base fee for 
non-executive directors increased to  30,000 and the annual supplement 
payable to the chairman of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration 
Committee increased to  7,500. It was also agreed that the Senior 
Independent Director should receive an annual supplement of  5,000. 
These increases reflect the increased commitments and demands 
placed upon each of the non-executive directors in performing their 
duties on the Board and its principal committees. 
Details of the non-executive directors' fees for 2004 are set out 
in Table 1 (page 53). 
At 23 February 2005, the unexpired terms of the non-executive 
directors were as follows: 
R Quarta 24 months D J S Roques 35 months 
J M Harper 36 months D Rough 24 months 
R M Phillips 14 months R N Stillwell 24 months 
I B Yoskowitz retired from the Board on 1 March 2004. 
The non-executive directors do not participate in the Company's share 
option schemes, long-term incentive plan or pension arrangements. 
As disclosed in this report Mr Quarta retains an entitlement to a 
pension which accrued whilst he was an executive director . Mr Quarta's 
rights to exercise certain share options granted whilst he was an 
executive director lapsed on 31 December 2004.
