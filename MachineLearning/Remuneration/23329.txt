This report covers the remuneration policy for directors and
includes specific disclosures relating to directors' emoluments,
their shares and other interests and is being put to shareholders
at the forthcoming annual general meeting for an advisory vote. 
Throughout 2005 the Company complied with the provisions
of the July 2003 Combined Code (the Code ) except in respect 
of the historical pensionability of bonuses and benefits in kind,
which is referred to in paragraph 3d below. This report includes
information which is required to be audited and this information
is stated as such in the relevant table.
1. REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Although the Board considers itself ultimately responsible for
both the framework and the cost of executive remuneration, it
has delegated prime responsibility for executive remuneration 
to the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee is a Committee of the Board
consisting exclusively of independent non-executive directors,
details of which are set out on page 45. It is responsible for
determining executive directors' remuneration and reviewing
proposals in respect of other senior executives. The Committee
also determines targets for performance related share schemes
operated by the Company and oversees any major changes in
employee benefit structures throughout the Group. Further
details of the work of the Remuneration Committee are set out
on page 45.
Inbucon Consulting, an independent remuneration-consulting
firm, is consulted by the Remuneration Committee and
management in respect of executive remuneration and share
schemes. Inbucon Consulting provides no other services to the
Company other than the calculation of total shareholder return
for the 2004 Share Plan.
In carrying out its responsibilities, the Remuneration
Committee is independently advised by Sean O'Hare, Head of
Executive Compensation at KPMG LLP. 
The Committee also consults with the Chairman (who is not 
a member of the Remuneration Committee), the Group Chief
Executive and the Group Secretary in connection with its work. 
2. REMUNERATION POLICY
The Group's remuneration policy is to ensure that executive
directors' and other senior executives' remuneration properly
reflects their duties and responsibilities and is sufficient to
attract, retain and motivate high calibre senior management
collectively capable of delivering the goals of the Company. 
The Committee recognises the need to remain competitive in 
the different geographic areas in which the Company operates.
Furthermore, the Committee aims to ensure that incentive
schemes are in line with best practice and promote the interests
of shareholders. Executive directors' remuneration is reviewed
at least annually whilst the Committee reviews its remuneration
policy on an ongoing basis. 
The main components of executive directors' remuneration
are set out below. Total executive remuneration is structured to
deliver potential upper quartile rewards for superior performance
with a significant proportion of variable pay subject to stretching
performance targets. The Committee believes that the executive
directors' remuneration packages contain a suitable balance of
directly performance related remuneration which links both the
short-term financial performance of the Group and long-term
shareholder returns with the executives' total remuneration. 
During 2006, the Remuneration Committee intends to
undertake a detailed formal review to ensure that its policy and
all components of remuneration are appropriate to the
Company's circumstances and prospects following the
separation of the Fiberweb Division from the Group.
a. Salary and Service Contracts
The policy of the Committee is to provide salaries that are
positioned around median when compared to salary data. While
salary is reviewed by reference to market conditions, financial
and individual performance, the Committee would not regard
this element of remuneration as directly performance related. 
In addition to basic salary, executive directors receive traditional
benefits in kind, principally a company car or car allowance,
private medical insurance and death in service benefits. 
The policy of the Committee is to make new executive
director appointments with a rolling service agreement which
can be terminated by the Company on giving 12 months' notice.
b. Bonus 
Annual cash bonuses for executive directors and senior
management are based on financial performance and personal
objectives which are set annually. Currently, approximately 
75 per cent of the maximum bonus is based on financial objectives.
More details of the bonus arrangements are set out below.
c. Long-Term Incentives
The Remuneration Committee believes that a significant
element of executive directors' remuneration should be linked 
to performance related long-term incentives. The Company's
schemes have been developed to reflect market practice and
provide long-term management focus and motivation. The
Committee has also recognised the need for flexibility in this
area to allow them to respond to changing market practices 
and different geographic norms. 
As part of its strategy to align shareholders' and directors'
interests, the Remuneration Committee will expect all executive
directors to build and maintain a holding of shares with a value
at least equal to their base salary. 
d. Pension Provision
Pension provision for the executive directors varies and reflects
differing UK and US practice. Further details are set out on 
page 55. The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the impact
of the changes to the tax treatment of UK pensions due to take
effect in April on current arrangements for UK based employees,
including the executive directors. Details of the pensions policy
Directors'
Remuneration
Report 50. BBA GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2005
and new arrangements for UK executives are set out on page 55.
The intention is that the new arrangements will not result in an
increase in the overall costs to the Company. 
3. POLICY IMPLEMENTATION: DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
a. Salary and Service Contracts
Base salaries are reviewed annually by reference to comparator
groups selected on the basis of comparable size, geographic
spread and business focus. Individual salary decisions take into
account personal contribution, business performance and the
level of pay awards elsewhere in the Group. Following a review
at the end of 2005, the Remuneration Committee approved a
base salary increase of 3.5 per cent for each of the executive
directors with effect from 1 January 2006.
Each executive director who served during the year has a
12 month notice period under his contract of employment. 
R V McGlone contract dated 21 February 1996
A R Wood contract dated 13 February 2001
B Van Allen contract dated 1 January 2004
Mr McMillan, who resigned from the Board in February 2005,
also had a 12 month notice period under his contract dated
1 January 2004.
In the event of early termination, the Remuneration Committee
will, within legal constraints, determine the approach to be
taken according to the circumstances of each individual case,
taking account of the departing director's obligation to mitigate
his loss. In certain circumstances, and except for termination
for non-performance, the executive directors may receive
compensation upon early termination of a contract which could
amount to up to one year's remuneration based on basic salary,
bonus, benefits in kind and pension rights during the notice
period. Mr Van Allen is required to give 12 months' notice and
Mr Wood 6 months' notice of termination of their service
agreements.
Table 1 (page 53) sets out details of the executive directors'
salary and non-executive directors' fees.
b. Bonus
Bonus payments made in respect of 2005 for Mr McGlone and
Mr Wood were calculated on the basis of the Group's adjusted
earnings per share, Group free cash flow and the achievement of
measurable personal objectives. Mr Van Allen's bonus reflects
his operational responsibility for the Aviation Services business.
His bonus arrangement for 2005 was based on the achievement
of budgeted operating profit, operating cashflow for the Aviation
Services Division, together with Group adjusted earnings per 
share and the achievement of measurable personal objectives.
For all executive directors, appropriate performance targets and
personal objectives were approved by the Committee at the start
of the financial year for which the bonus was payable. The
performance measures were chosen by the Committee because
each measure was a factor over which the individual had a direct
impact and each of the measures are collectively good indicators
of corporate performance that should link to long-term
shareholder reward.
The bonus was expressed as a percentage of salary and the
potential payout ranged from zero to a maximum of 65 per cent
of salary. In a year where budgeted financial targets are met this
would typically result in a payment of 27.5 per cent of basic
salary. Approximately 75 per cent of the bonus is based on
financial objectives, the remainder on measurable personal
objectives. The Committee retains discretion to reflect
exceptional circumstances by varying bonuses.
Table 1 (page 53) includes details of annual bonus payments
made in respect of 2005.
c. Share Scheme Incentives
In April 2004, shareholders approved the BBA Group 2004 Long-
Term Incentive Plan which replaces the previous BBA Group
Long-Term Incentive Plan, the BBA Group 1994 Executive Share
Option Scheme and the 1995 Share Appreciation Rights Plan.
Details of these plans are set out below.
BBA Group 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
The BBA Group 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  2004 Plan')
allows the awards of options, conditional shares and matching
shares. The maximum number of options which an executive
may be granted in any year is limited to three times basic salary,
or four times basic salary if the Remuneration Committee
determines that an executive will not receive a conditional share
award in that year. Conditional awards of shares are limited to
one times the executive's basic salary or two times basic salary
if the Remuneration Committee determines that the executive
will not be granted options in that year. Awards made to
executive directors in 2005 were limited to one times basic
salary for conditional awards and two times basic salary for
options. The Remuneration Committee consider the award levels
appropriate and in line with its policy to reward superior
performance with potential upper quartile remuneration.
The maximum number of shares in respect of which a
participant may be made matching awards in any year will be
limited to 50 per cent of the number of shares purchased with
his or her own money. Each executive may purchase shares to a
value not exceeding his or her gross annual bonus, subject to a
minimum of 25 per cent of net amount. The Plan rules also
permit matching on a net to gross basis. 
Directors'
Remuneration
Report 51.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the maximum
award levels are not excessive and are in line with current
market practice. When making awards, the Remuneration
Committee will take prevailing remuneration practice into
account. 
Options granted in 2005 under the 2004 Plan are subject to
the following performance conditions, which will be measured
from the financial year ending just prior to the grant over a three
year period:
Average EPS growth Proportion of options
above inflation exercisable
7% or more per annum 100%
3 to 7% per annum Pro rata between 33% and 100%
3% per annum 33%
Less than 3% per annum Nil
Options will lapse if performance conditions are not satisfied
and there will be no re-testing. In line with performance
conditions under earlier Company share option schemes, the
external auditors will perform certain agreed upon procedures
on the earnings per share calculation. The Remuneration
Committee will also seek external advice with regard to the
approach to adopt to take account of the move to International
Accounting Standards and the effect this has on earnings per
share based performance conditions and will endeavour to
ensure that performance is measured on a consistent basis.
Conditional shares will vest and be released to executives at
the end of a three year period if the Company's total shareholder
return against a comparator group of companies consisting of
all of the FTSE 350 listed companies in the industrial
transportation, travel and leisure, chemicals and aerospace and
defence sectors is met.
Awards made in 2005 are subject to the following performance
conditions:
TSR ranking in Proportion of shares vesting
comparator group
Upper quartile 100%
Median to upper quartile Pro rata between 25% and 100%
Median 25%
Below Median Nil
If median position is not achieved, the whole award will lapse
and there will be no retesting. In line with performance
conditions under previous conditional awards, total shareholder
return will be calculated by an independent remuneration-
consulting firm. The vesting of matching awards is not
dependent on performance conditions. 
The Committee believes that the two performance measures
chosen for its incentive schemes - adjusted earnings per share
growth and comparative total shareholder return - each
represent a reasonable long-term indication of the financial
success of the Company. They are also measures that are
acceptable to the majority of the investors in the Company.
The performance measures in respect of the share incentive
schemes will be reviewed in 2006 as part of the detailed review
referred to on page 49.
The comparator group in respect of the 2005 award of
conditional shares is as follows:
Comparator Group 2005 Awards
Arriva Go-Ahead Group
Associated British Ports Holdings Imperial Chemical Industries 
Avis Europe Johnson Matthey
BAA Meggitt
BAE Systems Mersey Docks & Harbour Co
BBA Group National Express Group
BOC Group Northgate
British Airways Penninsular & Oriental Steam 
British Vita Navigation Company
Cobham Rolls-Royce Group 
Croda International Smith Group
EasyJet Stagecoach Group
Exel Ultra Electronics Holdings
FirstGroup VT Group
Forth Ports Yule Catto & Co
The Committee will be considering the composition of the
comparator group in respect of awards to be made in 2006.
Details of awards made to the Executive Directors under the
2004 Plan during the year are set out in Tables 3 and 4.
Share Option Schemes
All executive options awarded by the Company prior to 2005 have
been made under the BBA Group 1994 Executive Share Option
Scheme, which expired in April 2004. All outstanding options
granted under the scheme are subject to performance
conditions. Prior to March 2002, the BBA Group 1995 Executive
Share Appreciation Rights Plan was used to facilitate the grant
of options to US executives on the same basis as the 1994
Executive Share Option Scheme.
Between 1997 and 2000, the Executive Directors did not
receive options under the Company's executive share option
schemes. Executive directors were granted options under the
scheme between 2001 and 2004 when shareholder approved
amendments facilitated grants of a combination of options and
awards under the 1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the latter of
which is now closed, with no outstanding awards).
Under the 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme, in any
financial year a participant could be granted options with an
exercise price not exceeding two times annual earnings. Such
options are only exercisable if the growth in the Company's
earnings per share, as adjusted, for any period of three
consecutive years is at least 9 per cent greater than the
growth in inflation.
  52. BBA GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2005
Super options granted under the 1994 executive share option
plan are only exercisable if the growth in the Company's
earnings per share, as adjusted, for any period of five
consecutive years is greater than the growth in earnings per
share, as adjusted, achieved during the same five year period by
at least three-quarters of those companies which constitute the
FTSE 100 index at the end of the five year period. No super
options have been granted since 1997 and the 2001
amendments to the 1994 scheme removed the facility to grant
such options.
Performance conditions in respect of options granted in
1999, 2000 and 2001 were not satisfied and did not become
exercisable at the end of their respective initial performance
periods. As required under the Scheme rules, the performance
conditions attached to these grants were re-tested in 2005 and
satisfied. In addition, the performance conditions attached to the
2002 grant of options were satisfied in 2005 and these options
also became exercisable. As stated above, performance
condition re-testing is not permitted under the 2004 Plan.
The Committee selected earnings per share as the
performance measure for the 1994 Executive Share Option
Scheme and the 1995 Share Appreciation Rights Plan as it is
accepted as being a good indicator of long-term corporate
performance. Options have an inherent share price performance
measure, being the condition that before any reward is given the
share price must increase.
Executive directors may be eligible to participate in the BBA
Group 2004 Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, which is
open to all eligible UK employees. Options are granted under
three or five year SAYE contracts at a 20 per cent discount to the
stock market price at the offer date. The maximum overall
employee contribution is  250 per month.
Performance Charts

Committee considers to be a suitable broad-based equity
market index of which the Company is a constituent. Graph 1

Notes
1. The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year.
2. The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN 11. 
The transfer value represents a liability of the Company / pension scheme not a sum due or paid to a director.
3. The increase in transfer values between 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2005 is as a result of changes in pensionable salary, one year extra service, increase in the 
age of the directors and effects of changes in market conditions.

d. Pension 
UK
Through the year under review, Mr McGlone and Mr Wood
participated in the Company's UK defined benefit plans.
For Mr McGlone, who joined the plan prior to April 2000,
pensionable earnings are basic salary plus an average of three
years' annual bonus together with the taxable value of benefits
in kind. As from April 2000, the bonus element of pensionable
earnings for existing directors such as Mr McGlone was capped
at 45 per cent of salary. Pensionable earnings for Mr Wood and
other new participants comprise basic salary only. It is the
Committee's policy that the bonus of any new director joining
the Company's UK pension plans from April 2000 will not be
pensionable.
Under the Defined Benefit Plan Rules, the normal retirement
age is 62. In the case of death before retirement, a contingent
widow's pension equal to two thirds of the member's prospective
pension is payable. Other dependant's pensions may also be
paid. The Plan Rules guarantee pension increases in retirement
by RPI up to 5 per cent. Further discretionary increases are
possible if RPI is above 5 per cent.
All the Company's UK Defined Benefit Plans were closed to
new entrants from April 2002; new employees from that date have
the option to join a Company sponsored Defined Contribution Plan
provided through an external investment manager. The Company
matches the employee's contribution in a range of 3 per cent to
7.5 per cent up to the state defined Earnings Cap.
Mr McGlone and Mr Wood were restricted in the level of
benefits they can earn under the Group's pension plan by the
state earnings cap ( 105,600 for the tax year 2005/2006) and
therefore the Company has provided a funded unapproved
retirement benefits scheme ( FURBS') at its discretion for these
directors. The Company's FURBS is closely related to the
contribution the Company makes to the approved Defined
Benefits Plan less expenses and any special funding. The rate
of contribution for both Mr McGlone and Mr Wood was 36 per
cent per annum of pensionable earnings in excess of the
earnings cap, although Mr McGlone has elected to receive a
proportion of his entitlement as salary (see Table 1). On 5 April
2006, the FURBS arrangements will cease as a result of the
Simplification  regulations under the Finance Act 2004. 
From 6 April 2006 revised arrangements will apply to all
the Company's UK pension arrangements as a result of both
the Finance Acts 2004 and 2005 and the Pensions Act 2004.
The Company and the Plan Trustee in respect of the Defined
Benefit Plan have agreed that a Notional Earnings Cap  will be
implemented in place of the state earnings cap in order to limit
the Company's exposure to increases in both Defined Benefit
liabilities and additional matching Defined Contribution
contributions. Directors and other employees whose earnings
are above the Notional Earnings Cap will be given a choice of
either a contribution to the Defined Contribution Plan or a cash
replacement equivalent to the contribution that would have been
paid to a FURBS. Executive directors who are close to or already
at the Lifetime Allowance under the new Simplification 
legislation may opt to withdraw from the Company's pension
arrangements and receive instead a neutral cost  cash
compensation.
US
Mr Van Allen participates in the Group's Senior Executive
Pension Plan for North America ('SEPP'). Mr McMillan, whilst
an executive director of the Company also participated in the
SEPP. The Company has funded the SEPP since January 2004.
  56. BBA GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2005
Under the Plan, at age 62, both Mr Van Allen and Mr McMillan
are entitled to receive a lump sum retirement benefit. The Plan
also provides for a reduced benefit in the event of early
retirement. Mr. McMillan's SEPP benefit became fixed on 14
November 2005 when he began new employment. Mr. McMillan
has elected to receive an early retirement benefit to be paid on 1
May 2006. That benefit is based upon a five-year averaging of
compensation, including bonus, less amounts received under
certain other employer pension plans, which include 401k plans. 
In the case of death before retirement, the accrued benefit
reverts to the participant's widow, and is paid in a lump sum.
At the Company's discretion, a reduced early retirement benefit
is available once the participant's age plus credited service
exceeds 59. Increases in pension are not guaranteed under
the Plan.
Mr Van Allen also participates in the Group's 401k plan.
Mr McMillan also participated in the 401k plan whilst he was
an executive director and continued that participation until
14 November 2005. Details of the contributions made to the
401k plan are set out in Table 7 (page 55).
Mr Quarta, whilst an executive director, participated in a
United States executive retirement plan. He retains benefits
which accrued whilst he was an executive director. The main
features of this plan included a normal retirement age of 60, no
individual contributions and an annual benefit upon retirement
equivalent to 50 per cent of the average of his highest three
years' compensation, inclusive of bonus and taxable benefits in
kind less amounts received under certain other employer
pension plans.
Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration 
The non-executive directors each have a letter of appointment
which is available on request. No compensation would be
payable for the early termination of the appointment of any
non-executive director.
The level of fees is determined by the Board as a whole on
the recommendation of the Group Chief Executive using
independent market surveys. Fees are in line with current 
market practice of comparable organisations. The Chairman of
the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee each
receive an annual supplement of  7,500. The Senior Independent
Director receives an annual supplement of  5,000. The
supplements reflect the increased commitments and demands
placed upon each of the non-executive directors in performing
their duties on the Board and its principal committees.
Non-executive directors fees were last reviewed in 2004.
Details of the non-executive directors' fees for 2005 are set out
in Table 1 (page 53). 
The dates of appointment or subsequent re-appointment and
unexpired term of the non-executive directors as at 20 March
2006 are set out below:
Date of Appointment / Re-appointment Unexpired Term as at 
20 March 2006
R Quarta 1 March 2004 11 months
R M Phillips 5 May 2004 1 month
D J S Roques 11 January 2005 22 months
D Rough 1 March 2004 11 months
R N Stillwell 1 March 2004 11 months
As mentioned on page 43 the Board intends to renew Mr
Phillips' appointment as a non-executive director for a further
term of one year with effect from 5 May 2006. Directors retiring
by rotation and standing for re-election at the forthcoming
annual general meeting are also shown on page 43.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the Company's
share option schemes, long-term incentive plan or pension
arrangements. As disclosed in this report Mr Quarta retains an
entitlement to a pension which accrued whilst he was an
executive director.
