   BBI Holdings Plc Annual Report 2007 17
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which introduced 
new statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors' remuneration.
The regulations require the auditors to report to the company's members on the  auditable part' of the directors' 
remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the regulations). The report has therefore been divided into 
separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration committee
The committee meets as required to set the remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment of executive 
directors and the company's policy on remuneration of the senior executives within terms of reference agreed by the 
board. The committee consists of its chairman Kevin Wilson, David Evans and Jonathan Gregory. 
Remuneration policy
The committee follows certain fundamental principles in deciding levels of remuneration. This includes providing base 
salary, which refl ects the current stage of development of the group, and aligning the interests of those executives with 
those of its shareholders through the use of share options and bonuses linked to, amongst other things, the development 
of the group. The remuneration of non-executives is determined by the board as a whole.
Basic salary
This is determined by the committee generally during March each year; in addition to basic salary, the executive 
directors receive other benefi ts, mainly car allowance and private medical insurance.
Incentive schemes/share option schemes
The executive directors can be eligible for an annual performance bonus based on the performance of the group and a
number of quantitative and qualitative factors including the fi nancial results and prospects of the company. The committee 
has reviewed various methods of providing long-term incentives, and it remains satisfi ed that, for the present, given the 
size and nature of the group, share options remain the incentive which is best aligned to shareholder interests.
Pensions
The group operates a group personal plan for all employees and executive directors who wish to participate.
