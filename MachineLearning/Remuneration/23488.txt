 Board report on directors' remuneration (continued)
In addition, the directors will grant A M Allkins options over such a number of shares as is equal to the
difference between 140,000 and the number of shares over which options are granted under the JEB
1994 Share Option Scheme above on 1 June 2003, over ordinary shares in Beale PLC at an exercise
price based on the average of the middle market quotations for an ordinary share as derived London
Stock Exchange daily official list for the previous three days under an unapproved share option contract
between EFG Reads Trustees Limited, as trustee of the Beale Employees' Share Trust, and A M Allkins. 
Subject to the attainment of performance targets, the option is exercisable between the third and tenth
anniversary of grant. 
The above option grants were part of A M Allkins' initial recruitment package and, pursuant to 13.13 of
the Listing Rules, no formal shareholder approval is required.
Should the 1 June 2003 be in the close period, the options will be granted on the first working day
outside the close period.
(v) Sharesave schemes
These schemes were adopted at the annual general meeting in March 1999.  On 4 May 1999, options
were granted to eligible employees at a 20% discount to the market price.
(vi) Pension benefits
The executive directors, T R Rathbone, A K Owst and M C H Mitchell (resigned 23 July 2002), were non-
contributory members of the final salary section of the Group's occupational pension scheme, which is
approved by the Inland Revenue.  Bonus payments and benefits in kind are not pensionable.
The scheme provides for enhanced benefits for executive directors, namely a normal retirement age of
60, an accrual rate of 1/45 final salary for each year of service, life assurance cover of four times
pensionable salary plus a spouse's pension following death in service, a spouse's pension after
retirement and a pension on early retirement due to ill health of 2/3 final salary.  Spouses' pensions of
one half of directors' pensions are payable on death after retirement.
Under the terms of M C H Mitchell's contract, he could retire at any time after he reached the age of 53,
on 30 April 2002, without application of an early retirement factor but only on the years of service accrued
to the date of retirement.

Notes:
1. The accrued entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on
service to the end of the year and excludes any revaluation which would apply for the period
up to retirement if the director had withdrawn from the scheme at the end of the year.
2. The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes price inflation.
3. M C H Mitchell resigned on 23 July 2002.  His accrued entitlement is shown as at retirement.
N D Jones was a contributory member of the defined contribution section and, during the year, the
Company contributed  3,180 on his behalf.  The Company contributed  5,335 to A M Allkins' personal
pension scheme.
45 Board report on directors' remuneration (continued)
(vii) Service contracts
The committee has noted the requirements of the Combined Code to reduce notice periods to a
maximum of one year and this is the Group's current policy in relation to appointments from April 2000.   It
is of the view that it is inappropriate to change rolling two-year contracts for existing executive directors
appointed prior to the introduction of the Code.
The remuneration committee has considered it inappropriate to quantify damages payable in the event of
service contracts being terminated.  It concluded that this would only be beneficial if termination followed
a change in control of the Company and, in such an event, up to two years' salary has been agreed as
an appropriate estimate.
(viii) Non-executive directors
The fees are set annually on 1 January by the Board as a whole and, apart from expenses incurred in
pursuit of their duties and normal staff discount arrangements, the non-executive directors do not receive
any other benefit.  The non-executive directors have been appointed on a fixed term three-year contract,
terminable on three months' notice by either party.
 (ix) Related party transactions
No director had a material interest in a contract, other than a service contract, with the Company or its
subsidiaries during the year.

2003.
(xii) Share option plans
The Company operates three share option plans. 
In relation to the JEB 1994 Share Option Scheme, options which were granted in 1995 were subject to
performance related conditions set by the remuneration committee which have already been fulfilled.  The
options were not granted at a discount.
Options granted on 1 July 2002 to A M Allkins are exercisable from 1 July 2005 to 1 July 2012.
Options granted on 1 July 2002 are subject to performance related conditions set by the remuneration
committee, and are exercisable only following growth in earnings per share over a three year period in
excess of the retail price index, subject to adjustments for exceptional and extraordinary items.  The
options were not granted at a discount.
The Sharesave schemes enabled all eligible employees, including directors, to acquire options over
ordinary shares at a discount of up to 20% of their market price using the proceeds of a related save as
you earn contract.
In relation to the unapproved share option scheme, see note (iv) above.
