Board Report on Directors' Remuneration 
General
Unaudited information
The remuneration committee comprises Alison H Richards (chairman) and J M H Sexton, both of whom are independent non-
executive directors of the Company, and who have no personal or financial interest in the matters decided. Other directors
attend by invitation when appropriate. The remuneration of the non-executive directors is fixed by the Board as a whole.
The committee seeks to ensure that executive directors receive a remuneration package sufficient to recruit, retain and
motivate persons of the right calibre.
The remuneration committee makes recommendations to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, on the Company's
framework of executive remuneration and its cost; and determines a specific remuneration and benefit package for each
executive director.
(i) Salary and benefits
Executive directors' salaries are reviewed annually on 1 August with regard to levels of remuneration and performance
relative to comparable companies within the department store/retail sector, growth in returns to shareholders through
earnings per share and capital growth and the contribution of the individual director. In addition, the committee
considers average staff pay increases and the provision in directors' service contracts for a minimum increase of 50%
of the increase in the retail price index.
Benefits for the year provided were a fully funded company car, permanent and private health insurance and discount
on merchandise purchased in the stores.
(ii) Bonus
The executive directors participate under the terms of a bonus scheme where the bonus is only payable if a profit before
tax target set by the remuneration committee is achieved. In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to guarantee
a bonus in order to recruit a director. If executive directors qualify for a bonus, the level of payment would be based on the
percentage annual increase in Group profitability and, where appropriate, the achievement of specific objectives laid down
by the committee. The bonus paid to A M Allkins during the financial year resulted from his recruitment.
(iii) Share options under the JEB 1994 Share Option Scheme
Certain directors have been granted options under the JEB 1994 Share Option Scheme. The options were not
granted at a discount and were subject to performance criteria as noted on page 47.
The committee aims to ensure that any future long-term incentive schemes are designed to promote Company and
shareholder interests and to align the interests of directors and shareholders.
(iv) Share options granted in 2003
On 30 June 2003, A M Allkins was granted an option over 140,000 ordinary shares in Beale PLC at an exercise price
of 86.5p under an unapproved share option contract between EFG Reads Trustees Limited, as trustee of the Beales
Employees' Share Trust, and A M Allkins. Subject to the attainment of performance targets which the remuneration
committee regard as challenging and will enhance shareholder value, the option is exercisable between the third and
tenth anniversary of grant. The trustees will, in due course, acquire shares purchased in the market to satisfy the
option when exercised.
The above option grant was part of A M Allkins's initial recruitment package and, pursuant to 13.13 of the Listing
Rules, no formal shareholder approval is required. 45 BEALE PLC Report & Accounts 2003

(v) Sharesave schemes
These schemes were adopted at the annual general meeting in March 1999. On 4 May 1999, options were granted
to eligible employees at a 20% discount to the market price.

(vi) Pension benefits
The executive directors, T R Rathbone, A K Owst and N D Jones, were contributory members of the final salary
section of the Group's occupational pension scheme, which is approved by the Inland Revenue. Bonus payments and
benefits in kind are not pensionable.
The scheme provides for enhanced benefits for executive directors, namely a normal retirement age of 60, an accrual
rate of 1/45 final salary for each year of service, life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary plus a spouse's
pension following death in service, a spouse's pension after retirement and a pension on early retirement due to ill
health of 2/3 final salary. Spouses' pensions of one-half of directors' pensions are payable on death after retirement.
Increase in Accumulated total
Age at accrued pension accrued pension as at
year end in the year 1 November 2003
  
A K Owst 47 3,300 18,200
T R Rathbone 51 5,200 41,300
N D Jones 39 1,800 1,800
Notes:
1. The accrued entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end
of the year and excludes any revaluation which would apply for the period up to retirement if the director had
withdrawn from the scheme at the end of the year.
2. The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes price inflation.
The Company contributed  34,125 (2002  5,335) to A M Allkins's personal pension scheme.
Unaudited information
(vii) Service contracts
The committee has noted the requirements of the Combined Code to reduce notice periods to a maximum of one
year and this is the Group's current policy in relation to appointments from April 2000. It is of the view that it is
inappropriate to change rolling two-year contracts for two existing executive directors appointed prior to the
introduction of the Code.
The remuneration committee has considered it inappropriate to quantify damages payable in the event of service
contracts being terminated. It concluded that this would only be beneficial if termination followed a change in control
of the Company and, in such an event, up to two years' salary has been agreed as an appropriate estimate. 46

non-executive directors are usually appointed on a fixed term three-year contract, terminable on three months'
notice by either party.

at a discount.

Options granted on 30 June 2003 to A M Allkins are exercisable from 30 June 2006 to 30 June 2013.
Options granted on 1 July 2002 and 30 June 2003 are subject to performance related conditions set by the
remuneration committee, and are exercisable only following growth in earnings per share over a three year period in
excess of the retail price index, subject to adjustments for exceptional and extraordinary items. The options were not
granted at a discount.
The Sharesave schemes enabled all eligible employees, including directors, to acquire options over ordinary shares
at a discount of up to 20% of their market price using the proceeds of a related save as you earn contract. 48
