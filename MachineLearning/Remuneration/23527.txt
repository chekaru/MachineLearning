 38 BEALE PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2004
Board Report on Directors' Remuneration
General
Unaudited information
The remuneration committee comprises Alison Richards (chairman) and Mike Killingley, both of whom are independent non-
executive directors of the Company and who have no personal or financial interest in the matters decided. Other directors
attend by invitation when appropriate. The remuneration of the non-executive directors is fixed by the Board 
as a whole.
The committee seeks to ensure that executive directors receive a remuneration package sufficient to recruit, retain and
motivate persons of the right calibre.
The remuneration committee makes recommendations to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, on the Company's
framework of executive remuneration and its cost; and determines a specific remuneration and benefit package for each
executive director. Only directors on the remuneration committee were involved in reviewing executive directors'
remuneration.
(i) Salary and benefits
Executive directors' salaries are reviewed annually on 1 August with regard to levels of remuneration and performance
relative to comparable companies within the department store/retail sector, growth in returns to shareholders through
earnings per share and capital growth and the contribution of the individual director. In addition, the committee
considers average staff pay increases and the provision in directors' service contracts for a minimum increase of 50%
of the increase in the retail price index.
Benefits for the year provided were a fully funded company car, permanent and private health insurance and discount
on merchandise purchased in the stores.
(ii) Bonus
The executive directors participate under the terms of a bonus scheme where the bonus is only payable if a profit
before tax target set by the remuneration committee is achieved. If executive directors qualify for a bonus, the level of
payment would be based on the annual increase in Group profitability and, where appropriate, the achievement of
specific objectives laid down by the committee. 
(iii) Share options under the JEB 1994 Share Option Scheme
Certain directors have been granted options under the JEB 1994 Share Option Scheme. The options were not granted
at a discount and were subject to performance criteria as noted on page 41.
The committee aims to ensure that any future long-term incentive schemes are designed to promote Company and
shareholder interests and to align the interests of directors and shareholders.
(iv) Share options granted in 2003
On 30 June 2003, Allan Allkins was granted an option over 140,000 ordinary shares in Beale PLC at an exercise price
of 86.5p under an unapproved share option contract between EFG Reads Trustees Limited, as trustee of the Beales
Employees' Share Trust, and Allan Allkins. Subject to the attainment of performance targets which the remuneration
committee regard as challenging and will enhance shareholder value, the option is exercisable between the third and
tenth anniversary of grant. The trustees will, in due course, acquire shares purchased in the market to satisfy the option
when exercised.
The above option grant was part of Allan Allkins' initial recruitment package and, pursuant to 13.13 of the Listing Rules,
no formal shareholder approval is required. 39

(v) Sharesave schemes
These schemes were adopted at the annual general meeting in March 1999. On 4 May 1999, options were granted to
eligible employees at a 20% discount to the market price.
(vi) Other non-executive responsibilities for executive directors
Ken Owst holds a non-executive position for which he receives no fees.
Audited information
(vii) Pension benefits
The executive directors, Neil Jones, Ken Owst and Tim Rathbone (resigned 27 August 2004), were contributory
members of the final salary section of the Group's occupational pension scheme, which is approved by the Inland
Revenue. Bonus payments and benefits in kind are not pensionable.
The scheme provides for enhanced benefits for executive directors, namely a normal retirement age of 60, an accrual
rate of 1/45 final salary for each year of service, life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary plus a spouse's
pension following death in service, a spouse's pension after retirement and a pension on early retirement due to ill
health of 2/3 final salary. Spouses' pensions of one half of directors' pensions are payable on death after retirement.

Notes:
1. The accrued entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of 
the year and excludes any revaluation which would apply for the period up to retirement if the director had
withdrawn from the scheme at the end of the year.
2. The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes price inflation.
3. Tim Rathbone resigned on 27 August 2004. His accrued entitlement is shown as at retirement.
The Company contributed  35,280 (2003:  34,125) to Allan Allkins' personal pension scheme.
Unaudited information
(viii)Service contracts and letters of appointment
The committee has noted the requirements of Clause B.1.6 of the July 2003 FRC Code whereby directors' contracts
should be set at one year or less. This has been the Group's current policy in relation to appointments from April 2000.
It is of the view that it is inappropriate to change a rolling two-year contract for one existing executive director
appointed prior to the introduction of the Hampel Code.
The remuneration committee has considered it inappropriate to quantify damages payable in the event of service
contracts being terminated. It concluded that this would only be beneficial if termination followed a change in control of
the Company and, in such an event, up to two years' salary has been agreed as an appropriate estimate. 40 BEALE PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2004

(ix) Non-executive directors

duties and normal staff discount arrangements, the non-executive directors do not receive any other benefit. The non-
executive directors are usually appointed on a fixed term three-year contract, terminable on three months' notice by
either party.
(x) Related party transactions
No director had a material interest in a contract, other than a service contract, with the Company or its subsidiaries

(xiii)Share option plans
The Company operates three share option plans. 
In relation to the JEB 1994 Share Option Scheme, options which were granted in 1995 were subject to performance
related conditions set by the remuneration committee which have already been fulfilled. The options were not granted
at a discount.
Options granted on 30 June 2003 to Allan Allkins are exercisable from 30 June 2006 to 30 June 2013.
Options granted on 1 July 2002 and 30 June 2003 were subject to performance related conditions set by the
remuneration committee, and are exercisable only following growth in earnings per share over a three year period in
excess of the retail price index, subject to adjustments for exceptional and extraordinary items. The options were not
granted at a discount. The options granted on 1 July 2002 have lapsed because the Group failed to achieve the
related performance conditions.
The Sharesave schemes enabled all eligible employees, including directors, to acquire options over ordinary shares at
a discount of up to 20% of their market price using the proceeds of a related save as you earn contract. 42 BEALE PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2004

(xiv) Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the
performance of the FTSE Small Cap Index also measured by total shareholder return. The FTSE Small Cap Index has
been selected for this comparison because Beale PLC's stockbrokers Rowan Dartington have advised it is a
comparator for performance.
