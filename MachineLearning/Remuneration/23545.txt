 Board Report on
Directors' Remuneration
35
General
Unaudited information
The remuneration committee comprises Alison Richards (chairman) and Mike Killingley, both of whom are
independent non-executive directors of the Company and who have no personal or financial interest in the
matters decided. Other directors attend by invitation when appropriate. The remuneration of the non-executive
directors is fixed by the Board as a whole.
The committee seeks to ensure that executive directors receive a remuneration package sufficient to recruit,
retain and motivate persons of the right calibre.
The remuneration committee makes recommendations to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, on the
Company's framework of executive remuneration and its cost; and determines a specific remuneration and
benefit package for each executive director. Only directors on the remuneration committee were involved in
reviewing executive directors' remuneration.
(i) Salary and benefits
Executive directors' salaries are reviewed annually on 1 August with regard to levels of remuneration and
performance relative to comparable companies within the department store/retail sector, growth in returns to
shareholders through earnings per share and capital growth and the contribution of the individual director. In
addition, the committee considers average staff pay increases and the provision in directors' service
contracts for a minimum increase of 50% of the increase in the retail price index.
Benefits provided to directors for the year were a fully funded company car, permanent and private health
insurance and discount on merchandise purchased in the stores.
(ii) Bonus
The executive directors participate under the terms of a bonus scheme where the bonus is only payable if a
profit before tax target set by the remuneration committee is achieved. 
(iii) Share options under the JEB 1994 Share Option Scheme
Certain directors have been granted options under the JEB 1994 Share Option Scheme. The options were
not granted at a discount and were subject to performance criteria.
The committee aims to ensure that any future long-term incentive schemes are designed to promote
Company and shareholder interests and to align the interests of directors and shareholders. These options
have now lapsed.
(iv) Share options granted in 2003
On 30 June 2003, Allan Allkins was granted an option over 140,000 ordinary shares in Beale PLC at an
exercise price of 86.5p under an unapproved share option contract between EFG Reads Trustees Limited,
as trustee of the Beales Employees' Share Trust, and Allan Allkins. Subject to the attainment of performance
targets which the remuneration committee regarded as challenging and would enhance shareholder value,
the option was exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of grant. These options have now lapsed
because the Group failed to achieve the performance target.
(v) Sharesave schemes
These schemes were adopted at the annual general meeting in March 1999. On 4 May 1999, options were
granted to eligible employees at a 20% discount to the market price. These Sharesave scheme options have
now lapsed.
(vi) Other non-executive responsibilities for executive directors

(vii) Pension benefits
The executive directors Neil Jones and Ken Owst were contributory members of the final salary section of
the Group's occupational pension scheme, which is approved by the Inland Revenue. Bonus payments and
benefits in kind are not pensionable.
The scheme provides for enhanced benefits for executive directors, namely a normal retirement age of 60,
an accrual rate of 1/45 final salary for each year of service, life assurance cover of four times pensionable
salary plus a spouse's pension following death in service, a spouse's pension after retirement and a pension
on early retirement due to ill health of 2/3 final salary. Spouses' pensions of one-half of directors' pensions
are payable on death after retirement. In common with other members, pensions related to service prior to 
6 April 1997 are increased by 5% p.a. and pensions related to subsequent service are increased in line with
the Retail Prices Index (subject to a maximum of 5% p.a.).

Notes:
1. The accrued entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to
the end of the year and excludes any revaluation which would apply for the period up to retirement if the
director had withdrawn from the scheme at the end of the year.
2. The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes price inflation.
3. Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with actuarial Guidance Note 11 that was current at
the end of each financial year.
4. The Company contributed  36,480 (2004:  35,280) to Allan Allkins' personal pension scheme and
 14,467 to Hilary Santell's personal pension scheme.

(viii) Service contracts and letters of appointment
The committee has noted the requirements of clause B.1.6 of the July 2003 FRC Code whereby directors'
contracts should be set at one year or less. This has been the Group's policy in relation to appointments
from April 2000. It is of the view that it is inappropriate to change a rolling two-year contract for one existing
executive director appointed prior to the introduction of the Hampel Code.
The remuneration committee has considered it inappropriate to quantify damages payable in the event of
service contracts being terminated. It concluded that this would only be beneficial if termination followed a
change in control of the Company and, in such an event, up to two years' salary has been agreed as an
appropriate estimate.

(ix) Non-executive directors
The fees are set annually on 1 August by the Board as a whole and, apart from expenses incurred in pursuit
of their duties and normal staff discount arrangements, the non-executive directors do not receive any other
benefit. The non-executive directors are usually appointed on a fixed term three-year contract, terminable on
three months' notice by either party.
(x) Related party transactions
No director had a material interest in a contract, other than a service contract, with the Company or its
subsidiaries during the year.
