 48 Beale PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006
Board Report on Directors' Remuneration
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985. The report also meets the
relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the
principles relating to directors' remuneration. As required by the Companies Act 1985, a resolution to approve the report will
be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Companies Act 1985 requires the auditors to report to the Company's members on certain parts of the directors'
remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and
unaudited information.

Remuneration committee
The members of the committee are Alison Richards and Mike Killingley, who are both independent non-executive directors;
Alison Richards chairs the committee. 
Neither member of the committee has any personal financial interest (other than as a shareholder), conflicts of interests
arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. The committee makes recommendations
to the Board. No director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
In determining the directors' remuneration for the year, the committee consulted Allan Allkins (Chief Executive) about its
proposals. The committee also appointed PA Consulting Group to provide advice on structuring directors' remuneration
packages. PA Consulting Group did not provide any other services to the Company or Group.
Remuneration policy for the executive directors
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the high calibre needed
to maintain the Group's position and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The performance measurement of
the executive directors and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the committee.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors:
 basic annual salary;
 benefits in kind;
 annual bonus payments which cannot exceed 75% of basic salary; and
 pension arrangements.
The Company's policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be performance
related. As described below, executive directors may earn annual incentive payments of up to 75% of their basic salary.
Executive directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company provided that the Board's permission is first sought.
Basic salary
Executive directors' salaries are reviewed annually on 1 August with regard to levels of remuneration and performance
relative to comparable companies within the department store/retail sector, growth in returns to shareholders through
earnings per share and capital growth, and the contribution of the individual director. In addition, the committee considers
average staff pay increases and the provision in directors' service contracts for a minimum increase of 50% of the increase in
the Retail Prices Index.
Benefits in kind
The executive directors receive certain benefits in kind, principally a fully funded company car, permanent and private health
insurance and discount on merchandise purchased in store.
Bonus
The executive directors participate under the terms of a bonus scheme where the bonus is only payable if a profit before tax
target set by the remuneration committee is achieved.

Pension arrangements
The executive directors Neil Jones and Ken Owst were contributory members of the final salary section of the Group's
occupational pension scheme, which is registered with HM Revenue and Customs. Bonus payments and benefits in kind are
not pensionable.
13035bealesplc:13035bealesplc  6/2/07  10:33  Page 48 49
The scheme provides for enhanced benefits for two executive directors, namely a normal retirement age of 60, an accrual
rate of 1/45 final salary for each year of service, life assurance cover, plus a spouse's pension following death in service and
a spouse's pension after retirement. Mr Owst is entitled to a pension on early retirement due to ill health of 2/3 final salary.
Spouses' pensions of one-half of directors' pensions are payable on death after retirement. In common with other members,
pensions related to service prior to 6 April 1997 are increased by 5% per annum and pensions related to subsequent service
are increased in line with the Retail Prices Index (subject to a maximum of 5% per annum).

Notes:
(a) The accrued entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the
year and excludes any revaluation which would apply for the period up to retirement if the director had withdrawn from
the scheme at the end of the year.
(b) The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes price inflation.
(c) Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with actuarial Guidance Note 11 that was current at the end of
each financial year. The basis on which transfer values are calculated, and adjusted to reflect the deficit within the
scheme, was updated during the year, increasing the transfer values disclosed at the year end.
(d) The Company contributed  74,042 (2005:  36,480) to Allan Allkins' personal pension scheme. Barbara King joined the
money purchase section of the Group's occupational pension scheme on 1 May 2006 and the Company contributed
 3,800 to her pension in the financial year.

Service contracts and letters of appointment
The committee has noted the requirements of clause B.1.6 of the July 2003 FRC Code whereby directors' contracts should
be set at one year or less. This has been the Group's policy in relation to appointments from April 2000. It is of the view that
it is inappropriate to change a rolling two-year contract for one existing executive director appointed prior to the introduction
of the July 2003 FRC Code.
The remuneration committee has considered it inappropriate to quantify damages payable in the event of service contracts
being terminated. It concluded that this would only be beneficial if termination followed a change in control of the Company
and, in such an event, up to two years' salary has been agreed as an appropriate estimate.

Non-executive directors
All non-executive directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the
limits set by the Articles of Association and based on independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors of similar
companies. The basic fee paid to each non-executive director in the year is set out below. The non-executive directors do
not receive additional fees in respect of the membership of the remuneration committee, nomination committee and audit
committee. Non-executive directors cannot participate in any of the Company's future share option schemes and are not
eligible to join the Company's pension scheme.
