Board Report on Directors' Remuneration
44 Beale PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2007
14561 08/02/2008 Proof 4
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985. The report also meets the relevant requirements of
the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to directors' remuneration.
As required by the Companies Act 1985, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at
which the financial statements will be approved.
The Companies Act 1985 requires the auditors to report to the Company's members on certain parts of the directors' remuneration report and
to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. The report
has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.

Remuneration committee
At the start of the year the members of the committee were Alison Richards and Mike Killingley, who are both independent non-executive
directors; with Alison Richards chairing the committee. Because of Alison Richards' illness, Nigel Beale was co-opted onto the remuneration
committee during the year, and Mike Killingley became acting chairman of the committee.
Neither member of the committee has any personal financial interest (other than as a shareholder), conflicts of interests arising from cross-
directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. The committee makes recommendations to the Board. No director plays a part
in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
In determining the directors' remuneration for the year, the committee consulted Allan Allkins (Chief Executive) about its proposals.
Remuneration policy for the executive directors
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the high calibre needed to maintain the
Group's position and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The performance measurement of the executive directors and the
determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the committee.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors:
 basic annual salary;
 benefits in kind;
 annual bonus payments which cannot exceed 75% of basic salary; and
 pension arrangements.
The Company's policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be performance related. As
described below, executive directors may earn annual incentive payments of up to 75% of their basic salary.
Executive directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company provided that the Board's permission is first sought.
Basic salary
Executive directors' salaries are reviewed annually on 1 November with regard to levels of remuneration and performance relative to comparable
companies within the department store/retail sector, growth in returns to shareholders through earnings per share and capital growth and the
contribution of the individual director. In addition, the committee considers average staff pay increases and the provision in directors' service
contracts for a minimum increase of 50% of the increase in the Retail Prices Index.
Benefits in kind
The executive directors receive certain benefits in kind, principally a fully funded company car, permanent and private health insurance and
discount on merchandise purchased in store.
Bonus
The executive directors participate under the terms of a bonus scheme where the bonus is only payable if a profit before tax target set by the
remuneration committee is achieved.

Pension arrangements
The executive directors Neil Jones and Ken Owst were contributory members of the final salary section of the Group's occupational pension
scheme, which is registered with HM Revenue and Customs. Bonus payments and benefits in kind are not pensionable.
The scheme provides for enhanced benefits for two executive directors, namely a normal retirement age of 60, an accrual rate of 1/45 final
salary for each year of service, life assurance cover, plus a spouse's pension following death in service, if applicable, and a spouse's pension
after retirement. Ken Owst is entitled to a pension on early retirement due to ill health of 2/3 final salary. Spouses' pensions of one half of
directors' pensions are payable on death after retirement. In common with other members, pensions related to service prior to 6 April 1997 are
increased by 5% per annum and pensions related to subsequent service are increased in line with the Retail Prices Index (subject to a maximum
of 5% per annum).

the financial year.

Service contracts and letters of appointment
The committee has noted the requirements of clause B.1.6 of the June 2006 FRC Code whereby directors' contracts should be set at one year
or less. This has been the Group's policy in relation to appointments from April 2000. It is of the view that it is inappropriate to change a rolling
two-year contract for one existing executive director appointed prior to the introduction of the June 2006 FRC Code.
The remuneration committee has considered it inappropriate to quantify damages payable in the event of service contracts being terminated. It
concluded that this would only be beneficial if termination followed a change in control of the Company and, in such an event, up to two years'
salary has been agreed as an appropriate estimate.

Non-executive directors
All non-executive directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by the
Articles of Association and based on independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors of similar companies. The basic fee paid to
each non-executive director in the year is set out below. The non-executive directors do not receive additional fees in respect of the
membership of the remuneration committee, nomination committee and audit committee. Non-executive directors cannot participate in any of
the Company's future share option schemes and are not eligible to join the Company's pension scheme.
