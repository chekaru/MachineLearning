Board Report on Directors' Remuneration
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulation 2002. The report also meets 
the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the 
principles relating to directors' remuneration. As required by the regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at 
the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulation 2002 requires the auditors to report to the Company's members on certain parts 
of the directors' remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the regulations. The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited 
information.

Remuneration committee
At the start of the year the members of the committee were Alison Richards and Mike Killingley, who were both independent 
non-executive directors, with Alison Richards chairing the committee. Because of Alison Richards' illness, Nigel Beale had been 
co-opted on to the remuneration committee from March 2007, and Mike Killingley became acting chairman of the committee. On 
23 September 2008 Keith Edelman, who is an independent non-executive director, became chairman of the committee.
Neither member of the committee has any personal financial interest (other than as a shareholder), conflicts of interests arising 
from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. The committee makes recommendations to the 
Board. No director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
In determining the directors' remuneration for the year, the committee consulted the chief executive about its proposals. 
Remuneration policy for the executive directors
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the high calibre needed to 
maintain the Group's position and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The performance measurement of the 
executive directors and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the committee.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors:
l basic annual salary;
l benefits in kind;
l annual bonus payments which cannot exceed 75% of basic salary; and
l pension arrangements.
The Company's policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be performance 
related. As described below, executive directors may earn annual incentive payments of up to 75% of their basic salary.
Executive directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company provided that the Board's permission is first sought.
Basic salary
Executive directors' salaries are reviewed annually on 1 October with regard to levels of remuneration and performance relative to 
comparable companies within the department store/retail sector, growth in returns to shareholders through earnings per share and 
capital growth and the contribution of the individual director. In addition, the committee considers average staff pay increases and 
the provision in directors' service contracts for a minimum increase of 50% of the increase in the Retail Prices Index.
Benefits in kind
The executive directors receive certain benefits in kind, principally a fully funded company car, permanent and private health 
insurance and discount on merchandise purchased in store.
Bonus
The executive directors participate under the terms of a bonus scheme where the bonus is only payable if a profit before tax target 
set by the remuneration committee is achieved.

Pension arrangements
The executive directors Neil Jones and Ken Owst were contributory members of the final salary section of the Group's 
occupational pension scheme, which is registered with HM Revenue & Customs. Bonus payments and benefits in kind are not 
pensionable.
The scheme provides for enhanced benefits for two executive directors, namely a normal retirement age of 60, an accrual rate of 
1/
45 final salary for each year of service, life assurance cover, plus a spouse's pension following death in service, if applicable, and 
a spouse's pension after retirement. Mr Owst is entitled to a pension on early retirement due to ill health of 
2/
3 final salary. Spouses' 
pensions of one-half of directors' pensions are payable on death after retirement. In common with other members, pensions 
related to service prior to 6 April 1997 are increased by 5% per annum and pensions related to subsequent service are increased 
in line with the Retail Prices Index (subject to a maximum of 5% per annum).

Service contracts and letters of appointment
The committee has noted the requirements of clause B.1.6 of the June 2006 FRC Code whereby directors' contracts should be 
set at one year or less. This has been the Group's policy in relation to appointments from April 2000. It is of the view that it is 
inappropriate to change a rolling two-year contract for one existing executive director appointed prior to the introduction of the 
June 2006 FRC Code.
The remuneration committee has considered it inappropriate to quantify damages payable in the event of service contracts being 
terminated. It concluded that this would only be beneficial if termination followed a change in control of the Company and, in such 
an event, up to two years' salary has been agreed as an appropriate estimate.

Non-executive directors
All non-executive directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the 
limits set by the Articles of Association and based on independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors of similar 
companies. The basic fee paid to each non-executive director in the year is set out below. The non-executive directors do not 
receive additional fees in respect of the membership of the remuneration committee, nomination committee or audit committee. 
Non-executive directors cannot participate in any of the Company's future share option schemes and are not eligible to join the 
Company's pension scheme.

Share option plans
During the year there were no share option plans in operation, all previously allocated options having lapsed in 2005.
Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the performance 
of the FTSE Small Cap Index also measured by total shareholder return. The FTSE Small Cap Index has been selected for this 
comparison because the Company's stockbrokers, Blue Oar Securities Plc, have advised it is an appropriate comparator for 
performance.
