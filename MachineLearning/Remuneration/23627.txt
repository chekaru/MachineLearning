BOARD REPORT ON DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulation 2002. The report also meets the relevant 
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to 
directors' remuneration. As required by the regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting 
of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulation 2002 requires the auditors to report to the Company's members on certain parts of the 
directors' remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the regulations. The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.

Remuneration committee
The members of the committee are Keith Edelman and Mike Killingley, who are both independent non-executive directors, with Keith 
Edelman chairing the committee. 
Neither member of the committee has any personal financial interest (other than as a shareholder), conflicts of interests arising from cross-
directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. The committee makes recommendations to the Board. No director plays 
a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
In determining the directors' remuneration for the year, the committee consulted the Chief Executive about its proposals. 
Remuneration policy for the executive directors
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the high calibre needed to maintain 
the Group's position and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The performance measurement of the executive directors 
and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the committee.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors:
z basic annual salary;
z benefits in kind;
z annual bonus payments; and
z pension arrangements.
The Company's policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be performance related. 
Executive directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company provided that the Board's permission is first sought.
Basic salary
Executive directors' salaries are reviewed annually on 1 October with regard to levels of remuneration and performance relative to 
comparable companies within the department store/retail sector, growth in returns to shareholders through earnings per share and capital 
growth and the contribution of the individual director. In addition, the committee considers average staff pay increases and the provision in 
directors' service contracts for a minimum increase of 50% of the increase in the Retail Prices Index.
Benefits in kind
The executive directors receive certain benefits in kind, private health insurance and discount on merchandise purchased in store. Ken 
Owst and Barbara King had fully funded company cars up to 13 July 2009 and 27 August 2009 respectively. Tony Brown had a fully 
funded company car throughout the year.

Bonus
The executive directors participate in an annual bonus scheme whereby Tony Brown can earn a bonus of up to 100% of his salary and 
Ken Owst can earn a bonus of up to 60% of his salary. This scheme is self-financing and is based primarily on achieving demanding profit 
targets; the scheme also provides for an element payable at the discretion of the remuneration committee. The bonuses which accrued in 
respect of 2009 were discretionary.
Both executive directors also participate in the Medium Term Bonus Scheme (MTBS) which runs for the three years ending 31 October 
2011. The amounts which accrue to the directors under the MTBS are equal to their annual bonuses from the above scheme. The 
medium-term bonuses are only payable if the directors are in Beale PLC employment, are not working their notice period and have not 
tendered their resignation, when the bonus becomes payable in January 2012.
The relevant profit targets were not achieved in the year ended 31 October 2009.

Pension arrangements
Two executive directors, Neil Jones and Ken Owst, were contributory members of the final salary section of the Group's occupational 
pension scheme up to 7 November 2008 and 30 April 2009 respectively, which is registered with HM Revenue & Customs. The final salary 
pension scheme was closed to further accrual on 30 April 2009. Bonus payments and benefits in kind are not pensionable.
The scheme provided for enhanced benefits for two executive directors, namely a normal retirement age of 60, an accrual rate of 
1/
45 final 
salary for each year of service, life assurance cover, plus a spouse's pension following death in service, if applicable, and a spouse's pension 
after retirement. Ken Owst is entitled to a pension on early retirement due to ill health of 
2/ 3 final salary. Spouses' pensions of one-half of 
directors' pensions are payable on death after retirement. In common with other members, pensions related to service prior to 6 April 1997 
are increased by 5% per annum and pensions related to subsequent service are increased in line with the Retail Prices Index (subject to a 
maximum of 5% per annum).

Service contracts and letters of appointment
The committee has noted the requirements of clause B.1.6 of the June 2008 FRC Code whereby directors' contracts should be set at one 
year or less. This has been the Group's policy in relation to appointments from April 2000. One director is on an eighteen month contract 
which will be gradually reduced to a one year contract by 1 November 2010.
The remuneration committee has considered it inappropriate to quantify damages payable in the event of service contracts being terminated. 
It concluded that this would only be beneficial if termination followed a change in control of the Company and, in such an event, up to 
eighteen months' salary has been agreed as an appropriate estimate.
   Date of contract Unexpired term Notice period

Non-executive directors
All non-executive directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by 
the Articles of Association and based on independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors of similar companies. The basic fee 
paid to each non-executive director in the year is set out below. The non-executive directors do not receive additional fees in respect of 
their membership of the remuneration committee, nomination committee or audit committee. Non-executive directors cannot participate 
in any of the Company's future share option schemes and are not eligible to join the Company's pension scheme.
