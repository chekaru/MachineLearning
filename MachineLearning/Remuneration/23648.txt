Board Report on Directors' Remuneration
This report has been prepared in accordance with schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008. The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and 
describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to directors' remuneration. As required by the regulations, a resolution to 
approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The 2008 regulation requires the auditors to report to the Company's members on certain parts of the directors' remuneration report 
and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the regulations. The 
report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.

Remuneration committee
The members of the committee are Keith Edelman and Mike Killingley, who are both independent non-executive directors, with Keith 
Edelman chairing the committee. 
Neither member of the committee has any personal financial interest (other than as a shareholder), conflicts of interests arising from 
cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. The committee makes recommendations to the Board. No 
director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
In determining the directors' remuneration for the year, the committee consulted the Chief Executive about its proposals. 
Remuneration policy for the executive directors
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the high calibre needed to 
maintain the Group's position and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The performance measurement of the 
executive directors and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the committee.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors:
 	 basic	annual	salar y;
 	 benefits	in	kind;
 	 annual	bonus	payments;	and
 	 pension	arrangements.
The Company's policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be performance related. 
Executive directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company provided that the Board's permission is first sought.
Basic salary
Executive directors' salaries are reviewed annually on 1 October with regard to levels of remuneration and performance relative to 
comparable companies within the department store/retail sector, growth in returns to shareholders through earnings per share and 
capital growth and the contribution of the individual director. In addition, the committee considers average staff pay increases and the 
conditions of employees when setting directors' remuneration.
Benefits in kind
The executive directors receive certain benefits in kind, private health insurance and discount on merchandise purchased in store. 
Tony Brown had a fully funded company car and Ken Owst received a car allowance throughout the year.

Bonus
The executive directors participate in an annual bonus scheme whereby Tony Brown can earn a bonus of up to 100% of his salary and 
Ken Owst can earn a bonus of up to 60% of his salary. This scheme is self-financing and is based primarily on achieving demanding 
profit targets; the scheme also provides for an element payable at the discretion of the remuneration committee. 
Both executive directors also participate in the Medium Term Bonus Scheme (MTBS) which runs for the three years ending  
31 October 2011. The amounts which accrue to the directors under the MTBS are equal to their annual bonuses from the above 
scheme. The medium term bonuses are only payable if the directors are in Beale PLC employment, are not working their notice period 
and have not tendered their resignation, when the bonus becomes payable in January 2012.
The relevant profit targets were not achieved in the year ended 30 October 2010 or the year ended 31 October 2009.

Pension arrangements
One executive director, Ken Owst, is a deferred member of the final salary section of the Group's occupational pension scheme, 
which is registered with HM Revenue & Customs. The final salary pension scheme was closed to further accrual on 30 April 2009. 
Bonus payments and benefits in kind were not pensionable.
The scheme provided for enhanced benefits for Ken Owst, namely a normal retirement age of 60, an accrual rate of 1/45 final salary 
for each year of service, life assurance cover, plus a spouse's pension following death in service, if applicable, and a spouse's pension 
after retirement. Ken Owst is entitled to a pension on early retirement due to ill health of 2/3 final salary. Spouses' pensions of one- 
half of directors' pensions are payable on death after retirement. In common with other members, pensions related to service prior to 
6 April 1997 are increased by 5% per annum and pensions related to subsequent service are increased in line with the Retail Prices 
Index (subject to a maximum of 5% per annum).

the Company contributed  1,333 (2009:  7,897) and  35,625 (2009:  40,312) respectively to their pensions in the financial year.

Service contracts and letters of appointment
The remuneration committee has considered it inappropriate to quantify damages payable in the event of service contracts being 
terminated. It concluded that this would only be beneficial if termination followed a change in control of the Company and, in such an 
event, up to twelve months' salary has been agreed as an appropriate estimate.

Non-executive directors
All non-executive directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set 
by the Articles of Association and based on independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors of similar companies. The 
basic fee paid to each non-executive director in the year is set out below. The non-executive directors do not receive additional fees 
in respect of their membership of the remuneration committee, nomination committee or audit committee. Non-executive directors 
cannot participate in any of the Company's future share option schemes and are not eligible to join the Company's pension scheme.
