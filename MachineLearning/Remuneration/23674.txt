Beale PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2011
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulation 2008. The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and 
describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to directors' remuneration. As required by the regulations, a resolution to 
approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The 2008 regulation requires the auditors to report to the Company's members on certain parts of the directors' remuneration report and 
to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the regulations. The report has 
therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.

Remuneration committee
The members of the committee were Keith Edelman and Mike Killingley, who were both independent non-executive directors; with Keith 
Edelman chairing the committee. On 8 November 2011 Mike Killingley resigned from the committee and William Tuffy was appointed 
chairman of the committee.
Neither member of the committee had any personal financial interest (other than as a shareholder), conflicts of interests arising from 
cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. The committee makes recommendations to the Board. No 
director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
Remuneration policy for the executive directors
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the high calibre needed to maintain 
the Group's position and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The performance measurement of the executive directors 
and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the committee.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors:
 	 basic annual salary;
 	 benefits in kind;
 	 annual bonus payments; and
 	 pension arrangements.
The Company's policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be performance related. 
Executive directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company provided that the Board's permission is first sought.
Basic salary
Executive directors' salaries are reviewed annually on 1 October with regard to levels of remuneration and performance relative to 
comparable companies within the department store/retail sector, growth in returns to shareholders through earnings per share and 
capital growth and the contribution of the individual director. In addition, the committee considers average staff pay increases and the 
conditions of employees when setting directors' remuneration.
Benefits in kind
The executive directors receive certain benefits in kind, private health insurance and discount on merchandise purchased in store. Tony 
Richards' subsistence expenses are paid for by the Company. Tony Brown and Tony Richards had a fully funded company car and Ken 
Owst received a car allowance throughout the year.
Performance Share Plan
The Performance Share Plan ( PSP'), which was approved by shareholders at the 2011 EGM, was introduced as the Company's primary 
long-term incentive plan. Under the PSP , awards are made to executive directors and selected other executives on the following basis:

The maximum award level is 150% of base salary per annum although awards up to 200% of base salary may be granted to an 
individual in exceptional circumstances (e.g. recruitment or retention). 
For the awards granted to the executive directors and senior executives this year; the performance condition that will determine the 
vesting of awards will be based on the absolute EPS  in 2013/14. EPS is the earnings per share of the company calculated on such 
basis as specified by the committee. The performance condition applying to the awards granted will allow 25 percent of an award to 
vest for EPS in the 2013/14 financial year of 4.25 pence, increasing pro-rata to 100 percent vesting of an award for EPS in the 2013/14 
financial year of 9.25 pence. For the purposes of comparison, EPS in the 2010/11 financial year of the Company was 2.93 pence.
Performance conditions were calculated by the remuneration committee. The committee may decide that executives benefit, in the 
form of additional cash or shares, from the value of dividends paid over the vesting period, to the extent that awards vest. It is currently 
intended that new issued shares are used to satisfy awards.
Bonus
The executive directors participate in an annual bonus scheme whereby Tony Brown can earn a bonus of up to 100% of his salary. Ken 
Owst and Tony Richards can earn a bonus of up to 60% of their salary. This scheme is self-financing and is based primarily on achieving 
demanding profit targets; the scheme also provides for an element payable at the discretion of the remuneration committee. 
All executive directors also participate in the Medium Term Bonus Scheme (MTBS) which ran for the three years ending 29 October 
2011. The amounts which accrue to the directors under the MTBS are equal to their annual bonuses from the above scheme. The 
medium term bonuses are only payable if the directors are in Beale PLC employment, are not working their notice period and have not 
tendered their resignation, when the bonus becomes payable in January 2012. Under this scheme no bonus was payable.
In the year ended 29 October 2011 following significant contributions from the executive directors in relation to the acquisition of 19 
department stores from ARCS, the remuneration committee awarded bonuses as set out in the directors' emoluments note below.
Audited information
Pension arrangements
One executive director, Ken Owst was a deferred member of the final salary section of the Group's occupational pension scheme, which 
is registered with HM Revenue and Customs. The final salary pension scheme was closed to further accrual on 30 April 2009. Bonus 
payments and benefits in kind were not pensionable.
The scheme provided for enhanced benefits for Ken Owst, namely a normal retirement age of 60, an accrual rate of 1/45 final salary 
for each year of service, life assurance cover, plus a spouse's pension following death in service, if applicable, and a spouse's pension 
after retirement. Ken Owst is entitled to a pension on early retirement due to ill health of 2/3 final salary. Spouses' pensions of one half 
of directors' pensions are payable on death after retirement. In common with other members, pensions related to service prior to 6 April 
1997 are increased by 5% per annum and pensions related to subsequent service are increased in line with the Retail Prices Index 
(subject to a maximum of 5% per annum).

Notes:
(a)  Since the defined benefit section of the scheme closed to future accrual on 30 April 2009, no contributions have been paid in the 
accounting period by the director.
(b) The absolute increase in accrued pension during the accounting period (net of inflation).
(c)  Accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement at 60, based on service to 30 April 2009 when the scheme 
closed to future accrual.
(d)  Ken Owst's  82,200 increase in the transfer value over the accounting period was primarily caused by a steep fall in gilt yields which 
occurred during the year.
(e)  The Company contributed  10,116 (2010:  10,000) to Ken Owst's personal pension scheme. Tony Brown is a member of the

his pension fund in the financial year.

Service contracts and letters of appointment
The remuneration committee has considered it inappropriate to quantify damages payable in the event of service contracts being 
terminated. It concluded that this would only be beneficial if termination followed a change in control of the Company and, in such an 
event, up to twelve months salary has been agreed as an appropriate estimate.

Non-executive directors
All non-executive directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set 
by the Articles of Association and based on independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors of similar companies. The 
basic fee paid to each non-executive director in the year is set out below. The non-executive directors do not receive additional fees in 
respect of their membership of the remuneration committee, nomination committee or audit committee. Non-executive directors cannot 
participate in any of the Company's future share option schemes and are not eligible to join the Company's pension scheme.
