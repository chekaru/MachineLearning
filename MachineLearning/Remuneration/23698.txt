The maximum award level is 150% of base salary per annum although awards up to 200% of base salary may be granted to an 
individual in exceptional circumstances (e.g. recruitment or retention). 
For the awards granted to the executive directors and senior executives last year; the performance condition that will determine the 
vesting of awards will be based on the absolute EPS  in 2013/14. EPS is the earnings per share of the Company calculated on such 
basis as specified by the committee. The performance condition applying to the awards granted will allow 25% of an award to vest for 
EPS in the 2013/14 financial year of 4.25 pence, increasing pro-rata to 100% vesting of an award for EPS in the 2013/14 financial year 
of 9.25 pence. For the purposes of comparison, EPS in the 2011/12 (28.3) pence (2011: 2.93 pence). The remuneration committee is 
of the opinion that the performance conditions will not be achieved.
Performance conditions were calculated by the remuneration committee. The committee may decide that executives benefit, in the 
form of additional cash or shares, from the value of dividends paid over the vesting period, to the extent that awards vest. It is currently 
intended that new issued shares are used to satisfy awards.
Bonus
The executive directors participate in an annual bonus scheme whereby Tony Brown can earn a bonus of up to 100% of his salary. Tony 
Richards can earn a bonus of up to 60% of his salary. This scheme is self-financing and is based primarily on achieving demanding profit 
targets; the scheme also provides for an element payable at the discretion of the remuneration committee. No bonus was payable during 
the year ended 3 November 2012.
In the year ended 29 October 2011 following significant contributions from the executive directors in relation to the acquisition of 
19 department stores from ARCS, the remuneration committee awarded bonuses of  224,000.
