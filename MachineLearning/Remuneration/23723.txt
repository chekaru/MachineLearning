 Report of the Remuneration Committee continued
Unaudited Information 
A Statement to the Shareholders from the Chairman of 
Remuneration Committee
I am pleased to report to shareholders on the aims, objectives and activities of the Remuneration Committee during 2012/2013. A 
resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 24 April 2014.
Please note the vote on the Remuneration Report will continue to be advisory. However, the vote on the future remuneration policy 
part of the report will be a binding vote.
As set out on page 34 the performance of the business continued to be loss making and consequently no financially linked 
bonuses are payable to directors, however, the directors achieved 83% of their specific objectives and consequently they received 
discretionary bonuses.
The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 have been approved 
by parliament which impact on companies listed on the main market in the UK. The revised disclosures have no impact on 
employees who are not directors.
The required disclosures in the Remuneration Report have changed quite substantially since the previous report, the main structure 
of the report is as follows:
  An annual statement from the chairman of the remuneration committee.
   An annual report on remuneration which includes details of what directors have been paid in the reporting period and some details 
of how policy will be implemented in the next financial period.
  A policy report which includes details of the remuneration policy.
The Group has been loss making since 2007 (2011 contained an exceptional profit) and consequently the business is in turnaround. 
In June 2012 the finance director resigned and in February 2013 the chief executive resigned. Michael Hitchcock was appointed 
CEO on 9 February 2013 because in the role of interim finance director he had demonstrated his skill and potential and was 
considered by the nomination committee as the outstanding candidate to lead the Beale PLC turnaround. Michael Hitchcock was 
appointed CEO on an appropriate remuneration package and Tony Richard's remuneration package was enhanced to reflect the 
added responsibilities of marketing, visual merchandising, loyalty card and subsequently operations. Whilst the business continues 
to turn itself around from continuing losses, it is important to set bonus objectives that are tied to the short term continuation of 
trade, the medium term stabilization of the business and the generation of long term strategies. The directors failed to achieve 
the financial targets set by the remuneration committee which would have entitled the directors to a profit target bonus. The 
remuneration committee believes that the remuneration packages are set at a level to retain the directors appointed to turn the 
business around.

Company contributed  10,000 (2012:  6,666). On 1 September 2013 Tony Richards joined the Company GPP and the 
Company contributed  2,333.
  During the year the Company contributed  27,243 to Michael Hitchcock's personal pension. The non-executive directors did 
not receive any pensionable entitlement. During 2013 no director was a member of the defined benefit scheme.
e)  Michael Hitchcock joined the Group in May 2012 and was appointed interim group finance director on 23 June 2012. Up until 
his appointment as chief executive on 9 February 2013 Michael Hitchcock was employed through Alium Partners Ltd at a cost 
of  124,200 (2012:  179,180). During this period he was not on the Board.
f)  The de minimis threshold for disclosure of payments to directors for loss of office of other payments paid in connection with 
qualifying services is  30,000.
g) The bonus scheme in place for the year ended 2 November 2013 operated on the following basis.
  Participation in the bonus scheme was non-contractual and could be withdrawn or amended at any time.
  Awards made under the bonus scheme would be waived in the event that the executive left the Company, had tendered his/her 
resignation or was working his/her notice period.
  All awards under the bonus scheme are subject to the deduction of PAYE & NI by the Company.
  It was intended that the Executive Directors participated in a bonus scheme whereby both could earn up to 100% of their 
salaries plus an additional  25,000 on achieving an EBITDA target.
   The scheme based in part (50% of base salaries) on the achievement of demanding profit targets; the scheme also provides for 
an element payable (50% of base salaries) at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
   The discretionary element, of up to 50% of base salary, was based on the achievements of specific objectives as agreed by the 
remuneration committee, to develop the strategic long term objectives of the Company. These clearly will not in the main relate 
to specific actions that enhance the annual profitability of the Company, but those that enhance long term shareholder value.

100% vesting of an award for EPS in the 2013/14 financial year of 9.25 pence. For the purposes of comparison, EPS in the 2012/13 
financial year of the Group was (18.9) pence (2012: (28.3) pence). For further details see note 26.

Base 
salary
   This is the core element of pay 
that reflects the individual's role 
and position within the Group 
and is payable for doing the 
expected day-to-day job.
   Ensuring we are competitive in 
the market allows us to attract, 
retain and motivate high-calibre 
employees with the skill sets 
to deliver our key aims whilst 
managing costs.
   Salaries are reviewed annually 
against:
 -  Level of skill, experience and 
scope of responsibilities, 
individual and business 
performance, economic climate 
and market conditions.
--------------------------------------- 
Non-executive salaries are 
reviewed in October of each year.
Whilst no absolute maximum has 
been set for the level of salary 
payable to Executive Directors, 
any increases in Executive 
Directors  salary will be ordinarily 
in line with the average increase 
(in percentage of salary terms) 
awarded to other employees in 
the Company. However, increases 
may be granted above this level 
in certain circumstances, such 
as where there is a change in the 
relevant Executive Director's role, 
responsibilities or experience or 
a significant increase in the size, 
value and/or complexity of the 
Group or to take account of the 
Executive Director's progression in 
the role.

Annual 
Incentive 
Plan
   To motivate directors and 
incentivise delivery of 
performance over the one-year 
operating cycle, focusing on 
the short to medium term 
elements of our strategic aims.
   Company and individual 
performance can be reflected 
through variable pay.
   Outstanding individual and 
Company performance is 
recognised and rewarded.
   Maximum and target bonus 
levels for Executive Directors 
are set by reference to practice 
at retail and general market 
comparators.
   The maximum bonus level 
potential under the AIP for the 
CEO and the Trading Director 
for achieving specific targets is 
50% of base salary. In addition 
the maximum bonus for 
achieving discretionary targets 
for the CEO and the Trading 
Director is 50% of base salary. 
Consequently the maximum 
bonus payable is 100% of base 
pay. In addition each executive 
director could earn  25,000 for 
achieving an EBITDA target.
   Performance over the financial 
year is measured against 
stretching financial and 
non-financial and individual 
performance targets set during 
the financial year.
   As bonus targets details are 
commercially sensitive these 
will only be reported on retro-
spectively.
   Bonus levels and the 
appropriateness of measures 
and weightings are reviewed 
annually to ensure they continue 
to support our strategy.
   Awards will be subject to a 
payment gateway such that the 
Committee must be satisfied 
that there are no material risk 
failings, reputational concerns 
or regulatory issues.
   Given the 
commercially 
sensitive nature of 
our performance

Payment for loss of 
office
   The notice period for executive 
directors is 1 year. 
   On loss of office the Company 
reserves the right to make a payment 
of basic salary in lieu of notice. This 
applies also to taxable benefits and 
pension contributions. For salary, 
pension contributions and taxable 
benefits the committee have the 
discretion to pay up to a full year 
entitlement. Bonus payments 
are pro-rated if the director was

   The Group is in turnaround. 
Consequently, pay and conditions 
of Group employees were not taken

Statement of 
shareholder views
   The only authoritative view of 
remuneration shareholders is their 
voting at the AGM. It is noted 
Panther Securities discouraged 
the granting of further shares via 
share schemes during the year. 
Consequently no more share awards 
were granted.
