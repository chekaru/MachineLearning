 Directors' Remuneration Report
THE BELHAVEN GROUP PLC    ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
PAGE   18
INTRODUCTION
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which introduced
new statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors' remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31
December 2002. The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority
and describes how the board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors' remuneration. As required
by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the company at
which the financial statements will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the company's members on the auditable part  of the Directors'
remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations). The report has therefore been divided into separate
sections for audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Group has established a Remuneration Committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the
Combined Code. The members of the Committee are Alistair Arkley, Chris Greig and Angus Meldrum who are all
independent non-executive directors and the Committee is chaired by Alistair Arkley. In addition Alistair Arkley was also a
member of the Committee during 2002 when the Committee was considering directors' remuneration for 2003.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interests arising from
cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. The Committee makes recommendations to the
board. No director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
In determining the directors' remuneration for the year, the Committee consulted Stuart Ross (Chief Executive) about its
proposals. 
REMUNERATION POLICY
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of a sufficiently high
calibre. The performance measurement of the executive directors and the determination of their annual remuneration
package are undertaken by the Committee. The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board as a
whole, having regard to the current market conditions.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors:
   Basic annual salary and benefits;
   Annual bonus payments which cannot exceed 50% of basic salary;
   Long term incentive plans;
   Share option incentives; and
   Pension arrangements.
The Group's policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be performance
related. As described below, executive directors may earn annual bonus payments of up to 50% of their basic salary
together with the benefits of participation in long term incentive plans and share option schemes.
Executive directors are not entitled to accept appointments outside the Group except where prior permission has been
granted by the Board.
BASIC SALARY
An executive director's basic salary is determined by the Committee prior to the beginning of each year and when an
individual changes position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers up-to-date information
on comparative companies. Basic salaries were reviewed in March 2002 with increases taking effect from 1 April 2002.
Directors also received an inflation-linked increase of 4% from 1 January 2003. They were again reviewed in March 2003
with increases taking effect from 1 April 2003. Executive directors contracts of service which include details of remuneration
will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
In addition to the basic salary, the executive directors receive certain benefits in-kind, principally a car and private medical
insurance.
ANNUAL BONUS PAYMENTS
The Committee establishes the objectives that must be met for each financial year if a performance related cash bonus is to
be paid. In setting appropriate bonus parameters the Committee considers the relevant divisional or corporate performance
objectives. The Committee believes that any incentive compensation awarded should be tied to the interest of the Group's
shareholders and that the principal measures of those interests is total profit growth for Stuart Ross and David Morrison and
divisional profit growth for Ian Herok, Jeff Myers and Bill Hughes. The maximum performance related bonus that can be
paid is 50% of the director's basic annual salary at the end of the year. Bonus payments for the year ended 30 March 2003
varied between 37% and 50%. This reflects the performance of the Group relative to divisional and corporate objectives set
by the Committee.
Payments made under the annual bonus scheme do not form part of pensionable earnings.

LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
On 13 July 2001, the Annual General Meeting of the Group approved the creation of a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
available to executive directors and senior executives.
The purpose of the LTIP is to retain the services of executive directors and senior executives and to reward their loyalty,
subject to tough performance targets being met in the Group as a whole, or in the division or subsidiary of the Group in
which the participant has an involvement.
Under the LTIP , individuals may be granted an award annually by the Group's Remuneration Committee, the vesting of
which will be subject to the attainment of pre-determined performance conditions measured over a three year period.
Awards are intended to deliver a pre-determined cash payment and a number of shares which will be fixed by reference to
the market price of the Group's shares at the date of the grant. The maximum value of the award as at the date of grant can
be no more than 100% of a participant's annual base salary at that date.
Payments made under the LTIP will not form part of pensionable earnings.
SHARE OPTIONS
The executive directors have options granted to them under the terms of the 1996 Approved and Unapproved Share Option
Schemes which are open to all qualifying employees. Under these schemes options are allocated to qualifying employees by
reference to the seniority of their positions within the Group. The exercise of options granted under these Schemes is
dependent upon a performance criterion which is discussed below. 
The Committee has responsibility for the grant of options under the terms of these schemes.
The performance criterion that must be met requires the Group's earnings per share to outperform the Retail Price Index by
at least 3% per annum over a period of three years from the date the option was granted. Thereafter the option may be
exercised during the rest of its life without further test. The performance criterion, which applies to all executive directors to
whom options have been granted under these schemes, was chosen to align the reward of the directors with the interest of
shareholders.
The exercise price of the options granted under the above schemes is equal to the market value of the Group's shares at the
time when the options are granted. The Group also operates a SAYE Share Option Scheme for qualifying employees under
which options may be granted at a discount of up to 20% of market value. The executive directors are eligible to participate
in the SAYE Share Option Scheme.
The Group's policy is to grant options to the directors at the discretion of the Committee taking into account individual
performance. No significant amendments are proposed to be made to the terms and conditions of any entitlement of a
director to share options.
PENSION ARRANGEMENTS
Executive directors are members of the Group pension scheme. Their spouses are eligible for spouses pensions and a lump
sum is payable in the event of death in service to named beneficiaries. The pension arrangements provide for a pension on
retirement of 
1
  60 basic annual salary per year of eligible service. No other payments to directors are pensionable.
In addition the Group contributes in respect of each of the executive directors a sum equal to 7.7% of the basic annual
salary, by equal monthly contributions, into Money Purchase Individual Executive Plans administered by an insurance
company.

DIRECTORS' CONTRACTS
It is the Group's policy that executive directors should have, where possible, contracts with an indefinite term providing for a
maximum of one year's notice. The service contract of Stuart Ross provides for a notice period of two years reflecting Stuart
Ross's importance to the Group. All other executive directors have contracts which are subject to one year's notice by either
party.
Bill Hughes, David Morrison and Jeff Myers who are proposed for re-election at the next annual general meeting have
service contracts which provide for a notice period of one year. 
The details of directors' contracts are summarised in the table below:
Date of Notice
NAME OF DIRECTOR contract Period
Stuart Ross 3 July 1996 Two years
David Morrison 3 July 1996 One year
Ian Herok 3 July 1996 One year
Jeff Myers 3 July 1996 One year
Bill Hughes 13 May 2003 One year
In the event of early termination, the executive directors' contracts provide for compensation up to a maximum of basic
salary and the gross value of all other contractual benefits for the notice period.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
All non-executive directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board having
regard to current market conditions and their anticipated time commitment. The fees paid to each non-executive director in
the year are disclosed in the table below. Non-executive directors cannot participate in any of the Group's share option
schemes and are not eligible to join the Group's pension scheme.
