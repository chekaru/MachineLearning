DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
INTRODUCTION 
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the Regulations). The report also meets the
relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the provisions of the
Combined Code relating to directors' remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the
Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company's members on the auditable part  of the report and to state whether in their opinion
that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations). The report has
therefore been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
The Group has established a Remuneration Committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code.
The members of the Committee are Alistair Arkley and Graeme Bissett who are both independent non-executive directors and the Committee is
chaired by Alistair Arkley. During the year, the Group Chairman, Angus Meldrum, resigned as a member of the Remuneration Committee to ensure
full compliance with the Combined Code, which requires that all Remuneration Committee members should be independent non-executive
directors. Terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on the Group's website.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the Company (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interests arising from cross-
directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board. No director plays a part in
any discussion about his own remuneration.
In determining the directors' remuneration for the year, the Committee consulted the Group Chairman and the Chief Executive about its proposals.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the remuneration of the directors and the divisional managing directors who are the
first layer of senior management below board level.
REMUNERATION POLICY 
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of a sufficiently high calibre.The performance
measurement of the executive directors and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Committee.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board as a whole, having regard to the current market conditions.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors:
 
Basic annual salary and benefits;
 
Annual bonuses;
 
Long term incentive plans; and
 
Pension arrangements.
The Group's policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be performance related. As described
below, executive directors may earn annual bonus payments together with the benefits of participation in long term incentive plans. Executive
directors are not entitled to accept appointments outside the Group except where prior permission has been granted by the Board.
The Group has not granted share option incentives to directors since 28 August 2002.
BASIC ANNUAL SALARY AND BENEFITS
An executive director's basic salary is determined by the Committee prior to the beginning of each financial year and when an individual changes
position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee from time to time considers up-to-date information on comparative
companies provided by independent third parties. Stuart Ross' basic salary was reviewed in March 2005 with a 4% increase taking effect from 
1 April 2005. Executive directors' contracts of service will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
In addition to the basic salary, the executive directors receive certain benefits in-kind, principally a car and private medical insurance. ANNUAL BONUSES
The Committee establishes the objectives that must be met for each financial year if a performance related cash bonus is to be paid. In setting
appropriate bonus parameters the Committee considers the relevant corporate performance objectives. The Committee believes that any incentive
awarded should be tied to the interest of the Company's shareholders and that the principal measure of those interests is total profit growth.
The maximum performance related bonus is ordinarily 50% of the director's basic annual salary but in light of the exceptional performance of the
Group, the Remuneration Committee used their discretion to remove this restriction for Stuart Ross in 2005 which resulted in an additional bonus
of  16,000. His total bonus for the year represented 58% of salary.
Payments made under the annual bonus scheme do not form part of pensionable earnings.
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLANS
On 13 July 2001, the Annual General Meeting of the Company approved the creation of a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) available to executive
directors and senior executives. The purpose of the LTIP is to retain the services of executive directors and senior executives and to reward their
loyalty, subject to tough performance targets being met in the Group as a whole, or in the division or subsidiary of the Group in which the
participant has an involvement.
Under the LTIP, individuals may be granted an award annually by the Remuneration Committee, the vesting of which will be subject to the
attainment of pre-determined performance conditions measured over a three year period. The cash element of the LTIP vests three years after the
date of the grant and the share element vests four years after the date of the grant. The performance conditions for executive directors in respect
of LTIPs already issued are Group earnings per share growth of more than RPI + 8% per annum compound and net asset value growth of more than
10% per annum compound. Awards are intended to deliver a pre-determined cash payment and a number of shares which will be fixed by reference
to the market price of the Company's shares at the date of the grant. The maximum value of the award as at the date of grant can be no more than
100% of a participant's annual base salary at that date.
Payments made under the LTIP do not form part of pensionable earnings. No LTIP share awards vested to executive directors during the year ended
3 April 2005. LTIP cash awards which vested in the year are set out in the details of directors' remuneration below.
PENSION ARRANGEMENTS 
Executive directors are members of the Group pension scheme. Their spouses are eligible for spouses pensions and a lump sum is payable in the
event of death in service to named beneficiaries. The pension arrangements provide for a pension on retirement of 1/60 basic annual salary per year
of eligible service, subject to HM Customs & Revenue rules. No other payments to directors are pensionable.
In addition, the Group contributes in respect of each of the executive directors a sum equal to 7.7% of the basic annual salary, by equal monthly
contributions, into Money Purchase Individual Executive Plans administered by an insurance company.
SHARE OPTIONS 
In addition to the four elements noted above, the executive directors have historically had options granted to them under the terms of the 1996
Approved and Unapproved Share Option Schemes which are open to all qualifying employees. Under these schemes options are allocated to
qualifying employees by reference to the seniority of their positions within the Group. The exercise of options granted under these schemes is
dependent upon a performance criterion which is discussed below.
The Committee has responsibility for the grant of options under the terms of these schemes.
The performance criterion which must be met requires the Group's earnings per share to outperform the Retail Price Index by at least 3% per
annum over a period of three years from the date the option was granted. Thereafter the option may be exercised during the rest of its life without
further test. The performance criterion, which applies to all executive directors to whom options have been granted under these schemes, was
chosen to align the reward of the directors with the interest of shareholders.
The exercise price of the options granted under the above schemes is equal to the market value of the Company's shares at the time when the
options are granted. The Group also operates a SAYE Share Option Scheme for qualifying employees under which options may be granted at a
discount of up to 20% of market value. The executive directors are eligible to participate in the SAYE Share Option Scheme.
The Group's policy is to grant options to the directors at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee taking into account individual
performance. No significant amendments are proposed to be made to the terms and conditions of any entitlement of a director to share options.
No share options were awarded to directors during the years ended 28 March 2004 and 3 April 2005.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH 
5 Year Return Index for The Belhaven Group plc as at 3 April 2005.
The graph shows the Company's performance, measured by total shareholder
return, compared with the performance of the FTSE small cap and the FTSE
leisure and hotels indices also measured by total shareholder return.
These indices have been selected for this comparison because the Board
considers them to be the most relevant available comparisons.
DIRECTORS' CONTRACTS 
It is the Group's policy that executive directors should have, where possible, contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of one
year's notice. Stuart Ross' contract of employment carries a period of notice of two years. The Board believes that it is desirable to maintain this
long-standing period of notice and does not consider the benefit of reducing this to one year justifies the cost to shareholders of achieving it.
The Chairman has contacted a cross-section of shareholders and they have agreed with our explanation. A future Chief Executive will have a one
year contract. Other executive directors have contracts which are subject to one year's notice by either party.
The details of directors' contracts are summarised in the table below:
Date of Notice
NAME OF DIRECTOR contract Period
Stuart Ross 3 July 1996 Two years
David Morrison 3 July 1996 One year
Ron Robson, who was appointed on 4 April 2005, has a contract with a notice period of one year.
In the event of early termination, the executive directors' contracts provide for compensation up to a maximum of basic salary and the gross value
of all other contractual benefits for the notice period.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
All non-executive directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board having regard to current market
conditions and their anticipated time commitment. The fees paid to each non-executive director in the year are disclosed in the table below.
Non-executive directors cannot participate in any of the Company's share option schemes and are not eligible to join the Group's pension scheme.
OTHER DIRECTORSHIPS OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Stuart Ross is the non-executive chairman of Montpeliers (Edinburgh) Limited but has no shareholding in that company. During 2005, he received a
fee of  12,500 all of which has been retained.
