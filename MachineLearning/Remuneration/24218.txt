Report of the Board on Directors' Remuneration

Annual Report & Accounts 2009 
Business Review Governance Accounts Other Information 
Introduction 
The remuneration of the executive directors is determined by the Board Committee on Executive Directors' Remuneration (the Committee ) within a 
framework set by the Board. As at the date of this report, the Committee's members are three non-executive directors, Mr Toms (Chairman), Mr Perry 
and Mr Johnson. Mr Perry is to retire at the AGM on 15 January 2010, and he will be replaced on this Committee by Mr John Cuthbert. None of the 
Committee members has a personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided. There are no conflicts of interest arising 
from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
During the year, the Group Company Secretary attended a number of Committee meetings at the invitation of the Committee and provided advice on 
issues other than those relating to his own remuneration. The Committee also received independent external advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street. 
Hewitt New Bridge Street was appointed by the Committee and does not provide any other services to the Company other than to the Board 
Committee on Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration. 
The remuneration of the non-executive directors (apart from the Chairman) is determined by the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors' 
Remuneration, which comprises the executive directors. The Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration also receives advice from 
the Group Company Secretary and Hewitt New Bridge Street. 
The Chairman's remuneration is determined by the other non-executive directors.  
Context 
This year's report is set in the context of the vote against the advisory resolution to approve the directors' remuneration report for 2007/08 at the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM ) in January 2009. The opposition of shareholders reflected concerns about the decision of the Committee to base the 
2007/08 annual bonus on a broad judgement of the performance of management in a volatile market, rather than to determine the bonus using a range 
of fixed operating profit targets, based around budget, as had been the case in previous years. It also reflected concerns that the Committee had failed to 
consult shareholders adequately in making this change. 
The Committee has been very mindful of these concerns, and undertook extensive consultations with institutional shareholders on future bonus 
arrangements in the spring of this year. As a result of these consultations it made significant changes to bonus arrangements including: 
 
reducing the maximum annual bonus payable from 120% (150% of salary in exceptional circumstances) to 100% of salary.  
 
for this year, further reducing maximum bonus potential to one-third of salary, to reflect the fact that the bonus terms were not established until  
March 2009. 
 
restructuring the bonus for this year from a payment based solely on operating profit, to a payment based on fixed targets for operating profit (before 
exceptional items) (40%) and cash generation (excluding any equity raising) (40%), with 20% based on personal performance, to be evaluated by the 
Committee after the year end, thereby providing a more rounded assessment of performance. 
The Committee also determined to freeze the salaries and certain benefits of executive directors for the 2009/10 financial year. 
Shareholders were consulted before these changes were implemented, and were supportive of the arrangements.  
The Committee considers these actions to be a measured and reasonable response to shareholders' concerns and hopes that they will be endorsed.  
The Company has also addressed the vesting of the award of shares granted in 2006 under the Bellway p.l.c. (2004) Performance Share Plan (PSP ). 
The award was based on relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR ) and the calculation as at 31 July 2009 confirmed that the TSR condition had  
been met. Before confirming the award, the Committee also considered the financial underpin which requires the Committee to satisfy itself that the 
Company's TSR reflects the Company's underlying financial performance. The underpin, which was approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2004,  
is defined in narrow and precise terms. The Committee considers that the terms of the underpin have been met and the awards will vest. 
The Committee has engaged with shareholders regarding certain matters in relation to the future operation of the PSP, including the wording of  
a financial underpin to apply to future awards and will give due consideration to these issues for the financial year commencing 1 August 2010.  36

Objectives 
The aim of the Committee is to ensure that the Company has competitive remuneration packages in place in order to recruit, retain and motivate 
executive directors in the overall interests of shareholders, the Company, its employees and its customers. The Committee has set, as an objective,  
a policy of paying remuneration around the median of a peer group of similar UK housebuilding businesses and it is satisfied that the structure of the 
executives' packages broadly achieves this objective. The Committee has used this comparative approach to benchmarking with caution, recognising  
the risk of upward only reviews of remuneration. The structure of the package has been designed to ensure that the performance-related elements of 
remuneration (annual bonus and long-term incentives) constitute a significant proportion of an executive's potential total remuneration package, but  
are only receivable if demanding and stretching performance targets are achieved. The Committee considers that the remuneration level and structure 
are fully competitive with the market, with a significant element of the package payable in the form of share-based incentives, subject to long-term 
performance conditions, including relative TSR performance against other UK housebuilders, thereby creating an alignment with the interests of 
shareholders. 
In framing the Company's remuneration policy for executive directors, the Committee has given full consideration to the best practice provisions in the 
Combined Code and the Association of British Insurers' (ABI ) guidance. 
Summary of remuneration policy 
The policy in relation to each component of executive remuneration is described below: 
Component Policy Performance period How achieved 
Salary To be market competitive n/a Salary levels set by reference to the mid-market level of a peer group 
of similar UK housebuilding businesses, taking account of individual 
performance and experience. In practice, notwithstanding the fact  
that the current management team is highly experienced and well 
regarded, packages are generally at or below the median. 
Benefits To provide a range and value 
which is market competitive 
n/a Benefits to be at the mid-market level of a peer group of similar UK 
housebuilding businesses which include a salary supplement in lieu of 
pension contributions, car or car allowance, life assurance, medical 
cover and permanent health insurance. 
Annual Bonus To reward achievement of annual 
operational-based performance 
targets 
1 year By providing the opportunity to earn a bonus of up to 100% of  
salary for outstanding operational performance, both financial and 
non-financial.  
Long-term incentives 
(performance shares  
and matching shares) 
To encourage long-term value 
creation, to aid retention, to 
encourage shareholding, and to 
promote alignment of interest 
with shareholders 
3 years By using share-based incentives with performance conditions which 
are aligned with shareholders' interests, such as TSR, which are 
assessed over a three-year period. 
Service contracts and letters of appointment 
The executive directors have fixed-term service contracts which specify that retirement is at age 60, with a 12-month notice period from the Company 
and a six-month notice period from the executive. On termination by the Company, an amount equivalent to one year's salary, benefits and the average 
amount of the last two years' annual bonus payments, would be payable. Within six months of a change of control, if the Company or the executive 
director serves notice to terminate the contract, the liquidated damages payment would be triggered.  
The inclusion of average annual bonus in the calculation of compensation payable for early termination will ensure that there is variability in the potential 
level of compensation. In particular, after a period of poor performance, it could be expected that little or no bonus would be payable, reducing potential 
payout in these circumstances.  
The service contracts of all executive directors have been reviewed and amended, including the removal of the right to indexation of basic salaries.  
The Committee has also proposed amendments to the terms of future contracts. These actions will make service contracts consistent with current best 
practice. The details of the executive directors' service contracts are as follows:

On the expiry of his existing letter of appointment, it is the intention of the Company to issue a new letter of appointment to Mr Johnson for a term of 
three years. Mr Cuthbert is to be appointed as a non-executive director with effect from 1 November 2009 and his letter of appointment will run from 
1 November 2009 to 31 October 2012. 
Salaries and fees 
Salaries are reviewed on 1 August each year, taking into account the general settlement across the Company. Any changes are implemented from  
that date. 
For the year under review, the executive directors were awarded a rise of 3% with effect from 1 August 2008. For the 2009/10 financial year salaries 
were frozen from 1 August 2009.  
Fee levels for non-executive directors reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of the role and are reviewed annually, taking into account the 
level of fees for similar positions in comparable companies. They are not entitled to any benefits (with the exception of the Chairman) or pension.  
They do not participate in any bonus or long-term incentive plan and they are not entitled to compensation on termination of their agreements, other 
than normal notice provisions of three months' notice given by either party.  
Benefits in kind 
Benefits in kind provided to the executive directors relate to the provision of motor vehicles and private medical insurance. 
Annual bonus scheme 
For several years the annual bonus scheme had a potential of 120% of basic salary (with 150% for exceptional performance). Following engagement  
with institutional shareholders, for the year under review the maximum was reduced to 100% of basic salary. Furthermore, in view of the fact that the 
performance conditions had not been determined until two-thirds of the 2008/09 financial year had elapsed, the maximum bonus potential was scaled 
back to one-third of basic salary. The performance conditions for the 2008/09 bonus were operating profit (before exceptional items) (40%), debt 
reduction (excluding any equity raising) (40%) and personal performance (20%). The latter to be assessed on the basis of how well management  
is perceived to have negotiated the Company through the present housing downturn during the year. Full details of the bonus payments and the 
performance conditions are set out in the notes to the table of directors' emoluments. Annual bonuses are not pensionable. 
The 2009/10 bonuses will also be capped at 100% of basic salary. The performance conditions will be operating profit (before exceptional items) (80%) 
and personal performance (20%), with personal performance being assessed by reference to succession planning, land bank management, health and 
safety and customer care. The greater weighting on operating profit (before exceptional items) at the expense of debt reduction in last year's bonus plan 
reflects the improved opportunities for growth this year. 
The bonus will be payable in cash, with executives having the opportunity to invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus in Bellway shares under the terms 
of the Bellway p.l.c. (2008) Share Matching Plan. 
Long-term incentive schemes 
The Company operates two long-term incentive plans, designed to focus executive directors on longer term value creation, provide a strong retentive 
element and provide alignment of interest with shareholders. 
The Bellway p.l.c. (2004) Performance Share Plan (the PSP ) was introduced for the Company's executive directors and the Group Company 
Secretary. Under the PSP, executives have been granted awards over shares worth 100% of basic salary each year, subject to the achievement of  
TSR-based performance conditions or, in January 2008, a combination of TSR and Return on Capital Employed (ROCE ) conditions.  
The policy for long-term incentives to be granted in the 2009/10 financial year, as was the case in prior years, will be for awards to be granted over 
shares worth 100% of basic salary. Awards will vest to executives after three years subject to the achievement of performance conditions based around 
TSR, which compares the stock market performance (share price movement and dividends paid) of different companies.  
A TSR performance condition will compare Bellway's TSR against that of an index created by the average TSR of the other UK housebuilders.  
Awards will start to vest at 25% if Bellway's TSR matches the performance of the index. Full vesting will occur if Bellway's TSR out-performs the  
index by an average of 7.5% per annum over three years. The Committee has carried out significant modelling, the results of which support the  
premise that 7.5% per annum outperformance is equivalent to average upper quartile  TSR performance of the housebuilders over the long term. 
Further, regardless of TSR performance, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the Committee considers that the Company's TSR  
over the performance period reflects underlying financial performance. 
The companies comprising the Index for the awards to be granted in the financial year commencing on 1 August 2009 are Barratt Developments PLC, 
The Berkeley Group plc, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc and Taylor Wimpey plc.  
TSR is recognised as enabling alignment with the interests of institutional shareholders through providing a reward mechanism for delivering superior 
stock market performance.  38

Bellway p.l.c.
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 
The Bellway p.l.c. (2008) Share Matching Plan (the SMP ) operates in conjunction with the annual bonus plan. Under the SMP senior executives may 
invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus, on a voluntary basis, in Bellway shares, which must be held for a minimum of three years. Invested shares will 
not be subject to a risk of forfeiture and executives will enjoy full beneficial ownership (including voting rights and dividends). 
In return for investing in shares, under the SMP, an award of matching shares is granted. The level of matching is on a gross basis to the net of tax bonus 
invested in shares. 
Matching shares will vest subject to the executive remaining employed, retention of the invested shares and also subject to a performance condition. 
No awards have been made to date. For any awards which may be made the performance condition will be the same as will apply to the award under 
the PSP in the same period. 
In addition to the two executive plans detailed above, the Bellway p.l.c. (2003) Savings Related Share Option Scheme (2003 SRSOS ) is available to all 
employees, including the executive directors.  
Shareholding guidelines 
There is a minimum shareholding requirement for the executive directors, equivalent to 100% of basic salary. As at 31 July 2009, and at the date of this 
report, all executive directors hold shares with an equivalent value well in excess of 100% of their basic salary. Any executive directors appointed in the 
future will be given an appropriate period of time to acquire the requisite shareholding. 
Directors' interests  
The directors' interests (including family interests and holdings in which the directors are interested only as trustees) in the ordinary share capital of the 
Company are set out below: 
 Fully paid ordinary 12.5p shares

There has been no change in the above interests between 31 July 2009 and the date of this report. 
In addition, Mr Dawe had a beneficial interest in 629,164 Bellway p.l.c. 9.5% cumulative redeemable preference shares 2014 of  1 each which are held  
in his Self Invested Personal Pension Plan (SIPP ) at 31 July 2009 and at the date of this report (1 August 2008 - 554,164). Mr Leitch had a beneficial 
interest in 50,000 Bellway p.l.c. 9.5% cumulative redeemable preference shares 2014 of  1 each, which he held at 31 July 2009 and at the date of this 
report (1 August 2008 - 50,000). 
Pensions 
As disclosed in last year's report, in July 2008 the executive directors took enhanced transfer values from the final salary section of the Bellway plc 1972 
Pension & Life Assurance Scheme, and therefore have no accrued pension entitlements. Since 1 June 2008 they have received a cash payment in lieu of 
pension contributions amounting to 30% of basic salary.  
The auditors are required to report on the information contained in the following part of this report.  39

Notes: 
1. Taxable benefits relate to the provision of motor vehicles and private medical insurance. 
2. The annual bonus is payable in November 2009 for performance during the year ended 31 July 2009. The performance conditions for the 2008/09 bonus are operating profit (before exceptional 
items) (40%), debt reduction (excluding any equity raising) (40%) and personal performance (20%). The latter has been assessed on the basis of how well management is perceived to have negotiated 
the Company through the present housing downturn during the year. In addition, the bonus potential was scaled back by two-thirds as these targets were not set until March 2009. The actual bonus 
payments against each of these metrics were determined on the following basis.:  
 
operating profit was  45.6 million, which was at the lower end of the target range. A bonus of 1.94% of salary was therefore achieved.  
 
debt reduction was  180.9 million and the Company finished the year with debt of  36.8 million. This was well above the maximum of the target range and a bonus of 13.33% of salary  
was achieved. 
 
in respect of personal performance the Committee considered that the management team had clearly identified its strategic priorities and had jointly responded effectively to market conditions by 
reducing the size of the business and exerting strict cost control. A bonus of 5% of salary was therefore awarded to each executive director. 
3. Executive directors receive a cash payment in lieu of pension contribution amounting to 30% of basic salary. 
4. Appointed 1 February 2009. 
5. Retired 16 January 2009. 
Directors' interests in deferred bonus plan 
The executive directors have a beneficial interest in certain shares held in the Bellway Employee Share Trust (1992) pursuant to the grant of deferred 
bonus entitlements under the terms of the Bellway p.l.c. 2003 Deferred Bonus Plan (a legacy plan). The number of shares held in the Trust in respect  
of each director is as follows:

Notes: 
1. Market value on award 950.50p (14.11.2005), performance period 1 August 2005 - 31 July 2008. 
2. Market value on award 1,344.00p (18.10.2006), performance period 1 August 2006 - 31 July 2009. 
3. Market value on award 744.50p (16.01.2008), performance period 1 August 2007 - 31 July 2010. 
4. Market value on award 575.50p (04.11.2008), performance period 1 August 2008 - 31 July 2011. 
5. Market value on 24 November 2008, which was the day the shares vested, was 513.00p. The awards vested at 100% of the full entitlement. Aggregate gross gains made by these directors on vesting 
of these awards under the PSP in the year were  507,840.17 (2008 -  620,886.34). 
6. The performance conditions for each award are summarised below: 
(a) For awards made on 14 November 2005 and 18 October 2006, vesting is conditional on the achievement of a TSR performance condition requiring Bellway's TSR to be at least at the median  
of a comparator group of other housebuilders (at which point 33% of the award vests). Full vesting requires Bellway's TSR to be at the upper quartile. The Comparator group comprises Barratt 
Developments PLC, The Berkeley Group plc, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc and Taylor Wimpey plc (plus Countryside Properties PLC, Crest Nicholson plc, McCarthy & 
Stone plc, Taylor Woodrow plc, Westbury plc and Wilson Bowden plc, all of whom have now delisted).  
(b) For awards made on 16 January 2008, two performance conditions applied to separate parts of the award: 
(i) 50% of the award is based on a TSR condition against other housebuilders but, instead of a ranking approach (comparing Bellway's TSR to that of each other company) an Index is created  
out of the TSR of the other housebuilders in the group. Bellway's TSR is compared to that of the Index. If Bellway's TSR matches that of the Index, 25% of the TSR part of the award vests 
(reduced from the previous vesting profile whereby 33% of the award vested at median). Full vesting is achieved for 7.5% per annum outperformance of the Index. The companies comprising 
the Index for the awards made on 16 January 2008 are Barratt Developments PLC, The Berkeley Group plc, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc and Taylor Wimpey plc.  
(ii) The remaining 50% of the award is based on a range of ROCE based targets requiring average annual ROCE of 15% per annum (at which point, 25% of the ROCE part of the award would 
vest) to 22% per annum for all of this part of the award to vest. Awards vest on a straight-line basis in between these two points. 
(c) For the award made on 4 November 2008 the TSR part of the award applied as the sole performance condition (compared to the same companies as for the award made on 16 January 2008).  
 Further, regardless of TSR performance, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the Committee considers that the Company's TSR over the performance period reflects underlying 
financial performance. 
7. The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 July 2009 was 735.00p and the range during the year was 400.50p to 780.00p. 
There has been no change in the above potential future beneficial interests between 31 July 2009 and the date of this report.

Statement of Directors' Responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts 
Bellway p.l.c.
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts 2009 and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs ) as adopted by the EU and applicable 
law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis. 
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state  
of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial 
statements, the directors are required to: 
 
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and 
 
state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company's transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors' Report, Directors' Remuneration Report and 
Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
 
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and 
 
the Directors' Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the issuer and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
