HOW REMUNERA TION FOR THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS IS DETERMINED
The remuneration of the executive directors is determined by the Board Committee on Executive Directors' Remuneration 
(the  Committee') within a framework set by the Board. As at the date of this report, the Committee's members are three non-executive 
directors, Mr T oms (Chairman), Mr Johnson and Mr Cuthbert. None of the Committee members has a personal financial interest, other 
than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided. There are no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day 
involvement in running the business. The T erms of Reference of the Committee are available on the Group's website www.bellway.co.uk. 
During the year, the Group Company Secretary provided advice on issues other than those relating to his own remuneration. 
The Committee also received independent external advice from New Bridge Street ( NBS'), a trading name of Aon plc. NBS was 
appointed by the Committee and does not provide any other services to the Company other than to the Board Committee on 
Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration.
The Chairman's remuneration is also determined by the Committee.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERA TION
The remuneration of the non-executive directors (apart from the Chairman) is determined by the Board Committee on 
Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration, which comprises the executive directors. The Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors' 
Remuneration also receives advice from the Group Company Secretary and NBS.
CONTEXT AND KEY POINTS
This report covers a year during which the Committee was busy with two primary activities, both of which were undertaken 
with the benefit of prior consultation with major investors, in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The first was the setting and review of base salaries and pension provision for the new generation of executive directors at Bellway, 
together with preparation for the further changes to take place in early 2013.
Last year we reported on our decision to set basic pay for the two new executive directors at levels significantly below those 
of their more experienced predecessors, but with a stated intention of raising these towards competitive market levels as they 
establish themselves in their roles. As described below, the Company's operating performance has progressed significantly since 
these appointments and the Committee has recognised the contribution made by the new directors. From 1 August 2012 
we implemented the first of a series of rises in basic pay which should in due course lead to pay levels which are competitive 
with other comparable housebuilders. The Board subsequently has decided to promote Mr Ayres to Chief Executive in February 
2013 and the Committee will follow the same policy by appointing him on a salary of  400,000, significantly below the level 
currently earned by Mr Watson, but with the express intention that he should progress towards full market levels, subject to 
experience and satisfactory performance. When Mr Watson moves to the Chairman's role the Committee intends to take the 
opportunity to rebase the Chairman's fee downward to  180,000. The Committee has also examined the policy for pension 
provision and has set the value of the Company contribution at 20% of salary for both new executive directors.
The second area of focus was the setting of annual bonus parameters. For 2012 the total bonus potential was set at 120% of 
basic salary, with 90% of the bonus potential accounted for by reference to an operating profit target. The Committee set the 
target at a level which would require a substantial increase in operating profit, and the performance delivered was at the higher 
end of the range and a payment of 89.2% has been earned. The additional 30% of the bonus potential was accounted for by 
non-financial measures, namely land bank management, health and safety and customer care, and a payment of 30% has 
been earned. Progress has been made in each of these areas and in the latter case, 93.8% of Bellway's customers would 
now recommend Bellway to a friend, with customer care being a very important issue for the Company.
Finally, during the year, the Committee also introduced clawback provisions for both the annual bonus and long-term incentive 
plans ( LTIPs') in line with best practice.
Looking forward to 2012/13, other than the proposed salary increases set out above, the Committee does not anticipate 
any further changes to the policy.
OBJECTIVES OF THE REMUNERA TION POLICY
The aim of the Committee is to ensure that the Company has competitive remuneration packages in place in order to recruit, 
retain and motivate executive directors in the overall interests of shareholders, the Company, its employees and its customers.
The Committee has set, as an objective, a policy of paying a level of remuneration at around the median of a peer group of similar UK 
housebuilding businesses, subject to experience and performance. The Committee has used this comparative approach to benchmarking 
with caution, recognising the risk of upward only reviews of remuneration and different sizes of comparator businesses. The structure 
of the package has been designed to ensure that the performance-related elements of remuneration (annual bonus and LTIPs) 
constitute a significant proportion of an executive's potential total remuneration package, but are only receivable if demanding and 
stretching performance targets are achieved. The Committee considers that the remuneration policy is fully competitive with the market, 
with a significant element of the package payable in the form of share-based incentives, subject to long-term performance conditions.

Remuneration Bellway p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2012

The structure of the performance conditions for annual bonus and long-term incentives has been designed to provide a strong link to 
the Company's performance, namely a focus on maximising profit in a sustainable fashion and generating superior shareholder returns. 
This approach generates strong alignment of interest between senior executives and shareholders.
In framing the Company's remuneration policy for executive directors, the Committee has given full consideration to the best practice 
provisions in the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Association of British Insurers' ( ABI') guidance. 
When determining the elements of remuneration for the executive directors, the Committee takes into consideration the pay and 
conditions of employees throughout the Group as a whole, paying particular attention to the levels of pay increase awarded to the 
workforce generally. All employees, including the executive directors, can join the Company's savings related share option arrangements. 
All employees have access to pension arrangements, most have access to life assurance benefits and a significant proportion of 
employees benefit from health insurance, a company car or car allowance. The Committee is apprised of any significant policy 
changes for the workforce generally.

SALARIES AND FEES
Salaries are reviewed on 1 August each year, taking into account the general settlement across the Company. Any changes are 
implemented from that date.
For the year under review, Mr Watson received a 3% increase in basic salary which reflected the average percentage increase across the 
workforce generally. For 2012/13, Mr Watson has been awarded a 3% increase in basic salary, which again reflects the average percentage 
increase across the workforce generally for the same period. 
Mr Ayres was promoted to the Board on 1 August 2011 and Mr Adey was promoted to the Board on 1 February 2012. Their 
commencing salaries were significantly below those of their predecessors and market benchmarks. As disclosed in last year's report 
and elsewhere in this report, the Committee's intention is that these will be progressively adjusted as they develop and adapt into 
their new roles, subject to performance. 
With effect from 1 August 2012, Mr Ayres' salary has been increased from  250,000 to  300,000 and will be increased to  400,000 on 
appointment to the role of Chief Executive in February 2013. With effect from 1 August 2012 Mr Adey's salary has been increased from 
 200,000 to  225,000. 
The Chairman's fee increased by 3%, which is in line with the average percentage increase across the workforce generally for the same 
period. 
Fee levels for non-executive directors reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of the role, including membership or chairmanship 
of Board Committees. Fees are reviewed annually, taking into account the level of fees for similar positions in comparable companies. 
For the year under review, fees were increased by 3% which is in line with the average percentage increase across the workforce 
generally. Following a review of non-executive director fees, with effect from 1 August 2012 the following fees are payable which 
represent an aggregate rise of just over 3%; Mr Johnson  58,500, Mr T oms  54,500 and Mr Cuthbert  51,500.
Non-executive directors are not entitled to any benefits (with the exception of the Chairman) or pension. They do not participate 
in any bonus or long-term incentive plan and they are not entitled to compensation on termination of their agreements, other than 
normal notice provisions of three months' notice given by either party.
ANNUAL BONUS SCHEME
For the 2012/13 financial year the bonus opportunity will be unchanged at 120% of basic salary. The performance conditions relate 
to a stretching target range of operating profit (90%) and personal performance (30%), with personal performance being assessed 
by reference to land bank management, health and safety and customer care. The Committee considers that performance in relation to 
targets based on annual profitability and personal non-financial metrics provide a good link to the long-term performance of the business. 
The focus on profitability is balanced by there being a meaningful weighting of the overall bonus on a number of core non-financi al KPIs 
which are considered to have a strong link to short and long-term shareholder returns.
The performance conditions for the annual bonus are balanced by complementary long-term performance conditions under the Bellway 
p.l.c. (2004) Performance Share Plan (the  PSP'), discussed below.
The bonus will be payable in cash, with executives having the opportunity to invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus in Bellway 
shares held in the Bellway Employee Share Trust (1992) (the  Trust') under the terms of the Bellway p.l.c. (2008) Share Matching Plan 
(the  SMP').
Details of the bonus payments are set out in the notes to the table of directors' emoluments on page 44. 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS
The Company operates two LTIPs which are designed to focus executive directors on longer term value creation, provide a strong 
retentive element and alignment of interest with shareholders.
The PSP was introduced for the Company's executive directors and the Group Company Secretary. Awards will vest to executives 
after three years, subject to the achievement of performance conditions based around TSR which measures the total return (share 
price growth and dividend) on a notional investment in Bellway shares, compared to the return on the same notional investment 
in shares in another company or index. TSR is recognised as generating an alignment of interest between executives and institutional 
shareholders by providing a reward mechanism for delivering superior stock market performance. TSR calculations are independently 
calculated for the Committee by the Company's brokers. 
For the awards made in 2011/12 the TSR condition was in two equal parts. Half the award was based on performance relative to the 
Housebuilders Index and half by reference to the FTSE 250 Index. During the year the views of major shareholders have been sought 
on alternative or additional performance measures but in the absence of any consensus and in view of the strong alignment provided by 
TSR, the Committee has determined that the same TSR measures will be used for the 2012/13 awards. The Committee will keep this 
issue under review for future years. Bellway p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2012
42
Regardless of TSR performance, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that there has 
been an improvement in underlying financial performance over the performance period, taking into account, inter alia, operating 
profit, operating margin, ROCE and Net Asset Value ( NAV'). The Committee will scale back the level of vesting indicated by the TSR 
performance condition (potentially to zero) in circumstances where there has not been an improvement. 
The SMP operates in conjunction with the annual bonus. Under the SMP senior executives may invest up to 25% of their net cash annual 
bonus, in Bellway shares, which must be held for a minimum of three years in the Trust. Invested shares will not be subject to a risk 
of forfeiture and executives will enjoy full beneficial ownership (including voting rights and dividends).
In return for investing in shares under the SMP, an award of matching shares of up to 2:1 is granted. The level of matching is on a gross 
basis to the net of tax bonus invested in shares.
Matching shares will vest subject to the executive remaining employed, retention of the invested shares and also subject to performance 
conditions. No awards have been made to date. For any awards which may be made, the performance conditions will be determined by 
the Committee at the time of grant. 
Clawback
T o improve the risk profile of the policy and in line with best practice, the Company has introduced a clawback mechanism for bonus 
and LTIP awards to allow the Company, in exceptional circumstances, to clawback some or all of the payments made under the variable 
components of an individual's remuneration.
PENSION PROVISION
Mr Watson receives a cash payment in lieu of pension contributions amounting to 30% of basic salary. 
Mr Ayres is a member of the Company's Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan ( GSIPP') and from 1 August 2011 the Company 
made a contribution of 16% of his basic salary to the GSIPP on his behalf. Mr Adey is also a member of the GSIPP and from his 
appointment to the Board on 1 February 2012 the Company made a contribution of 10% of his basic salary to the GSIPP on his behalf. 
The Committee has reviewed the level of pension provision and from 1 August 2012 the Company pension contribution on behalf 
of both Mr Ayres and Mr Adey has been increased to 20% of salary, which is a broadly mid market level of pension provision 
(as a percentage of salary). Any amount payable in excess of HMRC approved pension contribution limits will be paid as a cash amount.
SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES
There is a policy for a minimum shareholding requirement for the executive directors, equivalent to 100% of basic salary. As at 31 
July 2012, and at the date of this report, Mr Watson held shares with an equivalent value well in excess of 100% of his basic salary. 
In response to the appointment of new executive directors to the Board, the Committee has established the following mechanism 
to ensure that new executive directors acquire the requisite shareholding. Within a period of three months of appointment an 
executive director must acquire a minimum of 1,000 ordinary shares in the Company and must retain at least 50% of any shares 
awarded under the PSP or SMP, after allowance for paying tax, until the requisite number of shares has been accumulated. 
If personal circumstances make this difficult, the Committee would exercise discretion. 
SERVICE CONTRACTS AND LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT
The executive directors have service contracts with a 12 month notice period from the Company and a six month notice period from 
the executive. 
For Mr Watson, on termination by the Company, an amount equivalent to one year's salary, benefits and the average amount of the 
last two years' annual bonus payments, would be payable. Within six months of a change of control, if Mr Watson serves notice to 
terminate the contract, the liquidated damages payment would be triggered. The inclusion of average annual bonus in the calculation 
of compensation payable for early termination has ensured that there was variability in the potential level of compensation. In particular, 
after a period of poor performance, it could be expected that little or no bonus would be payable, reducing potential payout in these 
circumstances. Mr Watson has long service with the Company and the Committee has not considered it appropriate to re-negotiate 
his contract in relation to this provision. 
In accordance with best practice, the service contracts of Mr Ayres and Mr Adey do not provide for the inclusion of average bonus as 
part of the compensation arrangements in the event of early termination and contain no liquidated damages provision. Consequently, 
following Mr Watson stepping down as Chief Executive on 31 January 2013, all executive directors will have service contracts fully 
compliant with latest best practice provisions. 
If an executive director is not re-elected as a director of the Company by shareholders at an AGM then the Company may terminate 
the Executive's employment by giving him 12 months' notice or payment in lieu of notice.

Notes:
1.  The annual bonus is payable in November 2012 for performance during the year ended 31 July 2012. The performance conditions for the 2011/12 bonus were operating 
profit (pre-exceptional items) (90%) and personal non-financial performance (30%), with non-financial performance being assessed b y reference to land bank management, 
health and safety and customer care. The actual bonus payments against each of these metrics were determined on the following basis:
 -  operating profit was  114.6 million, with no exceptional items, an increase of 52% over the previous year and at the higher end of the target range. Operating profit 
of  114.6 million generated a payment of 89.2% of salary out of a maximum possible 90% of salary.
 -  in respect of the non-financial elements, the Committee took account of performance against each metric. The Group had achieved a further improvement in its 
customer care score from 91% to 93.8%, and reduced its rate of over three-day lost time accidents per 100,000 employees to 761.18 from 767.90 and had achieved 
its land bank target for the following financial year.  This outstanding performance generated a maximum payment of 30% in respect of the non-financial metrics.
2. Mr Adey was appointed on 1 February 2012. The bonus paid is by reference to his period of service as a director, and was based on his salary as a director.
3.  Mr Stoker retired from the Board on 31 July 2011 and Mr Leitch retired from the Board on 31 January 2012. They did not receive any payments for loss of office on their 
retirement from the Board. Mr Leitch earned a pro rata bonus for the period that he worked in the 2011/12 financial year.

5.  Market value on 20 January 2012, which was the day the shares in respect of Mr Watson and Mr Leitch vested, was 740.445p. The awards vested at 99.6% of the 
full entitlement. Aggregate gross gains made by the above directors on vesting of these awards under the PSP in the year were  1,088,918 (2011 -  368,002). 
6. The performance conditions for each award are summarised below:
 (a)  For the awards made on 4 November 2008, 29 October 2009 and 21 October 2010, the awards were based on a TSR condition comparing Bellway's TSR 
against an index of the TSR of other housebuilders ( the Housebuilders Index'). If Bellway's TSR matches that of the Housebuilders Index, 25% of the award vests. 
Full vesting would be achieved for 7.5% per annum outperformance of the Housebuilders Index. The companies comprising the Housebuilders Index are Barratt 
Developments PLC, The Berkeley Group plc, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc and T aylor Wimpey plc. 
 (b)  For the award made on 24 October 2011 the TSR performance condition was in two parts. Half was measured by reference to the Housebuilders Index as 
above, and the other half was measured by reference to the companies in the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts and financial services). Awards start 
to vest at 25% if Bellway's TSR matches the median of the companies in the group, increasing on a straight-line basis so that full vesting would be achieved if 
Bellway's TSR reaches the upper quartile. 
 (c)  For the awards made on 4 November 2008 and 29 October 2009, regardless of TSR performance, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the 
Committee is satisfied that the Company's TSR over the performance period is reflective of underlying financial performance. For t he awards made on 21 October 
2010 and 24 October 2011, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that there has been an improvement in underlying 
financial performance, taking into account, inter alia, operating profit, operating margin, ROCE and NAV.

relevant performance conditions and subject to the relevant financial underpin. In respect of the award granted on 21 October 2010, Mr Leitch may exercise up to

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts and the Group and parent company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fai r view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent 
company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company's 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors' Report, Directors' Remuneration 
Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Group's website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT OF THE DIRECTORS IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT 
AND ACCOUNTS
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
  the Directors' Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the issuer and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.
