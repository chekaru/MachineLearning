 REPORT OF THE BOARD ON DIRECTORS'  
 REMUNERATION
Annual statement 
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to take this opportunity to introduce the Report of the Board on Directors' Remuneration. In June 2013, 
The Department of Business, Innovation and Skills published regulations that change the way directors' remuneration will be 
reported and voted upon. The regulations do not take effect until next year's report; however the Board has decided to disclose, 
in advance, additional information which it believes will make this Report easier to understand, consistent, as far as possible, with 
the requirements of the new regulations, and more helpful to shareholders.
Remuneration policy
The Board Committee on Executive Directors' Remuneration (the  Committee') reviews executive remuneration arrangements 
to ensure they are effective in supporting the business strategy, are competitive and align the remuneration of the executives 
with the interests of shareholders.
Remuneration paid in 2012/13
The basic salaries of the executive directors in 2012/13 were determined in July 2012 and were set out in last year's report. 
The total remuneration earned was determined in large part by the bonuses awarded for performance. Pages 3 and 4 of 
the Annual Report highlights the progress made by the Company which moved forward strongly throughout the year with 
significant gains in sales, average selling price, margin, operating profit, dividend and NAV. Importantly the year concluded 
with a strong forward order book and a significant increase in plots available with detailed planning permission. Operating 
performance exceeded the expectations of the Board and investors at the start of the year.
This performance is reflected in the annual bonus earned by executive directors for the year under review. The increase 
in operating profit of 31.8% was at the top of the target range and there was an improvement in all the non-financial target 
measures (health and safety, customer care and land bank). As a result, the executive directors earned a full bonus of 120% 
of basic salary.
Neither of the executive directors were granted awards under the existing Bellway p.l.c. 2004 Performance Share Plan ( 2004 
PSP') in 2010. The performance conditions were not achieved, and all the awards granted to other participants on 21 October 
2010 under the 2004 PSP will lapse.
Implementation of the remuneration policy in 2013/14
For the current year, the Committee focused on two specific areas. The first was the review of basic salary increases for the 
executive directors and the second related to the introduction of a new long-term incentive arrangement to replace the existing 
incentive plan. The latter was undertaken with the benefit of consultation with major investors, in accordance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code.
As disclosed last year, when the Chief Executive and Finance Director were appointed to the Board, their salaries were 
positioned at levels significantly below those of their more experienced predecessors, but with a stated intention of raising 
these towards competitive market levels, subject to good performance and increased experience in their roles. Ted Ayres was 
promoted to Chief Executive in February 2013 on a salary of  400,000 per annum and Keith Adey's salary throughout the year 
was  225,000 per annum. These salaries are significantly below the levels at other comparable housebuilders and FTSE  
250 companies. Their predecessors had retired on salaries of  560,300 in 2013 and  354,000 in 2012 respectively.
During the year, the Committee considered its approach to increasing salaries to market competitive levels and believes that 
phasing the increases is appropriate. The Committee not only recognises the strong Company performance during the year but 
also the steps taken to position the Company well for the future, including an increased level of land buying, the opening of new 
divisions and changes to the management team. It therefore decided to award salary increases of 25% for Ted Ayres and 27% 
for Keith Adey, bringing their salaries to  500,000 per annum and  285,000 per annum respectively from 1 August 2013. These 
remain below market levels and subject to continued strong performance in their respective roles, the Committee envisages 
making a further increase next year to bring salaries up to market levels in each case. Before doing so the Committee will seek 
up-to-date independent advice on market levels of basic salary at other housebuilders and consider this in light of the relative 
size, complexity and performance of the comparator companies.
The second major item considered by the Committee related to a new long-term incentive plan, to replace the existing 2004 
PSP which reaches the end of its 10-year life in January 2014.
In determining an appropriate new long-term incentive for executives, the Committee has undertaken a full review of the 
Company's arrangements to ensure that this policy is appropriate, straightforward and reflects institutional investors' views 
and market practice.
Following this review, the Committee has concluded that the current policy for the annual bonus and performance share plan 
remains appropriate for the Company and has determined that the new Bellway p.l.c. (2013) Performance Share Plan ( 2013 PSP') 
should incorporate the current terms of the 2004 PSP , albeit ensuring that it incorporates the latest best practice. There will 
be a slight change in relation to the calculation of one of the Total Shareholder Return ( TSR') performance conditions, and these 
are described later in the Report. 40

 REPORT OF THE BOARD ON DIRECTORS'  
 REMUNERATION CONTINUED
A number of the shareholders who were consulted on the new 2013 PSP queried the need for the Company's current Share 
Matching Plan ('SMP'), which expires in 2018, to run alongside the PSP . The Committee believes that the plan has provided a 
useful vehicle for the new directors to start to build shareholdings in the Company, but in response to the points raised during 
the consultation, the Committee intends to discontinue the plan after the 2014 round of awards.
Other than the changes to base salaries and a new performance share plan, the Committee is not proposing any other changes 
to the remuneration policy for the 2013/14 financial year, which is set out on pages 41 to 46. During the year it will review 
the metrics for the non-financial elements of the annual bonus to ensure that they remain aligned to the business strategy. 
Conclusion
The Committee considers that there has been a robust link between performance delivered and payments to executives and 
that the remuneration policy will both support and motivate the executive directors whilst aligning their remuneration to the 
Company's strategic objectives and to achieving long-term growth for shareholders.
The Committee seeks to maintain a good relationship with investors and will consult with major shareholders, the Association 
of British Insurers ( ABI'), and key advisory bodies ahead of any significant future changes to the remuneration policy. The 
Board was pleased that the 2012 Report of the Board on Directors' Remuneration received a 99% vote in favour at the last 
AGM. Shareholders are invited to approve the 2013 Report of the Board on Directors' Remuneration which will be subject 
to an advisory vote at the AGM to be held on Friday 13 December 2013.

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
The Report of the Board on Directors' Remuneration has been prepared pursuant to, and in accordance with Schedule 8 of the 
Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and a resolution to approve this 
Report will be proposed at the AGM of the Company to be held on 13 December 2013.
The Board supports the focus on transparency in the new disclosure regulations for UK listed companies which are due to take 
effect from October 2013. The Company has, therefore, decided to structure the Report to incorporate, voluntarily, as many of 
the proposed features as practicable this year. Accordingly, this Report has two sections - the Directors' Remuneration Policy 
and the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
The section on Directors' Remuneration Policy, which will in future years (normally on a triennial basis) be subject to a binding 
shareholder vote, includes: 
 a description of the Group' s remuneration policy;
  a description of how the conditions of other employees and the views of shareholders are taken into account in the 
Committee' s deliberations about executive pay; 
 a future policy table which outlines the features of key elements of remuneration;
 the terms of executive directors' service contracts; 
  the Group' s policy on exit payments; and
 an outline of remuneration scenarios for executive directors at different performance levels.
The Annual Report on Remuneration details the remuneration of directors in respect of the financial year under review. 
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION POLICY
The remuneration of the executive directors and the Chairman is determined by the Committee within a framework set by the 
Board. As at the date of this Report, the Committee's members are the non-executive directors and Mike Toms is the Chairman. 
None of the Committee members has a personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided. 
There are no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
The Terms of Reference of the Committee are available on the Group's website www.bellway.co.uk. During the year, the Group 
Company Secretary provided advice on issues other than those relating to his own remuneration. The Committee also received 
independent external advice from New Bridge Street ( NBS'), a trading subsidiary of Aon plc. NBS was appointed by the 
Committee and does not provide any other services to the Company other than to the Board Committee on Non-Executive 
Directors' Remuneration. NBS is also a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and abides by its Code of Conduct. 
The Committee is satisfied that NBS is independent. The total fee paid to NBS for advice to the Committees during the year 
was  65,560.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors (apart from the Chairman) is determined by the Board Committee  
on Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration, which comprises the executive directors. It also receives advice from the Group 
Company Secretary and NBS. 
The remuneration policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
published in 2012 and the views of the Company's major shareholders. 
Objectives of remuneration policy
The aim of the Committee is to ensure that the Company has competitive remuneration packages in place in order to recruit, 
retain and motivate executive directors in the overall interests of shareholders, the Company, its employees and its customers.
The Committee has a policy of paying a level of remuneration at around the mid-market level of a peer group of similar UK 
housebuilding businesses, subject to experience and performance. The Committee uses this comparative approach to 
benchmarking with caution, recognising the relatively low number of direct housebuilding comparators, their differing size and 
the risk of an upward ratchet effect with any peer-based analysis. 
The structure of the package has been designed to ensure that the performance-related elements of remuneration (annual 
bonus and long-term incentives) constitute a significant proportion of an executive's potential total remuneration package, but 
are only receivable if stretching performance targets are achieved. There is both encouragement and an incentive for executives 
to build a significant shareholding.
The structure of the performance conditions for annual bonus and long-term incentives has been designed to provide a strong 
link to the Company's performance, namely a focus on maximising profit in a sustainable fashion and generating superior 
shareholder returns, thereby generating a strong alignment of interest between senior executives and shareholders. The 
components of the non-financial elements of the bonus have been in place in, substantially, their present form for three years 
and performance against the targets has now reached high levels. The Committee believes that it would be timely to review 
them during the current year with a view to introducing possible changes from 2014/15.
In framing the Company's remuneration policy for executive directors, the Committee has given full consideration to the best 
practice provisions in the UK Corporate Governance Code and ABI guidance.  42

 REPORT OF THE BOARD ON DIRECTORS'  
 REMUNERATION CONTINUED
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group 
While the Company does not consult directly with employees when drawing up the executive remuneration policy, 
in determining the elements of remuneration for the executive directors the Committee takes into consideration the pay 
and conditions of employees throughout the Group as a whole, paying particular attention to the levels of basic pay increase 
awarded to the workforce generally. Normally the salaries of the directors are increased in accordance with the pay increase 
awarded to the workforce and it is the intention of the Committee to revert to this practice when the executive directors' salaries 
have reached mid-market levels. All employees, including the executive directors, can join the Company's savings related share 
option arrangements, have life assurance benefits and a significant proportion of employees benefit from health insurance, 
a company car or car allowance. Following the introduction of auto-enrolment in October 2013, all employees now have access 
to pension arrangements. The Committee is apprised regularly of any significant policy changes for the workforce generally 
and management below Board level in particular.
Consideration of shareholder views 
The Committee takes into account the views of shareholders. When any significant changes are proposed to the remuneration 
policy, the Chairman of the Committee will consult with major shareholders in advance. During 2012/13 remuneration issues 
generally were discussed with shareholders as part of the consultation on management succession. Shareholders have also 
been consulted on the proposals for the new performance share plan described below.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last year's remuneration report are provided on page 53. 
Future policy table 
This section of the Report describes the key components of the remuneration arrangements for each element of remuneration 
for executive and non-executive directors:
Component and

Operation Maximum opportunity Framework to assess 
performance
Salary
To be market competitive and 
therefore assist in recruiting 
and retaining high quality 
executives. Reflects individual 
role and experience.
Salaries are reviewed in July each year and 
changes take effect from 1 August.
They are determined by reference to 
market levels of a peer group of similar UK 
housebuilding businesses, taking account of 
salaries at other companies of a similar size and 
by taking account of individual performance and 
experience. 
Where salaries of new executive directors 
are positioned below market levels, the 
Committee's policy is to progress these 
over time as experience is gained, subject 
to performance.
No prescribed maximum. 
Increases normally in line 
with the average for the 
workforce generally, unless 
due to promotion or role 
change.
Salaries for 2013/14 are set 
out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
The performance of the 
executives and the Company 
is kept under continuous review 
by the Board.
Annual bonus
To reward achievement with 
a combination of financial 
and non-financial operational 
based performance 
targets in accordance with 
Company KPIs.
Annual bonuses are payable in November 
following the year end, subject to the 
achievement of performance targets that were 
set at the start of the year.
Bonuses are payable in cash and executives 
have the opportunity to invest up to 25% of 
their net cash bonus in Bellway shares with 
the opportunity of receiving matching shares 
(see below). 
The Company operates a clawback mechanism 
which allows the Company, in exceptional 
circumstances, to clawback some or all of the 
payments made under the variable components 
of an individual's remuneration.
120% of basic 
salary maximum.
The bonus is based on a 
combination of financial and 
non-financial objectives, with 
financial performance accounting 
for a majority of the overall bonus 
opportunity. 
The Committee determines 
the choice of measure(s) and 
their weighting for each year 
to ensure alignment with the 
Board's priorities over the short 
to medium-term.
Where non-financial 
performance conditions are 
used, in the event that the 
financial performance criteria do 
not meet threshold performance, 
the Committee will not pay any 
bonus under the non-financial 
elements.

Operation Maximum opportunity Framework to assess 
performance
Long-term incentives 
(performance share plan 
( PSP') and matching share 
plan ( SMP'))
To encourage long-term 
value creation, aid retention, 
encourage shareholding and 
promote alignment of interests 
with shareholders.
The Company operates two types of long-term 
incentive plan for executive directors, a PSP and 
a SMP .
Annual awards of nil cost options or conditional 
awards will be made under the 2013 PSP to 
the executive directors, at the discretion of 
the Committee. Awards vest three years after 
grant, subject to the achievement of stretching 
performance targets.
Under the SMP , the executive directors may 
invest up to 25% of their net cash annual 
bonus in Bellway shares, which must be held 
for a minimum of three years. Invested shares 
are not subject to the risk of forfeiture and 
executives will have full beneficial ownership 
(including voting rights and dividends). In return 
for investing in shares, an award of matching 
shares of up to 2:1 is granted on a gross of tax 
basis. These matching shares vest after three 
years subject to the achievement of stretching 
performance conditions.
The Company operates a clawback mechanism 
which allows the Company, in exceptional 
circumstances, to clawback some or all of the 
payments made. 
Under the PSP , the normal 
award limit to executive 
directors is 100% of salary, 
with the maximum value 
per annum capped at 150% 
of salary in exceptional 
circumstances.
Under the SMP , matching 
shares of up to 2:1 equivalent 
to bonus investment on a 
gross of tax basis (maximum 
of 25% of net cash bonus). 
It is intended that no more 
awards will be made under 
this plan after the 2014 round 
of awards.
PSP awards and SMP awards are 
subject to stretching three-year 
targets.
The awards are subject to relative 
TSR conditions against relevant 
comparator companies
(1)
.
For future awards the Committee 
may choose a financial measure 
such as EPS, ROCE or NAV 
in conjunction with or as an 
alternative to TSR depending 
on the medium to long-term 
priorities of the Group at the 
time of grant.
If the Committee decides to 
introduce a financial measure, 
it will carry out prior consultation 
with major shareholders.
Further details of the 
performance metrics applying 
to the awards for 2013/14 are 
set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
Pension
To provide a structure 
and value that is market 
competitive.
Pension contributions into the Company's 
Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan 
and/or a salary supplement in lieu of pension 
contributions.
20% of salary. Not applicable.
Benefits
To provide a range and value 
that is market competitive. 
Comprises car or car allowance, life assurance 
and health insurance.
Not applicable. Not applicable.
Chairman and non-executive 
directors
To set appropriate fees in 
light of the time commitment, 
responsibilities, wider market 
and best practice.
The Chairman' s fee is approved by the Board 
on the recommendation of the Board Committee 
on Executive Directors' Remuneration. 
The remuneration of the non-executive directors 
is determined by the Board Committee on 
Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration, which 
comprises the executive directors. 
Fee levels are reviewed annually taking into 
account the time commitment and responsibilities 
of the roles including membership or chairmanship 
of Board Committees and the level of fees for 
similar positions in comparable companies.
Non-executive directors are not entitled to any 
benefits (with the exception of the Chairman 
who receives health and life assurance benefits) 
or pension. They do not participate in any bonus 
or long-term incentive plans (with the exception 
of the Chairman whose existing entitlement when 
he moved from the role of Chief Executive under 
the 2004 PSP will be maintained) and they are not 
entitled to compensation on termination of their 
arrangements, other than normal notice provisions 
of three months' given by either party .
Not applicable. The performance of the non-
executive directors is assessed 
by the Chairman. The senior 
independent non-executive 
director reviews the performance 
of the Chairman in conjunction 
with the directors.
Notes:
1.  The Committee believes that relative TSR is an appropriate long-term performance metric as it generates an alignment of interest between executives and 
institutional shareholders by providing a reward mechanism for delivering superior stock market performance. The TSR performance is independently 
calculated for the Committee by the Company's brokers.  44
 Bellway p.l.c. 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Approach to recruitment remuneration
In arriving at a total package and in considering quantum for each element of the package, the Committee will take into account 
the skills and experience of the candidate, the market rate for a candidate of that experience as well as the importance of 
securing the preferred candidate. 
Element General Policy Specifics
Salary At a level required to attract the most 
appropriate candidate.
Discretion to pay lower basic salary with incremental increases as 
new appointee becomes established in the role.
Pension and benefits In line with Company policies.
Bonus In line with existing schemes. Specific targets could be introduced for an individual within the 
maximum individual limits of the annual bonus plan applicable 
at the time. Pro-rating would be applied as appropriate for intra-
year joiners.
Long-term incentives 
(PSP and SMP)
In line with Company policies and maximum limits 
in the PSP/SMP rules.
An award may be made in the year of joining or, alternatively, the 
award can be delayed until the following year. Targets would be 
the same as for other directors and grant levels consistent within 
the permitted individual maximum under the rules of the plan.
Other share awards
(1)
The Committee may make an incentive award to 
replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an 
executive leaving a previous employer. 
Awards would, where possible, be consistent with the awards 
forfeited in terms of vesting periods, expected value and 
performance conditions.
Notes:
1.  The Committee may make use of the flexibility provided in the Listing Rules to make such awards if deemed appropriate and/or arrangements outside the 
Committee's usual recruitment policy if the circumstances so demand in terms of replacing forfeited variable pay, securing the preferred candidate, 
relocation expenses or for any other reason. Shareholder approval will be sought for any such arrangements as necessary. 
Service contracts and loss of office payment policy 
The executive directors have service contracts with a 12-month notice period from the Company and a 6-month notice period 
from the executive. 
The overriding principle for payments on loss of office will be to honour contractual remuneration entitlements. The Committee 
would determine, on an equitable basis, the appropriate treatment of performance-linked elements of the package, taking 
account of the circumstances, in accordance with the rules of each respective plan. Failure will not be rewarded.

ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
Implementation of remuneration policy in 2013/14
This section sets out how the Company has implemented the remuneration policy for the 2013/14 financial year.
Base salaries
As stated in the section on Directors' Remuneration Policy, on their promotions to Chief Executive and Finance Director, 
their salaries were positioned significantly lower than their predecessors and market levels at the time. As indicated in last 
year's report, the Committee has decided to move salaries towards market levels in stages. The Committee believes that the 
new executives have settled well into their roles. They have taken advantage of market conditions and government policy to 
increase sales reservations, average selling price, legal completions and operating margin. The land bank has been increased 
and actions have been taken to develop management below Board level. Both the Chief Executive and the Finance Director 
have established sound relationships with investors and other stakeholders. Recognising both the strong Group and personal 
performance demonstrated during the year, it is intended that their salaries are increased to market levels in two instalments. 
The second instalment on 1 August 2014 will be contingent upon continuing strong performance of both the business and the 
executive over the year and on a current and independent review of the salaries of the executives of other housebuilders. For 
2013/14, their salaries are as follows: 
 Chief Executive   500,000 p.a.
 Finance Director   285,000 p.a.
Annual bonus
For the 2013/14 financial year, the bonus opportunity will be 120% of basic salary. The performance conditions relate 
to a stretching target range of pre-exceptional operating profit (90%) and non-financial performance (30%), with non-financial 
performance being assessed by reference to land bank management (10%), health and safety (10%) and customer care (10%). 
The Committee considers that performance in relation to targets based on annual profitability and non-financial metrics provide 
a good link to the long-term performance of the business. The focus on profitability is balanced by there being a meaningful 
weighting of the overall bonus on a number of core non-financial performance measures which are considered to have a strong 
link to short and long-term shareholder returns.
The bonus will be payable in cash, with executives having the opportunity to invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus in Bellway 
shares under the SMP . The Committee encourages the executives to take the opportunity provided by this scheme to build up 
their own personal shareholdings.
Long-term incentive plans
The Company will make awards under the new 2013 PSP for which it is seeking shareholder approval at the AGM on  
13 December 2013. Performance shares with a face value of 100% of salary will be granted to the executive directors and Group 
Company Secretary. Grants at lower levels, in percentage of salary terms, will be made to other selected senior employees.
The executives will also have the opportunity to invest up to 25% of their 2012/13 net bonus for a period of three years in the 
SMP , for which they will receive a match of up to 2 times the level of investment on a gross of tax basis.
The 2013/14 PSP awards (and SMP awards to the extent they are made) will vest to executives after three years, subject to the 
achievement of performance conditions, based around TSR, which measures the total return (share price growth and dividend) 
on a notional investment in Bellway shares, compared to the return on the same notional investment in shares in a group of other 
companies or an index. 
The TSR condition will comprise two equal parts. Half the award will be based on performance relative to the Housebuilders' 
Index and half by reference to the FTSE 250 Index, excluding investment trusts and companies in the financial services sector.
The Housebuilders' Index will comprise The Berkeley Group plc, Taylor Wimpey plc, Barratt Developments PLC, Persimmon plc, 
Bovis Homes Group PLC, Redrow plc and Crest Nicholson Holdings plc.
Previously the TSR calculation has been based on the average TSR of the other housebuilders, with a requirement for Bellway's 
TSR to match this average (for 25% of an award to vest) rising to 100% vesting for Bellway's TSR outperforming the average TSR 
plus 7 .5% per annum.
Having reviewed the basis for TSR performance measurement the Committee is proposing to change from using the average 
TSR to using the median TSR as the reference point. This is because the median value is less influenced by the performance 
of extreme outliers of the Index and so represents a more robust and comparable benchmark.
The Committee has re-examined the 7 .5% hurdle for out performance to establish whether this remains appropriately stretching 
and is comfortable that, based on robust back-testing, this is broadly equivalent to upper quartile performance.
For the other half of the award, the TSR will be based on performance against the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index, excluding 
investment trusts and financial services companies, with a median to upper quartile vesting scale for between 25% and 100% of 
the award to vest.
Regardless of TSR performance, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that there 
has been an improvement in underlying financial performance over the performance period, taking into account, inter alia, 
operating profit, operating margin, ROCE and NAV. The Committee will scale back the level of vesting indicated by the TSR 
performance condition (potentially to zero) in circumstances where there has not been an improvement.  48

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Annual bonus for the year ended 31 July 2013
The annual bonus is payable in November 2013 for performance during the year ended 31 July 2013. The performance 
conditions for the 2012/13 bonus were operating profit (pre-exceptional items) (90%) and personal non-financial performance 
(30%), with non-financial performance being assessed by reference to land bank management, health and safety and customer 
care. Each of these elements accounts for a maximum bonus of 10% of salary. In the event, the Company achieved very 
substantial improvement in operating profit, above City expectations and improved its performance in relation to each of the 
non-financial measures. The actual bonus payment against operating profit was determined on the following basis:
Measure
Weighting  
(% of salary) Threshold Target
Maximum 
value Actual
Payout  
(% of maximum)
Payout  
(% of salary)
Operating profit 90%  125 million  135 million  150 million  151 million 100% 90%
The three non-financial metrics were not determined on a range of targets but related to specific individual performance targets 
for each. Details are set out in the table below:
Non-financial measure Objectives Score
Land bank Increase in the forward land bank of plots with detailed planning permission 
in the year to 31 July 2013 to ensure the Group's revenue aspirations are not 
frustrated by land shortages in future years.
Maximum - 10% of salary
The Group exceeded its land bank target for the following financial year.
Achieved - 10% of salary
Health and safety Improvement in performance by reference to the rate of over 3 day lost time 
accidents, taking account of the volume of activity.
Maximum - 10% of salary
The Group reduced its rate of over 3 day lost time accidents per 100,000 
employees to 664.75 from 761.18 in 2012.
Achieved - 10% of salary
Customer care Improvement in the Group's performance, taking account of the results of the 
Company's survey of buyers' satisfaction  Would you recommend a Bellway 
home?'
Maximum - 10% of salary
The Group achieved a further improvement in its customer care score to 94.8% 
from 93.8% in 2012.
Achieved - 10% of salary
All the targets were achieved and the full bonus was payable in relation to each element. If the targets had not been achieved 
then no bonus would have been payable. In the case of health and safety, no bonus is payable if a work related fatality occurs 
on site.  50

Notes:
1.   Market value on award 715.00p. The performance period was 1 August 2009 - 31 July 2012. This award lapsed during the year due to failure to achieve the 
performance conditions.
2.  Market value on award 549.50p. The performance period was 1 August 2010 - 31 July 2013. The performance conditions were not achieved and these awards 
will lapse in full on 20 October 2013.
3. Market value on award 700.50p. The performance period is 1 August 2011 - 31 July 2014.
4.  On 13 November 2012 an award of performance shares under the 2004 PSP was made to Ted Ayres and Keith Adey. The awards were in the form of nil cost 
options. The face value of awards granted were equal to 100% of their respective salaries which is in line with the Committee's current grant policy. Ted Ayres 
was granted an award over 30,960 shares with a face value, on grant, of  300,000 and Keith Adey's award was over 23,220 shares with a face value, on grant, 
of  225,000. The market value of a Bellway share on award was 976.50p, and the performance period is 1 August 2012 - 31 July 2015. The awards are subject 
to a TSR performance condition, which is in two parts. Half is measured by reference to Bellway's TSR against an index of the TSR of other housebuilders (the 
 Housebuilders' Index'). If Bellway's TSR matches that of the Housebuilders' Index, 25% of the award vests. Full vesting would be achieved for 7 .5% per 
annum outperformance of the Housebuilders' Index. The companies comprising the Housebuilders' Index are Barratt Developments PLC, The Berkeley 
Group plc, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc and Taylor Wimpey plc. The other half is measured by reference to the companies in the 
FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts and financial services). Awards start to vest at 25% if Bellway's TSR matches the median of the companies in the 
Index, increasing on a straight-line basis so that full vesting would be achieved if Bellway's TSR reaches the upper quartile. Furthermore, no part of either 
element of this award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that there has been an improvement in underlying financial performance, taking into 
account, inter alia, operating profit, operating margin, ROCE and NAV.
5.  The performance conditions for previous awards are summarised below:
  (a)  For the awards made on 29 October 2009 and 21 October 2010 the performance criteria were not achieved.
  (b)  For the award made on 24 October 2011 the TSR performance condition was in two parts. Half was measured by reference to the Housebuilders' Index as 
above, and the other half was measured by reference to the companies in the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts and financial services) as above. 
Awards start to vest at 25% if Bellway's TSR matches the median of the companies in the group, increasing on a straight-line basis so that full vesting would 
be achieved if Bellway's TSR reaches the upper quartile. 
    Regardless of TSR performance, no part of an award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that the Company's TSR over the performance period 
is reflective of underlying financial performance, taking into account, inter alia, operating profit, operating margin, ROCE and NAV.
6.  The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 July 2013 was 1,380.00p and the range during the year was 802.00p to 1,455.00p.
The executive directors have a potential beneficial interest in certain shares held in the Trust pursuant to the allocation of shares 
under the SMP . The number of shares allocated in the Trust (as Matching Shares) in respect of each director, along with the 
market price of the shares at the date of award, is shown below:

3. References to (b), (c) and (e) correspond with the summary of outstanding share options in note 19 on page 77 .
4.  The 1996 ESOS award exercisable from 17 November 2007 is subject to the achievement of either of the following objective performance conditions: (a) the 
growth in earnings per share of the Group in any three consecutive years will not be less than the growth in the Retail Price Index plus 6% over the same 
period; or (b) the growth in earnings per share of the Group in any three consecutive years exceeding the mean average growth in earnings per share in the 
same period of companies whose shares were formerly quoted in the  Building and Construction' sector but whose shares are now quoted in the  Household 
Goods' sector of the FTSE Actuaries Shares Indices. The 1996 ESOS and 2005 ESOS awards exercisable from 31 October 2008, are subject to a profit before 
tax ( PBT') performance target at the operating division of Bellway Homes Limited where Ted Ayres was a director at the time of the grant and during the 
three year performance period. Full vesting occurs where actual PBT reaches the forecast PBT, within a 10% range, in each of the three financial years of the 
performance period, with one-third vesting if the target is met in only one year and two-thirds vesting if the target is met in two of the three years. 
If the target was not reached in any of the three years then the total award would lapse. The performance conditions have been met in full.
Statement of directors' shareholdings and share interests 
There is a policy for a minimum shareholding requirement for the executive directors, equivalent to 100% of basic salary. Within a 
period of three months of appointment an executive director must acquire a minimum of 1,000 ordinary shares in the Company 
and must retain at least 50% of any shares awarded under the PSP or SMP , after allowance for paying tax, until the requisite 
number of shares has been accumulated. If personal circumstances make this difficult, the Committee would exercise discretion.
The directors' interests (including family interests) in the ordinary share capital of the Company are set out below:

 RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts and the Group and parent company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial 
statements on the same basis.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing 
each of the Group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and 
the parent company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud 
and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors' Report, Directors' 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Group's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
  the Directors' Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the issuer 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.
