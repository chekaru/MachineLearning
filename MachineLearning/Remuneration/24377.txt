 Directors' Remuneration Report (continued) 
Service contracts
The service contract of  B R Bailey is subject to two years' notice of termination by the Company and
one year's notice of termination by B R Bailey.
The service contract of  P A Russell is subject to two years' notice of termination by the Company and
six months' notice of termination by P A Russell.
The service contract of  S W North is subject to one year's notice of termination by the Company and
six months' notice of termination by S W North.
These notice periods, in excess of one year, were agreed in order to attract and retain high calibre
individuals.  All of the service contracts are rolling contracts.  In the event of early termination of a
director's service contract the Remuneration Committee would seek to reduce the compensation to
reflect the departing director's obligation to mitigate loss of earnings.
Total Shareholder Return
A new Schedule 7A to the Companies Act now requires the Company to publish in the Directors'
Remuneration Report a line graph which shows the total shareholder return on a holding of the
Company's shares against a holding of hypothetical shares measured by reference to a broad equity
index.  Total shareholder return is the measure of the returns that a company has provided for its
shareholders reflecting share price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends.  It is, therefore,
considered to be a good indicator of a company's overall performance.
The performance chart shown below illustrates the Company's total return over the past five years
compared to the performance of the Small Capital Index, which the Remuneration Committee believes
to be the most appropriate index to be used given the size of the Company.

Resolution 9
This resolution seeks authority from shareholders for the Company to purchase up to 1,173,710
ordinary shares, an aggregate nominal amount of  117,371, which is equivalent to approximately 10% of
the Company's issued ordinary share capital at 31 December 2003.  The authority will expire at the end
of next year's Annual General Meeting and the resolution specifies the maximum and minimum prices
at which the shares may be bought.  Other investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels and the
overall financial position of the Company will be taken into account before deciding upon this course of
action.  Any shares purchased in this way will be cancelled and the number of shares in issue will
accordingly be reduced.  The directors have no immediate intention of exercising the proposed authority
when it becomes effective, but believe that the ability of the Company to buy its own shares if, in the
directors' opinion, market prices do not reflect the Company's worth, will be in the best interests of the
Company and its shareholders.  The directors intend to exercise this power only if they believe the effect
of such purchases will increase earnings per ordinary share.
The authority will expire on whichever is the earlier of the conclusion of the next Annual General
Meeting or 7 November 2005.
