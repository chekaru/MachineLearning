 The Remuneration Committee is comprised exclusively of non-executive directors who are R M T eare
(Chairman of the Committee), A M Peacock and C M McDowell. 
The Company's Remuneration Committee (the Committee ) decides the remuneration policy that
applies to executive directors and the Group's other senior management. In determining that policy, it
has given full consideration to the principles of the Combined Code.
In setting the remuneration policy, the Committee considers the basic salary and benefits available to
executive directors of comparable companies both in size and within the housebuilding sector.  
The Remuneration Committee takes into account the need to attract and retain directors of an
appropriate calibre and the need to ensure the commitment of executive directors to the continued
success of the Company. No external consultants were used by the Committee in the year in advising
the Remuneration Committee on remuneration policy. 
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee will be available for inspection at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
These parts of the Directors' Remuneration Report are unaudited.
Remuneration of non-executive directors
The non-executive directors each receive a fee for their services which is approved by the Board,
following recommendation by the Chairman of the Company. The level of remuneration paid to non-
executive directors reflects the time commitment and responsibilities required by the role.
The non-executive directors do not receive any pension or other benefits from the Company, nor do
they participate in any of the bonus or incentive schemes or share option schemes.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts with the Company . They are appointed on the
basis of serving at least a period of one year.
Remuneration policy for all executive directors
The Group provides competitive remuneration packages in order to attract, retain and motivate
executives who are expected to meet high levels of performance. The structure of the remuneration
package has been designed to:
  ensure that the performance related elements of remuneration (annual bonus and long-term
incentives) constitute a significant proportion of an executive's performance criteria, which are
aligned to the interests of shareholders; and
  provide employment related benefits including the provision of a company car, life assurance,
medical insurance and pension.
Salaries and benefits
The Committee meets at least once a year in order to consider and set the annual salaries for executive
directors.

Share options
Throughout the year the Company has operated an Inland Revenue Approved Executive Share Option
Scheme and an Unapproved Executive Scheme. These arrangements, which were established in 1998,
were approved at the 1998 Annual General Meeting of the Company.
Following changes to the relevant legislation in 1996, the maximum value of shares over which options
may be granted under an Inland Revenue approved scheme to any one individual may not exceed
 30,000. The Unapproved Scheme will enable additional options to be granted to employees and
directors on an unapproved basis in excess of this limit. However, the Remuneration Committee has
imposed a limit on the grant of options under this scheme to any one individual. T aking into account
options granted to an individual in the previous ten years, under any option scheme of the Company,
options granted under the Unapproved Scheme to that individual may not exceed four times his
remuneration for the current or preceding financial year. 
Options granted under the Approved Scheme will normally be exercisable within the period of between
three to ten years after the date of grant and, for options granted under the Unapproved Scheme, within
three to seven years. In establishing the executive schemes, the Committee has decided to subject grants
made under the Approved and Unapproved Schemes to performance criteria, such that options may
only be exercised if, over a consecutive three year period, there has been a growth in the Company's basic
earnings per share in excess of the Retail Price Index plus 2.5% per annum. Options granted under the
Approved Scheme are not offered at a discount.
The Committee supports employee participation in the Company through employee share schemes and
believes that these schemes play a useful role in aligning the interests of employees and shareholders.
Annual and long term bonus scheme
The Company operates an annual and long term bonus scheme (the Bonus Scheme ) for the executive
directors, including B R Bailey , the Chairman of the Company . The Bonus Scheme runs for a fixed three
year period to 31 December 2008. It is linked to the amount by which the average annual growth in the
Company's basic earnings per share (EPS ) exceeds the Retail Price Index plus 3% per annum over the
three year period.  Basic earnings per share is believed to be an appropriate measure for growth given the
size and structure of the Company.   
The key elements of the Bonus Scheme are:
a) A discretionary annual bonus based upon the achievement of certain financial and operational
targets set by the Remuneration Committee. The amount of such bonus shall not exceed 20% of
the executive director's basic salary for the year;
b) An annual bonus based on the percentage increase in the Group's earnings per share. The
percentage bonus payable will be reduced by the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index for
the same period plus 3% and the resulting rate will be applied to 60% of the executive director's
basic salary for that accounting period.  The bonus so calculated shall be reduced by the amount
of any bonus awarded under a) above; and
c) The final bonus is paid at the end of the three year period and will be based upon the average
annual EPS growth factor for the period and applied to basic annual salary , less any annual bonuses
paid under the Bonus Scheme. Over the three year period, the maximum bonus payable to any
director shall not exceed three times the executive director's average basic salary for the three year
period.

Total shareholder return
Schedule 7A to the Companies Act requires the Company to publish in the Directors' Remuneration
Report a line graph which shows the total shareholder return on a holding of the Company's shares
against a holding of hypothetical shares measured by reference to a broad equity index.  T otal shareholder
return is the measure of the returns that a company has provided for its shareholders reflecting share
price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends. It is, therefore, considered to be a good
indicator of a company's overall performance.
The performance chart shown below illustrates the Company's total return over the past five years
compared to the performance of the Small Capital Index, which the Remuneration Committee believes
to be the most appropriate index to be used given the size of the Company.
