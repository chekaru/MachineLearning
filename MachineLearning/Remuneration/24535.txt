Report on directors' remuneration
From Per Utnegaard
On the recommendation of the 
remuneration committee I am pleased 
to present the directors' remuneration 
report for 2010. This report sets out the 
policy and disclosures on directors' 
remuneration as required by the 
Companies Act 2006 and schedule 8 of 
the Large and Medium sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008.
In addition to these requirements, the 
remuneration committee has followed 
the principles of good governance set 
out in the Combined Code and 
complied with the requirements of the 
Listing Rules. The tables and 
accompanying notes on pages 59 to 61 
have been subject to audit.
During 2010 the committee:
 - reviewed who should provide 
independent remuneration advice 
to the committee and appointed 
Kepler Associates as its independent 
remuneration advisor;
 - following completion of the 
company's 2010 strategy review, 
consulted with the company's major 
shareholders in respect of the 2011 
annual bonus targets for the 
executive directors and members of 
the executive board; and
 - assessed the extent to which the 2010 
annual bonus targets were achieved 
as against the various financial 
performance metrics as detailed 
on page 56.
This remuneration report is structured

A resolution will be put to shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting on 
28th April 2011 asking them to approve 
this report.
I would like to take this opportunity  
to confirm that following the Annual 
General Meeting and after six years  
in the role I will be stepping down as 
Chairman of the remuneration 
committee. David Lowden will be 
appointed in my place. I will however 
continue to serve as a member of the 
remuneration committee.

Responsible 
remuneration.
Encouraging and rewarding strong performance -  
it is important to the success of the company that the 
remuneration strategy encourages and rewards strong 
performance. We continue to ensure that remuneration  
and rewards are closely aligned with the company's  
strategy of creating long-term shareholder value. 55

Philip Rogerson and Ren  Schuster 
resigned from the committee on 
28th February 2010. Iain Ferguson, 
David Lowden and Andrew Wood 
were appointed to the committee on 
1st March 2010. No member or 
attendee was present when their own 
remuneration was considered. Each 
member's attendance at committee 
meetings held during the year is set  
out in the Corporate governance 
statement on page 46. 
Following a review of the provision of 
independent remuneration advice in 
2010, Kepler Associates (who provide 
no other services to the company) 
was appointed as the committee's 
independent remuneration advisor. 
Representatives from Kepler Associates 
will be in attendance at committee 
meetings unless requested otherwise. 
Alithos Limited provide advice on the 
total shareholder return calculations for 
assessing the performance conditions 
under the Performance Share Plan.
The committee believes that the current 
remuneration strategy remains 
appropriate and intends to continue 
with the remuneration policy set out 
below. The committee's remuneration 
strategy is to ensure that remuneration 
packages:
 - help to attract, retain and motivate;
 - are compatible with the company's 
strategic aims, objectives and risk 
factors;
 - are aligned to shareholders' interests;
 - are market competitive; and
 - can be applied consistently 
throughout the group.
The committee's terms of reference 
were reviewed and approved by the 
board in February 2011 and are available 
on the company's website  
(www.berendsen.com) or upon  
request from the Company Secretary.
Remuneration reporting
Remuneration policy
The committee's remuneration policy 
is to:
 - ensure that remuneration levels for 
the company's senior executives take 
into account their experience, the 
nature and complexity of their role, 
relevant comparative market data and 
any unforeseen factors that may arise 
from time to time;
 - provide an appropriate package of 
benefits that is balanced between:
   short and long-term incentives;
    fixed and variable pay with a 
significant proportion of the 
remuneration package (at least half 
at a target level of performance) 
weighted towards variable pay; and
 - reward and recognise stretching 
performance and appropriate 
risk-reward behaviours.
In 2011 the committee will undertake  
a comprehensive review of 
remuneration for the executive  
team and other senior management 
employees to ensure that remuneration 
systems are aligned with our strategic 
objectives and the current economic 
climate.

When reviewing and setting executive 
remuneration, the committee takes  
into account the pay and employment 
conditions of all employees of the 
company and group. Following his 
first year as Chief Executive and 
recognising a good financial performance, 
Peter Ventress has been awarded a 
salary increase of 3% for 2011 which is in 
line with the average increase (excluding 
promotional increases) awarded to 
members of the executive board 
(including the executive directors). 
The main components of remuneration for the executive directors in 2011 are as follows:
Element Purpose Performance period Operation
Salary To provide competitive fixed 
remuneration that reflects the 
value of the individual, their skills 
and experience, and performance.
Annually Benchmarked against an appropriate 
comparator group. Consideration given to the 
wider pay levels and salary increases across 
the group.
Annual bonus To incentivise the achievement  
of annual targets which support 
the short to medium term strategy 
of the Company.
One year Bonus payments, capped at 100% of salary, 
based on the achievement of challenging 
financial targets. A multiplier is then applied 
which may increase/decrease the bonus 
payment by up to 30%, dependent upon 
strategic objectives being met, 25% if a bonus 
is deferred for three years and paid in shares 
(under the Deferred Bonus Share Plan).
Performance Share Plan (PSP)/ 
Co-Investment Plan(CIP)
Incentivises achievement of 
superior returns for shareholders 
over a three-year period, aids 
retention and aligns the interests 
of executive directors with 
shareholders.
Three years A discretionary PSP award capped at 100% 
of salary. Vesting subject to challenging 
performance targets being met. In respect  
of the CIP, up to 35% of salary can be invested 
in shares annually which may be matched on  
a two for one basis subject to performance 
targets being met and continued employment.
Pension To provide competitive post-
retirement benefits.
Ongoing Participation in defined contribution  
pension arrangements. 56
Berendsen plc Formerly The Davis Service Group Plc Report and Accounts 2010
Report on directors' remuneration (continued)
The salary for the Finance Director has 
historically been positioned below the 
market median. Rather than a one-off 
increase, the committee has 
implemented increases over a number 
of years, subject to performance, in 
order to ensure his salary is closer to  
the median. The 6% increase for 2011 
represents the final stage of this 
process. Other than in exceptional 
circumstances or recognising 
outstanding performance, salary 
increases in the future will be in line  
with the general workforce. 
The average increase for other UK 
employees including laundry operatives 
and management was 2.53%. 
Pension and non-cash benefits
Peter Ventress and Kevin Quinn have 
personal pension arrangements to which 
the company makes contributions 
(respectively) equivalent to 25% and 
20% of salary, paid either to their 
personal pension arrangements or as a 
salary supplement. Additional benefits 
such as life assurance cover of four 
times salary, permanent health 
insurance of up to 75% of salary, medical 
insurance and a car (or car allowance) 
are also provided.
2010 Annual bonus
In 2010, the maximum annual bonus 
opportunity for executive directors  
was 100% of salary (60% for target 
performance) with payment dependent 
upon non-financial personal 
performance metrics as well as financial 
targets based upon: (a) adjusted 
earnings per share (EPS); (b) post-tax 
return on invested capital (ROIC); and 
(c) the generation of free cash flow 
weightings between (a), (b) and 
(c): 34%, 33%, 33%.
Above-target levels of performance 
were achieved in respect of EPS 
and free cash flow and for ROIC, target 
performance was achieved. Taking into 
account personal performance, 
bonuses of 84% and 82% of salary were 
therefore awarded to the Chief 
Executive and Finance Director.  
Further details of annual bonuses are 
set out in the table detailing directors' 
remuneration on page 59.
For executive directors in 2010, a 
quarter of any bonus earned was paid in 
the form of deferred shares (under the 
Deferred Bonus Share Plan) which vest 
after three years, normally subject to 
continued employment over that 
period. On vesting, executives will 
receive the benefit of any dividends 
paid over the deferral period in the form 
of share-based dividend equivalents.
2011 Annual bonus
The maximum annual bonus 
opportunity for executive directors in 
2011 will be increased to 130% of salary 
and will be determined by reference 
to demanding financial performance 
metrics and a performance multiplier. 
The financial metrics will be based on:  
(a) adjusted earnings per share (EPS);  
(b) post-tax return on invested capital 
(ROIC); and (c) the generation of free 
cash flow weightings between (a), (b) 
and (c): 50%, 25%, 25%. Items (b) and (c) 
will not vest unless (a) is achieved.
The greater emphasis on EPS as a 
performance metric is to make sure  
that the executive directors and senior 
management remain focused on driving 
and delivering profitable growth over 
the short to medium term.
In addition a new performance 
multiplier will be applied to annual 
bonuses earned based on the extent to 
which certain strategic-related targets 
are met. The targets are designed to 
support the medium to long-term 
strategy of the group. 
For example, targets for the Chief 
Executive include changing the 
organisation's structure in line with the 
recommendations of the 2010 strategy 
review and implementing a group 
capital efficiency programme with the 
objective of producing a significant 
reduction to the group capital employed.
The performance multiplier will range 
from 0.7 to 1.3 and will allow the 
committee to either increase the bonus 
payout (capped at 130% of salary) or 
reduce it, to the extent that the specific 
targets have (or have not) been achieved.
Before the performance multiplier  
is applied to bonuses, bonus levels 
would be the same as 2010, ie 60%  
of salary for on-target levels of 
performance rising to 100% for  
stretch levels of performance.
A quarter of any bonus earned will 
continue to be paid in the form of 
deferred shares (under the Deferred 
Bonus Share Plan) which vest after 
three years.
Long-term incentives
The company operates two long-term 
incentive plans - the Performance Share 
Plan (PSP) and the Co-Investment Plan 
(CIP). The combination of the annual 
bonus, the PSP and the CIP provides  
a balance between short-term cash 
reward and longer-term share-based 
reward.
Performance Share Plan
The PSP remains the primary long-term 
incentive for the executive directors and 
other senior executives. The committee 
has the ability to approve the grant of 
performance shares worth up to 100% 
of salary each year (with a 200% limit  
in exceptional circumstances such as in 
the case of recruitment or where there 
are acute retention needs).

PSP 2010 award
In 2010, both executive directors 
received an award equal to 100% of 
salary. Vesting of these awards is 
subject to two performance conditions 
which will operate independently of 
each other. Half of an award is based 
upon a performance condition related 
to adjusted EPS and the other half is 
based upon post-tax ROIC with each 
half vesting in accordance with the 
schedules set out below. The committee 
believes that the use of two financial 
metrics is more relevant to, and 
therefore more consistent with, the 
company's current strategic goals.
PSP performance conditions -  
2010 grant
EPS performance target 2012
Less than 47p 0% of award vests
47p 25% of award vests
53p 100% of award vests

and 10.5% Straight-line basis
The actual 2009 performance (being the year's 
performance before the date of grant) was 39.4p for 
adjusted EPS and 7.1% for ROIC (restated).
PSP 2011 award
In 2011, the committee intends to limit 
individual awards to executive directors 
to no more than 100% of salary. 
Awards will again be subject to 
performance conditions based on 
adjusted EPS and post-tax ROIC  
split 50:50 with each half vesting in 
accordance with the schedules set  
out below.
PSP performance conditions -  
2011 grant
EPS performance target 2013

53p 25% of award vests

10.5% 100% of award vests
Between 8.5%  
and 10.5% Straight-line basis
The actual 2010 performance (being the year's 
performance before the date of grant) was 41.7p for 
adjusted EPS and 7.4% for ROIC.
The committee regards the above 
targets to be challenging in the  
current economic environment and 
highly stretching at the top end of  
the target range. 
To the extent that PSP awards vest, 
participants will receive the benefit  
of any dividends paid over the vesting 
period in the form of share-based 
dividend equivalents.
Co-Investment Plan (CIP)
The CIP operates as follows: 
 - selected executives are able to invest 
into the CIP certain company shares 
that they are deemed to hold, worth 
up to a maximum of 35% of their 
salary per annum. These shares are 
called  investment shares'; 
 - in return for investment shares being 
invested into the CIP, the executive is 
then granted an award over company 
shares that matches the number of 
investment shares. Matching awards 
can be granted either as guaranteed 
matching awards (awards that are not 
subject to performance conditions) 
and/or as performance-related 
matching awards (awards that are 
subject to performance conditions); 
 - invested shares subject to 
performance conditions may be 
matched up to 3:2 (up to 52.5% of 
salary); invested shares not subject  
to performance conditions may be 
matched up to 1:2 (up to 17.5%  
of salary); 
 - taking both types of awards together, 
the maximum matching ratio can 
never exceed 2:1;
 - matching awards normally vest three 
years after the grant date to the 
extent that the performance 
conditions have been satisfied. 
Matching awards would then vest  
in the ratios shown in the table below 
(matching shares to investment 
shares); and
 - to the extent that matching awards 
vest, participants receive the benefit 
of any dividends paid over the vesting 
period in the form of share-based 
dividend equivalents.

Other share plans
Other senior executives are eligible to 
participate in the Executive Incentive 
Plan (EIP) which is a share-based 
incentive plan under which awards are 
granted subject to stretching three-year 
performance conditions based 
on financial measures relevant to the 
particular business function or division. 
It is envisaged that awards will be 
granted under the EIP in March 2011.  
All UK and Irish employees, including 
executive directors, are also eligible  
to participate in the company's 
Sharesave Plan.
Importance of share ownership
The committee recognises the 
importance and value of having 
executive directors and other senior 
employees working towards holding 
shares with a value equivalent to 100% 
of their annual salary. To achieve this 
senior management are not permitted 
to sell any vested shares under the  
PSP or the CIP (other than to satisfy  
tax liabilities) until these guidelines  
are satisfied.
Managing shareholder dilution
The table below sets out the available 
dilution capacity for the company's 
employee share plans based on the 
limits set out in the rules of those plans 
that relate to issuing new shares.
2010
Total issued share capital as at 
31st December 2010  
(including shares in treasury) 171.8m
ABI share limits  
(in any consecutive 10-year period):
10% for all share plans 2.7%
Headroom 7.3%
5% for executive plans 1.7%
Headroom 3.3%
Awards granted under the Sharesave 
Plan will be satisfied by the issue of new 
shares at the date of vesting, while 
awards granted under all other share-
based plans will be satisfied by shares 
held in treasury or by shares purchased 
in the market and held in the company's 
Employee Benefit Trust. As at 
31st December 2010, the Employee 
Benefit Trust held 1,965,938 shares.

On termination, the directors would 
receive basic salary and pension 
contributions in respect of their 
outstanding notice period. In determining 
compensation levels on termination, the 
committee would have regard to best 
practice and the individual's duty to 
mitigate their loss.
Under their service agreements, 
executive directors are allowed (subject 
to board approval) to hold one non-
executive post and retain the fee 
received from any such post.
The Chairman and 
non-executive directors
The Chairman's annual fee is set by the 
committee and is currently  140,000 
(2010:  115,000). The non-executive 
directors receive annual fees at a level 
approved by the entire board, currently 
set at  42,000 (2010:  40,000) and  
an additional  10,000 (2010:  10,000) 
if they chair either the audit or 
remuneration committee and an 
additional  5,000 (2010:  5,000) 
if appointed the Senior Independent 
Director. They are able to claim 
reimbursement of actual expenditure 
incurred in carrying out their duties. 
There is no entitlement to participate in 
the company's pension scheme, bonus 
scheme or share plans and no 
compensation is payable for early 
termination of their contracts or terms 
of office.
The Chairman has been appointed for 
a fixed term of three years to January 
2014, terminable at three months' notice 
by either party, the terms of office of 
non-executive directors are for periods 
not exceeding three years which can be 
terminated by either party giving one 
month's notice. These terms of office 
are subject to shareholder approval 
when non-executive directors seek 
re-election at annual general meetings.
Total shareholder return
The committee believes that, due to the 
size of the company, the FTSE Mid 250 
Index (excluding Investment Trusts) 
is the most appropriate index against 
which to compare the historic TSR of 
the company. The chart below shows 
the TSR of the company compared with 
the index over the five-year period to 
31st December 2010.

Notes
(i)  During 2010 above-target levels of performance were achieved in respect of EPS and free cash flow and for ROIC target performance was achieved. Taking into account 
personal performance, bonuses of 84% and 82% were awarded to Peter Ventress and Kevin Quinn respectively. The non-financial (personal) performance metrics 
recognise the executive directors' contribution to the design and formulation of the company's strategic review. 25% of the total 2010 bonus will be deferred for three 
years into shares.
(ii)  Peter Ventress joined the company on 1st November 2009 and took up the appointment of Chief Executive on 1st January 2010. Between 1st November and 
31st December 2009 he received a salary of  42,000 and benefits of  2,913. In addition, he received a  200,000 one-off non-pensionable cash award in March 2010.

Notes
(i) The closing mid-market price of the ordinary shares at 31st December 2010 was 436.60 pence and during the year ranged from 360.20 pence to 441.30 pence. 
(ii)  Awards granted to executive directors in March 2010 were subject to a mixture of EPS and post-tax ROIC performance targets. The EPS target (applying to half of the 
awards) requires EPS of 47 pence in 2012 for 25% to vest rising to full vesting for EPS of 53 pence or higher. The ROIC target (applying to the other half of awards) 
requires ROIC of 7.5% over the period 2010-2012 for 25% to vest rising to full vesting for average ROIC of 10.5% or higher.
(iii)  All awards granted on or before 6th March 2008 under the PSP are subject to satisfaction of a performance condition whereby the company's TSR is compared with  
the TSR of the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding Investment Trusts) over a three-year period. Awards will vest fully for upper quartile performance reducing 
on a sliding scale to 25% vesting for median performance. No awards will vest for below median performance. Additionally, to ensure that the underlying financial 
performance of the company is also sound, awards will only vest if the growth in the company's EPS matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index over the 
corresponding three-year period. The award granted on 5th March 2007, vested on 4th March 2010 and the performance conditions were satisfied at 64.1%. This 
equates to awards of 28,451 shares vesting for Kevin Quinn (including dividend equivalents of 3,649). The share price at the date of vesting was 407 pence. 
(iv) Current indications are that the PSP awarded on 6th March 2008 will lapse as the Group TSR performance over the period was below median.
(v)  Awards granted to executive directors in March 2009 were subject to a mixture of EPS and post-tax ROIC performance targets. The EPS target (applying to half of the 
awards) requires EPS of 43 pence in 2011 for 25% to vest rising to full vesting for EPS of 47 pence or higher. The ROIC target (applying to the other half of awards) 
requires ROIC of 7% over the period 2009-2011 for 25% to vest rising to full vesting for average ROIC of 10% or higher.
(vi)  These share awards were granted in respect of performance and will vest after two years (2010 grant, three years) subject normally to continued employment. On 4th 
March 2010, 6,557 shares (including 677 dividend equivalents) vested. The share price at the date of vesting was 407 pence.
(vii)  The share award was not subject to any performance conditions as it was compensating Peter Ventress for the loss of non-performance related share-based awards 
granted to him by his previous employer.
(viii)  Further details of the Co-Investment Plan and performance conditions are detailed on page 57. The marching awards granted to executive directors in March 2010 were 
subject to a mixture of EPS and post-tax ROIC performance targets. The EPS target (applying to half of the awards) requires EPS of 47 pence in 2012 for 25% to vest 
rising to full vesting for EPS of 53 pence or higher. The ROIC target (applying to the other half of awards) requires ROIC of 7.5% over the period 2010-2012 for 25% to vest 
rising to full vesting for average ROIC of 10.5% or higher. 61
