Report on directors' remuneration
From David Lowden
I am pleased to present the report 
on directors' remuneration for 2011. 
In determining remuneration levels 
and strategy the committee pays 
close attention to the performance 
of the company, its strategic direction 
and external market conditions as 
well as following the principles of 
good corporate governance as 
set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
In 2011 the committee undertook a 
comprehensive review of short- and 
long-term incentive arrangements for 
the executive team and other senior 
managers. The focus was to ensure 
that the incentive arrangements 
remain aligned with the company's 
strategic direction.
The conclusions of the review were 
that the long-term arrangements are 
broadly fit for purpose but that annual 
bonuses could be more closely aligned 
to the successful execution of the 
company's strategic plan. Accordingly, 
during 2011, the main business of the 
committee was to:
k  consult with the company's major 
shareholders in respect of the 2012 
annual bonus measures for the 
executive directors and members 
of the executive board;
k  approve the implementation of 
a new reward strategy for below 
board senior management based 
on both group and business line 
performance measures and targets.
This remuneration report is structured 
as follows:

David Lowden
Chairman of the remuneration committee
23rd February 2012
Achieving our strategic and business objectives and 
to continue to build upon the company's strong market 
position, requires a remuneration strategy that is effective 
at recognising and rewarding employee performance at 
all levels and over different timeframes. We believe this 
approach creates, sustains and drives shareholder value 
over the short, medium and the long term.

Following Per Utnegaard's resignation 
as chairman of the remuneration 
committee on 28th April 2011, David 
Lowden became chairman. No member 
or attendee was present when their own 
remuneration was considered. Each 
member's attendance at committee 
meetings held during the year is set out 
in the Corporate governance statement 
on page 52.
Kepler Associates (who provide no 
other services to the company) are the 
committee's independent remuneration 
adviser. Representatives from Kepler 
Associates attended committee 
meetings during 2011. Alithos Limited 
provided advice on the total shareholder 
return calculations for assessing the 
performance conditions under the 
Performance Share Plan.
The committee believes that the 
current remuneration strategy 
remains appropriate and intends 
to continue with the remuneration 
policy set out below. The committee's 
remuneration strategy is to ensure 
that remuneration packages:
k  help to attract, retain and motivate;
k  reinforce the company's strategic 
aims and objectives, while mitigating 
any risk factors;
k  are aligned to shareholders' interests;
k  are market competitive; and
k  can be applied consistently 
throughout the group.
The committee's terms of reference 
were reviewed and approved by 
the board in February 2011 and are 
available on the company's website 
(www.berendsen.com) or upon request 
from the Company Secretary.
Remuneration reporting
Remuneration policy
The committee's remuneration policy is to:
k  ensure that remuneration levels for 
the company's senior executives take 
into account their experience, the 
nature and complexity of their role, 
relevant comparative market data and 
any unforeseen factors that may arise 
from time to time;
k  provide an appropriate package of 
benefits that is balanced between: 
- short- and long-term incentives; 
-  fixed and variable pay, with a 
significant proportion of the 
remuneration package (at least half 
at a target level of performance) 
weighted towards variable pay;
k  recognise and reward stretching 
performance and appropriate 
risk-reward behaviours.

Report on directors' remuneration (continued) 63
Berendsen plc Report and Accounts 2011
Overview Strategy and performance Business line review Risk Corporate responsibility Governance Financial statements Investors
When reviewing and setting executive 
remuneration, the committee takes 
into account the pay and employment 
conditions of all employees of the 
company and group. The executive 
directors have been awarded increases 
of 2.5% in 2012 reflecting the excellent 
progress made in 2011. The average 
increase for other UK employees 
including laundry operatives and 
management was 2.67%.
Annual bonuses
The maximum annual bonus opportunity 
(core award plus performance multiplier) 
for executive directors in 2012 will 
remain at 130% of salary and will 
be determined by reference to 
demanding financial performance 
metrics. The financial metrics will be 
based upon: (a) adjusted earnings per 
share (EPS); (b) the generation of 
free cash flow (FCF); and (c) revenue 
growth. Bonus payments will only be 
made provided that the EPS targets 
have first been achieved.
As can be seen from the table below 
(Annual bonus opportunity), for 2012, 
pre-tax return on invested capital 
(ROIC) has been substituted for sales 
growth. The committee feels that this 
change provides better alignment with 
our strategic objectives of improving 
our sales processes and growing 
revenue at 1-2% p.a. above GDP growth. 
While ROIC will continue to be used as 
a key performance metric for long-term 
incentives, it will be dropped from the 
annual bonus, as the planned measures 
to improve ROIC will necessarily take 
longer than a single year. The company's 
major shareholders were consulted prior 
to this substitution.
The performance multiplier operates 
to support the medium to long-term 
strategy of the group by allowing 
the core award to be increased or 
decreased by 30% in either direction, 
depending on the extent to which

challenging personal performance 
objectives are met. These objectives are 
specific to each executive. For example, 
the Chief Executive Officer's objectives 
include overseeing timely delivery 
of internal initiatives and driving 
talent management and diversity 
programmes throughout the business.
The target bonus opportunity will remain 
unchanged from 2011, at 60% of salary. 
The committee also sets threshold levels 
of performance for each of the financial 
performance measures. No bonus is 
paid under a measure unless threshold 
is achieved, and for performance at 
threshold the payout is one-third of 
target. If the EPS threshold is not 
achieved then no bonus will be paid, 
regardless of the achievement of the 
other measures.
The table below (Achievement of 
annual bonus targets in 2011) sets out 
the annual bonuses awarded to the 
Chief Executive Officer and the 
Finance Director.
For executive directors in 2011, 25% 
of any bonus earned was paid in the 
form of deferred shares under the 
company's Deferred Bonus Share Plan, 
which vest after three years subject 
to continued employment over that 
period. On vesting, executives will 
receive the benefit of any dividends 
paid over the deferral period in the form 
of share-based dividend equivalents.
Long  term incentives
The company operates two long-term 
incentive plans - the Performance Share 
Plan (PSP) and the Co-Investment 
Plan (CIP). The combination of the 
annual bonus, the PSP and the CIP 
provides a balance between short-term 
cash rewards and longer term 
share-based rewards.
The CIP was approved by shareholders 
in 2009 and first operated in 2010. 
Its purpose was to encourage the 
executive team to work towards holding 
a significant investment in Berendsen 
shares thereby ensuring even closer 
alignment with shareholders. Since it was 
first operated, the executive board and 
senior management have significantly 
increased their shareholdings in the 
group. This year (being the third year of 
operation) the committee has decided 
to review the ongoing effectiveness of 
the CIP.
Finally to reflect current market 
practice, the committee has made 
minor amendments to the PSP and the 
CIP to permit the exercise of any future 
grants of performance shares as nil (or 
nominal) cost options to continue until 
the tenth anniversary of the award date.
Performance Share Plan
The PSP remains the primary long-term 
incentive for the executive directors and 
other senior executives. The committee 
has the ability to approve the grant of 
performance shares worth up to 100% 
of salary each year (with a 200% limit in 
exceptional circumstances).
To the extent that PSP awards vest, 
participants will receive the benefit of 
any dividends paid over the vesting 
period in the form of share-based 
dividend equivalents.
In 2012, the committee will limit 
individual awards to executive directors 
to 100% of salary. Vesting of these 
awards will be subject to two 
performance conditions that will 
operate independently of each other. 
Half of an award will be based upon 
a performance condition related to 
adjusted EPS and the other half will be 
based upon post-tax ROIC, with each 
half vesting in accordance with the table 
set out below. The committee believes 
that the use of these two financial 
metrics provides strong alignment with 
both shareholder interests and the 
company's current strategic goals.
To the extent that PSP awards vest, 
participants will receive the benefit of 
any dividends paid over the vesting 
period in the form of share-based 
dividend equivalents.
Co  Investment Plan
The CIP operates as follows:
k  selected executives are able to invest 
into the CIP certain company shares 
that they are deemed to hold, worth 
up to a maximum of 35% of their 
salary per annum. These shares are 
called  investment shares'; 64
Berendsen plc Report and Accounts 2011
k  in return for investment shares being 
invested into the CIP, the executive is 
then granted an award over company 
shares that on a pre-tax basis 
matches the number of investment 
shares. Matching awards can be 
granted either as guaranteed 
matching awards (awards that are not 
subject to performance conditions) 
and/or as performance-related 
matching awards (awards that are 
subject to performance conditions);
k  invested shares subject to 
performance conditions may 
be matched up to 3:2; invested 
shares not subject to performance 
conditions may be matched up to 1:2;
k  taking both types of awards together, 
the maximum matching ratio can 
never exceed 2:1;
k  matching awards normally vest 
three years after the grant date to 
the extent that the performance 
conditions have been satisfied. 
Matching awards would then vest 
in the ratios shown in the table below 
(matching shares to investment 
shares); and
k  to the extent that matching awards 
vest, participants receive the benefit 
of any dividends paid over the vesting 
period in the form of share-based 
dividend equivalents.
Although the committee recognises 
that the guaranteed match is unusual, 
the CIP has resulted in significant 
personal investments in Berendsen 
shares by participants, and the 
committee continues to believe the 
plan helps align management with 
shareholders, by encouraging greater 
share ownership. As stated above, the 
Committee will review the ongoing 
effectiveness of the CIP in 2012.
In 2011, the Chief Executive Officer and 
the Finance Director invested shares 
worth 30% and 35% respectively of 
salary and their shareholdings as at 
31st December 2011 are 76,861 shares 
and 74,359 shares respectively.
The committee regards the above targets 
to be challenging in the current economic 
environment and highly stretching at the 
top end of the target range. 
Vested/lapsed awards
The 2008 PSP award was due to vest 
in March 2011. Vesting was dependent 
upon TSR performance relative to the 
FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment 
trusts). The TSR performance placed 
the company marginally below the 
median and the award has therefore 
lapsed.
Pension and non  cash benefits
Peter Ventress and Kevin Quinn have 
personal pension arrangements to which 
the company makes contributions 
equivalent to (respectively) 25% and 20% 
of salary, paid either to their personal 
pension arrangements or as a pension 
supplement. Additional benefits such as 
life assurance cover of four times salary, 
permanent health insurance of up to 75% 
of salary, medical insurance and a car 
(or car allowance) are also provided.
Other share plans
Other senior executives have been eligible 
to participate in the Executive Incentive 
Plan (EIP) which is a share-based 
incentive plan under which awards are 
granted subject to stretching three-year 
performance conditions based on 
financial measures relevant to the 
particular business function or division.
Report on directors' remuneration (continued)
As part of the below-board reward 
strategy review, in 2012 new share 
and cash based incentive plans will 
be introduced to replace the EIP. 
Under these plans, awards of either 
cash or shares may be granted subject 
to a combination of group and business 
line targets that are measured over 
different timeframes.
All UK and Irish employees, including 
executive directors, are also eligible 
to participate in the company's 
Sharesave Plan.
Importance of share ownership
The committee recognises the 
importance and value of having 
executive directors and other senior 
employees working towards holding 
shares with a value equivalent to 100% 
of their annual salary. To achieve this 
senior management are not permitted 
to sell any vested shares under the 
PSP or the CIP (other than to satisfy 
tax liabilities) until these guidelines 
are satisfied.

On termination, the directors would

contributions in respect of their 
outstanding notice period. 
In determining compensation levels 
on termination, the committee would 
have regard to best practice and the 
individual's duty to mitigate their loss.
Under their service agreements, 
executive directors are allowed 
(subject to board approval) to hold 
one non-executive post and retain 
the fee received from any such post.
Chairman and  
non-executive directors
The Chairman's annual fee is set by the 
committee and is currently  143,500 
(2011:  140,000). The non-executive 
directors receive annual fees at a level 
approved by the entire board, currently

additional  5,125 (2011:  5,000) if 
appointed the Senior Independent 
Director. They are able to claim 
reimbursement of actual expenditure 
incurred in carrying out their duties. 
There is no entitlement to participate 
in the company's pension scheme, 
bonus scheme or share plans and no 
compensation is payable for early 
termination of their contracts or terms 
of office.
Christopher Kemball the current 
Chairman will retire from the board 
on 26th April 2012. No compensation 
payment will be made. Iain Ferguson will 
be appointed Chairman with effect from 
26th April for a fixed term of three years 
to 30th April 2015, terminable at six 
months' notice by either party.
The terms of office of non-executive 
directors are for periods not exceeding 
three years which can be terminated by 
either party giving one month's notice. 
These terms of office are subject to 
shareholder approval when non-
executive directors seek re-election 
at Annual General Meetings. 
Total shareholder return
The committee believes that, due to the 
size of the company, the FTSE Mid 250 
Index (excluding Investment Trusts) 
is the most appropriate index against 
which to compare the historic TSR of 
the company. The chart below shows 
the TSR of the company compared 
with the index over the five-year period 
to 31st December 2011. Since December 
2006, the company TSR has 
outperformed the FTSE 250 (excluding 
investment trusts).

Notes
(i)  The closing mid-market price of the ordinary shares at 31st December 2011 was 435.2 pence and during the year ranged from 402.7 pence to 568.0 pence.
(ii)  Awards granted to executive directors in March 2010 were subject to a mixture of EPS and post-tax ROIC performance targets. The EPS target (applying to half of 
the awards) requires EPS of 47 pence in 2012 for 25% to vest rising to full vesting for EPS of 53 pence or higher. The ROIC target (applying to the other half of awards) 
requires ROIC of 7.5% over the period 2010-2012 for 25% to vest rising to full vesting for average ROIC of 10.5% or higher.
(iii)  Awards granted to executive directors in March 2011 were subject to a mixture of EPS and post-tax ROIC performance targets. The EPS target (applying to half of 
the awards) requires EPS of 53 pence in 2013 for 25% to vest rising to full vesting for EPS of 59 pence or higher. The ROIC target (applying to the other half of awards) 
requires ROIC of 8.5% for the 12 months ending 31st December 2013 for 25% to vest rising to full vesting for average ROIC of 10.5% or higher.
(iv)  Awards granted to executive directors in March 2009 were subject to a mixture of EPS and post-tax ROIC performance targets. The EPS target (applying to half of 
the awards) requires EPS of 43 pence in 2011 for 25% to vest rising to full vesting for EPS of 47 pence or higher. The ROIC target (applying to the other half of awards) 
requires ROIC of 7% over the period 2009-2011 for 25% to vest rising to full vesting for average ROIC of 10% or higher. Current indications are that the performance 
conditions will be satisfied at 68.75%. This equates to 97,105 awards vesting for Kevin Quinn (inclusive of dividend equivalents in the form of shares).
(v)  These share awards were granted in respect of performance and will vest after three years subject normally to continued employment. On 4th March 2011, 8,797 shares 
(including 901 dividend equivalents) vested. The share price at the date of vesting was 488.1 pence.
(vi)  The share award was not subject to any performance conditions as it was compensating Peter Ventress for the loss of non-performance related share-based awards 
granted to him by his previous employer.
(vii)  Further details of the Co-Investment Plan and performance conditions are detailed on page 64. The matching awards granted to executive directors in March 2010 were 
subject to a mixture of EPS and post-tax ROIC performance targets. The EPS target (applying to half of the awards) requires EPS of 47 pence in 2012 for 25% to vest 
rising to full vesting for EPS of 53 pence or higher. The ROIC target (applying to the other half of awards) requires ROIC of 7.5% over the period 2010-2012 for 25% to vest 
rising to full vesting for average ROIC of 10.5% or higher.
(viii)  The matching awards granted to executive directors in March 2011 were subject to a mixture of EPS and post-tax ROIC performance targets. The EPS target (applying 
to half of the awards) requires EPS of 53 pence in 2013 for 25% to vest rising to full vesting for EPS of 59 pence or higher. The ROIC target (applying to the other half of 
awards) requires ROIC of 8.5% for the 12 months ending 31st December 2013 for 25% to vest rising to full vesting for average ROIC of 10.5% or higher.
