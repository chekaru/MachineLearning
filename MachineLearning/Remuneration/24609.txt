Report on directors' remuneration
Transparent 
remuneration.
I am very aware of how important it is to get the strategy, structure  
and levels of remuneration right for the group's executive directors  
and other members of the senior management team. A responsible 
approach to remuneration should always support the company's  
overall strategic aims and objectives, not dictate them. Furthermore 
shareholders should be able to clearly understand and appreciate  
the link between reward and performance. This year, at Berendsen,  
we have focused on remuneration being accountable and transparent  
by providing clear and relevant reporting for how we recognise  
and reward employees at all levels as we work towards delivering  
our stated business aims and objectives.
Remuneration continues to be a hot 
topic and in June 2012 the Department 
for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) 
published draft proposals for new 
regulations on executive pay in UK 
listed companies intended to create a 
more robust framework within which 
executive pay can be set, agreed and 
implemented. Specifically, the new 
proposals are designed to improve 
the link between pay and long-term 
performance by promoting greater 
disclosure, transparency and 
accountability, to reduce rewards 
for failure and to promote better 
engagement between companies 
and their shareholders.
At Berendsen we endorse the aims 
of the BIS proposals and I believe that 
our own approach to remuneration 
already satisfies much of what BIS 
is proposing. 
Whilst, at the time of writing, the 
proposals have not been finalised, 
we have decided to adopt a number 
of the expected reforms in advance 
of being formally required to do so. 
The remuneration report in respect 
of 2013 will be fully compliant with 
the new requirements.
As promised in last year's remuneration 
report, we have now reviewed the 
effectiveness of the company's 
Co-Investment Plan (CIP) and 
concluded that changes should be 
made. The Remuneration Policy on 
page 71 explains the changes to the 
CIP in greater detail. 
A resolution will be put to shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting on 
25 April 2013 asking them to approve 
this report.

Role and responsibilities of 
the remuneration committee
The role of the remuneration committee 
is to determine and recommend 
to the board a fair and responsible 
framework for remuneration designed 
to ensure that senior management 
are appropriately rewarded and 
incentivised for their contribution to 
the company's overall performance. 
The remuneration committee sets 
the strategy, structure and levels of 
remuneration for the executive directors 
and oversees remuneration generally 
throughout the group. The committee's 
key responsibilities are to ensure that the 
company's remuneration strategy:
 k is capable of securing, retaining and 
motivating high calibre individuals 
to deliver results for shareholders, 
customers and employees alike;
 k reinforces the company's strategic 
aims and objectives, whilst mitigating 
any risk factors;
 k is aligned to maximising shareholder 
value on a sustainable basis; and
 k is market competitive, rewarding 
individuals in line with genuine 
performance.
The committee's composition, 
responsibilities and operation comply 
with the principles of good governance 
(as set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code), with the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Services Authority and 
with the Companies Act 2006. The full 
terms of reference for the committee can 
be found on the company's website at 
www.berendsen.com.

Remuneration advisers
In undertaking its responsibilities, the 
committee seeks independent external 
advice as necessary. Kepler Associates 
were appointed by the committee in 
September 2010 following a formal 
tendering of remuneration consultants. 
During 2012, Kepler Associates (who 
provided no other services to the 
company) remained the committee's 
independent remuneration adviser and 
received quarterly retainer fees of 
 7,500 which covered attendance at a 
set number of remuneration committee 
meetings, general advice and 
benchmarking exercises. Additional ad 
hoc work is carried out at an agreed 
hourly rate. The total fee paid to Kepler 
Associates during the year ending 
31 December 2012 was  31,400. In 
addition to the external remuneration 
consultants, the committee also takes 
internal soundings from various senior 
executives and managers who may be 
invited to join the committee in meeting. 
Shareholder engagement and voting
At the 2012 AGM, 91% of shareholders 
voted in favour of the remuneration 
report. Whilst the level of support has 
gradually increased in previous years, 
there remained concerns over the 
structure of the Co-Investment Plan 
(CIP). In August 2012 the committee 
carried out a review of the effectiveness 
of the CIP. Following this review, David 
Lowden, on behalf of the committee, 
consulted with a number of institutional 
investors about certain changes that 
were proposed to be made to the CIP, 
specifically the removal of the 
guaranteed match for future awards to 
be replaced with a performance-based 
match. The outcome of the consultation 
was considered and the guaranteed 
match has now been removed for all 
future grants - i.e. for future 
investments, the full match will be 
subject to performance targets (see 
page 73 for further details). The 
committee will continue to listen to and 
engage with shareholders with regard 
to all aspects of the company's 
remuneration policy and to take 
appropriate action when required.

Remuneration Policy for 2013
This Remuneration Policy explains 
how the remuneration strategy will 
be executed during 2013. The aim 
of the policy is to:
 k ensure that remuneration levels for 
the company's senior executives 
take into account their skills and 
experience, the nature and complexity 
of their responsibilities, relevant 
comparative market data and any 
unforeseen factors that may arise 
from time to time;
 k provide an appropriate package of 
benefits that is balanced between:
- fixed and variable pay, with at least 
half variable at target performance;
- short and long-term incentives;
 k recognise and reward stretching 
performance and appropriate 
risk-reward behaviours.
What is new in 2013?
The main policy change has been to 
amend the Co-Investment Plan (CIP) 
in relation to future grants of matching 
awards by replacing the existing 
guaranteed (i.e. non-performance 
related) match with a performance-
based match. From 2013 all grants 
of matching awards will be subject 
to the same performance conditions 
(and targets). Whilst the maximum 
matching ratio (2:1) will remain 
unchanged, the addition of performance 
conditions for all matching awards will 
mean that overall the expected value of 
CIP awards for participants will be less.
Finally, new accounting rules under 
IAS 19  Employee Benefits' came into 
effect on 1 January 2013 and affect 
how surpluses and deficits in defined 
benefit pension schemes are calculated. 
One remuneration side effect of this 
accounting change is that EPS targets 
that are relevant to awards granted 
under the company's long-term 
incentive plans will need to be restated 
in order to ensure consistency of 
treatment over the relevant EPS 
measurement period. Accordingly, 
EPS targets with measurement periods 
ending in 2013 and 2014 will be adjusted 
to reflect the changes in IAS 19. Further 
information is provided on page 20. The 
committee is satisfied that the restated 
EPS targets remain no less challenging.
Regular dialogue with stakeholders helps us 
shape our strategy. In October 2012, following 
a review by the remuneration committee of the 
effectiveness of the Co-Investment Plan (CIP), 
David Lowden contacted 26 shareholders, 
representing 70% of our issued share capital, 
to canvas views on our plans to remove the 
guaranteed match. Positive feedback was 
received from all shareholders who replied to the 
consultation letter and changes to the CIP rules 
were made in December 2012.

Report on directors' remuneration
Key elements of remuneration
The key elements of remuneration for the executive directors are set out below.
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum potential value Performance conditions
Salary T o recognise the responsibilities 
of the role and the experience, 
skills and performance of 
the individual.
Reviewed annually taking 
into account:
 k group and individual 
performance; and
 k pay levels and salary 
increases throughout the 
company and the group.
Salary increases are not 
automatic.
Chief Executive Officer - 
 545,000; Chief Financial 
Officer -  336,000
Increases broadly consistent 
with average increases across 
the group.
Increases in excess of the general 
policy may be sanctioned, for 
example in order to recognise:
 k an executive director assuming 
additional responsibilities in 
relation to the role they perform; 
 k a new hire;
 k market competitiveness.
None.
Benefits-in-kind T o be market competitive for 
the purposes of recruitment 
and retention.
Executive directors are entitled to 
a fully expensed car ( or cash 
allowance), life, permanent health 
and medical insurance.
 35,000 per annum. None.
Annual bonus T o drive and reward the 
achievement of challenging 
annual targets based upon 
financial and non-financial 
performance conditions that 
support the company's short- 
to medium-term strategy. 
In particular the annual bonus 
is intended to reinforce our 
medium-term objectives of 
delivering organic revenue 
growth of GDP+1-2%, high single 
digit EPS growth and cash 
conversion of at least 100%, as 
well as to recognise individual 
contribution during the year.
Performance conditions and 
targets are reviewed annually 
at the start of the financial year 
as are the threshold levels of 
performance for each of the 
financial performance conditions.
A quarter of any bonus paid is 
compulsorily deferred and paid 
in shares under the company's 
Deferred Bonus Share Plan that 
vests after three years subject to 
continued employment over that 
period and with the benefit of any 
dividends paid over the deferral 
period (in the form of share-based 
dividend equivalents ).
On-target core bonus opportunity 
is set at 60% of base salary, 
with 100% of salary available 
for achieving maximum levels 
of performance. 
In support of the group's 
medium-to long-term strategy, 
a performance multiplier 
operates by allowing the core 
maximum bonus opportunity 
of 100% of salary to be increased 
or decreased by up to 30% 
depending upon the extent to 
which personal objectives have 
been achieved. These objectives 
are specific to each executive.
There are three annual 
financial performance 
conditions that will determine 
bonus payments, namely:
 k adjusted earnings per share 
(50%);
 k the generation of free cash flow 
(25%); and
 k sales growth (25%).
Bonus payments will only be 
made provided that the earnings 
per share threshold has first 
been achieved.
Long-term 
incentive plans
T o drive and reward delivery 
of sustained shareholder 
returns through the satisfaction 
of challenging performance 
conditions and targets linked 
to the company's current 
strategic goals.
Specifically, the performance 
targets are linked to our long-term 
objective of achieving high-single-
digit underlying EPS growth and 
approaching double-digit 
post-tax ROIC.
Participation in the plans is 
intended to encourage executive 
share ownership and support 
alignment with shareholders 
and retention.
The 2006 Performance 
Share Plan (PSP) is the 
company's primary long-term 
incentive vehicle. 
Participants in the 2009 
Co-Investment Plan (CIP) can 
invest up to 35% of their salary 
in shares annually which may 
be matched.
T o the extent that PSP and CIP 
awards vest, participants will 
receive the benefit of any 
dividends paid over the vesting 
period in the form of share-based 
dividend equivalents.
PSP: up to 100% of base salary 
each year (200% in exceptional 
circumstances).
CIP: matching awards can be 
granted on a maximum matching 
ratio of two for one (gross of tax) 
to  match' the number of shares 
the participant has invested in 
the plan.
PSP and CIP awards vest at 
the end of a three-year 
measurement period subject 
to the performance of two 
equally weighted independent 
performance conditions: 
 k adjusted earnings per share 
(EPS); and
 k the weighted average post-tax 
return on invested capital 
(ROIC).
PSP and CIP awards will vest 
in accordance with the table 
opposite.
From 2013 the committee will 
also apply performance 
conditions to the match that was 
previously guaranteed, such that 
all future matching awards under 
the CIP are now subject to 
performance. This is the only 
change to executive remuneration 
policy for 2013.
Pension T o provide competitive 
retirement benefits and 
reward continuing service.
Contributions are made by 
the company to the executive 
director's personal pension 
scheme or the contributions 
are taken as a cash 
pension supplement.
Contributions are equivalent 
to 25% (for the Chief Executive 
Officer) and 20% (for the Chief 
Financial Officer) of base salary.

2013 PSP and CIP performance targets
The committee has approved the following targets for the 2013 PSP and CIP grants:
EPS performance targets 
to be satisfied in 2015 PSP vesting
Ratio of CIP 
matching that vests
Less than 61.5p 0% of award vests 0%
61.5p 25% of award vests 0.25:1
67.5p 100% of award vests 1:1
Between 61.5p and 67 .5p Straight-line basis Straight-line basis
Weighted Average ROIC to be satisfied for 
the 12-month period to 31 December 2015
Less than 9.5% 0% of award vests 0%
9.5% 25% of award vests 0.25:1
11% 100% of award vests 1:1
Between 9.5% and 11% Straight-line basis Straight-line basis
Actual 2012 performance (being performance for the financial year ending immediately prior to the date of grant) was 52.2 pence 
for adjusted EPS and 8.5 % for ROIC. The above EPS targets will need to be adjusted to reflect the changes to IAS19 Employee 
Benefits  which became effective from 1 January 2013. As outlined on page 20, this change in accounting policy is estimated to 
reduce EPS by 1.5 pence per year. 
As noted above, EPS and ROIC are used for both the Performance Share Plan and 
the Co-Investment Plan. The committee considers that when taken together, EPS 
and ROIC are the most accurate measure of long-term performance at Berendsen, 
balancing growth and returns whilst providing a good line of sight for executives. 
Although the committee has previously considered other performance measures, 
it was felt that a consistent basis for measuring long-term performance for all 
long-term incentive plans was easier to understand and therefore more motivational. 
This approach is also fairer as it helps ensure that all executives (including those who 
cannot fully participate in the CIP) are focused on achieving the same results.
The potential reward opportunities illustrated above are based on the policy which will apply in the forthcoming financial year, 
applied to the base salary effective 1 January 2013. For the annual bonus, the amounts illustrated are those potentially receivable 
in respect of performance for 2013. For the CIP, the award opportunities assume the full voluntary investment in Berendsen 
shares. It should be noted that any awards granted under the CIP and PSP in a year do not normally vest until the third 
anniversary of the date of grant. The projected values of CIP and PSP amounts exclude the impact of share price growth and 
dividend accrual. Illustrations are intended to provide further information to shareholders regarding the pay for performance 
relationship. However, actual pay delivered will be influenced by changes in share price and the vesting period of awards. The 
following assumptions have been made in compiling the above charts:

Employee remuneration 
and engagement
When reviewing and setting executive 
remuneration, the committee takes 
into account the pay and employment 
conditions of all employees of the 
company and group. Specifically, the 
level of any company-wide pay review 
is a key determinant when setting the 
level of any salary increase for the 
executive directors. For example, 
in 2012 the average salary increase 
for UK employees (excluding the 
executive directors and including laundry 
operatives and management) was 2.8%. 
For the executive board it was 2.7%. 
Although the company has not carried 
out a formal employee consultation 
regarding board remuneration, it does 
comply with local regulations and 
practices regarding employee 
consultation more broadly. The Group 
Director, Human Resources ensures that 
the committee is made aware of any 
relevant employee feedback regarding 
the company's remuneration policy.
Service contracts and 
termination payments
The table below sets out the key terms 
of the current executive directors' service 
contracts and also represents the 
committee's policy in this area.
Provision Detailed terms and policy
Notice period 12 months' notice terminable

Report on directors' remuneration
In addition to the termination payment 
terms set out on the previous page, if an 
executive director ceases employment 
for a  good leaver' reason (typically an 
involuntary leaver circumstance such as 
ill health, injury, redundancy, retirement, 
etc ) then under the terms of the company's 
long-term incentive plans (namely the 
PSP and the CIP, together being the 
 L TIP') awards over shares so granted 
will be reduced on a time pro rated basis 
with vesting on the normal vesting date 
subject to the satisfaction of the relevant 
performance conditions. If an executive 
director ceases employment for any 
other reason, any unvested L TIP awards 
would lapse. Under the company's 
deferred bonus plan, awards will only 
vest on termination provided that the 
executive director is a  good leaver' (there 
is no pro rating for time). The committee 
retains discretion to vary the treatment 
of awards depending on the individual 
circumstances, to ensure a fair outcome 
for both the participant and shareholders.

Peter Ventress  527,875  545,000 3.2%
Kevin Quinn  325,950  336,000 3.1%
As explained on page 3, the company 
continues to make excellent progress 
towards delivering upon the results 
of its 2010 strategic review and, in a 
number of respects (such as free 
cash flow generation), the committee 
believes outstanding progress has 
been made. T aking into account 
the company's financial results, the 
satisfaction of challenging personal 
objectives and the overall economic 
environment, the committee believes 
that the above salary increases are 
appropriate, fair and proportionate.
Annual bonuses
As can be seen from the table opposite, 
the annual bonus opportunity (core 
award plus performance multiplier) for 
executive directors in 2012 was 130% of 
salary and is determined by reference 
to the following performance metrics: 
(a) EPS; (b) the generation of free cash 
flow (FCF); and (c) revenue growth, with 
any bonus payments being conditional 
upon the threshold EPS target having 
first been achieved. 
The performance multiplier operated to 
allow the core award of up to 100% of 
base salary to be increased or decreased 
by up to 30% as a result of the 
achievement of personal objectives. For 
Peter Ventress, his personal objectives 
for 2012 included the successful 
implementation of the new business line 
structure, overseeing the timely delivery 
of internal initiatives including capital 
efficiency, procurement, sales 
development and pricing and contract 
terms programmes, and driving the 
talent management and diversity 
programmes throughout the business. 
Kevin Quinn's personal objectives for 
2012 included reviewing our IT strategy, 
delivering the full benefits of the Capital 
Efficiency programme and working 
alongside Group HR to implement a 
policy and measures to improve the 
diversity within our management teams. 
The table below sets out the annual 
bonuses awarded to the Chief Executive 
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. 
In 2012, the group increased EPS by 8% 
and delivered  125.1 million of free cash 
flow (cash conversion of 142% of 
adjusted profit after tax).
For executive directors in 2012, 25% of 
any bonus earned was paid in the form 
of deferred shares under the company's 
Deferred Bonus Share Plan.
Long-term incentive plans
Performance Share Plan - 2012 Grant
Annual grants are capped at 100% 
of salary. However, in exceptional 
circumstances, annual awards of up 
to 200% of salary may be awarded. 
During 2012, awards were granted to 
executive directors equal to 100% of 
base salary. Vesting of these awards 
will be subject to two performance 
conditions that will operate 
independently of each other. Half 
of an award will be based upon a 
performance condition related to 
adjusted EPS and the other half will 
be based upon weighted average 
post-tax ROIC, with each half vesting 
in accordance with the table set out 
on the next page.
T o the extent that PSP awards vest, 
participants will receive the benefit 
of any dividends paid over the vesting 
period in the form of share-based 
dividend equivalents.
There are no other issues to report nor 
were any discretions exercised, with 
regard to the operation of the PSP.
Co  Investment Plan - 2012 Grant
Awards were granted under the CIP 
under which executive directors are able 
to invest into the CIP certain company 
shares that they are deemed to hold, 
worth up to a maximum of 35% of their 
salary per annum. These shares are 
called  investment shares';
 k in return for investment shares being 
invested into the CIP, the executive 
is granted an award over company 
shares that on a pre-tax basis matches 
the number of investment shares. 
Matching awards can be granted 
either as guaranteed matching awards 
(awards that are not subject to 
performance conditions) and/or as 
performance-related matching 
awards (awards that are subject to 
performance conditions);
 k invested shares subject to 
performance conditions may be 
matched up to 3:2; invested shares not 
subject to performance conditions 
may be matched up to 1:2;
 k taking both types of awards together, 
the maximum matching ratio can 
never exceed 2:1;
 k matching awards normally vest 
three years after the grant date to 
the extent that the performance 
conditions have been satisfied. 
Matching awards would then vest 
in the ratios shown in the table 
opposite (matching shares to 
investment shares); and
 k to the extent that matching awards 
vest, participants receive the benefit 
of any dividends paid over the vesting 
period in the form of share-based 
dividend equivalents.

At the time of the introduction of the CIP 
in 2009, the purpose of the guaranteed 
match was to ensure significant personal 
investment in the company by 
management, thereby encouraging 
them to immediately focus on aligning 
their interests with those of shareholders. 
Following a review of the continuing 
effectiveness of the CIP, the committee 
concluded that the objectives of the 
guaranteed match had been achieved 
and that it was now appropriate to 
remove it from the 2013 awards onwards.
In 2012, the Chief Executive Officer 
and the Chief Financial Officer invested 
shares worth 35% of salary and their 
shareholdings as at 31 December 
2012 were 77,196 and 120,969 
shares respectively.

The actual 2011 performance (being the base year 
performance for these grants) was 48.4 pence for adjusted 
EPS and 7.9% for ROIC. The EPS targets above (56p to 62p) 
equates to growth of approximately 16% to 28% over the three 
year period.
* As explained on page 71, these EPS targets will need to be 
adjusted to reflect the changes to IAS 19 Employee Benefits  
with effect from 1 January 2013. No adjustments to ROIC will 
be necessary. Further information is provided on page 20.
Vested/lapsed awards
The 2009 PSP award vested on 5 March 2012. Vesting was subject 
to the achievement of performance conditions related to EPS and ROIC.

Other share plans Managing shareholder dilution
The table below sets out the available 
dilution capacity for the company's 
employee share plans based on the 
limits set out in the rules of those plans 
that relate to issuing new shares.

5% for executive plans - 
current dilution for discretionary 
( executive) plans 2.4%
Headroom relative to 5% limit 2.6%
Awards granted under the Sharesave 
Plan will be satisfied by the issue of 
new shares at the date of vesting, while 
awards granted under all other share-
based plans will be satisfied by shares 
purchased in the market and held in 
the company's Employee Benefit Trust. 
As at 31 December 2012 the Employee 
Benefit Trust held 2,921,735 shares.
Other senior executives have been 
granted awards under the Berendsen 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (BL TIP) 
which has replaced the Executive 
Incentive Plan. The BL TIP is a share-
based incentive plan under which 
awards are granted subject to a 
combination of group and business 
line performance targets that are 
measured over different timeframes.
All UK and Irish employees, including 
executive directors, are also eligible 
to participate in the company's 
Sharesave Plan.
Executive share ownership 
The committee recognises the 
importance and value of having 
executive directors and other senior 
employees working towards holding 
shares with a value equivalent to 100% 
of their annual salary. T o achieve this 
senior management are not permitted 
to sell any vested shares under the 
PSP or the CIP (other than to satisfy 
tax liabilities) until these guidelines 
are satisfied.
The current shareholdings as a 
percentage of annual salary, for Peter 
Ventress and Kevin Quinn are 87% 
and 220% (respectively), based on 
the closing mid-market share price 
on 31 December 2012. 76

Under their service agreements, executive directors are allowed (subject to board 
approval) to hold one non-executive post and retain their current fees. During 2012, 
Kevin Quinn was Chairman of the Business Services Association for which he 
received no additional remuneration. Service agreements of non-executive directors 
can be terminated by either party giving one month's notice. 
Chairman and non-executive directors' fees
The Chairman's annual fee is set by the committee and is currently  148,000 
(2012:  143,500). The non-executive directors receive annual fees at a level approved 
by the entire board, currently set at  44,500 (2012:  43,050) and an additional 
 10,250 (2012:  10,250) if they chair either the audit or remuneration committee 
and an additional  5,125 (2012:  5,125) if appointed the Senior Independent Director. 
They are able to claim reimbursement of actual expenditure incurred in carrying out 
their duties. There is no entitlement to participate in the company's pension scheme, 
bonus scheme or share plans and no compensation is payable for early termination 
of their contracts or terms of office. 
Total shareholder return 
The committee believes that, due to the size of the company, the FTSE Mid 250 
Index (excluding Investment Trusts) is the most appropriate index against which 
to compare the historic TSR of the company. The chart below shows the TSR of the 
company compared with the index over the five-year period to 31 December 2012. 
Since December 2008, the company's average TSR has outperformed the FTSE 250 
(excluding investment trusts).

(ii)  PSP 2010 Grant - Awards granted to executive directors in March 2010 were subject to a mixture of EPS and post-tax ROIC performance targets. The EPS target (applying to half of the awards) 
requires EPS of 47 pence in 2012 for 25% to vest rising to full vesting for EPS of 53 pence or higher. The ROIC target (applying to the other half of awards) requires ROIC of 7.5% over the period 
2010-2012 for 25% to vest rising to full vesting for average ROIC of 10.5% or higher. Current indications are that the performance conditions will be satisfied at 62.5%. This equates to 87,270

12 months ending 31 December 2013 for 25% to vest rising to full vesting for average ROIC of 10.5% or higher. As explained on page 71 these EPS targets will need to be adjusted to reflect the 
changes to IAS19  Employee Benefits' with effect from 1 January 2013. No adjustments to ROIC will be necessary. Further information is provided on page 20.
(iv)  PSP 2012 Grant - Awards granted to executive directors in March 2012 were subject to a mixture of EPS and post-tax ROIC performance targets. The EPS target (applying to half of the awards) 
requires EPS of 56 pence in 2014 for 25% to vest rising to full vesting for EPS of 62 pence or higher. The ROIC target (applying to the other half of awards) requires ROIC of 9% for the 12 months 
ending 31 December 2014 for 25% to vest rising to full vesting for average ROIC of 11% or higher. As explained on page 71 these EPS targets will need to be adjusted to reflect the changes to 
IAS19  Employee Benefits' with effect from 1 January 2013. No adjustments to ROIC will be necessary. Further information is provided on page 20.
(v)  PSP 2009 Grant - Awards granted to executive directors in March 2009 were subject to a mixture of EPS and post-tax ROIC performance targets. The EPS target (applying to half of the 
awards) requires EPS of 43 pence in 2011 for 25% to vest rising to full vesting for EPS of 47 pence or higher. The ROIC target (applying to the other half of awards) requires ROIC of 7% over the 
period 2009-2011 for 25% to vest rising to full vesting for average ROIC of 10% or higher. Following the vesting of awards on 5 March 2012 (which vested at a level of 68.75%), 97,105 Shares were

Deferred Bonus Share Plan will vest on 4 March 2013. Kevin Quinn is predicted to receive 13,068 shares (inclusive of dividend equivalents in the form of shares).
(vii)  The share award was not subject to any performance conditions as it was compensating Peter Ventress for the loss of non-performance related share-based awards granted to him by his 
previous employer. These awards can be exercised at anytime up to 17 December 2019, being the 10th anniversary of the grant date.
(viii)  CIP 2010 Grant - The matching awards granted to executive directors in March 2010 were subject to a mixture of EPS and post-tax ROIC performance targets. The EPS target (applying to

to reflect the changes to IAS19  Employee Benefits' with effect from 1 January 2013. No adjustments to ROIC will be necessary. Further information is provided on page 20.
(x)  CIP 2012 Grant - The matching awards granted to executive directors in March 2012 were subject to a mixture of EPS and post-tax ROIC performance targets. The EPS target (applying to
