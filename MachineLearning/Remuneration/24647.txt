Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present our Directors' 
remuneration report for 2013 which has 
been prepared in accordance with the 
new reporting and voting regulations 
governing the disclosure of executive 
remuneration that have recently come 
into force. I hope that you find this report 
even more helpful and informative about 
how we remunerate and incentivise our 
directors and that the new structure 
makes clear just how much thought 
and effort goes into developing and 
formulating a remuneration policy that 
is supportive of and aligned to, the 
company's strategic aims and objectives. 
Berendsen's strategy is to focus on 
organic revenue growth, improving 
operating margin through cost and 
operational efficiencies and converting 
this growth to cash. In this way we 
seek to improve returns and deliver 
sustainable shareholder value. In 2013, 
the company delivered excellent results 
and remains committed to these 
strategic objectives in 2014.
Since the inception of the strategic 
review in 2010, our share price has risen 
from 436.6p (market cap of  745.5m) 
on 31 December 2010 to 936.5p (market 
cap of  1,615.5m) on 31 December 2013 
and dividend payments have increased 
by 31.5%. 
In 2013, the year under review, the group 
increased adjusted earnings per share 
(EPS) by 18% and delivered  139.4 million 
of free cash flow (cash conversion of 
137% of adjusted profit after tax).
We believe that our remuneration policy 
has played a key and vital role in helping 
us to achieve our corporate goals and 
that shareholders have appreciated and 
benefited from our clarity of purpose 
both in explaining and then executing, 
our strategic vision. Looking to 2014 
and beyond, a remuneration policy that 
is adaptive, focused and supportive of 
what the company wants to achieve 
will be fundamental to incentivising the 
future creation of shareholder value.
During the year under review, there have 
been no substantial changes to the 
company's remuneration policy and 
none are anticipated in 2014. 
Operationally key decisions taken 
by the committee include:
 k Determined that salaries for Peter 
Ventress (Chief Executive Officer) and 
Kevin Quinn (Chief Financial Officer) 
should be increased by approximately 
1% (which is below the average 
increase throughout the group) 
reflecting the committee's 
commitment to balancing fixed 
remuneration and performance 
related incentives;
We have an effective 
remuneration strategy. 
Our remuneration strategy is driving business 
performance. Since we implemented our new 
strategy in January 2011, our total shareholder 
return has increased by 143%.
David Lowden
Chairman of the  
Remuneration Committee
