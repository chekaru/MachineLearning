Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present our Directors' 
remuneration report for 2013 which has 
been prepared in accordance with the 
new reporting and voting regulations 
governing the disclosure of executive 
remuneration that have recently come 
into force. I hope that you find this report 
even more helpful and informative about 
how we remunerate and incentivise our 
directors and that the new structure 
makes clear just how much thought 
and effort goes into developing and 
formulating a remuneration policy that 
is supportive of and aligned to, the 
company's strategic aims and objectives. 
Berendsen's strategy is to focus on 
organic revenue growth, improving 
operating margin through cost and 
operational efficiencies and converting 
this growth to cash. In this way we 
seek to improve returns and deliver 
sustainable shareholder value. In 2013, 
the company delivered excellent results 
and remains committed to these 
strategic objectives in 2014.
Since the inception of the strategic 
review in 2010, our share price has risen 
from 436.6p (market cap of  745.5m) 
on 31 December 2010 to 936.5p (market 
cap of  1,615.5m) on 31 December 2013 
and dividend payments have increased 
by 31.5%. 
In 2013, the year under review, the group 
increased adjusted earnings per share 
(EPS) by 18% and delivered  139.4 million 
of free cash flow (cash conversion of 
137% of adjusted profit after tax).
We believe that our remuneration policy 
has played a key and vital role in helping 
us to achieve our corporate goals and 
that shareholders have appreciated and 
benefited from our clarity of purpose 
both in explaining and then executing, 
our strategic vision. Looking to 2014 
and beyond, a remuneration policy that 
is adaptive, focused and supportive of 
what the company wants to achieve 
will be fundamental to incentivising the 
future creation of shareholder value.
During the year under review, there have 
been no substantial changes to the 
company's remuneration policy and 
none are anticipated in 2014. 
Operationally key decisions taken 
by the committee include:
 k Determined that salaries for Peter 
Ventress (Chief Executive Officer) and 
Kevin Quinn (Chief Financial Officer) 
should be increased by approximately 
1% (which is below the average 
increase throughout the group) 
reflecting the committee's 
commitment to balancing fixed 
remuneration and performance 
related incentives;
We have an effective 
remuneration strategy. 
Our remuneration strategy is driving business 
performance. Since we implemented our new 
strategy in January 2011, our total shareholder 
return has increased by 143%.

 k Approved annual bonus payments 
of 113.1% of salary, representing 
performance in excess of stretch under 
the free cash flow measure and 
between target and stretch under the 
EPS and revenue measure. Although 
financial performance has been 
stronger in 2013, bonus payments 
are broadly consistent with reward 
in 2012; and
 k Reviewed the extent to which the 
performance targets attached to 2011 
grants had been achieved as at 
31 December 2013. Awards made 
under the company's long-term 
incentive plans in 2011 are due to vest 
in March 2014 based upon the 
three-year performance period ending 
31 December 2013. Vesting is 
dependent upon EPS, with stretch 
performance set at 57.5 pence, and 
upon final year return on invested 
capital (ROIC), with stretch 
performance set at 10.5%. Based upon 
actual EPS of 59.8 pence and ROIC 
of 9.3%, 77.5% of awards will vest. 
Our other activities are explained in 
greater detail on page 89 and include:
 k The committee believes it is 
appropriate to review their appointed 
independent remuneration advisers on 
a regular basis. Following a rigorous 
tender process, T owers Watson were 
appointed with effect from 1 May 2013;
 k Reviewed letters from shareholders 
in respect of the new remuneration 
reporting regulations and guidance 
on the 2013 Directors' remuneration 
report; and
 k Agreed the financial targets for 
awards granted in 2014 under the 
PSP and CIP and the financial and 
personal targets for the Executive 
Board annual bonus.
On 28 November, I had the 
opportunity to meet nine of our largest 
shareholders at our annual shareholder 
dinner. This provided an excellent 
opportunity for me to discuss with our 
shareholders and receive feedback 
on both the group's strategy and our 
remuneration policy.
Under the new voting regime, two 
resolutions are being put to shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting on 
24 April 2014. One resolution will be 
seeking approval for the Policy Report 
(Part A) that explains the company's 
remuneration policy for executive 
directors effective from the 2014 AGM. 
The other is seeking approval for the 
rest of this report (Annual Report, Part 
B). I hope that you will be supportive of 
both resolutions.
Details of the voting at last year's AGM 
(based on a single resolution) are 
given on page 89, the committee was 
delighted to receive positive support on 
our remuneration strategy from 98.7% 
of shareholders who voted. We remain 
committed to ongoing engagement 
with our shareholders and take an active 
interest in your views and voting on this 
remuneration report.
If you would like to discuss any aspect 
of our remuneration strategy with 
me, please feel free to email me at 
RemcoChairman@berendsen.eu.

Rewarding performance
The board recognises the importance of 
ensuring senior management are sufficiently 
motivated to implement the group strategic 
plan. Management incentives are aligned 
to shareholder interests through the group. 
Since the introduction of our strategic plan in 
January 2011, our total shareholder return has 
increased by 143% compared to our benchmark 
of the FTSE 250 excluding investments trusts 
of 56%. During this period, the valuation of 
Berendsen to its shareholders has increased 
by  870 million. 
Increasing transparency
The committee understands the importance 
of providing information to shareholders 
that is both informative and transparent. 
Feedback from our 2012 remuneration report 
has been very positive with support from 98.7% 
of shareholders at our 2013 AGM. We were also 
nominated for the best FTSE 250 Annual Report 
from the ICSA T ransparency in Governance 
Awards 2013.
 
 Always moving forward...
+143%
increase in total shareholder return 
since January 2011.
