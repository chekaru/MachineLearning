Report on directors' remuneration
Part A: Policy Report
Remuneration policy
With effect from its approval at the 2014 AGM, this Policy Report sets out the framework that will inform how the company's 
remuneration strategy will be executed during 2014 and (it is anticipated) over the next three years, thereby ensuring that 
the structure and levels of executive remuneration continue to remain appropriate for the company. This is to be achieved 
by having a remuneration policy that:
 k Provides an appropriate mix of rewards, incentives and benefits that are balanced between:
 - Fixed and variable pay, with at least half variable at target performance; and
 - Short and long-term performance.
 k Ensures that remuneration levels for the company's senior executives take into account their skills and experience, the nature 
and complexity of their responsibilities, relevant comparative market data (typically executive pay is benchmarked against 
companies of a similar size to Berendsen selected primarily on the basis of market capitalisation but with consideration also 
given to revenue, sector and number of employees) and any unforeseen factors that may arise from time to time; and
 k Recognises and rewards stretching performance and appropriate risk-reward behaviours.
The committee is satisfied that these policy objectives remain appropriate and that there continues to be a sensible balance 
between fixed and variable elements of remuneration as set out in the  Future policy table' below. 
No changes to the remuneration policy will be made in 2014. The committee is aware that the Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
will expire in April 2016 and accordingly will review that plan in advance of this date. As a component of this review, the committee 
will consider the introduction of a formal clawback and/or malus policy. 
Remuneration for executive directors will consist of the following elements:
Future policy table
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and performance conditions (if applicable) Maximum potential value
Fixed remuneration
Salary
To recognise the responsibilities of 
the role and the experience, skills 
and performance of the individual 
and to attract and retain the 
highest calibre of Chief Executive 
Officer and executive directors. 
Reviewed annually, with any change having effect from 1 January and 
taking into account:
 k Group and individual performance; 
 k Pay levels and salary increases throughout the company and the 
group; and
 k Macro-economic factors.
Salary increases are not automatic and would broadly be consistent 
with average increases across the group. Increases in excess of general 
operation may be sanctioned for example in order to recognise:
 k An executive director assuming additional responsibilities in relation 
to the role they perform; and
 k Where an executive director's salary has fallen significantly below 
market competitive levels.
The base salaries of executive directors 
effective from 1 January 2014 (prior to 
this policy taking effect) are as follows:
Peter Ventress -  551,000
Kevin Quinn -  340,000
The maximum increase to be applied 
on an annual basis to the salaries 
effective 1 January 2014 or from 
appointment is inflation plus 5% 
per annum. At the discretion of the 
committee larger increases may 
be awarded in the circumstances 
described in the operation column.
Pension and benefits
To be market competitive for 
the purposes of recruitment, 
ensuring retention and to reward 
continuing service.
Pensions
Company contributions not exceeding a percentage of base salary 
are made to the executive director's personal pension scheme or the 
contributions are taken as a cash pension supplement.
Benefits
Company car (or cash allowance), life assurance cover equal to four 
times base salary, permanent health up to 75% of base salary and 
medical insurance. 
The committee retains the discretion to provide additional benefits 
as may be reasonably required to reflect changed circumstances 
(e.g. in relation to existing or new directors). These may include, 
but are not limited to: relocation costs, tax equalisation arrangements 
and cost of living allowances. 
25% of base salary.
The maximum value of the benefits is 
determined by the nature of each benefit 
itself and so can be adjusted in line with 
the relevant purchase cost. 83

Future policy table
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and performance conditions (if applicable) Maximum potential value
Variable remuneration
Annual bonus  
(cash and share-based)
To drive and reward the 
achievement of challenging 
annual targets based upon 
financial and non-financial 
performance measures that 
support the company's short-  
to medium-term strategy.
The annual bonus is intended to 
reinforce the company's short-
to medium-term objective of 
delivering organic revenue growth 
of GDP+1-2%, high single-digit EPS 
growth and cash conversion of  
at least 100%, as well as to 
recognise individual contribution 
during the year. 
Performance conditions and targets are reviewed at the start of each 
financial year as are the threshold levels of performance for each of the 
financial performance conditions. Performance is measured over the 
relevant financial year.
Three financial performance measures determine bonus payments 
worth up to 100% of salary:
 k Adjusted earnings per share (50%);
 k The generation of free cash flow (25%); and
 k Revenue (25%).
Bonus payments will only be made provided that the earnings per share 
threshold is achieved.
The amounts payable in relation to the financial performance 
measures are:
 k Threshold: 20% of salary.
 k Target: 60% of salary.
 k Maximum: 100% of salary.
Payments can be increased or decreased through the application of a 
multiplier depending on personal performance against measures linked to 
the individual's areas of responsibility and the overall strategy of the group. 
Personal measures are specific to the performance of each executive. 
Depending upon the extent to which the personal measures have been 
achieved, a performance multiplier then operates ( at the discretion of the 
committee) whereby the above amounts can be increased or decreased 
by up to 30%.
The committee retains the discretion to adjust annually the financial 
measures such that no financial measure accounts for more than 50% 
of the bonus outcome. This is to ensure that they remain appropriate and 
aligned with the company's strategy, subject to the overall maximum.
If changes to the performance measures/targets are contemplated, 
the committee will consider whether it is appropriate to consult with the 
company's main shareholders and their representative bodies ( depending 
on the extent of the change).
A quarter of any bonus paid is compulsorily deferred into an award over 
shares under the company's Deferred Bonus Share Plan (DBSP), that vest 
after three years subject to continued employment and with the benefit 
of any dividends paid over the deferral period (in the form of share-based 
dividend equivalents ).
The overall maximum bonus opportunity 
is 130% of salary.
Long-term incentive plans 
(primarily shares but 
with a cash alternative)
To drive and reward delivery 
of sustained shareholder 
returns through the satisfaction 
of challenging performance 
conditions and targets linked 
to the company's current 
strategic objectives.
Specifically, the performance 
targets are linked to our long-term 
objective of achieving high single-
digit underlying EPS growth and 
approaching double-digit post-
tax ROIC.
Participation in the plans 
is intended to encourage 
executive share ownership, 
to support greater alignment 
with shareholders and to act 
as a retention mechanism. 
The 2006 Performance Share Plan (PSP) is the company's primary 
long-term incentive vehicle. The 2009 Co-Investment Plan (CIP) is the 
company's secondary long-term incentive vehicle under which participants 
can invest up to 35% of their salary annually in shares, which is then 
matched on a gross basis with an award of shares granted by the company.
Awards are normally granted shortly after the announcement of results 
but can be granted at other times in exceptional circumstances.
T o the extent that PSP and CIP awards vest, participants will receive 
the benefit of any dividends paid over the vesting period in the form 
of share-based dividend equivalents.
PSP and CIP awards vest at the end of a three-year measurement 
period subject to the performance of two equally weighted 
independent performance measures:
 k Adjusted earnings per share (EPS); and
 k The weighted average post-tax return on invested capital (ROIC).
25% of the award will vest if the threshold performance condition is 
achieved and 100% of the award will vest for the achievement of the 
stretch target.
If changes to the performance measures/targets are contemplated, 
the committee will consider whether it is appropriate to consult with 
the company's main shareholders and their representative bodies 
(depending on the extent of the change).
Legacy awards made under the PSP and CIP prior to 1 January 2014, 
which may be subject to different performance criteria from those 
described above, will be permitted to vest in accordance with the terms 
agreed and disclosed at the time.
PSP: up to 100% of base salary each year 
(200% in exceptional circumstances 
such as recruitment or retention).
CIP: matching awards can be granted 
on a maximum matching ratio of two for 
one (gross of tax) to  match' the number 
of shares the participant has invested in 
the plan. For the purposes of CIP, and 
reflecting the international profile and 
tax residence of the participants, the 
committee applies a fixed 50% tax rate 
when granting CIP awards. This means 
that the maximum CIP award is 140% 
of salary provided that the participant 
makes the maximum investment.  84

All-Employee Share Plans 
(UK Sharesave)
Executive directors can save a fixed monthly amount from their net salaries 
for terms of three or five years. At the end of which, the accumulated savings 
can be used to purchase shares at an option price set on the date of grant 
(being a 20% reduction on the average share price at grant ).
The operation of the UK Sharesave Plan is consistent with HMRC practice 
and policy.
The statutory maximum monthly 
savings amount.
Other aspects
Share retention policy 
To encourage long-term 
investment by the directors 
thereby supporting greater 
alignment with shareholders.
Executive directors and senior management are required to work 
towards building a stake in the company. To achieve this senior 
management are not permitted to sell any vested shares under the 
PSP or the CIP (other than to satisfy tax liabilities) until this requirement 
is satisfied.
Shares owned outright by executive directors and their partners count 
towards the retention requirement. Awards that are unvested or not 
transferred are not counted.
Shareholding equivalent to 100% 
of base salary although this can be 
increased if the committee decided 
it is appropriate to do so.
Chairman and non-executive 
director fees
To attract and retain the 
highest calibre of Chairman and 
non-executive director.
Fees paid to the Chairman are determined by the committee whilst the 
fees paid to the non-executive directors are determined by the board.
The Chairman's fees are determined by reference to time commitment 
and previous experience.
The board determines fees for non-executive directors' under a policy 
that seeks to recognise time commitment, responsibility and the 
technical skills required to make a valuable contribution to the board.
Additional fees may be paid in respect of Chairmanship and membership 
of a board committee or for additional duties, such as serving as the 
Senior Independent Director.
Participation in any of the company pension schemes is not permitted.
Travel and subsistence for non-executive directors based outside of the 
UK for company-related business will be reimbursed by the company. 
Subject to board approval and ensuring that there are no conflicts of 
interest, executive directors can hold one non-executive directorship 
for which they retain their fees. 
The maximum aggregate value of fees 
payable to the Chairman and non-
executive directors will be  500,000, 
as set out in the Articles of Association.
Performance measures and target setting 
As noted in the  Future policy table' above, performance measures are determined annually to ensure continued alignment with 
Berendsen's corporate strategy, in order to both reward and incentivise its delivery. The 2014 annual bonus financial measures 
(adjusted EPS, free cash flow generation and revenue), were chosen in light of the stated strategic objectives to deliver organic 
revenue growth of GDP+1-2%, high single-digit EPS growth and cash conversion of at least 100%. Individual performance 
measures are chosen based on the areas that the committee wants to see improvement and/or progress on during the financial 
year in light of the overall strategic priorities for the company. This process of identifying and selecting performance measures 
does not change on an annual basis.
The 2014 long-term incentive measures (of absolute EPS and ROIC) were chosen as the committee considers them to be the 
most accurate measures of long-term company performance, balancing growth and investor returns whilst providing good 
line of sight for executives. In setting performance targets the committee takes account of internal and external forecasts and 
prevailing economic conditions.

The potential reward opportunities illustrated above are calculated using base salaries effective from 1 January 2014. For the 
annual bonus, the amounts illustrated are those potentially receivable in respect of performance for 2014. For the CIP, the award 
opportunities assume the full voluntary investment in Berendsen shares. It should be noted that any awards granted under 
the PSP and CIP in a year do not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant. The projected values of PSP 
and CIP amounts exclude the impact of share price growth and dividend accrual. Illustrations are intended to provide further 
information to shareholders regarding the pay for performance relationship. However, actual pay delivered will be influenced 
by changes in share price and the vesting period of awards. The assumptions set out below have been made in compiling the 
above charts:

Employee remuneration and engagement
When reviewing and setting executive remuneration, the committee takes into account the pay and employment conditions of all 
employees of the company and group. Specifically, the level of any company-wide pay review is a key determinant when setting 
the level of any salary increase for the executive directors and will be disclosed in the Annual Report each year. 
The company's approach to reward and remuneration is broadly consistent across the group however; executive remuneration 
is more heavily weighted towards variable elements of remuneration which are conditional upon the executive directors achieving 
performance targets linked to the successful delivery of strategy. This aims to create a clear link between the value created for 
shareholders and remuneration received by the executive directors. 
Managers across the group who participate in an annual bonus scheme have similar metrics to those used for executive directors. 
These are typically dependent upon the achievement of local business unit performance targets which can be a mixture of 
financial or personal objectives and are linked to the implementation of our strategic objectives. Other employees may also 
participate in a performance-led annual bonus plan. 
Senior managers are eligible to participate in the BL TIP (Berendsen Long-Term Incentive Plan) which rewards approximately 
100 managers for the achievement of strategic goals and encourages share ownership. T wo or three-year stretching performance 
targets, which are business unit specific, are set and managers received regular performance updates to ensure they are informed 
about their progress toward the achievement of targets. 
All permanent UK employees are invited to participate in the UK Sharesave Plan, which is explained within the  Future policy table'. 
Although the company has not carried out a formal employee consultation regarding board remuneration, it does comply with 
local regulations and practices regarding employee consultation more broadly. The Group Director, Human Resources ensures 
that the committee is made aware of any relevant employee feedback regarding the company's remuneration policy.
Further information about our engagement with employees across the group is provided in the  Our people' section on page 47.  86

Takeover
In the event of a takeover or other major corporate event (but excluding an internal reorganisation of the company), 
all outstanding awards granted under the company's discretion incentive plans (PSP and CIP) would vest subject to the 
achievement of any performance conditions and taking into account any pro rata reduction to reflect the unexpired part 
of the vesting period. The committee has discretion to disapply time pro rating if it considers it appropriate to do so.
In the event of an internal reorganisation, the committee may determine, with the agreement of the acquiring company, 
that outstanding awards would be exchanged for equivalent awards in another company.
Awards granted under the company's all-employee share plans would vest in accordance with the prescribed legislation. 
Payment of any bonuses will not be accelerated unless the committee determines otherwise, taking into account a variety of 
factors including the extent to which any performance conditions have been satisfied. Deferred bonus awards may vest in full.
Appointment of new directors
The policy for the appointment of new executive directors (both internal and external) is as follows. The new director's base 
salary will be set taking into account a range of factors including market levels, experience, internal relativities and cost. If base 
salary has been set at a level below the desired market level contingent on individual performance, the committee retains 
a discretion to realign the base salary over a phased period of one to three years following the appointment, which may result 
in an exceptional rate of annualised increase in excess of that set out in the  Future policy table' on page 83. 
Other elements of annual remuneration will be consistent with the  Future policy table' save that conduct conditions (allowing 
the company to recover unvested awards) may apply. The following exceptions to this approach will apply:
 k If an internal appointment is made, the committee retains the discretion to continue with any existing contractual remuneration 
provisions; and
 k The committee retains the discretion to make awards on recruitment under the PSP and CIP and/or an individual award 
agreement on similar terms, to provide an immediate interest with company performance. The committee will determine the 
level of the award, the performance conditions and time-horizon that would apply to such awards at the time of grant, taking 
into account the strategy and business circumstances at Berendsen. The maximum value of variable remuneration that may be 
granted is consistent with the  Future policy table', namely: 130% of salary bonus opportunity, a 35% of salary investment under 
the CIP and a 200% of salary award under the PSP (reducing to 100% on an ongoing basis).
 k The same principles shall apply if it is necessary for the Chairman or any non-executive director to assume executive function 
on a temporary basis.
Service contracts will be entered into on terms similar to those for the existing executive directors, summarised in our service 
contract policy opposite. The committee can also consider buying-out incentive awards that the individual has had to forfeit 
by accepting the appointment. This would be done either through the company's existing reward structures (as set out in the 
 Future policy table') or in accordance with and reliance upon any relevant provisions and procedures contained within the 
Listing Rules. Any awards or payments made in respect of forfeited remuneration would, as far as is possible or practicable, 
take into account the expected value, timing, form of delivery and the terms of, the forfeited remuneration. Wherever possible, 
any new arrangements would be linked to the achievement of Group targets. The committee may also require the individual 
to purchase company shares up to a pre-agreed level prior to vesting.
With respect to the appointment of a new Chairman or non-executive director, contractual terms will be consistent with those 
currently adopted. Variable pay will not be considered and as such no maximum applies (nil). In order to secure the appointment 
of a new Chairman not based in the UK, payments relating to relocation or repatriation (including house costs) can be considered.
An appropriate announcement of the director's appointment and the incumbent's remuneration will be made through 
a regulatory information service and posted on the company's website.
Unforeseen circumstances and change of law
The committee retains the discretion to make emergency payments outside of the policy described in exceptional and genuinely 
unforeseen circumstances. This discretion would extend to cover where the committee believes that this is in the best interest 
of the company and when it would be disproportionate to seek approval from a general meeting. Any payments or commitments 
to make such payments in such circumstances will be disclosed on a timely basis. 
In addition to the various operational discretions that the committee can exercise in the performance of its duties (including 
those discretions set out in the company's share plans), the committee reserves the right to make either minor or administrative 
amendments to the policy, if required, to benefit its operation or to make more material amendments in order to comply with 
substantially new laws and regulations. 88

The committee has authority to obtain the advice of external independent remuneration consultants and is solely responsible for their 
appointment, retention and termination. On 25 April 2013, following a rigorous tender process, the committee appointed T owers 
Watson ( one of the leading remuneration consultancies ) as its principal external remuneration adviser . T owers Watson, who provided 
no other services to the company (thereby, in the committee's opinion, validating its credentials for providing appropriate, objective 
and independent advice ), received quarterly retainer fees of  8,000 which covered attendance at a set number of committee 
meetings, general advice, benchmarking exercises and updates on remuneration developments. Additional ad hoc work is carried 
out at an agreed hourly rate. The total fee invoiced by T owers Watson during the year ending 31 December 2013 was  24,250. 
Kepler Associates, who were the remuneration advisers for the period 1 January 2013 to 25 April 2013 received a total fee of  9,000.

The graph below shows the total shareholder return (TSR) of the company compared with the index over the five-year period to 
31 December 2013. Since December 2008, the company's average TSR has outperformed the FTSE 250 (excluding investment 
trusts). The committee believes that, due to the size of the company, the FTSE Mid 250 Index (excluding Investment Trusts) is the 
most appropriate index against which to compare the historic TSR of the company.

Notes
(i)  The CIP guaranteed match (25% of the granted award) is not related to any performance conditions and therefore all guaranteed match awards are 
achieved at 100% of the potential maximum. The CIP grants awarded in 2010, 2011 and 2012 all contained a guaranteed match element. The 2013 CIP 
grant did not contain a guaranteed match and all awards are performance related. 
(ii)  Peter Ventress joined Berendsen on 1 November 2009 and was appointed to the board as Chief Executive on 1 January 2010. Peter was awarded 
a share award pursuant to Listing Rule 9.4.2(2) of 130,446 shares (non-performance) which were exercised on 8 April 2013 (share price upon vesting 
was 782.8 pence). Upon joining Berendsen, Peter was awarded a cash bonus of  200,000 which was paid in March 2010 on the condition that he 
acquired company shares worth at least  200,000.
(iii)  On 5 March 2012, Roger Dye received 53,385 awards (including dividend equivalents) under the PSP 2009 grant. The market price on the day 
of vesting was 512 pence. There are no further outstanding LTIP awards due to Roger Dye.

Annual bonus outcomes in 2013 (audited)
As can be seen from the table below, the annual bonus opportunity (core award plus performance multiplier) for executive 
directors in 2013 was 130% of salary and was determined by reference to the following financial performance metrics: 
(a) EPS; (b) the generation of free cash flow (FCF); and (c) revenue, with any bonus payments being conditional upon the 
threshold EPS target having first been achieved. 
In 2013, the group increased adjusted EPS by 18% and delivered  139.4 million of free cash flow (cash conversion of 137% 
of adjusted profit after tax). For executive directors in 2013, 25% of any bonus earned was paid in the form of deferred shares 
under the company's Deferred Bonus Share Plan.

The personal performance multiplier operated to increase the core award by 22.6% as a result of the achievement of personal 
performance criteria. Each executive director has three personal performance measures linked to areas that the committee has 
identified for the year. The committee reviews the progress in each area then makes an assessment of what the executive has 
delivered relative to expectations.

*The above EPS targets have been adjusted to reflect the changes required by IAS 19  Employee Benefits' which became effective from 1 January 2013
The 2012 performance (being the base year performance for these grants) was 50.7 pence for adjusted EPS and 8.5% for ROIC. 
The EPS targets above (60p to 66p) equate to growth of approximately 18% to 30% over the three-year period.
Details of grant
The PSP remains the primary long-term incentive plan for senior executives. Awards were granted to executive directors equal 
to 100% of base salary which equals 76,509 awards ( 544,999) for Peter Ventress and 47,168 awards ( 335,993) for Kevin Quinn. 
Vesting of these awards is subject to two performance conditions that operate independently of each other. Half of an award 
was based upon a performance condition relating to adjusted EPS and the other half was based upon weighted average post-
tax ROIC. Both performance conditions are measured over a three-year performance period. T o the extent that awards vest, the 
directors would receive the benefit of any dividends paid over the vesting period in the form of share-based dividend equivalents.
In return for  investment shares' (which can be worth up to a maximum of 35% of base salary per annum) being invested into the 
CIP, the director was granted a  matching' award over company shares that matches the number of investment shares on a 2:1 
pre-tax basis. Matching awards were subject to the same performance conditions and with the same right to receive a dividend 
equivalent, as PSP awards. Peter Ventress and Kevin Quinn invested shares amounting to 35% of base salary and were granted 
107,112 and 66,036 awards, respectively. 
Outside appointments for executive directors
Subject to board approval, the company encourages its executive directors to hold one non-executive position outside of 
the group, thereby broadening their experience and knowledge. Any fees may be retained by the director. Peter Ventress 
was appointed as a non-executive director of Premier Farnell plc, with effect from 1 October 2013, for which he received fees 
of  12,500 during 2013.  95

Implementation of policy in 2014
The remuneration policy is set out in Part A of this report. Below we detail how this policy will apply in 2014.
Base salary and fees 
Effective from 1 January 2014, the base salary of executive directors will be increased by approximately 1%, being  551,000 for 
Peter Ventress and  340,000 for Kevin Quinn. Non-executive directors' fees were increased by 4.6%, further details of the fees 
effective from 1 January 2014 are detailed below:

committee
Senior  
Independent  
Director
 155,000  46,500  10,750  5,350
The committee does not anticipate any changes to the implementation of the policy in the following year. Performance targets 
and variable remuneration will be granted on a similar basis as the current financial year.
Annual bonus: target setting for 2014
The annual bonus targets for 2014 will be in accordance with our policy, namely:
 k Adjusted earnings per share (50%);
 k The generation of free cash flow (25%); and
 k R e v e n u e ( 2 5 % ).
The committee will set calibrated targets for each of these three measures and intends to disclose actual performance against 
these targets in next year's directors' remuneration report. As a matter of commercial sensitivity, the committee has decided not 
to disclose performance targets in advance. 
LTIP: target setting for 2014
Awards will be granted in accordance with our policy, namely: up to 100% of base salary for PSP awards and up to 140% of base 
salary for CIP awards. For awards granted under the CIP and PSP in 2014, the committee has approved the following targets:
EPS performance targets to be satisfied in 2016 Awards vesting
Less than 67p 0% of award vests
67p 25% of award vests
77p 100% of award vests
Between 67p and 77p Straight-line basis

Less than 10% 0% of award vests
10% 25% of award vests
11% 100% of award vests
Between 10% and 11% Straight-line basis
These targets are based on actual 2013 performance (performance for the financial year ending immediately prior to the date 
of grant) being 59.8 pence for adjusted EPS and 9.3% for ROIC. The EPS targets above (67 pence to 77 pence) maximise with 
a growth of 29% over the three-year period. 96

Share retention policy
The committee recognises the importance and value of having executive directors and other senior employees working towards 
holding shares with a value equivalent to 100% of their base salary. T o achieve this senior management are not permitted to sell 
any vested shares under the PSP or the CIP (other than to satisfy tax liabilities) until these guidelines are satisfied. The current 
shareholdings as a percentage of base salary, for Peter Ventress and Kevin Quinn are 288% and 389% respectively based on the 
closing mid-market share price of 936.5 pence on 31 December 2013. 97

Notes 
(i)  The closing mid-market price of the ordinary shares at 31 December 2013 was 936.5 pence and during the year ranged from 607.5 pence to 
980.0 pence.
(ii)   PSP awards granted in March 2010 were subject to both EPS and post-tax ROIC performance targets. Following the vesting of awards on 4 March 2013 
(which vested at a level of 62.5%), 87,270 and 52,360 shares were transferred to Peter Ventress and Kevin Quinn, respectively (inclusive of dividend 
equivalents in the form of shares). The market price on the day of vesting was 702.2 pence. 
(iii)  PSP awards granted in March 2013 were subject to both EPS and post-tax ROIC performance targets. The EPS target (applying to half of an award) 
requires EPS of 60 pence in 2015 for 25% to vest rising to full vesting for EPS of 66 pence or higher. The ROIC target (applying to the other half of an 
award) requires average ROIC of 9.5% for the 12 months ending 31 December 2015 for 25% to vest rising to full vesting for average ROIC of 11% or higher. 
These EPS targets have been reduced by 1.5 pence to reflect the changes required by IAS 19  Employee Benefits' effective from 1 January 2013. 
No adjustment to ROIC targets was necessary. 
(iv)  CIP matching awards granted in April 2010 were subject to both EPS and post-tax ROIC performance targets. Following the vesting of awards on 
15 April 2013 (which vested at a level of 71.9%), 102,988 and 70,276 shares were transferred to Peter Ventress and Kevin Quinn, respectively (inclusive of 
dividend equivalents in the form of shares). The market price on the day of vesting was 739.3 pence. 
(v) CIP awards granted in April 2013 were subject to the same performance conditions as the PSP 2013 awards (see note (iii)).  98
