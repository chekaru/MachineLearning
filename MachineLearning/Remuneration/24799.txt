REMUNERATION REPORT
The Board of Directors presents its Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 April 2013, which has been prepared on the recommendation of 
the Remuneration Committee (the Committee ). An advisory resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting 
of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved. 
The report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code, Schedule 8 of the Large & 
Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority. 
INTRODUCTION 
Berkeley' s strategy places an emphasis on achieving two operational measures with which the Committee aims to align to the Executive' s 
remuneration. The first is achieving superior and sustainable pre-tax returns on shareholder equity (ROE ). The second is enhancing the value of 
the land bank. The combination of these two targets is designed to provide a balance between earnings in the near term and creating a long 
term, sustainable business.
In considering the level of the Executive' s Annual Bonus Plan the Committee has discussed the principles with major shareholders and aims to set 
these at a level that is both challenging and sector leading. The Group' s ROE compared with the sector over the last six years illustrates the 
relative performance of Berkeley:
 Return on Equity
Company 2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13
Berkeley 26.6% 16.2% 13.3% 15.3% 21.2% 22.4%
Sector highest 26.6% 16.2% 13.3% 15.3% 21.2% 22.4%
Sector lowest (0.7%) (73.4%) (44.2%) (6.2%) (0.4%) 3.4%
Sector average (excluding Berkeley) 18.2% (26.0%) (18.1%) 1.0% 4.8% 8.5%
The Committee sets annual targets that have a strong operational correlation with the performance of the business. Whilst the Committee 
considers total shareholder return (TSR) to be a helpful tool to measure performance over the long term, it believes that setting the right 
operational targets on an annual basis and putting in place a long term share based remuneration policy aligned to creating shareholder value 
above a hurdle level of return is the best way to deliver value for shareholders and to encourage, reward and retain the current Executives.
The TSR for Berkeley, expressed as the value of  100 invested in the Company, both from 25 June 2004, being the date on which the previous 
Scheme of Arrangement and consequential returns of surplus capital to shareholders was announced, and from 1 May 2010, the date on which 
the current Annual Bonus Plan was introduced, to 30 April 2013 is as follows:
 Value of  100 invested on
Company  25/06/2004 01/05/2010
Berkeley   526  252
FTSE 250   298  150

Persimmon   245  252
Redrow   97  143
Taylor Wimpey   63  233
Sector average (excluding Berkeley)   153  209
Berkeley has consistently out-performed the sector average and generated additional value for shareholders over a difficult and challenging 
period. 
At the 2011 AGM shareholders approved the Board' s strategy to return  1.7 billion ( 13 per share) to shareholders over the next 10 years, which 
has the following key features:
 	 It 	 strikes 	 the 	 right 	 balance 	 between 	 maximising 	 shar eholder 	 r eturns 	 and 	 an 	 acceptable 	 level 	 of 	 operating 	 risk;
 	 	 It 	 pr ovides 	 a 	 long 	 term 	 framework 	 which 	 has 	 embedded 	 flexibility 	 between 	 investment 	 and 	 cash 	 and 	 takes 	 into 	 account 	 the 	 cyclical 	 natur e 	 of	
the 	 pr operty 	 market;
 	 It 	 allows 	 Berkeley 	 to 	 operate 	 at 	 its 	 natural 	 size;
 	 The 	 model 	 pr ovides 	 a 	 performance 	 str etch 	 r elative 	 to 	 the 	 sector;
 	 It 	 supports 	 an 	 added 	 value 	 model 	 which 	 the 	 Boar d 	 believes 	 delivers 	 best 	 r eturns 	 to 	 shar eholders 	 over 	 the 	 long 	 term; 	 and
 	 Berkeley 	 can 	 generate 	 the 	 r eturns 	 without 	 intr oducing 	 unnecessary 	 financial 	 risk 	 in 	 a 	 cyclical 	 market.

KEY ELEMENTS OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY
The objective of Berkeley' s remuneration policy is to encourage, reward and retain the current Executives and ensure their actions are aligned with 
the Company' s strategy. The core philosophies of the policy are:
Fixed remuneration
The Committee sets salaries for the Executive Directors based on their experience, role, individual and corporate performance. Salaries on 
appointment to the Board are set at a lower quartile level of the comparator group which, based on appropriate levels of individual and corporate 
performance, will be increased with experience gained over time. 
Annual performance related pay
The Committee believes that shareholders' interests are best served by remuneration packages that have a large emphasis on 
performance-related pay which encourage the Executives to focus on delivering the business strategy. 
The chart below summarises the relative importance of the various components of annual remuneration for each Executive Director for 2012/13, 
illustrating that the majority of this remuneration is performance related:
 
The Committee is responsible for determining the performance measures, annual performance targets and bonus awards under the Annual 
Bonus Plan.
The specific performance measures under the Annual Bonus Plan, being a return based measure (Return on Equity) and a value based measure 
(Land Bank Growth) ensure that there is a balance between incentivising the Executives to provide a sustainable ongoing level of return to 
shareholders whilst ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Company, thereby creating long-term shareholder value.
The 	 performance 	 tar gets 	 a re 	 set 	 on 	 an 	 annual 	 basis 	 taking 	 into 	 account 	 the 	 above 	 considerations 	 and 	 r eflecting 	 an 	 appr opriate 	 level 	 of 	 risk.	
Long-term sustainable performance
The long-term incentives which extend to 2021 have been designed to lock-in the Executive team for a far longer period than is typical in most 
publicly listed companies. This helps to ensure that the Executive team are focused on generating long-term sustainable value for shareholders, 
not just on meeting short term performance targets.

GOVERNANCE
The Company' s long term incentive plans are designed to align the interests of shareholders and the Executive Directors over the long term. They 
are summarised below:
2009 LTIP
This was approved by over 85% of shareholders at an EGM in April 2009, and incorporates two parts:
a.  Part A - replacing the balance of the shares originally awarded under the previous 2004(b) LTIP , exercisable on 31 January 2014 subject to 
continued employment with the Company and an exercise price of  2.85 per share
b.  Part B - requiring maintaining a minimum net asset per share of  5.94 over a six year period, vesting in two equal tranches on 15 April 2015 and 
2016 with an exercise price of  8.25 per share
2011 LTIP
This is a ten year plan introduced in September 2011, and amended at the 2012 Annual General Meeting, to support the Company' s long term 
plan to return  1.7 billion to shareholders, representing 183% of the Net Assets per Share at 30 April 2011 ( 7.09/share), through a combination of 
dividends ( 13 per share) and share buybacks, by September 2021. This plan was approved by over 91% of shareholders at the 2011 Annual 
General Meeting and the amendment approved by over 92% of shareholders at the 2012 Annual General Meeting.
The plan aims to make significant returns to shareholders in cash over a sustained period, ensuring the Group remains at the right size and 
balances investment and returns to shareholders.
These plans are set out in more detail later in this report.
Risk adjustment
The Company' s reward arrangements should contain the following elements of risk adjustment, in line with best practice:
a. a focus on long-term sustainable performance - this is set out above. 
b.  the weighting of the reward package towards building substantial equity holdings which the Executive team are required to earn and hold over 
long periods:
 -  The final shares from the previous 2004(b) LTIP will not vest and sale restrictions be fully removed until 31 January 2014, ten years after 
awards were granted under the Plan.
 -  The 2009 LTIP provides longer than market standard vesting periods - for example options granted in 2009 under Part B of this Plan will vest 
50% on 15 April 2015 and the balance on 15 April 2016 subject to the Net Asset Value per share being a minimum of  5.94 at the first of 
these two dates.
c. the deferral of a significant proportion of annual incentive awards and clawback where there is a material deterioration in performance:
 -  The Annual Bonus Plan, whilst based on annual performance periods:
		  	 defers 	 50% 	 of 	 a 	 r olling 	 balance 	 each 	 year 	 in 	 notional 	 shar es 	 until 	 the 	 final 	 payments 	 a re 	 made 	 at 	 the 	 end 	 of 	 a 	 five 	 year 	 period; 	 and
		  		 ensur es 	 that 	 50% 	 of 	 these 	 r olling 	 balances 	 a re 	 at 	 material 	 risk 	 each 	 year 	 due 	 to 	 forfeitur e 	 if 	 minimum 	 thr eshold 	 levels 	 of 	 performance 	 set 	 in	
each year are not achieved.
d. no reward for failure:
 -  Under the 2011 LTIP all options lapse, no shares vest and the LTIP terminates on 1 October 2015 if  568.7 million has not been distributed to 
shareholders by 30 September 2015.
Substantial equity holdings
In order to align the interests of Executives and shareholders, the reward strategy is designed so that, provided performance is delivered, the 
Executive team become material (in relation to their overall compensation) shareholders in the Company.
The current shareholdings of the Executive Directors as a percentage of salary, based on the share price at 30 April 2013, are set out on page 71 of 
this report.
REMUNERATION REVIEW
The Committee reviews on an annual basis whether its remuneration policy remains appropriate for the relevant financial year. Factors taken into 
account by the Committee include:
 	 market 	 conditions 	 af fecting 	 the 	 Company;
 	 the 	 r ecruitment 	 market 	 in 	 the 	 Company' s 	 sector , 	 other 	 comparable 	 companies 	 and 	 the 	 FTSE 	 250;
 	 aligning 	 r emuneration 	 to 	 the 	 corporate 	 strategy 	 and 	 delivering 	 value 	 to 	 shar eholders 	 by 	 encouraging 	 long-term 	 sustainable 	 performance;
 	 changing 	 market 	 practice; 	 and
 	 changing 	 views 	 of 	 institutional 	 shar eholders 	 and 	 their 	 r epr esentative 	 bodies 	 and 	 Corporate 	 Governance 	 best 	 practice.

REMUNERATION REPORT
There have been no changes to the policy following the review in the year, with the only changes to individual remuneration being in respect of 
salaries as set below.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
Composition and role
At 30 April 2013, the Committee comprised of three Independent Non-executive Directors, Alan Coppin (Chairman), Sir John Armitt and Glyn 
Barker. Glyn Barker was appointed to the Committee on 13 June 2012 and David Howell retired from the Committee on the same date. Glyn 
Barker became Chairman of the Committee on 14 June 2013.
During the year the Committee met on two occasions and there were no absences. 
The 	 members 	 of 	 the 	 Committee 	 have 	 no 	 personal 	 financial 	 inter est, 	 other 	 than 	 as 	 shar eholders, 	 in 	 matters 	 to 	 be 	 decided, 	 no 	 potential 	 conflicts 	 of	
interest arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
The 	 Committee 	 is 	 able 	 to 	 seek 	 independent 	 advice 	 at 	 the 	 expense 	 of 	 the 	 Company; 	 no 	 advice 	 has 	 been 	 sought 	 by 	 the 	 Committee 	 during 	 the 	
year under review.
In determining the Executive Directors' remuneration for the year, the Committee consulted with the Group Chairman, T ony Pidgley, the Group 
Managing Director, Rob Perrins and the Group Finance Director, Nick Simpkin. No Director played a part in any discussion about his own 
remuneration. In addition, the Committee had access to information on executive reward provided to the Board by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , 
who acquired Halliwell Consulting, the previous advisers, in December 2008 and who have extensive knowledge of the Group and its structure.
The Executive Directors hold no external appointments.
The key responsibilities of the Committee are to:
 	 	 determine 	 and 	 agr ee 	 with 	 the 	 Boar d 	 the 	 br oad 	 policy 	 for 	 the 	 r emuneration 	 of 	 the 	 Executive 	 Dir ectors. 	 This 	 includes 	 salary , 	 annual 	 bonus 	 	
plans, 	 shar e 	 options, 	 other 	 shar e 	 based 	 incentives 	 and 	 pensions;
 	 	 determine 	 the 	 performance 	 tar gets 	 for 	 the 	 Annual 	 Bonus 	 Plan 	 operated 	 by 	 the 	 company 	 and 	 appr ove 	 the 	 total 	 annual 	 payments 	 made 	 	 under 	
this 	 plan;
 	 determine 	 all 	 shar e 	 incentive 	 plans 	 for 	 appr oval 	 by 	 the 	 Boar d 	 and 	 shar eholders;
 	 take 	 into 	 account 	 the 	 views 	 of 	 shar eholders 	 when 	 determining 	 plans 	 under 	 the 	 r emuneration 	 policy;

The Committee has formal terms of reference which describes its full remit. This can be downloaded from the section dealing with Investor 
Relations on the Berkeley website (www.berkeleygroup.co.uk).
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2012/13 AND 2013/14
The policy is to set the main elements of the Executive Directors' remuneration package against the following quartiles in the Company' s 
comparator group:
Base salary Annual bonus Pension Benefits in kind Share incentives
Experience and Role  Upper decile  Lower quartile  Market practice Upper decile
For the purposes of benchmarking remuneration the Committee used the following comparator group of companies in the year ended 30 April 
2013:
Company name
Amec PLC Bellway PLC Marshalls PLC Taylor Wimpey PLC
Balfour Beatty PLC Bovis Homes Group PLC Persimmon PLC Travis Perkins PLC
Barratt Developments PLC Carillion PLC Redrow PLC
The Committee also considers the remuneration in the FTSE 250 as an additional benchmark to the main comparator group set out above due to 
its relatively small number of constituent companies.

ELEMENTS OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
BASIC SALARY
The Committee has historically set the salary of the Chairman, T ony Pidgley, at the upper decile against the Company' s comparator group 
r eflecting 	 the 	 Committee' s 	 view 	 that 	 he 	 is 	 one 	 of 	 the 	 most 	 experienced 	 individuals 	 within 	 the 	 sector 	 and 	 that 	 he 	 possesses 	 unique 	 experience	
within the industry. 
The Committee has taken account of the following factors in setting individual salary levels:
 	 the 	 individual 	 Executive 	 Dir ector' s 	 experience 	 and 	 r esponsibilities;
 	 	 the 	 levels 	 of 	 base 	 salary 	 for 	 similar 	 positions 	 with 	 comparable 	 status, 	 r esponsibility 	 and 	 skills 	 in 	 or ganisations 	 of 	 br oadly 	 similar 	 size 	 and 	 	
complexity , 	 in 	 particular 	 those 	 companies 	 within 	 the 	 comparator 	 gr oup, 	 other 	 comparable 	 companies 	 and 	 the 	 FTSE 	 250;
 	 the 	 performance 	 of 	 the 	 individual 	 Executive 	 Dir ector 	 and 	 the 	 Gr oup; 	 and
 	 the 	 pay 	 and 	 conditions 	 thr oughout 	 the 	 Gr oup.
On appointment to the Board and promotion, the Committee sets salaries at a lower quartile level which, based on appropriate levels of 
individual and corporate performance, will be increased with experience gained over time. 
The salaries for 2013/14 are set out below:

ANNUAL PERFORMANCE-RELATED BONUS
The Berkeley Group Holdings plc Bonus Plan 
Overview of the Bonus Plan
 	 At 	 the 	 beginning 	 of 	 the 	 plan 	 period 	 of 	 five 	 financial 	 years, 	 participants 	 will 	 have 	 a 	 plan 	 account 	 to 	 which 	 Company 	 contributions 	 
 will be made.
 	 No 	 Company 	 contribution 	 will 	 be 	 made 	 to 	 a 	 participant' s 	 plan 	 account 	 unless 	 the 	 annual 	 performance 	 criteria 	 a re 	 met.
 	 The 	 Company 	 contribution 	 will 	 be 	 set 	 annually 	 as 	 a 	 per centage 	 of 	 salary 	 for 	 each 	 Executive.
 	 	 Ther e 	 will 	 be 	 two 	 types 	 of 	 performance 	 condition, 	 Gr oup 	 and 	 Divisional. 	 The 	 Gr oup 	 performance 	 condition 	 will 	 be 	 a 	 matrix 	 of 	 Return 	 on	 
Equity (ROE ) and Land Bank Growth. The Divisional performance condition will be based upon Divisional Profit before T ax (PBT ).
 	 Having 	 r egar d 	 to 	 the 	 strategy 	 of 	 the 	 Company , 	 the 	 Committee 	 will 	 set:
	- 	 	 the 	 performance 	 levels 	 (including 	 minimum 	 performance 	 thr esholds) 	 for 	 the 	 performance 	 conditions 	 for 	 each 	 plan 	 year; 	 and
 -  the maximum annual Company contribution for each participant for the plan year.
 	 	 These 	 criteria 	 will 	 be 	 disclosed 	 in 	 full 	 in 	 the 	 r elevant 	 Committee 	 r eport 	 along 	 with 	 the 	 annual 	 contributions 	 earned 	 and 	 deferr ed 	 balances	 
for each participant.
 	 	 Wher e 	 the 	 minimum 	 thr eshold 	 performance 	 criteria 	 on 	 both 	 measur es 	 a re 	 not 	 achieved, 	 50% 	 of 	 the 	 deferr ed 	 balance 	 in 	 a 	 participant' s 	 plan	
account will be forfeited.
 	 	 Participants 	 will 	 be 	 entitled 	 to 	 an 	 annual 	 payment 	 of 	 50% 	 of 	 their 	 plan 	 account 	 at 	 the 	 end 	 of 	 each 	 financial 	 year . 	 All 	 balances 	 will 	 be 	 
deferred in shares or notional shares. At the end of the five year plan period 100% of the balance of participants' accounts will be paid.
Key features of the Bonus Plan
The Committee designed the Bonus Plan based on the following rationale:
Two targets - the balance between operating a return based measure (ROE ) and a value based measure (Land Bank Growth ) should ensure 
that the Executives are incentivised to provide a sustainable ongoing level of return to shareholders whilst ensuring the long-term sustainability of 
the Company, as follows:
 	 	 the 	 Bonus 	 Plan 	 incentivises 	 the 	 delivery 	 of 	 incr eased 	 pr ofits 	 in 	 or der 	 to 	 achieve 	 ROE 	 at 	 the 	 same 	 time 	 as 	 gr owing 	 the 	 land 	 bank. 	 It 	 should 	 be	
noted that the ROE will be set from a challenging base as the Company has not needed to take any land write downs as is the case with the 
majority 	 of 	 its 	 competitors;
 	 	 ROE 	 is 	 a 	 compound 	 measur e 	 and 	 ther efor e 	 if 	 shar eholder 	 funds 	 a re 	 r einvested 	 and 	 not 	 paid 	 as 	 dividends, 	 earnings 	 gr owth 	 will 	 be 	
compounded 	 to 	 achieve 	 the 	 tar gets;
 	 	 the 	 fact 	 that 	 the 	 Bonus 	 Plan 	 tar gets 	 also 	 include 	 gr owth 	 in 	 the 	 land 	 bank 	 value, 	 means 	 that 	 Executives 	 a re 	 encouraged 	 to 	 acquir e 	 land 	 in 	 the	
curr ent 	 market 	 on 	 favourable 	 terms 	 as 	 well 	 as 	 maximise 	 sustainable 	 pr ofit 	 gr owth; 	 and
 	 	 ROE 	 as 	 a 	 measur e 	 highlights 	 the 	 inefficiency 	 of 	 r etaining 	 surplus 	 cash 	 on 	 the 	 balance 	 sheet. 	 In 	 or der 	 to 	 deliver 	 the 	 tar geted 	 level 	 of 	 r eturns, 	 this	
will encourage the Company to invest or return cash to shareholders.
Level of targets - the Committee incentivises the Executives to achieve a good level of returns to shareholders whilst ensuring the long-term 
sustainability of the Company. Therefore the targets set have to take into account an appropriate level of risk. The Bonus Plan allows a close 
tailoring by the Committee of the performance conditions to the budget and performance of the Company for each financial year.
At the outset of the Plan, the Committee set the annual performance requirements targeting an average ROE of 12.5% p.a. and average Land 
Bank Growth of 10% p.a. over the full five years of the plan, which were considered challenging and stretching targets at that time, effectively 
doubling pre tax profits and growing the land bank gross margin to  3 billion over this period. 
Over 	 the 	 course 	 of 	 the 	 Plan 	 ther e 	 is 	 likely 	 to 	 be 	 annual 	 variability 	 in 	 the 	 performance 	 r equir ements 	 actually 	 set 	 to 	 r eflect 	 the 	 envir onment 	 at 	 the	
time (see performance targets for 2012/13 and 2013/14 operation of the plan set out later in this report). These are reviewed each year by the 
Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the Company, so that they continue to remain 
challenging and fully aligned to the strategy of the Group.
The maximum performance targets set and actual performance over the first three years of the plan are set out below:
  Return on Equity Land Bank growth
  Target Actual  Target Actual
2010/11  13.5% 15.3%  10.0% 13.1%
2011/12  16.5% 21.2%  8.0% 12.0%
2012/13  18.5% 22.4%  10.0% 10.5%
In respect of the Return on Equity target, if Berkeley had performed at the median of its competitors for these years, then no bonuses would have 
been awarded to the Executive Directors.

Risk adjustment - there is a risk adjustment mechanism built into the operation of the Bonus Plan with a claw back of contributions if the 
threshold levels of ROE and Land Bank Growth are not met for any financial year during the five years of operation of the Bonus Plan. This 
adjustment mechanism ensures:
 	 	 performance 	 must 	 be 	 maintained 	 over 	 the 	 five 	 years 	 of 	 operation 	 of 	 the 	 Bonus 	 Plan 	 or 	 the 	 value 	 in 	 the 	 participant' s 	 plan 	 account 	 will 	 not 	
incr ease; 	 and
 	 	 if 	 ther e 	 is 	 a 	 material 	 deterioration 	 in 	 performance 	 ther e 	 is 	 a 	 claw 	 back 	 of 	 50% 	 of 	 the 	 balance 	 of 	 the 	 participant' s 	 account.	
Operation of the Bonus Plan for the year ended 30 April 2013
The bonus payable to each of the Group Chairman, Group Managing Director and Group Finance Director is determined by reference to the 
Group performance condition. For the Divisional Directors, 50% of the potential bonus payable is determined by reference to the Group 
performance condition and 50% by reference to the Divisional PBT performance condition.

1  The matrix shows the percentage of each of the performance requirements for a given level of performance and the corresponding percentage of the targeted 
maximum annual bonus potential earned for 2012/13.
2 There will be straight line bonus vesting between points.
3  If the minimum threshold levels for either are not met, no contribution is made to the Bonus Plan account. If the minimum threshold levels of performance are 
not met for both performance conditions, 50% of the participant's plan account will be forfeited. Structuring the performance conditions in this way will ensure 
consistent levels of ROE at the same time as the Group invests and adds value to the land bank.
4 ROE is defined as profit before tax divided by average shareholders' funds.
5  Land Bank Growth is defined as the annual percentage increase in the development margin in the land bank. This is the anticipated future gross margin to be 
earned from plots controlled and included in the Group's land bank. To be included in the land bank, management must have reasonable certainty that the 
plots will come forward for development, either benefiting from a planning consent or being on land zoned for development. For the avoidance of doubt, the 
land bank excludes plots subject to strategic land options. Calculated plot by plot, the development margin is measured on a consistent basis according to 
prevailing sales prices for revenue, historic cost for costs already incurred and prevailing prices for costs still to be incurred. It is separately disclosed within the 
annual report. Each year the land bank gross margin is reduced naturally by the amount of gross margin sold in the year. Therefore, zero % growth in the land 
bank means that replacement matches usage.

LONG TERM REMUNERATION
This section of the report sets out the share incentives for the year ended 30 April 2013.
On 15 April 2009, at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company, over 85% of shareholders approved the introduction of The Berkeley 
Group Holdings plc 2009 Long-T erm Incentive Plan, which incorporated and replaced Element 2 of The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004(b) 
Long-T erm Incentive Plan (the 2004(b) LTIP ) and the previously approved 2007 LTIP , as set out below.
2009 LTIP PART A
The balance of the shares originally awarded under the 2004(b) LTIP (i.e. 3/12 of the shares), totalling 5,330,340 shares, were replaced by options 
with an exercise price of  3 per share granted under the 2009 LTIP . This new option is identified as Part A of the 2009 LTIP . These options were 
awarded on 29 June 2009, at which time the Element 2 awards under the 2004(b) LTIP were surrendered. 
4,441,950 options are currently outstanding, which will become exercisable on 31 January 2014 subject to the relevant Executive' s continued 
employment with the Company.

GOVERNANCE
2009 LTIP PART B
Following shareholder approval on 15 April 2009, a maximum of 7,100,000 shares were capable of being granted under Part B of the 2009 LTIP . 
The grants under Part B of the 2009 LTIP are market priced options which will vest subject to:
 	 continued 	 employment 	 to 	 the 	 r elevant 	 vesting 	 date; 	 and
 	 the 	 satisfaction 	 of 	 the 	 underpin 	 condition 	 that 	 Net 	 Assets 	 Per 	 Shar e 	 a re 	 at 	 least 	  5.94 	 at 	 15 	 April 	 2015.

	- 	 	 50% 	 on 	 15 	 April 	 2015; 	 and
 -  50% on 15 April 2016.
A total of 6,120,000 options are outstanding.
Shareholder approval was received at the 2011 AGM to amend the rules of the 2009 LTIP (covering both Part A and Part B) so that the terms of 
existing options granted can be adjusted in the event of the payment of a cash dividend or dividend in specie. This provides that where such a 
dividend is paid the adjustment will be a reduction in the exercise price of an option by the amount or value of the dividend provided that the 
exercise price can never be less than zero and a reduction will only be made to the exercise price of an option that is not then capable of exercise.
2011 LTIP
The Company announced in June 2011 as part of a strategic review of the business a long term plan to return approximately  1.7 billion to 
shareholders over the next 10 years. A new long term remuneration plan was proposed to support this strategy, the 2011 Long T erm Incentive 
Plan (2011 LTIP ), which was approved by over 91% of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in September 2011.
The rules of the plan were subsequently amended, and approved by over 92% of shareholders at the 2012 Annual General Meeting, to allow the 
returns to be made through a combination of dividends ( 13 per share) and share buy backs (distributions ). The cumulative distributions 
required by the plan on or before the relative milestone dates are set out below:
     Cumulative Distributions
30 September 2015    568.7m
30 September 2018    1,136.1m

The key features of the 2011 LTIP are:
 	 	 if 	 the 	 Company 	 r eturns 	  1.7 	 billion 	 to 	 shar eholders 	 over 	 a 	 ten 	 year 	 period 	 via 	 a 	 series 	 of 	 dividend 	 payments 	 ( 13 	 per 	 shar e) 	 and 	 shar e 	 buy 	 backs

The following table sets out the cumulative distributions, the relevant dates and the consequences of failing to deliver these distributions by these 
relevant dates:
Required date Cumulative 
dividend  
(on or before 
required date)
Consequences of failing to make the cumulative dividend payments on or before the  
required date
30 September 2015  568.7m Options lapse, no shares vest and 2011 LTIP terminates on 1 October 2015.
30 September 2018  1,136.1m Where the cumulative distributions on or before 30 September 2018 is less than  1,136.1m, the following 
process determines the number of shares vesting:-
1  The number of shares capable of vesting is calculated on the level of dividend paid and capable of being 
paid as at 30 September 2018. 
2  The exercise price of the shares capable of vesting is set by reducing the original exercise price of  13 by 
the level of cumulative dividend actually paid on or before 30 September 2021.
3  No shares will vest until the end of the 2011 LTIP period on 30 September 2021 subject to the 
participant's continued employment at this date.
For example:-
A participant is granted an award over 3 million shares
On 30 September 2018 it is determined that an additional  3 per share is capable of being paid as well as 
the actual payments made on or before 30 September 2015 of  4.34; giving a total of  7.34.
Therefore the number of shares capable of vesting on 30 September 2021 is as follows:-
3 million shares x  7.34 = 1,693,846 shares 
                               13
with an exercise price initially per share of  8.66 ( 13 -  4.34).
If, however, the actual dividend payments made on or before 30 September 2021 exceed  4.34 the exercise 
price will be reduced to  13 minus the actual level of dividends paid. For example if the actual dividend 
paid was  10 the exercise price would reduce to  3 ( 13 -  10). The number of shares capable of vesting 
would, however, remain unchanged with the balance incapable of vesting having lapsed on 1 October 2018.
30 September 2021  1,703.6m The process is the same as above with the relevant date being 30 September 2021.
 1,703.6m paid in 
full prior to 30 
September 2021 
(including  13/share 
in dividends)
 1,703.6m In circumstances where  1,703.6m of cumulative distributions (including  13/share in 
dividends) are made prior to 30 September 2021 awards shall vest in full. 
Participants will be able to exercise their awards of options from the date this cumulative 
target is met and may also sell any shares necessary to pay their tax liability on exercise.
In respect of the balance of their shares participants shall only be able to sell a maximum of 
10% p.a. of this balance until 30 September 2021 at which date the sale restrictions shall 
lapse.
OTHER SENIOR EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY
The Company' s business comprises of a number of operating Divisions. The Committee in conjunction with the Board has, therefore, 
implemented both annual and longer term cash based compensation arrangements for these other senior employees of the Company linked to 
the performance of the relevant Division for which they work. Some elements of the cash bonus plans are annual while other elements are 
deferred to ensure long-term consistent delivery by each Division. The Committee, in line with best practice, continually reviews with the Board 
the policy behind the compensation plans at this level in the Company to ensure they remain appropriate to the market and the Company' s 
current circumstances. It is the view of both the Committee and the Board as a whole that these arrangements are very effective at ensuring the 
delivery of Divisional performance for which these senior employees are responsible. Both the Committee and the Board believe that having 
senior employees focused on the delivery of Divisional results is an excellent way of driving shareholder value. 
A number of senior employees of the Company have also been granted awards under the 2009 LTIP Part B. 
SHAREHOLDING REQUIREMENT
The Company has a shareholding requirement for both Executive and Non-executive Directors and these requirements and the actual 
shareholdings of the Executive and Non-executive Directors as at 30 April 2013 are set out in the following tables:

DILUTION
The 2009 LTIP and 2011 LTIP were special arrangements, approved by shareholders at the EGM in April 2009 and AGM in September 2011 
respectively.
In considering dilution under the 2011 LTIP the Committee took account of the long term nature of the plan which extends beyond the length of 
normal incentive plans. 
In addition, the Committee took into account the significant priority returns of  1.7 billion ( 13 per share), representing 183% of Net Assets at 30 
April 2011, that shareholders will receive from the plan over this 10 year period, with the actual value of the awards to the Executive Directors 
based on the ongoing value of the Group following this significant realisation of current value to the existing shareholders.
Historically the Company has operated all its share plans within the ABI dilution limits. There has been no dilution other than under these special 
arrangements for the purposes of the ABI dilution limits in the year ended 30 April 2013. 
OTHER REMUNERATION MATTERS 
All Employee Share Plans 
The Company has regularly consulted widely with the management and individuals in its operating Divisions on whether it was appropriate to 
introduce all employee share plans. The consensus view remains that employees preferred the opportunity of receiving annual cash bonuses 
based on the performance of their respective Divisions rather than participate in a Group based all employee share plan. The Board, therefore, 
does not believe it is in shareholders' interests to incur the income statement and dilutive cost of share arrangements which would not have the 
desired effect on employees. Accordingly the Company will continue to operate appropriate annual bonus arrangements in all of its Divisions.
Non-executive Directors' Fees 
All Non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by the 
Articles of Association. The following table sets out the fee rates for the Non-executive Directors in the year ended 30 April 2013 and those rates 
which will apply in the year ending 30 April 2014:

The Board reviews the fees of the Non-executive Directors annually taking into account the following factors:
 	 	 the 	 workload 	 and 	 level 	 of 	 r esponsibility 	 of 	 the 	 Non-executive 	 Dir ectors 	 under 	 the 	 changing 	 corporate 	 governance 	 expectations 	 of

Non-executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Company' s share incentive plans or performance based plans and are not eligible to join 
the Company' s pension scheme.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' CONTRACTS 
The policy on termination is that the Company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations. The only event on the occurrence of 
which 	 the 	 Company 	 is 	 potentially 	 liable 	 to 	 make 	 a 	 payment 	 to 	 any 	 of 	 the 	 Executive 	 Dir ectors 	 is 	 on 	 cessation 	 of 	 employment; 	 with 	 the 	 maximum 	
payment being 12 months salary. No payment is due on either a Company takeover or in the event of liquidation. In addition, Executive Directors 
will be expected to mitigate their loss. Further, the Committee ensures that there have been no unjustified payments for failure. None of the 
Executive Directors' contracts provides for liquidated damages. There are no special provisions contained in any of the Executive Directors' 
contracts which provide for longer periods of notice on a change of control of the Company. Further, there are no special provisions providing for 
additional compensation on an Executive Director' s cessation of employment with the Company.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH 
As required by the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Account and Reports) Regulations 2008, the graph below shows the 
Company' s performance, measured by total shareholder return (TSR ), compared with the performance of the FTSE250, the FTSE All Share and 
the Company' s remuneration comparator group (as set out on page 64). The Company considers these the most relevant indices for total 
shareholder return disclosure required under these Regulations.
Total shareholder return from 30 April 2008 (%)
(1)  Total shareholder return (TSR ) is a measure showing the return on investing in one share of the Company over the measurement period (the return is the value

Pidgley and Rob Perrins received payments in lieu of pension at 17% of base salary and Karl Whiteman at 15% of base salary.
