 Remuneration Report
The Berkeley Group plc Annual Report 2003   23
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the Company's broad policy for executive remuneration and the terms of
employment and remuneration of Executive Directors. It consists exclusively of the independent Non-executive Directors as listed on 
pages 18 and 19. They are Mrs V M Mitchell (Chairman), Mr H A Palmer and Mr F Wellings. Mrs V M Mitchell became Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee on 11 June 2003 following the resignation from the Main Board of Mr D S Sach, the previous Chairman. In fulfilling 
its responsibilities, the Remuneration Committee has given full consideration to Section B of the principles of good governance annexed to the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the requirements of Statutory Instrument 2002/1986 - The Director's Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002 (the  new Regulations'). This report will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of the Company in accordance
with the new Regulations.
Remuneration policy
The Company's policy on Executive Directors' remuneration is to provide an appropriate package having regard to factors such as overall
responsibilities, individual and Group performance as well as market rates. In setting Executive Directors' remuneration, the Remuneration
Committee has had particular regard to the principle that remuneration committees should provide packages needed to attract, retain and
motivate Directors of the quality required, but should avoid paying more than is necessary for this purpose. In the view of the Remuneration
Committee, this is to a great extent a subjective decision and one in which common sense plays a large part. However, as recommended 
in the best practice provisions, the Remuneration Committee has considered the issue of comparability and relative performance within the
industry sector.
During the year, Kepler Associates were appointed by the Remuneration Committee to assist in its consideration of all matters relating to
Executive Directors' remuneration. The Remuneration Committee also consulted with the Group Chairman and Group Managing Director.
In constructing and reviewing remuneration packages for Executive Directors, the emphasis is on linking pay to performance through a
combination of fixed (salary and benefits) and performance related elements (performance bonuses and long term incentives) with a weighting
towards performance. The performance related elements are determined by reference to the operating performance of the Group or specific
relevant division in respect of Group Main Board members with divisional responsibilities.
Base salary
Base salary is designed to reflect individual Executive Directors' responsibilities, experience, contribution and market value. To determine 
market competitive salaries both published information on, and surveys comparing public companies of a similar size and from a similar sector
are considered.
Performance bonus
Bonus levels for Executive Directors are chiefly related to the achievement of pre-agreed annual profit before tax targets, determined by the
Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each financial year. Bonuses for Messrs Lewis, Pidgley and Perrins are predominantly linked to
Group profits. Messrs Carey, Farrow, Fry and Hutchinson receive bonuses generally linked to the performance of the divisions for which they 
are responsible. In setting the targets, the Remuneration Committee takes into account the Group's overall strategy and market positioning.
Profit before tax is used as the basis for setting performance targets as it reflects, in the view of the Remuneration Committee, the best measure
of organic growth and operational performance, also having regard to the cost of financing those operations. It is also easily measured by
reference to audited results.
Long-term incentives
(a) The Long Term Incentive Plan
The principal form of long term incentive, eligible to Executive Directors, is through the Berkeley Group Long Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP' or the
 Plan'). The Plan is intended to deliver rewards to a participant only if there has been strong underlying performance in the Group or, in the case
of Executive Directors with specific divisional responsibility, the division for which those Directors are responsible.
Under the LTIP, which is administered by a special committee comprising the members of the Remuneration Committee, individuals may be
granted an award annually, the vesting of which is subject to the attainment of pre-determined performance targets measured over a three-year
period. Awards are intended to deliver a pre-determined cash value and a number of shares, each worth at the outset 50% of the value of the
total annual award. The shares element is fixed by reference to the market value of the Company's shares at the date of grant. In general,
participants will not be granted awards under the LTIP and any of the Executive Share Option Schemes in the same year, unless exceptional
circumstances prevail. 24 The Berkeley Group plc Annual Report 2003
Remuneration Report continued
The maximum value to be delivered under an award (based on the share price at the date of grant) is 200% of an individual's annual salary
(excluding bonuses and all other benefits) as at the date of grant. In practice, it is envisaged that awards above 100% of an individual's annual
salary (excluding bonuses and all other benefits) will be made only to a limited number of individuals.
The cash element is payable following the third anniversary of the date of grant of the award provided the performance targets has been met. 
The participant is normally only entitled to the share element following the fourth anniversary from the date of grant of the award, by which time
the value of the underlying shares will have increased or decreased in line with the Company's share price performance over the period since 
the date of grant. Performance under the LTIP is measured according to the level of audited cumulative pre-tax profits of the division or Group
company in which the participant is employed over the relevant period. Achievement is determined on an  all or nothing' basis over a period of
three years with no opportunity for re-testing. For awards under the LTIP to vest, the audited net assets of each division or Group company, after
taking account of changes in share capital and dividend distributions, must also have increased by at least a cumulative rate of 10% per annum
since the base year.
For the reasons stated previously, profit before tax is believed to be the most appropriate target against which to measure executive performance.
By introducing a net asset criteria as an additional target for the LTIP, participants must have regard to the long-term condition of the business. 
Details of awards made under the LTIP are provided in the table on page 28 of this report.
(b) The Long Term Executive Incentive Scheme
Prior to the establishment of the LTIP , the Company had established The Berkeley Group plc Long Term Executive Incentive Scheme (the
 Scheme') 1995 and 1996; the final awards to Directors being made in respect of the 1996 Scheme on 1 May 1996. These schemes entitled
eligible participants to receive an award in the provisional allocation of rights to Company shares in each of the five years from commencement.
To receive awards, relevant performance targets based upon earnings per share growth, increase in net asset value and share price performance
for that year needed to be satisfied.
Participants remaining in employment received the provisionally allocated shares after a period of approximately six years from commencement 
of their participation in the Scheme. In addition, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, a final cash sum may be payable to each
participant based on the achievement of similar performance targets over the period of five years.
During the year ended 30 April 2003, two Directors received their share allocation in respect of the 1996 Scheme, having completed their
participation therein on 30 April 2001 (see page 26). At 30 April 2003, one senior manager remained entitled to shares under the 1996 Scheme.
(c) Executive Share Option Scheme
The Remuneration Committee believes that executive option schemes also have an important part to play in motivating senior executives. 
Two new plans were introduced in 2000 to replace the existing approved and unapproved schemes. The SAYE scheme remains in place.
Under the option plans, individuals may be granted options annually over shares worth up to 100% of annual salary (excluding bonuses and all
other benefits). The Remuneration Committee has discretion to vary this amount in exceptional circumstances, in which case the limit is 200% of
annual salary (excluding bonuses and all other benefits). Exercise of any option is conditional upon meeting defined performance targets based 
on the increase in earnings per Ordinary Share over a three-year period. In general, participants will not be granted awards under the LTIP and
any of the Executive Share Option Schemes in the same year, unless exceptional circumstances prevail.
On 30 April 2003, following the conclusion of a review of the Group's financial strategy and Executive Incentive arrangements, a grant of options
under the Executive Share Option Schemes was made to Mr A W Pidgley, details of which are shown on page 29. The options granted had a
value of 200% of his annual salary and the number of shares granted under this special option was calculated using an average three-month
share price. The vesting of the options will be based on share price growth rather than the EPS based conditions mentioned above. The options
will vest in full only if the Company's share price rises by at least 50% within a three to five-year period (based on the three-month average share
price set on the date of grant). The number of shares vesting will be calculated on a sliding scale for share price growth between 20% and 50%.
At 20% growth, 10% of the options vest. Below 20%, no options vest. If the performance condition has not been met within five years the
options will lapse. It is intended that Mr A W Pidgley can benefit from similar awards in the future with performance targets based on a measure of
share price growth. The Berkeley Group plc Annual Report 2003   25
Performance graph
The line graph below shows the total shareholder return ( TSR') over the last five years against the FTSE All Share Index. The FTSE All Share
Index has been chosen as a comparator as it represents a broad range of UK quoted companies.
Pension and other benefits
The Executive Directors are all members of one or more of the following pension schemes in operation within the Group, namely The Berkeley
Group Staff Benefits Plan, The Berkeley Homes Executive Pension Plan and The St George PLC Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme. 
No element other than basic salary is pensionable.
As shown in the table on page 27, three (2002: three) Directors have benefits accruing to them under a defined contribution scheme and 
five (2002: five) have benefits accruing to them under a defined benefit scheme. Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in 
these schemes.
Other benefits in kind, such as healthcare and fully expensed company cars, are provided in accordance with Company policy for such benefits,
which are aligned to market practice.
Remuneration of Non-executive Directors
Remuneration for the Company's Non-executive Directors is determined by the Group Main Board and reviewed annually with advice from
external consultants as deemed necessary. It does not include any performance related element. All non-executives have service contracts
renewable annually on 1 May.
Directors' service contracts
All Executive Directors are employed on service contracts under which the Company is required to give 12 months' notice of termination with 
the Executive Directors also required to give 12 months' notice. None of these service contracts contain provisions for any predetermined
compensation on termination.

The Remuneration Committee has determined that the performance targets for the 2000 awards have been met. Accordingly, participants will receive the cash
element of these awards during 2003 and the share element 12 months later, assuming they remain in the employment of the Group.
Mr A W Pidgley was initially omitted from the 2000 LTIP awards but the Remuneration Committee has determined that he shall receive award payments in respect
of such performance as if he had received an award in 2000.
