Remuneration Committee Report
At the EGM held on 24 February 2004 shareholders approved a new remuneration policy for the Company's Executive Directors, the key features of
which are as follows:
  a salary freeze for three years for the Executive Directors (1 May 2003 to 30 April 2006);
  a change to the structure and method of payment of bonuses;
  the introduction of a new Long Term Incentive Plan, The Berkeley Group plc 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  2004 LTIP'); and
  the introduction of a new all employee share incentive plan, The Berkeley Group plc 2004 Share Incentive Plan (the  2004 SIP').
The percentage of shareholdings voting who supported the new policy and the introduction of the 2004 LTIP were 94% and 92% respectively.
This policy was formulated by the Remuneration Committee in response to concerns raised by shareholders at the 2003 AGM and was only finalised after
extensive consultation with the Company's major shareholders and institutional shareholder bodies, such as the ABI, NAPF and PIRC. The Remuneration
Committee believed that the new policy with the emphasis on performance should encourage Executives to focus on delivering the business strategy
adopted at that time, thereby enhancing shareholder value as well as providing meaningful incentive to Executives. This report will be put to a second
advisory vote of the Company's shareholders in 2004 at the Annual General Meeting on 27 August 2004.
As announced on 25 June 2004, the Company has concluded a strategic review resulting in a proposed restructuring. The Board believes it is
appropriate in light of this proposed restructuring to review the new remuneration policy, approved by shareholders at the EGM on 24 February 2004, 
so that it aligns management's incentives with the achievement of the return of capital and maximising the value of the continuing business. 
The Remuneration Committee will consult fully with key shareholders on the proposed changes.
This report has been prepared in accordance with The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 ( the regulations'). The auditors are required to
report on the  auditable' part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the regulations). The report is, therefore, divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.

Remuneration Committee Report continued
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee of the Board comprises Mrs V M Mitchell (Chairman), Mr D Howell and Mr H A Palmer, all of whom are Non-executive
Directors and independent. Mrs V M Mitchell became Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on 11 June 2003 following the resignation from the 
Main Board of Mr D Sach, the previous Chairman. Mr D Howell was appointed to the Remuneration Committee on 24 February 2004. Mr F Wellings, a
Non-executive Director, was a member of the Remuneration Committee during the year until 5 December 2003. The Remuneration Committee members
have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross directorships
and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Remuneration Committee has formal written terms of reference with the full remit of the Committee role described. A copy of the terms of reference 
is available to shareholders by writing to the Company Secretary whose contact details are set out elsewhere in the Report & Accounts. During the year 
in question the Remuneration Committee formally met four times, with the sub-committee dealing with the design and introduction of the new executive
remuneration policy having approximately 30 meetings with other members of the Board and the Company's major shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee appointed and was advised during the year by Kepler Associates and Halliwell Consulting. No other services were provided
to the Company by Kepler Associates and Halliwell Consulting during the year. The current Remuneration Committee advisors are Halliwell Consulting, 
an independent executive compensation and share scheme consultancy.
In determining Executive Directors' remuneration for the year, the Remuneration Committee consulted with the Group Chairman, Mr R St J H Lewis, the
Group Finance Director, Mr R C Perrins and the Group Managing Director, Mr A W Pidgley. No Director played a part in any discussion about his own
remuneration.
The Board has reviewed the Group's compliance with the Combined Code ( the Code') on remuneration related matters. It is the opinion of the Board that
the Group complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the year, and the New Code by the end of the year.
Remuneration Policy Overview
Following the concerns raised by shareholders at the 2003 AGM, the Remuneration Committee conducted a full review of the remuneration policy. 
As part of this process, an extensive shareholder consultation process was carried out in order to ensure that the remuneration policy, as well as meeting
the Company's objectives was in line with shareholders' expectations. As a result of this process, a new remuneration policy has been approved by the
Company's shareholders. This report sets out details of Executive remuneration during the year and the ongoing remuneration policy.
The objective of the remuneration policy is to encourage, reward and retain the current Executives. The Remuneration Committee believes that
shareholders' interests are best served by remuneration packages having a large emphasis on performance-related pay. Emphasis on performance should
encourage Executives to focus on delivering the business strategy. It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that the new policy will provide
meaningful incentives to Executives and ensure that the appropriate balance between fixed and performance-related pay is maintained. The policy agreed
by shareholders at the EGM on 24 February 2004 was to set the main elements of the Executive Directors' remuneration package against the following
quartiles in the Company's comparator group:
For the purposes of benchmarking remuneration the Remuneration Committee uses the following comparator group of companies:

In addition, the life of the new LTIP and bonus framework is five years, requiring the Company to revert to shareholders for a formal approval at the end 
of this period for any future arrangements.
The charts below demonstrate the balance between fixed and variable performance based pay for each Executive Director for the year ended 
30 April 2004:
The main elements of these packages and the performance conditions are described below.
Elements of Executive Directors' Remuneration
Basic Salary
Policy: Upper Decile - Salary Freeze 1 May 2003-30 April 2006
Year Ended 30 April 2004
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the Executive Directors' salaries in May 2003 and provided the rises set out in the table below. The two rises of
note are to the Group Managing Director and the Group Finance Director. The Remuneration Committee used a wide range of benchmarks, FTSE 100,
Property Companies, Construction and Building Companies and House Builders when deciding on these rises. It was the view of the Remuneration
Committee at the time that the increase in salary for the Group Managing Director was required to ensure that he retained his comparative position and 
to draw a line under elements of his remuneration package which had been open for some time. The Remuneration Committee provided the rise to the
Group Finance Director based on their view of his performance and growth in capabilities over the period.
The Executives' current salaries are set at the upper decile compared to the comparator group. It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee that they
should remain at this level in line with the Committee's view that the Company has one of the most experienced Executive teams within the sector.

Remuneration Committee Report continued
Future Policy
The Remuneration Committee, with the rises in 2003, feels that it has reached its desired policy for Executive salary levels and is therefore implementing 
a salary freeze for the Executive team from 1 May 2003 to 30 April 2006 (three years). The next salary review date will be, in the normal course of events,
1 May 2006. It should be noted that in line with the Company's policy on salary reviews, the reviews on 1 May 2006 will not result in automatic salary
increases. It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to look to the bonus and share arrangements to reward Executives for their performance rather
than to increases in base salary.
The Remuneration Committee will retain the discretion to increase salary levels if Executives are promoted or on the occurrence of any unforeseen event
which materially affects the Company and/or the market in which it operates. In the event of such an unforeseen event the Remuneration Committee will
consult shareholders before adjusting salary levels.
When determining the salary of the Executive Directors the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration:
  the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, 
in particular those companies within the comparator group;
  the performance of the individual Executive Director;
  the individual Executive Director's experience and responsibilities; and
  the pay and conditions throughout the Company.
Annual Performance Related Bonus
Policy: Upper Decile Bonus Potential
The policy of the Remuneration Committee is to set the maximum annual bonus potential at the upper decile in relation to the comparator group.
Year Ended 30 April 2004
To date the maximum bonus potential for Executives has been uncapped. However, the Remuneration Committee has taken into account the concerns 
of shareholders regarding the uncapped nature of the Executive bonus arrangements and has decided to alter the structure of the bonus to reflect these
concerns (further details of the new structure are set out below). In anticipation of the future change in policy, the Executives agreed to the introduction 
of a retrospective cap on bonuses for the current bonus year (1 May 2003 - 30 April 2004) of 300% of salary. However, for the year ended 30 April 2004,
where the Remuneration Committee did in fact determine a bonus greater than 200% of salary for the Group Managing Director and the Group Finance
Director, they decided of their own volition to cap the bonus payment at 200% of salary.
Bonus targets are reviewed and agreed by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each financial year. The performance measures for the
Executive Directors' bonus scheme are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market
conditions and position of the Company, so that they continue to remain challenging.
The targets for the year ended 30 April 2004, their level of achievement and the corresponding bonus earned for the Executive Directors is set out in the
following tables:
The above table shows that the Remuneration Committee set challenging performance conditions for the payment of bonuses for the year ended 30 April
2004, so that while the performance of the Company was strong, this did not result in maximum bonus payments.
The performance targets for the bonus year ended 30 April 2004 were based on Group profit targets for the Group Executive Directors and Divisional
profit targets for the Divisional Executive Directors. Once the targets were achieved a percentage of the over performance was allocated to the Executives
by the Remuneration Committee using pre-determined formulae. The level of the profit targets is commercially sensitive and therefore is not disclosed 
by the Company.

comparator group as a % of salary 27
www.berkeleygroup.co.uk
The Remuneration Committee felt that profit targets were the appropriate performance measure for bonuses as they were in line of sight of the Executives
and their delivery is key to long-term shareholder value. However, the Remuneration Committee recognises that in the current climate it would be helpful
to be able to disclose the detail of the performance targets for bonuses payable to the Executives, which would always be difficult due to the
commercially sensitive nature of this information.
Therefore, the Remuneration Committee has decided, in the future, to use ROCE (Return on Capital Employed - see later for a complete definition) as the
performance measure for the Group Executive Directors as this measure ensures that Executives are focused on maintaining earnings whilst having the
additional benefit of measuring the efficiency with which capital is being used to generate those earnings. For Divisional Executive Directors, 75% of the
bonus potential will still be based on the satisfaction of Divisional profit targets as the Remuneration Committee feel that it is important that the Divisional
Executive Directors have a strong focus on the performance of the Divisions which they are running, with the remaining 25% based upon Group ROCE.
Future Policy
Further to meetings with major shareholders during the year, the Remuneration Committee has taken into account their concerns regarding the uncapped
nature of the Executive bonus arrangements. Therefore, the Remuneration Committee is imposing a cap of 300% of salary for the bonus year starting on
1 May 2004 - 30 April 2005 and subsequent bonus years. In practice, the bonus plan will be designed with the effective cap on a maximum payout of
200% of salary.
The Remuneration Committee would only in very exceptional circumstances, outside the normal operation of the bonus plan, consider a bonus payment
greater than 200% of salary. On the occurrence of very exceptional circumstances and prior to any commitment to make a bonus payment, the
Remuneration Committee would consult shareholders to obtain their agreement that the circumstances gave rise to the level of bonus payment proposed.
The structure of bonus payments will be changed as follows:
Any shares provided under the bonus arrangements must be retained by the Executives for 18 months. The new bonus arrangements will take effect from
1 May 2004 (the start of the new bonus year).
The performance targets for the annual bonus plan for the 2004 Financial Year (1 May 2004 to 30 April 2005) are principally ROCE (Return on Capital
Employed) at Group level and principally ROCE and PBT (Profit Before Tax) at the Divisional level. The following table shows the weighting for participants
between Group and Divisional performance:
The ROCE target for the 2004 bonus plan year is set out in the following schedule. Currently the annual ROCE target for the bonus is the same as 
the three-year average target for the 2004 LTIP . This will not necessarily be the case in future years because the target for the annual bonus is for a 
12-month period whereas the target for the 2004 LTIP is the performance averaged over a 36-month period. However, the Remuneration Committee 
will not materially change the nature of the performance conditions or their method of calculation without prior shareholder consultation.

Remuneration Committee Report continued
*There is straight line pay-out between points.
Participants in the annual bonus plan will only be eligible to receive a bonus if they meet the performance targets. However, the Remuneration Committee
will retain the discretion to adjust bonus payments (either up or down) if in their opinion the results would otherwise be inappropriate. It should be noted
that this discretion will be exercised sparingly to ensure certainty for participants and transparency for shareholders. If the Remuneration Committee does
exercise its discretion to adjust bonus payments it will only do so where there is an objective justification which can be explained to shareholders in the
Remuneration Committee report. In addition, the Remuneration Committee will ensure that any changes to the basis of payment or financial performance
targets are independently verified.
On an ongoing basis, the Remuneration Committee will continue to set robust and challenging performance targets at the beginning of each financial year
taking into account the business plan for that year and general market conditions.
Bonus payments are not pensionable.
The following formula sets out how the Company calculates ROCE for both the 2004 annual bonus plan and the new 2004 LTIP:
ROCE % =
Earnings before Interest, Tax and Goodwill
x 100
Average Shareholders' Funds + Average Net Debt
{}
(i) Average Shareholders' Funds is calculated by taking the Opening Balance Sheet Net Assets from the Group's Accounts for the relevant Financial Year
and the Closing Balance Sheet Net Assets from the Group's Accounts for the relevant Financial Year and dividing by two.
(ii) Average Net Debt is calculated by taking the Opening Net Debt from the Group's Accounts for the relevant Financial Year and the Closing Net 
Debt from the Group's Accounts for the relevant Financial Year and dividing by two, and where the Group is cash positive, such cash is excluded from 
the calculation.
Share Incentives
Policy: Upper Quartile to Upper Decile
The Remuneration Committee's policy is to provide annual share grants to Executives between the upper quartile and upper decile level compared to the
comparator group.
The Remuneration Committee determines whether the performance conditions for share awards or options are satisfied. Where the performance
requirements are based on earnings per share, ROCE or PBT the Committee will use the principles behind the audited figures disclosed in the Company's
financial statements, and may take advice from independent advisors as to whether any adjustments are required to ensure consistency in accordance
with the terms of the performance conditions. Where the performance measure is TSR, Halliwell Consulting, the Remuneration Committee's advisors, 
shall calculate the TSR in accordance with the principles behind the regulations and sign-off these figures prior to the release of any award.
Overview
Until the EGM on 24 February 2004, the share incentive arrangements in place for executives comprised Long Term Incentive Plans and Executive 
Share Option Schemes (details are as set out below). It was the Remuneration Committee's policy to grant awards to participants under either the 
Long Term Incentive Plans or the Executive Share Option Schemes and only in exceptional circumstances would grants be made in the same year 
under both arrangements.

19% 80%*
20% 100%* 29
www.berkeleygroup.co.uk
Following shareholder approval at the EGM, the new 2004 LTIP has been adopted by the Company. The Remuneration Committee's policy is that
Executives who participate in the new 2004 LTIP will receive no further award under either the existing Long Term Incentive Plans or the Executive Share
Option Schemes. It should be noted that participants in the 2004 LTIP will not be entitled to the grant of awards under any other discretionary share plan
operated by the Company (participants will be entitled to participate in any all-employee arrangements operated by the Company). In addition, the
Remuneration Committee intends to introduce a shareholding requirement for Executives in conjunction with the new 2004 LTIP , details of which are set
out on pages 30-32 of this report.
Existing Share Incentive Arrangements
a) The Berkeley Group Long Term Incentive Plan
Until the EGM, the principal form of long term incentive eligible to Executive Directors was through the Berkeley Group Long Term Incentive Plan (the
 Existing LTIP'). Under the Existing LTIP , individuals were granted awards annually, the vesting of which were subject to the attainment of pre-determined
performance targets measured over a three-year period. Awards were structured to deliver a pre-determined cash value and a number of shares, each
worth at the outset 50% of the value of the total annual award. The shares element was fixed by reference to the market value of the Company's shares
at the date of grant. The maximum value that could be delivered under an award (based on the share price at the date of grant) is 200% of an individual's
annual salary (excluding bonuses and all other benefits) as at the date of grant.
The cash element is payable following the third anniversary of the date of grant of the award provided the performance targets have been met. 
The participant is normally only entitled to the share element following the fourth anniversary from the date of grant of the award, by which time the
outstanding value of the underlying shares will have increased or decreased in line with the Company's share price performance over the period since the
date of grant. Performance under the Existing LTIP was measured according to the level of audited cumulative pre-tax profits of the division or Group
company in which the participant is employed over the relevant period. Achievement is determined on an  all or nothing' basis over a period of three years
with no opportunity for re-testing. For awards under the LTIP to vest, the audited net assets of each division or Group Company, after taking account of
changes in share capital and dividend distributions, must also have increased by at least a cumulative rate of 10% per annum since the base year.
These performance conditions were selected because it was the Board's view that profit and asset growth will ensure the delivery of enhanced value to
the Company's shareholders.
Details of LTIP awards granted during the year are set out at page 36.
The following table sets out the expected value of the LTIP awards on the date of grant made under the Existing LTIP to the Executive Directors during
the year ended 30 April 2004:
Based on historical analysis of the achievement of the performance requirements the expected value of the LTIP is 100% of its face value.
b) The Berkeley Group plc 2000 Approved & Unapproved Executive Share Option Plans ( the Option Plans')
Two executive option plans were introduced in 2000. Under the option plans individuals were eligible to be granted options annually over shares worth up
to 100% of annual salary (excluding bonuses and all other benefits). The Remuneration Committee had the discretion to vary this amount in exceptional
circumstances, in which case the limit was 200% of annual salary (excluding bonuses and all other benefits). Exercise of options granted is conditional
upon meeting defined performance targets based on the increase in earnings per ordinary share over a three-year period.

Remuneration Committee Report continued
On 19 April 2004, a grant of options was made to Mr A W Pidgley under the Option Plans, details of which are shown on page 37. The performance
target attaching to this option provides that over a three-year period EPS growth must exceed RPI+4%p.a. for 50% of the option to vest, with full vesting
requiring EPS growth of RPI+8%p.a. The rules of the Plan under which this option was granted allows for limited re-testing. However, the Remuneration
Committee has taken into account the wishes of shareholders and this option to the Group Managing Director will not allow re-testing of the performance
target. The expected value of this option on the date of grant is  631,349, 84% of salary (using the Black-Scholes Calculation).
It should be noted that during the shareholder consultation exercise carried out by the Company this option and its proposed terms were specifically
drawn to shareholders' attention. The majority of shareholders (by percentage holding) confirmed that they would accept the grant of this option.
No other grants of options have been made to Executive Directors under the Option Plans during the year.
Earnings per share was selected as the performance measure as, in combination with options, it ensures that both the Company's share price and its
underlying financial value increases before any benefit is provided to Executives.
New Share Incentive Arrangements
The Berkeley Group plc 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  2004 LTIP')
The 2004 LTIP was approved by shareholders at the EGM on 24 February 2004. Prior to the EGM, the Company conducted a full consultation with major
shareholders and shareholder bodies which ensured that the terms of the Plan were acceptable to the majority of shareholders by percentage holding and
complied with corporate governance best practice.
Executive Directors and certain senior executives are eligible to participate in the Company's 2004 LTIP. The Plan provides appropriate incentives to
reward sustained success through the achievement of challenging business targets, thereby better aligning the interests of shareholders and Executives.
The maximum annual award that can be made to an individual is 300% of salary; although it should be noted that the only Executive Director currently
eligible to receive the maximum level of award is the Group Managing Director.
Eligible executives are awarded rights to receive a maximum number of shares at the beginning of a three-year period, a proportion of which they will be
entitled to receive at the end of that period depending on the extent to which (if at all) the challenging performance conditions, set by the Remuneration
Committee at the time the allocation is made, are satisfied.
The release of the first grant of awards under the 2004 LTIP will be dependent upon the satisfaction of two performance measures. The release of 50% 
of each award will be dependant on the comparative Total Shareholder Return performance of the Company against the comparator group set out earlier
in the report over a three-year period and the release of the other 50% of the awards will be dependent on the average ROCE performance of the
Company over a three-year period from the date of grant. The Remuneration Committee has selected a comparative TSR and a ROCE measure to
ensure that the Company is not only consistently delivering high levels of returns but that on a comparative basis it is also delivering at least median 
share price performance against its competitors. In addition, the use of the ROCE measure ensures an efficient use of shareholders' funds to generate
profitability at a consistent level over the long term. When combined with the TSR measure it ensures that this absolute performance successfully flows
through to the comparative performance of the Company against its competitors.
It should be noted that the Remuneration Committee will satisfy itself that the recorded TSR is a genuine reflection of the underlying financial performance
of the Company. Due to the combined nature of awards made under the proposed share incentive policy, some of the corporate performance measures
that the Remuneration Committee will be considering in determining whether the recorded TSR is a genuine reflection of the underlying financial
performance of the Company are its ROCE, EPS and PBT performance over the measurement period.
No grants were made under the new LTIP during the year.  31

Dilution
In accordance with the ABI guidelines the Company can issue a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling ten-year period to employees
under all its share schemes. In addition, of this 10% the Company can only issue 5% to satisfy awards under discretionary or executive schemes. 
The Company adheres strictly to these limits.
Shareholding Requirement
The following table shows the minimum shareholding requirement as a percentage of salary which Executives will be required to build up over a five-
year period:
Executives will be required to retain a proportion of the share awards released each year to build up the shareholding requirement over a five-year period.
For example, awards granted in 2004, 2005 and 2006 will be released in 2007, 2008 and 2009. A proportion of each released award shall be retained as
shares so that by the end of 2008 Executives should have met the minimum shareholding requirement.

Remuneration Committee Report continued
When considering whether the Executive has met the minimum shareholding requirement the Remuneration Committee will take into account all shares
held by the Executive. Participants will only be required to meet the minimum shareholding requirement from shares provided through the Company share
arrangements; if these do not provide shares the Executive will not be expected to purchase shares in the market. If the Company share arrangements
provide the Executive with shares and the appropriate percentage is not retained by the Executive, the Remuneration Committee will reduce the future
levels of share incentives granted. The Remuneration Committee will consider the circumstances surrounding an Executive's disposal of shares as part 
of its determination. For example, if an Executive was required by a Court order to transfer shares this would be a mitigating factor.
Pension
Policy: Lower Quartile to Median
The Executive Directors are all members of one or more of the following pensions schemes in operation within the Group, namely The Berkeley Group
Staff Benefits Plan, The Berkeley Homes Executive Pension Plan and The St George PLC Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme. No element of
remuneration other than basic salary is pensionable.
Three Directors have benefits accruing to them under a defined contributions scheme and three have benefits accruing to them under a defined benefits
scheme. Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in these schemes. 
Details of pension costs for Executive Directors are set out in the audited section of the report on page 35.
Benefits in Kind
Policy: Market Practice
In line with market practice, the Company's policy is to provide Executive Directors with the following additional benefits:
  a fully expensed company car; and
  medical insurance.
Other Remuneration Matters
Existing All Employee Share Schemes
SAYE Scheme
The Company operates an Inland Revenue approved savings related share option scheme for the benefit of Group employees. Eligible employees,
including Executive Directors and senior executives, may be granted options over the Company's shares at a discount of up to 20% to the prevailing
market price at the time of grant of the option, which (subject to certain conditions) can be exercised after either three or five years.
Approximately 23% of eligible Group employees currently participate in the scheme.
New All-Employee Share Schemes
The Berkeley Group plc 2004 Share Incentive Plan ( 2004 SIP')
Shareholders approved the 2004 SIP at the EGM on 24 February 2004. Under the Inland Revenue approved rules of the SIP the Company can offer
employees the opportunity of purchasing  1,500 of shares a year out of pre-tax salary. The Company can then match each share purchased with an
award of  Matching Shares'. The maximum ratio of Matching Shares to employee purchased shares is two to one. However, the Company is still
determining the date of launch and how the SIP will operate.
Non-executive Directors' Fees
Policy: Upper Decile Fees
All Non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by the articles 
of association and based on independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors of similar companies. The 2004 fee levels will be based on a
specific survey of the fees paid to non-executive directors in the comparator group by Halliwell Consulting. The basic fee paid to each Non-executive
Director in the year was  30,000 per annum. Further fees are payable for additional work performed in respect of the Chairmanship of the Remuneration
and Audit Committees ( 4,000 p.a.). Non-executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Company's share incentive schemes or performance based
plans and are not eligible to join the Company's pension scheme. 33
www.berkeleygroup.co.uk
Executive Directors' Contracts
The policy on termination is that the Company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations. The only event on the occurrence of which
the Company is potentially liable to make a payment to any of the Executive Directors is on cessation of employment; with the maximum payment being
12 months' salary. No payment is due on either a Company takeover or in the event of liquidation. In addition, Executive Directors will be expected to
mitigate their loss. The Remuneration Committee is considering introducing phasing the payments of notice on cessation in line with the combined ABI
and NAPF guidelines, subject to existing contractual constraints. In addition, the Remuneration Committee ensures that there have been no unjustified
payments for failure. None of the Executive Directors' contracts provides for liquidated damages. There are no special provisions contained in any of the
Executive Directors' contracts which provide for longer periods of notice on a change of control of the Company. Further, there are no special provisions
providing for additional compensation on an Executive Director's cessation of employment with the Company.
Non-executive Directors
All non-executive appointments are subject to a notice period of one month and subject to successful re-election upon retirement by rotation as required
by the Company's articles of association. All letters of appointment for Non-executive Directors are renewable annually on 1 May.
Further details of all Directors' contracts are summarised below:

All the Directors, other than Mr Pidgley, joined the Group after the Inland Revenue introduced an Earnings Cap for calculating pension benefits in 1989, and this is reflected 
in the calculation of accumulated accrued pension entitlements above. In prior years the disclosure provided assumed that all Directors' benefits would be enhanced. 
This change has been made to properly reflect the scheme rules. The figures at 30 April 2003 in respect of these Directors have been restated accordingly, as have the
associated transfer values in the table below.

Other than Mr Pidgley, the above Directors are non-contributory members of the plan. The change in transfer value during the year for Mr Pidgley,
excluding contributions paid by him, is  1,108,381.
The transfer values of the Directors' accrued benefits under the Defined Benefit Plan, as set out above, are calculated in accordance with the  Retirement
Benefits Scheme - Transfer Values (GN11)' published by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries. The transfer values disclosed above
represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the liability in respect of
qualifying services. As such they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.These transfer values do not represent a sum paid or payable to the
individual Director and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration. Members of the fund have the option to pay additional voluntary
contributions; neither these contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the transfer values in the table above.
In addition to the above, the Company made the following contributions to defined contribution plans:

The participants received the cash element of the 2000 awards during the year. They will receive the share element of these awards during 2004.

The Remuneration Committee has determined that the performance targets for the 2001 awards have been met. Accordingly, participants will receive the cash element of
these awards on 7 August 2004 and the share element 12 months later, assuming they remain in the employment of the Group.
The relevant performance measures are set out on page 29. These are the achievement of pre-determined cumulative pre-tax profits over a three year period and cumulative
net asset growth of at least 10% over the period, taking account of changes in share capital and dividend distributions. For Messrs Pidgley and Perrins these targets are
measured on the Group results and for Messrs Carey and Fry on the relevant divisional results.
(3)
Mr Hutchinson resigned as a Main Board Director on 27 August 2004, at which time he ceased to benefit from the Long Term Incentive Plan.
The mid-market share price of the Company on 21 December 2000 was 712.5p, on 7 August 2001 was 725.5p, on 19 August 2002 was 665.0p and on
22 July 2003 was 762.5p.
The mid-market share price was 625.0p as at 1 May 2003 and 980.0p as at 30 April 2004. The mid-market high and low share prices of the Company
during the year were 1060.0p and 620.0p respectively.
No Director received shares or other payments during the year from the Group's long term executive incentive schemes. For the year ended 30 April
2003, Messrs Fry and Hutchinson received a final share bonus with a value at allocation of  278,795 and  293,169 respectively as part of the Long Term
Executive Incentive Scheme 1996. 37

The mid-market share price of the Company was 625.0p as at 1 May 2003 and 980.0p as at 30 April 2004. The mid-market high and low share prices 
of the Company during the year were 1,060.0p and 620.0p respectively. No options of Directors in office at 30 April 2004 lapsed unexercised during the
year. There were no changes in the interests of the Directors shown above between 1 May 2004 and the date of this report. 
Where performance conditions exist for the option schemes, these are set out below:
(1)
Under the 2000 Approved Plan and the 2000 Plan, 50% of the shares under option (up to a maximum of 4,000 shares) are released if compound Earnings Per Share (EPS)
growth exceeds the Retail Prices Index (RPI) + 4% per annum. The balance of shares under option are released subject to graduated, increasingly demanding performance
targets, up to a compound growth of RPI + 8%.
(2)
On 30 April 2003, Mr Pidgley was granted 205,481 options. The vesting of these options will be based on share price growth rather than the EPS based conditions
mentioned above. The options will vest in full only if the Company's share price increases by at least 50% within a three to five-year period (based on the three-month
average share price set on the date of grant). The number of shares vesting will be calculated on a sliding scale for share price growth between 20% and 50%. At 20%
growth, 10% of the options vest. Below 20%, no options vest. These options will lapse if the performance conditions have not been met within five years of grant.
(3)
Under the 1996 Scheme, the shares under option are released subject to the Company's average yearly EPS growth being at least as much as the increase in RPI + 3% in
each year over three consecutive years.
For all options exercised in the year, performance conditions were fully met.
The mid-market share price of the Company on 2 September 2003 was 879.5p and on 4 March 2004 was 947.0p.
Aggregate gains made by Directors on the exercise of share options in the year amounted to  132,120 (2003:  475).
