Bespak QUEST Limited was established in March 1999 as a qualifying share ownership trust (QUEST) to acquire ordinary shares of 
the Company for supply to employees exercising options under the Bespak plc Savings Related Share Option scheme. Shares acquired
by the QUEST are recorded under  investments' as detailed in Note 13 on page 00 of these accounts in accordance with Abstract

contributions to the employee trust from Group companies. The balance of the consideration for the 200,000 shares acquired in 
the Company during the year was funded by a loan from Bespak plc. The difference between the cost of the shares acquired by the 
QUEST and the option price to employees is shown as a movement in reserves in Note 22 on page ??.
In the year Bespak QUEST Limited transferred 5,390 ordinary shares to employees for a total consideration of  21,000 to satisfy 
entitlements under the Company Savings Related Share Option Scheme.

(iii) Legal proceedings
In January 2002 the European Patent Office Opposition Board ruled against the Group, upholding the patent rights of a competitor 
in the field of metered dose inhaler valves. It is likely that an appeal will be made against the decision and the eventual outcome 
of the dispute is uncertain. The directors do not expect that a material loss will result from the proceedings and as a result no 
provision has been made. 58-59
Notes to the Accounts
26 Pension Commitments
The Group operates a number of pension
schemes in the UK and USA, the assets of
which are held in trustee administered funds
separate from the finances of the Group.
The main UK retirement benefits plan is a
defined benefit scheme. The last full actuarial
valuation of this scheme was carried out by a
qualified independent actuary as at 1 May 1999
and updated on an approximate basis as at 3
May 2002 to determine the scheme assets and
liabilities under FRS17. The valuation of this
scheme is assessed using the projected unit
method on the basis of triennial valuations.  
The valuation at 1 May 1999 showed that the
market value of the assets of the scheme was
 14,066,097 and that the actuarial value of
those assets represented 84% of the benefits
that had accrued to members, after allowing
for investment growth and anticipated future
increases in earnings. The most significant
financial assumptions affecting the results of
the valuation were that future price inflation
would average 2.8% per annum whilst the rate
of return on investments would average 5.95%
per annum, future wages and salaries would
increase by 3.8% per annum, and post-April
1988 guaranteed minimum pensions would
increase by an average of 2.85% per annum. 
Following consultation between the Company
and the trustees, the Company's contribution
rates have been increased in order to
eliminate the deficit over the remaining
service lives of the current members
(estimated to be 20 years). At 1 May 2000 the
scheme was 99% funded on the Minimum
Funding Requirement (MFR) basis and the
current contribution rates are above those
required under the MFR Regulations to meet
the target of 100% MFR by April 2007. The
agreed contribution rates to the pension
scheme vary from 8.1% to 17.7% of
pensionable salary, according to eligibility of
benefit. The contributions made by the Group
to the scheme during the year amounted to
 1,633,000 (2001  2,080,000). Accrued pension
costs included in creditors at the year end
amounted to  168,000 (2001  153,000).  
During the year, the Board approved the
closure of the Group's defined benefit scheme
to new entrants with effect from 1 January
2003. Under this plan, existing members will
be required to fund any increase required 
in contributions if they wish to remain in 
the scheme. The pension costs to the Group
of the defined benefit scheme should not
increase significantly in the future.
Contributions will be made to a defined
contribution scheme for employees leaving 
the defined benefit scheme.
The Company is committed to the payment 
of a pension to a former director which is
increased in line with the Retail Prices Index. 
FRS 17 disclosures
The Group continues to account for pension
arrangements in accordance with SSAP 24
 Accounting for pension costs'. Under the
transitional provisions of FRS 17,  Retirement
benefits' certain disclosures are required on
the basis of the valuation methodology
adopted by FRS 17.  
The financial assumptions used to calculate
scheme liabilities under FRS17 are:
The assets and liabilities in the scheme and
the expected rate of return were:
The assets and liabilities of the scheme,
shown above, both exclude the accumulated
value of Additional Voluntary Contributions
paid by members. These total approximately
 0.5 million.
If the above amounts had been recognised 
in the financial statements, the Group's net
assets and profit and loss reserve at 3 May
2002 would be as follows:
The Group also made payments into defined
contribution schemes on behalf of a number 
of employees. Pension costs charged in the 
year relating to this scheme amounted to
 139,000 (2001  82,000), which was paid 
in full during the year.
In the USA, the Company operates savings 
and investment plans qualified under Section
401(K) of the Internal Revenue Code. Pension
costs charged in the year relating to these 
plans amounted to  99,000 (2001  100,000),
which was paid in full during the year.
