DIRECTOR'S REMUNERATION REPORT
REMUNERATION AND NOMINATION COMMITTEES
The Company has a remuneration committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations
of the Combined Code. The members of the committee during 2007 were William Henbrey and Michael
Hindmarch (Chairman of the Committee).
Details of the remuneration of each Director are set out below.
No Director plays part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of high
calibre, who are needed to drive and maintain the Company's position as a market leader and to reward them
for enhancing value to shareholders.
REMUNERATION POLICY SHARE OPTIONS
The Directors have options granted to them under the terms of the approved and unapproved share option
schemes which are open to other qualifying employees. The reason for the scheme is to incentivise the
Directors and management personnel and enable them to benefit from the increased market capitalisation of
the Company. The exercise of options under the scheme is based upon the satisfaction of conditions relating
to the share price. The conditions vary from grant to grant.
As at 30th April 2007 three of the Directors, Rupert Garton, William Henbrey and Nicholas Ziebland, held
options. Conditions of these options are detailed on page 6.
PENSION ARRANGEMENTS
There are no pension arrangements in the Company.
DIRECTORS' CONTRACTS
It is the Company's policy that executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term providing
for a maximum of six months notice in the event of early termination, the Directors' contracts provide for
compensation, where appropriate, up to a maximum of basic salary for the notice period.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The fees of non-executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole having regard to the
commitment of time required and the level of fees in similar companies.
Non-executive Directors are employed on renewable fixed term contracts not exceeding one year.

As at the 30th April 2007 Mr R Garton was due a performance bonus of  40,000 as agreed by the Board of

that Mr Garton may take his bonus in this way, but only after the end of the close period.
