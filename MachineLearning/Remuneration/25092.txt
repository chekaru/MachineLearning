 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Company has a remuneration committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations
of the Combined Code. The members of the committee are Michael Hindmarch (Chairman of the
Committee) and Colin Hargrave.
Details of the remuneration of each Director are set out below.
No Director plays part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of high
calibre, who are needed to drive and maintain the Group's position as a market leader and to reward them
for enhancing value to the shareholder.
REMUNERATION POLICY
SHARE OPTIONS
Certain Directors have options granted to them under the terms of the approved and unapproved share option
schemes which are open to other qualifying employees. The reason for the schemes is to incentivise and
retain the Directors and key personnel and enable them to benefit from the increased market capitalisation
of the Company. The exercise of options under the scheme is based upon the satisfaction of conditions
relating to the share price. The conditions vary from grant to grant.
As at 30th April 2012, two of the Directors, Rupert Garton and Colin Hargrave, held options. Details and
conditions of these options are detailed on page 6.
PENSION ARRANGEMENTS
A reserve has been made during the year to 30th April 2012 based upon the ability of Executive Directors to
benefit from pension contributions as detailed in their contracts. It is the intention of the Directors to
commence payment into a Defined Contribution Self Invested Pension Plan in the near future.
During the year, the Company provided  2,000 (2011:  12,000) in respect of Executive Director pension
payments. At the year end,  nil (2011:  nil) was outstanding and owing to the scheme.
DIRECTORS' CONTRACTS
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term providing
for a maximum of six months notice. In the event of early termination, the Directors' contracts provide for
compensation, where appropriate, up to a maximum of basic salary for the notice period.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The fees of non-executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole having regard to the
commitment of time required and the level of fees in similar companies.
Non-executive Directors are engaged on renewable fixed term contracts not exceeding one year.
