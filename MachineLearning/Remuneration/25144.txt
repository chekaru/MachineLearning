 Introduction
This report sets out the Group's policy and disclosures in relation to 
Directors' remuneration for the year ended 30 April 2011. The report has 
been presented on behalf of the Board and complies fully with the Listing 
rules, the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium 
Sized Companies (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the combined code ) as 
applicable for the fi nancial year. The report has been audited by KPMG 
Audit Plc to the extent required by regulators. This report will be put 
to Betfair's shareholders for approval at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee's remit includes determining the broad 
policy for remuneration, as well as each element of remuneration for 
the Executive Directors of the Company, the Company Secretary, the 
Chairman and designated members of executive management. The 
Remuneration Committee is also responsible for overseeing all share 
schemes and advising the Board on any signifi cant changes in employee 
benefi t policies or structures throughout the Company. The Committee 
has agreed terms of reference that are available on the Company's 
website, or on request from the Company Secretary, who also acts as 
Secretary of the Remuneration Committee. The Group complied with the 
provisions of the Code relating to Directors' remuneration throughout the 
fi nancial year.
The Remuneration Committee currently comprises three independent 
Non-executive Directors, in compliance with the Code. The Remuneration 
Committee is chaired by Mike McTighe, and its other members are 
Ian Dyson and Fru Hazlitt. All three members served on the Remuneration 
Committee throughout the year. 
The Committee meets at least twice each year, and during the year under 
review met on fi ve occasions. Each member's attendance at these meetings 
is set out in the Corporate Governance report on page 46. The Committee 
received material assistance and advice from the Chairman, Chief 
Executive Offi cer and the Group Human Resources Director, although no 
individual is present for decisions relating to their personal remuneration.
The Committee and the Group also received advice from Kepler Associates, 
a fi rm of independent remuneration consultants. Kepler Associates does 
not provide any other services to the Group. The Committee has also been 
advised by Freshfi elds Bruckhaus Deringer LLP who are one of the Group's 
legal advisors and who have advised the Group on various legal matters. 
Remuneration Policy
Betfair's remuneration is designed to provide a strong link to short and 
long-term performance through a simple and transparent framework. To 
attract, motivate and retain the highest calibre executives, the Company 
targets total fi xed pay at around market median, and incentive 
opportunities to allow executives to earn upper quartile levels of reward 
for upper quartile levels of performance. In determining the structure and 
quantum of senior executive remuneration, the Committee also takes 
into account pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.

Betfair Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2011    shares vest 50% after 1 year and 50% after 2 years from the date of 
grant, subject to continued employment. Based on the Group's fi nancial 
performance, it was determined that no STIP cash payments would 
be made to Executive Directors in respect of the year to 30 April 2011.
For the year to 30 April 2012, Executive Directors will continue to be 
eligible for a maximum STIP opportunity of 180% of salary. The STIP 
will continue to reinforce our annual business strategy by incentivising 
profi table growth captured through Core Betfair Adjusted EBITDA and 
revenue. Up to 85% of salary will be available for meeting the maximum 
targets under each fi nancial measure. In order to incentivise and reward 
wider aspects of business performance, and capture lead measures, an 
element based on individual performance is being introduced into the STIP 
for FY12. Executive Directors will be eligible to earn up to 10% of salary for 
achieving specifi c and measurable individual objectives. No bonus will 
be payable under the element on individual objectives unless a threshold 
EBITDA is met.
Long-Term Incentive Plan 
The Remuneration Committee believes that it is important to provide 
share incentives to Executive Directors and senior management to 
align their long-term interests with those of Betfair's shareholders.
The Long- Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) provides for awards of both fair-
market value options and nil-cost options to senior executives (including 
Executive Directors). Award sizes are determined based on a number of 
options rather than as a fi xed multiple of salary to improve shareholder 
alignment and reduce upward pressure on salaries. Options will normally 
vest no earlier than the third anniversary of grant, and be subject to the 
achievement of performance conditions set over three years.
During the year the Chief Executive Offi cer, David Yu and Chief Financial 
Offi cer, Stephen Morana were conditionally awarded 130,000 and 
100,000 fair market value options respectively, as well as 15,000 nil-cost 
options each. These options will normally vest on the third anniversary of 
grant and are subject to two corporate fi nancial performance conditions. 
The extent to which awards vest depends 50.0% on Group's EBITDA 
growth and 50.0% on Group's revenue growth. Targets are set as   million 
amounts for the fi nancial year ending 30 April 2013. Vesting occurs on a 
sliding scale, with no vesting under the EBITDA element unless at least 
91.5% of a stretching target is achieved, and full vesting only if 120.0% of 
the target is achieved. The corresponding performance range for revenue 
is 95.8% and 110.0% of target respectively. For reasons of commercial 
sensitivity the Remuneration Committee doesn't feel it is appropriate 
to publish the actual targets at this time. However it will commit to 
providing disclosure around performance against targets following the 
end of the performance period.
To the extent that the performance targets are not met over the 
performance period, awards will lapse, i.e. there will be no re-testing 
of performance conditions. In the event of a change of control, vesting 
of options is not automatic and would depend on the extent to which 
the performance conditions had been met at the time and the period 
elapsed since the date of grant.
The Committee selected EBITDA and revenue as the most appropriate 
measures of long-term performance for 2010-2011 option awards as they 
are highly visible internally, regularly monitored, and reinforce our growth 
strategy as described above. However, in recognition of the Company's 
recent listing, the Committee feels that introducing EPS would help to 
improve alignment with shareholders, and better refl ect market practice 
at FTSE-listed companies. The Committee therefore intends to maintain 
a 50% weighting on revenue for FY12 awards but to replace EBITDA with 
EPS for the remaining 50% of awards. The Committee is currently 
determining the appropriate targets for EPS, and will disclose these in 
next year's Directors' Remuneration Report.
The Committee considers that the Company's incentives are compatible 
with the Group's risk policies and systems, and is satisfied that the 
approach to setting the structure of remuneration packages for senior 
executives underpins an effective and proper management of risk; 
rewarding executives fairly for sustainable profit growth and long-term 
shareholder value creation, and delivering a significant proportion of 
executive remuneration in Betfair shares. 
Executive Director pay mix FY12
The chart below shows the relative importance of each element of the 
expected package for Executive Directors for FY12, based on the target 
STIP and the fair value of the LTIP:
Basic salary
Basic salaries are normally reviewed annually and any changes are 
effective from 1 July each year. In reviewing salaries the Remuneration 
Committee takes into account pay and conditions elsewhere across the 
Group, relevant market data, and the individual Director's performance 
and experience. Benchmarking is carried out on a total remuneration 
basis, and takes account of pay levels for comparable roles at a range 
of organisations of similar size and sector. 
The current salaries for Executive Directors are set out below, and were 
increased effective 1 July 2011 by 3%, in line with general increases 
throughout the Group.

Short-Term Incentive Plan
For the year to 30 April 2011, Executive Directors and other senior 
executives participated in the Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP), which 
was based on the achievement of pre-defined EBITDA and revenue 
targets, with an equal weighting on each performance measure. Executive 
Directors were eligible for a maximum STIP opportunity of 180% of salary, 
with 120% of salary payable for achieving stretching target  performance 
levels on both measures. Both revenue and EBITDA are measured at the 
Group level for the Executive Directors. EBITDA and revenue are felt by 
the Board to be the best measures of short-term fi nancial performance 
for Betfair. The use of revenue aligns with our strategic objectives of 
widening the range of products and services that we offer, attracting 
new customers, increasing the activity of existing customers, and building 
our market share in all regions in which we operate. Rewarding EBITDA 
alongside revenue helps ensure a balance between growth and 
profi tability. Two thirds of any STIP payment is delivered in cash, with 
the remaining one third deferred into Betfair Group shares. Deferred

2011 overview
Governance
Financial statements The Committee has also determined that for 2011-2012, the balance of 
LTIP awards will be shifted from cash towards nil-cost options, while the 
overall fair value will remain broadly unchanged. The Committee believes 
that this will improve the robustness of the LTIP, provide a more 
motivational incentive for senior management, and also improve 
alignment with shareholder interests.
Senior Executives' Incentive Plan
The Senior Executives' Incentive Plan 2010 (SEIP) granted certain senior 
employees and Executive Directors one-off conditional awards consisting 
of a cash amount and an award of nil-cost options on Admission to the 
Stock Exchange (Admission ). Under the terms of the SEIP, 50% of the 
options will vest and become exercisable on the fi rst anniversary of 
Admission and the remainder will become exercisable on the second 
anniversary of Admission, subject to continued employment. Awards 
were made to the Executive Directors under this plan on listing, as shown 
in the table on page 54. The Company does not intend to make any 
further awards under the SEIP.
All-employee share schemes
The Group operates an HMRC-approved SAYE scheme, in which all UK 
employees including Executive Directors may participate. Participants 
can save up to  250 per month for three years and then use these savings 
to buy shares in the Group at a 20% discount to the market value at the 
start of the savings period. 
Share Option Plan
The 2009 Unapproved Option Plan allows executives to be granted 
fair-market value options vesting subject only to continued employment. 
This plan is only used to attract and recruit new employees to the Company, 
and the Committee does not intend to make further awards to the 
current Executive Directors.
Other long-term incentive plans 
Executive Directors also hold awards under other incentive plans operated 
prior to Admission. Any applicable performance conditions on these 
awards have now been met. The Committee does not currently intend 
to make any further awards to Executive Directors under these plans. 
Further details on share awards made during the year to 30 April 2011 
can be found at page 54.
The Company intends to establish share ownership guidelines for senior 
executives. Each Executive Director will be required to build a shareholding 
of 100% of base salary over a period of five years from the time the 
shareholding guidelines are introduced or from appointment if later.
Dilution
The Group's share schemes are funded through a combination of shares 
purchased in the market and new issue shares. Funding of awards through 
new issue shares is subject to an overall dilution limit of 10% of issued 
share capital in any 10 year period. 
Pension contributions
Executive Directors are entitled to a Company pension contribution 
of 10% of basic salary into the Group's Personal Pension Plan (GPPP ) 
which is a Defined Contribution scheme open to all employees. 
As an alternative, executives may choose to take the amount as 
a cash supplement.
Other benefi ts
Benefi ts in kind for Executive Directors include life assurance, private 
medical care and critical illness cover. There is currently no car or car 
allowance policy.
Executive Director service contracts
The Remuneration Committee's policy is to provide service contracts for 
Executive Directors with notice periods of 12 months or less. Stephen 
Morana entered into a service agreement with the Group dated 27 July 
2010, which is subject to 12 months' notice by either party. David Yu 
entered into a service agreement with the Group dated 13 September 
2010. His service agreement can be terminated by either party on service 
of 12 months' written notice. Upon Admission, the required notice period 
increased to 24 months, reducing by one month on the 1st of the month 
following Admission and the 1st of each month thereafter until the fi rst 
anniversary of Admission, so that the period of notice required to be given 
by either party at any time on or after the fi rst anniversary of Admission 
is 12 months. Upon termination, Executive Directors are entitled to salary 
(and medical insurance for David Yu) for the duration of their notice 
period. It is the Remuneration Committee's policy to seek to mitigate 
such payments. 
External Directorships for Executive Directors
None of the Executive Directors currently have external Directorships 
although, at the discretion of the Board, they may be appointed as a 
Non-executive Director at one other company. Before granting permission 
the Board will take into account inter alia the time commitment of 
the new role, any potential confl icts, the Listing Rules and the Code.
Non-executive Directors (NEDs )
All NEDs' services are provided for under the terms of a letter of appointment 
with the Group, and are subject to annual re-election with one month's 
notice by either party. Details of the terms of the appointment of the 
current NEDs are as follows:
