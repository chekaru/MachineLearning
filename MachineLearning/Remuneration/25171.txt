 A REMUNERATION POLICY.
ALIGNED TO OUR 
STRATEGY.
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
During the year ended 30 April 2012, the Remuneration Committee has 
worked hard to continue to develop the remuneration policy, improving 
the alignment with both the Company's short and long-term strategy  
and best and market practice.
While there have been no significant changes to the remuneration policy 
in terms of structure and quantum, a number of changes are being 
proposed to the Short Term Incentive Plan (STIP) and Long Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP) to simplify the arrangements and better align them to current 
practice, including; the introduction of dividend roll-up and clawback 
provisions, separating the STIP into a cash plan and a deferred share 
incentive plan and, in respect of the LTIP, granting nil cost options rather 
than a combination of market value and nil cost options (a rebalancing 
which started last year) and expressing awards as a percentage of salary 
rather than a fixed number of shares. Following consultation with the 
Company's major investors, changes will also be made to the LTIP 
performance conditions. Further details of these changes are provided 
within the report below and, where shareholder approval is being sought 
(e.g. for the dividend roll-up and separate deferred share incentive plan), 
in the Notice of Annual General Meeting (AGM ). The Committee also 
dealt with the departure of our CEO, the appointment of an Interim CEO 
and the recruitment of a new CEO during the year.
A summary of the main topics discussed at the Committee meetings 
during the year can be found below. 
I hope that you will support the Directors' Remuneration Report 
resolution which will be put to the forthcoming AGM.
Introduction
The contents of this report sets out the Group's policy and disclosures in 
relation to Directors' remuneration for the year ended 30 April 2012. The 
report has been presented on behalf of the Board and complies fully with 
the Listing rules, the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 to the Large 
and Medium Sized Companies (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
and the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code ) as applicable for the 
financial year. The relevant sections of this report have been audited by 
KPMG Audit Plc. This report will be put to shareholders for approval at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee's remit includes determining the broad 
policy for remuneration, as well as each element of remuneration for the 
Executive Directors of the Company, the Company Secretary, the 
Chairman and designated members of executive management. The 
Remuneration Committee is also responsible for overseeing all share 
schemes and advising the Board on any significant changes in employee 
benefit policies or structures throughout the Company. The Committee 
has agreed terms of reference that are available on the Company's 
website, or on request from the Company Secretary, who also acts as 
Secretary of the Remuneration Committee. The Group has complied with 
the provisions of the Code relating to Directors' remuneration throughout 
the financial year.
The Remuneration Committee currently comprises three independent 
Non-executive Directors, in compliance with the Code. The Remuneration 
Committee is chaired by Mike McTighe, and its other members are Ian 
Dyson and Fru Hazlitt. All three members served on the Remuneration 
Committee throughout the year. Biographies of the Committee members 
can be found on pages 38 and 39. 
The Committee meets at least twice each year, and during the year  
under review met on eight occasions. Each member's attendance at these 
meetings is set out in the Corporate Governance report on page 45.  
The Committee received material assistance and advice from the 
Chairman, CEO and the Group Human Resources Director, although no 
individual is present for decisions relating to their personal remuneration.
During the year, a tender for consultancy services to the Remuneration 
Committee was carried out by the Committee and after careful 
consideration, New Bridge Street (NBS ) was appointed. While NBS, an 
Aon plc company, does not provide any other services to the Company, a 
separate subsidiary of Aon plc is the Group's appointed insurance broker. 
The Committee is however satisfied that the insurance services do not 
prejudice the independence of the remuneration advice provided to it  
by NBS. Prior to NBS's appointment, the Committee received advice  
from Kepler Associates. The Committee has also been advised by 
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP who are one of the Group's legal 
advisors and who have advised the Group on various legal matters. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP also acted in an advisory capacity to  
the Committee during the recruitment of our new Chief Executive.

Remuneration Policy
Betfair's remuneration is designed to provide a strong link to short and 
long-term performance through a simple and transparent framework.  
To attract, motivate and retain the highest calibre executives, the 
Company targets total fixed pay at around market levels, and incentive 
opportunities to allow executives to earn upper quartile levels of reward 
for upper quartile levels of performance. In determining the structure and 
quantum of senior executive remuneration, the Committee also takes 
into account pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group. 
The table below sets out the Committee's strategy and policy during the 
year and details changes envisaged going into the next financial year.

Betfair Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2012 The Committee considers that the Company's incentives are compatible 
with the Group's risk policies and systems, and is satisfied that the 
approach to setting the structure of remuneration packages for senior 
executives underpins an effective and proper management of risk; 
rewarding executives fairly for sustainable profit growth and long-term 
shareholder value creation, and delivering a significant proportion of 
executive remuneration in Betfair shares.
Departure of the CEO 
David Yu ceased to be employed by the Company as CEO and stepped 
down from the Board on 31 December 2011 before the expiry of his notice 
period on 31 October 2012. He received a cash payment of  429,167 in 
respect of the unexpired portion of his notice period. 
On 1 January 2012, David Yu took up a fixed term employment as an 
advisor to the Board of TVG, which represents Betfairs' interests in the US. 
He receives an annual salary of  43,000. The employment will terminate 
on 31 March 2013. He is entitled to continued medical, life and 
permanent health insurance until 31 March 2013 (or any later date on 
which any annual subscriptions to such insurance schemes expire). 
David Yu retains awards granted to him in 2009 and 2010 under the Long 
Term Incentive Plan although he agreed to surrender his 2011 award. The 
2009 and 2010 awards will vest in accordance with the rules of the plan at 
their normal vesting dates subject to the applicable performance targets. 
The number of shares that will vest will be reduced on a time pro-rata 
basis to reflect the cessation of his employment as CEO on 31 December 
2011. David Yu also retains vested and unvested share option awards 
under various of the Company's employee share plans which he may 
exercise in accordance with the rules of the relevant plans. Details of 
these awards are set out on pages 56 and 57 .
In addition to the above, David Yu is entitled to receive a cash payment in 
July 2012 in respect of the cash and share option elements of his 2011 
Short Term Incentive Plan award, pro-rated to reflect the termination of 
his employment as CEO on 31 December 2011). Details of the payment 
are set out on page 56). 
Interim CEO 
Stephen Morana, CFO, became Interim CEO on 1 January 2012 and in 
recognition of additional responsibilities his salary was temporarily 
increased from  412,000 to  512,000 per annum (i.e. the salary received 
by David Yu until his departure) until the new CEO joins the Company in 
August 2012. The Directors' remuneration table on page 56 details the 
how the temporary increase in salary has been calculated for bonus 
purposes. In addition to the temporary increase in base salary, 
Stephen Morana was granted a one-off award of 26,688 shares at nil-cost 
under the 2011 LTIP which is subject to the same performance conditions 
as the main 2011 LTIP award. Further information relating to the 
performance conditions can be found on page 54. The awards will vest no 
earlier than the third anniversary of grant subject to continued 
employment and the performance targets being met. 
Incoming CEO
The incoming CEO, Breon Corcoran, was a Board member at a competitor 
organisation and was selected after a rigorous search process led by the 
Nominations Committee, as outlined in the Nomination Committee on 
page 46. Breon Corcoran will join the Company and be appointed CEO on 
1 August 2012. He will be paid a basic salary of  515,000 per annum, with 
a payment in lieu of pension of 15% of basic salary per annum. Breon 
Corcoran will participate in the executive annual bonus plan as set out 
below, with a maximum opportunity of 180% of basic salary of which 
10% is payable against Personal performance and the remaining 170% 
against Company performance. One third of any award paid is deferred 
into Company shares with 50% vesting after 1 year and 50% vesting after 
2 years. The level of any bonus paid in respect of the 2012-13 financial 
year will be reduced pro-rata for the period of service in this year. 
In order to facilitate his recruitment from a major competitor organisation 
and to recognise and partly compensate for awards forfeited upon leaving 
his previous employer, Breon Corcoran will be granted the following share 
awards shortly after joining:
 which will vest in thirds on each of the first, second and third 
anniversaries of grant subject to continued employment.
 which vest on the third anniversary of grant subject to performance 
conditions and continued service. Performance conditions, which have 
yet to be finalised but which will be the same as those made to other 
senior executives under the 2012 LTIP award, will be set out within a 
Stock Exchange announcement which will be released shortly 
following grant.
It is anticipated that from 2013 onwards, Breon Corcoran will participate 
in the Group LTIP with an award level of 300% of basic salary annually. 
The Company will also pay certain relocation expenses in connection with 
Breon's move to the UK to take up this role.
The restricted shares and nil cost options above, which are non 
pensionable, will be granted pursuant to the authority contained in 
Listing Rule 9.4.2R(2) and full details of the awards as required by Listing 
Rule 9.4.3 will be disclosed in next year's Annual Report. In only partly 
compensating Breon Corcoran for awards forfeited upon leaving his 
previous employer and with a majority linked to the future performance 
of Betfair, the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the package 
agreed is appropriate in light of the candidate recruited and it is not 
paying any more than necessary to facilitate his recruitment.

Basic salary 
Basic salaries are normally reviewed annually and any changes are 
effective from 1 July each year. In reviewing salaries the Remuneration 
Committee takes into account pay and conditions elsewhere across the 
Group, relevant market data and benchmarking, and the individual 
Director's performance and experience. Benchmarking is carried out on a 
total remuneration basis, and takes account of pay levels for comparable 
roles at a range of organisations of similar size and sector. As at 1 July 
2011, Stephen Morana's underlying basic salary increased by 3% from 
 400,000 to  412,000, in line with general increases throughout the 
Group, as detailed in the table below.
  Salary at Salary effective % Increase applied

As previously stated, Stephen Morana was awarded a temporary increase 
in basic salary of  100,000 per annum whilst acting in the role of Interim 
CEO from 1 January 2012 (equating to  33,333 in the financial year under 
review). Therefore, as of 30 April 2012 together with his underlying basic

Annual Report and Accounts 2012 salary shown above he was remunerated at the rate of  512,000 per 
annum. The temporary increase will then cease upon Breon Corcoran's 
commencement on 1 August 2012.
Short-Term Incentive Plan 
For the year to 30 April 2012, Executive Directors continued to be eligible 
for a maximum STIP opportunity of 180% of salary. The STIP continued  
to reinforce our annual business strategy by incentivising profitable 
growth captured through Core Betfair Adjusted EBITDA and revenue. The 
Remuneration Committee is satisfied that EBITDA and revenue are the 
best measures of short-term financial performance for Betfair. The use  
of revenue aligns with our strategic objectives of widening the range of 
products and services that we offer, attracting new customers, increasing 
the activity of existing customers, and building our market share in all 
regions in which we operate. Rewarding EBITDA alongside revenue helps 
ensure a balance between growth and profitability. Up to 85% of salary 
was available for meeting the maximum targets under each financial 
measure. In order to incentivise and reward wider aspects of business 
performance, and capture lead measures, an element based on individual 
performance was introduced for the STIP during FY12. Executive Directors 
were eligible to earn up to 10% of salary for achieving specific and 
measurable individual objectives. Two thirds of any STIP payment is 
delivered in cash, with the remaining one third deferred into Betfair Group 
shares. Deferred shares vest 50% after 1 year and 50% after 2 years from 
the date of grant, subject to continued employment. Details of the STIP 
awards are set out in the Directors' remuneration table below.
The STIP arrangements for FY13 will be similar to those operated for FY12. 
However, the Committee will be seeking to separate the STIP into its 
component parts of a cash bonus plan and deferred share arrangement 
and as the deferred share arrangement will contain the flexibility to use 
new issue shares, shareholder approval for the plan will be sought at the 
forthcoming AGM. Further details of the deferred share arrangement are 
set out in the Notice of AGM. While there will be no change in the 180% 
maximum bonus available to the participants or the level of share deferral 
operated, the new plans will allow the Committee to introduce a 
clawback clause, dividend roll-up provision and other changes to simplify 
the arrangements and better align them with best and market practice.
Long-Term Incentive Plan 
The Remuneration Committee believes that it is important to provide 
share incentives to Executive Directors and senior management to  
align their long-term interests with those of Betfair's shareholders.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) provides for awards of both 
fair-market value options and nil-cost options to senior executives 
(including Executive Directors). Historically award sizes have been 
determined based on a number of options rather than as a fixed multiple 
of salary. Options will normally vest no earlier than the third anniversary 
of grant, and be subject to the achievement of performance conditions 
set over three years.
As described last year, the Committee determined that for 2011-2012, the 
balance of LTIP awards shifted from fair market value options towards 
nil-cost options, while the overall fair value remained broadly unchanged.
During the year the CEO, David Yu (prior to him stepping down) and Chief 
Financial Officer, Stephen Morana were conditionally each awarded 
45,000 and 39,000 fair market value options respectively, as well as 
45,000 and 39,000 respectively nil-cost options. These options will 
normally vest on the third anniversary of grant and are subject to two 
corporate financial performance conditions. The extent to which awards 
vest depends 50.0% on the Group's EPS growth and 50.0% on the Group's 
revenue growth. Revenue targets are set as   million amounts for the 
financial year ending 30 April 2014. Vesting occurs on a sliding scale, with 
no vesting under 86.5% of the target and full vesting only if 120.0% of 
target is reached. 
As reported last year, the Committee introduced EPS as an additional 
measure to improve alignment with shareholders, and better reflect 
market practice at FTSE-listed companies. Revenue remained as the other 
measure to reinforce our growth strategy. The EPS targets for the 2011 
award are:
  Threshold Target Max
Group - EPS  49.0p 56.6p 67.9p
% of award vesting  0% 66.7% 100%
To the extent that the performance targets are not met over the 
performance period, awards will lapse, i.e. there will be no re-testing of 
performance conditions. In the event of a change of control, vesting of 
options is not automatic and would depend on the extent to which the 
performance conditions had been met at the time, and the period elapsed 
since the date of grant.
For the 2012 LTIP award, and as described earlier in the table on page 52, 
the Committee is proposing to introduce a third measure for the LTIP, 
being Relative TSR against a specific comparator group composed of 
similar gaming organisations. The awards made will vest 50% against  
the Relative TSR measure, 25% against Group EPS and 25% against Core 
Betfair Revenue. The associated targets, which have yet to be finalised, 
will be set out within a stock exchange announcement which will be 
released shortly following grant.
The Committee will also be moving to granting LTIP awards as a multiple 
of salary rather than a fixed number of shares from 2012 onwards, and 
continuing the process started in 2011, as of 2012, awards will be made 
solely over nil-cost options. In addition, consistent with the deferred 
share arrangement, the Committee will seek shareholder approval at the 
2012 AGM to introduce a dividend roll-up, add clawback and tidy up a 
number of provisions to aid the administration of the plan. Further details 
of the proposed amendments are set out in the Notice of AGM.
All-employee share schemes 
The Group operates an HMRC-approved SAYE scheme, in which all UK 
employees including Executive Directors may participate. Participants 
can save up to  250 per month for three years and then use these savings 
to buy shares in the Group at a 20% discount to the market value at the 
start of the savings period. During 2011/12 an offer was made available  
to eligible employees with savings commencing in December 2011.
Share Option Plan 
The 2009 Unapproved Option Plan allows executives to be granted 
fair-market value options vesting subject only to continued employment. 
This plan is only used to attract and recruit new employees to the 
Company, and the Committee does not intend to make further awards to 
the current Executive Directors.
Other long-term incentive plans 
Executive Directors also hold awards under other incentive plans 
operated prior to Admission. Any applicable performance conditions  
on these awards have now been met. The Committee does not currently 
intend to make any further awards to Executive Directors under these 
plans.
Further details on share awards made during the year to 30 April 2012 can 
be found at page 56.
Dilution 
The Group's share schemes are funded through a combination of shares 
purchased in the market and new issue shares. Funding of awards through 
new issue shares is subject to an overall dilution limit of 10% of issued 
share capital in any 10 year period.

Betfair Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pension contributions 
Executive Directors are entitled to a Company pension contribution  
of 10% of basic salary into the Group's Personal Pension Plan (GPPP ) 
which is a defined contribution scheme open to all employees. As  
an alternative, Executive Directors may choose to take the amount as a 
cash supplement. As noted previously, Breon Corcoran will be entitled  
to a 15% pension contribution from appointment.
Other benefits 
Benefits in kind for Executive Directors relate to life assurance, private 
medical care and critical illness cover. There is currently no car or car 
allowance policy. 
Executive Director service contracts
The Remuneration Committee's policy is to provide service contracts for 
Executive Directors with notice periods of 12 months or less. Stephen 
Morana entered into a service agreement with the Group dated 27 July 
2010, which is subject to 12 months' notice by either party. Upon 
Admission, the required notice period increased to 24 months, reducing 
by one month on the 1st of the month following Admission and the 1st of 
each month thereafter until the first anniversary of Admission, so that the 
period of notice required to be given by either party at any time on or 
after the first anniversary of Admission is 12 months. Upon termination, 
Executive Directors are entitled to salary for the duration of their notice 
period. It is the Remuneration Committee's policy to seek to mitigate 
such payments. Details of Breon Corcoran's service agreement will be 
disclosed in next year's remuneration report and will be available for 
inspection at the Company's registered office and at the AGM. 
External Directorships for Executive Directors
At the discretion of the Board, an executive director may be appointed as 
a Non-executive Director at one other company. Before granting 
permission the Board will take into account, inter alia, the time 
commitment of the new role, any potential conflicts, the Listing Rules and 
the Code. During the year, Stephen Morana was a Non-executive Director 
of Featurespace Limited. He did not receive any fees in respect of this role. 
Betfair has a non-controlling interest in Featurespace Limited.
Non-executive Directors (NEDs ) 
All NEDs' services are provided for under the terms of a letter of 
appointment with the Group, and are subject to annual re-election with 
one month's notice by either party. Details of the terms of the 
appointment of the current NEDs are as follows:
