 48 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
During the year the new strategy was unveiled coupled with  
a significant restructure of the business and the Remuneration 
Committee has also been mindful of the speed with which the  
new Executive Team has been able to implement these changes. 
The Remuneration Committee has worked hard to continue  
to develop our remuneration policy, and thereby improve the 
alignment with both the Company's short and long-term  
strategy and best market practice.
While there have been no significant changes to the remuneration 
policy, during the course of the year we have simplified the bonus 
structure and brought the terms of our LTIP in line with market 
practice, as approved at the AGM in 2012. As disclosed at the 
time of his award, we have provided specific recruitment terms 
for the incoming Chief Executive. The Committee also dealt with 
the departure of the interim CEO and the recruitment of a new 
CFO during the year.
A summary of the main topics discussed at the Committee 
meetings during the year can be found below. 
I hope that you will support the Directors' Remuneration  
Report resolution which will be put to the forthcoming AGM.

The Remuneration Committee currently comprises three 
independent Non-Executive Directors, in compliance with the 
Code. The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Mike McTighe, 
and its other members are Ian Dyson and Fru Hazlitt. All three 
members served on the Remuneration Committee throughout 
the year. Biographies of the Committee members can be found 
on pages 30 and 31. 
The Committee meets at least twice each year, and during  
the year under review met on eight occasions. Each member's 
attendance at these meetings is set out in the Corporate 
Governance report on page 38. The Committee received material 
assistance and advice from the Chairman, CEO and the Group 
Human Resources Director, although no individual is present for 
decisions relating to their personal remuneration.
The Committee has been advised during the year by New  
Bridge Street (NBS) and by Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP 
(Freshfields). NBS is a separate subsidiary of the Group's insurance 
broker Aon plc (and it does not provide any other services to  
the Company). Freshfields are one of the Group's legal advisors 
and have advised the Group on various legal matters.
Remuneration policy
Betfair's remuneration is designed to provide a strong link  
to short and long-term performance through a simple and 
transparent framework. To attract, motivate and retain the 
highest calibre executives, the Company targets total fixed pay  
at around market levels, and incentive opportunities to allow 
executives to earn upper quartile levels of reward for upper 
quartile levels of performance. In determining the structure and 
quantum of senior executive remuneration, the Committee also 
takes into account pay and employment conditions elsewhere in 
the Group. The table below sets out the Committee's strategy 
and policy during the year and details changes envisaged going 
into the next financial year.
Elements of remuneration
Element Objective FY13 policy FY14 policy
Base salary  
(see page 50)
Reflect size and nature of role, 
individual experience and 
performance.
Determined taking into 
account market data for 
comparable positions at 
companies of similar sector 
and size to Betfair.
No change.
Short-Term Incentive Plan 
(STIP) 
(see page 50)
Incentivise delivery of Betfair's 
business strategy by rewarding 
profit and revenue targets and 
each executive's contribution  
to Group success.
A maximum opportunity of up 
to 180% of salary.
Deferred Shares awarded as 
part of the Annual Bonus plan 
will be awarded under the 
Deferred Share Incentive Plan 
as approved at the 2012 AGM. 
Up to 10% of salary is payable 
against personal performance.
The personal performance 
element is to increase to 20%  
of salary (out of 180% 
maximum opportunity).
The remaining 170% of  
salary is based on Core  
Betfair underlying EBITDA  
and revenue.
2/3rds of any amount earned 
is paid in cash and 1/3rd in 
shares, vesting in equal 
tranches after 1 and 2 years 
from date of grant.
Following the Group's 
restructuring efforts of recent 
times, the emphasis for the 
Company will be moved to 
Revenue, with 60% of the 
opportunity against financial 
measures being based on 
Group Revenue and 40% 
against Group Underlying 
EBITDA.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
(see pages 51 and 53)
Incentivise senior executives  
to create long-term  
shareholder value.
Align the interests of senior 
executives with those  
of shareholders.
Awards over shares, vesting 
after 3 years based 50% on 
Relative Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR), 25% on Revenue 
performance and 25% on EPS.
The Committee has proposed 
that the same three measures 
will be used for the 2013 
award, although the weighting 
will be adjusted to 25% on 
Relative TSR, 25% on Revenue 
performance and 50% on EPS.
Pension 
(see page 54)
Provide competitive total  
fixed pay.
Company contributions of 15% 
of salary for the CEO, and 10% 
for the CFO (or an equivalent 
cash payment in lieu).
No change.
The Committee considers that the Company's incentives  
are compatible with the Group's risk policies and systems,  
and is satisfied that the approach to setting the structure  
of remuneration packages for senior executives underpins  
an effective and proper management of risk; rewarding  
executives fairly for sustainable profit growth and long-term 
shareholder value creation, and delivering a significant proportion 
of executive remuneration in Betfair shares. 50 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Re Mun e RAt ion Repo Rt Departure of the Interim CEO 
During a period of transition, Stephen Morana stepped down  
as Interim CEO on 1 August 2012 (when Breon Corcoran became 
CEO) and continued to be employed by the Company as CFO  
until 3 December 2012 (when Alex Gersh became CFO) when  
he stepped down from the Board. He ceased to be employed  
by the Company on 31 March 2013 and then received a cash 
payment of  422,300 in respect of his notice period and  17,866  
in respect of untaken holiday.
Stephen Morana retains awards granted to him in 2010 and  
2011 under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. The awards will vest  
in accordance with the rules of the plan at their normal vesting 
dates subject to the applicable performance targets. The number 
of shares that will vest will be reduced on a time pro-rata basis. 
Stephen Morana also retains vested and unvested share option 
awards under various Company employee share plans which he 
may exercise in accordance with the rules of the relevant plans. 
Details of these awards are set out on pages 55 and 56.
In addition to the above, Stephen Morana is entitled to receive  
a cash payment in July 2013 in respect of the cash element  
only of his 2013 Short-Term Incentive Plan award, pro-rated  
to reflect the termination of his employment on 31 March 2013. 
Details of the payment are set out on page 54. 
New CEO Breon Corcoran
Breon Corcoran took up the role of CEO on 1 August 2012 and 
the terms of his remuneration upon appointment were detailed  
in last year's report and, to the extent they were awarded or paid 
during the most recent financial year, are set out in the relevant 
sections of this report. The level of any bonus paid in respect  
of the 2012-2013 financial year will reflect the period of service  
in this year.
New CFO Alexander Gersh
The new CFO, Alex Gersh was selected after a rigorous search 
process led by the Nomination Committee, as outlined in the 
Nomination Committee on page 41. Alex Gersh joined the 
Company and was appointed CFO on 3 December 2012.  
He is paid a basic salary of  400,000 per annum, with a 
Company contribution to his pension fund of 10% of basic salary. 
Alex Gersh participates in the executive annual bonus plan as set 
out below, with a maximum opportunity of 180% of basic salary. 
One third of any award paid is deferred into Company shares 
with 50% vesting after 1 year and 50% vesting after 2 years. 
The level of any bonus paid in respect of the 2012-2013 financial 
year will be reduced pro-rata for the period of service in this year. 
In order to facilitate his recruitment, upon commencement  
Alex Gersh received a share award, with terms similar to the  
2012 LTIP award. This award consisted of nil cost options over 
108,788 of the Company's shares (whose face value equalled 
200% of Alex's salary at the date of grant) which vest on the  
third anniversary of grant subject to performance conditions and 
continued service. Performance conditions, which are the same 
as those made to other senior executives under the 2012 LTIP 
award, and are set out on pages 51 and 52.
The nil cost options above, which are non pensionable, have  
been granted pursuant to the authority contained in Listing Rule 
9.4.2R(2) and full details of the awards as required by Listing  
Rule 9.4.3 are disclosed in this Annual Report. The Remuneration 
Committee is satisfied that the package agreed is appropriate  
for the candidate recruited and it is not paying any more than 
necessary to facilitate his recruitment. 
It is anticipated that from 2013 onwards, Alex Gersh will  
participate in the Group LTIP with an award level of 200%  
of basic salary annually.
Executive Director pay mix FY13

of the expected on-going annual package for Executive Directors,

Basic salary 
Basic salaries are normally reviewed annually and any changes  
are effective from 1 July each year. In reviewing salaries the 
Remuneration Committee takes into account pay and conditions 
elsewhere across the Group, relevant market data and 
benchmarking, and the individual Director's performance and 
experience. Benchmarking is carried out on a total remuneration 
basis, and takes account of pay levels for comparable roles at a 
range of organisations of similar size and sector. As at 30 April 
2013, neither Breon Corcoran's nor Alex Gersh's basic salary has 
increased since their appointment and remained at  515,000 and 
 400,000 respectively. The general level of pay review in the 
business has been set at a 2.5% budget for FY14 and it is the 
intention to apply the same level of budget to the Executive Team.
As disclosed last year, Stephen Morana was awarded a temporary 
increase of  100,000 per annum applied to his underlying  
basic salary whilst acting in the role of Interim CEO (equating  
to  25,000 in the financial year under review). His underlying  
basic salary was increased on 1 July 2012 by 2.5% in line with 
general increases throughout the Group. The temporary increase 
ceased upon Breon Corcoran's commencement on 1 August 2012 
and Stephen Morana reverted to his basic salary of  422,300. 51  corporate.betfair.com/investor-relations/annual-reports
Short-Term Incentive Plan 
For the year to 30 April 2013, Executive Directors continued  
to be eligible for a maximum STIP opportunity of 180% of salary. 
The STIP reinforces our annual business strategy by incentivising 
profitable growth captured through Core Betfair Underlying 
EBITDA and revenue. The Remuneration Committee is satisfied 
that EBITDA and revenue are the best measures of short-term 
financial performance for Betfair. The use of revenue aligns with 
our strategic objectives of widening the range of products and 
services that we offer, attracting new customers, increasing the 
activity of existing customers, and building our market share in  
all regions in which we operate. Rewarding EBITDA alongside 
revenue helps ensure a balance between growth and profitability. 
Up to 85% of salary was available for meeting the maximum 
targets under each financial measure. In order to incentivise and 
reward wider aspects of business performance, and capture lead 
measures, an element based on individual performance was 
introduced for the STIP during FY12. Executive Directors were 
eligible to earn up to 10% of salary for achieving specific and 
measurable individual objectives. Two-thirds of any STIP payment 
is delivered in cash, with the remaining one third deferred into 
Betfair Group shares. Deferred shares vest 50% after 1 year and 
50% after 2 years from the date of grant, subject to continued 
employment. Details of the STIP awards are set out in the 
Directors' remuneration table below.
The STIP arrangements for FY14 will be similar to those operated  
for FY13. However, following shareholder approval at the 2012 
AGM, the Committee has separated the STIP into its component 
parts of a cash bonus plan and deferred share arrangement  
and the deferred share arrangement will contain the flexibility  
to use new issue shares. While there is no change in the 180% 
maximum bonus available to the participants or the level of  
share deferral operated, the new plans allow the Committee to 
introduce a clawback clause, dividend roll-up provision and other 
changes to simplify the arrangements and better align them with 
best and market practice. Any future significant amendments  
to share plans would similarly be referred to shareholders.
The Committee has reviewed the measures for FY14 and is 
satisfied that overall they continue to remain the most relevant 
metrics aligned to the corporate strategy. However, out of the 
180% maximum opportunity, the personal performance element 
is to increase from 10% to 20% of salary and of the opportunity 
against financial measures 96% will be based on Group Revenue 
and 64% against Group Underlying EBITDA.
When agreeing bonus awards this year, the Committee has 
recognised the new strategy put in place by the Executive Team 
and that the transition has been achieved with more pace than had 
been envisaged. In particular the positive impact of driving cost 
savings and efficiency coupled with more resilience in revenue from 
non-regulated markets, as detailed elsewhere in this report, has been 
taken into account. The bonuses awarded are detailed on page 54.
Long-Term Incentive Plan 
The Remuneration Committee believes that it is important  
to provide share incentives to Executive Directors and senior 
management to align their long-term interests with those  
of Betfair's shareholders.
The Committee has moved to granting LTIP awards as a multiple  
of salary, rather than a fixed number of shares, 300% for the 
CEO and 200% for the CFO. Continuing the process started  
in 2011, awards in 2012 were made solely over nil-cost options.  
In addition, the Committee received shareholder approval at  
the 2012 AGM to introduce a dividend roll-up, add clawback  
and amend a number of provisions to aid the administration  
of the plan which are consistent with the deferred share 
arrangement. Any future significant amendments to share  
plans would similarly be referred to shareholders.
For the 2012 LTIP award the Committee introduced a third 
measure for the LTIP, being Relative TSR against a specific 
comparator group composed of similar gaming organisations. 
The awards made will vest 50% against the Relative TSR 
measure, 25% against Group EPS and 25% against Core Betfair 
Revenue. The Committee introduced TSR as an additional 
measure to improve alignment with shareholders, and better 
reflect market practice at FTSE-listed companies. EPS  
and Revenue remained as the other measures to reinforce  
our growth strategy and focus on profitability.
The joining awards of performance-based shares for the CEO 
and CFO described elsewhere in this report are measured  
on the same conditions as those of the 2012 LTIP.
The targets for the 2012 award are:
TSR Target (50% of award):
For the 2012 awards, the Remuneration Committee has agreed 
that appropriate TSR comparators over a three year performance 
period are: Bwin.party digital entertainment plc, Ladbrokes plc, 
Playtech Limited, Paddy Power plc, Rank Group plc, Sportingbet 
plc, Unibet, William Hill plc and 888 Holdings plc. In order for 
this part of the award to vest, Betfair must achieve performance 
as illustrated below:
Betfair's TSR against the TSR of 
members of the comparator group
% of the relevant part of the award 
that vests (subject to the Relative  
TSR performance condition)
Upper quartile 100%
Between median  
and upper quartile
25%-100%  
(straight-line basis)
Median 25%
Below median 0%
EPS Target (25% of award):

the year ended 30 April 2015
% of the relevant part of the award 
that vests (subject to the Group 
EPS performance condition)
60.9 pence 100%
Between 50.3 pence  
and 60.9 pence

N.B. EPS of 50.3 pence and 60.9 pence in 2015 is equivalent to threshold and 
maximum growth rates of 7% compound p.a. and 14% compound p.a. 
respectively.
Core Revenue Target (25% of award):

and maximum growth rates of 5% compound p.a. and 12.5% compound p.a. 
respectively.  52 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
g o ve Rn Ance
Re Mun e RAt ion Repo Rt In respect of both the EPS and Core Revenue targets, the 
Committee retains the discretion to adjust the performance 
outturn to reflect changes to accounting policy since the grant  
of the award and for material changes to the Board's assessment 
of the regulatory environment within which the Group operates. 
To the extent that the performance targets are not met over  
the performance period, awards will lapse, i.e. there will be  
no re-testing of performance conditions. In the event of a change 
of control, vesting of options is subject to the discretion of  
the Committee.
Having reviewed the measures to be used for the 2013 Awards,  
the Committee has proposed that the same three measures will  
be used, although the weighting will be adjusted to 25% on 
Relative TSR, 25% on Revenue performance and 50% on EPS. 
The corresponding targets will be disclosed in next year's report.
All-employee share schemes 
The Group operates an HMRC approved SAYE scheme, in which 
all UK employees including Executive Directors may participate. 
Participants can save up to  250 per month for three years and 
then use these savings to buy shares in the Group at a 20% 
discount to the market value at the start of the savings period. 
During the year reported, no such offer was made to employees  
but the Company has already committed to a further offer being 
made in FY14.
Share Option Plan 
The 2009 Unapproved Option Plan allows Executives to be  
granted fair-market value options vesting subject only to continued 
employment. This plan is only used to attract and recruit new 
employees to the Company, and the Committee does not intend  
to make further awards to the current Executive Directors.
Other long-term incentive plans 
Stephen Morana also holds awards under other incentive plans 
operated prior to Admission. Any applicable performance 
conditions on these awards have now been met. The Committee 
does not currently intend to make any further awards to 
Executive Directors under these plans.
Further details on these awards can be found at page 56.
Dilution 
The Group's share schemes are funded through a combination  
of shares purchased in the market and new issue shares. Funding  
of awards through new issue shares is subject to an overall dilution 
limit of 10% of issued share capital in any 10 year period.
Pension contributions 
The CEO is entitled to a Company pension contribution of 15%  
of basic salary into the Group's Personal Pension Plan (GPPP) 
which is a defined contribution scheme open to all employees. 
The CFO is entitled to a 10% contribution to the same scheme. 
As an alternative, Executive Directors may choose to take  
the amount as a cash supplement and the CEO has made such  
an election.
Other benefits 
Benefits in kind for Executive Directors relate to life assurance, 
private medical care, income protection and critical illness cover  
and in the case of Breon Corcoran for the reported year, 
assistance with his relocation from Ireland to London.  
There is currently no car or car allowance policy. 
Non-Executive Directors 
All Non-Executive Directors' services are provided for under the 
terms of a letter of appointment with the Group, and are subject 
to annual re-election with one month's notice by either party 
(except for the Chairman with three month's notice by either 
party). Details of the terms of the appointment of the current 
Non-Executive Directors are as follows:

*  Please see Non-Executive Directors' profiles for total service on pages 30  
and 31.
Executive Director service contracts
The Remuneration Committee's policy is to provide service 
contracts for Executive Directors with notice periods of  
12 months or less. Both Executive Directors are subject to  
12 months' notice by either party. Upon termination, Executive 
Directors are entitled to salary for the duration of their notice 
period. It is the Remuneration Committee's policy to seek  
to mitigate such payments. The Executive Directors' service 
agreements and letters of engagement for Non-Executive 
Directors will be available for inspection at the AGM. 
External Directorships for Executive Directors 
At the discretion of the Board, an Executive Director may be 
appointed as a Non-Executive Director at one other company. 
Before granting permission the Board will take into account,  
inter alia, the time commitment of the new role, any potential 
conflicts, the Listing Rules and the Code. The two Executive 
Directors, Breon Corcoran and Alex Gersh, do not have any 
external directorships. 
Non-Executive Directors' fees
The fees paid to Non-Executive Directors, excluding  
the Chairman of the Board, are determined by the Board,  
on recommendation of the Executive Directors, and are set  
out in individual letters of appointment. The Chairman's fee  
is determined by the Remuneration Committee. For the year 
ended 30 April 2013, fees remain unchanged from the prior year.  53  corporate.betfair.com/investor-relations/annual-reports
