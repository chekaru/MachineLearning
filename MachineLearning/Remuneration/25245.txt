DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT: 
ANNUAL STATEMENT
Leo Quinn, 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
On behalf of the Board, I welcome the opportunity to present 
the Remuneration Committee's report on Directors' remuneration 
for FY14, my first report following my appointment to chair the 
Remuneration Committee in April 2014. 
The new regulations governing the disclosure and approval 
of Directors' remuneration require the Remuneration Report 
to be split into three parts: (i) this Annual Statement; (ii) the 
Remuneration Policy Report which will be subject to a binding 
shareholder resolution at the forthcoming AGM; and (iii) the 
Annual Report on Remuneration which will be put to an 
advisory shareholder resolution at the same AGM.
Remuneration principles
Betfair's remuneration policy as detailed on pages 53 to 58 is 
based on the following principles, which are reviewed periodically 
to ensure they continue to remain appropriate and support the 
Company's evolving strategy. The principles of our remuneration 
policy remain unchanged from previous years.
Betfair's remuneration principles and primary objectives
MARKET COMPETITIVE 
LEVELS
  Designed to attract, retain and motivate Executives of the highest calibre by targeting fixed pay around 
market levels and providing the opportunity to earn above market remuneration through the performance-
related elements.
PAY FOR 
PERFORMANCE AND 
STRATEGIC LINK
  The remuneration package should be weighted heavily towards variable pay.
  The variable pay elements will be based on metrics which are consistent with delivering the Board's  
strategic objectives. A clear link between reward and individual and corporate performance delivered  
should be established.
SHAREHOLDER 
ALIGNMENT
  The performance targets applying to the short and long-term incentives will be set so as to align the interests 
of Executives with those of shareholders.
  A significant proportion of reward should be share based with shareholding guidelines encouraging 
Executives to build and maintain significant shareholdings.
  The Committee will seek to reward sustained long-term performance.
HIGH LEVELS  
OF CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE 
AND ENGAGEMENT
  The Committee is regularly updated on corporate governance and institutional investor best practice 
developments, and takes account of this when setting remuneration policy.
  The Committee maintains an open and transparent dialogue with shareholders throughout the year.
50 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 The Committee's responsibilities
During the year, the Committee refreshed its terms of  
reference (which can be found on the Company's website -  
corporate.betfair.com/about-us/governance/committees.aspx). 
The Committee's principle responsibilities include:
  Determining the framework or broad policy for the 
remuneration of the Chairman, the Executive Directors, 
the CEO's direct reports and the Company Secretary. 
  Setting, approving and reviewing the approach to the 
remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors and other 
senior executives, covering salary, bonus, pension, benefits and 
long-term incentive share awards. In determining the 
remuneration of senior executives the Committee takes into 
account remuneration trends across the Company.
  Setting appropriate and challenging performance-related criteria 
attached to the variable elements of remuneration and 
considering the long-term business strategy.
  Reviewing, recommending and approving the rules of any 
share-based incentive operated by the Company.
Performance outcome for FY14
For Executive Directors, the FY14 Annual Bonus was based on 
financial metrics (160% of salary in total) and personal objectives 
(20% of salary). The financial metrics were Group Revenue and 
EBITDA, weighted 60% in favour of Revenue and 40% towards 
EBITDA. The Company performed well against its financial targets 
and a description of the Company's performance is included in the 
Financial Review on pages 21 to 24. 
Against the target set at the start of the year, both Revenue and 
EBITDA outcomes were above Target but below the Maximum. 
This performance resulted in 114.27% salary being payable in 
respect of the financial objectives. Including the personal element, 
bonuses of 132.26% of salary were awarded to Executive 
Directors. The Committee is satisfied that this level of bonus 
reflects the financial and personal performance delivered during 
the year. In line with the Company's policy, a significant proportion 
of the bonus is deferred in shares.
The CEO and CFO had no performance-based long-term incentive 
awards due to vest in the financial year being reported on 
(or shortly after) the year end reflecting the relatively short tenure 
of the current Executive Team. The Executive Directors' first 
long-term performance-based awards will vest based on 
performance to 30 April 2015.
Remuneration policy for FY15
In line with the remuneration philosophy outlined earlier, the 
Committee is committed to ensuring that rewards for Executives 
are closely aligned to the interests of shareholders through having 
all incentive arrangements linked to challenging performance 
targets, focused on growing earnings and generating high levels 
of shareholder return. 
The Committee is not proposing any significant changes to 
remuneration at this time and believes the current remuneration 
structure and variable pay quantum remain appropriate for Betfair. 
The Committee took into account the following factors in 
determining the approach for FY15:
  As a Committee we are aware of calls for continued pay 
restraint and the salary increase for the CEO will be 3%, 
in line with those awarded to the workforce more generally. 
No increase will be applied to the CFO's salary. 
  Annual incentive and Long Term Incentive Plan opportunities 
remain unchanged from the year under review. The Committee 
continues to believe that the current arrangements do not 
inadvertently encourage undue risk taking given the clear 
long-term focus in our policy. 
  In light of the significant challenge facing the industry to 
mitigate the impact of new gaming taxes on profitability, the 
Committee is proposing that a slight amendment is made to  
the Annual Bonus plan with an equal 50/50 emphasis placed  
on Group Revenue and Group EBITDA for the FY15 bonus.  
A 60/40 Group Revenue/Group EBITDA weighting was  
applied in FY14.
  The operation of a Long Term Incentive Plan and deferral into 
shares for part of the annual incentive ensures that Executives 
are clearly aligned with the long-term objectives of the 
Company and its shareholders. Given the increasing strength 
of view on long-term alignment of Executives with shareholders 
and developments in the market, we have introduced formal 
guidelines on the building up of shareholdings by Executive 
Directors over a period of five years. 
We have provided a summary of FY14 remuneration following 
this statement and before the Remuneration Policy Report. The 
summary sets out performance and remuneration outcomes for 
the year ended 30 April 2014. More detail can be found in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration which starts on page 59.
Shareholder feedback
The Remuneration Committee encourages dialogue with the 
Company's shareholders and will consult with major shareholders 
ahead of any significant future changes to the remuneration policy. 
We were delighted that the 2013 Remuneration Report received 
a 95.38% vote in favour at the last AGM. 
We look forward to your continued support of our remuneration 
policy at the 2014 AGM.

BASE SALARY
The CEO's salary will be increased by 3% from 1 July 2014, which is in line with the general increase across the 
workforce. The CFO's salary will remain unchanged. 
Salaries for FY15 are:
  CEO -  530,450
  CFO -  400,000
BENEFITS AND 
PENSION
No change proposed. Pension contribution of 15% of salary for the CEO and 10% of salary for the CFO.
ANNUAL BONUS  
(UNDER THE ANNUAL 
CASH INCENTIVE PLAN/
DEFERRED SHARE 
INCENTIVE PLAN)
No change to potential quantum - 180% of salary.
A slight rebalancing of the financial performance metrics is proposed: 
   80% of salary will be based on Group EBITDA; 
   80% of salary on Group Revenue; and 
   20% on personal objectives.
The rebalancing to an equal weighting on EBITDA and Revenue reflects the focus on mitigating the impact on 
profitability of significant cost increases arising from the introduction of new gaming taxes.
LONG TERM 
INCENTIVES (UNDER 
THE LTIP)
No change to quantum or metrics - 300% of salary for the CEO and 200% of salary for the CFO, with 50% 
based on EPS growth, 25% on relative TSR against the FTSE 250, excluding Investment Trusts, and 25% on 
Group Revenue (based on FY17).

DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT:
2014 REMUNERATION SUMMARY
52 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Introduction
The contents of this Policy Report set out the Group's policy 
and disclosures in relation to Directors' remuneration for the year 
ended 30 April 2014. The report has been presented on behalf 
of the Board and complies fully with the Listing Rules, the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 and the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2010 and 2012 (the  Code') as applicable for the financial year.
The Policy Report will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the 
2014 AGM and, subject to the Policy Report receiving majority 
shareholder support, will operate from an effective date of the 
date of the AGM, 4 September 2014. In practice, the Committee 
intends to apply the policy detailed in the Policy Report to the 
current financial year and throughout the three year policy 
period from the effective date. The remainder of the Directors' 
Remuneration Report which includes the Annual Report on 
Remuneration will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at 
the 2014 AGM. 
Remuneration Policy Report
The Committee determines the remuneration policy for the 
Executive Directors, the Chairman, Company Secretary and 
other designated members of Executive Management. The 
overall policy aim is to provide a remuneration package which 
will attract, retain and motivate high calibre Executives with 
the appropriate expertise. 
The Committee believes that the opportunity to earn superior 
rewards should be directly aligned to the successful delivery of 
short and long-term performance through a simple and transparent 
framework. The remuneration package for Executive Directors is 
weighted towards performance-related pay, with the aim to pay 
around mid-market levels of total fixed pay but with the opportunity 
to earn upper quartile levels of reward for delivering superior 
performance. The Committee regularly reviews the variable 
incentive elements of the policy to ensure they do not encourage 
excessive risk taking and that they operate within an overall 
acceptable risk profile. 
When setting the policy for Executive Directors' remuneration, the 
Committee takes into account total remuneration levels operating 
in companies of a similar size and complexity, the responsibilities 
of each individual role, individual performance and an individual's 
experience. The Committee also considers developments in best 
practice and the pay and employment conditions within the 
wider Group. 
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors
The policy table below sets out the key elements of Betfair's Executive Director Remuneration, how they are linked to the Company's 
strategy, how they operate, the framework for setting performance measures (if applicable) and maximum opportunity levels. 
SALARY
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and performance measures Maximum opportunity
   To attract and retain high 
calibre individuals
   Provides an appropriate 
level of basic fixed income 
whilst avoiding excessive risk 
arising from over-reliance on 
variable income
   Generally reviewed annually (with any change effective 1 July) 
but exceptionally at other times of the year
   Set with reference to individual skills, experience, 
responsibilities, Company performance and performance in role
   Independent benchmarking is conducted on a periodic basis 
against companies of a similar size, complexity and operating 
in the same sector, although this information is only used as 
part of a broader review
   The current salaries are shown in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration
   No maximum applies. However, 
increases, as a percentage of salary, 
will generally be consistent with 
those offered to the wider workforce 
from time to time 
   Higher increases may be appropriate 
where an individual changes role, 
there is a material change in the 
responsibilities of the role, where an 
individual is appointed on a below 
market salary with the expectation 
that this salary will increase with 
experience and performance, or 
where salaries, in the opinion of the 
Committee, have fallen materially 
below the relevant market rates
PENSION
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and performance measures Maximum opportunity
   To aid retention by providing 
a cost-effective long-term 
retirement benefit
  Paid as a defined contribution and/or a cash supplement    Contribution of up to 15% of salary 
(or an equivalent cash payment in lieu)

Committee discretions relating to variable pay schemes
The Committee will operate the ACIP, DSIP and LTIP according 
to their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules 
where relevant. The Committee retains discretion, consistent 
with market practice, in a number of regards to the operation 
and administration of these plans. 
These include, but are not limited to, the following:
  who participates in the plan;
  the timing of grant of an award and/or payment;
  the size of an award (subject to the maxima set out in the 
policy table above);
  the determination of vesting; 
  discretion required when dealing with a change of control or 
restructuring of the Group;
  determination of a good/bad leaver for incentive plan purposes 
based on the rules of the plan and the appropriate treatment 
chosen;
  confirming that the calculation of performance (including any 
adjustments that were required to be made) is made in an 
appropriate manner, with due consideration of whether, 
and if so, how, adjustments should be made for any changes 
to accounting policy over the performance period. Any 
adjustments to the performance targets should result in the 
revised target not being any less challenging than the original 
target set;
  adjustments required in special circumstances (e.g. rights issues, 
corporate restructuring, events and special dividends); and
  the choice of performance measures and targets for a new 
award under each incentive plan in accordance with the policy 
set out above.
In relation to both the Annual Bonus and LTIP, the Committee 
retains the ability to adjust the targets set if events occur - for 
example, material changes to the Board's assessment of the 
regulatory environment within which the Group operates, or a 
material acquisition and/or divestment of a Group business - 
which cause the Committee to determine that the conditions 
are no longer appropriate and the amendment is required so that 
the conditions achieve their original purpose and are not materially 
less difficult to satisfy. Any use of discretion, beyond the normal 
operation of the plan, would be justified in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration and, as appropriate, the subject of consultation with 
the Company's major shareholders.
The use of discretion in relation to the Company's BETsave Plan 
will be as permitted under HMRC rules and the Listing Rules.
Past awards
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving the remuneration policy, 
authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments 
entered into with current or former Directors that have been 
disclosed previously to shareholders, including any joining awards 
made on recruitment. The joining awards granted to the current 
Executive Team are disclosed in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration on page 60. 
Any incentive awards which have been granted to employees who 
may be subsequently promoted to the Board will vest according 
to their original terms.
Choice of performance measures
The performance metrics that are used for both the Annual Bonus 
and LTIP have been selected to reflect the Group's overall business 
strategy and its key performance indicators.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 
Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 55 Annual Bonus
The majority of annual performance measures are focused on the achievement of challenging financial metrics. These may include, but 
are not limited to, revenue and profit generation. Each metric will reflect how well the Group is growing the business. 
Measure Link to strategy
REVENUE   The use of revenue aligns with our strategic objectives of widening the range of products and services that 
we offer, attracting new customers, increasing the activity of existing customers, and building our market 
share in all regions in which we operate.
PROFIT   The use of a profit based measure, such as EBITDA, alongside revenue helps ensure a balance between 
growth and profitability. 
  EBITDA measures the underlying profits generated by the business and whether management is converting 
growth into profits effectively. 
PERSONAL   Individual objectives measure whether management is delivering against stated key business and personal 
targets which are linked to the corporate strategy.
In setting financial parameters, the Committee takes into account the Company's internal budgets and, where applicable, investors' 
expectations. The targets applying to financial measures are based on a sliding scale.
LTIP
For the Company's long-term plans, awards vest subject to delivering against measures which are aligned with the long-term levels 
of return targeted by the Company which may include relative TSR, EPS and Group Revenue. 
Measure Link to strategy
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER 
RETURN
  TSR provides a clear alignment between the value created for shareholders and the reward earned  
by Executives.
EARNINGS PER SHARE   EPS captures the long-term growth in earnings, which is most closely aligned to the overall financial 
performance expected by shareholders.
GROUP REVENUE   Revenue targets ensure top line growth is being generated from new markets and through the widening  
of our product offering. 
Additional measures which are linked to the business strategy at the time may also be used. Targets are set based on a sliding scale that 
takes account of internal planning and external market expectations for the Company. 
How Executive pay compares to other employees
The Committee receives an overview of the reward structure and quantum applying to the whole employee population on a periodic 
basis from the HR Director. The information presented is taken into consideration when setting the pay levels of Executive Directors 
and other senior executives.
At other levels of the Group, employees will receive a remuneration package that is reflective of their role and responsibilities, set by 
reference to internal relativities and external market data where applicable. Employees at the Executive level will typically have a greater 
emphasis on performance-related and long-term pay compared to those below this level. Annual incentives may be payable based on 
performance measures which are suitable to the nature and responsibility of the role.

The Company's remuneration policy results in a significant 
proportion of the remuneration received by Executive Directors 
being dependent on Company performance. The chart above 
illustrates how the total pay opportunities for the current Executive 
Directors vary under three performance scenarios - Minimum, 
Target and Maximum - in the first year to which the policy 
applies, i.e. FY15. 
Assumptions underlying the scenarios:
  Minimum - comprises fixed pay only which includes base salary 
as at 1 July 2014, pension allowances in line with the Company's 
policy and the value of benefits (using historic values for FY14 
as a proxy).
  Target - comprises fixed pay plus two-thirds of the maximum 
payout under the Annual Bonus plan (120% of salary), and 25% 
of the LTIP vesting (75% and 50% of salary for the CEO and 
CFO respectively).
  Maximum - comprises fixed pay plus 100% of the maximum 
payout under the Annual Bonus plan (180% of salary) and 
100% of the LTIP vesting (300% and 200% of salary for the 
CEO and CFO respectively).
  No share price appreciation has been used and all-employee 
share plan awards have been excluded.
In respect of Target performance, the chart reflects the position 
for the first financial year for which this policy applies for the 
current Executive Directors. The Committee retains the flexibility 
to adjust the calibration of performance with incentive plan 
payouts at Threshold, Target and Maximum levels subject to any 
constraints set out in the Policy Table. 
Service agreements and loss of office
The Executive Directors have service contracts that can be 
terminated by either party on the giving of 12 months' notice. 
There is no entitlement to the payment of a predetermined 
amount on termination of employment in any circumstances.
The Executive Directors' service agreements contain provisions for 
payment in lieu of notice of 12 months' salary at the Company's 
discretion. The Company may choose to make any payment in 
monthly instalments. If an Executive finds alternative relevant 
employment subject to a minimum level of salary being earned, 
the amount of any monthly payments in lieu of notice will be 
reduced accordingly.
There are no enhanced provisions on a change of control. If the 
Executive's employment is terminated for reasons of misconduct 
or breach of contract no payments will be made, other than any 
amounts due at the date of termination. Any statutory entitlements 
or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection with the 
termination would be paid as necessary.
The service contract of any new appointment would be based  
on similar terms. 
No annual incentive is payable if a Director ceases employment 
or is under notice of termination of employment prior to the date 
that the bonus is due to be paid. However, in certain good leaver 
situations such as death, ill-health, redundancy, retirement with 
the agreement of the employer or for any other reason at the 
Committee's discretion, a pro-rata bonus may be payable (unless 
the Committee determines that no deduction should apply), and 
subject to the achievement of the performance conditions. 
The conditions covering loss of office payments are as set out 
in the individual plan rules of the DSIP and the LTIP. 
In summary, under the DSIP rules, unvested deferred bonus 
awards vest in full for death, redundancy, ill-health and retirement 
(with the agreement of the employer). For any other 
circumstances, any outstanding awards will lapse on the date  
of cessation. 
Under the LTIP rules, if an Executive ceases employment due to 
death, retirement at contractual retirement age (or earlier with the 
consent of the Remuneration Committee), redundancy, ill-health  
or permanent disability, or any other reason at the Committee's 
discretion, the awards may vest at the normal vesting date or 
upon cessation subject to the performance conditions being 
achieved at either date, on a pro-rata basis to reflect the unexpired 
proportion of the performance or vesting period. The Committee 
may decide not to pro-rate if it decides it is appropriate to do so.
The restricted shares granted to Breon Corcoran on his 
appointment will normally lapse on cessation of employment. 
However, if the Executive ceases employment for reasons of 
death, retirement, injury or disability or any other reason at the 
Committee's discretion, the awards shall vest on the date of 
cessation and a pro-rata reduction shall be applied to reflect the 
early vesting. The Committee may, if it feels it is inappropriate  
to apply a pro-rata reduction, decide not to do so.

Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors 
All Non-Executive Directors' services are provided for under the 
terms of a letter of appointment with the Group, and are subject 
to annual re-election with one month's notice by either party 
(except for the Chairman with three months' notice by either 
party). The appointment letters for the Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors provide that no compensation is payable on 
termination, other than accrued fees and expenses. Details of the 
terms of the appointment of the current Non-Executive Directors

* Please see Non-Executive Directors' profiles for total service on page 37.
Recruitment remuneration
The base salary for a new appointment will be set taking into 
account the skills and experience of the individual, internal 
relativities and the market rate for the role as identified by any 
relevant benchmarking of companies of a comparable size and 
complexity. If it is considered appropriate to set the salary for  
a new Executive Director at a level which is below market (for 
example, to allow them to gain experience in the role) their salary 
may be increased to achieve the desired market positioning by way 
of a series of phased above inflation increases. Any increases will 
be subject to the individual's continued development in the role. 
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be 
set in accordance with the limits contained in the Company's 
approved remuneration policy at the time of appointment. The 
annual incentive plan will be operated, as set out above for current 
Executives, albeit with any payment pro-rata for the period of 
employment and with the flexibility to use different performance 
measures and targets, depending on the timing and nature of 
the appointment. 
Additionally in the case of any Executive Director being recruited 
overseas, or being recruited by the Company to relocate overseas 
to perform his duties, the Committee may offer expatriate benefits 
on an ongoing basis. 
The Committee may also approve the payment of one-off 
relocation-related expenses and legal fees incurred by the individual. 
In addition, the Committee may offer cash and/or share-based 
elements to compensate an individual for remuneration which 
would be forfeited on leaving a former employer, when it considers 
these to be in the best interests of the Company (and therefore 
shareholders). Such payments would take account of remuneration 
relinquished and would mirror (as far as possible) the delivery 
mechanism, time horizons and performance requirement attached 
to that remuneration. Where possible this will be facilitated 
through the Company's existing share plans, but if not the 
Committee may use the provisions of 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules. 
In the case of an internal appointment, any variable pay element 
awarded in respect of the prior role will be allowed to pay out 
according to its original terms stipulated on grant or adjusted 
as considered desirable to reflect the new role.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive 
Director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance 
with the approved remuneration policy in force at that time.
External directorships
After the first anniversary of appointment, an Executive Director 
may take up an external Non-Executive Director position with the 
agreement of the Board. Fees paid for external appointments may 
be retained by the individual concerned. 
Consideration of employee views
Whilst the Committee has not formally consulted directly with 
employees on matters of Executive pay, it does receive periodic 
updates from the HR Director on the overall remuneration 
structures and policies for all employees, and uses these as broad 
context when setting the policy for Executive Directors. 
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee maintains an open and transparent dialogue 
with shareholders and takes an active interest in voting outcomes. 
Feedback received from shareholders, at the AGM and any other 
meetings during the year, is considered by the Committee on a 
timely basis. Any material changes to the remuneration policy will 
be the subject of prior consultation with our major shareholders 
and institutional investor bodies as required.

DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT: REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT CONTINUED
58 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 This part of the report has been prepared in accordance with the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 and the Listing Rules.  
The Annual Remuneration Report (together with the Chairman's 
Annual Statement) will be put to an advisory shareholder vote  
at the 2014 AGM. The information on pages 59 to 67 has been 
audited where stated.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee currently comprises four 
independent Non-Executive Directors, in compliance with the 
Code. The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Leo Quinn, and 
its other members are Ian Dyson, Peter Jackson and Peter Rigby. 
Mike McTighe chaired the Committee until 31 March 2014 and 
Fru Hazlitt was a member of the Committee until 31 March 2014. 
Biographies of the Committee members can be found on page 37. 
The Committee meets at least twice each year, and during the year 
under review met on six occasions. Each member's attendance 
at these meetings is set out in the Corporate Governance report 
on page 40. 
Advice provided to the Committee
The Committee received material assistance and advice from the 
Chairman, CEO and the Group HR Director, although no individual 
is present for decisions relating to their personal remuneration.
The Committee appointed and has been advised during the year 
by New Bridge Street (NBS). NBS is a separate subsidiary of the 
Group's insurance broker Aon plc (and it does not provide any 
other services to the Company). NBS is a founder signatory to the 
Remuneration Consulting Group's Code of Conduct and its total 
fees in relation to Remuneration Committee advice during the year 
were  66,491. The Committee considers that NBS is independent.

With regard to the CEO, his personal objectives included, but were not limited to, growing business profitability, focusing on customer 
acquisition and developing a high performance culture. The CFO's objectives included, but were not limited to, strengthening internal 
controls and financial processes, and focusing on our investors. 
Performance against the objectives is assessed by the Remuneration Committee at the end of the year (with input from the Chairman 
and CEO as appropriate). In light of performance against the objectives set, the Remuneration Committee awarded bonuses as outlined

The value of the deferred element will be delivered in the form of a DSIP share award that will vest 50% after one year from grant and 
50% after two years subject to continued employment. Clawback provisions will apply. 
The Committee is satisfied that the Annual Bonus awarded is a fair reflection of the Group's and individual's performance during the year 
under review. 
Long Term Incentive Plan awards vesting in the year (audited)
The current Executive Directors have no LTIP awards with performance periods ending in the year to 30 April 2014. The performance 
period for the 2011 LTIP scheme ended on 30 April 2014. There are 21 participants with interests in the 2011 LTIP, of whom one, 
Stephen Morana, was a former Executive Director (until 3 December 2012) but remained an employee until 31 March 2013. As disclosed 
in last year's report, Stephen Morana was treated as a good leaver and his interests in the 2011 LTIP are disclosed below.
The 2011 awards were subject to performance measures, with 50% based on EPS and 50% on Revenue targets for FY14. In line with 
the plan documentation, the Committee, at its discretion, has the ability to adjust the targets that were originally set to reflect any 
material changes in, for example, regulatory outcomes relative to the scenario envisaged when setting the targets and reporting 
definitions or accounting policies. 
In respect of the targets applying to the 2011 awards, the Committee has used its discretion to adjust the EPS and Revenue targets that 
were originally set to reflect:
  the decision to exit from Greece due to unacceptable levels of legal risk and to withdraw the Exchange from Germany due to the 
introduction of a turnover tax;
  the withdrawal of Betfair's Exchange from Spain following new regulations introduced in June 2012;
  changes to the regulatory timetable regarding the introduction of exchanges in Italy; and
  in respect of EPS only, a change to accounting definitions which now deducts IFRS 2 (Share-Based Payment) charges from profit.
The Committee is satisfied that the adjustments are a result of external factors that were unforeseen, outside the control of management 
and result in targets that are no less or more challenging than the targets that were originally set. The revised targets and performance 
against them are set out below:
FY14 Revenue FY14 EPS
% of relevant part of the award that vests

 567.5m  512.4m 67.9p 50.6p Maximum - 100%

In addition to the three performance targets detailed above, an 
underpin will also apply which means that for any awards to vest, 
the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that there has 
been an improvement in the Company's underlying financial 
performance which reflects the proposed level of vesting under 
each performance target. These performance targets will be 
reviewed by the Committee at the end of the three year 
performance period.

  These awards were granted on joining Betfair under provision 9.4.2(R) in the Listing Rules and were issued in the form of conditional awards with no performance 
conditions attached. The awards vest in three equal tranches on each anniversary following the date of grant, 1 August 2012. The first tranche vested on 1 August 2013 
when the share price was  9.209.

  On joining, Breon Corcoran was granted performance-linked nominal cost options under provision 9.4.2(R) of the Listing Rules. The performance conditions mirror the 
terms of the 2012 LTIP grant made to other selected Betfair employees earlier that year. 50% of the award is subject to a relative TSR target over a three year period 
against other listed betting companies. For TSR equal to median of the comparator group, 25% of this element of the award will vest, rising on a straight-line basis to full 
vesting for upper quartile TSR. 
  25% of the award is subject to an EPS target over the three year financial period ending 30 April 2015. For EPS of 50.3 pence (7% compound p.a.) 25% of this element

 The value of benefits fell from  3,990 in FY13 (pro-rated up for a full year) to  2,888 in FY14. The fall reflects a fall in the cost of renewing the insurance benefits.

 The UK and Ireland employee population covers the majority of the workforce and, in the view of the Committee, is the most appropriate comparator group. 
The calculation covers employees who were continuously employed for FY14 (1 May 2013 to 30 April 2014).

 Bonuses for the workforce for FY14 have not been concluded at the time of signing this report and therefore this is an indicative figure.

Annual Bonus - Annual Cash Incentive Plan and Deferred Share Incentive Plan
The Annual Bonus will operate in a broadly similar manner to the year ended 30 April 2014. The maximum bonus will remain as 180% 
of salary, with two-thirds of any bonus payable in cash (ACIP) and the remaining one-third deferred into Group shares (DSIP). Any 
deferred shares will vest 50% after one year and 50% after two years from the date of grant, subject to continued employment. 
Dividends may be paid on any vested DSIP shares. 
Clawback provisions will apply on DSIP awards for reasons of misstatement, miscalculation or misconduct within two years of the date 
of grant. 
The Committee reviews the performance measures and targets on an annual basis to ensure they remain appropriately aligned to the 
overall business strategy but do not encourage excessive risk taking.
The performance measures for the FY15 Annual Bonus are as follows: 
Element Weighting % of salary
Revenue 44.5% 80%
EBITDA 44.5% 80%
Personal 11% 20%
Total 100% 180%
The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the performance targets for the forthcoming year, as these include items which 
the Committee considers commercially sensitive. The Committee intends to provide retrospective disclosure of certain performance 
measures in next year's Annual Report on Remuneration, to the extent that the Committee determines that the measures are no longer 
commercially sensitive.

DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT: ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED
66 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan
The Committee intends to make an annual award of nil-cost options under the LTIP at 300% of salary for the CEO and 200% of salary 
for the CFO during FY14. Vested awards will be eligible to receive dividend equivalents and awards will be subject to clawback provisions 
for reasons of misstatement, miscalculation or misconduct within two years of vesting. 
The Committee has reviewed the performance measures and targets for the prospective award and determined that no changes 
are required to the balance of metrics used for the 2013 award. Therefore, the performance conditions for the 2014 award will be 
as follows:
EPS condition (50% of award)
EPS for FY17
1
Shares vesting  
(as % of number relating to 
EPS performance condition)
Less than 50.2p Nil 
50.2p 25%

(on a straight-line basis) 
54.9p or higher 100%

 New gaming taxes are expected to be introduced in the UK, Ireland and Italy 
during the Plan period. If these taxes were applicable in FY14, Betfair would 
have incurred additional costs of c. 36m, significantly reducing EPS for FY14. 
The EPS target for FY17 reflects a full year of these changes in taxation.
TSR condition (25% of award)
Relative TSR performance comparing Betfair's ranking against the 
FTSE 250 constituents excluding Investment Trusts:

(as % of number relating to relative 
TSR performance condition)

Group Revenue target (25% of award)

Revenue performance condition)
Less than  451m Nil 
 451m 25% 
Between  451m and  494m Between 25% and 100%  
(on a straight-line basis) 
 494m or higher 100% 
In addition to the three performance targets detailed above,  
an underpin will also apply which will enable the Remuneration 
Committee to change the vesting result based on the above 
performance targets if it does not consider the Company's 
underlying financial performance to reflect the proposed level  
of vesting. These performance targets will be reviewed by the 
Committee at the end of the three year performance period.
SAYE
Executives will be eligible to participate on the same terms as all 
other UK employees if an invitation to enter a savings contract is 
offered during the year.
