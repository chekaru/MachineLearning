Introduction
This report has been prepared to accord as far as possible with the
Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which introduced
new statutory requirements for UK public companies in relation to
the disclosure of directors' remuneration in respect of periods
ending on or after 31 December 2002. This report also attempts to
meet, as far as is practicable for a company of betinternet's size, the
relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the UK Financial
Services Authority and describes how the board has applied the
Principles of Good Governance relating to directors' remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report
will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the company at
which the financial statements will be approved.
Remuneration Committee
The company has an established Remuneration Committee which
has a formal constitution and is composed of the non-executive
directors of the company under the Chairmanship of D H N Eke.
No director plays a part in any discussion about his own
remuneration.
Remuneration Policy
The Remuneration Committee's policy is to ensure that the
remuneration packages offered are competitive and designed to
attract, retain and motivate executive directors of the right calibre.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is considered by
the executive directors and reflects the time which they commit to
the company. Non-executive directors are no longer able to
participate in any of the company's share option schemes and are
not eligible to join the company's pension scheme.
Mr H Corkill, a non-executive director, was granted an option over
100,000 ordinary shares in September 2000. This is commented
upon under share options below.
The major elements of the remuneration package for the executive
directors are:
Basic annual salary and benefits.
Eligibility to participate in an annual bonus scheme, when such
scheme operates.
Share option incentives.
Contribution to a pension plan.
The committee seeks to ensure that bonus and share option
incentives have a strong link with individual performance.
Basic Salary
The level of basic annual salary and benefits is determined by the
Committee taking into account the performance of the individual
and information from independent sources on the rates of salary for
similar jobs in comparable companies. 
Annual Bonus Payments
Although no bonus scheme operated during the period under
review, it is anticipated that a scheme will operate during the current
year. Bonuses for the executive directors will be calculated with
reference to the profit before tax as disclosed in the audited
financial statements of the group, together with an assessment by
the Committee of the director's performance against agreed personal
targets. Bonus payments will not be pensionable.
Given the nature of the discretionary annual bonus payments, which
will be linked to the respective performance of the group, and the
contribution of individual directors, the Committee believes this
illustrates the relative importance placed on performance related
remuneration.
Share Options
The Committee believes that share ownership by executives
strengthens the link between their personal interests and those of
shareholders. The company currently operates three share option
schemes, although no further options are to be issued under the
Report of the remuneration
committee 21
1998 Share Option Plan. Options are granted to executives
periodically at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The
grant of share options is not subject to fixed performance criteria.
This is deemed to be appropriate as it allows the Committee to
consider the performance of the group and the contribution of the
individual executives and, as with annual bonus payments, illustrates
the relative importance placed on performance related remuneration.
H Corkill, a non-executive director, holds an option over 100,000
ordinary shares. The Committee is aware that a key
recommendation of the report prepared by Derek Higgs ( Review of
the role and effectiveness of non-executive directors') was that non-
executive directors should not have share options. However, the
Committee believes that in view of the historic nature of this option
and its exercise price, it remains appropriate for Mr Corkill to
continue to hold this option.
Pensions
The group intends to contribute to each executive director's personal
pension plan in the current period.
Service Contracts
During the period under review, the service contracts of S P C
Graham and W D Mummery provided for notice periods of twelve
months by all parties. The service contract of P E Doona required six
months' notice by all parties. It is intended that during the current
period each of the executive directors will enter into service
contracts requiring six months' notice by all parties.
