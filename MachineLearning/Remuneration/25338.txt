Report of the Remuneration Committee
Introduction
This report has been prepared to accord as far as possible
with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002
which introduced new statutory requirements for UK public
companies in relation to the disclosure of directors'
remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after
31 December 2002. This report also attempts to meet, as far
as is practicable for a company of betinternet's size, the
relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the UK Financial
Services Authority and describes how the board has applied
the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors'
remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to
approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General
Meeting of the company at which the financial statements will
be approved.
Remuneration Committee
The company has an established Remuneration Committee
which has a formal constitution and is composed of the non-
executive directors of the company under the Chairmanship of
D H N Eke.
No director plays a part in any discussion about his own
remuneration.
Remuneration Policy
The Remuneration Committee's policy is to ensure that the
remuneration packages offered are competitive and designed
to attract, retain and motivate executive directors of the right
calibre.
The major elements of the remuneration package for the
executive directors are:
 Basic annual salary and benefits.
 Eligibility to participate in an annual bonus scheme, when
such scheme operates.
 Share option incentives.
 Contribution to a pension plan.
The committee seeks to ensure that bonus and share option
incentives have a strong link with individual performance.
Basic Salary
The level of basic annual salary and benefits is determined by
the Committee, taking into account the performance of the
individual and information from independent sources on the
rates of salary for similar jobs in comparable companies.
Annual Bonus Payments
Although no bonus scheme operated during the period under
review, it is anticipated that a scheme will operate when group
profitability and cash flow allow. Bonuses for the executive
directors are calculated with reference to the profit before tax
as disclosed in the audited financial statements of the group,
together with an assessment by the Committee of the
director's performance against agreed personal targets. Bonus
payments are not pensionable.
Share Options
The Committee believes that share ownership by executives
strengthens the link between their personal interests and
those of shareholders. The company currently operates four
share option schemes, although it is intended that following
the adoption of the 2005 Share Option Plan, no further
options will be issued under these schemes. Options are
granted to executives periodically at the discretion of the
Remuneration Committee. The grant of share options is not
subject to fixed performance criteria. This is deemed to be
appropriate as it allows the Committee to consider the
performance of the group and the contribution of the
individual executives and, as with annual bonus payments,
illustrates the relative importance placed on performance
related remuneration.
Pensions
The group does not intend to contribute to the personal
pension plans of directors in the forthcoming period.
Service Contracts
During the period under review, the service contract of
Mr G R Knowles provided for a notice period of six months by
all parties and that of Mr D Waddington for a notice period of
three months by all parties. betinternet.com plc
