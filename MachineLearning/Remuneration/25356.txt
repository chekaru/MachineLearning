The Group's policy is being designed to attract, retain and motivate individuals of a calibre
that will ensure the successful leadership and management of the Group. Remuneration

BETonSPORTS plc
Remuneration Committee report packages are designed to reward the executive directors and members of the senior
management team fairly for their contributions, whilst remaining within the range of benefits
offered by similar companies in the sector. The Remuneration Committee is seeking to create
a salary structure which is transparent, fair, and motivational. Part of this package is a
performance related bonus scheme based on corporate performance, team performance and
at least ten personal KPI's. This package, will we believe, align the interests of shareholders
and the senior management team, with particular importance being given to the performance-
related elements. The Directors' and senior management remuneration packages will be the
subject of regular review in accordance with this policy.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is first considered by the executive directors
based on the time which they commit to the Group, the financial and reputation risks attached
to non-executives, and the responsibilities of their role. The Remuneration Committee
considers, then determines the level of remuneration appropriate.
(b) Terms of reference
The Remuneration Committee consists of all the non-executive directors and is chaired by
The Lord Glentoran. The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee include:
  To determine the executive directors and senior management team salaries, and other
remuneration and benefit packages, including incentive arrangements.
  To agree the targets and scope of any performance-related pay elements of the
remuneration package
  To review the executive directors recommendations on the overall remuneration and
benefits policy of the group, with the power and authority to amend it if appropriate.
  To have regard to the provisions of the Combined Code and associated guidance in its
decision-making.
(c) Service contracts
It is the Group's policy that the notice period for the duration of all directors' contracts shall be
no more than one year. This is in accordance with current corporate governance best practice.
(d) Bonuses
The group operates a bonus incentive scheme referred to in paragraph (a) above, which
applies at differing rates for the executive directors and members of senior management. Part
of any payment under this scheme is linked to the annual performance of the business for
which they are responsible; the remainder of such payment is made on a discretionary basis.
