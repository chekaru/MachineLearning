 22 Bett Annual Report and Accounts 2002
Remuneration Report by the Board
As well as complying with the provisions of the Code as disclosed in the Company's corporate governance
statements, the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors' remuneration as
described below.
For completeness of presentation this report covers the remuneration of the non-executive as well as the executive
directors, and also related matters such as the interests of the directors in the Company's shares. It therefore
covers issues which are the concern of the Board as a whole in addition to those which are dealt with by the
Remuneration Committee.
COMPOSITION The Remuneration Committee is appointed by the Board and is composed of the two non-executive
directors, Graham H Webster (Remuneration Committee chairman) and Alistair H Macdiarmid, and Iain C R Bett
(executive chairman of the Board). The Board considers that the remuneration received by Iain Bett as Board
chairman does not materially influence his judgement as a member of the Remuneration Committee. His salary
and benefits are determined by the two non-executive directors and Mr Bett is not present for these discussions.
No discretionary bonus is paid to Mr Bett, and he does not receive any options under any executive share option
scheme.
The non-executive directors do not hold any share options, nor participate in any bonus or pension schemes; they
have no personal interest in the matters to be decided other than as shareholders and no day-to-day involvement
in running the businesses of the Group. Their fees are determined at an annual meeting of the directors.
Apart from the requirement that Remuneration Committees should consist exclusively of non-executive directors,
the constitution and operation of the Remuneration Committee comply with the Principles of Good Governance
relating to directors' remuneration.
REMUNERATION POLICY The basic objectives of the Remuneration Committee's policies are that executive
directors should receive compensation which is appropriate to their level of responsibility and performance, 
and which will attract, motivate and retain executives of the necessary calibre. The Committee also agrees, 
in consultation with Ronald G Hanna, chief executive, the principles underlying remuneration for other senior
executives.

Basic salary The salary of individual executive directors is reviewed at 1 September each year. Account is taken
of individual achievements, any change in responsibilities that may have occurred and the salaries for similar 
roles in comparable companies.
Benefits Certain executive directors receive taxable benefits comprising car, fuel, telephone and healthcare.
Under long-standing contractual arrangements, taxable benefits for Iain C R Bett and Ian T Townsend are
pensionable.
Bonuses Payments under the discretionary bonus scheme for the executive directors are conditional on the
achievement of operating profit and specific performance targets. Discretionary bonuses are not pensionable 
with the exception of bonuses paid to Ronald G Hanna; this is a long-standing contractual arrangement and
unlikely to be repeated in future appointments. 23 Bett Annual Report and Accounts 2002
Remuneration Report by the Board
Pensions Executive directors joining the Company prior to 1 September 1997 were entitled to become members 
of the Group's contributory defined benefit pension scheme or, if preferred, to receive payment of a proportion 
of salary into a personal money purchase pension scheme. Executive directors joining the Company after 
1 September 1997 are entitled to join the Group's personal pension money purchase scheme and receive payment 
of a proportion of salary into the scheme. The Group's defined benefit pension scheme is designed to provide a
pension of one sixtieth of final pensionable salary for each year of completed pensionable service. The pension
contributions shown in the table above reflect the actual payments made for those directors who are not members
of the Group's defined benefit pension scheme. The following directors had accrued entitlements under the
Group's defined benefit scheme as follows:

* At 14 February 2002
The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually from normal retirement based on service 
to the end of the year under review.
The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance 
Note GN11 less director's contributions.
Members of both schemes have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions; neither the contributions 
nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
Share options The Committee believes that share ownership by executive directors and senior executives
strengthens the link between their personal interest and those of the shareholders. The Group operates an
Executive Share Option Scheme which comprises an Inland Revenue approved part and an Inland Revenue
unapproved part. The most recent grants of options to executive directors were on 17 December 2001. The
Remuneration Committee has initially set a performance condition of options normally only being exercisable 
if the growth of the Company's earnings per share at least matches the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 
9 per cent over a three year period.
DIRECTORS AND THEIR INTERESTS The directors who held office at 31 August 2002 and their beneficial interests
in the ordinary shares of Bett Brothers plc were as follows:

the Company wishes to terminate their employment within the 15 months following the date of the acquisition, 
the period of notice which the Company is obliged to give is two years.
OUTSIDE APPOINTMENTS Subject to Board approval, executive directors may serve as non-executive directors 
on the boards of other companies and may retain remuneration from such appointments.
