BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003
Remuneration report
Introduction
This report is made by the Board on the recommendation of the
Remuneration Committee. The first part of the report provides details
of BG Group's remuneration policy. The second part provides details 
of the remuneration, service contracts and share interests of all the
Directors for the year ended 31 December 2003. The report has been
approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by the Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee. The Directors confirm that, in preparing
this report, they have followed the principles of Schedule B of the
Combined Code.
BG Group continues to look to performance related incentives rather
than base salaries for employees to achieve above average reward. 
Our remuneration policy is designed to ensure that executives of the
highest calibre are recruited and retained and that our strong
performance ethic is reinforced.
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting
of the Company to be held on 21 May 2004 inviting them to approve
this report.
In accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations
2002 (the  Regulations'), the following sections of the report are
subject to audit: Directors' Remuneration; Director's Interest under 
the BG Group New Long Term Incentive Scheme (Phantom Shares);
Directors' Interests in Shares under the BG Group New Long Term
Incentive Scheme; Options; and the table and notes in the Pensions
section of the report. The remaining sections are not subject to audit.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Committee consists exclusively of independent non-executive
Directors and meets on at least four occasions each year. The members
are: Elwyn Eilledge (Committee Chairman), Peter Backhouse, Sir John
Coles, Paul Collins and Dame Stella Rimington. Sir Richard Giordano was
a member of the Committee until his retirement from the Company on
31 December 2003. David Benson, Keith Mackrell and Lord Sharman were
members of the Committee until 12 February 2004. Emma Nichol,
Company Secretary, attends meetings as Secretary to the Committee.
Frank Chapman (Chief Executive), Peter Duffy (Executive Vice President
Human Resources), and Cathy Aldwinckle (Head of Compensation and
Benefits), attend meetings by invitation and provide advice and services
to the Committee to enable it to make informed decisions. No Director
is present when his or her own remuneration is being discussed. 
The Remuneration Committee also meets without management and
receives information and independent executive remuneration advice
from an external consultancy firm, Towers Perrin, appointed by the
Remuneration Committee. In relation to executive remuneration,
Towers Perrin provides market salary data and advice on market
trends, long-term incentive schemes and other remuneration issues. 
In addition, Towers Perrin provides some general compensation 
and benefits advice and information and is responsible for the
administration of some of the share schemes
(a)
.
Other external advisers also provide support and advice in relation 
to executive remuneration. Herbert Smith provides legal advice and
assistance on share schemes (as well as other legal services to the
Group) and Watson Wyatt provides actuarial advice to the Company
and to the trustees of the BG Pension Scheme
(a)
. These advisers are
appointed by management.
Remuneration policy
BG Group needs to be able to employ and retain international
employees of the highest calibre with the necessary skills, capabilities
and experience to execute its business strategy and thereby deliver
strong growth. The catchment area for recruitment is increasingly
outside the UK and the required talent is scarce. 
The overriding objectives of our remuneration policy are:
  to enable the recruitment and retention of this limited resource; and
  to reinforce our strong performance ethic.
Accordingly, the central premise of the policy is that, while reward
arrangements should be market competitive, employees should look
to performance related incentives rather than base salaries to achieve
above average reward. Performance related incentive schemes form a
significant proportion of the total reward package for executives and
are designed to align executives' interests with those of shareholders
and establish a clear link between pay and performance.
To implement our policy, we have a well-developed, company-wide
performance management system and we operate three
complementary performance related incentive schemes for executives.
The three schemes are the Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS), the Long
Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS) and the Company Share Option Scheme
(CSOS). The AIS is designed to focus executives on the business
priorities for the financial year and to reinforce our individual
performance culture. The aim of the LTIS is to motivate participants 
to maximise total shareholder return (TSR)
(b)
as measured against a
comparator group of international oil and gas companies over a period
of three years. The CSOS aims to drive real earnings growth over the
long term. The mechanism used for measuring this is the growth in
the Group's published earnings per share (EPS)
(c)
relative to the growth
in the retail price index, excluding mortgage interest repayments
(RPIX). Further details of the AIS, the LTIS and the CSOS can be found
on pages 60 to 62. 
The varying performance periods and performance conditions of the
three schemes combine and complement each other to enable the
measurement and reward of both short- and long-term performance
and of absolute (AIS), sustained (CSOS) and comparative (LTIS)
financial performance. 
The Committee's principal responsibilities are:
  setting, reviewing and recommending to the Board for approval
the Company's overall remuneration policy and strategy;
  setting, reviewing and approving individual remuneration
packages for Executive Directors and the Chairman including
terms and conditions of employment and any changes to 
the packages;
  reviewing the salary structure and terms, conditions 
and benefits of employment of other Group Executive
Committee members; and
  approving the rules, and launch, of any Company share, share
option or cash based incentive scheme and the grant, award,
allocation or issue of shares, share options or payments under
such scheme. 
The full terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee 
can be found on the BG Group website and copies are available
on request.
(a) Other than in the provision of the services outlined above, none of Towers Perrin,
Herbert Smith or Watson Wyatt provides any services to the Group or has any
connection with the Group.
(b) TSR is defined as the return on investment obtained from holding a company's shares
over a period. It includes dividends paid, the change in the capital value of the shares
and other payments to, or by, shareholders within the period.
(c) EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings for the financial year (excluding exceptional
items) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue and ranking for
dividend during the year. EPS is published quarterly when BG Group reports its results. 60
BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003
Remuneration report continued
The Committee reviews the remuneration policy on a regular basis
and recommends changes as and when appropriate. No changes are
proposed to the policy this year in so far as it applies to Directors'
remuneration. However, the Company plans to review the use of the
CSOS as the primary share based incentive vehicle for the broader
employee population below senior management level. 
In defining BG Group's remuneration policy, the Remuneration
Committee takes into account advice received from external consultants
and also best practice guidelines set by institutional shareholder
bodies, including the revised principles and guidelines on executive
remuneration issued by the Association of British Insurers (ABI).
Components of remuneration
The current remuneration package for Executive Directors comprises
performance related and non-performance related components. The
performance related components are the incentive schemes referred
to above and the non-performance related components are base
salary, taxable benefits and pension entitlements. In addition, the
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Company's 
all-employee share schemes. Pay and employment conditions
elsewhere in the Group have been taken into account by the
Remuneration Committee in determining the remuneration
packages for Executive Directors and the Committee has also
followed the provisions of Schedule A to the Combined Code.
The proportion of each Executive Director's total remuneration that
is performance related is significant even for target (which is based
on budget) performance. For stretch (significantly above budget)
performance, the total amount of remuneration payable is higher, 
as is the proportion of that total which is performance related. 
In determining the relative importance of those elements of
remuneration which are, and those which are not, performance
related as required by the Regulations, we have, as last year, made 
a number of assumptions on the Company's share price growth and
TSR, relative to the Company's comparator group, over the next three
years. Neither these assumptions nor our remuneration policy have
changed from last year. The average proportion of remuneration
(excluding pension) that is performance related for target
performance is 58% and for stretch performance is 79%. This is
illustrated by the chart below. These figures are different from last
year because we have excluded the value of pensions in calculating
the proportion of fixed to variable pay. Pension values can vary quite
significantly from year to year and from person to person and are
shown separately on page 68.
Base salaries
Executive Directors' salaries are reviewed each year with any
changes taking effect from 1 April. This review takes into account
individual performance and market competitiveness. Pensionable
salary is derived from base salary only.
In line with our remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee
benchmarks Executive Directors' salaries against a comparator group.
Given BG Group's international presence and position roughly in the
middle of the FTSE 50, the Remuneration Committee considered 
it appropriate to reference Executive Directors' base salaries for 
the 1 April 2003 salary review against the median of the FTSE 50. 
We will use the same comparator group for the 1 April 2004 review.
Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS)
The Company operates a cash based annual incentive scheme, 
which provides an incentive opportunity in the range of 0% to 
100% of base salary.
At the start of the incentive year (1 January), based on the Company's
business priorities, the Remuneration Committee sets both the
performance measures and the targets. These targets ensure that
incentives at the higher end of the range are payable only for
demonstrably superior Company and individual performance.
For the Executive Directors and other members of the Group
Executive Committee, the financial performance measures for 
the 2003 incentive year were EPS and return on average capital
employed (ROACE)
(a)
(both such measures adjusted to take into
account the volatility of upstream commodity prices). These
measures (adjusted to take into account both the volatility of
US$/UK  exchange rates and upstream commodity prices) will 
also apply for 2004.
When determining incentive payments, the Remuneration 
Committee considers overall Group performance, including financial
performance and health, safety and environmental performance, 
as well as individual performance. Payments in respect of the 2003
incentive year were made in February 2004 based on 2003 results.
Payments under the AIS are non-pensionable.
Long-term incentives - Estimated Present Value (EPV)
For the last two years, we have been using EPV as a measure 
to describe the value, at the time of grant or allocation, of 
long-term incentives which may, or may not, pay out in the future.
This measure was developed by our external consultants, Towers
Perrin, and takes account of the performance conditions and the 
risk that grants and allocations may be forfeited. This EPV is then
used to determine the appropriate levels of face value CSOS grants
and LTIS allocations.
As agreed by shareholders at our Annual General Meeting in 2002,
the Remuneration Committee is able to make awards under both
schemes, up to a maximum combined EPV of 175% of base salary
each year. The actual maximum combined EPV granted during 2003
was slightly less than 140%.
Each year, the Remuneration Committee decides on the appropriate
blend of CSOS grants and LTIS allocations that will be made to
Executive Directors within the maximum combined EPV. Awards will
always be made under both schemes, with not less than one-third
and not more than two-thirds of the total combined EPV being
delivered by either scheme. When making this decision, the
Remuneration Committee takes a number of factors into consideration

(excluding exceptional items) plus net interest payable on net borrowings as a
percentage of average capital employed. 61
BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003
including cost, the need to remain within scheme dilution limits 
and the performance conditions considered to be key to BG Group's
strategy at the time of the allocation or grant. For the 2003 awards,
the Executive Directors received two-thirds of the total combined
EPV through the LTIS and one-third through the CSOS. 
Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS)
A limited number of employees are allocated Company shares 
under the LTIS. This allocation marks the beginning of a three year
performance period. The Company's TSR performance against that 
of a comparator group over the three year period will determine
what proportion of the allocated shares will be transferred into 
the ownership of the employee. The Remuneration Committee 
considers that measuring performance against a comparator 
group of companies ensures that executives are rewarded based 
on BG Group's performance relative to the performance of the 
other companies in the comparator group. The TSR performance 
is measured by the independent TSR monitoring service of 
Alithos Limited.
The LTIS comparator group for the 2002 and 2003 allocations
comprises 21 international oil and gas companies (including BG
Group plc) of which 12 are headquartered in the USA, three in the UK
and six elsewhere in Europe
(a)
. This group has been chosen because
the Remuneration Committee believes that it comprises our major
business competitors - in other words, those companies against
which BG Group is compared by shareholders. 
The other companies in the comparator group are as follows: 
The Remuneration Committee has set the following performance
conditions: 
Where performance is between Median (M) and Upper Quartile (UQ),
or (for the 2002 and 2003 allocations only) between UQ and Top (T),
the percentage of shares to be transferred is determined on a
proportionate basis. 
These performance conditions are illustrated by the graph below:
There is no retest provision. In the event of a change of control,
vesting of shares under the LTIS is not automatic and would depend
upon the extent to which the performance conditions had been met
at the time.
Shares allocated under the 1999 LTIS scheme were transferred 
to eligible employees on 1 October 2003 when the one year retention 
period ended. The performance period for the 2000 allocation ended
on 30 September 2003. BG Group's final position in the comparator
group meant that 52% of the original allocation of shares was put
into trust on behalf of participating employees. Subject to the rules
of the LTIS, these shares will be transferred to those employees at
the end of the retention period in October 2004.
The one year retention period also applies for the 2001 allocation but
there is no retention period for the 2002 and 2003 LTIS allocations.
Company Share Option Scheme (CSOS)
Approximately 1 300 employees are currently eligible to participate
in the CSOS including UK payroll employees and overseas employees
above a certain level of seniority.
The Company grants an option over its shares to each eligible
employee and the option price is set at the fair market value at the
time of the grant. As described below, the CSOS measures
performance according to EPS growth relative to the growth in RPIX.
The Remuneration Committee considers that the inclusion of an EPS
performance measure ensures that executives receive rewards only
when the Company has achieved sustained earnings growth during
the performance period. To the extent that the performance target
has been met three years from the date of grant, the option may be
exercised (in whole or in part) at any time up to the expiry of ten
years from the date of grant. 
As in 2002, the levels of grant made to individual employees during
2003 were differentiated based on each individual's performance to
date and expectation of future contributions. For the 2003 grant, the
Remuneration Committee set the following performance targets:

Remuneration report continued
A proportion of between half and all of the option will be exercisable
if the Company achieves EPS growth over three years of RPIX plus
between 15% and 30%.
These are the same as the targets which apply to the 2001 and 2002
grants and are considered by the Remuneration Committee to be
particularly demanding. These performance targets are illustrated by
the graph below.
Fixed point retesting is allowed in years four and five but, in this
event, EPS growth of RPIX plus 40% or plus 50% respectively must 
be achieved for all of the option to become exercisable. At the end 
of year five, the option will be exercisable only to the extent that 
the performance conditions have been met. The Remuneration
Committee is sensitive to the current corporate governance climate
on the matter of retesting. However, it considers, particularly in light
of the macroeconomic factors which affect the business, that a
combination of genuinely stretching performance conditions and 
the ability to retest those conditions ensures that management is
motivated to achieve, and appropriately rewarded for, long-term
Company performance. The Committee will review the position
again at the time of making further grants in 2004.
In the event of a change of control, exercise of the option under the
CSOS is not automatic and would depend upon the extent to which
the performance conditions had been met at the time.
Over the three year performance period for the 2000 CS0S grant, the
Company's EPS growth above the growth in the RPIX exceeded 30%.
As a result, 100% of the shares under option granted to employees in
November 2000 are exercisable prior to November 2010. 
All-Employee Share Schemes
In order to encourage share ownership, the Company currently
provides two all-employee share schemes for its UK employees, 
the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) and the Sharesave Scheme. 
Share Incentive Plan (SIP) 
The BG Group SIP is approved by the Inland Revenue. There are 
two parts to the SIP - the Partnership Shares Plan and the Free
Shares Plan.
(a) Partnership Shares 
Eligible employees are offered the opportunity to buy Company
shares from pre-tax earnings as part of a regular share purchase
plan. Shares are currently purchased every six months using
employees' accumulated deductions and are placed in trust. 
The fifth Partnership Share purchase was made on 20 October 2003.
At 31 December 2003, 60% of eligible employees were participating
in this plan, contributing an average monthly payment of  105. 
Of those participating, 74% were contributing the maximum 
of  125 per month.
(b) Free Shares
A Free Shares award of 1 196 shares was made on 7 April 2003 to all
eligible employees in the UK based on the Group's performance
during 2002. These shares will be held in trust for up to five years.
For 2003, the Remuneration Committee may make awards of Free
Shares in the Company up to a value of  3 000 (the statutory limit)
for each individual. All eligible employees will receive the same
number of shares. This number will be determined based on the
extent to which the Company has met the agreed profit targets 
for 2003. 
Sharesave Scheme
The Company continued to operate the BG Group Sharesave Scheme
in 2003. The scheme is approved by the Inland Revenue and provides
for eligible employees to acquire the Company's shares with the
proceeds of a monthly savings contract. The contract period is three
or five years. At 31 December 2003, 83% of eligible employees were
participating in the Sharesave Scheme, contributing an average
monthly payment of  211. Of those participating, 70% were
contributing the maximum of  250 per month. 
Employee Profit Sharing Scheme
This scheme ceased to operate at the end of 2000. During 2003,
shares allocated to participants in respect of the 1999 scheme were
released and transferred into their names. 
Shares held in respect of the 2000 scheme will be released to eligible
participants in 2004. 
Dilution
The ABI has recently published guidelines relating to the disclosure
of the percentage of a company's issued share capital that can be
issued to employees under share schemes. In the event of all shares
outstanding as at 31 December 2003, under option schemes
involving the issue of new shares becoming exercisable, the resulting
issue of shares would represent less than 1.33% of the issued share
capital as at that date.
Shareholding guidelines
Shareholding guidelines exist for Executive Directors, Group
Executive Committee members and certain other senior employees
to encourage substantial long-term share ownership. These require
that, over a period of five years from the introduction of the
guidelines in 2002 (or the Director's appointment, if later), Executive
Directors build up, and then retain, a holding of shares with a value
equivalent to twice base salary. The required holding for other
members of the Group Executive Committee is one-times base 
salary and for certain other senior employees is half base salary. 
The guidelines require that, in relation to the 2002 and later LTIS
allocations, vested shares (net of tax) should be retained by the
individual until the required shareholding level is reached.

Service contracts
The Executive Directors' service contracts, including arrangements
for early termination, are carefully considered by the Remuneration
Committee and are designed to recruit, retain and motivate
Directors of the quality required to manage the Company. The
Remuneration Committee considers that a notice period of one 
year is appropriate. 
The Executive Directors' service contracts contain change of control
provisions. Should the Directors' employment be terminated within 
12 months of a change of control, they are entitled to liquidated
damages. The amount of liquidated damages is equal to one year's
gross salary and a credit of one year's pensionable service (less any
deductions the employer is required to make), which the
Remuneration Committee considers to be a genuine pre-estimate of
loss. The Remuneration Committee considers that these provisions
assist with recruitment and retention and that their inclusion is
therefore in the best interests of shareholders. 
Other than change of control, the Executive Directors' service
contracts do not contain provisions for compensation in the event 
of early termination. When calculating termination payments the
Remuneration Committee takes into account a variety of factors,
including individual and Company performance, the obligation 
for the Director to mitigate his or her own loss (for example, by
gaining new employment) and the Director's age and length of 
service. Further details of the Executive Directors' service 
contracts can be found on pages 64 and 65.
Non-Executive Directors
The Board aims to recruit non-executive Directors of a high calibre
with broad commercial, international or other relevant experience.
Non-executive Directors are appointed by the Board on the
recommendation of the Nominations Committee. Their 
appointment is for an initial term of three years, subject to election
by shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting (AGM) following
their appointment. They are generally reappointed for a second term 
of three years, subject to re-election by shareholders. There is no
notice period and no provision for termination payments. The terms
of engagement of the non-executive Directors are set out in a 
letter of appointment. 
Non-executive Directors (other than the Chairman) are paid a basic
fee of  50 000 per annum. Additional fees are also payable, for
example, for chairing a committee of the Board or acting as Deputy
Chairman. The fees were last reviewed in July 2003, taking into
account increased workload and market movements. The next fee
review will be in 2004 and fees will be reviewed annually thereafter.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the
Company's share schemes, incentive schemes or pension schemes.
Chairman
Sir Richard Giordano had an employment contract with the 
Company. Sir Richard gave notice of resignation on 30 June 2003 and
his employment was terminated by agreement with the Company
when he retired as Chairman on 31 December 2003. His employment
contract contained a notice period of one year or, at the Company's
discretion, payment in lieu of notice. In addition, upon termination of
his employment, Sir Richard became entitled under his contract of
employment to a payment equivalent to the cost of providing an
office (with full-time secretary and use of a car and driver) at a
location of his choice for a period of five years
(a)
. 
Sir Robert Wilson was appointed as Chairman with effect from 
1 January 2004. In line with the other non-executive Directors, 
Sir Robert's appointment is for an initial three year period and there
is no notice period and no provision for payment in the event of early
termination. Sir Robert Wilson is paid a fee of  500 000 per annum,
which is next subject to review in July 2005.

early termination. 65
BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003
Change of Control
As described on page 63, the Executive Directors' employment contracts contain change of control provisions.
For the purposes of these provisions, a change of control is deemed to occur if the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company; 
or if 50% or more of the voting rights of the Company or the right to appoint or remove the majority of the Board of the Company become
vested in any individual or body or group of individuals or bodies acting in concert; or if all or substantially all of the business, assets and
undertakings of the Company become owned by any person, firm or company (other than a subsidiary or associated company). A change of
control is also deemed to occur if the whole of the issued capital of BG Energy Holdings Limited or a substantial part of the undertaking of
that company (including its subsidiaries) is transferred to another company unless that transferee company is a subsidiary of the Company, 
or a company ultimately owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the ultimate owners of the Company. However, a change of
control does not occur if (and only if) through a process of reconstruction the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company owned 
by substantially the same shareholders as are the shareholders of the Company.
The Executive Directors' employment contracts provide that any payments made pursuant to these provisions will be made less any
deductions the employer is required to make and shall be in full and final settlement of any claims the Executive Director may have against
the employer or any associated company arising out of the termination of employment except for any personal injury claim, any claim in
respect of accrued pension rights or statutory employment protection claims.

(a) This entitlement was established prior to demerger and William Friedrich's appointment as an Executive Director of the Company. The notional allocation was reconstituted
after demerger using the average share prices of the first ten days of trading of the shares of the Company and Lattice Group plc immediately following demerger, as
proportions of the aggregate of the two to produce the appropriate factors for adjustment. As a result, the initial allocation price was decreased from  3.7646 to  2.4573 and 
the initial allocation was increased by a factor of 1.532008. As a result of the performance criteria measured in October 2002 (which were identical to those applied to 1999
allocations under the LTIS) a gross amount equivalent to the market value of 47 431 shares was paid to William Friedrich on 1 October 2003 when the retention period ended.
(b) These notional shares were added on the vesting date to reflect the reinvestment of dividends paid on shares held in trust under the LTIS during the retention period.
(c) The market price on 1 October 2003 was  2.605. 66

(a) The October 1999 notional allocation was reconstituted after the demerger of the Lattice Group using the average share prices of the first ten days of trading of the shares of the
Company and Lattice Group plc immediately following demerger, as proportions of the aggregate of the two to produce the appropriate factors for adjustment. As a result, the
initial allocation price was decreased from  3.7646 to  2.4573 and the initial allocation was increased by a factor of 1.532008 in the BG Group New Long Term Incentive Scheme.
As a result of the performance criteria measured in October 2002, 46% of this notional allocation of shares was transferred to the Executive Directors on 1 October 2003 when
the retention period ended. The remainder of the allocation was forfeited.
(b) As a result of the performance criteria measured in November 2003, 52% of the November 2000 notional allocation is now subject to the one year retention period (the
remainder of the allocation having lapsed during the year). These shares will be transferred to the Executive Directors on 3 November 2004, when the retention period ends.
(c) Dividends paid on shares held in trust may, at the discretion of the trustees, be reinvested in BG Group plc shares by the trustees and held on behalf of the Executive Directors
until the normal release date of the respective allocations. The market price at the dates of reinvestment during 2003 were as follows: 2 May 2003 -  2.5025 and 12 September
2003 -  2.6725. On 23 December 2002, the trustees reinvested dividends as follows: Ashley Almanza - 33 shares, Frank Chapman - 449 shares and William Friedrich - 309 shares.
These shares were transferred at the release date and are included in the number of shares vested during the year.
(d) The transfer of shares is dependent on the achievement of performance criteria at the end of a three year performance period. In the case of awards made in 1999, 2000 and
2001, there is a retention period of one year following the end of that performance period. No retention period applies to awards made in 2002 and 2003. The performance
conditions for the scheme are set out on page 61.
(e) The market price on 1 October 2003 was  2.605.
The Directors also have a deemed beneficial interest in 2 561 801 shares as potential beneficiaries in the BG Group New Employees Share Trust.
DIRECTORS' INTERESTS IN ORDINARY SHARES
None of the Executive Directors hold options under the Executive Share Option Scheme and no grants have been made under that scheme
since 1994.

OTHER INTERESTS
On 18 February 2004, Sir Robert Wilson purchased 28 000 ordinary shares in the Company. Other than this, there have been no changes in the
interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings between 1 January 2004 and 5 March 2004.
As of 5 March 2004, the Directors' interests in the share capital of the Company represent less than 1% of the issued share capital of the
Company.
PENSIONS
Frank Chapman, William Friedrich and Ashley Almanza were members of the BG Pension Scheme throughout the year. The benefits provided
for them under the BG Pension Scheme are subject to the earnings cap, which is a restriction on the amount of pay that can be used to
calculate pensions payable from a UK tax approved pension scheme. Consequently, retirement benefits (including contingent death benefits)
that are not covered by the BG Pension Scheme are provided by the Company under an unapproved arrangement, the BG Supplementary
Benefits Scheme. Provision has been made in respect of the additional obligations for these post-retirement benefits.
The arrangements for all the Executive Directors have not changed during the year. They provide an accrual of benefits designed to target a
pension equivalent to two-thirds of their final 12 months' salary on retirement from BG Group at age 60, inclusive of retained benefits. 
As for all members of the BG Pension Scheme, if the Company consents to retirement, no actuarial reduction is applied to pensions payable
from age 55, provided 10 years' service has been completed with the Group (which includes pensionable service transferred from previous
employment). Pensions in payment are increased in line with retail price inflation. An adult dependant's pension is payable on death in
service, equal to two-thirds of that payable to the pension scheme member based on potential service to retirement age. On death in
retirement, an adult dependant's pension is payable equal to two-thirds of the member's pension prior to exchanging any of it for a cash 
lump sum. 
Directors' pension provisions were as follows:

(a) The transfer values shown at the end of 2002 and 2003 represent the value of each Executive Director's accrued pension based on total service completed to the relevant date.
The accrued pensions are the amounts that would have been paid if the Executive Director had left service at the relevant date. The transfer values have been calculated in
accordance with guidance note  GN 11' issued by the Institute of Actuaries and Faculty of Actuaries.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
To broaden the experience of Executive Directors, it is Company policy to allow each of them to accept one external appointment as 
a non-executive director of another company, the fees for which would be retained by the individual Director.
