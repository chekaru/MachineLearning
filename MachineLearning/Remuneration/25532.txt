Remuneration report
This report is made by the Board on the recommendation of the
Remuneration Committee. The first part of the report provides
details of BG Group's remuneration policy. The second part
provides details of the remuneration, service contracts and share
interests of the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2004.
The report has been approved by the Board and signed on its behalf
by Elwyn Eilledge, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the Annual General
Meeting of the Company to be held on 4 May 2005 inviting them
to approve this report.
Our remuneration policy is designed to ensure that executives of
the highest calibre are recruited and retained and that our strong
performance ethic is reinforced. BG Group continues to look to
performance related incentives rather than base salaries for
employees to achieve above average reward.
In accordance with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985, as
inserted by the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002
(the  Regulations'), the following sections of the report have been
audited: Directors' Remuneration; Directors' Interests in Shares
under the BG Group Long Term Incentive Scheme; Options; and 
the table and notes in the Pensions section of the report. The
remaining sections are not subject to audit. 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Committee's principal responsibilities are: 
  setting, reviewing and recommending to the Board 
for approval the Company's overall remuneration policy 
and strategy;
  setting, reviewing and approving individual remuneration
packages for Executive Directors and the Chairman
including terms and conditions of employment and any
changes to the packages;
  reviewing the salary structure and terms, conditions and
benefits of employment of other Group Executive
Committee members and the Company Secretary; and
  approving the rules, and launch, of any Company share,
share option or cash based incentive scheme and the
grant, award, allocation or issue of shares, share options or
payments under such scheme. 
The full terms of reference of the Committee can be 
found on the BG Group website and copies are available 
on request.
The Committee consists exclusively of independent non-executive
Directors and meets on at least four occasions each year. The
members are: 
To 12 February 2004
Elwyn Eilledge (Chairman) David Benson
Peter Backhouse Keith Mackrell
Sir John Coles Lord Sharman
Paul Collins
Dame Stella Rimington
Baroness Hogg (from 27 January 2005)
Ben Mathews, Company Secretary, attends meetings as Secretary
to the Committee. His predecessor, Emma Nichol, attended
meetings until November 2004.
Frank Chapman, Chief Executive, Peter Duffy, Executive Vice
President Human Resources, and Natarajan Sundar, Head of
Performance and Reward, (and his predecessor Cathy Aldwinckle
until September 2004) attend meetings by invitation and provide
advice and services to the Committee to enable it to make
informed decisions. No Director is present when his or her own
remuneration is being discussed.
The Committee also meets without management and receives
information and independent executive remuneration advice from
external consultancy firms appointed by the Committee. During
2004, Kepler Associates
(a)(b) 
and T owers Perrin
(b)
provided advice to
the Committee on market trends, long-term incentive schemes and
other remuneration issues. In addition, T owers Perrin
(a)
provided
general compensation and benefits advice and information to 
BG Group management and was responsible for the administration
of some of the share schemes. In December 2004, the Committee
appointed Kepler Associates as its independent executive
remuneration advisers. T owers Perrin continue to provide 
general advice and assistance to BG Group management on
executive remuneration. 
Other external advisers also provide support and advice in relation
to executive remuneration to the Committee. Herbert Smith
(a)(b)
provides legal advice and services on share schemes (as well as
other legal services to the Group and to the trustees of the
Ballylumford Power Pension Scheme) and Watson Wyatt
(a)(b)
provides actuarial advice to the Committee, the Group and to the
trustees of the BG Pension Scheme and of the Ballylumford Power
Pension Scheme as well as other general consultancy services to
the Group. These advisers are appointed by management or the
relevant trustees as appropriate.
Remuneration policy
BG Group needs to be able to employ and retain international
employees of the highest calibre with the necessary skills,
capabilities and experience to execute its business strategy and
thereby deliver strong growth. The catchment area for recruitment
is increasingly outside the UK and the required talent is scarce. 
The overriding objectives of our remuneration policy are: 
  to enable the recruitment and retention of this limited
resource; and
  to reinforce our strong performance ethic.
The central premise of the policy is that, while reward arrangements
should be market competitive, employees should look to
performance related incentives rather than base salaries to earn
above average reward. Performance related incentive schemes form
a significant proportion of the total reward package for executives
and are designed to align their interests with those of shareholders
and establish a clear link between pay and performance.
In defining BG Group's remuneration policy, the Committee takes
into account advice received from external consultants and also
best practice guidelines set by institutional shareholder bodies,
including the principles and guidelines on executive remuneration
(a) Kepler Associates, Towers Perrin, Herbert Smith and Watson Wyatt have given,
and not withdrawn, their written consent to the issue of this document with the
inclusion of the reference to their respective names in the form and content in
which they appear. A copy of each consent letter is available for inspection at

(b) Other than in the provision of the services outlined above, none of Kepler
Associates, Towers Perrin, Herbert Smith or Watson Wyatt provides any services
to the Group or has any connection with the Group. (a) TSR is defined as the return on investment obtained from holding a company's
shares over a period. It includes dividends paid, the change in the capital value 
of the shares and other payments to, or by, shareholders within the period.
(b) EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings for the financial year (excluding
exceptional items) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue
and ranking for dividend during the year. EPS is published quarterly when 
BG Group reports its results. For grants made on or after 21 July 2004, the Group's
published EPS is adjusted to take into account the volatility of both commodity
prices and exchange rates. See page 54 for further details.

Remuneration report continued
issued by the Association of British Insurers (ABI). 
To implement our policy, we have a well-developed, Group-wide
performance management system and we operate three
complementary performance related incentive schemes 
for executives:
  the Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS) - designed to focus
executives on the business priorities of the financial year and
to reinforce our individual and Company performance ethic;
  the Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS) - aims to motivate
participants to maximise total shareholder return (TSR)
(a)
as
measured against a comparator group of international oil and
gas companies over a period of three years; and
  the Company Share Option Scheme (CSOS) - aims to drive real
earnings growth over the long term. The mechanism used for
measuring this is the growth in the Group's earnings per share
(EPS)
(b)
relative to the growth in the retail price index,
excluding mortgage interest repayments (RPIX).
The varying performance periods and performance conditions of
the three schemes combine and complement each other to enable
the measurement and reward of both short- and long-term
performance as well as absolute (AIS), sustained (CSOS) and
comparative (LTIS) financial performance. 
The Committee reviews the remuneration policy on a regular basis
and recommends changes as and when appropriate. During the
year, changes were made to the CSOS. Changes were also made 
to the way that the Company operates the CSOS and the LTIS
together. Details of these changes can be found on pages 53 to 54.
During 2005 the Company plans to continue its review of the
CSOS, in particular its use as the primary share-based incentive
vehicle for the broader employee population below senior
management level.
Components of remuneration
The current remuneration package for Executive Directors
comprises performance related and non-performance related
components. The performance related components are the
incentive schemes referred to above and the non-performance
related components are base salary, taxable benefits and pension
entitlements. In addition, the Executive Directors are eligible to
participate in the Company's all-employee share schemes. Pay and
employment conditions elsewhere in the Group have been taken
into account by the Committee in determining the remuneration
packages for Executive Directors and the Committee has also
followed the provisions of Schedule A to the Combined Code which
relates to the design of performance related remuneration.
The proportion of each Executive Director's total remuneration
that is performance related is significant even for target
performance. For stretch performance, the proportion of total
remuneration that is performance related is higher, as is the total
amount of remuneration payable.
In determining the relative importance of those elements of
remuneration which are, and those which are not, performance
related as required by the Regulations, we have made a number 
of assumptions about the Company's share price growth and TSR,
relative to the Company's comparator group, over the next three
years. These assumptions have not changed from last year. Pension
values can vary quite significantly from year to year and from
person to person and are shown separately on page 60. The
average proportion of remuneration (excluding pension) that
is performance related is:
  for target performance - 62%; 
  for stretch performance - 81%. 
This is illustrated by the chart below. 
Base salaries
Executive Directors' salaries are reviewed each year with any
changes taking effect from 1 April. This review takes into account
individual performance and market competitiveness. Pensionable
salary is derived from base salary only. 
In line with our remuneration policy, the Committee benchmarks
Executive Directors' salaries against a comparator group. Given 
BG Group's international presence and position roughly in the
middle of the FTSE 50, the Committee considered it appropriate 
to reference Executive Directors' base salaries for the 2004 salary
review against the median of the FTSE 50. We intend to use the
same comparator group for the 2005 review.
Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS)
The Company operates a cash based annual incentive scheme,
which provides an incentive opportunity in the range of 0% to
100% of base salary.
At the start of the incentive year (1 January), based on the Company's
business priorities, the Committee sets the performance measures and
the Board sets challenging stretch and budget financial performance
targets. Incentives at the higher end of the range are payable only for
demonstrably superior Company and individual performance. During
the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards, the
comparison between actual performance and the targets will be on 
a consistent basis.
For the Executive Directors, the financial performance measures
for the 2004 incentive year were EPS and return on average capital

(a)
. Both these measures were adjusted to take
into account the volatility of upstream prices and the US$/UK 
exchange rate. These measures will also apply for 2005. Stretch
performance was achieved in 2004 on both these measures.
When determining actual incentive payments, the 
Committee considers:
  overall Group performance, including financial performance
and health, safety, security and environmental performance; 
  Group performance relative to peers; and
  individual performance. 
For the 2004 incentive year, taking into account the stretch
financial performance and the above factors, the Committee
decided that the Executive Directors should be awarded AIS
payments of 100% of base salary, representing overall stretch
performance. Payments in respect of the 2004 incentive year were
made in February 2005. Payments under the AIS are non-pensionable.
Long-term incentives 
Estimated Present Value (EPV)
EPV is a measure which describes the value, at the time of grant or
allocation, of long-term incentives which may, or may not, pay out
in the future.
This measure, which is based on generally accepted remuneration
practice, takes account of the performance conditions and the risk
that grants and allocations may be forfeited. This EPV is then used
to determine the appropriate levels of face value CSOS grants and
LTIS allocations.
As agreed by shareholders at our Annual General Meeting in 2002,
the Committee is able to make awards under both schemes, up to
a maximum combined EPV of 175% of base salary each year. The
actual maximum combined EPV granted during 2004 was 167%.
Blend of CSOS and LTIS
Each year, the Committee decides on the appropriate blend of
CSOS grants and LTIS allocations to be made to Executive Directors
within the maximum combined EPV. Awards will always be made
under both schemes. During 2004, the Committee reviewed this
blend of CSOS grants and LTIS allocations. For 2001, 2002 and 2003
the Committee restricted the mix such that not less than one-third
and not more than two-thirds of the total combined EPV was
delivered by either scheme. To provide more flexibility in the
future, the Committee considered it appropriate to modify the
restriction on the mix between LTIS and CSOS so that not less than
20% and not more than 80% of the total combined EPV will be
delivered by either scheme. The maximum combined EPV of 175%
of base salary has not changed.
When making the decision on the exact mix, the Committee 
takes into consideration a number of factors including cost, the
performance conditions considered to be key to BG Group's
strategy at the time of the allocation or grant and the need to
remain within scheme dilution limits.
Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS)
A limited number of employees are allocated Company shares
under the LTIS. This allocation marks the beginning of a three year
performance period. The Company's TSR performance against that
of a comparator group over the three year period will determine
what proportion of the allocated shares will be transferred into 
the ownership of the employee. The Committee considers that
measuring performance against a comparator group of companies
ensures that executives are rewarded based on BG Group's
performance relative to the performance of the other companies
in the comparator group. During 2004, the TSR performance was
measured by the independent TSR monitoring service of Alithos
Limited and reviewed by Kepler Associates.
The LTIS comparator group for the 2002, 2003 and 2004 allocations
comprises 21 international oil and gas companies (including 
BG Group plc) of which 12 are headquartered in the USA, three in
the UK and six elsewhere in Europe
(b)
. This group has been chosen
because the Committee believes that it comprises our major
business competitors - in other words, those companies against
which BG Group is compared by shareholders.
The other companies in the comparator group are as follows: 
Amerada Hess El Paso Corporation Repsol YPF SA
Corporation
Anadarko Petroleum ENI SpA Royal Dutch 
Corporation Petroleum Co.
BP plc Exxon Mobil Shell Transport & 
Corporation Trading Co. plc
Burlington Kerr-McGee Statoil ASA
Resources Inc. Corporation
Chevron Texaco Marathon Oil Total SA
Corporation Corporation
ConocoPhillips Norsk Hydro ASA Unocal 
Corporation
Duke Energy Occidental Petroleum
Corporation Corporation
The Committee has set the following performance conditions for
the 2002, 2003 and 2004 allocations:
BG Group's TSR position in 
comparator group % of allocated shares transferred
Top 100
Upper Quartile 75
Median 30
Below Median All allocated shares are forfeited
Where performance is between Upper Quartile (UQ) and Top (T), 
or between Median (M) and UQ, the percentage of shares to be
transferred is determined on a proportionate basis.

(a) Average capital employed consists of total shareholders' funds plus net
borrowings averaged between the start and end of year. ROACE represents 
profits before tax (excluding exceptional items) plus net interest payable on 
net borrowings as a percentage of average capital employed.
(b) A different comparator group was used for the 2001 allocation. BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004

Remuneration report continued
These performance conditions are illustrated by the graph below:
LTIS performance conditions
% of allocated shares transferred
Shares allocated under the 2000 LTIS scheme were transferred 
to eligible employees on 11 November 2004 when the one year
retention period ended.
The performance period for the 2001 allocation ended on 
21 November 2004. BG Group's final TSR for this period relative to
the TSRs of companies in the relevant comparator group placed it
in the upper quartile. The Committee decided, in accordance with
the performance conditions for the 2001 allocation, that 100% of
the original allocation of shares had vested and, accordingly, these
shares were put into trust on behalf of participating employees.
Subject to the rules of the LTIS, these shares will be transferred 
to those employees at the end of the retention period in 
November 2005.
There is no retention period for the 2002, 2003 and 2004 
LTIS allocations. 
There is no retest provision under the LTIS rules. In the event
of a change of control, vesting of shares under the LTIS is not
automatic and would depend upon the extent to which the
performance conditions had been met at the time.
Company Share Option Scheme (CSOS)
Approximately 1 600 employees are currently eligible to participate
in the CSOS, including UK payroll employees and overseas
employees above a certain level of seniority. 
The Company grants an option over its shares to each eligible
employee and the option price is set at the fair market value at
the time of the grant. As described below, the CSOS measures
performance according to EPS growth relative to the growth in the
Retail Price Index, excluding mortgage interest repayments (RPIX).
The Committee considers that an EPS performance measure
ensures that executives receive rewards only when the Company
has achieved sustained earnings growth during the performance
period. In July 2004, the Committee decided to adjust the
calculation of EPS growth for future grants by using constant
commodity prices and constant exchange rates. The Committee
considers that these adjustments will strengthen the link between
performance and reward by reducing sensitivity to external
uncontrollable factors.
During the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards,
EPS growth figures will be calculated on a consistent basis. 
To the extent that the performance target has been met three
years from the date of grant, the option may be exercised (in
whole or in part) at any time up to the expiry of ten years from 
the date of grant.
The Committee has decided to remove retests for grants made on
or after 21 July 2004. For grants made in 2002 and 2003, fixed point
retesting is currently allowed in years four and five, but in this
event EPS growth of RPIX plus 40% or 50% respectively must be
achieved for all of the options to become exercisable. At the end of
year five, the options will be exercisable only to the extent that the
performance condition has been met. 
As in 2003, the levels of grant made to individual employees in
2004 were differentiated based on each individual's performance
to date and expectation of future contributions. For the 2004
grant, the Committee set the following performance targets:
EPS growth over RPIX (over 3 years) % of option that is exercisable
30% or greater 100
15% 50
Less than 15% Option is forfeited
A proportion of between half and all of the option will be
exercisable if the Company achieves EPS growth over three years 
of RPIX plus between 15% and 30%.
These are the same as the targets which apply to the 2002 and
2003 grants (and applied to the 2001 grant) and are considered by
the Committee to be particularly demanding. These performance
targets are illustrated by the graph below:
CSOS performance conditions
% of option exercisable
Over the three year performance period for the 2001 CSOS grant,
the Company's EPS growth above the growth in the RPIX exceeded
30%. As a result, 100% of the shares under option granted to
employees in November 2001 are exercisable prior to November
2011. For the 2000 grant, the performance achieved resulted in
100% of the shares under option becoming exercisable prior to
November 2010.
In the event of a change of control, exercise of the option under
the CSOS is not automatic and would depend upon the extent to
which the performance condition had been satisfied at the time. 
No CSOS options were exercised by Directors during the year.
All-Employee Share Schemes
In order to encourage share ownership, the Company currently
provides two all-employee share schemes for its UK employees, 
the Share Incentive Plan and the Sharesave Scheme.
Share Incentive Plan (SIP) 
The BG Group SIP is approved by the Inland Revenue. There are
two parts to the SIP - the Partnership Shares Plan and the Free
Shares Plan.
(a) Partnership Shares
Eligible employees are offered the opportunity to buy Company
shares from pre-tax earnings as part of a regular share purchase
plan. Shares are currently purchased every six months using
employees' accumulated deductions and are placed in trust.

At 31 December 2004, 63% of eligible employees were participating
in this plan, contributing an average monthly payment of  107. 
Of those participating, 75% were contributing the maximum of 
 125 per month.
(b) Free Shares
A Free Shares award of 904 shares, representing the value of the 
 3 000 statutory limit, was made on 7 April 2004 to all eligible
employees in the UK based on the Group's performance during
2003. These shares will be held in trust for up to five years. 
For 2004, the Committee may approve the award of Free Shares 
in the Company up to the statutory limit for each individual. All
eligible employees will receive the same number of shares. This
number will be determined based on the Group's performance
during 2004.
Sharesave Scheme
The Company continued to operate the BG Group Sharesave
Scheme in 2004. The scheme is approved by the Inland Revenue
and enables eligible employees to acquire the Company's shares
with the proceeds of a monthly savings contract. The contract
period is three or five years. At 31 December 2004, 78% of eligible
employees were participating in the Sharesave Scheme, contributing
an average monthly payment of  200. Of those participating, 62%
were contributing the statutory maximum of  250 per month.
Employee Profit Sharing Scheme
This scheme ceased to operate at the end of 2000. During 2004,
shares allocated to participants in respect of the 2000 scheme
were released and transferred into their names. 
Dilution
The ABI has published guidelines relating to the disclosure of the
percentage of a company's issued share capital that can be issued
to employees under share schemes. In the event of all shares
outstanding as at 31 December 2004 under BG Group's CSOS 
and Sharesave Schemes (which involve the issue of new shares)
becoming exercisable, the resulting issue of shares would
represent less than 1.62% of the issued share capital as at that date.
Shareholding guidelines
The Committee has adopted guidelines for Executive Directors,
Group Executive Committee members and certain other senior
employees to encourage substantial long-term share ownership.
These require that, over a period of five years from the introduction
of the guidelines in 2002 (or date of appointment, if later),
Executive Directors build up, and then retain, a holding of shares
with a value equivalent to 200% of base salary. The required holding
for other members of the Group Executive Committee is 100% of
base salary and for certain other senior employees is 50% of base
salary. The guidelines require that, in relation to the 2002 and later
LTIS allocations, vested shares (net of tax) should be retained by the
individual until the required shareholding level is reached.
Service contracts
The Executive Directors' service contracts, including arrangements
for early termination, are carefully considered by the Remuneration
Committee and are designed to recruit, retain and motivate
Directors of the quality required to manage the Company. The
Committee considers that a notice period of one year is appropriate. 
The Executive Directors' service contracts contain change of control
provisions. Should the Directors' employment be terminated within
12 months of a change of control, they are entitled to liquidated
damages. The amount of liquidated damages is equal to one year's
gross salary and a credit of one year's pensionable service (less 
any deductions the employer is required to make), which the
Committee considers to be a genuine pre-estimate of loss. The
Committee considers that these provisions assist with recruitment
and retention and that their inclusion is therefore in the best
interests of shareholders.
Other than change of control, the Executive Directors' service
contracts do not contain provisions for compensation in the event
of early termination. When calculating termination payments 
the Committee takes into account a variety of factors, including
individual and Company performance, the obligation for the
Director to mitigate his or her own loss (for example, by gaining
new employment) and the Director's age and length of service.
Further details of the Executive Directors' service contracts can 
be found on page 57.
Senior Executives below the Executive Directors
The Committee reviews and approves the individual remuneration
packages for the Group Executive Committee members and the
Company Secretary in accordance with the overriding objectives 
of our remuneration policy. Our policy and practice with regard 
to the remuneration of employees below the Executive Directors 
is entirely consistent with that for the Executive Directors. These
senior executives all have a significant portion of their reward
package linked to performance. They all qualify for AIS, CSOS 
and LTIS, and their financial targets are the same as or cascaded
from the targets for the Executive Directors. Their individual
performance is reviewed and their base salary increases, AIS
payments, and CSOS and LTIS awards are subject to approval
by the Committee each year.
Non-Executive Directors
The Board aims to recruit non-executive Directors of a high 
calibre with broad commercial, international or other relevant
experience. Non-executive Directors are appointed by the Board 
on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee. Their
appointment is for an initial term of three years, subject to
election by shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting
(AGM) following their appointment. They are generally
reappointed for a second term of three years, subject to re-election
by shareholders. There is no notice period and no provision for
termination payments. The terms of engagement of the non-
executive Directors are set out in a letter of appointment.
Non-executive Directors (other than the Chairman) are paid a 
basic annual fee of  55 000. Additional fees are also payable, for
example, for membership of, or chairing, a committee of the Board
or acting as Deputy Chairman. Fees are reviewed annually, taking
into account time commitment, competition for high quality 
non-executive Directors and market movements.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the
Company's share schemes, incentive schemes or pension schemes.  BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004

Chairman
Sir Robert Wilson was appointed as Chairman with effect from 
1 January 2004. In line with the other non-executive Directors, 
Sir Robert's appointment is for an initial three year term and there
is no notice period and no provision for payment in the event of
early termination. Sir Robert Wilson is paid a fee of  500 000 per
annum, which is next subject to review in July 2005.
Performance graph
The graph on the right shows BG Group's TSR performance for the
five year period ended 31 December 2004 (calculated in accordance
with the Regulations) against the performance of the FTSE 100. We
have chosen the FTSE 100 because this is a recognised broad equity
market index of which the Company is a member.

(a) Other than the change of control provisions, the Executive Directors' service contracts do not contain provisions for compensation payable upon early termination.
Change of control
As described on page 55, the Executive Directors' service contracts contain change of control provisions.
For the purposes of these provisions, a change of control is deemed to occur if the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company; 
or if 50% or more of the voting rights of the Company or the right to appoint or remove the majority of the Board of the Company become
vested in any individual or body or group of individuals or bodies acting in concert; or if all or substantially all of the business, assets and
undertakings of the Company become owned by any person, firm or company (other than a subsidiary or associated company). A change
of control is also deemed to occur if the whole of the issued capital of BG Energy Holdings Limited or a substantial part of the undertaking
of that company (including its subsidiaries) is transferred to another company, unless that transferee company is a subsidiary of the
Company, or a company ultimately owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the ultimate owners of the Company. 
However, a change of control does not occur if (and only if) through a process of reconstruction the Company becomes a subsidiary 
of another company owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the shareholders of the Company. The Executive Directors'
service contracts provide that any payments made pursuant to these provisions will be made less any deductions the employer 
is required to make. Any such payments shall be in full and final settlement of any claims the Executive Director may have against the
employer or any associated company arising out of the termination of employment except for any personal injury claim, any claim in
respect of accrued pension rights or statutory employment protection claims.

On 28 February 2005, Baroness Hogg notified the Company that she has a beneficial interest in 5 904 ordinary shares of the Company.
There have been no other changes in the interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company or any of its subsidiary
undertakings between 1 January 2005 and 7 March 2005.
As of 7 March 2005, the Directors' interests in the share capital of the Company represent less than 1% of the issued share capital 
of the Company.
PENSIONS
Frank Chapman, William Friedrich and Ashley Almanza were members of the BG Pension Scheme throughout the year. The benefits
provided for them under the BG Pension Scheme are subject to the earnings cap, which is a restriction on the amount of pay that can 
be used to calculate pensions payable from a UK tax approved pension scheme. Consequently, retirement benefits (including contingent
death benefits) that are not covered by the BG Pension Scheme are provided by the Company under an unapproved arrangement, the 
BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme. Provision has been made in respect of the additional obligations for these post-retirement benefits.
The arrangements for all the Executive Directors have not changed during the year. They provide an accrual of benefits designed to target
a pension equivalent to two-thirds of their final 12 months' salary on retirement from BG Group at age 60, inclusive of retained benefits. 
As for all members of the BG Pension Scheme, if the Company consents to retirement, no actuarial reduction is applied to pensions payable
from age 55, provided 10 years' service has been completed with the Group (which includes pensionable service transferred from previous
employment). Pensions in payment are increased in line with retail price inflation. An adult dependant's pension is payable on death in
service, equal to two-thirds of that payable to the pension scheme member based on potential service to retirement age. On death in
retirement, an adult dependant's pension is payable equal to two-thirds of the member's pension prior to exchanging any of it for a cash
lump sum.
A new pensions taxation regime comes into force from April 2006 and the Company is reviewing the effect that this will have on its
current arrangements.
Directors' pension provisions were as follows:

(c) The transfer values shown at the end of 2003 and 2004 represent the value of each Executive Director's accrued pension based on total service completed to the relevant
date. The accrued pensions are the amounts that would have been paid if the Executive Director had left service at the relevant date. The transfer values have been
calculated in accordance with guidance note  GN11' issued by the Institute of Actuaries and Faculty of Actuaries.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
To broaden the experience of Executive Directors, it is Company policy to allow each of them to accept one external appointment
as a non-executive director of another company, the fees for which would be retained by the individual Director.
