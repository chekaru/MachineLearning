(a) Other than the change of control provisions, the Executive Directors' service contracts do n ot contain provisions for compensation payable upon early termination.
Changeofcontrol
As described on page 55, the Executive Directors' service contracts contain change of control provisions.
For the purposes of these provisions, a change of control is deemed to occur if the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company;
or if 50% or more of the voting rights of the Company or the right to appoint or remove the majority of the Board of the Company become
vested in any individual or body or group of individuals or bodies acting in concert; or if all or substantially all of the business, assets and
undertakings of the Company become owned by any person, firm or company (other than a subsidiary or associated company). A change of
control is also deemed to occur if the whole of the issued capital of BG Energy Holdings Limited or a substantial part of the undertaking of
that company (including its subsidiaries) is transferred to another company, unless that transferee company is a subsidiary of the Company,
or a company ultimately owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the ultimate owners of the Company.
However, a change of control does not occur if (and only if) through a process of reconstruction the Company becomes a subsidiary of
another company owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the shareholders of the Company. The Executive Directors' service
contracts provide that any payments made pursuant to these provisions will be made less any deductions the employer is required to make.
Any such payments shall be in full and final settlement of any claims the Executive Director may have against the employer or any
associated company arising out of the termination of employment except for any personal injury claim, any claim in respect of accrued
pension rights or statutory employment protection claims.
