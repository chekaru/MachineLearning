Remuneration report 59
Dear Shareholder, 
On behalf of the Board, I am delighted to present the Directors' 
report on remuneration for 2006, for which we will be seeking 
approval from shareholders at our Annual General Meeting.  
The Remuneration Committee is focused on ensuring the 
remuneration policy enables BG Group to attract, retain and 
motivate the executive talent required for the successful delivery  
of our integrated gas strategy.  
During 2006, the Committee reviewed the Group's approach to 
executive remuneration against the international oil and gas market 
in which we compete for talent. Following consultation with our 
major shareholders, changes have been made to the maximum 
awards that can be granted under our annual incentive scheme for 
2007 and minor modifications have been made to our long-term 
share-based schemes (see page 60). These changes are within the 
pre-approved limits and fully in accordance with our pay for 
performance policy.  
We will continue to review the fiercely competitive oil and gas 
market to ensure that our approach aligns executive remuneration 
with the interests of our shareholders.  
Baroness Hogg 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

REMUNERATION POLICY 
The central premise of BG Group's remuneration policy is that, while 
reward arrangements should be market competitive, employees 
should look to performance-related incentives rather than base 
salaries to earn above-average reward. Performance-related 
incentive schemes form a significant proportion of the total reward 
package for executives and are designed to align their interests  
with those of shareholders and establish a clear link between pay 
and performance. 
In defining BG Group's remuneration policy, the Committee takes 
into account advice received from external consultants and also best 
practice guidelines set by institutional shareholder bodies, including 
the principles and guidelines on executive remuneration issued by 
the Association of British Insurers (ABI).  
To implement the policy, BG Group has a well-developed,  
Group-wide performance management system and operates  
three complementary performance-related incentive schemes  
for executives: 
 the Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS) - designed to focus executives 
on the business priorities of the financial year and to reinforce 
the individual and Company performance ethic; 
 the Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS) - aims to motivate 
participants to maximise total shareholder return (TSR)
(a)
 as 
measured against a comparator group of international oil  
and gas companies over a period of three years; and 
 the Company Share Option Scheme (CSOS) - aims to drive real 
earnings growth over the long term. The mechanism used for 
measuring this is the growth in the Group's earnings per share 
(EPS)
(b)
 relative to the growth in the Retail Price Index, excluding 
mortgage interest repayments (RPIX). 
The performance periods and performance conditions of the three 
schemes complement each other to enable the measurement and 
reward of both short- and long-term performance including 
absolute (AIS), comparative (LTIS) and sustained (CSOS) financial 
performance. The Committee considers that the three-year vesting 
period for the LTIS and the CSOS is appropriate.  
REVIEW OF REMUNERATION 
During the year, the Committee reviewed the remuneration 
arrangements for Executive Directors. Remuneration was 
benchmarked on a total reward basis (i.e. including salaries, 
incentives and pensions) against the FTSE 30 (excluding financial 
services companies) and the international oil and gas companies  
in our LTIS comparator group.  
                                                                                    
(a) TSR is defined as the return on investment obtained from holding a company's 
shares over a period. It includes dividends paid, the change in the capital value 
of the shares and other payments to, or by, shareholders within the period. TSR 
is calculated on a common currency basis to ensure that international 
comparisons are fair. 
(b) EPS is published quarterly when BG Group reports its results. For grants made 
on or after 21 July 2004, the Group's published EPS is adjusted to take into 
account the volatility of both commodity prices and exchange rates. See page 61 
for further details. 
The Committee decided to make certain changes to the incentive 
arrangements for Executive Directors in order for BG Group to 
maintain its competitive position: 
 For 2007, the maximum annual incentive opportunity for the 
Chief Executive will be increased from 100% to 150% of salary, 
and for the other Executive Directors from 100% to 125% of salary. 
Superior levels of performance will be required to achieve these 
new higher incentive levels.  
 For 2006, the CSOS and LTIS awards were subject to their 
individual scheme limits of 400% of salary. The previously 
applied Estimated Present Value (EPV) limit, of a combined 
award of CSOS and LTIS of up to 175% of salary, was removed.  
 For 2006 LTIS awards onwards, dividends paid during the 
performance period accrue on those shares that vest. This will 
provide a closer link between shareholder returns and payments 
to the Executives.  
During the year, the Committee also reviewed all share-based 
schemes to ensure compliance with the Employment Equality (Age) 
Regulations 2006 (the Age Regulations ).  
The Committee approved changes to the grant policy for the LTIS 
and CSOS and to the rules of the Sharesave Scheme, the LTIS and  
the CSOS: 
 For 2006 awards onwards, grants under the CSOS and  
LTIS are made without reference to age or to length of  
expected employment.  
 For 2006 awards onwards, the rules of the CSOS have been 
amended and aligned with the rules of the LTIS so that time pro-
rating will normally apply on early vesting. Early vesting in both 
schemes remains subject to the achievement of the applicable 
performance conditions. 
During 2007, the Committee will continue to review the operation 
of the incentive schemes to ensure optimal performance alignment 
and to ensure continued compliance with regulations.  
COMPONENTS OF REMUNERATION 
The current remuneration package for Executive Directors 
comprises performance-related and non-performance-related 
components. The performance-related components are the 
incentive schemes referred to above and the non-performance-
related components are base salary, taxable benefits and pension 
entitlements. In addition, the Executive Directors are eligible to 
participate in the Company's all-employee share schemes. Pay and 
employment conditions elsewhere in the Group have been taken 
into account by the Committee in determining the remuneration 
packages for Executive Directors. The Committee has also followed 
the provisions of Schedule A to the Combined Code that relate to 
the design of performance-related remuneration. 
The proportion of each Executive Director's total remuneration that 
is performance-related is significant even for target performance. 
For stretch performance, the proportion of total remuneration that 
is performance-related is higher, as is the total amount of 
remuneration payable.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
61
The average proportion of remuneration (including pension) that
was performance-related in 2006 is illustrated by the chart below.
In estimating the relative importance of those elements of
remuneration that are, and those that are not, performance-related,
as required by the Regulations, a number of assumptions have
had to be made about the Company's share price growth and
TSR, relative to the Company's comparator group, over the next
three years.

Base salaries
Executive Directors' salaries are reviewed each year, with any
changes normally taking effect from 1 April. This review takes
into account individual performance, experience and market
competitiveness. Pensionable salary is derived from base salary only.
In line with our remuneration policy, the Committee benchmarks
Executive Directors' salaries against a comparator group, which, for
the 2006 salary review, was the FTSE 30 excluding financial services
companies. Following the review, the salaries for the Chief Executive
and Chief Financial Officer were below the median of this group.
The Deputy Chief Executive position was benchmarked against a
composite of Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer positions,
taking into account the skills and experience in the role. The
Committee is satisfied that this is the most appropriate benchmark
for this position.
Annual Incentive Scheme
The Group operates a cash-based annual incentive scheme, which in
2006 provided an incentive opportunity in the range of 0 to 100% of
base salary.
At the start of the incentive year (1 January), the Board sets
challenging budget and stretch financial performance targets and
the Committee endorses other performance measures, notably with
respect to health, safety and environmental indicators. Bonuses at
the higher end of the range are payable only for demonstrably
superior Group and individual performance.
For the Executive Directors, the performance measures for the 2006
incentive year were EPS
(a)
, return on average capital employed
(b)
(a) Actual results are adjusted to exclude the volatility of upstream prices, the US$/UK 
exchange rate, the volatility of US natural gas prices on contracted LNG cargoes and
the Comgas regulatory current account.
(b) Average capital employed consists of total shareholders' funds plus commodity
financial instruments (including associated deferred tax) and net funds/ (borrowings),
averaged between the start and the end of the year. Actual average capital employed
is adjusted to exclude the volatility of upstream prices and the US$/UK  exchange
rate. Return on average capital employed represents profit after tax (excluding
disposals, re-measurements and impairments) plus net finance costs.

Weighting of 2006 performance metrics for Executive Directors

85%
In determining the actual incentive payment, the Committee
considers these results against the context of the overall
performance of the business and of the individual. The review of
the overall performance of the business takes into consideration
such factors as operational performance, strategy and business
development activities and performance against industry peers.
The review of individual performance takes into consideration
achievements against the individual's personal performance contract.
For the 2006 incentive year, financial performance against both the
EPS and ROACE targets was rated as stretch and performance
against the HSE balanced scorecard was rated as strong. Taking into
account these results and overall business and individual
performance, the Committee awarded the Chief Executive, the
Deputy Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer AIS payments
of 100% of base salary. Payments in respect of the 2006 incentive
year were made in March 2007.
The Committee has decided that the same performance measures
will apply to the AIS for 2007.
Long-term incentives
When making the decision on the level of award, the Committee
takes into consideration a number of factors including Face Value,
Estimated Present Value (EPV) and scheme dilution limits.
The Face Value of an award is equal to the number of shares, or
shares under option, multiplied by the relevant share price. The
relevant share price of an LTIS award is the average share price for
the calendar year immediately prior to the date of grant. The
relevant share price for a CSOS award is the average share price for
the three dealing days immediately prior to the date of award.
The rules of the LTIS and CSOS each permit a maximum award with
a Face Value equal to 400% of salary in each year. The maximum
combined award granted during 2006 was 368% of salary in LTIS
and 400% of salary in CSOS.
EPV is a measure that describes the economic or fair value of an
award. The measure, which is based on generally accepted
The adjustments in (a) and (b) are independently reviewed.

and lagging indicators reflecting the Group's commitment to HSE.

remuneration practice, takes account of the performance conditions 
and the risk that grants and allocations may be forfeited.  
Long Term Incentive Scheme  
A limited number of key employees are allocated Company shares 
under the LTIS. This allocation marks the beginning of a three-year 
performance period. The Company's TSR performance against that 
of a comparator group of companies over the three-year period will 
determine what proportion of the allocated shares will be 
transferred into the ownership of the employee. There is no retest 
provision. The Committee considers that measuring performance 
against a comparator group of companies ensures that executives 
are rewarded based on BG Group's performance relative to the 
performance of the other companies in the comparator group. 
In the event of a change of control, vesting of shares under the LTIS 
is not automatic and would depend upon the extent to which the 
performance conditions had been met at the time. 
For the 2003 and 2004 LTIS allocations, the comparator group 
comprised 21 companies, including BG Group plc. The Committee 
considered that this group represented an appropriate set of 
international oil and gas companies against which the performance 
of BG Group could be compared by shareholders. 
For the 2005 allocation, the group was reduced to 19, due to the 
merger of Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. and Shell Transport and 
Trading Co. plc to form Royal Dutch Shell plc and the acquisition  
of Unocal Corporation by Chevron Texaco Corporation (now called 
Chevron Corporation). 
For the 2006 allocation, the group was further reduced to 17, due  
to the acquisition of Burlington Resources Inc. by ConocoPhillips  
and the acquisition of Kerr-McGee Corporation by Anadarko 
Petroleum Corporation.  
The other companies in the comparator group are currently  
as follows: 
Anadarko 
Petroleum 
Corporation ENI S.p.A. 
Royal Dutch Shell 
plc 
BP plc 
Exxon Mobil 
Corporation Repsol YPF S.A. 
Chevron 
Corporation 
Hess Corporation 
(formerly Amerada 
Hess Corporation) Statoil ASA 
ConocoPhillips 
Marathon Oil 
Corporation Total S.A. 
Duke Energy 
Corporation Norsk Hydro ASA  
El Paso  
Corporation 
Occidental 
Petroleum 
Corporation  
Of these companies, nine are headquartered in the USA, one in the 
UK and six elsewhere in Europe. 
The Committee reviews this comparator group from time to time 
and intends to do so before making future allocations under the LTIS. 
The Committee has set the following performance conditions for 
allocations made under the LTIS: 
BG Group's TSR position  
in comparator group % of allocated shares transferred 
Top 100 
Upper Quartile 75 
Median 30 
Below Median All allocated shares are forfeited 
Where performance is between Upper Quartile (UQ) and Top (T)  
or between Median (M) and UQ, the percentage of shares to be 
transferred is determined on a proportionate basis. 
These performance conditions are illustrated by the graph below: 
30
75
100
T UQ M
LTIS performance conditions
% of allocated shares transferred
 
The performance period for the 2003 allocation ended on 
4 September 2006. BG Group's final TSR for this period relative  
to the TSRs of companies in the relevant comparator group was 
measured by the independent TSR monitoring service of Alithos 
Limited and reviewed by Kepler Associates. This analysis placed  
BG Group in 6
th
 position. The Committee therefore decided, in 
accordance with the performance condition for the 2003 allocation, 
that 75% of the original allocation of shares had vested and, 
accordingly, these shares were transferred to the participating 
employees on 6 September 2006.  
Company Share Option Scheme  
Approximately 2 300 employees are currently eligible to participate 
in the CSOS, including all UK payroll employees and those overseas 
employees above a certain grade.  
The Company grants an option over its shares to each eligible 
employee and the option price is set at the fair market value at  
the time of the grant. As described below, the CSOS measures 
performance according to EPS growth relative to the growth in the 
RPIX. The Committee considers that an EPS performance measure 
ensures that employees receive rewards only when the Company 
has achieved sustained earnings growth during the performance 
period. The calculation of EPS growth for grants made on or after 
21 July 2004 has been made using constant commodity prices and 
constant exchange rates.  
 
During the transition to IFRS, EPS growth figures are being 
calculated on a consistent basis by restating prior years' results  
in compliance with IFRS.  
To the extent that the performance target has been met three years 
from the date of grant, the option may be exercised (in whole or in 
part) at any time up to the expiry of ten years from the date of grant. 
For grants made on or after 21 July 2004, there is no retest provision.   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
 
63
As in prior years, the levels of grant made to individual employees in 
2006 were differentiated based on each individual's performance to 
date and expectation of future contributions. For the 2006 grant, 
the Committee set the following performance targets: 
EPS growth over RPIX (over 3 years) % of option that is exercisable 
30% or greater 100 
15% 50 
Less than 15% Option is forfeited 
A proportion of between half and all of the options will be 
exercisable if the Company achieves EPS growth over three years  
of RPIX plus between 15% and 30%, respectively. 
These targets are the same as those which apply to the 2004 and 
2005 grants (and which applied to the 2003 grant) and are 
considered by the Committee to be particularly demanding.  
These performance targets are illustrated by the graph below: 
% EPS growth over three years in excess of RPIX
50
100
30% 15%
CSOS performance conditions
% of option exercisable
 
Over the three year performance period for the 2003 CSOS grant, the 
Company's EPS growth above the growth in the RPIX exceeded 30%. 
As a result, 100% of the shares under option granted to employees in 
September 2003 are exercisable prior to September 2013.  
In the event of a change of control, exercise of an option under the 
CSOS is not automatic and would depend upon the extent to which 
the performance condition had been satisfied at the time.  
All-employee share schemes 
In order to encourage share ownership, the Company currently 
provides two all-employee share schemes for its UK employees,  
the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) and the Sharesave Scheme. 
Share Incentive Plan  
The BG Group SIP is approved by HM Revenue & Customs. There  
are two parts to the SIP - the Partnership Shares Plan and the  
Free Shares Plan. 
(a) Partnership Shares 
Eligible employees are offered the opportunity to buy Company 
shares from pre-tax earnings as part of a regular share purchase 
plan. Shares are currently purchased every six months using 
employees' accumulated deductions and are placed in trust.  
At 31 December 2006, 62% of eligible employees were participating 
in this plan. Of those participating, 75% were contributing the 
maximum of  125 per month. 
(b) Free Shares 
A Free Shares award of a maximum of 388 shares, representing the 
value of the  3 000 statutory limit, was made on 25 April 2006 to all 
eligible employees in the UK, based on the Group's performance 
during 2005. These shares will be held in trust for up to five years.  
For 2006, the Committee may approve the award of Free Shares in 
the Company up to the statutory limit for each individual. All eligible 
employees will receive the same number of shares. This number will 
be determined based on the Group's performance during 2006. 
Sharesave Scheme 
The Company continued to operate the BG Group Sharesave 
Scheme in 2006. The scheme is approved by HM Revenue & 
Customs and enables eligible employees to acquire the Company's 
shares with the proceeds of a monthly savings contract. The 
contract period is three or five years. At 31 December 2006, 67% of 
eligible employees were participating in the Sharesave Scheme, 
contributing an average monthly payment of  218. Of those 
participating, 71% were contributing the statutory maximum  
of  250 per month. 
PENSIONS 
The pension arrangements for Executive Directors are detailed  
on page 68. 
As detailed in note 29, page 111, BG Group operates a number of 
pension plans across the Group. Outside the UK, these plans are 
generally defined contribution (or money purchase) arrangements. 
The UK plan is a defined benefit arrangement.  
The Committee is mindful of the potential risks associated with 
operating a defined benefit pension scheme and is taking active 
steps to mitigate these risks. During the course of 2007, a defined 
contribution scheme will be introduced in the UK for new hires.  
DILUTION 
The ABI has published guidelines relating to the disclosure of the 
percentage of a company's issued share capital that can be issued  
to employees under share schemes. In the event of all options 
outstanding as at 31 December 2006 under BG Group's CSOS and 
Sharesave Schemes (which involve the issue of new shares) 
becoming exercisable, the resulting issue of shares would represent 
less than 1.78% of the issued share capital as at that date. 
SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES 
The Committee has adopted guidelines for Executive Directors, 
Group Executive Committee members and certain other senior 
employees to encourage substantial long-term share ownership. 
These require that, over a period of five years from the introduction 
of the guidelines in 2002 (or date of appointment, if later), Executive 
Directors build up, and then retain, a holding of shares with a value 
equivalent to 200% of base salary. The required holding for other 
members of the Group Executive Committee is 100% of base salary 
and for certain other senior employees is 50% of base salary. The 
guidelines require that, in relation to the 2002 and later LTIS 
allocations, vested shares (net of tax) should be retained by the 
individual until the required shareholding level is reached.   
Remuneration report continued

SERVICE CONTRACTS 
The Executive Directors' service contracts, including arrangements 
for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee and 
are designed to recruit, retain and motivate Directors of the quality 
required to manage the Group. The Committee considers that a 
notice period of one year is appropriate.  
The Executive Directors' service contracts contain change of control 
provisions. Should the Directors' employment be terminated within 
12 months of a change of control, they are entitled to liquidated 
damages. The amount of liquidated damages is equal to one year's 
gross salary and a credit of one year's pensionable service (less any 
deductions the employer is required to make), which the Committee 
considers to be a genuine pre-estimate of loss. The Committee 
considers that these provisions assist with recruitment and 
retention and that their inclusion is therefore in the best interests  
of shareholders. 
Other than change of control, the Executive Directors' service 
contracts do not contain provisions for compensation in the event  
of early termination. When calculating termination payments the 
Committee takes into account a variety of factors, including 
individual and Group performance, the obligation for the Director  
to mitigate his or her own loss (for example, by gaining new 
employment) and the Director's length of service. Further details of 
the Executive Directors' service contracts can be found on page 65. 
SENIOR EXECUTIVES BELOW THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
The policy and practice with regard to the remuneration of senior 
employees below the Executive Directors is entirely consistent with 
that for the Executive Directors. These senior executives all have a 
significant portion of their reward package linked to performance. 
They all qualify for AIS, CSOS and LTIS, and their financial targets  
are the same as, or cascaded from, the targets for the Executive 
Directors. The Committee reviews and approves the individual 
remuneration packages for the Group Executive Committee 
members and the Company Secretary in accordance with the 
overriding objectives of our remuneration policy. Their individual 
performance is reviewed and their base salary increases, AIS 
payments, and CSOS and LTIS awards are subject to approval by  
the Committee each year. 
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
The Board aims to recruit non-executive Directors of a high calibre 
with broad commercial, international or other relevant experience. 
Non-executive Directors are appointed by the Board on the 
recommendation of the Nominations Committee. Their 
appointment is for an initial term of three years, subject to election 
by shareholders at the first AGM following their appointment.  
Upon the recommendation of the Nominations Committee, they  
are generally re-appointed for a second term of three years, subject 
to re-election by shareholders. There is no notice period and no 
provision for termination payments.  
The terms of engagement of the non-executive Directors are set out 
in a letter of appointment. 
Following a review during the year, the basic fee paid to non-
executive Directors was reviewed and raised to  65 000 per annum, 
effective from 1 July 2006. Additional fees are also payable, for 
example, for membership of, or chairing, a committee of the Board 
or acting as Senior Independent Director. Fees are reviewed every 
two years, taking into account time commitment, competition for 
high quality non-executive directors and market movements. 
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the 
Company's share schemes, incentive schemes or pension schemes. 
 
CHAIRMAN 
Sir Robert Wilson was initially appointed as Chairman with  
effect from 1 January 2004 and was re-appointed with effect  
from 1 January 2007. In line with the non-executive Directors, his  
re-appointment is for a three year term and there is no notice period

(a) Other than the change of control provisions, the Executive Directors' service contracts do not contain provisions for compensation payable upon early termination. 
Change of control 
As described on page 64, the Executive Directors' service contracts contain change of control provisions. 
For the purposes of these provisions, a change of control is deemed to occur if the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company; or if 
50% or more of the voting rights of the Company or the right to appoint or remove the majority of the Board of the Company become vested in 
any individual or body or group of individuals or bodies acting in concert; or if all or substantially all of the business, assets and undertakings of 
the Company become owned by any person, firm or company (other than a subsidiary or associated company). A change of control is also 
deemed to occur if the whole of the issued capital of BG Energy Holdings Limited or a substantial part of the undertaking of that company 
(including its subsidiaries) is transferred to another company, unless that transferee company is a subsidiary of the Company, or a company 
ultimately owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the ultimate owners of the Company.

Change of control continued 
However, a change of control does not occur if (and only if) through a process of reconstruction the Company becomes a subsidiary of another 
company owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the shareholders of the Company. The Executive Directors' service contracts 
provide that any payments made pursuant to these provisions will be made less any deductions the employer is required to make. Any such 
payments shall be in full and final settlement of any claims the Executive Director may have against the employer or any associated company 
arising out of the termination of employment except for any personal injury claim, any claim in respect of accrued pension rights or statutory 
employment protection claims.

(b) William Friedrich holds 77 740 ordinary shares in the form of 15 548 American Depositary Shares (ADSs). Each ADS represents five ordinary shares.  
(c) Paul Collins' holding is in the form of 20 000 ADSs. 
On 12 February 2007, William Friedrich sold 250 000 ordinary shares in the Company. Other than this, there have been no changes in the 
interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings between 1 January and 3 April 2007. 
As of 3 April 2007, the Directors' interests in the share capital of the Company represent less than 1% of the issued share capital of  
the Company. 
PENSIONS 
The basis on which retirement benefits are calculated for Frank Chapman, William Friedrich and Ashley Almanza has not changed during the 
year. They receive an accrual of benefits designed to target a pension of two-thirds of their final 12 months' salary on retirement from BG Group 
at age 60, inclusive of retained benefits. As is the case for all other UK employees who became pension scheme members before 6 April 2006, 
they cannot be paid an immediate pension before age 60 on a non-actuarially reduced basis unless they have attained age 55 and completed  
10 years' service with the Group (including pensionable service transferred from previous employment) and the Company expressly agrees to 
payment on an unreduced basis, or they are over the age of 50 and have been made redundant, or in the event of incapacity. UK employees who 
became pension scheme members on or after 6 April 2006 cannot be paid a non-actuarially reduced pension until age 60, other than in the 
event of incapacity. Pensions in payment are increased in line with retail price inflation. An adult dependant's pension is payable on death in 
service, equal to two-thirds of that payable to the pension scheme member based on potential service to age 65. On death in retirement, an 
adult dependant's pension is payable equal to two-thirds of the member's pension prior to exchanging any of it for a cash lump sum. 
All the Executive Directors were members of the BG Pension Scheme (BGPS) and the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme (BGSBS) throughout 
the year. The BGPS is a funded, registered (formerly approved) pension scheme and the BGSBS is an unfunded, unregistered (formerly unapproved) 
pension scheme. The allocation of the Executive Directors' benefits between these schemes changed after 6 April 2006, when a new pensions 
taxation regime came into force. Provision has been made in respect of the additional obligations for unfunded post-retirement benefits. 
Prior to 6 April 2006, the benefits provided for the Executive Directors under the BGPS were subject to the earnings cap, a restriction on the 
amount of pay that could be used to calculate pensions payable from an approved pension scheme. Retirement benefits (including contingent 
death benefits) that were not covered by the BGPS were provided by the BGSBS and a provision was made in respect of the additional 
obligations for these post-retirement benefits. 
With effect from 6 April 2006, and subject to the consent of each member affected, the earnings cap was removed for most purposes in the 
BGPS. We continue to operate the BGSBS, now as a way of providing benefits to those who are above or close to the new  lifetime allowance'. 
As at 5 April 2006, the value of Mr Chapman's accrued BGPS benefits exceeded the lifetime allowance. He therefore ceased to accrue pension  
in the BGPS for service after that date and his remaining past service benefits and pension for future service are provided through the BGSBS.  
As at 5 April 2006, the value of Mr Friedrich's and Mr Almanza's accrued BGPS benefits were both less than the lifetime allowance. They both 
consented to the removal of the earnings cap with the proviso that their resulting BGPS benefits should be limited to the lifetime allowance. 
Their remaining past service benefits and their pensions for future service are provided by the BGSBS. 
In July 2006, the Company made the first of two additional contributions to the BGPS to cover the increase in its liability arising from the 
removal of the earnings cap; the second payment was made in January 2007. There has been a corresponding reduction in the provision in  
the Company's accounts.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

(c) The transfer values shown at the end of 2005 and 2006 represent the value of each Executive Director's accrued pension based on total service completed to the relevant 
date. The accrued pensions are the amounts that would have been paid if the Executive Director had left service at the relevant date. The transfer values are calculated in 
accordance with guidance note GN11 issued by the Institute of Actuaries and Faculty of Actuaries. 
(d) The assumptions used to calculate transfer values were changed with effect from 1 January 2007. These figures have been calculated using the new assumptions. 
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS 
To broaden the experience of Executive Directors, it is Company policy to allow each of them to accept one external appointment as a non-
executive director of another company, the fees for which would be retained by the individual Director. William Friedrich is a non-executive 
director of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc (RBS) and is a member of its audit committee. In this capacity he receives a total annual fee  
of  95 000 which he retains. RBS is one of a number of relationship banks providing a variety of commercial banking and other financial 
services to BG Group.
