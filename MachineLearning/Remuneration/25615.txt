15BDear Shareholder 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors'  
Report on remuneration for 2007 for which we will be seeking 
approval from shareholders at our Annual General Meeting.  
The Remuneration Committee is focused on ensuring the 
remuneration policy enables the Group to attract, retain  
and motivate the executive talent required for the successful 
delivery of our integrated gas strategy. 
During 2007, the Committee reviewed BG Group's approach to 
executive remuneration and the use of share-based incentives 
across the Group, against the international oil and gas market  
in which we compete for talent. The review was prompted by the 
continued evolution of BG Group and the need to compete with 
remuneration practices in new geographical areas and markets,  
at a time when the employment market within the oil and gas 
industry is becoming ever more challenging.  
In order to ensure that BG Group can recruit and retain high  
quality management in a global market for talent, BG Group  
needs to offer arrangements that are competitive with all industry 
participants. Following consultation with our major shareholders, 
the Committee is seeking formal shareholder approval for a new 
Long Term Incentive Plan and has made some amendments to the 
Annual Incentive Scheme for 2008. The Committee is also seeking 
approval to replace our Share Incentive Plan and Sharesave Scheme 
which are reaching the end of their ten year lives.  
The Committee appreciates your support for these changes,  
which we believe are in shareholders' interests.

5BREMUNERATION POLICY 
The central premise of BG Group's remuneration policy is that,  
while reward arrangements should be market competitive, 
employees should look to performance-related incentives rather 
than base salaries to earn above-average reward. Performance-
related incentive schemes form a significant proportion of the  
total reward package for executives and are designed to align  
their interests with those of shareholders and establish a clear  
link between pay and performance. 
In defining BG Group's remuneration policy, the Committee takes 
into account advice received from external consultants and also best 
practice guidelines set by institutional shareholder bodies, including 
the principles and guidelines on executive remuneration issued by 
the Association of British Insurers (ABI).  
To implement the policy, BG Group has a well-developed, Group-
wide performance management system and, during 2007, operated 
three complementary performance-related incentive schemes for 
executives: 
 the Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS) - designed to focus executives 
on the business priorities of the financial year and to reinforce 
the individual and Company performance ethic; 
 the Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS) - aims to motivate 
participants to maximise total shareholder return (TSR)
(c)
F  
as measured against a comparator group of international  
oil and gas companies over a period of three years; and 
 the Company Share Option Scheme (CSOS) - aims to drive real 
earnings growth over the long term. The mechanism used for 
measuring this is the growth in the Group's earnings per share 
(EPS)
(d) 
relative to the growth in the Retail Prices Index, excluding 
mortgage interest repayments (RPIX). 
The three schemes complement each other and enable the 
measurement and reward of both short- and long-term 
performance. The Committee considers that the three year  
vesting period for the LTIS and the CSOS is appropriate.  
                                                                                    
(a) See footnote on page 61.
 
(b)
 
The Ballylumford Power Pension Scheme is a BG Group pension scheme. 
(c) TSR is defined as the return on investment obtained from holding a company's 
shares over a period. It includes dividends paid, the change in the capital value  
of the shares and other payments to, or by, shareholders within the period.  
TSR is calculated on a common currency basis to ensure that international 
comparisons are fair. The Committee believes that TSR is an appropriate 
measure of relative performance. 
(d) EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings for the financial year (on a Business 
Performance measure) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in 
issue and ranking for dividend during the year. The Committee believes that EPS 
provides an appropriate measure of company growth. EPS is published quarterly 
when BG Group reports its results. For grants made on or after 21 July 2004, the 
Group's published EPS is adjusted to take into account the volatility of both 
commodity prices and exchange rates. This adjustment is independently 
reviewed. See page 64 for further details. 
 
1BREVIEW OF REMUNERATION 
During the year, the Committee reviewed the remuneration 
arrangements for Executive Directors and the share-based 
arrangements used more widely throughout the Group. 
Remuneration was benchmarked on a total reward basis (i.e.  
including salaries, incentives and pensions) against the FTSE  
30 (excluding financial services companies) and the international  
oil and gas companies in our current and proposed TSR  
comparator groups.  
As a result of the review, the Committee decided to make and 
propose certain changes to the incentive arrangements for  
2008 in order for BG Group to maintain its competitive position: 
 for 2008, GEC annual incentive awards greater than 100%  
of salary will be deferred into shares that will not be released  
to the individual for a period of three years; 
 for 2008, the maximum annual incentive opportunity for the 
Chief Executive will be increased from 150% to 200% of salary, 
and for the Chief Financial Officer from 125% to 150% of salary. 
Superior levels of performance will be required to achieve  
these new higher incentive levels; 
 shareholder approval is being sought for the new Long Term 
Incentive Plan 2008 (LTIP) to replace the CSOS and the LTIS. In 
2008, LTIP awards to Executive Directors and members of the 
GEC will be made via Performance Share Awards, subject to  
a face value limit of six times salary and an Estimated Present 
Value (EPV) limit of 250% of salary.  All other eligible employees 
will be subject to the EPV limit of 250% of salary and may  
receive Performance Share Awards, Group Share Awards, or  
a combination, at the discretion of the Company. In subsequent 
financial years, Executive Directors and members of the GEC  
may receive Performance Share Awards, Market Value Options  
or a combination of these at the discretion of the Company.  
In addition to the above awards, other eligible employees  
may also receive Group Share Awards or a combination of  
these awards at the discretion of the Company. All awards  
to participants will be subject to an individual EPV limit of 300%  
of salary. Further details are set out on pages 133 to 135; and 
 shareholder approval is also being sought to replace the Share 
Incentive Plan (SIP) and the Sharesave Scheme, which are 
reaching the end of their ten year lives.  
2BCOMPONENTS OF REMUNERATION 
The current remuneration package for Executive Directors 
comprises performance-related and non-performance-related 
components. The performance-related components are the 
incentive schemes referred to above and the non-performance-
related components are base salary, taxable benefits and pension 
entitlements. In addition, the Executive Directors are eligible  
to participate in the Company's all-employee share schemes.  
Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group have  
been taken into account by the Committee in determining the 
remuneration packages for Executive Directors. The Committee  
has also followed the provisions of Schedule A to the Combined 
Code that relate to the design of performance-related remuneration. 
The proportion of each Executive Director's total remuneration  
that is performance-related is significant even for target 
performance. For stretch performance, the proportion of total 
remuneration that is performance-related is higher, as is the  
total amount of remuneration payable. 
The average proportion of remuneration (including pension) that 
was performance-related in 2007 is illustrated by the following 
chart. In estimating the relative importance of those elements  
of remuneration that are, and those that are not, performance-
related as required by the Regulations, a number of assumptions 
have had to be made about the Company's share price growth  
and TSR, relative to the Company's comparator group, over the  
next three years.  BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2007

Base salaries  
Executive Directors' salaries are reviewed each year with any 
changes normally taking effect from 1 April. This review takes  
into account individual performance, experience and market 
competitiveness. Pensionable salary is derived from base  
salary only.  
In line with our remuneration policy, the Committee benchmarks 
Executive Directors' salaries against a comparator group, which,  
for the 2007 salary review, was the FTSE 30 excluding financial 
services companies. Executive Director salaries are between  
the median and upper quartile for this comparator group. The 
Committee believes this positioning is appropriate given the 
significantly higher total reward levels at other international  
oil and gas companies with which BG Group competes for talent.  
12BAnnual Incentive Scheme (AIS) 
The Group operates a cash-based annual incentive scheme,  
which in 2007 provided an incentive opportunity in the range  
of 0% to 150% of base salary (0% to 200% for 2008). 
At the start of the incentive year (1 January), the Board sets 
challenging budget and stretch financial performance targets  
and the Committee endorses other performance measures,  
notably with respect to health, safety and environmental  
indicators. Bonuses at the higher end of the range are payable  
only for demonstrably superior Group and individual performance.  
For the Executive Directors, the performance measures for the  
2007 incentive year were EPS
(a)
, return on average capital employed
(b)
 
(ROACE) and performance against a Health, Safety and Environment 
(HSE) balanced scorecard
(c)
. The weighting of each of these metrics  
is illustrated on the next chart: 
                                                                                    
(a) Actual results are adjusted to exclude the volatility of upstream prices,  
the US$/UK  exchange rate, the volatility of natural gas prices on contracted 
LNG cargoes and the Comgas regulatory current account.  
(b) Average capital employed consists of total equity excluding commodity financial 
instruments (including associated deferred tax) and net funds/borrowings, 
averaged between the start and the end of the year. Average capital employed is 
adjusted to exclude the volatility of upstream prices and the US$/UK  exchange 
rate. Return on average capital employed represents Business Performance  
profit after tax excluding net finance income/costs on net funds/borrowings, 
adjusted as in (a), as a percentage of average capital employed. 
(c) The HSE balanced scorecard measures performance across a range of leading and 
lagging indicators reflecting the Group's commitment to HSE, and is designed to 
ensure that HSE performance is explicitly considered within the incentive framework.  
 The adjustments in (a) and (b) are independently reviewed.

In determining the actual incentive payment, the Committee 
considers these results against the context of the overall 
performance of the business and of the individual. The  
review of the overall performance of the business takes into 
consideration such factors as operational performance, strategy  
and business development activities and performance against 
industry peers. The review of individual performance takes  
into consideration achievements against the individual's personal 
performance contract.  
For the 2007 incentive year, financial performance against both the 
EPS and ROACE targets and performance against the HSE balanced 
scorecard were rated as stretch. Taking into account these results 
and overall business and individual performance, the Committee 
has awarded the Chief Executive an AIS payment of 140% of base 
salary, the former Deputy Chief Executive an AIS payment of 100%  
of base salary and the Chief Financial Officer an AIS payment of 110% 
of base salary. Payments in respect of the 2007 incentive year were 
made in March 2008. 
13BLong-term incentives  
The narrative below relates to the current schemes that operated 
during the 2007 financial year. As noted above, approval is being 
sought for the introduction of a new LTIP, which will replace these 
schemes. Further details of the LTIP can be found on pages 133 to 135. 
When making the decision on the level of award, the Committee 
takes into consideration a number of factors including face value, 
EPV and scheme dilution limits. 
The face value of an award is equal to the number of shares, or 
shares under option, multiplied by the relevant share price. The 
relevant share price of an LTIS award is the average share price  
for the 12 months immediately prior to the date of award. The 
relevant share price for a CSOS award is the average share price  
for the three dealing days immediately prior to the date of grant.  
The rules of the LTIS and CSOS each permit a maximum award with 
a face value equal to 400% of salary in each year. The maximum 
combined award granted during 2007 was 400% of salary in LTIS 
and 400% of salary in CSOS.  
EPV is a measure that describes the economic or fair value of an 
award. The measure takes account of the performance conditions 
and the risk that grants and allocations may be forfeited.  
EPV is calculated independently by Kepler Associates.

19BLong Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS)  
A limited number of key employees are allocated Company shares  
under the LTIS. This allocation marks the beginning of a three year 
performance period. The Company's TSR performance against that  
of a comparator group of companies over the three year period will 
determine what proportion of the allocated shares will be transferred 
into the ownership of the employee. There is no retest provision.  
In the event of a change of control, vesting of shares under the LTIS 
is not automatic and would depend upon the extent to which the 
performance conditions had been met at the time. Time pro-rating 
will apply if the Remuneration Committee determines that this  
is appropriate given the circumstances of the change of control. 
For the 2004 allocation, the comparator group comprised  
21 companies, including BG Group plc.  The Committee considered 
that this group represented an appropriate set of international oil 
and gas companies against which the performance of BG Group 
could be compared by shareholders. 
For the 2005 allocation, the group was reduced to 19, due to the 
merger of Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. and Shell Transport and 
Trading Co. plc to form Royal Dutch Shell plc and the acquisition  
of Unocal Corporation by Chevron Texaco Corporation (now called 
Chevron Corporation). 
For the 2006 allocation, the group was reduced to 17, due to the 
acquisition of Burlington Resources Inc. by ConocoPhillips and  
the acquisition of Kerr-McGee Corporation by Anadarko  
Petroleum Corporation.  
For the 2007 allocation, the group was reduced further  
to 16, due to the merger of Statoil ASA and Norsk Hydro  
ASA's petroleum activities. 
The other companies in the comparator group are currently  
as follows: 
  Anadarko Petroleum 
Corporation 
  BP plc 
  Chevron  
Corporation 
  ConocoPhillips 
  Duke Energy 
Corporation 
  El Paso  
Corporation  
  ENI S.p.A.  
  Exxon Mobil 
Corporation 
  Hess Corporation 
  Marathon Oil 
Corporation 
  Occidental Petroleum 
Corporation  
  Repsol YPF S.A.  
  Royal Dutch Shell plc 
  StatoilHydro ASA 
(formerly Statoil ASA 
and Norsk Hydro ASA)  
  Total S.A. 
Of these companies, nine are headquartered in the USA, one in  
the UK and five elsewhere in Europe. 
The Committee reviews this comparator group prior to making  
any award under the LTIS. 
The Committee has set the following performance conditions  
for allocations made under the LTIS: 
BG Group's TSR position  
in comparator group % of allocated shares transferred 
Top 100 
Upper quartile 75 
Median 30 
Below median All allocated shares are forfeited 
Where performance is between upper quartile (UQ) and top  
(T) or between median (M) and UQ, the percentage of shares  
to be transferred is determined on a proportionate basis.  
These performance conditions are illustrated by the graph below: 
 
20BLTIS performance conditions 
% of allocated shares transferred 
30

T UQ M
 
The performance period for the 2004 allocation ended on  
2 September 2007. BG Group's final TSR for this period relative  
to the TSRs of companies in the relevant comparator group was 
measured by the independent TSR monitoring service of Alithos 
Limited and reviewed by Kepler Associates. This analysis placed  
BG Group in sixth position. The Committee therefore decided,  
in accordance with the performance condition for the 2004 
allocation, that 75% of the original allocation of shares had vested 
and, accordingly, these shares were transferred to the participating 
employees on 6 September 2007.  
14BCompany Share Option Scheme (CSOS) 
Approximately 2 800 employees are currently eligible to participate 
in the CSOS, including all UK payroll employees and those overseas 
employees above a certain grade.  
The Company grants an option over its shares to each eligible 
employee and the option price is set at the fair market value  
at the time of the grant. As described below, the CSOS measures 
performance according to EPS growth relative to the growth in the 
RPIX. The Committee considers that an EPS performance measure 
ensures that employees receive rewards only when the Company 
has achieved sustained earnings growth during the performance 
period. The calculation of EPS growth for grants made on or after  
21 July 2004 has been made using constant commodity prices  
and constant exchange rates.  
During the transition to the International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS), EPS growth figures are being calculated on  
a consistent basis by restating prior years' results in compliance  
with IFRS.  
To the extent that the performance target has been met three years 
from the date of grant, the option may be exercised (in whole or in 
part) at any time up to the expiry of ten years from the date of grant. 
There is no retest provision.  
As in prior years, the levels of grant made to individual employees in 
2007 were differentiated based on each individual's performance  
to date and expectation of future contributions. For the 2007 grant,  
the Committee set the following performance targets: 
% EPS growth over RPIX (over 3 years) % of options that are exercisable 
30 or greater 100 
15 50 
Less than 15 Options are forfeited 
A proportion of between half and all of the options will  
be exercisable if the Company achieves EPS growth over  
three years of RPIX plus between 15% and 30%, respectively.  BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2007
DIRECTORS' REPORT
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
 
 
65
These targets are the same as those that apply to the 2005 and  
2006 grants (and applied to the 2004 grant) and are considered  
by the Committee to be particularly demanding.  
These performance targets are illustrated by the graph below: 
21BCSOS performance conditions 
% of options exercisable 
% EPS growth over three years in excess of RPIX
50
100
30% 15%
 
Over the three year performance period for the 2004 CSOS grant, 
the Company's EPS growth above the growth in the RPIX exceeded 
30%. As a result, 100% of the shares under the option granted  
to employees in September 2004 are exercisable prior to  
September 2014.  
In the event of a change of control, exercise of an option under  
the CSOS is not automatic and would depend upon the extent to 
which the performance condition had been satisfied at the time.  
22BAll-employee share schemes 
In order to encourage share ownership, the Company currently 
provides two all-employee share schemes for its UK employees,  
the Share Incentive Plan and the Sharesave Scheme. 
23BShare Incentive Plan (SIP)  
The BG Group SIP is approved by HM Revenue & Customs. There  
are two parts to the SIP - the Partnership Shares Plan and the  
Free Shares Plan. 
24B(a) Partnership Shares 
Eligible employees are offered the opportunity to buy Company 
shares from pre-tax earnings as part of a regular share purchase 
plan. Shares are currently purchased every six months using 
employees' accumulated deductions and are placed in trust.  
At 31 December 2007, 63.6% of eligible employees were participating  
in this plan. Of those participating, 75% were contributing the 
maximum of  125 per month. 
25B(b) Free Shares 
A Free Shares award of a maximum of 410 shares, representing the 
value of the  3 000 statutory limit, was made on 25 April 2007 to  
all eligible employees in the UK, based on the Group's performance 
during 2006. These shares will be held in trust for up to five years.  
For 2008, the Committee may approve the award of Free Shares  
in the Company up to the statutory limit for each individual.  
This number will be determined based on the Group's  
performance during 2007. 
26BSharesave Scheme 
The Company continued to operate the BG Group Sharesave 
Scheme in 2007. The scheme is approved by HM Revenue  
& Customs and enables eligible employees to acquire the 
Company's shares with the proceeds of a monthly savings contract. 
The contract period is three years. At 31 December 2007, 74.4%  
of eligible employees were participating in the Sharesave Scheme, 
contributing an average monthly payment of  221.22. Of those 
participating, 75.3% were contributing the statutory maximum  
of  250 per month. 
6BPENSIONS 
The pension arrangements for Executive Directors are  
detailed on page 70. 
As detailed in note 29, page 115, BG Group operates a number  
of pension plans across the Group. Outside the UK, these plans are 
generally defined contribution (or money purchase) arrangements. 
In April 2007, a defined contribution plan was introduced in the UK 
for new hires. Employees who were already members of the defined 
benefit scheme continue to accrue benefits in that scheme. 
3BDILUTION 
The ABI has published guidelines relating to the disclosure of 
commitments to issue new shares or re-issue Treasury shares under 
a company's share-based schemes. In the event of all options and 
awards outstanding as at 31 December 2007 under BG Group's  
CSOS (under which options are currently satisfied by the issue of 
new shares) and LTIS (under which awards are currently satisfied  
by the re-issue of Treasury shares) becoming exercisable/vesting 
respectively, the resulting issue of new shares and re-issue  
of Treasury shares would amount to 2.03% of the issued share  
capital at that date. 
In the event of all options outstanding as at 31 December 2007 
under BG Group's Sharesave Scheme (which involves the issue  
of new shares) becoming exercisable, the resulting issue would 
represent 0.07% of the issued ordinary share capital at that date. 
Partnership and Free Share awards made under the SIP during  
2007 were satisfied by the re-issue of Treasury shares. These  
awards represented 0.002% of the issued share capital as at  
31 December 2007. 
The Company's intention is to continue to satisfy the future exercise 
of options and vesting awards under the above schemes by the issue 
of new shares and re-issue of Treasury shares as described above. 
4BSHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES 
The Committee has adopted guidelines for Executive Directors,  
GEC members and certain other senior employees to encourage 
substantial long-term share ownership. These require that, over a 
period of five years from the introduction of the guidelines in 2002 
(or date of appointment, if later), Executive Directors build up, and 
then retain, a holding of shares with a value equivalent to 200% of 
base salary. The required holding for other members of the GEC is 
100% of base salary and for certain other senior employees is 50% of 
base salary. The guidelines require that, in relation to the 2002 and 
later LTIS allocations, vested shares (net of tax) should be retained 
by the individual until the required shareholding level is reached. 
7BSERVICE CONTRACTS 
The Executive Directors' service contracts, including arrangements 
for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee and 
are designed to recruit, retain and motivate Directors of the quality 
required to manage the Company. The Committee considers that  
a rolling contract with a notice period of one year is appropriate.  
In line with the Company's policy, the Executive Directors' service 
contracts contain change of control provisions. Should the Directors' 
employment be terminated within 12 months of a change of control, 
they are entitled to liquidated damages. The amount of liquidated 
damages is equal to one year's gross salary and a credit of one year's 
pensionable service (less any deductions the employer is required to 
make), which the Committee considers to be a genuine pre-estimate 
of loss. The Committee considers that these provisions assist with 
recruitment and retention and that their inclusion is therefore in  
the best interests of shareholders.  www.bg-group.com

Other than change of control, the Executive Directors' service 
contracts do not contain provisions for compensation in the  
event of early termination. When calculating termination payments,  
the Committee takes into account a variety of factors, including 
individual and Company performance, the obligation for the 
Director to mitigate his or her own loss (for example, by gaining new 
employment) and the Director's length of service. Further details of 
the Executive Directors' service contracts can be found on page 67. 
8BSENIOR EXECUTIVES BELOW THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
The policy and practice with regard to the remuneration of senior 
employees below the Executive Directors is entirely consistent with 
that for the Executive Directors. These senior executives all have  
a significant portion of their reward package linked to performance. 
They all qualify for AIS, CSOS and LTIS, and their financial targets  
are the same as, or cascaded from, the targets for the Executive 
Directors. The Committee reviews and approves the individual 
remuneration packages for the GEC members and the Company 
Secretary in accordance with the overriding objectives of our 
remuneration policy. Their individual performance is reviewed  
and their increases in base salary, AIS payments, and CSOS and LTIS 
awards are subject to approval by the Committee each year. Under 
the proposed new LTIP, senior employees will continue to be treated 
consistently with the Executive Directors and members of the GEC, 
with the exception that a portion of the LTIP may additionally  
be made other than in Performance Shares, but still subject  
to the overall plan limits.  
9BNON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
The Board aims to recruit non-executive Directors of a high  
calibre, with broad commercial, international or other relevant  
experience. Non-executive Directors are appointed by the Board  
on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee. Their 
appointment is for an initial term of three years, subject to election 
by shareholders at the first AGM following their appointment.  
Upon the recommendation of the Nominations Committee, they  
are generally re-appointed for a second term of three years,  
subject to re-election by shareholders. There is no notice period  
and no provision for termination payments.  
The terms of engagement of the non-executive Directors are  
set out in a letter of appointment. 
The basic annual fee paid to non-executive Directors is  65 000. 
Additional fees are also payable, for example, for membership  
of, or chairing, a committee of the Board or acting as Senior 
Independent Director. Fees are reviewed every two years, taking  
into account time commitment, competition for high quality non-
executive directors and market movements. The next review will  
be effective 1 July 2008. 
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the 
Company's share schemes, incentive schemes or pension schemes. 
10BCHAIRMAN 
Sir Robert Wilson was initially appointed as Chairman with  
effect from 1 January 2004 and was re-appointed with effect  
from 1 January 2007. In line with the non-executive Directors,  
Sir Robert's re-appointment is for a three year term and there  
is no notice period and no provision for payment in the event of 
early termination. The fee paid to Sir Robert Wilson is  625 000 per 
annum, which is next subject to review effective 1 January 2009.

(b) William Friedrich retired as a Director on 13 December 2007. 
Change of control 
As described on page 65, the Executive Directors' service contracts contain change of control provisions. 
For the purposes of these provisions, a change of control is deemed to occur if the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company;  
or if 50% or more of the voting rights of the Company or the right to appoint or remove the majority of the Board of the Company become 
vested in any individual or body or group of individuals or bodies acting in concert; or if all or substantially all of the business, assets and 
undertakings of the Company become owned by any person, firm or company (other than a subsidiary or associated company). A change  
of control is also deemed to occur if the whole of the issued capital of BG Energy Holdings Limited or a substantial part of the undertaking  
of that company (including its subsidiaries) is transferred to another company, unless that transferee company is a subsidiary of the  
Company, or a company ultimately owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the ultimate owners of the Company.   www.bg-group.com

Change of Control continued 
However, a change of control does not occur if (and only if) through a process of reconstruction the Company becomes a subsidiary of another 
company owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the shareholders of the Company. The Executive Directors' service contracts 
provide that any payments made pursuant to these provisions will be made, less any deductions the employer is required to make. Any such 
payments shall be in full and final settlement of any claims the Executive Director may have against the employer or any associated company 
arising out of the termination of employment, except for any personal injury claim, any claim in respect of accrued pension rights, or statutory 
employment protection claims.

(c)  Or on date of retirement if earlier. 
(d) William Friedrich stepped down from the Board and Board Committees on 13 December 2007 but remains an employee of the Group. At that date, he held 77 740 ordinary 
shares in the form of 15 548 American Depositary Shares (ADSs). Each ADS represents five ordinary shares. 
(e) Paul Collins' holding is in the form of 20 000 ADSs. 
There have been no changes in the interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings between  
1 January 2008 and 12 March 2008. 
As of 12 March 2008, the Directors' interests in the share capital of the Company represent less than 1% of the issued share capital of the Company. 
PENSIONS  
The basis on which retirement benefits are calculated for Frank Chapman, William Friedrich and Ashley Almanza has not changed during the 
year. They receive an accrual of benefits designed to target a pension of two-thirds of their final 12 months' salary on retirement from BG Group 
at age 60, inclusive of retained benefits. As is the case for all other UK employees who became pension scheme members before 6 April 2006, 
they cannot be paid an immediate pension before age 60 on a non-actuarially reduced basis unless they have attained age 55 and completed 
ten years' service with the Group (including pensionable service transferred from previous employment) and the Company expressly agrees  
to payment on an unreduced basis, or they are over the age of 50 and have been made redundant, or in the event of incapacity. UK employees 
who became pension scheme members on or after 6 April 2006 cannot be paid a non-actuarially reduced pension until age 60, other than in 
the event of incapacity. Pensions in payment are increased in line with retail price inflation. An adult dependant's pension is payable on death 
in service, equal to two-thirds of that payable to the pension scheme member based on potential service to age 65. On death in retirement, an 
adult dependant's pension is payable equal to two-thirds of the member's pension prior to exchanging any of it for a cash lump sum. 
All the Executive Directors were members of the BG Pension Scheme (BGPS) and the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme (BGSBS) throughout 
the year. The BGPS is a funded, registered pension scheme and the BGSBS is an unfunded, unregistered pension scheme. The allocation of the 
Executive Directors' benefits between the registered and unregistered schemes changed after 6 April 2006, when a new pensions taxation 
regime came into force. Their BGPS benefits are limited to the lifetime allowance  and the balance of their benefits is provided by the BGSBS. 
Frank Chapman elected enhanced protection  under the new regime and therefore has a personal lifetime allowance that is based on the 
value of his accrued BGPS benefits at 6 April 2006. 
A provision has been made in the Company's accounts in respect of the obligations for unfunded post-retirement benefits. 
As part of the changes made in response to the new pensions taxation regime, the earnings cap  was removed in 2006 as a limit on  
BGPS benefits for all members including the Executive Directors. The Company made two additional contributions to the BGPS to cover  
the consequential increase in BGPS liability and the second of these payments was made in January 2007. There has been a corresponding

EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS 
To broaden the experience of Executive Directors, it is Company policy to allow each of them to accept one external appointment as a  
non-executive director of another company, the fees for which would be retained by the individual Director. William Friedrich is a non-executive 
director of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc (RBS) and is a member of its audit committee. In this capacity he receives a total annual fee  
of  100 000, which he retains. RBS is one of a number of relationship banks providing a variety of commercial banking and other financial 
services to BG Group.
