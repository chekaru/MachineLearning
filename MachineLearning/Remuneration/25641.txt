Directors' Report - Corporate Governance
Remuneration report 
54 
 
Dear Shareholder 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors' Report  
on remuneration for 2008 for which we will be seeking approval from 
shareholders at our Annual General Meeting.  
The Remuneration Committee is focused on ensuring the remuneration 
policy enables the Group to attract, retain and motivate the executive 
talent required for the successful delivery of our integrated gas strategy. 
At our May 2008 General Meeting shareholders formally approved and 
adopted the BG Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan 2008 (the Long 
Term Incentive Plan or LTIP). The BG Group plc Sharesave Plan 2008  
(the Sharesave Plan) and the BG Group plc Share Incentive Plan 2008 
(the Share Incentive Plan 2008) were also approved and adopted. 
As noted in our 2007 Remuneration report some amendments to  
our Annual Incentive Scheme were also made which took effect for  
the 2008 financial year.  
Changes to both our annual and long-term incentives were prompted  
by BG Group's continued evolution and need to compete for talent in  
an ever more challenging gas and oil employment market. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank shareholders for their 
continued support. 
Baroness Hogg 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

REMUNERATION POLICY 
The central premise of BG Group's remuneration policy is that while 
total reward should be market competitive, the majority should be 
delivered through performance-related incentives. Performance-related 
incentive schemes are designed to align the interests of executives  
with those of shareholders and establish a clear link between pay  
and performance. 
In defining BG Group's remuneration policy, the Committee takes  
into account advice received from external consultants and also best 
practice guidelines set by institutional shareholder bodies, including  
the principles and guidelines on executive remuneration issued by  
the Association of British Insurers (ABI).  
To implement the policy, BG Group has a well-developed, Group-wide 
performance management system and, during 2008, operated  
two complementary performance-related incentive arrangements  
for executives: 
  the Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS) - designed to focus executives  
on the business priorities of the financial year and to reinforce the 
individual and Company performance ethic; and 
  the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) - the LTIP is designed to reward 
and retain executives over the longer term whilst also aligning their 
interests with those of BG Group shareholders. The LTIP allows for 
various types of awards to be made (specifically Group Share Awards, 
Performance Share Awards and Market Value Options). Executive 
Directors and members of the GEC may only be awarded 
Performance Share Awards and Market Value Options. On the  
initial operation of the LTIP in September 2008 Executive Directors 
and members of the GEC only received grants of Performance Share 
Awards. Performance Share Awards aim to motivate participants  
to maximise total shareholder return (TSR)
(c)
 as measured against 
a weighted index comprising a selection of sector comparators  
over a period of three years.  
The two incentive arrangements complement each other and enable the 
measurement and reward of both short and long-term performance. 
The Committee considers that the three year vesting period for the  
LTIP is appropriate.  
COMPONENTS OF REMUNERATION 
The current remuneration package for Executive Directors comprises 
fixed and variable components. The variable components are the 
                                                                                    
(a) See footnote on page 54. 
(b) The Ballylumford Power Pension Scheme is a BG Group pension scheme. 
(c) TSR is defined as the return on investment obtained from holding a company's shares 
over a period. It includes dividends paid, the change in the capital value of the shares 
and other payments to or by shareholders within the period. TSR is calculated on  
a common currency basis to ensure that international comparisons are fair. The 
Committee believes that TSR relative to a peer group is an appropriate measure  
of relative performance. 
incentive arrangements referred to above and the fixed components  
are base salary, taxable benefits and pension entitlements. In addition, 
the Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Company's  
all-employee share plans. Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in 
the Group have been taken into account by the Committee in determining 
the remuneration packages for Executive Directors. The Committee has 
also followed the provisions of Schedule A to the Combined Code that 
relate to the design of performance-related remuneration. 
The proportion of each Executive Director's total remuneration that is 
performance-related is significant even for target performance. For stretch 
performance, the proportion of total remuneration that is performance-
related is higher, as is the total amount of remuneration payable. 
The average proportion of remuneration (including pension) that was 
performance-related in 2008 is illustrated by the following chart. In 
estimating the relative importance of those elements of remuneration 
that are, and those that are not, performance-related as required by the 
Regulations, a number of assumptions have had to be made about the 
Company's share price growth and TSR relative to the weighted index, 
over the next three years.

Base salaries  
Executive Directors' salaries are reviewed each year with any changes 
normally taking effect from 1 April. This review takes into account 
individual performance, experience and market competitiveness. 
Pensionable salary is derived from base salary only.  
In line with BG Group's remuneration policy, the Committee 
benchmarks Executive Directors' salaries against a comparator group, 
which, for the 2008 salary review, was the FTSE 30 excluding financial 
services companies. Executive Director salaries are between the median 
and upper quartile for this comparator group. The Committee believes 
this positioning is appropriate given the significantly higher total reward 
levels at other international oil and gas companies with which BG Group 
competes for talent. 
Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS) 
In 2008, the AIS provided an incentive opportunity in the range of 0%  
to 200% of base salary. The maximum annual incentive opportunity  
for the Chief Executive was 200% of salary and for the Chief Financial 
Officer was 150% of salary. All GEC AIS awards up to 100% of salary are 
paid in cash and any excess over 100% is deferred into shares that are 
not released to the individual for a period of three years.  www.bg-group.com
Directors' Report - Corporate Governance
Remuneration report continued

At the start of the incentive year (1 January), the Board sets challenging 
budget and stretch financial performance targets and the Committee 
endorses other performance measures, notably with respect to health, 
safety and environmental indicators. Bonuses at the higher end of  
the range are payable only for demonstrably superior Group and 
individual performance.  
For the Executive Directors, the performance measures for the 2008 
incentive year were EPS
(a)
, return on average capital employed
(b)
 (ROACE), 
performance against a health, safety and environment (HSE) balanced 
scorecard
(c)
 and achievements against the individual's personal 
scorecard. The Committee feels that these are the appropriate  
measures to assess the performance of the Company. 
In determining the actual incentive payment, the Committee follows a 
three-stage process. Firstly, performance against the financial and HSE 
targets is assessed. Secondly, these results are reviewed in the context  
of the underlying performance of the business taking into consideration 
such factors as operational performance, strategy and business 
development activities, and performance against industry peers.  
Thirdly, the Committee considers the performance of the individual 
against their personal scorecard.

For the 2008 incentive year, financial performance against both the  
EPS and ROACE targets was rated above stretch. Performance against 
the HSE balanced scorecard was rated as between target and stretch. 
Taking into account these results and overall business and individual 
performance, the Committee has awarded the Chief Executive an AIS 
                                                                                    
(a) Actual results are adjusted to exclude the volatility of upstream prices, the US$/UK  
exchange rate, the volatility of natural gas prices on contracted LNG cargoes and the 
Comg s regulatory current account.  
(b) Average capital employed consists of total equity excluding commodity financial 
instruments (including associated deferred tax) and net borrowings/funds, averaged 
between the start and the end of the year. Average capital employed is adjusted to 
exclude the volatility of upstream prices and the US$/UK  exchange rate. Return on 
average capital employed represents Business Performance  profit after tax excluding 
net finance income/costs on net borrowings/funds, adjusted as in (a), as a percentage 
of average capital employed. 
(c) The HSE balanced scorecard measures performance across a range of leading and 
lagging indicators reflecting the Group's commitment to HSE, and is designed to 
ensure that HSE performance is explicitly considered within the incentive framework.  
 The adjustments in (a) and (b) are independently reviewed.

award of 180% of base salary and the Chief Financial Officer an AIS 
award of 135% of base salary. In each case, cash payments equating to 
100% of base salary will be made in March 2009; the remainder being 
made in the form of a deferred share award which will normally vest  
in March 2012 and which is subject to forfeiture in the event of leaving 
employment (other than for reason of ill health, agreed retirement  
or redundancy).  
Long-term incentives  
The narrative below relates to the plans that operated during the 2008 
financial year.  
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)  
The LTIP was approved and adopted by shareholders at the May 2008 
General Meeting. It is designed to reward and retain executives over  
the longer term whilst also aligning their interests with those of  
BG Group shareholders. 
The LTIP allows for various types of awards to be made, namely, Group 
Share Awards, Performance Share Awards and Market Value Options. 
When making the decision on the level of award, the Committee takes 
into consideration a number of factors including face value, Estimated 
Present Value (EPV) and plan dilution limits. 
The face value of an award is equal to the number of shares, or shares 
under option, multiplied by the relevant share price. For conditional 
awards made under the LTIP in 2008 the relevant share price of an LTIP 
award is the average share price for the five dealing days immediately 
prior to the date of award. A face value limit of six times salary applies  
to each award, subject to the aggregate of all awards not exceeding  
the EPV limit described below. 
EPV is a measure that describes the economic or fair value of an  
award. The measure takes account of the performance conditions and 
the risk that grants and allocations may be forfeited. EPV is calculated 
independently by Kepler Associates. The overriding EPV limit which 
applied to awards made under the LTIP in 2008 was 250% of salary.  
As previously communicated to shareholders this will increase to  
300% of salary in subsequent financial years.  
Performance Share Awards 
In 2008, Executive Directors and members of the GEC were only 
awarded Performance Share Awards. A limited number of other  
key employees also received Performance Share Awards. 
Performance Share Awards will normally vest three years after the  
date of grant. The vesting is conditional on: 
  continued employment;  
  the individual employee's performance not having fallen significantly 
below that expected since the date of grant; and 
  the Company's TSR performance over a three year performance 
period. This is discussed further below. 
There is a further overriding condition that the Committee must be 
satisfied that the underlying performance of the Company justifies  
the level of vesting. 
TSR performance for the September 2008 Performance Share Awards  
is measured over a three year performance period commencing on  
1 September 2008. The level of Performance Share Awards vesting is 
related to the Company's TSR performance over this period relative  
to a weighted index of a selection of industry peers.  BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2008

If BG Group's TSR performance is less than the Index TSR performance 
over the performance period the Performance Share Award will lapse. 
If BG Group's TSR performance meets the Index TSR performance over 
the performance period 25% of the Performance Share Award will vest. 
If BG Group's TSR performance exceeds the Index TSR performance  
over the performance period by 7% p.a. then 100% of the Performance 
Share Award will vest. 
Between these two points the percentage vesting will be on a linear 
sliding scale basis. 
The TSR outperformance calculation is multiplicative, that is, if the Index 
grows from 100% to 110%, then BG Group is required to move from 100%  
to 134.75% (i.e. 110% x 107%
3
) over three years to achieve maximum vesting. 
In the event of a change of control, vesting of Performance Share  
Awards under the LTIP is not automatic and would depend on the 
extent to which performance conditions had been met at that time. 
Time pro-rating will apply if the Committee considers it appropriate 
given the circumstances of the change of control.  
Group Share Awards 
An award of Group Share Awards was made in September 2008 to 
certain employees below GEC level. Eligibility to be considered for an 
award varies by jurisdiction. Group Share Awards will normally vest  
three years after the date of grant subject to: 
  continued employment; and 
  the individual employee's performance not having fallen significantly 
below that expected since the date of grant.  
In the event of a change of control, the level of vesting of Group  
Share Awards under the LTIP may be subject to time pro-rating if  
the Committee considers it appropriate given the circumstances  
of the change of control.  
Prior to 2008, employees participated in the Long Term Incentive 
Scheme (LTIS) and Company Share Option Scheme (CSOS). No  
further awards will be made under these plans.  
Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS) 
Vesting of LTIS awards is conditional on the Company's TSR performance 
relative to a comparator group of industry peers over a three year period 
which runs from the date of grant. The proportion of the LTIS award 
which vests is dependent on BG Group's position in this comparator 
group. There is no retest provision.  
In the event of a change of control, vesting of shares under the LTIS  
is not automatic and would depend upon the extent to which the 
performance conditions had been met at that time. Time pro-rating  
will apply if the Committee considers that this is appropriate given  
the circumstances of the change of control. 
The following performance conditions apply for awards made under  
the LTIS: 
BG Group's TSR position in comparator group % of allocated shares transferred 
Top 100 
Upper quartile 75 
Median 30 
Below median All allocated shares are forfeited 
Where performance is between upper quartile (UQ) and top (T) or 
between median (M) and UQ, the percentage of shares to be transferred 
is determined on a proportionate basis.  
The performance period for the 2005 allocation ended on 1 September 
2008. BG Group's final TSR for this period relative to the TSRs of 
companies in the relevant comparator group was measured by the 
independent TSR monitoring service of Alithos Limited and reviewed  
by Kepler Associates. This analysis placed BG Group in first position.  
The Committee therefore decided, in accordance with the performance 
condition for the 2005 allocation, that 100% of the original award of 
shares had vested and, accordingly, these shares were transferred to  
the participating employees on 3 September 2008.  
For the 2005 allocation, the comparator group comprised BG Group  
and the following 18 companies: 
Amerada Hess Corporation, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, BP plc, 
Burlington Resources Inc., Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Duke 
Energy Corporation, El Paso Corporation, ENI S.p.A., Exxon Mobil 
Corporation, Kerr-McGee Corporation, Marathon Oil Corporation, Norsk 
Hydro ASA, Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell plc, 
Repsol YPF S.A., Statoil ASA, Total S.A.. 
For the 2006 allocation, the group was reduced to 17, due to the acquisition 
of Burlington-Resources Inc. by ConocoPhillips and the acquisition of  
Kerr-McGee Corporation by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation.  
For the 2007 allocation, the group was reduced further to 16, due to  
the merger of Statoil ASA and Norsk Hydro ASA's petroleum activities.  www.bg-group.com

Company Share Option Scheme (CSOS) 
The option price is based on the market value at the date of grant. 
Options may only be exercised three years from the date of grant  
subject to both continued employment and achievement of a financial 
performance condition. This performance condition determines if and 
the extent to which options may be exercised. It is based on BG Group's 
earnings per share (EPS)
(a)
 growth relative to the growth in the RPIX  
over a period of three financial years relative to the financial year which 
ended immediately prior to the date of grant. The Committee considers 
that an EPS performance measure ensures that employees receive 
rewards only when the Company has achieved sustained earnings 
growth during the performance period. The calculation of EPS growth 
for grants made on or after 21 July 2004 has been made using constant 
commodity prices and constant exchange rates. There is no retest 
provision. Subject to the above conditions the option may be exercised 
(in whole or in part) at any time up to the expiry of ten years from  
the date of grant. 
As a result of the transition to International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS), EPS growth figures are calculated on a consistent  
basis by restating prior years' results in compliance with IFRS. 
% EPS growth over RPIX (over 3 years) % of options that are exercisable 
30 or greater 100 
15 50 
Less than 15 Options are forfeited 
A proportion of between half and all of the options will be exercisable  
if the Company achieves EPS growth over three years of RPIX plus 
between 15% and 30%, respectively. 
Over the three year performance period for the 2005 CSOS grant, the 
Company's EPS growth above the growth in the RPIX exceeded 30%. As  
a result, 100% of the shares under the option granted to employees in 
September 2005 are exercisable prior to September 2015.  
In the event of a change of control, exercise of an option under the CSOS 
is not automatic and would depend upon the extent to which the 
performance condition had been satisfied at the time.  
All-employee share plans 
In order to encourage share ownership, the Company currently provides 
two all-employee UK HM Revenue & Customs approved share plans for 
its UK employees. At the May 2008 General Meeting the Share Incentive 
Plan 2008 and the Sharesave Plan 2008 were adopted and approved. 
These replaced the previous Share Incentive Plan and Sharesave Scheme 
respectively. The first invitation under the Sharesave Plan 2008 was 
made in November 2008. 
Share Incentive Plan (SIP) 
The SIP is approved by HM Revenue & Customs. Two elements of the  
SIP operated during 2008 - the Partnership Shares Plan and the Free 
Shares Plan. 
(a) Partnership Shares 
Eligible employees are offered the opportunity to buy Company shares 
from pre-tax earnings as part of a regular share purchase plan. Shares 
are currently purchased every six months using employees' accumulated 
deductions and are placed in trust.  
                                                                                    
(a)  For a definition of EPS, refer to page 4. 
At 31 December 2008, 70.5% (31 December 2007 63.6%) of eligible 
employees were participating in this plan. Of those participating,  
80% (31 December 2007 75%) were contributing the maximum of  
 125 per month. 
(b) Free Shares 
A Free Shares award of a maximum of 234 shares, representing the 
maximum value allowed within the  3 000 statutory limit, was made  
on 24 April 2008 to all eligible employees in the UK, based on the Group's 
financial performance during 2007. These shares will be held in trust for 
up to five years.  
Sharesave Plan 
Grants were made under the BG Group Sharesave Scheme up to and 
including 2007. In December 2008, the first grants under the Sharesave 
Plan 2008 were made. The plan is approved by HM Revenue & Customs 
and enables eligible employees to acquire the Company's shares with 
the proceeds of a monthly savings contract. The contract period is three 
years. At 31 December 2008, 55% of eligible employees were participating 
in either the Sharesave Plan 2008 or the Sharesave Scheme, contributing 
an average monthly payment of  211. Of those participating, 59.5% were 
contributing the statutory maximum of  250 per month. 
PENSIONS 
The pension arrangements for Executive Directors are detailed on  
page 63. 
As detailed in note 27, page 108, BG Group operates a number of pension 
plans across the Group. Outside the UK, these plans are generally 
defined contribution (or money purchase) arrangements. In April 2007,  
a defined contribution plan was introduced in the UK for new hires. 
Employees who were already members of the defined benefit scheme 
continue to accrue benefits in that scheme. 
DILUTION 
The ABI has published guidelines relating to the disclosure of 
commitments to issue new shares or re-issue Treasury shares under a 
company's share-based schemes. In the event of all options and awards 
outstanding as at 31 December 2008 under BG Group's LTIP and LTIS 
(under which awards are planned to be satisfied by the re-issue of 
Treasury shares or by the issue of new shares) vesting and CSOS options 
becoming exercisable (under which options are currently satisfied by the 
issue of new shares) the resulting issue of new shares and re-issue of 
Treasury shares would amount to 1.67% of the issued share capital at 
that date.  
In the event of all options outstanding as at 31 December 2008 under  
BG Group's Sharesave Plan 2008 and Sharesave Scheme (which both 
involve the issue of new shares) becoming exercisable, the resulting issue 
would represent 0.07% of the issued ordinary share capital at that date. 
Partnership and Free Share awards made under the SIP during 2008 
were satisfied by the re-issue of Treasury shares. These awards 
represented 0.012% of the issued share capital as at 31 December 2008. 
The Company's intention is to continue to satisfy the future exercise  
of options and vesting awards under the above schemes by the issue  
of new shares and re-issue of Treasury shares as described above.  BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2008

SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES 
The Committee has adopted guidelines for Executive Directors, GEC 
members and certain other senior employees to encourage substantial 
long-term share ownership. These require that, over a period of five 
years from the introduction of the guidelines in 2002 (or date of 
appointment, if later), Executive Directors build up, and then retain, a 
holding of shares with a value equivalent to 200% of base salary. The 
required holding for other members of the GEC is 100% of base salary 
and for certain other senior employees is 50% of base salary. The 
guidelines require that, in relation to the 2002 and later LTIS and LTIP 
Performance Share and Group Share Awards, vested shares (net of tax) 
should be retained by the individual until the required shareholding  
level is reached. 
SERVICE CONTRACTS 
The Executive Directors' service contracts, including arrangements for 
early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee and are 
designed to recruit, retain and motivate Directors of the quality required 
to manage the Company. The Committee considers that a rolling 
contract with a notice period of one year is appropriate.  
In line with the Company's policy, the Executive Directors' service 
contracts contain change of control provisions. Should the Directors' 
employment be terminated within 12 months of a change of control, 
they are entitled to liquidated damages. The amount of liquidated 
damages is equal to one year's gross salary and a credit of one year's 
pensionable service (less any deductions the employer is required to 
make), which the Committee considers to be a genuine pre-estimate  
of loss. The Committee considers that these provisions assist with 
recruitment and retention and that their inclusion is therefore in  
the best interests of shareholders. 
Other than change of control, the Executive Directors' service contracts 
do not contain provisions for compensation in the event of early 
termination. When calculating termination payments, the Committee 
takes into account a variety of factors, including individual and Company 
performance, the obligation for the Director to mitigate his or her own 
loss (for example, by gaining new employment) and the Director's 
length of service. Further details of the Executive Directors' service 
contracts can be found on page 60. 
SENIOR EXECUTIVES BELOW THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
The policy and practice with regard to the remuneration of senior 
employees below the Executive Directors who are members of the GEC 
is entirely consistent with that for the Executive Directors. These senior 
executives all have a significant portion of their reward package linked  
to performance. They all qualify for AIS, and are eligible for awards (other 
than Group Share Awards) under the LTIP, and their financial targets  
are the same as, or cascaded from, the targets for the Executive Directors. 
The Committee reviews and approves the individual remuneration 
packages for the GEC members and the Company Secretary in 
accordance with the overriding objectives of the Group's remuneration 
policy. Their individual performance is reviewed and their increases in 
base salary, AIS payments, and any LTIP awards are subject to approval 
by the Committee each year. Other senior employees below GEC level 
are generally treated consistently with the Executive Directors and 
members of the GEC, with the exception that they may participate in 
local discretionary annual cash plans, and are eligible to receive Group 
Share Awards under the LTIP (in addition to Performance Share Awards 
and grants of Market Value Options) but still subject to the overall limits 
on levels of individual award under the LTIP.  
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
The Board aims to recruit non-executive Directors of a high calibre,  
with broad commercial, international or other relevant experience.  
Non-executive Directors are appointed by the Board on the 
recommendation of the Nominations Committee. Their appointment is 
for an initial term of three years, subject to election by shareholders at the 
first AGM following their appointment. Upon the recommendation of 
the Nominations Committee, they are generally re-appointed for a 
second term of three years, subject to re-election by shareholders.  
There is no notice period and no provision for termination payments.  
The terms of engagement of the non-executive Directors are set out  
in a letter of appointment. 
The basic annual fee paid to non-executive Directors was revised to  
 75 000 effective 1 July 2008. Additional fees are also payable, for 
example, for membership of, or chairing, a committee of the Board  
or acting as Senior Independent Director. Fees are reviewed every two 
years, taking into account time commitment, competition for high 
quality non-executive directors and market movements. The next  
review will be effective 1 July 2010. 
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the 
Company's share schemes, incentive schemes or pension schemes. 
CHAIRMAN 
Sir Robert Wilson was initially appointed as Chairman with effect from  
1 January 2004 and was re-appointed with effect from 1 January 2007. In 
line with the non-executive Directors, Sir Robert Wilson's re-appointment 
is for a three year term and there is no notice period and no provision for 
payment in the event of early termination. Sir Robert Wilson's fee was 
raised with effect from 1 January 2009 to  680 000 and is next subject 
to review on 1 January 2010.

(a) Other than the change of control provisions, the Executive Directors' service contracts do not contain provisions for compensation payable upon early termination. 
Change of control 
As described on page 59, the Executive Directors' service contracts contain change of control provisions. 
For the purposes of these provisions, a change of control is deemed to occur if the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company; or if 50% or more 
of the voting rights of the Company or the right to appoint or remove the majority of the Board of the Company become vested in any individual or body 
or group of individuals or bodies acting in concert; or if all or substantially all of the business, assets and undertakings of the Company become owned  
by any person, firm or company (other than a subsidiary or associated company). A change of control is also deemed to occur if the whole of the issued 
capital of BG Energy Holdings Limited or a substantial part of the undertaking of that Company (including its subsidiaries) is transferred to another 
company, unless that transferee company is a subsidiary of the Company, or a company ultimately owned by substantially the same shareholders  
as are the ultimate owners of the Company.   BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2008

However, a change of control does not occur if (and only if) through a process of reconstruction the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company 
owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the shareholders of the Company. The Executive Directors' service contracts provide that any 
payments made pursuant to these provisions will be made, less any deductions the employer is required to make. Any such payments shall be in full  
and final settlement of any claims the Executive Director may have against the employer or any associated company arising out of the termination  
of employment, except for any personal injury claim, any claim in respect of accrued pension rights, or statutory employment protection claims.

PENSIONS  
The basis on which retirement benefits are calculated for Ashley Almanza and Frank Chapman has not changed during the year. They receive an accrual 
of benefits designed to target a pension of two-thirds of their final 12 months' salary on retirement from BG Group at age 60, inclusive of retained 
benefits. As is the case for all other UK employees who became pension scheme members before 6 April 2006, they cannot be paid an immediate 
pension before age 60 on a non-actuarially reduced basis unless they have attained age 55 and completed ten years' service with the Group (including 
pensionable service transferred from previous employment) and the Company expressly agrees to payment on an unreduced basis, or they are over the 
age of 50 and have been made redundant, or in the event of incapacity. UK employees who became pension scheme members on or after 6 April 2006 
cannot be paid a non-actuarially reduced pension until age 60, other than in the event of incapacity. Pensions in payment are increased in line with  
retail price inflation. An adult dependant's pension is payable on death in service, equal to two-thirds of that payable to the pension scheme member 
based on potential service to age 65. On death in retirement, an adult dependant's pension is payable equal to two-thirds of the member's pension  
prior to exchanging any of it for a cash lump sum. 
Ashley Almanza and Frank Chapman were members of the BG Pension Scheme (BGPS) and the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme (BGSBS) 
throughout the year. The BGPS is a funded, registered pension scheme and the BGSBS is an unfunded, unregistered pension scheme. The allocation  
of their benefits between the registered and unregistered schemes changed after 6 April 2006, when a new pensions taxation regime came into  
force. Their BGPS benefits are limited to the  lifetime allowance' and the balance of their benefits is provided by the BGSBS. Frank Chapman elected 
 enhanced protection' under the new regime and therefore has a personal lifetime allowance that is based on the value of his accrued BGPS benefits  
at 6 April 2006. 
A provision has been made in the Company's accounts in respect of the obligations for unfunded post-retirement benefits.

(c) The transfer values shown at the end of 2007 and 2008 represent the value of each Executive Director's accrued pension based on total service completed to the relevant date.  
The accrued pensions are the amounts that would have been paid if the Executive Director had left service at the relevant date. The transfer values are calculated in accordance  
with the requirements of the transfer value regulations or the guidance note GN11 (issued by the Board for Actuarial Standards) as applicable at the date of the calculation.
