Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors' Report
on remuneration for 2009 which we will be submitting for shareholder
approval at our Annual General Meeting.
As the Chairman has indicated in his statement, the global economic
downturn created a challenging operating environment during 2009.
Nevertheless, BG Group has delivered a solid set of results which have
been reflected in the 2009 Annual Incentive Scheme awards to the
Executive Directors (see pages 52 and 56) - although these are
somewhat lower than in previous years.
The Group must attract, retain and motivate the executive talent
required for the successful delivery of its integrated gas strategy. The
Remuneration Committee is focused on ensuring that the Group's
remuneration policy is strongly geared towards performance-related
reward over the longer term. This approach aligns the interests of
executives with those of shareholders while ensuring that the Group
offers remuneration which continues to be competitive.
The Committee will closely monitor developments in the external
environment over the months ahead to ensure that the Group's
remuneration policy:
  continues to take appropriate account of the management
of business risk when evaluating performance, with a focus
on the delivery of sustained returns to shareholders;
  supports the Group's continued evolution; and
  reflects the need to compete for talent in the international gas
and oil employment market.
The Committee considers that the key components of remuneration
which were put in place during 2008 continue to be appropriate. These
components and their operation are discussed further in this Report.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank shareholders for their
continued support.

REMUNERATION POLICY
The central premise of BG Group's remuneration policy is that
while total reward should be market competitive, the majority of
remuneration should be delivered through performance-related
incentives. Performance-related incentive schemes are designed to align
the interests of executives with those of shareholders and establish a
clear link between sustained individual and corporate performance.
In defining BG Group's remuneration policy, the Committee takes
into account advice received from external consultants and also best
practice guidelines set by institutional shareholder bodies, including
the principles and guidelines on executive remuneration issued by
the Association of British Insurers (ABI).
T o implement the policy, BG Group has a well-developed, Group-wide
performance management system and, during 2009, operated two
performance-related incentive arrangements for executives:
  the Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS) - designed to focus executives
on the business priorities of the financial year and to reinforce the
individual and Company performance ethic; and
  the Long T erm Incentive Plan (LTIP) - the LTIP is designed to reward
and retain executives over the longer term while also aligning their
interests with those of BG Group shareholders. The LTIP allows for
various types of awards to be made (specifically Group Share Awards,
Performance Share Awards and Market Value Options). Executive
Directors and members of the GEC may only be awarded Performance
Share Awards and Market Value Options. For the annual LTIP awards
made in September 2009, Executive Directors and members of the
GEC received grants of Performance Share Awards. Performance Share
Awards aim to motivate participants to maximise total shareholder
return (TSR)
(c)
as measured against a weighted index comprising a
selection of sector comparators over a period of three years.
The two incentive arrangements complement each other and enable
the measurement and reward of both short and long-term performance.
In particular, the Committee considers these complementary incentive
arrangements take appropriate account of business risk and align the
reward arrangements of executives with the delivery of sustained
returns to shareholders. The Committee continues to consider that the
three-year vesting period for the LTIP is appropriate.
COMPONENTS OF REMUNERATION
The current remuneration package for Executive Directors comprises
fixed and variable components. The variable components are the
incentive arrangements referred to above and the fixed components
are base salary, taxable benefits and pension entitlements. In addition,
the Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Company's
all-employee share plans. Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in
the Group have been taken into account by the Committee in determining
the remuneration packages for Executive Directors. The Committee has
also followed the provisions of Schedule A to the Combined Code that
relate to the design of performance-related remuneration.
The proportion of each Executive Director's total remuneration that
is performance-related is significant even for target performance.
For stretch performance, the proportion of total remuneration
that is performance-related is higher, as is the total amount of
remuneration payable.
The average proportion of remuneration (including pension) that was
performance-related in 2009 is illustrated by the following chart. In
estimating the relative contribution of those elements of remuneration
that are, and those that are not, performance-related as required by the
Regulations, a number of assumptions have had to be made about the
Company's share price growth and TSR relative to the weighted index,
over the next three years.
Base salaries
Executive Directors' salaries are reviewed each year with any changes
normally taking effect from 1 April. This review takes into account
individual performance, experience and market competitiveness.
Pensionable salary is derived from base salary only.
In line with BG Group's remuneration policy, the Committee
benchmarks Executive Directors' salaries against a comparator group,
which, for the 2009 salary review, was the FTSE 30, excluding financial
services companies. Executive Director salaries are between the median
and upper quartile for this comparator group. The Committee believes
this positioning is appropriate given the significantly higher total
reward levels at other international gas and oil companies with which
BG Group competes for talent.
Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS)
In 2009, the AIS provided an incentive opportunity in the range of 0%
to 200% of base salary. The maximum annual incentive opportunity
for the Chief Executive was 200% of salary and for the other Executive
Directors was 150% of salary. All GEC AIS awards up to 100% of salary are
paid in cash and any excess over 100% are deferred into share awards
(under the Deferred Bonus Plan) that are not normally released to the
individual for a period of three years and which are subject to forfeiture
in the event of leaving employment (other than for reason of ill health,
agreed retirement or redundancy). In the event of a change of control,
the deferred share awards will vest.
At the start of the incentive year (1 January), the Board sets challenging
budget and stretch financial performance targets and the Committee
endorses other performance measures, notably with respect to
health, safety and environmental indicators. Bonuses at the higher
end of the range are payable only for demonstrably superior Group
and individual performance.

(c) TSR is defined as the return on investment obtained from holding a company's
shares over a period. It includes dividends paid, the change in the capital value of
the shares and other payments to or by shareholders within the period. TSR is
calculated on a common currency basis to ensure that international comparisons
are fair. The Committee believes that TSR relative to a peer group is an
appropriate measure of relative performance. Directors' Report: Corporate Governance

For the Executive Directors, the performance measures for the 2009
incentive year were Earnings per Share (EPS)
(a)
(and in the case of the
Executive Vice President and Managing Director, Americas and Global
LNG regional profit before interest and tax (PBIT)

Executive Vice President and Managing Director, Americas and Global
LNG regional ROACE
(c)(d)
), performance against a health, safety and
environment (HSE) balanced scorecard
(e)
and achievements against the
individual's personal scorecard. The Committee considers that these are
the appropriate measures to assess the performance of the Company.
In determining the actual incentive payment, the Committee follows
a three-stage process. Firstly, performance against the financial and
HSE targets is assessed. Secondly, these results are reviewed in the
context of the underlying performance of the business, taking into
consideration such factors as operational performance, strategy and
business development activities, and performance against industry
peers. Thirdly, the Committee considers the performance of the
individual against their personal scorecard.
For the 2009 incentive year, financial performance against both the
Group EPS and ROACE targets and the HSE balanced scorecard was
rated as between target and stretch. Taking into account these results
and overall business and individual performance, the Committee has
awarded the Chief Executive an AIS award of 140% of base salary; the
Chief Financial Officer
(f)
an AIS award of 100% of base salary and the
Executive Vice President and Managing Director, Americas and Global
LNG an AIS award of 114 % of base salary.
In each case, cash payments equating to up to 100% of base salary
will be made in March 2010, the balance being made in the form of
a deferred share award (under the Deferred Bonus Plan) which will
normally vest in March 2013.

Long-term incentives
The narrative below relates to the plans that operated during the 2009
financial year.
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP has operated and awards have been made under it since its
introduction in May 2008.
The LTIP is designed to reward and retain executives over the longer term
while also aligning their interests with those of BG Group shareholders.
The LTIP allows for various types of awards to be made, namely, Group
Share Awards, Performance Share Awards and Market Value Options.
When making the decision on the level of award, the Committee takes
into consideration a number of factors including face value, Estimated
Present Value (EPV) and plan dilution limits.
The face value of an award is equal to the number of shares, or shares
under option, multiplied by the relevant share price. For awards made
under the LTIP in 2009, the relevant share price of an LTIP award is the
average share price for the five dealing days immediately prior to the
date of award. A face value limit of six times salary applies to each
award, subject to the aggregate of all awards not exceeding the EPV
limit described below.
EPV is a measure that describes the economic or fair value of an award.
The measure takes account of the performance conditions and the
risk that grants and allocations may be forfeited. EPV is calculated
independently by Kepler Associates. The overriding EPV limit which
applied to awards made under the LTIP in 2009 (other than in
exceptional circumstances such as recruitment
(g)
was 300% of salary.
The maximum EPV that was awarded in 2009 (other than in exceptional
circumstances such as recruitment
(h)
) was 264%.
Performance Share Awards
A limited number of key employees are granted Performance Share
Awards under the LTIP .
For the annual LTIP award made in September 2009, Executive Directors
and members of the GEC were only granted Performance Share Awards.
Performance Share Awards will normally vest three years after the date
of grant. The vesting is conditional on:
  continued employment;
  the individual employee's performance not having fallen significantly
below that expected since the date of grant; and
  the Company's TSR performance over a three-year performance
period. This is detailed further below.
There is a further overriding condition that the Committee must be
satisfied that the underlying performance of the Company justifies
the level of vesting.

average capital employed. Regional ROACE is measured in a similar way to
Group ROACE except that returns are measured before tax.

and lagging indicators reflecting the Group's commitment to HSE, and is
designed to ensure that HSE performance is explicitly considered within the
incentive framework.
(f) The Chief Financial Officer was also appointed Managing Director, Europe
and Central Asia in November 2009 on an interim basis. In view of the short time
in this role, the Committee considered it appropriate that no change should be
made to the performance metrics detailed above for the Chief Financial Officer
for the 2009 incentive year.

Information
TSR performance for the Performance Share Awards is measured over
a three-year performance period commencing on the first day of
the calendar month in which the award is made. There is no retest
provision. The level of Performance Share Awards vesting is related to
the Company's TSR performance over this period relative to a weighted
index of a selection of industry peers. The constituents of the Index for
the September 2009 awards were:
Group Share Awards
Awards of Group Share Awards are made to certain employees below
GEC level. Eligibility to be considered for an award varies by jurisdiction.
Group Share Awards will normally vest three years after the date of
grant subject to:
  continued employment; and
  the individual employee's performance not having fallen significantly
below that expected since the date of grant.
In the event of a change of control, the level of vesting of Group Share
Awards under the LTIP may be subject to time pro-rating if the
Committee considers it appropriate given the circumstances of the
change of control.
Prior to 2008, the Executive Directors and other employees participated
in the Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS) and Company Share Option
Scheme (CSOS). No further awards will be made under these plans.
No Market Value Options were awarded in 2009.
Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS)
Vesting of LTIS awards is conditional on the Company's TSR performance
relative to a comparator group of industry peers over a three-year period
which runs from the date of grant. The proportion of the LTIS award that
vests is dependent on BG Group's position in this comparator group.
There is no retest provision.
In the event of a change of control, vesting of shares under the LTIS
is not automatic and would depend upon the extent to which the
performance conditions had been met at that time. Time pro-rating
will apply if the Committee considers that this is appropriate given
the circumstances of the change of control.
The following performance conditions apply for awards made under
the LTIS:
BG Group's TSR position in comparator group % of allocated shares transferred
First 100
Upper quartile 75
Median 30
Below median All allocated shares are forfeited
Where performance is between upper quartile and first or between
median and upper quartile, the percentage of shares to be transferred
is determined on a proportionate basis.
The performance period for the 2006 allocation ended on
3 September 2009. BG Group's final TSR for this period relative to
the TSR of companies in the relevant comparator group was measured
by the independent TSR monitoring service of Alithos Limited and
reviewed by Kepler Associates. This analysis placed BG Group in first
position. The Committee therefore decided, in accordance with the
performance condition for the 2006 allocation, that 100% of the
original award of shares had vested and, accordingly, these shares
were transferred to the participating employees on 7 September 2009.
For the 2006 allocation, the comparator group comprised BG Group
and the following 16 companies:
Amerada Hess Corporation; Anadarko Petroleum Corporation; BP plc;
Chevron Corporation; ConocoPhillips; Duke Energy Corporation;
El Paso Corporation; ENI S.p.A.; Exxon Mobil Corporation; Marathon Oil
Corporation; Norsk Hydro ASA; Occidental Petroleum Corporation;
Repsol YPF S.A.; Royal Dutch Shell plc; Statoil ASA and T otal S.A.
For the 2007 allocation, the group was reduced by one, following the
merger of Statoil ASA and Norsk Hydro ASA's petroleum activities.

Corporation
  Repsol YPF S.A.
  Royal Dutch Shell plc
  StatoilHydro ASA
  Suncor Energy Inc.
  Talisman Energy Inc.
  Total S.A.
  Woodside
Petroleum Ltd.
Of these companies, nine are headquartered in the USA, one in the UK,
two in Canada, one in Australia and five elsewhere in Europe.
The constituents of the Index for the September 2008 awards were
identical to those listed above, except that Suncor Energy Inc. was not
an Index constituent and Petro-Canada was included in the Index up
to the date of the completion of its acquisition by Suncor Energy Inc.
in August 2009.
The vesting of the Performance Share Awards is illustrated below:
If BG Group's TSR performance is less than the Index TSR performance
over the performance period, the Performance Share Award will lapse.
If BG Group's TSR performance meets the Index TSR performance over
the performance period, 25% of the Performance Share Award will vest.
If BG Group's TSR performance exceeds the Index TSR performance over
the performance period by 7% p.a. or more, 100% of the Performance
Share Award will vest.
Between these two points the percentage vesting will be on a linear
sliding scale basis.
The TSR outperformance calculation is multiplicative, that is, if the
Index grows from 100% to 110%, then BG Group is required to move
from 100% to 134.75% (i.e. 110% x 107%
3
) over three years to achieve
maximum vesting.
In the event of a change of control, vesting of Performance Share
Awards under the LTIP is not automatic and would depend on the
extent to which performance conditions had been met at that time.
Time pro-rating will apply if the Committee considers it appropriate
given the circumstances of the change of control.

Company Share Option Scheme (CSOS)
The option price is based on the market value at the date of grant.
Options may only be exercised three years from the date of grant
subject to both continued employment and achievement of a financial
performance condition. This performance condition determines if and
the extent to which options may be exercised. It is based on BG Group's
EPS
(a)
growth relative to the growth in the RPIX over a period of three
financial years relative to the financial year which ended immediately
prior to the date of grant. The Committee considers that an EPS
performance measure ensures that employees receive rewards only
when the Company has achieved sustained earnings growth during the
performance period. The calculation of EPS growth for grants made on
or after 21 July 2004 has been made using constant commodity prices
and constant exchange rates. There is no retest provision. Subject to
the above conditions the option may be exercised (in whole or in part)
at any time up to the expiry of 10 years from the date of grant.
% EPS growth over RPIX (over 3 years) % of options that are exercisable
30 or greater 100
15 50
Less than 15 Options are forfeited
A proportion of between half and all of the options will be exercisable
if the Company achieves EPS growth over three years of RPIX plus
between 15% and 30%, respectively.
Over the three-year performance period for the 2006 CSOS grant, the
Company's EPS growth above the growth in the RPIX exceeded 30%.
As a result, 100% of the shares under the options granted to employees
in September 2006 are exercisable prior to September 2016.
In the event of a change of control, exercise of an option under the
CSOS is not automatic and would depend upon the extent to which
the performance condition had been satisfied at the time.
All-employee share plans
In order to encourage share ownership, the Company currently provides
two all-employee UK HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) approved share
plans for its UK employees.
Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
The SIP is approved by HMRC. Two elements of the SIP operated
during 2009, the Partnership Shares Plan and the Flex Shares Plan.
(a) Partnership Shares
Eligible employees are offered the opportunity to buy Company shares
from pre-tax earnings as part of a regular share purchase plan. Shares
are currently purchased every six months using employees' accumulated
deductions and are placed in trust.
At 31 December 2009, 73.0% (31 December 2008 70.5%) of eligible
employees were participating in this plan. Of those participating,
81% (31 December 2008 80%) were contributing the maximum of
 125 per month.
(b) Flex Shares
Flex Share allocations were made to all eligible employees as part of
the UK flexible benefits plan. Flex Share Awards of up to a maximum
of 273 shares, representing the maximum value allowed within the
 3 000 statutory limit, were made on 7 April 2009 to all eligible
employees in the UK who accepted their allocation. These shares will
be held in trust for up to five years.
Sharesave Plan
Grants were made under the BG Group Sharesave Scheme up to and
including 2007. From 2008, grants have been made under the Sharesave
Plan 2008. The plan is approved by HMRC and enables eligible employees
to acquire the Company's shares with the proceeds of a monthly savings
contract. The contract period is three years. At 31 December 2009, 79.5% of
eligible employees were participating in either the Sharesave Plan 2008 or
its predecessor, the Sharesave Scheme, contributing an average monthly
payment of  226. Of those participating, 81.7% were contributing the
statutory maximum of  250 per month.
Remuneration report continued

PENSIONS
The pension arrangements for Executive Directors are detailed on page 60.
As detailed in note 25, page 107, BG Group operates a number of pension
plans across the Group. Outside the UK, these plans are generally
defined contribution (or money purchase) arrangements. In April 2007,
a defined contribution plan was introduced in the UK for new hires.
Employees who were already members of the defined benefit scheme
continue to accrue benefits in that scheme.
DILUTION
The ABI has published guidelines relating to the disclosure of
commitments to issue new shares or re-issue Treasury shares under a
company's share-based schemes. In the event of all options and awards
outstanding as at 31 December 2009 under BG Group's LTIP and LTIS
(under which awards are planned to be satisfied by the re-issue of
Treasury shares or by the issue of new shares) vesting, and all CSOS
options becoming exercisable (under which options are currently
satisfied by the issue of new shares), the resulting issue of new shares
and re-issue of Treasury shares would amount to 1.33% of the issued
share capital at that date.
In the event of all options outstanding as at 31 December 2009 under
BG Group's Sharesave Plan 2008 and Sharesave Scheme (which both
involve the issue of new shares), becoming exercisable, the resulting
issue would represent 0.07% of the issued ordinary share capital at
that date.
Partnership and Flex Share awards made under the SIP during 2009
were satisfied by the re-issue of Treasury shares. These awards
represented 0.015% of the issued share capital as at 31 December 2009.
The Company's intention is to continue to satisfy the future exercise of
options and vesting of awards under the above schemes by the issue
of new shares and re-issue of Treasury shares as described above.
SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES
The Committee has adopted guidelines for Executive Directors, GEC
members and certain other senior employees to encourage substantial
long-term share ownership. These specify that, over a period of five
years from the date of appointment, Executive Directors build up, and
then retain, a holding of shares with a value equivalent to 200% of base
salary. The required holding for other members of the GEC is 100% of
base salary and for certain other senior employees is 50% of base salary.
The guidelines require that, in relation to the LTIS and LTIP Performance
Share and Group Share Awards and Deferred Bonus Plan awards, vested
shares (net of tax) should be retained by the individual until the
required shareholding level is reached.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
The Executive Directors' service contracts, including arrangements
for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee and
are designed to recruit, retain and motivate Directors of the quality
required to manage the Company. The Committee considers that a
rolling contract with a notice period of one year is appropriate.
In line with the Company's policy, the Executive Directors' service
contracts contain change of control provisions. Should the Directors'
employment be terminated within 12 months of a change of control,
they are entitled to liquidated damages. The amount of liquidated
damages is equal to one year's gross salary and a credit of one year's
pensionable service (less any deductions the employer is required to
make), which the Committee considers to be a genuine pre-estimate
of loss. The Committee considers that these provisions assist with
recruitment and retention and that their inclusion is therefore in the
best interests of shareholders.
Other than change of control, the Executive Directors' service contracts
do not contain provisions for compensation in the event of early
termination. When calculating termination payments, the Committee
takes into account a variety of factors, including individual and
Company performance, the obligation for the Director to mitigate his
or her own loss (for example, by gaining new employment) and the

SENIOR EXECUTIVES BELOW THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The policy and practice with regard to the remuneration of senior
employees below the Executive Directors who are members of the
GEC is entirely consistent with that for the Executive Directors. These
senior executives all have a significant portion of their reward package
linked to performance. They all qualify for AIS, and are eligible for
awards (other than Group Share Awards) under the LTIP , and their
financial targets are the same as, or cascaded from, the targets for
the Executive Directors. The Committee reviews and approves the
individual remuneration packages for the GEC members and the
Company Secretary in accordance with the overriding objectives of the
Group's remuneration policy. Their individual performance is reviewed
and their increases in base salary, AIS payments, and any LTIP awards are
subject to approval by the Committee each year. Other senior employees
below GEC level are generally treated consistently with the Executive
Directors and members of the GEC, with the exception that they may
participate in local discretionary annual cash plans, and are eligible to
receive Group Share Awards under the LTIP (in addition to Performance
Share Awards and grants of Market Value Options) but are still subject
to the overall limits on levels of individual award under the LTIP .
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Board aims to recruit non-executive directors of a high calibre,
with broad commercial, international or other relevant experience.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed by the Board on the
recommendation of the Nominations Committee. Their appointment
is for an initial term of three years, subject to election by shareholders
at the first annual general meeting (AGM) following their appointment.
Upon the recommendation of the Nominations Committee, they are
generally re-appointed for a second term of three years, subject to
re-election by shareholders. There is no notice period and no provision
for termination payments.
The terms of engagement of the Non-Executive Directors are set out
in a letter of appointment.
The basic annual fee paid to Non-Executive Directors is  75 000.
Additional fees are also payable, for example, for membership of, or
chairing, a Committee of the Board and acting as Senior Independent
Director. Fees are reviewed every two years, taking into account time
commitment, competition for high quality non-executive directors
and market movements. The next review will be effective 1 July 2010.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the
Company's share schemes, incentive schemes or pension schemes.
T o facilitate the alignment of the interests of the Non-Executive
Directors with those of shareholders, the Group has put in place a
Non-Executive Directors' share purchase programme through which
Non-Executive Directors may elect to invest a proportion of their fees,
net of tax, on a regular basis to acquire BG Group shares on the open
market. The first deductions were made under this programme in
January 2010 and the first market purchases will be made in March 2010.
CHAIRMAN
Sir Robert Wilson was initially appointed as Chairman with effect
from 1 January 2004. He was first re-appointed for a three-year term
with effect from 1 January 2007 and following due consideration was
re-appointed with effect from 1 January 2010. In line with the
Non-Executive Directors, Sir Robert Wilson's re-appointment is for
a three-year term and there is no notice period and no provision for
payment in the event of early termination. Sir Robert Wilson's fee was
raised with effect from 1 January 2010 to  700 000 and is next subject
to review in January 2011.

(a)  Other than the change of control provisions, the Executive Directors' service contracts do not contain provisions for compensation payable upon early termination. 
Change of control 
As described on page 54, the Executive Directors' service contracts contain change of control provisions. 
For the purposes of these provisions, a change of control is deemed to occur if the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company; or if 50% or more  
of the voting rights of the Company or the right to appoint or remove the majority of the Board of the Company become vested in any individual or body or 
group of individuals or bodies acting in concert; or if all or substantially all of the business, assets and undertakings of the Company become owned by any 
person, firm or company (other than a subsidiary or associated company). A change of control is also deemed to occur if the whole of the issued capital of 
BG Energy Holdings Limited or a substantial part of the undertaking of that Company (including its subsidiaries) is transferred to another company, unless 
that transferee company is a subsidiary of the Company, or a company ultimately owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the ultimate 
owners of the Company.  
However, a change of control does not occur if (and only if) through a process of reconstruction the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company 
owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the shareholders of the Company. The Executive Directors' service contracts provide that any 
payments made pursuant to these provisions will be made, less any deductions the employer is required to make. Any such payments shall be in full  
and final settlement of any claims the Executive Director may have against the employer or any associated company arising out of the termination of 
employment, except for any personal injury claim, any claim in respect of accrued pension rights, or statutory employment protection claims.

(a) Executive Directors only received grants of Performance Share Awards. All Performance Share Awards granted to UK employees in September 2009 were granted in the form  
of nil-cost options. Under normal circumstances, the awards will not vest and the options will not become exercisable until after the end of the three-year vesting period which 
commenced on 7 September 2009. The options are exercisable until the seventh anniversary of the vesting date but will vest automatically on an employee leaving the 
Company if not already exercised. The level of vesting is dependent on the achievement of specified performance criteria at the end of the three-year performance period. The 
performance conditions for the 2009 awards are set out on page 52. 
(b) The transfer of shares awarded is dependent on the achievement of performance criteria at the end of the three-year performance period. The performance conditions for the

As of 10 March 2010, the Directors' interests in the share capital of the Company represent less than 1% of the issued share capital of the Company. 
SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES 
As stated on page 54, the Executive Directors are required to build up, and then retain, a shareholding with a value equivalent to 200% of their base salary. 
The table below sets out, in respect of each Executive Director, how far this requirement had been achieved as at 31 December 2009.

Martin Houston 525    7 608     200 1 449
(a) Base salary is annual salary following the 2009 Salary Review and effective from 1 April 2009. 
(b)  The value of shareholdings is based on the closing price of a BG Group ordinary share on 31 December 2009. 
PENSIONS  
The basis on which retirement benefits are calculated for Ashley Almanza and Frank Chapman has not changed during the year. They receive an accrual  
of benefits designed to target a pension of two-thirds of their final 12 months' salary on retirement from BG Group at age 60. Martin Houston has been  
a member of the GEC since 2000 and was appointed as a Director of the Board with effect from 3 February 2009, and there has been no change to his 
pension arrangements. He continues to accrue pension at the rate of 1/60 of his final 12 months' salary for each year of pensionable service.  
As is the case for all other UK employees who became pension scheme members before 6 April 2006, none of the Directors can be paid an immediate 
pension before age 60 on a non-actuarially reduced basis unless they have attained age 55 and completed ten years' service with the Group (including 
pensionable service transferred from previous employment) and the Company expressly agrees to payment on an unreduced basis, or they are over the  
age of 50 and have been made redundant, or in the event of incapacity. UK employees who became pension scheme members on or after 6 April 2006 
cannot be paid a non-actuarially reduced pension until age 60, other than in the event of incapacity. Pensions in payment are increased in line with retail 
price inflation. An adult dependant's pension is payable on death in service, equal to two-thirds of that payable to the pension scheme member based  
on potential service to age 65. On death in retirement, an adult dependant's pension is payable equal to two-thirds of the member's pension prior to 
exchanging any of it for a cash lump sum. 
Ashley Almanza, Frank Chapman and Martin Houston were members of the BG Pension Scheme (BGPS) and the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme 
(BGSBS) throughout the year. The BGPS is a funded, registered pension scheme and the BGSBS is an unfunded, unregistered pension scheme. The 
allocation of their benefits between the registered and unregistered schemes changed after 6 April 2006, when a new pensions taxation regime came  
into force. Their BGPS benefits are limited to the  lifetime allowance' and the balance of their benefits is provided by the BGSBS. Frank Chapman and 
Martin Houston elected  enhanced protection' under the new regime and therefore both have personal lifetime allowances that are based on the value  
of their accrued BGPS benefits at 6 April 2006. 
A provision has been made in the Company's accounts in respect of the obligations for unfunded post-retirement benefits.

(a)  The Directors paid pension contributions up to 31 March 2009. Thereafter a 'salary sacrifice' system operated under which the Company made contributions on behalf of each 
Director and reduced their salary by a corresponding amount.  
(b)  Actual increase. 
(c)  Increase net of price inflation. No adjustment is made in Martin Houston's case as the date on which he became a Director was less than one year before 31 December 2009. 
(d)  The transfer values shown at the end of 2008 and 2009 represent the value of each Executive Director's accrued pension based on total service completed to the relevant date. 
The accrued pensions are the amounts that would have been paid if the Executive Director had left service at the relevant date. The transfer values are calculated in accordance 
with the requirements of the transfer value regulations. Increases in transfer values since 31 December 2008 have been significantly affected by changes in market conditions 
over the year and amendments to the actuarial factors used which were reviewed following completion of the 2008 BGPS funding valuation in August 2009. 
(e)  The figures for Martin Houston have been determined by reference to his appointment date of 3 February 2009, rather than 31 December 2008, which is used for  
Frank Chapman and Ashley Almanza.
