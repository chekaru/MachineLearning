Remuneration Committee
The Committee's principal responsibilities are:
   setting, reviewing and recommending to the 
Board for approval the Group's overall 
remuneration policy and strategy;
   setting, reviewing and approving individual 
remuneration arrangements for the 
Chairman, Chief Executive and Executive 
Directors, including terms and conditions 
of employment and any changes;
   reviewing and approving individual 
remuneration arrangements for the Group 
Executive Committee (GEC) members and 
the Company Secretary, including terms and 
conditions of employment and any changes;
   approving the rules and launch of any Group 
share, share option or cash-based incentive 
plan, and the grant, award, allocation or issue 
of shares, share options or payments under 
any such plan; and 
   approving changes to the BG Pension Scheme 
rules or changes to funding and management 
arrangements.
The full terms of reference of the Committee 
can be found on the BG Group website  
(www.bg-group.com) and copies are available 
on request.
Keith Hubber, Company Secretary, attended 
meetings as Secretary to the Committee.
The following individuals attended 
meetings by invitation and provided advice 
to the Committee to enable it to make 
informed decisions:
  Frank Chapman, Chief Executive; and
   Robert Booker, Executive Vice President, 
Human Resources.
No individual was present when their own 
remuneration was being discussed.
The Committee believes that the Group's 
overall remuneration policy continues to be 
appropriate. There is strong emphasis on 
performance-related reward. The Annual 
Incentive Scheme (AIS) and the Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP) form a significant part of 
the reward opportunity for executives. Reward 
under these incentive arrangements is subject 
to challenging performance criteria which are 
aligned with the Group's strategic objectives.
Consideration is given to both the delivery 
of sustained returns to shareholders and 
the effective management of business risk 
when setting performance criteria under 
these incentives. Awards under the AIS 
are subject to individual as well as Group 
performance, measured against a range 
of financial and non-financial performance 
measures. The performance-related 
elements of remuneration are regularly 
reviewed by the Committee to ensure they 
continue to be appropriate and support the 
Group's strategic objectives, and they will 
be reviewed again during 2011. 
During 2010 we made a small change to 
the AIS, providing eligible employees with 
the ability to choose voluntarily to take a 
proportion of their bonuses in the form of 
BG Group shares, over and above the elements 
that they may be required to defer.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
shareholders for their continued support.
Baroness Hogg 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is focused on ensuring 
BG Group's remuneration policy enables it to attract, 
retain and motivate executive talent, and aligns 
executives' incentives with shareholders' interests.
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present the Directors' report on remuneration 
for 2010, for which we will be seeking 
approval from shareholders at our Annual 
General Meeting.
BG Group's remuneration policy continues 
to be focused on enabling the Group to 
attract, retain and motivate the executive 
talent required for the delivery of its growth 
strategy in a competitive international 
market, and ensuring that remuneration 
is linked to the long-term performance 
of the Group. The Committee pays close 
attention to the evolution of best corporate 
governance practice in the design of its 
remuneration framework. 250

Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information
Summary of BG Group's remuneration policy for Executive Directors
(c)
 and other members 
of the Group Executive Committee:
Market competitive  
and aligned with 
governance codes
   It is designed to deliver reward which will facilitate the recruitment, 
retention and motivation of the executive talent necessary to 
successfully deliver BG Group's growth strategy.
   It takes appropriate account of corporate governance codes and best 
practice guidelines published by regulators and institutional 
shareholder bodies.
Performance-related 
and aligned to 
long-term shareholder 
value
   At the Executive Director and senior manager levels, the majority of the 
reward opportunity is provided through performance-related incentives.
   Reward under these incentives is linked to both individual and BG Group's 
performance. When setting targets and assessing performance, 
appropriate account is taken of business risk and the delivery of 
sustained returns to shareholders.
   Bonus amounts in excess of 100% of salary are automatically deferred 
in shares for a period of three years, and long-term incentive vesting  
is subject to BG Group's three-year total shareholder return (TSR)
(d)
 
performance. Long-term holding of vested shares is further encouraged 
by BG Group's shareholding guidelines.
Shareholder-aligned   The performance-related incentive arrangements are designed to align 
the interests of executives with those of shareholders and establish a 
clear link between sustained individual and corporate performance.
   BG Group's shareholding guidelines encourage Executive Directors, 
GEC members and certain other senior employees to build up 
(over a period of five years from appointment) and retain a minimum 
holding of shares.
The Committee also meets without 
management and receives information and 
independent executive remuneration advice 
from Kepler Associates
(a)
, an external consultancy 
appointed by the Committee. During 2010, 
Kepler Associates provided advice to the 
Committee on market trends, incentive schemes 
and other remuneration issues. Kepler Associates 
does not advise the Group on any other issues.
Other external advisers also provided support 
and advice in relation to executive remuneration 
to the Committee. Linklaters LLP
(a)
 provided legal 
advice on employee incentives (as well as other 
legal services to the Group). Towers Watson
(a)
 
provided general compensation, benefits 
information and actuarial advice to the 
Committee, the Group and the Trustees of 
the BG Pension Scheme and, until 11 August 2010, 
to the Trustees of the Ballylumford Power 
Pension Scheme
(b)
, as well as other general 
consultancy services to the Group. These advisers 
are appointed by management or the relevant 
trustees as appropriate.
Executive Directors
Remuneration policy
In defining BG Group's remuneration policy, 
the Committee takes into account advice 
received from external consultants and also  
best practice guidelines set by regulators and 
institutional shareholder bodies, including 
the principles and guidelines on executive 
remuneration issued by the Association of 
British Insurers (ABI). The Committee has 
also followed the principles of Section D  
of the UK Corporate Governance Code that 
relate to remuneration.
The current intention is that the framework 
of this remuneration policy will apply for 
future years.
To implement this policy, BG Group has a 
well-developed, Group-wide performance 
management system and, during 2010, 
operated two performance-related incentive 
arrangements for executives:  
   the Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS) - 
designed to focus executives on the 
business priorities of the financial year  
and to reinforce the individual and Group 
performance ethic; and
   the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) - the LTIP 
is designed to reward and retain executives 
over the longer term while also aligning 
their interests with those of BG Group 
shareholders. The LTIP allows for various 
types of awards to be made (specifically 
Group Share Awards, Performance Share 
Awards and Market Value Options). Executive 
Directors and members of the GEC may only 
be awarded Performance Share Awards and 
Market Value Options. For the annual LTIP 
awards made in September 2010, Executive 
Directors and members of the GEC received 
grants of Performance Share Awards only. 
Performance Share Awards aim to motivate 
participants to maximise TSR
(d)
, as measured 
against a weighted index comprising a 
selection of sector comparators over a period 
of three years.
The two incentive arrangements complement each 
other and enable the measurement and reward  
of both short and long-term performance.  
In particular, the Committee considers that  
these complementary incentive arrangements 
take appropriate account of business risk and align 
the reward arrangements of executives with the 
delivery of sustained returns to shareholders. 
The Committee continues to consider that 
(a)  Kepler Associates, Linklaters LLP and Towers Watson have 
given, and not withdrawn, their written consent to the 
issue of this document with the inclusion of the reference 
to their respective names in the form and content in which 
they appear. A copy of each consent letter is available for 
inspection at BG Group plc, 100 Thames Valley Park Drive, 
Reading, Berkshire RG6 1PT.
(b)  The Ballylumford Power Pension Scheme was a BG Group 
pension scheme until the sale of Premier Power Limited 
completed on 11 August 2010. 
(c)  This policy will also apply to the remuneration of Fabio Barbosa 
when he takes up his post on 31 March 2011.
(d)  TSR is defined as the return on investment obtained from 
holding a company's shares over a period. It includes 
dividends paid, the change in the capital value of the shares 
and other payments to or by shareholders within the period. 
TSR is calculated on a common currency basis to ensure that 
international comparisons are fair. The Committee believes 
that TSR relative to a weighted peer group index is an 
appropriate measure of relative performance.
The graph above shows BG Group's TSR
(d)
 performance for 
the five year period ended 31 December 2010 (calculated 
in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report 
Regulations 2002 (the Regulations )) against the 
performance of the FTSE 100.
The FTSE 100 was chosen because this is a recognised broad 
equity market index of which the Company is a member.  Composition of remuneration package

the three-year vesting period for the LTIP 
is appropriate.
Shareholding guidelines
The Committee has adopted guidelines 
for Executive Directors, GEC members and 
certain other senior employees to encourage 
substantial long-term share ownership. These 
specify that, over a period of five years from 
the date of appointment, Executive Directors 
should build up, and then retain, a holding of 
shares with a value equivalent to 200% of base 
salary. The required holding for other members 
of the GEC is 100% of base salary and for 
certain other senior employees is 50% of base 
salary. The guidelines require that, in relation 
to the LTIS and LTIP Performance Share and 
Group Share Awards and Deferred Bonus Plan 
awards, vested shares (net of tax) should be 
retained by the individual until the required 
shareholding level is reached.
The chart to the top left sets out the 
percentage of base salary held in shares by 
each of the Executive Directors as compared 
with the guidelines. The chart also shows 
for other members of the GEC and senior 
employees who have been in position for five 
years or more the average actual shareholding 
as a percentage of base salary.
Components of remuneration
The table on page 61 summarises the 
components of reward for Executive Directors 
and other members of the GEC. 
The current remuneration package for 
Executive Directors comprises fixed and variable 
components. The variable components are the 
incentive arrangements referred to above and the 
fixed components are base salary and benefits, 
(including pension entitlements). In addition, as 
UK employees, the Executive Directors are eligible 
to participate in the Company's UK all-employee 
share plans.
The average proportion of total remuneration 
that was performance-related in 2010 is 
illustrated by the chart shown on the left. 
This shows that the proportion of each 
Executive Director's total remuneration that 
is performance-related, is significant at target 
performance. For stretch performance, the 
proportion of total remuneration that is 
performance-related is higher still. In 
estimating the relative contribution of those 
elements of remuneration that are, and those 
that are not, performance-related as required by 
the Regulations, a number of assumptions have 
had to be made about the Company's share price 
growth, and TSR relative to the weighted index, 
over the next three years.
 
Senior executives below the Executive Directors
The policy and practice with regard to the 
remuneration of senior employees below the 
Executive Directors who are members of the 
GEC is consistent with that for the Executive 
Directors. These senior executives all have a 
significant portion of their reward package 
linked to performance. They all qualify for AIS, 
and are eligible for awards (other than Group 
Share Awards) under the LTIP, and their 
financial targets are the same as, or cascaded 
from, the targets for the Executive Directors. 
The Committee reviews and approves the 
individual remuneration packages for the 
GEC members and the Company Secretary 
in accordance with the overriding objectives 
of the Group's remuneration policy. Their 
individual performance is reviewed and any 
increase in their base salary, AIS payments, and 
any LTIP awards are subject to approval by the 
Committee each year. 
Other senior employees below GEC level 
are generally treated consistently with the 
Executive Directors and members of the GEC, 
with the exception that they may participate 
in local discretionary plans, and are eligible to 
receive Group Share Awards under the LTIP 
(in addition to Performance Share Awards 
and grants of Market Value Options) but are 
still subject to the overall limits on levels of 
individual award under the LTIP.
Executive Directors' base salaries
Executive Directors' salaries are reviewed each 
year, with any changes normally taking effect 
from 1 April. This review takes into account 
market competitiveness, individual 
performance and experience. Pensionable 
salary is derived from base salary only. In line 
with BG Group's remuneration policy, the 
Committee benchmarks Executive Directors' 
salaries against a comparator group, which, 
for the 2010 salary review, was the FTSE 30 
excluding financial services companies. 
Executive Director salaries are between 
the median and upper quartile for this 
comparator group. The Committee believes 
this positioning is appropriate given the higher 
total reward levels at other international gas 
and oil companies with which BG Group 
competes for talent. 
The Committee has regard to reward levels 
and practices in BG Group's own operations 
when determining remuneration levels for 
Executive Directors. In determining the annual 
base salary increases which apply from 1 April, 
the Committee also considers the range of 
salary increases applying across the Group.  
The base salary increases for the Executive 
Directors which took effect from 1 April 2010 
are summarised in the table to the left. The 
salary increases awarded to the Executive 
Directors were below the average percentage 
base salary increases awarded across the Group.

the market in which the individual 
is employed.
Core benefits typically include pension 
(or cash alternative), life assurance, 
annual leave and medical insurance. 
For UK employees who have joined 
BG Group since April 2007, and for 
employees outside the UK, pension 
benefits typically take the form 
of defined contribution or cash 
alternative arrangements.

prior to April 2007 can continue to 
participate in the defined benefit 
pension arrangement. 
 Reviewed periodically relative to market.
Additional Benefits may vary, in line with 
local market practice. 
These may include company car 
provision, flexible benefit 
arrangements and, in the UK, the 
ability to participate in all-employee 
share plans.
 Reviewed periodically relative to market.
Annual Incentive 
Scheme (AIS)
Cash
Automatic deferral
Voluntary deferral
Designed to focus executives on  
the business priorities for the  
financial year. 
The Deferred Bonus Plan and the 
Voluntary Bonus Deferral Plan (VBDP)
are also designed to provide further 
alignment with shareholder interests.
AIS awards of up to 100% of base 
salary may be paid in cash in full.
AIS awards in excess of 100% of base 
salary are automatically deferred 
under the Deferred Bonus Plan into 
Deferred Bonus Awards over 
BG Group shares.
For the 2010 financial year onwards, 
executives (in common with the 
majority of employees globally) are 
able to choose to defer voluntarily a 
proportion (between 1% and 100%) 
of their AIS award (up to 100% of 
base salary) into a Deferred Share 
Award over BG Group shares granted 
under the VBDP.
 Reviewed periodically to ensure 
performance metrics and scale  
are appropriate.
Deferred Bonus Awards normally 
vest three years after the date of grant. 
In the event that employment ceases 
during the vesting period, Awards 
will normally lapse in full.
Deferred Share Awards granted under 
the VBDP may be exercised in the 
period up to five years from the date  
of grant. Awards do not lapse on 
cessation of employment, other  
than for serious misconduct.
Performance Share 
Awards under the  
Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP) 
Awards over  
BG Group shares
Designed to reward and retain 
executives over the longer term while 
aligning their interests with those 
of BG Group shareholders. 
  Awards are granted over BG Group 
shares. Level of vesting is dependent 
on BG Group's TSR performance 
relative to that of a weighted peer 
group index over the three-year 
performance period from grant.
 Awards are discretionary.
Awards do not normally vest until the 
third anniversary of the date of grant.
 If employment ceases during the 
three-year vesting period, awards 
will normally lapse in full. Annual Incentive Scheme - organisational

Long-Term Incentive Plan 
The LTIP has operated since its introduction 
in May 2008.
The LTIP is designed to reward and retain 
executives over the longer term while also 
aligning their interests with those of BG Group 
shareholders.
The LTIP allows for various types of awards 
to be made, namely, Group Share Awards, 
Performance Share Awards and Market 
Value Options.
When making the decision on the level of 
award, the Committee takes into consideration 
a number of factors including face value, 
estimated present value (EPV) and plan 
dilution limits.
For the Executive Directors, the performance 
measures for the 2010 incentive year were 
Earnings per Share (EPS)
(b) 
(and in the case of 
the Executive Vice President and Managing 
Director, Americas and Global LNG regional 
profit before interest and tax (PBIT)
(b)(c)
), return 
on average capital employed (ROACE)
(d)
 for the 
Group (and in the case of the Executive Vice 
President and Managing Director, Americas 
and Global LNG regional ROACE
(d)(e)
), 
performance against a health, safety, security 
and environment (HSSE) balanced scorecard
(f)
 
(and in the case of the Executive Vice President 
and Managing Director, Americas and Global 
LNG regional health, safety and environment 
performance) and achievements against 
the individual's personal scorecard. During 2011 
the Committee will review the performance 
measures used in the AIS. Any changes arising 
as a result of this review will apply to future 
financial years, and will be reported in the 
Group's 2011 Remuneration report.
In determining the actual incentive payment, 
the Committee follows a three-stage process. 
Firstly, performance against the financial and 
HSSE targets is assessed. Secondly, these 
results are reviewed in the context of the 
underlying performance of the business, 
taking into consideration such factors as 
operational performance, strategy and 
business development activities, and 
performance against industry peers. Thirdly, 
the Committee considers the performance 
of the individual against their objectives. 
For the 2010 incentive year, financial 
performance against both the Group EPS 
and ROACE targets was ahead of stretch, 
and the HSSE balanced scorecard was between 
target and stretch. Taking into account these 
results and overall business and individual 
performance, the Committee has awarded 
the Chief Executive an AIS award of 147% of 
base salary; the Chief Financial Officer
(g)
 an 
AIS award of 116% of base salary and the 
Executive Vice President & Managing Director, 
Americas and Global LNG an AIS award of 116% 
of base salary. 
Cash and share awards will be made in 
March 2011.
Annual Incentive Scheme
In 2010, the AIS provided an incentive 
opportunity in the range of 0% to 200% 
of base salary for members of the GEC.  
The Committee adopts performance  
measures including health, safety and 
environmental indicators. Together these  
form the performance criteria against which  
the Committee can assess how effectively key 
business risks are managed during the year. The 
maximum annual incentive opportunity for the 
Chief Executive was 200% of salary and for the 
other Executive Directors was 150% of salary.  
The same parameters will apply for 2011.
During 2010, BG Group introduced the VBDP 
in a number of countries. All employees 
participating in the AIS arrangements 
(including members of the GEC
(a)
) in these 
countries are eligible to participate in the 
VBDP. Eligible employees may choose to defer 
any percentage (between 1% and 100%) of their 
AIS award (up to 100% of base salary) into a 
Deferred Share Award over BG Group shares. 
This Award may be exercised within five years 
of the date of grant. The balance of the AIS 
award (up to 100% of base salary) is paid in cash.
AIS amounts in excess of 100% of base salary 
are automatically deferred into Deferred 
Bonus Awards over BG Group shares (under 
the Deferred Bonus Plan). Shares subject to 
these Awards are not normally released to 
the individual for three years and are subject to 
forfeiture in the event of leaving employment 
(other than for reason of ill health, agreed 
retirement, redundancy or a change of control). 
Under the Deferred Bonus Plan, the number of 
shares actually delivered may be reduced in 
circumstances where the Company becomes 
aware of misconduct or performance issues 
relevant to the bonus award year.
At the start of the incentive year (1 January), 
the Board sets challenging budget and 
stretch financial performance targets and 
the Committee adopts other performance 
measures with respect to health, safety 
and environmental indicators. Bonuses at 
the higher end of the range are payable 
only for demonstrably superior Group 
and individual performance.
(a)  Eligible employees, other than members of the GEC, who 
participate in the VBDP are able to benefit from a 10% 
uplift on the proportion deferred, provided they hold their 
deferred award for at least three years. Members of the 
GEC are not eligible for this uplift.
(b)  Actual Business performance results are adjusted to exclude 
the effects of changes in upstream prices, material exchange 
rates, contracted Liquefied Natural Gas prices and the 
Comg s regulatory current account. 
(c)  For the Executive Vice President & Managing Director, 
Americas and Global LNG, EPS and regional PBIT are given 
equal weighting.
(d)  Average capital employed consists of total equity excluding 
commodity financial instruments (including, in the case of 
Group ROACE, associated deferred tax) and net borrowings/
funds, averaged between the start and the end of the year. 
Average capital employed is adjusted to exclude the effects 
of changes in upstream prices and material exchange rates. 
Group ROACE represents Business performance* profit after 
tax excluding net finance income/costs on net borrowings/
funds, adjusted as in (b), as a percentage of average capital 
employed. Regional ROACE is measured in a similar way to 
Group ROACE except that returns are measured before tax. 
The adjustments in (b) and (d) are independently reviewed.
(e)  For the Executive Vice President & Managing Director, 
Americas and Global LNG, Group ROACE and regional  
ROACE are given equal weighting.

TSR performance for the Performance Share 
Awards is measured over a three-year 
performance period commencing on the first 
day of the calendar month in which the award 
is made. There is no retest provision. The level 
of Performance Share Awards vesting is related 
to the Company's TSR performance over this 
period relative to a weighted index of a 
selection of industry peers. The constituents 
of the Index for both the September 2010 
and 2009 awards were: 
   Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
   Apache Corporation
   BP plc
   Chevron Corporation
   ConocoPhillips
   Devon Energy Corporation
   ENI S.p.A.
   EOG Resources, Inc.
   Exxon Mobil Corporation
   Hess Corporation
   Marathon Oil Corporation
   Repsol YPF S.A.
   Royal Dutch Shell plc
   Statoil ASA
   Suncor Energy Inc.
   Talisman Energy Inc.
   Total S.A.
   Woodside Petroleum Ltd.
Of these companies, nine are headquartered 
in the USA, one in Australia, two in Canada, 
one in the UK and five elsewhere in Europe.
The constituents of the Index for the 
September 2008 awards were identical to 
those listed above, except that Suncor 
Energy Inc. was not an Index constituent and 
Petro-Canada was included in the Index up 
to the date of the completion of its acquisition 
by Suncor Energy Inc. in August 2009.
The vesting levels of the Performance Share 
Awards are illustrated in the graph above.
The face value of an award is equal to the 
number of shares, or shares under option, 
multiplied by the relevant share price. For 
awards made under the LTIP in 2010, the 
relevant share price was the average share 
price for the five dealing days immediately 
prior to the date of award. A face value limit 
of six times salary applies to each award 
which is also subject to the constraint that 
all awards must not exceed the EPV limit 
described below.
EPV is a measure that describes the economic 
or fair value of an award. The measure takes 
account of the performance conditions and the 
risk that grants and allocations may be forfeited. 
EPV is calculated independently by Kepler 
Associates. For 2010, the EPV of a Performance 
Share Award was calculated as 42%, and of a 
Group Share Award as 86%, of the market value 
of the underlying share. The overriding EPV limit 
that applied to awards made under the LTIP 
(other than in exceptional circumstances 
such as recruitment
(h)
) was 300% of salary. 
The maximum EPV that was awarded in 2010 
(other than in exceptional circumstances such 
as recruitment
(i)
) was 252%.
Performance Share Awards
A limited number of key employees are 
granted Performance Share Awards under 
the LTIP.
For the annual LTIP award made in 
September 2010, Executive Directors and 
members of the GEC were only granted 
Performance Share Awards. 
Performance Share Awards will normally vest 
three years after the date of grant. The vesting 
is conditional on:
   continued employment; 
   the individual employee's performance not 
having fallen significantly below that expected 
since the date of grant; and
   the Company's TSR performance over 
a three-year performance period. This is 
detailed further below. 
There is a further overriding condition that 
the Committee must be satisfied that the 
underlying performance of the Group justifies 
the level of vesting. 
If BG Group's TSR performance is less than the 
Index TSR performance over the performance 
period, the Performance Share Award will lapse.
If BG Group's TSR performance meets the 
Index TSR performance over the performance 
period, 25% of the Performance Share Award 
will vest.
If BG Group's TSR performance exceeds the 
Index TSR performance over the performance 
period by 7% p.a. or more, 100% of the 
Performance Share Award will vest. Between 
these two points the percentage vesting will 
be on a linear sliding scale.
The TSR performance calculation is 
multiplicative, that is, if the Index grows from 
100% to 110%, then BG Group is required to 
move from 100% to 134.75% (i.e. 110% x 107%
3
) 
over three years to achieve maximum vesting.
In the event of a change of control, vesting 
of Performance Share Awards under the LTIP 
is not automatic and would depend on the 
extent to which performance conditions 
had been met at that time. Time pro-rating 
will apply if the Committee considers it 
appropriate given the circumstances of the 
change of control.
(f)  The HSSE balanced scorecard measures performance across 
a range of leading and lagging indicators reflecting the 
Group's commitment to HSSE and is designed to ensure 
HSSE performance is explicitly considered within the 
incentive framework (and in the case of the Executive Vice 
President and Managing Director, Americas and Global LNG 
regional health, safety and environment performance.)
(g)  The Chief Financial Officer also performed the role of 
Managing Director, Europe and Central Asia from November 
2009 to 31 July 2010. In view of the interim nature of this role, 
the Committee considered it appropriate that no change 
should be made to the performance metrics detailed above 
for the Chief Financial Officer for the 2010 incentive year.
(h)  As set out in the summary of key features of the LTIP 
(section 5) in the 2008 AGM circular.
(i)  An exceptional award under the LTIP (with an EPV of 84% of 
base salary) was made in connection with the recruitment of 
Christopher Finlayson, Executive Vice President & Managing 
Director, Europe and Central Asia, who joined BG Group on 
1 August 2010. The award was granted in September 2010.

and, accordingly, these shares were 
transferred to the participating employees 
on 7 September 2010.
For the 2007 allocation, the comparator 
group comprised BG Group and the following 
15 companies:
   Amerada Hess Corporation
   Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
   BP plc
   Chevron Corporation
   ConocoPhillips 
   Duke Energy Corporation
   El Paso Corporation

Company Share Option Scheme (CSOS)
The option price was based on the market 
value at the date of grant. Options could not 
be exercised until three years from the date of 
grant subject to both continued employment 
and achievement of a financial performance 
condition. This performance condition 
determined if, and the extent to which, 
options may be exercised. It was based on 
BG Group's EPS
(a)
 growth relative to the growth 
in the RPIX over a three-year performance 
period. The calculation of EPS growth for 
grants made on or after 21 July 2004 was made 
using constant commodity prices and constant 
exchange rates. No retest was permitted. 
Subject to the above conditions, options may 
be exercised (in whole or in part) at any time 
up to the expiry of 10 years from the date 
of grant.
% EPS growth over RPIX 
(over 3 years)
% of options that  
are exercisable
30 or greater 100
15 50
Less than 15 Options lapsed
A proportion of between half and all of the 
options would have been exercisable if the 
Company achieved EPS growth over three 
years of RPIX plus between 15% and 30%, 
respectively.
For the 2007 CSOS grant, the Company's EPS 
growth for the three-year performance period 
which ended in September 2010, was 22.3% 
above RPIX in the same period. As a result, 
74.33% of the options granted to employees in 
September 2007 vested in September 2010 and 
may be exercised at any time prior to September 
2017. The unvested portion of the CSOS options 
granted in September 2007 lapsed.
All-employee share plans
In order to encourage share ownership, the 
Company currently provides two all-employee 
UK HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) approved 
share plans for its UK employees.
Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
Two elements of the SIP operated during 2010, 
the Partnership Shares Plan and the Flex 
Shares Plan.
(a) Partnership Shares
Eligible employees are offered the opportunity 
to buy Company shares from pre-tax earnings 
as part of a regular share purchase plan. Shares 
are currently purchased every six months using 
employees' accumulated deductions and are 
placed in trust.
At 31 December 2010, 72.1% (31 December 2009 
73.0%) of eligible employees were participating 
in this plan. Of those participating, 81.7% 
(31 December 2009 81.0%) were contributing 
the maximum of  125 per month.
(b) Flex Shares
Flex Share allocations were made to all eligible 
employees as part of the UK flexible benefits 
plan. Flex Share Awards of up to a maximum of 
256 shares, representing the maximum value 
allowed within the  3 000 statutory limit, 
were made on 12 April 2010 to all eligible 
employees in the UK who accepted their 
allocation. Shares are held in trust for up to 
five years.
Group Share Awards
Group Share Awards are granted to certain 
employees below GEC level. Eligibility to be 
considered for an award varies by jurisdiction. 
Group Share Awards will normally vest three 
years after the date of grant, subject to:
   continued employment; and
   the individual employee's performance not 
having fallen significantly below that expected 
since the date of grant.
In the event of a change of control, the level 
of vesting of Group Share Awards under the 
LTIP may be subject to time pro-rating if the 
Committee considers it appropriate given 
the circumstances of the change of control.
No Market Value Options were granted in 2010.
Prior to 2008, the Executive Directors and 
other employees participated in the Long-Term 
Incentive Scheme (LTIS) and Company Share 
Option Scheme (CSOS). No further awards can 
be made under these plans.
Long-Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS)
Vesting of LTIS awards was conditional on 
the Company's TSR performance relative to 
a comparator group of industry peers over 
a three-year period from the date of grant. 
The proportion of the LTIS award that vested 
was dependent on BG Group's position in this 
comparator group. No retest was permitted.
The following performance conditions applied 
for awards made under the LTIS:
BG Group's TSR position 
in comparator group
% of allocated  
shares transferred
First 100
Upper quartile 75
Median 30
Below median
All allocated shares were 
forfeited
Where performance was between upper 
quartile and first position or between median 
and upper quartile, the percentage of shares 
to be transferred was determined on a 
proportionate basis.
The performance period for the 2007 
allocation ended on 3 September 2010. 
BG Group's final TSR for this period relative 
to the TSR of companies in the relevant 
comparator group was measured by the 
independent TSR monitoring service of 
Alithos Limited and reviewed by Kepler 
Associates. This analysis placed the Company 
in third position. The Committee therefore 
decided, in accordance with the performance 
condition for the 2007 allocation, that 86.7% 
of the original award of shares should vest

Sharesave Plan
Grants were made under the BG Group 
Sharesave Scheme up to and including 2007. 
From 2008, grants have been made under the 
Sharesave Plan 2008. The plan enables eligible 
employees to acquire the Company's shares 
with the proceeds of a monthly savings 
contract. The contract period is three years. 
At 31 December 2010, 80% of eligible 
employees were participating in either the 
Sharesave Plan 2008 or its predecessor, the 
Sharesave Scheme, contributing an average 
monthly payment of  228.65. Of those 
participating, 82.7% were contributing the 
statutory maximum of  250 per month.
Pensions
The pension arrangements for Executive 
Directors are detailed on page 69.
As detailed in note 27, page 125, BG Group 
operates a number of pension plans across the 
Group. Outside the UK, these plans are generally 
defined contribution (or money purchase) 
arrangements. In April 2007, a defined 
contribution plan was introduced in the UK 
for new hires. Employees who were already 
members of the defined benefit scheme 
continue to accrue benefits in that scheme. UK 
employees who joined BG Group prior to April 
2007 can continue to participate in the defined 
benefit pension scheme. 
Dilution
The ABI has published guidelines relating to 
the disclosure of commitments to issue new 
shares or re-issue treasury shares under a 
company's share-based schemes. In the event 
that all options and awards outstanding as at 
31 December 2010 under BG Group's LTIP 
(under which awards are planned to be 
satisfied by the re-issue of treasury shares or 
by the issue of new shares) vesting, and all 
CSOS options being exercised (under which 
options are currently satisfied by the issue 
of new shares), the resulting issue of new 
shares and re-issue of treasury shares would 
amount to 1.02% of the issued ordinary share 
capital (excluding treasury shares) at that date.
The exercise of options under BG Group's 
Sharesave Plan 2008 and Sharesave Scheme  
is satisfied by the issue of new shares. If the 
total number of options outstanding under 
these plans as at 31 December 2010 had been 
exercised on that date, the resultant issue of 
shares would have represented 0.07% of the 
total ordinary share capital (excluding treasury 
shares) then in issue.
Partnership and Flex Share awards made 
under the SIP during 2010 were satisfied by 
the re-issue of Treasury shares. These awards 
represented 0.014% of the issued ordinary 
share capital as at 31 December 2010.
The Company's intention is to continue to 
satisfy the future exercise of options and 
vesting of awards under the above share plans 
by the issue of new shares and re-issue of 
Treasury shares as described above.
Service contracts
The Executive Directors' service contracts, 
including arrangements for early termination, 
are carefully considered by the Committee and 
are designed to recruit, retain and motivate 
directors of the quality required to manage  
the Company. The Committee considers that 
a rolling contract with a notice period of one 
year is appropriate.
In line with the Company's policy, the 
Executive Directors' service contracts contain 
change of control provisions. Should the 
Directors' employment be terminated within 
12 months of a change of control, they are 
entitled to liquidated damages. The amount of 
liquidated damages is equal to one year's gross 
salary and a credit of one year's pensionable 
service (less any deductions the employer 
is required to make), which the Committee 
considers to be a genuine pre-estimate of loss. 
The Committee considers that these provisions 
assist with recruitment and retention and that 
their inclusion is therefore in the best interests 
of shareholders.
Other than change of control, the Executive 
Directors' service contracts do not contain 
provisions for compensation in the event 
of early termination. When calculating 
termination payments, the Committee takes 
into account a variety of factors, including 
individual and Company performance, the 
obligation for the Director to mitigate his or 
her own loss (for example, by gaining new 
employment) and the Director's length of 
service. Further details of the Executive 
Directors' service contracts can be found 
on page 70. www.bg-group.com BG Group

(a)  Taxable benefits include items such as company car, driver, financial advice and medical insurance. In addition, in connection with his expatriate assignment in the USA, Martin Houston receives assistance in 
connection with the costs associated with maintaining a base in the USA.
(b)  Bonus figures for 2009 represent amounts payable in cash under the AIS in respect of the 2009 incentive year which were paid in March 2010. Bonus figures for 2010 represent amounts due under the AIS for 
the 2010 incentive year which Executive Directors may receive in cash. Martin Houston elected to voluntarily defer all of his AIS up to 100% of base salary under the Voluntary Bonus Deferral Plan. Accordingly 
the amount of  535 000 will be delivered to him in March 2011 as an award over shares in BG Group under that plan.
(c)  The Deferred Bonus figures represent the bonus amounts in excess of 100% of base salary which are automatically deferred into awards over BG Group shares. Amounts for 2010 represent the face value of 
shares over which awards which will be granted in March 2011, and those for 2009, the value of awards which were granted in March 2010. Awards made under the Deferred Bonus Plan will normally vest three 
years after the date of the award, and are subject to forfeiture on cessation of employment and in certain other specified circumstances.
(d)   BG Group operates a flexible benefits plan in which the majority of its UK employees, including the Executive Directors, are eligible to participate. Under the plan, employees receive their SIP Flex Share 
allocations (the maximum allocation was  2 996 in 2010 ( 2 988 in 2009)) and can also acquire certain additional benefits (generally by salary sacrifice) or decline certain existing benefits. The reported salary 
figures for the Executive Directors reflect the Flex Share allocation and any adjustments that may arise as a result of the operation of this plan. In 2011, the Executive Directors will also be eligible to receive up to 
 3 000 of shares under the Flex Share Plan.
(e)  Salary figures include a cash allowance in lieu of a company car for Frank Chapman and Ashley Almanza.
(f)  William Friedrich retired as a Director on 13 December 2007. William Friedrich continues to be covered by long-term care insurance. The long-term care insurance is being paid by ten instalments, the first of 
which was paid in 2002. The instalments will cease in 2012 and over the next two years the expectation is that the instalments will remain at a similar level. William Friedrich's 2009 taxable benefits include 
certain contractual expenses payable in connection with his relocation back to the USA following his retirement.

(a)  Executive Directors only received grants of Performance Share Awards. All Performance Share Awards granted to UK employees in September 2010 and September 2009 were granted in 
the form of nil-cost options. Under normal circumstances, the awards will not vest and the options will not become exercisable until after the end of the three-year vesting period which 
began on the date of grant of the awards. The options are exercisable until the seventh anniversary of the vesting date but will vest automatically on an employee leaving the Company if not 
already exercised. The level of vesting is dependent on the achievement of specified performance criteria at the end of the three-year performance period. The performance conditions for the 
2010 and 2009 awards are set out on page 63.
(b)  The transfer of shares subject to the September 2008 awards is dependent on the achievement of performance criteria at the end of the three-year performance period. The performance conditions

Executive Directors' interests in ordinary shares
The Executive Directors' interests in ordinary shares of the Company at the start and end of the financial year were as follows:
Interests in ordinary shares
(a)
As at 
1 Jan 2010
As at 
31 Dec 2010 
Ashley Almanza 540 638 476 012
Frank Chapman 1 721 107 1 909 430
Martin Houston 678 119 786 351
(a)  Interests including shares acquired pursuant to the BG Group SIP .
As of 11 March 2011, the Directors' interests in the ordinary share capital of the Company represent less than 1% of the issued ordinary share capital 
of the Company.
As at 31 December 2010, the Executive Directors also had a deemed beneficial interest in 173 443 shares as potential beneficiaries in the BG Group 
plc Employees Share Trust (173 029 shares) and the BG Group New Employee Share Trust (414 shares). As of 11 March 2011, this interest had reduced 
to 155 174 shares, comprising 154 760 shares in the BG Group plc Employees Share Trust and 414 shares in the BG Group New Employees Share Trust.
Pensions
The basis on which retirement benefits are calculated for each of the Executive Directors has not changed during the year. Ashley Almanza and 
Frank Chapman receive an accrual of benefits designed to target a pension of two-thirds of their final 12 months' salary on retirement from 
BG Group at age 60. Martin Houston accrues pension at the rate of 1/60 of his final 12 months' salary for each year of pensionable service. 
As is the case for all other UK employees who became pension scheme members before 6 April 2006, none of the Directors can be paid an 
immediate pension before age 60 on a non-actuarially reduced basis unless they have attained age 55 and completed ten years' service with the 
Group (including pensionable service transferred from previous employment) and the Company expressly agrees to payment on an unreduced basis, 
or they are over the age of 50 and have been made redundant, or in the event of incapacity. UK employees who became pension scheme members 
on or after 6 April 2006 cannot be paid a non-actuarially reduced pension until age 60, other than in the event of incapacity. Pensions in payment 
are increased in line with retail price inflation. An adult dependant's pension is payable on death in service, equal to two-thirds of that payable to 
the pension scheme member based on potential service to age 65. On death in retirement, an adult dependant's pension is payable equal to 
two-thirds of the member's pension prior to exchanging any of it for a cash lump sum. 
The Executive Directors were members of the BG Pension Scheme (BGPS) and the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme (BGSBS) throughout the year. 
The BGPS is a funded, registered pension scheme and the BGSBS is an unfunded, unregistered pension scheme. Frank Chapman and Martin 
Houston elected  enhanced protection' with effect from 6 April 2006, which limits the benefits provided by the BGPS. Ashley Almanza's BGPS 
benefits are limited to the  lifetime allowance'. 
A provision has been made in the Company's accounts in respect of the obligations for unfunded post-retirement benefits. 
Executive Directors' pension provisions were as follows:

a corresponding amount. 
(b)  Actual increase. 
(c)  Increase net of price inflation of 0% (the Revaluation Order for 2010). 
(d)   The transfer values shown at the end of 2009 and 2010 represent the value of each Executive Director's accrued pension based on total service completed to the relevant date. The accrued 
pensions are the amounts to which the Executive Directors would have been entitled had they left service at the relevant date. The transfer values are calculated in accordance with the 
requirements of The Occupational Pension Scheme (Transfer Values) (Amendment) Regulations 2008.  www.bg-group.com BG Group

External appointments
None of the Executive Directors currently holds an appointment as a non-executive director of another company.
Change of control
As described on page 65, the Executive Directors' service contracts contain change of control provisions.
For the purposes of these provisions, a change of control is deemed to occur if the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company; or if 50% 
or more of the voting rights of the Company or the right to appoint or remove the majority of the Board of the Company become vested in any 
individual or body or group of individuals or bodies acting in concert; or if all or substantially all of the business, assets and undertakings of the 
Company become owned by any person, firm or company (other than a subsidiary or associated company). A change of control is also deemed 
to occur if the whole of the issued capital of BG Energy Holdings Limited or a substantial part of the undertaking of that Company (including its 
subsidiaries) is transferred to another company, unless that transferee company is a subsidiary of the Company, or a company ultimately owned 
by substantially the same shareholders as are the ultimate owners of the Company.
However, a change of control does not occur if (and only if) through a process of reconstruction the Company becomes a subsidiary of another 
company owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the shareholders of the Company. The Executive Directors' service contracts provide 
that any payments made pursuant to these provisions will be made, less any deductions the employer is required to make. Any such payments shall 
be in full and final settlement of any claims the Executive Director may have against the employer or any associated company arising out of the 
termination of employment, except for any personal injury claim, any claim in respect of accrued pension rights, or statutory employment 
protection claims.
Non-Executive Directors 
The Board aims to recruit Non-Executive Directors of a high calibre, with broad commercial, international or other relevant experience. Non-Executive 
Directors are appointed by the Board on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee. Their appointment is for an initial term of three 
years, subject to election by shareholders at the first annual general meeting following their appointment and annual re-election thereafter. 
The terms of engagement of the Non-Executive Directors are set out in a letter of appointment.
The basic annual fee paid to Non-Executive Directors increased from  75 000 to  77 500 on 1 July 2010. Additional fees are also payable, for example, 
for membership of, or chairing, a Committee of the Board and acting as Senior Independent Director. The current remuneration policy for 
Non-Executive Directors requires that fees are reviewed every two years, taking into account time commitment, competition for high-quality 
non-executive directors and market movements. 
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Company's share schemes, incentive schemes or pension schemes.
To facilitate the alignment of the interests of the Non-Executive Directors with those of shareholders, the Group has put in place a Non-Executive 
Directors' share purchase programme through which Non-Executive Directors may elect to invest a proportion of their fees, net of tax and on a 
regular basis, to acquire BG Group shares on the open market. The first deductions were made under this programme in January 2010.
Chairman
Sir Robert Wilson was initially appointed as Chairman with effect from 1 January 2004. He was first re-appointed for a three-year term with effect 
from 1 January 2007 and following due consideration was re-appointed with effect from 1 January 2010, at which point his fee was increased to 
 700 000 per annum. In line with the Non-Executive Directors, Sir Robert Wilson's re-appointment is for a three-year term, subject to annual 
re-election by shareholders at the annual general meeting, and there is no notice period and no provision for payment in the event of early 
termination. Sir Robert Wilson's fee was raised with effect from 1 January 2011 to  725 000 and is next subject to review on 1 January 2012.
