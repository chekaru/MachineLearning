 (a)  TSR is defined as the return on investment obtained 
from holding a company's shares over a period. It includes 
dividends paid, the change in the capital value of the
shares and other payments to or by shareholders within  
the period. TSR is calculated on a common currency basis  
to ensure that international comparisons are fair.

policy, reward components and emphasis  
on performance-related reward continue to 
be appropriate. However, it will keep these 
under review.
During 2011, the Committee reviewed the 
performance-related elements of reward, 
the Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS) and the 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), to ensure 
they continue to support the Group's 
strategic objectives.
The Committee concluded that changes were 
required to the AIS. The process has been 
simplified to a two-stage process. Business 
and individual performance will be assessed 
at stage one, the results of which will then be 
reviewed in the context of the overall business 
performance. For all Executive Directors, 
business performance will be measured using 
the same Group-wide metrics. In addition 
to financial and HSSE measures, focus will be 
on the progress of BG Group's largest capital 
projects. The revised framework will apply for the 
2012 AIS. No other changes have been made.
In connection with its review of the LTIP, 
the Committee concluded that the current 
index-based total shareholder return (TSR)
(a)
 
measure (combined with the requirement 
that the Committee must be satisfied that 
the underlying performance of the Group justifies 
the level of vesting) continues to be appropriate. 
Further details of the AIS and the LTIP are 
set out in the body of this report.
Executive remuneration was the subject of 
extensive UK Government consultation during 
the latter half of 2011. The Committee has 
noted the outline proposals issued by the 
Business Secretary to the UK Government 
in January 2012. It will continue to monitor and 
take appropriate account of developments 
in this area during 2012.
The Remuneration Committee is focused on ensuring 
BG Group's remuneration policy is aligned with 
shareholders' interests and enables it to attract,  
retain and motivate executive talent.
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present 
the Directors' report on remuneration for 2011, 
for which we will be seeking approval from 
shareholders at our AGM.
The Committee believes it is essential that 
BG Group's remuneration policy is clearly 
aligned with the interests of shareholders.  
The Committee's focus is on continuing to 
ensure BG Group's remuneration policy and 
components of reward are appropriately 
positioned in the market to enable it to  
attract, retain and motivate the executive 
talent required for delivery of its long-term 
business strategy.
The market in which BG Group operates and 
competes for talent is global. The Committee

Summary of BG Group's remuneration policy for Executive Directors and other members of the 
Group Executive Committee:
Shareholder-aligned   The performance-related incentive arrangements are designed to align 
the interests of executives with those of shareholders and establish 
a clear link between sustained individual and corporate performance.
   BG Group's shareholding guidelines encourage Executive Directors, 
GEC members and certain other senior employees to build 
up (over a period of five years from appointment) and retain 
a minimum holding of shares.
Performance-related   At the Executive Director and senior manager levels, the majority of the 
reward opportunity is provided through performance-related incentives.
   Reward under these incentives is linked to both individual and BG Group's 
performance. When setting targets and assessing performance, 
appropriate account is taken of business risk and the delivery of 
sustained returns to shareholders.
   Bonus amounts in excess of 100% of salary are automatically deferred 
in shares for a period of three years, and long-term incentive vesting 
is subject to BG Group's three-year TSR
 
performance. Long-term holding of 
vested shares is further encouraged by BG Group's shareholding guidelines.
Market competitive 
and aligned with 
Governance Code
   It is designed to deliver reward that will facilitate the recruitment, 
retention and motivation of the executive talent necessary to deliver 
successfully BG Group's growth strategy.
   It takes appropriate account of the Governance Code and best 
practice guidelines published by regulators and institutional 
shareholder bodies.
The Company Secretary attended meetings 
as Secretary to the Committee. The Company 
Secretary was Keith Hubber until 13 May 2011, 
and subsequently is Steve Allen.
The following individuals attended meetings by 
invitation and provided advice to the Committee 
to enable it to make informed decisions:
   Sir Frank Chapman, Chief Executive; 
   Robert Booker, Executive Vice President, 
Human Resources; and
   Jane Kellett, Head of Reward.
No individual was present when their own 
remuneration was being discussed.
The Committee also meets without management 
present and receives information and 
independent executive remuneration advice 
from Kepler Associates
(a)
, an external consultancy 
appointed by the Committee. During 2011, Kepler 
Associates provided advice to the Committee 
on market trends, incentive schemes and other 
remuneration issues. Kepler Associates does 
not advise the Group on any other issues.
Other external advisers also provided 
support and advice in relation to executive 
remuneration to the Committee. Linklaters LLP
(a)
 
provided legal advice on employee incentives 
of the BG Pension Scheme, as well as other 
general consultancy services to the Group. 
These advisers are appointed by management 
or the relevant Trustees, as appropriate.
Executive Directors
Remuneration policy
In defining BG Group's remuneration policy, the 
Committee takes into account advice received 
from external consultants and also best practice 
guidelines set by regulators and institutional 
shareholder bodies, including the principles and 
guidelines on executive remuneration issued 
by the Association of British Insurers (ABI). 
The Committee has also followed the principles 
of Section D of the Governance Code that 
relate to remuneration.
The current intention is that the framework 
of this remuneration policy will apply for 
future years.
To implement this policy, BG Group has 
a well-developed, Group-wide performance 
management system and, during 2011, 
operated two performance-related 
incentive arrangements for executives:
   the Annual Incentive Scheme - designed to 
focus executives on the business priorities 
of the financial year and to reinforce the 
individual and Group performance ethic; and
   the Long-Term Incentive Plan - designed to 
reward and retain executives over the longer 
term while also aligning their interests with 
those of BG Group shareholders. The LTIP 
allows for various types of awards to 
be made (specifically Group Share Awards, 
Performance Share Awards and Market Value 
Options). Executive Directors and members 
of the GEC may only be awarded Performance 
Share Awards and Market Value Options. For 
the annual LTIP awards made in September 
2011, Executive Directors and members 
of the GEC received grants of Performance 
Share Awards only. Performance Share Awards 
aim to motivate participants to maximise 
long-term TSR, as measured against a weighted 
index comprising a selection of sector 
comparators over a period of three years.
The two incentive arrangements complement 
each other and enable the measurement 
and reward of both short and long-term 
performance. In particular, the Committee 
considers that these complementary incentive 
arrangements take appropriate account of 
business risk and align the reward arrangements 
of executives with the delivery of sustained 
returns to shareholders.

for the five-year period ended 31 December 2011 (calculated 
in accordance with the Large & Medium-Sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts & Reports) Regulations 2008 (the 
Regulations)) against the performance of the FTSE 100.
The FTSE 100 was chosen because this is a recognised 
broad equity market index of which BG Group is a member.

relative to its most relevant industry peers, details of which 
are contained on page 73.

Shareholding guidelines
The Committee has adopted guidelines 
for Executive Directors, GEC members and 
certain other senior employees to encourage 
substantial long-term share ownership. These 
specify that, over a period of five years from 
the date of appointment, Executive Directors 
should build up, and then retain, a holding 
of shares with a value equivalent to 200% 
of base salary. The required holding for other 
members of the GEC is 100% of base salary 
and for certain other senior employees is 
50% of base salary. The guidelines require that, 
in relation to Performance Share and Group 
Share Awards under the LTIP and Deferred 
Bonus Plan awards, vested shares (net of tax) 
should be retained by the individual until 
the required shareholding level is reached.
The chart to the top left sets out the 
percentage of base salary held in shares by 
each of the Executive Directors as compared 
with the guidelines. The chart also shows 
for other members of the GEC and senior 
employees the average actual shareholding 
as a percentage of base salary.
Components of remuneration
The table on page 71 summarises the 
components of reward for Executive 
Directors and other members of the GEC.
The current remuneration package for 
Executive Directors comprises fixed and 
variable components. The variable components 
are the incentive arrangements referred to 
above and the fixed components are base salary 
and benefits (including annual pension cost). 
In addition, as UK employees, the Executive 
Directors are eligible to participate in the 
Company's UK all-employee share plans.
The average proportion of the Executive 
Directors' total remuneration that was 
performance-related in 2011 is illustrated by 
the chart shown on the left. This shows that 
the proportion of total remuneration that 
is performance-related is significant at target 
performance. For stretch performance, 
the proportion of total remuneration that is 
performance-related is higher still. In estimating 
the relative contribution of those elements 
of remuneration that are, and those that are 
not, performance-related as required by 
the Regulations, a number of assumptions have 
had to be made about the Company's share 
price growth, and TSR relative to the weighted 
index, over the next three years.
Senior executives below the Executive Directors
The policy and practice with regard to the 
remuneration of senior executives below 
the Executive Directors who are members 
of the GEC are consistent with that for the 
Executive Directors. These senior executives 
all have a significant portion of their reward 
package linked to performance. They all 
qualify for the AIS, and are eligible for awards 
(other than Group Share Awards) under the LTIP , 
and their financial targets are the same as, or 
cascaded from, the targets for the Executive 
Directors. The Committee reviews and approves 
the individual remuneration packages for the 
GEC members and the Company Secretary 
in accordance with the overriding objectives 
of the Group's remuneration policy. Their 
individual performance is reviewed and any 
increase in their base salary, AIS payments 
and any LTIP awards is subject to approval 
by the Committee each year.
Senior employees below GEC level are 
generally treated consistently with 
the Executive Directors and members of 
the GEC, with the exception that they may 
participate in local discretionary plans, and 
are eligible to receive Group Share Awards 
under the LTIP (in addition to Performance 
Share Awards and grants of Market Value 
Options) subject to the overall limits on 
levels of individual award under the LTIP.
Executive Directors' base salaries
Executive Directors'
 
salaries are reviewed 
each year, with any changes normally taking 
effect from 1 April. This review takes into 
account market competitiveness, individual 
performance and experience. Pensionable 
salary is derived from base salary only. In line 
with BG Group's remuneration policy, the 
Committee benchmarks Executive Directors' 
salaries against a comparator group which, 
for the 2011 salary review, was the FTSE 30 
excluding financial services companies. 
Those Executive Director salaries, which were 
reviewed in 2011, are positioned between 
the median and upper quartile for this 
comparator group. The Committee believes 
this positioning is appropriate given 
the higher total reward levels at other 
international gas and oil companies with 
which BG Group competes for talent.
The Committee has regard to reward levels 
and practices in BG Group's own operations 
when determining remuneration levels 
for Executive Directors. In determining the 
annual base salary increases which apply 
from 1 April, the Committee also considers 
the range of salary increases applying across 
the Group. The base salary increases for the 
Executive Directors which took effect from 
1 April 2011 are summarised in the table 
to the left. The percentage salary increases 
awarded to the Executive Directors were 
below the average percentage base salary 
increases awarded across the Group.

those of BG Group shareholders.
Awards are granted over BG Group 
shares. Level of vesting is dependent 
on BG Group's TSR performance 
relative to that of a weighted peer 
group index over the three-year 
performance period from grant.
Awards are discretionary.
Awards do not normally vest until the

the AIS. As a result of this review, certain 
changes have been made to the performance 
measures which will operate for the 2012 
financial year. These are illustrated in the chart 
above. All Executive Directors will be measured 
against challenging budget and stretch targets 
for the same Group-wide metrics. These now 
include a 20% weighting on assessment of 
in-year project performance
(g)
. The weighting 
of these performance measures is illustrated 
in the chart above. These results will then be 
reviewed in the context of the overall performance 
of the business. As a result of these changes, 
the process for determining the annual 
incentive payment has been simplified.
No changes are being made to the AIS incentive 
opportunity range which remains at 0% to 200% 
of base salary, or to the deferral requirements.
prior to 15 November, the Executive Director 
and Managing Director, BG Advance, held 
the position of Executive Vice President and 
Managing Director, Europe and Central Asia. 
Accordingly, the AIS performance metrics for 
their regional Managing Director roles applied 
for 10.5 months and for their new Group roles 
for 1.5 months of 2011. These are set out in the 
charts on the right.
In determining the actual incentive payment, the 
Committee followed a three-stage process. Firstly, 
performance against the financial and HSSE targets 
was assessed. Secondly, these results were reviewed 
in the context of the underlying performance of 
the business, taking into consideration factors 
such as operational performance, strategy and 
business development activities, and performance 
against industry peers. Thirdly, the Committee 
considered the performance of the individual 
against their objectives.
For the 2011 incentive year, the AIS performance 
outcomes were as follows:
Group EPS
(b)
 At stretch
Group ROACE
(d)
 Between target and stretch
Group HSSE
(f)
 Below target
Following consideration of the above (and 
regional profit before interest and tax (PBIT), 
return on average capital employed (ROACE), 
and HSSE outcomes where relevant) together 
with overall business and individual performance, 
the following AIS awards (as % of base salary) 
were agreed for the Executive Directors:
Maximum 
bonus
Actual 
bonus
Chief Executive 200% 138%
Chief Financial Officer 150% 105%
Chief Operating Officer 150% 120%
Managing Director, BG Advance 150% 61%
The relatively lower AIS award for the Managing 
Director, BG Advance is a result of Europe and 
Central Asia regional PBIT and ROACE performance 
being below target.
Cash and share awards will be made in March 2012.
2012 Annual Incentive Scheme
As indicated in the Company's 2010 Remuneration 
report during 2011 the Committee reviewed 
2011 Annual Incentive Scheme
The Committee adopts performance measures 
including health, safety and environmental 
indicators. Together, these form the performance 
criteria against which the Committee can assess 
how effectively key business risks are managed 
during the year. In 2011, the maximum annual 
incentive opportunity for the Chief Executive 
was 200% of salary and for the other Executive 
Directors was 150% of salary.
AIS amounts in excess of 100% of base salary 
are automatically deferred into Deferred 
Bonus Awards over BG Group shares (under 
the Deferred Bonus Plan). Shares subject 
to these Awards are not normally released to 
the individual for three years and are subject 
to forfeiture in the event of leaving employment 
(other than for reasons such as ill health, agreed 
retirement or redundancy). Under the Deferred 
Bonus Plan, the number of shares actually 
delivered may be reduced in circumstances 
where the Company becomes aware of 
misconduct or performance issues relevant 
to the bonus award year.
In 2011, BG Group continued to operate the 
VBDP in a number of countries. All employees 
participating in the AIS arrangements (including 
members of the GEC
(a)
) in these countries 
are eligible to participate in the VBDP. Eligible 
employees may choose to defer any percentage 
(between 1% and 100%) of their AIS award 
(up to 100% of base salary) into a Deferred 
Share Award over BG Group shares. This Award 
may be exercised within five years of the date 
of grant. The balance of the AIS award (up to 
100% of base salary) is paid in cash.
At the start of the incentive year (1 January), 
the Board sets challenging budget and stretch 
financial performance targets and the Committee 
adopts other performance measures with 
respect to health, safety and environmental 
indicators. Bonuses at the higher end of the 
range are payable only for demonstrably 
superior Group and individual performance.
For the Executive Directors, the performance 
measures for the 2011 incentive year are 
summarised in the charts shown on the right. 
Prior to his appointment on 15 November 2011, 
the Chief Operating Officer held the position 
of Executive Vice President and Managing 
Director, Americas and Global LNG. Similarly, 
(a)  Eligible employees, other than members of the GEC, 
who participate in the VBDP are able to benefit from a 10% 
uplift on the proportion deferred, provided they hold their 
deferred award for at least three years. Members of the 
GEC are not eligible for this uplift.
(b)  Actual business performance results are adjusted to 
exclude the effects of changes in upstream prices, material 
exchange rates, contracted LNG prices and the Comg s 
regulatory current account. For a reconciliation between 
business performance and total results, see note 1, page 99 
and note 8, page 110.
(c)  EPS and regional PBIT are given equal weighting.
(d)  Group ROACE is calculated by expressing post-tax business 
performance profit excluding net finance income/costs on net 
borrowings/funds (adjusted as in footnote (b)) as a percentage 
of average Group capital employed. Group average capital 
employed is calculated by aggregating total equity (excluding 
commodity financial instruments and associated deferred 
tax) and net borrowings/funds adjusted to exclude the 
impact of changes in upstream prices and material exchange 
rates and averaging the positions at the start and end of the 
financial year. Regional ROACE is measured in a similar way 
except returns are measured before tax.
(e)  Group ROACE and regional ROACE are given equal weighting.
(f)  The HSSE balanced scorecard measures performance 
across a range of leading and lagging indicators reflecting 
the Group's commitment to HSSE and is designed to 
ensure HSSE performance is explicitly considered within 
the incentive framework.
(g)  In-year project performance will be assessed for all BG Group's 
Board sanctioned projects. This includes projects in which 
BG Group is the operator, or joint operator, together with  
non-operated projects. Particular focus will be given to in-year 
cost and schedule performance relative to that planned.

Performance Share Award 
TSR performance and vesting levels
(%)
Index Index
x107% p.a.
Vesting level % 
Performance Share Awards will normally 
vest three years after the date of grant. 
The vesting is conditional on:
   continued employment;
   the individual employee's performance 
not having fallen significantly below that 
expected since the date of grant; and
   the Company's TSR performance over 
a three-year performance period. 
This is detailed further below. 
There is a further overriding condition that 
the Committee must be satisfied that the 
underlying performance of the Group 
justifies the level of vesting.
TSR performance for the Performance 
Share Awards is measured over a three-year 
performance period commencing on the 
first day of the calendar month in which the 
award is made. There is no retest provision. 
The level of Performance Share Awards vesting 
is related to the Company's TSR performance 
over this period relative to a weighted index 
of a selection of industry peers. The constituents 
of the index are summarised below:

(a)  The potential constituents of the index are reviewed annually 
to ensure they continue to be appropriate. Following the 
review in July 2011 six changes were made as summarised 
in the table above.
(b)  Petro Canada was included in 2008 index until the date of 
completion of its acquisition by Suncor Energy in August 2009.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
The LTIP has operated since its introduction 
in May 2008.
The LTIP is designed to reward and retain executives 
over the longer term while also aligning their 
interests with those of BG Group shareholders.
The LTIP allows for various types of awards to be 
made, namely, Group Share Awards, Performance 
Share Awards and Market Value Options.
When making the decision on the level of award, 
the Committee takes into consideration a number 
of factors including face value, estimated 
present value (EPV) and plan dilution limits.
The face value of an award is equal to the 
number of shares, or shares under option, 
multiplied by the relevant share price. 
For awards made under the LTIP in 2011, the 
relevant share price was the average share price 
for the five dealing days immediately prior to 
the date of award. A face value limit of six times 
salary applies to each award which is also 
subject to the constraint that all awards must 
not exceed the EPV limit described below.
EPV is a measure that describes the economic 
or fair value of an award. The measure takes 
account of the performance conditions 
and the risk that grants and allocations may 
be forfeited. EPV is calculated independently 
by Kepler Associates. For 2011, the EPV of 
a Performance Share Award was calculated 
as 43%, and of a Group Share Award as 86%, 
of the market value of the underlying share. 
LTIP awards granted to an individual in a 
financial year cannot exceed a total EPV of 
300% of base salary (other than in exceptional 
circumstances such as recruitment)
(h)
. The 
maximum EPV of LTIP awards granted to an 
individual in 2011 (other than in exceptional 
circumstances such as recruitment) was 258%.
Performance Share Awards
A limited number of key employees are granted 
Performance Share Awards under the LTIP. 
For the annual LTIP award made in September 
2011, Executive Directors and members of 
the GEC were only granted Performance 
Share Awards.
Of the 2011 index constituents, nine are 
headquartered in the USA, one in Australia, 
four in Canada, one in the UK and five 
elsewhere in Europe.
The vesting levels of the Performance Share 
Awards are illustrated in the graph above 
and the table below.
BG Group's performance 
relative to index TSR 
performance Level of vesting (%)
Less than index 
TSR performance 0%
Meets index TSR performance 25%
Exceeds index TSR performance 
by 7% pa or more 100%
Exceeds index  
TSR performance but  
by less than 7% pa.
Linear sliding scale 
(between 25% and 
100% vesting)
The TSR performance calculation is multiplicative, 
that is, if the index grows from 100% to 110%, 
then BG Group is required to move from 100% 
to 134.75% (i.e. 110% x 107%
3
) over three years 
to achieve maximum vesting.
In the event of a change of control, vesting 
of Performance Share Awards under the 
LTIP is not automatic and would depend on 
the extent to which performance conditions 
had been met at that time. Time pro-rating 
may apply if the Committee considers it 
appropriate given the circumstances of 
the change of control.
The performance period for the 2008 awards 
ended on 31 August 2011. BG Group's TSR 
performance relative to the weighted index 
was measured by the independent TSR 
monitoring service of Alithos Limited and 
reviewed by Kepler Associates. This analysis 
indicated that BG Group had outperformed 
the index by 3.46% p.a. on average, and as a 
result 62% of the shares awarded should vest. 
The Committee considered this together with 
(h)  As set out in the summary of key features of the LTIP 
(section 5) in the 2008 AGM circular. An exceptional award 
under the LTIP (with an EPV of 175% of base salary) was 
granted in March 2011 in connection with the appointment 
of Fabio Barbosa as Chief Financial Officer. This combined 
with the LTIP award made to him in September 2011 resulted 
in aggregate LTIP awards of 350% of base salary in the 
financial year.

Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Sharesave Plan
Grants were made under the BG Group 
Sharesave Scheme up to and including 2007. 
From 2008, grants have been made under the 
Sharesave Plan 2008. The plan enables eligible 
employees to acquire the Company's shares 
with the proceeds of a monthly savings 
contract. The contract period is three years. 
At 31 December 2011, 77.6% of eligible employees 
were participating in either the Sharesave Plan 
2008 or its predecessor, the Sharesave Scheme, 
contributing an average monthly payment 
of  226.87. Of those participating, 82.1% were 
contributing the statutory maximum of 
 250 per month.
Pensions
The pension arrangements for Executive 
Directors are detailed on page 78.
As detailed in note 26, page 130, BG Group 
operates a number of pension plans across 
the Group. Outside the UK, these plans 
are generally defined contribution (or money 
purchase) arrangements. A defined contribution 
plan has operated in the UK since April 2007. 
UK employees who joined BG Group prior 
to April 2007 can continue to participate  
in the defined benefit pension scheme.
Dilution
The Association of British Insurers has 
published guidelines relating to the disclosure 
of commitments to issue new shares or 
re-issue treasury shares under a company's 
share-based schemes. In the event that all 
options and awards outstanding as at  
31 December 2011 under BG Group's LTIP (under 
which awards are planned to be satisfied by 
the re-issue of treasury shares or by the issue 
of new shares) vest, and all CSOS options 
(under which options are currently satisfied 
by the issue of new shares) are exercised, 
the resulting issue of new shares and re-issue 
of treasury shares would amount to 0.92% 
of the issued ordinary share capital (excluding 
treasury shares) at that date.
The exercise of options under BG Group's 
Sharesave Plan 2008 and Sharesave Scheme 
is satisfied by the issue of new shares. If the 
total number of options outstanding under 
these plans as at 31 December 2011 had been 
exercised on that date, the resultant issue 
of shares would have represented 0.05% 
of the total ordinary share capital (excluding 
treasury shares) then in issue.
Partnership and Flex Share awards made 
under the SIP during 2011 were satisfied by 
the re-issue of treasury shares. These awards 
represented 0.01% of the issued ordinary share 
capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 
31 December 2011.
The Company's intention is to continue 
to satisfy the future exercise of options and 
vesting of awards under the above share 
plans by the issue of new shares and re-issue 
of treasury shares as described above. As 
of 31 December 2011, the BG Group Employee 
Share Trust held 1,086,283 shares and the 
BG Group New Employee Share Trust held 
414 shares.
Service contracts
The Executive Directors' service contracts, 
including arrangements for early termination, 
are carefully considered by the Committee 
and are designed to recruit, retain and 
motivate Directors of the quality required 
to manage the Company. The Committee 
considers that a rolling contract with a 
notice period of one year is appropriate.
In line with the Company's policy, the Executive 
Directors' service contracts contain change 
of control provisions. Should the Executive 
Directors' employment be terminated within 
12 months of a change of control, they are 
entitled to liquidated damages. The amount of 
liquidated damages is equal to one year's gross 
salary plus a credit of one year's pensionable 
service for those Executive Directors who 
are members of the defined benefit pension 
scheme (or one year's cash allowance in lieu 
of pension if the Executive Director is not 
accruing any entitlement to post retirement 
benefits) (less any deductions the employer 
is required to make), which the Committee 
considers to be a genuine pre-estimate of loss. 
The Committee considers that these provisions 
assist with recruitment and retention and 
that their inclusion is therefore in the best 
interests of shareholders.
Other than change of control, the Executive 
Directors' service contracts do not contain 
provisions for compensation in the event 
of early termination. When calculating 
termination payments, the Committee takes 
into account a variety of factors, including 
individual and Company performance, 
the obligation for the Director to mitigate 
his or her own loss (for example, by gaining 
new employment) and the Director's length 
of service. Further details of the Executive 
Directors' service contracts can be found 
on page 76.
the underlying financial performance of the 
Group and the individual performance of the 
executives, and concluded 62% of the shares 
awarded to executives would vest. Accordingly 
the awards vested on 2 September 2011.
Group Share Awards
Group Share Awards are granted to certain 
employees below GEC level. Eligibility to be 
considered for an award varies by jurisdiction. 
Group Share Awards will normally vest three 
years after the date of grant, subject to:
   continued employment; and
   the individual employee's performance 
not having fallen significantly below that 
expected since the date of grant.
In the event of a change of control, the level 
of vesting of Group Share Awards under the 
LTIP may be subject to time pro-rating if the 
Committee considers it appropriate given 
the circumstances of the change of control.
No Market Value Options were granted in 2011. 
Prior to 2008, the Executive Directors and other 
employees participated in the Long-Term 
Incentive Scheme (LTIS) and Company Share 
Option Scheme (CSOS). No further awards 
can be made under these plans.
All-employee share plans
In order to encourage share ownership, the 
Company currently provides two all-employee 
UK HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) approved 
share plans for its UK employees.
Share Incentive Plan
Two elements of the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) 
operated during 2011, the Partnership Shares  
Plan and the Flex Shares Plan.
(a) Partnership shares
Eligible employees are offered the opportunity 
to buy Company shares from pre-tax earnings 
as part of a regular share purchase plan. Shares 
are currently purchased every six months using 
employees' accumulated deductions and are 
placed in trust.
At 31 December 2011, 70.2% (31 December 2010 
72.1%) of eligible employees were participating 
in this plan. Of those participating, 82.0% 
(31 December 2010 81.7%) were contributing 
the maximum of  125 per month.
(b) Flex shares
Flex share allocations were made to all eligible 
employees as part of the UK flexible benefits 
plan. Flex Share awards of up to a maximum 
of 191 shares, representing the maximum 
value allowed within the  3 000 statutory limit, 
were made on 7 April 2011 to all eligible employees 
in the UK who accepted their allocation.

(a)  BG Group operates a flexible benefits plan in which the majority of its UK employees, including the Executive Directors, are eligible to participate. Under the plan, employees receive their SIP Flex 
Shares Plan allocations (the maximum allocation was  2 987 in 2011 ( 2 996 in 2010)) and can also acquire certain additional benefits (generally by salary sacrifice) or decline certain existing benefits. 
The reported salary figures for the Executive Directors reflect the Flex Shares allocation and any adjustments that may arise as a result of the operation of this plan. In 2012, the Executive Directors 
will also be eligible to receive up to  3 000 of shares under the Flex Shares Plan. 
(b)  Taxable benefits include items such as company car, driver, financial and legal advice and medical insurance. In addition, in connection with his expatriate assignment in the USA, Martin Houston 
received assistance in connection with the costs associated with performing his role in the USA. Fabio Barbosa's taxable benefits include expenses payable in connection with his relocation to the UK. 
Ashley Almanza's taxable benefits include legal fees in respect of employment and related matters.
(c)  Bonus figures for 2011 and 2010 represent amounts due under the AIS for the 2011 and 2010 incentive years, respectively, in respect of the office of Executive Director and which the Executive Directors 
may receive in cash. Fabio Barbosa and Chris Finlayson elected to voluntarily defer all of their AIS up to 100% of base salary under the VBDP . Accordingly, awards will be made in March 2012 over ordinary 
shares in BG Group under that plan.
(d)  The deferred bonus figures represent the bonus amounts in excess of 100% of base salary which are automatically deferred into awards over BG Group shares. Amounts for 2011 represent the face value 
of shares over which awards will be granted in March 2012, and those for 2010 the value of awards which were granted in March 2011. Awards made under the Deferred Bonus Plan will normally vest 
three years after the date of the award, and are subject to forfeiture on cessation of employment and in certain other specified circumstances. Subject to no issues being identified in relation to conduct 
or performance for the relevant bonus award year, Ashley Almanza's awards will vest in full on cessation of his employment in December 2012.
(e)  Salary figures include a cash allowance in lieu of a company car for Ashley Almanza, Sir Frank Chapman and Fabio Barbosa. Salary figures for Chris Finlayson include a trade-down cash allowance 
in respect of his company car.
(f)  Remuneration figures reported, including those for the bonus and deferred bonus amounts, are in respect of services as an Executive Director. Fabio Barbosa was appointed an Executive Director 
on 31 March 2011, Chris Finlayson was appointed an Executive Director on 15 November 2011 and Ashley Almanza ceased to be an Executive Director from 31 March 2011. Accordingly the remuneration 
figures reported are for the 9-month, 1.5-month and 3-month periods respectively. Ashley Almanza's AIS award for 2011, including a 9-month period when he served as an Executive Vice President  
on the GEC, amounted to 105% of his base salary, resulting in a total AIS award of  745 000 of which a total of  37 000 will be deferred. 
(g) Fabio Barbosa and Chris Finlayson have elected to take a cash allowance of 30% of base salary in lieu of pension contributions.

(a) Or date of appointment if later.
(b) Or period from date of appointment if later.
(c)  Executive Directors only received grants of Performance Share Awards. All Performance Share Awards granted to UK employees from September 2009 were granted in the form of nil-cost options. 
Under normal circumstances, the awards will not vest and the options will not become exercisable until after the end of the three-year vesting period which began on the date of grant of the awards. 
Once vested the options are exercisable until the seventh anniversary of the vesting date but will be automatically exercised on an employee leaving the Company if not already exercised. The level  
of vesting is dependent on the Company's TSR performance over a three-year period relative to a weighted index of a selection of industry peers. The performance conditions for the awards from 2009 
onwards are set out on page 73.
(d)  The transfer of shares subject to the September 2008 awards was dependent on the Company's TSR performance over a three-year period relative to a weighted index of a selection of industry peers, 
see page 73. As a result of the performance criteria measured in August 2011, 62% of the September 2008 award vested, and shares were released to the Executive Directors on 2 September 2011.
(e)  Dividend equivalent shares accrue on all Performance Share Awards throughout the vesting period; 11 261, 4 111, 4 747 dividend equivalent shares were transferred to Sir Frank Chapman, Martin Houston 
and Ashley Almanza, respectively, in connection with the vesting of the 2008 Performance Share Awards.
(f)  Ashley Almanza ceased to be an Executive Director on 31 March 2011. The awards reported are for those granted to him whilst he was an Executive Director. Subject to the satisfaction of performance 
conditions (see page 73) these awards will vest on a time pro-rated basis on the cessation of Ashley Almanza's employment in December 2012. The award balances shown are those held at the date he 
ceased to hold office, which was 31 March 2011.
(g)  On 2 September 2011, Ashley Almanza was granted a Performance Share Award in the form of a nil-cost option under the rules of the LTIP . The vesting of this award is subject to the achievement 
of performance conditions (see page 73). Assuming the performance criteria are met in full this award will vest on a time pro-rated basis when Ashley Almanza's employment ceases. Assuming this 
is no earlier than 18 December 2012, the maximum number of shares that will vest and be transferred to him will be 90 368.

Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Executive Directors' interests in ordinary shares
The Executive Directors' interests in ordinary shares of the Company at the start and end of the financial year were as follows:

(a)  Interests including shares acquired pursuant to the BG Group SIP .
(b) Or date of appointment to the Board if later.
(c) Fabio Barbosa's holdings of ordinary shares include 25 229 shares which were awarded to him in December 2010 in connection with his recruitment.
As of 15 March 2012, the Executive Directors' interests in the ordinary share capital of the Company represent less than 1% of the issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company.
Pensions
Fabio Barbosa and Chris Finlayson do not accrue any entitlement to post-retirement benefits and receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension 
contributions calculated at a rate of 30% of base salary. The amounts paid in 2011 are set out in the remuneration table on page 75.
The basis on which post-retirement benefits are calculated for Sir Frank Chapman, Martin Houston and Ashley Almanza has not changed during 
the year. Sir Frank Chapman and Ashley Almanza receive an accrual of benefits designed to target a pension of two-thirds of their final 12 months' 
salary on retirement from BG Group at age 60. Martin Houston accrues pension at the rate of 
1
/60 of his final 12 months' salary for each year of 
pensionable service.
Sir Frank Chapman, Martin Houston and Ashley Almanza were members of the BG Pension Scheme (BGPS) and the BG Supplementary Benefits 
Scheme (BGSBS) during the year. The BGPS is a funded, UK-registered pension scheme and the BGSBS is an unfunded, unregistered pension scheme. 
Sir Frank Chapman and Martin Houston elected  enhanced protection' with effect from 6 April 2006, which limits the benefits provided by the 
BGPS. Ashley Almanza's BGPS benefits are limited to the  lifetime allowance'.
Ashley Almanza stepped down from the Board on 31 March 2011. His post-retirement benefits have been calculated through to 31 December 2011. 
He remains a member of the BGPS and the BGSBS.
As is the case for all other UK employees who became BGPS members before 6 April 2006, none of the Directors can be paid an immediate pension before 
age 60 on a non-actuarially reduced basis unless they have attained age 55 and completed 10 years' service with the Group (including pensionable service 
transferred from previous employment) and the Company expressly agrees to payment on an unreduced basis, or they are over the age of 50 and have 
been made redundant, or in the event of incapacity. UK employees who became BGPS members on or after 6 April 2006 cannot be paid a non-actuarially 
reduced pension until age 60, other than in the event of incapacity. Pensions in payment are normally increased in line with retail price inflation. 
An adult dependant's pension is payable on death in service, equal to two-thirds of that payable to the BGPS member based on potential service to age 65. 
On death in retirement, an adult dependant's pension is payable equal to two-thirds of the member's pension prior to exchanging any of it 
for a cash lump sum.
A provision has been made in the Company's accounts in respect of the obligations for unfunded post-retirement benefits.
Executive Directors' pension provisions were as follows:

(d)  The transfer values shown at the end of 2010 and 2011 represent the value of each Executive Director's accrued pension based on total service completed to the relevant date. The accrued 
pensions are the amounts to which the Executive Directors would have been entitled had they left service at the relevant date. The transfer values are calculated in accordance with the 
requirements of The Occupational Pension Scheme (Transfer Values) (Amendment) Regulations 2008.
External appointments
To broaden the experience of Executive Directors, they are able to accept one external appointment as a non-executive director of another 
company provided that permission is sought from the Board in advance. Any external appointment must not conflict with the Director's duties 
and commitments to BG Group. Any fees from such appointments may be retained by the individual Executive Director. The Chief Executive, 
Sir Frank Chapman, was appointed as a non-executive director of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc on 10 November 2011 and he receives an annual fee  
of  75 000 in connection with this appointment. None of the other Executive Directors currently holds such an appointment.
Change of control
As described on page 74, the Executive Directors' service contracts contain change of control provisions.
For the purposes of these provisions, a change of control is deemed to occur if the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company; or if 
50% or more of the voting rights of the Company or the right to appoint or remove the majority of the Board of the Company become vested in 
any individual or body or group of individuals or bodies acting in concert; or if all or substantially all of the business, assets and undertakings of 
the Company become owned by any person, firm or company (other than a subsidiary or associated company). A change of control is also deemed 
to occur if the whole of the issued capital of BG Energy Holdings Limited or a substantial part of the undertaking of that Company (including its 
subsidiaries) is transferred to another company, unless that transferee company is a subsidiary of the Company, or a company ultimately owned 
by substantially the same shareholders as are the ultimate owners of the Company.
However, a change of control does not occur if (and only if) through a process of reconstruction the Company becomes a subsidiary of another 
company owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the shareholders of the Company. The Executive Directors' service contracts provide 
that any payments made pursuant to these provisions will be made, less any deductions the employer is required to make. Any such payments shall 
be in full and final settlement of any claims the Executive Director may have against the employer or any associated company arising out of the 
termination of employment, except for any personal injury claim, any claim in respect of accrued pension rights, or statutory employment 
protection claims.
Non-Executive Directors
The Board aims to recruit Non-Executive Directors of a high calibre, with broad commercial, international or other relevant experience. Non-Executive 
Directors are appointed by the Board on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee. Their appointment is for an initial term of three years, 
subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM following their appointment and annual re-election thereafter. The terms of engagement of the 
Non-Executive Directors are set out in a letter of appointment.
The basic annual fee paid to Non-Executive Directors is  77 500. Additional fees are also payable, for example, for membership of, or chairing, 
a Committee of the Board and for acting as Senior Independent Director. The current remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors requires 
that fees are reviewed every two years, taking into account time commitment, competition for high-quality non-executive directors and market 
movements. The next review will be effective 1 July 2012.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Company's share schemes, incentive schemes or pension schemes.
To facilitate the alignment of the interests of the Non-Executive Directors with those of shareholders, the Group has put in place a Non-Executive 
Directors' share purchase programme through which Non-Executive Directors may elect to invest a proportion of their fees, net of tax and 
on a regular basis, to acquire BG Group shares on the open market. The first deductions were made under this programme in January 2010.
