 The Committee believes it is essential that 
BG Group's remuneration policy is clearly 
aligned with the interests of shareholders. 
The Committee's focus is on continuing to 
ensure BG Group's remuneration policy and 
components of reward are appropriately 
positioned in the market to enable it to attract, 
retain and motivate the executive talent required 
for delivery of its long-term business strategy.
As set out on page 68, the underlying 
performance of the business during 2012 relative 
to the annual bonus performance metrics set was 
solid. Accordingly, a bonus award would normally 
have been considered at a level between target 
and stretch. However, the Executive Directors 
and the former Chief Executive all concluded 
that, in recognition of the revision of BG Group's 
anticipated production growth for 2013 and 
the share price fall in the final quarter of the 
year, it would be inappropriate for them to be 
considered for a bonus in respect of 2012. The 
Committee agreed with this and, consequently, 
no bonuses for 2012 were awarded to the 
Executive Directors and former Chief Executive. 
The subject of executive reward continues 
to be an area of focus for shareholders and the 
wider public. During 2012, the Department for 
Business, Innovation & Skills (BIS) issued two 
consultation documents on this subject. While 
the new regulations governing the shareholder 
approval and reporting of executive reward which 
have resulted from this consultation process will 
not come into force until BG Group's 2013 financial 
year, we have incorporated a number of changes 
included in the 2012 draft proposals this year.
In summary, the changes are:
   division of the report into two distinct sections: 
the first (pages 61 to 66) dealing with BG Group's 
remuneration policy; and the second (pages 66 
to 75) with the implementation of that policy 
during 2012 (this section also includes 
information required to be reported under 
current legislation and regulations);
   the policy section sets out the components 
of reward, how they are linked to the business 
strategy, and reward opportunities for each 
of the Executive Directors; and
   the implementation section reports 
remuneration of the Executive Directors for 
the 2012 financial year and includes a table 
showing the build-up of total pay for each 
Executive Director.
Further draft regulations were published by BIS 
on 8 March 2013 and these will be considered for 
reporting purposes in our 2013 Remuneration 
Report. As set out in our Notice of AGM, there 
will continue to be a single advisory vote on our 
2012 Remuneration report at this year's AGM.
We announced in December 2012 that Chris 
Finlayson, previously Executive Director and 
Managing Director, BG Advance, would succeed 
Sir Frank Chapman as Chief Executive on 
1 January 2013. Further details of the reward 
arrangements of the new Chief Executive 
are outlined to the right of this letter.
The market in which BG Group operates and 
competes for talent is global. The Committee 
believes that the Group 's overall remuneration policy, 
reward components and emphasis on performance-
related reward continue to be appropriate. 
However, it will keep these under review.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
shareholders for their continued support.

transition, until his retirement in June 2013.
He will continue to receive his base salary 
and other elements of his current reward 
package until his retirement. His outstanding 
share awards under the Deferred Bonus Plan 
(DBP) and LTIP will vest on the date of his 
retirement in accordance with the rules of 
those plans. In respect of the LTIP , awards will 
only vest to the extent that the performance 
conditions have been met at the end of the 
month prior to his month of retirement. 
Time pro-rating will apply.
60 www.bg-group.com Corporate governance Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Market-competitive reward
BG Group aims to provide market-competitive 
levels of reward designed to assist it in 
attracting, recruiting and retaining the executive 
talent required to deliver the business strategy.  
A large proportion of the reward opportunity is 
performance-related, providing executives with 
the potential to receive significant amounts 
where exceptional sustained performance is 
achieved. The key reward components provided 
to the Executive Directors (and other members 
of the GEC) are reviewed annually on a total 
reward basis. Individual components of reward 
are not reviewed in isolation. Instead, the overall 
reward package is considered. This review typically 
takes place prior to any changes in Executive 
Directors' base salaries which, if made, normally 
take effect from 1 April in any year. (The key 
components of reward and their linkage to 
BG Group's business strategy are summarised 
on pages 62 and 63).
The annual review involves consideration of 
a number of factors, including the individual's 
performance and experience, overall corporate 
performance, the position of each Executive

POLICY SECTION
Remuneration policy
BG Group's remuneration policy is clear and well-defined and is summarised below:
Director's reward package relative to the market, 
and pay and employment conditions across 
the Group. The principal external comparator 
groups, against which Executive Directors' 
reward is reviewed, currently include the FTSE 30 
(excluding financial services) and BG Group's 
most closely comparable international oil and 
gas peers, although these groups too are kept 
under review to ensure they remain appropriate.
In defining BG Group's remuneration policy, 
the Committee takes into account advice 
received from external consultants and also 
best practice guidelines set by regulators 
and institutional shareholder bodies, including 
the principles and guidelines on executive 
remuneration issued by the Association of 
British Insurers (ABI). The Committee has also 
followed the principles of Section D of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code that relate 
to remuneration.
The current intention is that the framework 
of this remuneration policy which operated 
during 2012 will apply for future years.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Committee's principal  
responsibilities are:
   setting, reviewing and recommending 
to the Board for approval the Group's 
overall remuneration policy and strategy;
   setting, reviewing and approving the 
remuneration arrangements (including 
any bonuses, incentive payments, share 
awards, pension and benefit arrangements, 
and termination payments) of the 
Chairman, Chief Executive and 
Executive Directors;
   reviewing and approving the remuneration 
arrangements (including any bonuses, 
incentive payments, share awards, 
pension and benefit arrangements, 
and termination payments) of members 
of the GEC who are not Executive 
Directors, and the Company  
Secretary; and
   reviewing and approving the rules 
of (and any significant amendment to) 
any long-term incentive plan (whether 
cash or share-based), deferred bonus plan, 
cash-based incentive plan, or share plan, 
subject to final approval by the Board  
and/or shareholders, where necessary.

SUMMARY OF BG GROUP'S REMUNERATION POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS  
AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GROUP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
Shareholder-aligned  	 The	performance-related	incentive	arrangements	
are designed to align the interests of executives with those of 
shareholders and establish a clear link between remuneration 
and sustained individual and corporate performance. 
 	 BG	Group's	shareholding	guidelines	encourage	Executive	
Directors, GEC members and certain other senior 
employees to build up (over a period of five years from 
appointment) and retain a minimum holding of shares. 
Market-competitive and 
aligned with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code
 	 The	policy	is	designed	to	deliver	reward	that	will	
facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of 
the executive talent necessary to deliver successfully 
BG Group's growth strategy.
 	 It	takes	appropriate	account	of	the	Governance	Code	
and best practice guidelines published by regulators 
and institutional shareholder bodies.
Performance-related  	 At	the	Executive	Director	and	senior	manager	levels,	
the majority of the reward opportunity is provided 
through performance-related incentives.
 	 Reward	under	these	incentives	is	linked	to	both	
individual and BG Group's performance. When setting 
targets and assessing performance, appropriate account 
is taken of business risk and the delivery of sustained 
returns to shareholders.
The above principles are reviewed annually to ensure they continue to be appropriate  
and support BG Group's business strategy.
61
Corporate governance
Remuneration report continued Performance-related reward
The majority of the reward opportunity 
provided to Executive Directors (and 
other members of the GEC) is through  
performance-related incentives.
Executive Directors and other members of the 
GEC participate in two performance-related 
incentive arrangements, as follows:
   the Annual Incentive Scheme - designed 
to focus the executives on the business 
priorities of the financial year and 
to reinforce the individual and Group 
performance ethic; and
   the Long-Term Incentive Plan - designed 
to reward and retain executives over the 
longer term while also aligning their interests 
with those of BG Group shareholders. The 
LTIP allows for various types of awards to 
be made (specifically Group Share Awards*, 
Performance Share Awards and Market 
Value Options). 
The two incentive arrangements complement 
each other and enable the measurement 
and reward of both short and long-term 
performance. In particular, the Committee 
considers that these complementary incentive 
arrangements take appropriate account of 
business risk and align the reward arrangements 
of executives with the delivery of sustained 
returns to shareholders.
SUMMARY OF BG GROUP'S REMUNERATION POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GROUP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
Base salary
To attract and retain 
talent by ensuring base 
salaries are competitive 
in the market in 
which the individual 
is employed.
Annual Incentive 
Scheme 
Cash, automatic 
deferral, voluntary 
deferral
Performance metrics 
are selected each year 
to focus executives on 
the strategic business 
priorities for the 
financial year.
The Deferred Bonus 
Plan (DBP) and the 
Voluntary Bonus 
Deferral Plan (VBDP) 
are also designed 
to provide further 
alignment with 
shareholder interests.
Long-Term 
Incentive Plan 
Awards over 
BG Group shares
Designed to reward 
and retain executives 
over the longer term 
while aligning their 
interests with 
those of BG Group 
shareholders.
Benefits 
Designed to be 
competitive within the 
market in which the 
individual is employed.
Pension
Designed to be 
competitive within the 
market in which the 
individual is employed.
Generally reviewed annually, and any increase typically takes effect from 
1 April. The review involves the consideration of market position relative 
to relevant comparator groups, and is also influenced by:
 	 the	individual	executive's	role,	experience	and performance;
 	 business	performance,	and	the	wider	market	and economic	
conditions; and
 	 the	range	of	salary	increases	applying	across	the Group.
The Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS) is reviewed annually prior to the 
start of each financial year to ensure the bonus opportunity, performance 
measures and weightings are appropriate and continue to support the 
business strategy. Stretching financial and non-financial performance 
targets are set at the start of each financial year.
Actual AIS amounts are determined via a two-stage process. Firstly, 
performance against the agreed metrics is assessed. Secondly, the Committee 
reviews these results in the context of underlying business performance 
and may adjust the stage one outcome at its discretion.
AIS awards are subject to automatic and voluntary deferral into awards over 
BG Group shares. Automatic deferral for AIS awards in excess of 100% of 
base salary is under the DBP into Deferred Bonus Awards over BG Group 
shares. The vesting of Deferred Bonus Awards may be reduced in 
circumstances where the Company becomes aware of misconduct 
or performance issues relevant to the bonus award year.
Executives are also able to defer voluntarily a proportion of their AIS award 
into a Deferred Share Award over BG Group shares under the VBDP in the 
same way as other eligible employees. The automatic and voluntary deferral 
arrangements are reviewed periodically. Details of the arrangements 
applying in 2012 and 2013 are set out in the Implementation section 
on page 69.
To date, the Committee has granted only Performance Share Awards 
to members of the GEC. The Award levels and performance conditions 
on which vesting will be dependent are reviewed annually to ensure 
they remain appropriate.
Awards are typically granted annually in September. A number of factors 
are considered when determining the level of any grant of Performance 
Share Awards, including position of the executive's reward package 
relative to the market; the executive's performance and experience; 
the face value and estimated present value (EPV) of the proposed 
award; and plan dilution limits.
Benefits typically include life assurance, annual leave and medical 
insurance. Where appropriate, a company car or cash in lieu and/or 
flexible benefit arrangements may be offered.
Chauffeur services, where appropriate to assist with their roles, 
may also be provided.
Executives may also participate in all-employee share plans on the 
same terms as other employees.
Executives who have joined BG Group since April 2007 can choose to 
participate in the relevant local defined contribution pension arrangement or 
receive a cash allowance or a combination thereof. Executives who joined 
BG Group in the UK prior to April 2007 can continue to participate in the 
UK defined benefit pension arrangement which is closed to new entrants.

Remuneration report continued Base salary increases will be applied in line 
with the outcome of the review.
The AIS offers a maximum opportunity of up to 
200% of base salary with a target opportunity of up 
to 100% of base salary. Each year, the Remuneration 
Committee determines maximum and target AIS 
opportunities on an individual basis within those 
scheme limits. Individual limits for Executive 
Directors for 2012 and 2013 (which vary by role) are 
set out in the Implementation section on page 68. 
Scheme limits may be exceeded in exceptional 
circumstances, such as recruitment.
Individual awards under the LTIP are subject 
to the following limits in normal circumstances:
 	 an	overall	EPV	limit	of	300%	base	salary;	and
 	 the	face	value	of	each	type	of	award	cannot	
exceed 600% of base salary.
Both limits may be exceeded in exceptional 
circumstances, such as recruitment.
EPV is a measure that describes the economic or 
fair value of an award. The measure takes account 
of the performance conditions and the risk that 
grants and allocations may be forfeited. EPV 
is calculated independently by the Committee's 
advisers. The face value of an award is equal to 
the number of shares, or shares under option, 
multiplied by the relevant share price.
Benefit values vary by role and are reviewed 
periodically to market.
Current pension opportunity varies dependent upon 
the scheme in which the executive is a participant. 
Details for the current Executive Directors are set 
out in the Implementation section on page 73.
Individual and business performance are 
considerations in setting base salary.
No change has been made to the salary review process.
Base salary increases consistent with this policy 
were made effective 1 April 2012 as set out in the 
Implementation section on page 67.
The policy will continue to operate for the 2013 
base salary review process.
Executives' performance is measured relative 
to challenging budget and stretch targets in key 
operational areas. The areas selected, and their 
relative weighting, vary each year depending 
upon strategic priorities. Measures used for 
the 2012 AIS, are set out in the Implementation 
section on page 68.
No changes are being made to the AIS performance 
metrics or opportunity range for 2013.
Performance Share Awards do not normally vest 
until the third anniversary of the date of grant. 
The vesting of the awards granted is usually 
subject to the following conditions:
 	 continued	employment;
 	 the	individual's	performance	not	having	fallen	
significantly below that expected since the 
date of grant; and
 	 the	Company's	performance	over	a	three-year	
performance period.
Performance measures applied to L TIP awards are reviewed 
annually by the Committee to ensure they remain relevant 
to strategic priorities and aligned to shareholder interests. 
Measures used for the 2012 LTIP award are set out in 
the Implementation section on page 69. In exceptional 
circumstances, such as recruitment, Performance Share 
Awards or Market Value Options may be granted 
without performance conditions.
Following the completion of the strategy review 
currently being undertaken by the new Chief Executive 
(due to be announced on 14 May 2013), the performance 
measures applying for future grants (including those 
to be granted in September 2013) of Performance 
Share Awards will be reviewed.
In line with the commitment given to shareholders 
at the 2008 AGM, to the extent that any changes are 
made to the performance conditions and the new 
conditions are not substantively the same as existing 
conditions, these will be discussed with major 
shareholders before any awards are made.
Not performance-related. No changes have been made to the structure of the 
benefits offered during the year. No changes are 
planned for 2013.
Not performance-related. Subject to the outcome of statutory employee 
consultation, it is proposed that the legacy UK defined 
benefit arrangements will close to future accrual 
from 1 December 2013.

ILLUSTRATION OF POTENTIAL REWARD OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The graphs below provide estimates of the potential future reward opportunity for each of the Executive Directors based 
on their roles (effective 1 January 2013), the remuneration policy outlined on page 61 and the base salary at 1 April 2012 
(except in the case of the new Chief Executive, Chris Finlayson, where the base salary effective 1 January 2013 has been 
used). Fabio Barbosa stepped down from the Board and GEC with effect from 15 February 2013. As the process for 
selecting a permanent replacement is currently ongoing, the reward package for Fabio Barbosa has been used in the 
illustration below, as it is anticipated that the ongoing package of any replacement will be based on similar principles.
As all the Executive Directors are paid in Pounds Sterling, the Committee considers it appropriate that the figures detailed 
below be presented in Pounds Sterling. The amounts illustrated are annualised.
The figures reported above each scenario bar chart represent percentage of total remuneration.
For AIS, the amounts illustrated are those potentially 
receivable in respect of performance for 2013. For the 
LTIP, the award opportunities are those expected to 
be granted in 2013 assuming award levels remain the 
same as a percentage of base salary as those awarded 
in 2012 (see page 70). It should be noted that the LTIP 
awards granted in a year do not normally vest until 
the third anniversary of the date of grant. As set out 
in the remuneration policy table on page 62, the 
Company operates mandatory deferral of AIS amounts 
into BG Group shares under the DBP for AIS awards 
in excess of 100% of base salary, and voluntary deferral 
under the VBDP. 
In illustrating potential reward opportunities the following assumptions have been made:
AIS LTIP Base and pension
Maximum AIS amounts are awarded 
at maximum level.
Performance such that 
awards vest at maximum level 
(100% of awards made).
Base salary, benefits and pension or cash in 
lieu of pension are provided in all scenarios. 
The Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officer receive cash in lieu of pension 
(at a rate of 30% of base salary); the Chief 
Operating Officer participates in a defined 
benefit pension. It has been assumed this 
continues throughout 2013. The estimated 
cost has been calculated in accordance with 
the currently proposed BIS methodology.
Target AIS amounts are awarded 
at target levels.
Performance such that awards 
vest at threshold level (25%).
Minimum Threshold level for each metric 
not achieved. No AIS payable.
Threshold performance 
not achieved.
In all scenarios, the impact of share price movements on the value of LTIP awards, mandatory AIS deferrals into the DBP and voluntary deferrals 
into the VBDP have been excluded.

The Committee is kept regularly informed 
of the pay and benefits provided to employees 
below the GEC. In particular, as set out in 
the remuneration policy table on page 62, 
when considering the base salary increases 
for executives, one of the factors considered 
by the Committee is the range of base pay 
increases applying elsewhere in the Group.
The following table provides a summary 
of the 2012 increase in base salary for the 
Chief Executive, as compared with the average 
increase for the general employee population 
in April 2012.

The Committee does not directly consult 
with employees when formulating Executive 
Director pay policy. However, it does take into 
account information provided by the Human 
Resources function and feedback from 
employee satisfaction surveys.
Further details of the base salary increases 
awarded during 2012 to the Executive Directors 
are set out in the Implementation section 
of this report on page 67.
Service contracts
The Executive Directors' service contracts, 
including arrangements for early termination, 
are carefully considered by the Committee and 
are designed to recruit, retain and motivate 
Directors of the quality required to manage 
the Company. The Committee considers 
that a rolling contract with a notice period 
of one year is appropriate.
The Committee does reserve the right, in order 
to attract and retain suitable candidates, to 
offer contracts that contain an initial notice 
period in excess of one year, reducing to a rolling 
one-year period after the expiry of this period.
Cascade to senior executives  
below the Executive Directors
The policy and practice with regard to the 
remuneration of senior executives below 
the Executive Directors who are members 
of the GEC is consistent with that for the 
Executive Directors. These senior executives 
all have a significant portion of their reward 
package linked to performance. They 
are eligible for the AIS and awards under 
the LTIP and their financial and non-financial 
performance targets are cascaded from 
the targets for the Executive Directors. 
The Committee reviews and approves the 
individual remuneration packages for the 
GEC members and the Company Secretary 
in accordance with the overriding objectives 
of the Group's remuneration policy. Their 
individual performance is reviewed and any 
increase in their base salary, AIS payments 
and any LTIP awards is subject to approval 
by the Committee each year.
Senior employees below GEC level are generally 
treated consistently with the Executive Directors 
and members of the GEC, with the exception 
that they may participate in local discretionary 
plans. They are also eligible to receive awards 
under the LTIP, subject to the overall limits 
on levels of individual awards under the LTIP.
Awards under the LTIP may take the form 
of Performance Share Awards, Market Value 
Options or Group Share Awards. Group Share 
Awards will normally vest three years after the 
date of grant subject to continued employment 
and the individual employee's performance 
not having fallen significantly below that 
expected since the date of grant.
Eligible employees (other than members of 
the GEC) who participate in the VBDP are able 
to benefit from a 10% uplift on the proportion 
of AIS deferred, provided they hold their deferred 
award for at least three years. 
Employee context
BG Group values its employees and aims to provide 
reward packages that are market-competitive 
within that employee's country of employment. 
The structure of employees' reward cascades 
from that of the executives and senior 
management. Where appropriate and feasible 
(for example under local legislation or practice) 
employees participate in the AIS and LTIP 
arrangements, with their target and maximum 
levels of participation being set by reference to 
the local market in which they are employed.
In order to encourage share ownership, the 
Company currently provides two all-employee 
UK HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) approved 
share plans for its UK employees: the Share 
Incentive Plan (SIP) and Sharesave; and for 
non-UK employees in a number of key overseas 
locations, an all-employee Global Partnership 
Plan is provided.

Retirement date There is no default retirement 
age. Requests for retirement 
are considered on a case by 
case basis. At the Executive 
Director level, it is expected 
that at least 12 months' 
notice must be provided.
Remuneration Base salary.

Termination payment Contractual provisions exist 
in the event of a change of 
control (see paragraph below). 
The rules of the AIS and LTIP 
also include certain provisions 
on termination of employment. 
These are discussed further 
in the Exit payments policy 
section on page 66.
Non-competition During employment and 
for six months thereafter.
In line with the Company's policy, the Executive 
Directors' service contracts contain change 
of control provisions. Should the Executive 
Director's employment be terminated within 
12 months of a change of control, they are 
entitled to liquidated damages. The amount 
of liquidated damages is equal to one year's 
gross salary plus currently a credit of one 
year's pensionable service for those Executive 
Directors who are members of the defined 
benefit pension scheme (or one year's cash 
allowance in lieu of pension if the Executive

entitlement to post-retirement defined benefits) 
less any deductions the employer is required 
to make, which the Committee considers to be 
a genuine pre-estimate of loss. The Committee 
considers that these provisions assist with 
recruitment and retention and that their 
inclusion is therefore in the best interests 
of shareholders.

Consideration of shareholder views
The Company is committed to ongoing dialogue 
with shareholders and welcomes feedback 
on Directors' remuneration. The Committee 
believes it has a responsible approach to Directors' 
pay and that its policy is appropriate and fit 
for purpose.
Generally, shareholders were comfortable 
with the remuneration policy in place, 
as evidenced by a 94% approval of the 2011 
Directors' Remuneration report at the 2012 
AGM. Further details are set out on page 75 
of the Implementation section.
Relative importance of spend on pay
The graph below details BG Group's post-tax 
profits, dividends and total Group-wide 
expenditure on pay for all employees 
(this includes pension, variable pay and social 
security), as reported in the audited financial 
statements for the last two financial years.
This information has been presented to assist 
shareholders in assessing the importance of 
spend on pay, in accordance with the proposed 
draft legislation published by BIS in June 2012. 
In future years, the Company may change 
the information presented in order to comply 
with the finalised regulations and provide 
meaningful information to shareholders.
Exit payments policy
Other than change of control, the Executive 
Directors' service contracts do not contain 
provisions for compensation in the event 
of early termination. When determining 
termination payments, the Committee takes 
into account a variety of factors, including 
individual and Company performance, the 
obligation for the Director to mitigate his or 
her own loss (for example, by gaining new 
employment) and the Director's length of 
service. It is expected that any exit payments 
made to executives would not exceed one year's 
base salary and benefits which is consistent 
with their notice period of 12 months.
The rules of the Company's AIS also provide 
that: (i) in the event of a change in control, 
where the AIS is not carried forward under 
new ownership; or (ii) in the event an employee 
ceases employment for an agreed reason (such 
as ill health, agreed retirement or redundancy), 
then to the extent performance metrics have 
been satisfied at the date of the change, or 
cessation of employment (as appropriate), 
AIS amounts may be paid, pro-rated to reflect 
the number of days of employment in the 
relevant financial year.
Share awards under the Company's Deferred 
Bonus Plan do not normally vest for three years 
and are subject to forfeiture in the event of 
leaving employment (other than for reasons 
such as ill health, agreed retirement or 
redundancy where share awards would 
vest when employment ceases).
Additionally, all the Company's share plans 
contain provisions relating to a change of control. 
In general, outstanding awards and options 
would normally vest and become exercisable 
on a change of control, to the extent that any 
performance conditions have been satisfied 
at that time. If the Committee considers it 
appropriate given the circumstances of the 
change of control, time pro-rating may also apply.
The LTIP rules also provide in the event an 
employee ceases employment prior to the 
vesting of an award for an agreed reason (such 
as ill health, agreed retirement or redundancy) 
then, to the extent any performance metrics 
have been met at that time, the award would 
normally vest when employment ceases 
on a pro-rated basis to reflect the proportion 
of the vesting period during which the 
individual was employed.

IMPLEMENTATION SECTION
The following section of this report provides 
details of the implementation of the policy for 
the year ended 31 December 2012. As all the 
current Directors are paid in Pounds Sterling, 
the Committee considers it appropriate 
that the figures disclosed in this report be 
presented in Pounds Sterling.
The Remuneration Committee met four 
times during the year ended 31 December 2012. 
Steve Allen, Company Secretary, attended 
meetings as Secretary to the Committee.
The following individuals attended meetings by 
invitation and provided advice to the Committee 
to enable it to make informed decisions:
   Sir Frank Chapman, former Chief Executive;
   Robert Booker, Executive Vice President, 
Human Resources; and
   Jane Crowther, General Manager Human 
Resources Function.
No individual was present when their own 
remuneration was being discussed. The 
Committee also meets without management 
present and receives information and independent 
executive remuneration advice from Kepler 
Associates*, an external consultancy appointed 
by the Committee. During 2012, Kepler Associates 
provided advice to the Committee on market 
trends, incentive schemes and other remuneration 
issues. Kepler Associates does not advise 
BG Group on any other issues.
Kepler Associates have provided independent 
advice to the Committee since December 2004. 
During 2012, the Committee ran a re-tender 
process and invited a number of leading 
remuneration consultants to tender. Following 
this exercise, the Committee decided to re-appoint 
Kepler Associates as its independent adviser.
Other external advisers may also provide support 
and advice in relation to executive remuneration 
to the Committee, as required. These advisers 
are appointed by management or the relevant 
Trustees, as appropriate. During the year, 
Towers Watson provided advice and market 
information on executive remuneration to 
the Committee. Towers Watson also provided 
general compensation, benefits information 
and general consultancy services to the Group, 
as well as actuarial advise to the Trustees of 
the BG Pension Scheme.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' BASE SALARIES
As set out on page 70 of our 2011 Remuneration report, the new positions of Chief Operating Officer and Managing Director, BG Advance were 
created on 15 November 2011. The base salaries of the individual Executive Directors were not reviewed at that stage, but instead their increased 
responsibilities were considered as part of the annual salary review process in March 2012. As indicated in the remuneration Policy section, when 
awarding base salary increases, the Committee also has regard to base salary increases operated elsewhere in the Group. The average annual 
salary increases that applied across the Group in April 2012 were 4.6%.

(a) The base salary increases awarded to Martin Houston and Chris Finlayson in April 2012 are reflective of their substantially increased responsibilities in their new roles.
(b) Chris Finlayson was appointed Chief Executive with effect from 1 January 2013.
(a) With effect from 9 September 2012, Den Jones, the Group Financial Controller, was appointed Fabio Barbosa's Alternate Director, 
while Mr Barbosa was granted leave of absence to undergo medical treatment. Fabio Barbosa continued to receive his normal remuneration 
while on leave of absence in line with the Company's sick leave policy. Den Jones received no additional remuneration in connection with his 
role as Fabio Barbosa's Alternate Director. In recognition of his temporary increased workload and team management responsibilities (but not 
his responsibilities as an Alternate Director) a temporary, non-pensionable additional allowance was paid.
(b) The remuneration reported is that received for qualifying services as an Executive Director. Fabio Barbosa and Chris Finlayson served as 
Executive Directors for only part of 2011. The figures reported for 2011 do not therefore reflect a 12-month period. As an Alternate Director, 
Den Jones did not undertake any qualifying services as an Executive Director, accordingly no remuneration is reported.
(c) The reported salary figures for the Executive Directors reflect any adjustments as a result of the operation of the flexible benefits plan 
including SIP Flex Shares Plan allocations (the maximum allocation was  2 998 in 2012 ( 2 987 in 2011)). As mentioned in the introduction, 
Chris Finlayson's base salary increased to  975 000 per annum on 1 January 2013 on his appointment as Chief Executive.
(d) Taxable benefits include items such as company car, or cash in lieu of car where chosen (see below), driver, financial advice and 
medical insurance.
(e) Benefits and other emoluments include a cash allowance in lieu of a company car for Sir Frank Chapman, Fabio Barbosa and Chris Finlayson. 
In April 2012, Chris Finlayson changed from receiving a trade-down cash allowance in respect of his company car to a cash allowance in lieu of 
company car. 
(f) Bonus. No bonus was awarded in respect of 2012. Further details are set out on page 68.
(g) Pensions. Sir Frank Chapman and Martin Houston are members of defined benefit plans. The amounts shown above in respect of the increase 
in the value of their accrued pension benefit during 2012 have been calculated on the proposed BIS calculation basis, using a Consumer Price 
Inflation figure of 2.7% (at 31 December 2012) and a multiplier of 20. This methodology is different from that prescribed by the occupational 
pension transfer value regulations. Therefore the amounts shown above differ from those in the pensions section on page 73.
(h) Long-Term Incentive Plan - annual award. This is the market value of the shares that vested on 7 September 2012. 44% of the original 
award vested as explained on page 70. The share price at the date of vesting was  12.695. This amount includes the value of dividend equivalent 
shares accrued during the vesting period which also vested on 7 September 2012.
(i) Long-Term Incentive Plan - on-hire award. This is the market value of the shares that vested on 1 August 2012. 74% of the original award 
vested as explained on page 70. The share price at the date of vesting was  12.635. This amount includes the value of dividend equivalent 
shares accrued during the vesting period which also vested on 1 August 2012.

BONUS - EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' AWARDS UNDER THE ANNUAL INCENTIVE SCHEME
Annual Incentive Scheme
The performance measures which operated for the 2012 financial year are illustrated in the chart below.
AIS amounts in excess of 100% of base salary are automatically deferred into Deferred Bonus Awards over BG Group shares (under the DBP). Shares 
subject to these awards are not normally released to the individual for three years and are subject to forfeiture in the event of leaving employment 
(other than for reasons such as ill health, agreed retirement or redundancy) and in such circumstances early release would normally apply. Under the 
DBP, the number of shares actually delivered may be reduced in circumstances where the Company becomes aware of misconduct or performance 
issues relevant to the bonus award year.
AIS amounts may also be voluntarily deferred into awards over BG Group shares under the VBDP , which operates in a number of BG Group's key locations. 
All employees participating in the AIS arrangements (including members of the GEC*) in these countries are eligible to participate in the VBDP . Eligible 
employees may choose to defer any percentage (between 1% and 100%) of their AIS award (up to 100% of base salary) into a Deferred Share Award 
over BG Group shares. This award may be exercised within five years of the date of grant. The balance of the AIS award (up to 100% of base salary) 
is paid in cash.
For the 2012 incentive year, the Committee followed the two-stage review process outlined in the Policy section. This involves for each metric 
a review of performance against targets and, secondly, consideration of the outcomes of the first stage in the context of the underlying performance 
of the business, including operational performance, strategy and business development activities, and performance against industry peers. 
For the 2012 incentive year, the AIS business performance outcomes were as follows (all measures are Group-wide):
Metric
Weighting  
% Performance outcome Threshold |  | Target | Stretch Commentary
Group EPS 38 Between target  
and stretch
Normalised EPS above target outcome consistent 
with overall Group EPS outcome.
Group ROACE 12 Approaching  
stretch
Group ROACE towards stretch.
Project performance 20 In line with target
Good progress was made on projects in the year.
HSSE 15 Below target Performance was assessed at below target 
in a number of areas.
Overall assessment Between target  
and stretch
As shown above, for the 2012 financial year the underlying performance of the business relative to the performance metrics set was solid. 
Accordingly, an AIS award would normally have been considered at a level between target and stretch.
However, in recognition of the Group's revision of its anticipated production growth for 2013 and the share price fall in the final quarter of the year, 
the Executive Directors all concluded that it would be inappropriate for them to receive an AIS award this year and asked the Committee that they 
not be considered for a bonus. The Committee agreed to accept these requests, and accordingly the Executive Directors were not considered for 
a bonus.

* Eligible employees, other than members of the GEC, who participate in the VBDP are able to benefit from a 10% uplift on the proportion deferred, provided they hold their deferred award for 
at least three years. 
2012 AIS performance metrics
(a) Group EPS - Actual business performance results are adjusted to exclude the effects of changes in upstream prices, material exchange rates, 
contracted LNG prices and the Comg s regulatory current account. For a reconciliation between business performance and total results, see note 1, 
page 93 and note 9, page 103.
(b) Group ROACE - Actual post-tax business performance results (adjusted as in note (a) above but excluding net finance income/costs on 
net borrowings/funds) are expressed as a percentage of average Group capital employed. Average Group capital employed is calculated 
by averaging the positions at the start and end of the year. Group capital employed is the aggregate of total equity (excluding commodity 
financial instruments and associated deferred tax) and net borrowings/funds (in both cases adjusted to exclude the impact of changes in 
upstream prices and material exchange rates).
(c) Group HSSE - a balanced scorecard measures performance across a range of leading and lagging indicators.
(d) Project performance - assesses in-year performance on all Board-sanctioned projects, both operated and non-operated, against a range 
of indicators, including in-year cost and schedule performance relative to plan.

is conditional upon continued employment until the end of the deferral period.
(c) Subject to no issues being identified in relation to conduct or performance for the relevant bonus years (2010 and 2011), these awards will vest in full on cessation of Sir Frank Chapman's employment 
in June 2013.

(a) All VBDP awards granted to UK employees were granted in the form of nil-cost options. Under normal circumstances, the VBDP awards vest three months after the date of grant and may 
be exercised at any time up to the fifth anniversary of the date of grant.
(b) Dividend equivalent shares accrue on all VBDP awards between grant and exercise. This is consistent with awards made to all employees participating in the VBDP.
* TSR is defined as the return on investment obtained from holding a company's shares over a period. It includes dividends paid, the 
change in the capital value of the shares and other payments to or by shareholders within the period. TSR is calculated on a common 
currency basis to ensure that international comparisons are fair. The Committee believes that TSR relative to a weighted peer group 
index is an appropriate measure of relative performance.
PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS
Performance Share Awards are typically granted 
annually in early September. Awards will normally 
vest three years after the date of grant. The 
vesting is conditional on:
   continued employment;
   the individual employee's performance 
not having fallen significantly below that 
expected since the date of grant; and
   the Company's total shareholder return (TSR)* 
performance over a three-year performance 
period. This is detailed further below.
There is a further overriding condition that 
the Committee must be satisfied that the 
underlying performance of the Group justifies 
the level of vesting.
TSR performance for the Performance 
Share Awards is measured over a three-year 
performance period commencing on the first day 
of the calendar month in which the award is 
made. There is no retest provision. As awards 
are typically granted in September, the three-year 
performance period usually runs from 1 September 
within a financial year to 31 August within the 
financial year ending three years later.
The level of Performance Share Awards 
vesting is related to the Company's TSR 
performance over this period relative to a 
weighted index of a selection of oil and gas 
industry peers. The constituents of the index 
are reviewed annually to ensure the most 
comparable peer group companies are used.
The vesting levels of the Performance Share 
Awards are illustrated in the graph to the left 
and the table below.
BG Group's performance relative

Linear sliding scale 
(between 25% and

The TSR performance calculation is 
multiplicative; that is, if the index grows from 
100% to 110%, then BG Group is required to 
move from 100% to 134.75% (i.e. 110% x 107%

) 
over three years to achieve maximum vesting.

(a) The potential constituents of the index are reviewed annually to ensure they continue to be appropriate.
The performance period for the 2009 Performance Share Awards ended on 31 August 2012. BG Group's TSR performance relative to the weighted 
index was measured by the independent TSR monitoring service of Alithos Limited and reviewed by Kepler Associates. This analysis indicated that 
BG Group had outperformed the index by 1.76% per annum on average, and as a result 44% of the shares awarded should vest. The Committee 
considered this together with the underlying financial performance of the Group and the individual performance of the executives, and concluded 
44% of the shares awarded to executives would vest. Accordingly the awards vested on 7 September 2012.
During the year, the performance period ended for an element of an on-hire Performance Share Award granted in September 2010 to Chris Finlayson 
in connection with his recruitment. A maximum of 31 666 shares subject to this award were available for vesting. The level of vesting was dependent 
on BG Group's TSR performance relative to the 2010 weighted index of industry peers over the two-year period to 31 July 2012. This was measured 
by the independent TSR monitoring service of Alithos Limited and indicated that BG Group had outperformed the index by 4.6% per annum on 
average. Accordingly, 74% (23 534 shares) of the shares awarded vested on 1 August 2012.

performance will be measured began on 1 September 2012. The awards will not vest until 4 September 2015. For 2012, the EPV of a Performance Share 
Award was calculated as 44%, and of a Group Share Award as 86%, of the market value of the underlying share. LTIP awards granted to an individual 
in a financial year cannot exceed a total EPV of 300% of base salary (other than in exceptional circumstances such as recruitment). The maximum 
EPV of LTIP awards granted to an individual in 2012 (other than in exceptional circumstances such as recruitment) was 264%.

(a) Executive Directors received only grants of Performance Share Awards. All Performance Share Awards granted to UK employees from September 2009 were granted in the form of nil-cost options. 
Under normal circumstances, the awards will not vest and the options will not become exercisable until after the end of the three-year vesting period which began on the date of grant of the awards. 
Once vested the options are exercisable until the seventh anniversary of the vesting date but will be automatically exercised on an employee leaving the Company if not already exercised. The level  
of vesting is dependent on the Company's TSR performance over a three-year period relative to a weighted index of a selection of industry peers. The performance conditions for the awards from 2009 
onwards are set out on pages 69 and 70.
(b) Dividend equivalent shares accrue on all Performance Share Awards throughout the vesting period; 10 322, 3 617 and 397 dividend equivalent shares accrued to Sir Frank Chapman, Martin Houston 
and Chris Finlayson respectively, in connection with the vesting of the Performance Share Awards during the year.
(c) Subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions, these awards will vest on a time pro-rated basis on the cessation of Sir Frank Chapman's employment in June 2013.
(d) The awards granted to Chris Finlayson in September 2010 include an award made in connection with his recruitment in July 2010. This award vests in three equal tranches over the period to 1 August 2013, 
subject to BG Group's TSR performance. At 31 December 2012, 31 668 shares subject to this award were unvested.
(e) The vested nil-cost options relating to Martin Houston's 7 September 2009 award were exercised in full on his behalf on 7 September 2012 for US tax reasons. The share price on the date of exercise was  12.695.

All-employee share plans
In order to encourage share ownership, the 
Company currently provides two all-employee 
UK HMRC approved share plans for its 
UK employees.
Share Incentive Plan
Two elements of the SIP operated during 
2012: the Partnership Shares Plan and the 
Flex Shares Plan.
(a) Partnership shares
Eligible employees are offered the opportunity 
to buy Company shares from pre-tax earnings 
as part of a regular share purchase plan. Shares 
are currently purchased every six months using 
employees' accumulated deductions and are 
placed in trust.
(b) Flex shares
Flex share allocations were made to all eligible 
employees as part of the UK flexible benefits 
plan. Flex share allocations are awarded up to 
a maximum value of  3 000 (statutory limit) 
to all eligible employees in the UK who accept 
their allocation.
Sharesave Plan
From 2008, grants have been made under the 
Sharesave Plan 2008. The plan enables eligible 
employees to acquire Company shares 
with the proceeds of a monthly savings 
contract. The contract period is three years.

award is exercised. The current maximum UK withholding is 52%. In the case of market value options, it is also stated before the 
sale of any shares to fund the exercise price.
(b) Market value options include options granted under the Company Share Option Scheme up to September 2007 and also include 
sharesave options outstanding and not yet matured as at 31 December 2012. The exercise price of these options was set at 80% 
of the market value of a share at the invitation date.
(c) Awards in the form of nil-cost options are made to eligible UK employees under the LTIP , DBP and VBDP
The following table shows the Executive Directors' interest in ordinary shares, as required

(a) Interests in ordinary shares includes ordinary shares acquired pursuant to the BG Group SIP .
On 14 February 2013, Martin Houston acquired a further 1 051 shares on the exercise of an option 
granted to him under the BG Group Sharesave Plan.
As at 20 March 2013, the Executive Directors' interests in the ordinary share capital of the Company 
represent less than 1% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company.
The closing price of an ordinary share on 31 December 2012 was  10.12. The range during the year 
was from  15.47 (high) to  10.00 (low). All market price figures are derived from the Daily Official 
List of the London Stock Exchange.
Shareholding guidelines
The Committee has adopted guidelines 
for Executive Directors, GEC members and 
certain other senior employees to encourage 
substantial long-term share ownership. 
These specify that, over a period of five years 
from the date of appointment, Executive 
Directors should build up, and then retain, 
a holding of shares with a value equivalent 
to 200% of base salary. The required holding 
for other members of the GEC is 100% of base 
salary and for certain other senior employees 
is 50% of base salary. The guidelines require 
that, in relation to Performance Share and 
Group Share Awards under the LTIP and DBP 
awards, vested shares (net of tax) should be 
retained by the individual until the required 
shareholding level is reached.
The chart below sets out the percentage 
of base salary held in shares by each of 
the Executive Directors as compared with 
the guidelines. The chart also shows for other 
members of the GEC and senior employees 
the average actual shareholding as a 
percentage of base salary.
(a) Under the shareholding guidelines, vested nil-cost 
option awards under the LTIP , VBDP and DBP are 
included. They are included net of the withholding 
for tax and social security which would have been 
made had they been exercised at the year end.  
For UK employees, the withholding applied is the  
current UK maximum of 52%.
(b) Chris Finlayson's compliance with the guidelines 
at 31 December 2012 is measured using his base 
salary at that point,  610 000.

(a) The Directors' pension contributions were made via a  salary sacrifice' system under which the Company made contributions on behalf of each Director and reduced their salary by a corresponding amount.
(b) Actual increase.
(c) Increase net of price inflation of 5.6%.
(d) The transfer values shown at the end of 2011 and 2012 represent the value of each Executive Director's accrued pension based on total service completed to the relevant date. The accrued pensions 
are the amounts to which the Executive Directors would have been entitled had they left service at the relevant date. The transfer values are calculated in accordance with the requirements of 
The Occupational Pension Scheme (Transfer Values) (Amendment) Regulations 2008. The increases in transfer values in the year differ from those reported in the Executive Directors' remuneration 
table on page 67, which have been calculated in accordance with the proposed BIS calculation basis. This is because of the different methods used.
Historical TSR performance
The graph below shows the growth in value of a 
hypothetical  100 holding invested over five years 
in each of BG Group shares, the FTSE 100 index and 
the 2012 LTIP index of oil and gas industry peers.
The FTSE 100 was chosen as this is a recognised 
broad equity market index of which BG Group 
is a member.
(The calculations are in accordance with the 
Large & Medium-Sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts & Reports) Regulations 2008.)
Dilution
The Association of British Insurers has published 
guidelines relating to the disclosure of commitments 
to issue new shares or re-issue treasury shares 
under a company's share-based schemes. In the 
event that all options and awards outstanding as 
at 31 December 2012 under BG Group's LTIP vest 
(under which awards are planned to be satisfied 
by the re-issue of treasury shares or by the issue 
of new shares), and all Company Share Option 
Scheme (CSOS) options (under which options 
are currently satisfied by the issue of new shares) 
are exercised, the resulting issue of new shares 
and re-issue of treasury shares would amount 
to 0.84% of the issued ordinary share capital 
(excluding treasury shares) at that date.
The exercise of options under BG Group's 
Sharesave Plan 2008 is satisfied by the issue 
of new shares. If the total number of options 
outstanding under these plans as at 31 December 
2012 had been exercised on that date, the 
resultant issue of shares would have represented 
0.05% of the total ordinary share capital 
(excluding treasury shares) then in issue.
Partnership and Flex Share awards made 
under the SIP during 2012 were satisfied by 
the re-issue of treasury shares. These awards 
represented 0.01% of the issued ordinary 
share capital (excluding treasury shares) 
as at 31 December 2012.
The Company's intention is to continue 
to satisfy the future exercise of options 
and vesting of awards under the above share 
plans by the issue of new shares and re-issue 
of treasury shares as described above. As of 
31 December 2012, the BG Group Employee Share 
Trust held 3 071 566 shares and the BG Group 
New Employee Share Trust held 414 shares.
External appointments
To broaden the experience of Executive 
Directors, they are able to accept one external 
appointment as a non-executive director of 
another company provided that permission 
is sought from the Board in advance. Any 
external appointment must not conflict with 
the Director's duties and commitments to 
BG Group. Any fees from such appointments 
may be retained by the individual Executive 
Director. The former Chief Executive, Sir Frank 
Chapman, was appointed as a non-executive 
director of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc on 
10 November 2011 and he receives an annual 
fee of  75 000 in connection with this 
appointment. None of the other Executive 
Directors currently holds any non-executive 
director appointment.
Pensions
Fabio Barbosa and Chris Finlayson do not accrue 
any entitlement to post-retirement benefits 
and receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension 
contributions calculated at a rate of 30% of base 
salary. The amounts paid in 2012 are set out 
in the remuneration table on page 67.
Sir Frank Chapman and Martin Houston were 
members of the BG Pension Scheme (BGPS) 
and the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme 
(BGSBS) during the year. These schemes 
provide pensions on a defined benefit 
basis. The BGPS is a funded, UK-registered 
pension scheme and the BGSBS is an unfunded, 
unregistered pension scheme. Sir Frank 
Chapman and Martin Houston elected 
 enhanced protection' with effect from 6 April 
2006, which limits the benefits provided 
by the BGPS.
The basis on which post-retirement benefits 
are calculated for Sir Frank Chapman and Martin 
Houston has not changed during the year. Sir Frank 
Chapman receives an accrual of benefits designed 
to target a pension of two-thirds of his final 
12 months' salary on retirement from BG Group 
at age 60. Martin Houston accrues pension 
at the rate of 1/60 of his final 12 months' salary 
for each year of pensionable service. Pensions 
in payment are normally increased in line with 
retail price inflation. An adult dependant's 
pension is payable on death in service, equal to 
two-thirds of that payable to the BGPS member 
including potential service. On death in retirement, 
an adult dependant's pension is payable equal 
to two-thirds of the member's pension prior 
to exchanging any of it for a cash lump sum.
Like other members of the BGPS, neither 
Sir Frank Chapman nor Martin Houston can 
normally claim an immediate pension before 
age 60 on a non-actuarially reduced basis 
unless they have left service as a result 
of redundancy when over the age of 50 or 
in the event of incapacity. In addition, like other 
members of the BGPS that have attained 
age 55 and completed 10 years' service, they 
may request an unreduced pension but this 
is only payable where the Company expressly 
agrees to payment on this basis.
A provision has been made in the Company's 
accounts in respect of the obligations for 
unfunded post-retirement benefits.
As set out in the Policy section on page 63, 
subject to the outcome of statutory employee 
consultation, the Company plans to close 
the BGPS and BGSBS to future accrual with 
effect from 1 December 2013.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Board aims to recruit Non-Executive Directors 
of a high calibre, with broad commercial, 
international or other relevant experience. 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed 
by the Board on the recommendation of the 
Nominations Committee. Their appointment 
is for an initial term of three years, subject 
to election by shareholders at the first AGM 
following their appointment and annual 
re-election thereafter. The terms of engagement 
of the Non-Executive Directors are set out in 
a letter of appointment.
The regular biennial review of non-executive fees 
took place during the year. The review involves 
consideration of a number of factors, including 
market movements, time commitment and 
competition for high-quality non-executive 
directors. The results of this review, which were 
effective from 1 June 2012 are summarised below.

fee with  
effect from  
1 June 2012

No change was made to the Chairmanship 
fee for the Sustainability Committee which 
remains at  20 000 per annum. Fees will 
next be reviewed in 2014.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible 
to participate in any of the Company's share 
schemes, incentive schemes or pension schemes.
To facilitate the alignment of the interests 
of the Non-Executive Directors with those 
of shareholders, the Group has put in place 
a Non-Executive Directors' share purchase 
programme through which Non-Executive 
Directors may elect to invest a proportion 
of their fees, net of tax and on a regular 
basis, to acquire BG Group shares on the 
open market. The first deductions were 
made under this programme in January 2010.
Chairman
Andrew Gould was appointed Chairman 
with effect from the conclusion of the AGM on 
16 May 2012, following the retirement of Sir 
Robert Wilson at the conclusion of that AGM. 
Andrew Gould was appointed for a three-year 
term from 16 May 2012. His fee is  725 000 
per annum and will be reviewed annually. His 
appointment is subject to annual re-election by 
shareholders at the AGM and there is no notice 
period and no provision for payment in the 
event of early termination.
