Remuneration Report
Dear Shareholder
As Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, it is my pleasure 
to submit the Remuneration report for BHP Billiton for 2002. 
The Committee operates under delegated authority from the
Group Boards to support and advise on executive remuneration
policy, set the remuneration of each executive Director and those
who report directly to the Chief Executive within the context of
that policy, and review and approve equity based share plans.
During the year the Committee has reviewed a range of
remuneration policy issues and has overseen the preparation 
of the proposed new incentive arrangements that will be
considered by shareholders at the Annual General Meetings 
on 4 November 2002.
The Committee is committed to the principles of accountability,
transparency and linking pay with performance.

Remuneration Committee
All of the members of the Committee are non-executive
Directors. The members at the date of this report are Mr John
Jackson (chairman), Mr John Ralph, Lord Renwick of Clifton 
and Dr John Schubert. Mr John Conde and Mr Derek Keys retired
from the Committee on 30 June 2002 and were replaced by 
Lord Renwick and John Schubert. The Company Secretary acts 
as secretary to the Committee.
The Committee met six times during the year . The number of
meetings attended by members of the Committee is set out on
page 61 . Throughout the year, Mr Paul Anderson, then Managing
Director and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr Brian Gilbertson,
then Deputy Chief Executive Officer, attended meetings of the
Committee at the invitation of the Chairman and provided advice
when called upon to do so. The Group Vice President Human
Resources provided advice and assistance to the Committee as
required. None of these employees were present when matters
associated with their own remuneration were being considered.
Throughout the year, the Committee made use of advice from
external professional consultants to provide various consulting
services. These were Hay Group, PricewaterhouseCoopers,
KPMG, Andersen, T owers Perrin and Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow.
The Committee complies with the Principles of Good Governance
and Code of Best Practice set out in the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority in the UK and the Listing Rules of the
Australian Stock Exchange.
The numerical disclosures in this Remuneration Report have 
been audited. 
Group remuneration policy
The Boards and the Remuneration Committee recognise that the
BHP Billiton Group operates in a global environment. T o prosper,
the Group must be able to attract, motivate and retain
internationally mobile executives.
The key principles that underpin Group remuneration policy are:
  that rewards reflect the competitive global market in which the
Group operates
  that demanding key performance indicators apply to delivering
results across the single economic entity and to a significant
portion of the total reward
  that rewards to executives be linked to the creation of value 
to shareholders
  that executives be rewarded for both financial and non-
financial performance
  that remuneration arrangements ensure equity between
executives and facilitate the deployment of human resources
around the Group.
The BHP Billiton Group reward structure combines base salary ,
short-term and long-term incentive plans and post-retirement
benefit arrangements. The cost and value of components of the
remuneration package are considered as a whole and are designed
to ensure an appropriate balance between fixed and variable
performance-related components, linked to short-term and long-
term objectives and to reflect market competitiveness. Details 
of the policy applied in each component are outlined below.
1Base salary
Base salaries are quantified by reference to the scope and 
nature of an individual's role, performance and experience. 
The Committee actively seeks market data to benchmark salary
levels. Particular consideration is given to competitive global
remuneration levels. The Committee has approved a global
alignment approach for senior executives, which is designed 
to develop globally competitive remuneration in the many
jurisdictions in which the Group operates. This ensures the base
salary policy takes account of the globally competitive market 
in which BHP Billiton operates for these employees, while
providing for equitable rewards between the various countries 
in which the Group operates.
2 Incentive plans
Following the merger of BHP Limited and Billiton Plc in June 2001,
the Remuneration Committee approved an alignment of the
existing incentive plans then in place. In so doing, the Committee
announced that it would oversee the development of a single
plan that it expected to put to shareholders for approval at the
Annual General Meetings in 2002. Details of the proposed Group
Incentive Scheme are outlined on the following page. 48
Remuneration Report continued
Long-term incentive awards were made under the plans currently
in place within the BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc
Groups in the financial year 2002. The plans were aligned for
these awards to provide similar benefits to employees regardless
of whether they were working in the BHP Billiton Limited or BHP
Billiton Plc Group. Details of the awards made and specific plans
under which they are made are set out later in this Report.
Maximum awards of 1 00 per cent of salary are made under the
plans each year . Executive employees also have the opportunity to
invest up to US$1 00 000 in the arrangements. A detailed outline
of each plan is included in note 23 of the BHP Billiton Plc Annual
Report 2002 Financial Statements and note 31 of the BHP Billiton
Limited Annual Report 2002 Combined Financial Statements.
Proposed Group Incentive Scheme
The proposed Group Incentive Scheme (GIS) is an integral part 
of BHP Billiton's overall approach to competitive performance-
based remuneration. The plan aims to reward senior executives
for meeting or exceeding their personal, Customer Sector Group
(CSG) and Group goals that are aligned to BHP Billiton's 
strategic direction.
Replica schemes will operate for both BHP Billiton Limited and 
BHP Billiton Plc executives and, if implemented, will replace 
all other plans currently in operation for these employees.
The GIS has two components - a short-term incentive and 
a long-term incentive (LTI).
The amount to be awarded to an executive under the scheme 
in any one year will be determined by reference to performance
against a set of pre-determined objectives (for executive
Directors the largest proportion of the goals relate to Group
financial measures). Once this amount is determined, it will 
be allocated between the short-term and long-term incentive
components of the scheme. The short-term incentive will be paid 
in cash (which will replace the current short-term incentive cash
award). The long-term incentive will be applied towards issuing
deferred shares. Alternatively, the Remuneration Committee may
at its discretion provide executives with the choice of receiving
options instead of all, or some, of the deferred shares. In
addition, the executive will be eligible to receive performance
shares equal to the value of deferred shares or options received.
Eligibility
Executives nominated by the Executive Committee and approved
by the Remuneration Committee will be eligible to participate in
the GIS. Participation in the GIS is in the absolute discretion of
the Remuneration Committee and will generally not apply to an
executive who is not expected to be employed by the relevant
group company at the date of the vesting of any deferred shares
granted in respect of that year, or at the commencement of the
exercise period for any options granted in respect of that year .
Bonus amount
The bonus amount awarded to an executive under the GIS in any
year will be determined by reference to specific targets (personal,
Customer Sector Group and Group) set for the previous financial
year (Performance Year). The target bonus amount will be set 
at the beginning of the Performance Year for each executive. 
The assessment of actual performance against target will be by
reference to three categories for each measure (threshold, target
and stretch). Depending on results achieved for specific goals, a
percentage of the target bonus will be awarded to the executive,
between 50 per cent (for threshold performance) and 1 50 per
cent (for maximum stretch performance). Where performance
falls below threshold levels, no bonus will be paid. 
The bonus will be allocated between short-term incentive and
long-term incentive awards.
The amount of short-term incentive will be paid in cash
following the release of the financial results for the relevant
Performance Year .
Subject to limitations that may be imposed by the Remuneration
Committee, participants will be able to choose what proportion
of options, if any, they wish to receive in lieu of deferred shares.
The available choices between options and deferred shares will
be determined by the Remuneration Committee on a year-to-year
basis, acting reasonably and in the best interests of the Group.
Deferred shares
If an executive elects to receive deferred shares, that executive
will be granted a right to receive these shares approximately
three years after the start of the Performance Year in respect 
of which the grant is made. At the end of those three years, the
shares will be issued without any further performance hurdles
having to be met. 
The number of deferred shares to be allocated to an executive
will depend on the amount of the bonus earned by the executive
as a long-term incentive in that year and the BHP Billiton share
price at the time of calculating the allocation. The BHP Billiton
share price will be calculated as the weighted average of the
prices at which BHP Billiton shares are traded on the Australian
Stock Exchange or London Stock Exchange (as appropriate) on
the five business days prior to the grant of the deferred shares. 
Option alternative
As an alternative to choosing deferred shares, an executive may
at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee be given the
choice of electing to receive share options. Options will be
granted at the same time as the deferred shares are granted and
will vest at the same time as deferred shares. The options will
have an exercise period of three years from their vesting date.
The executive will forfeit the right to these options if they have
voluntarily left the employment of the BHP Billiton Group prior 
to the vesting date.
The exercise price for the options will be determined prior to the
grant of options and will be calculated as the weighted average
of the prices at which BHP Billiton shares are traded on the
Australian or London Stock Exchange on the five business days
prior to the grant. 49
The number of options that may be granted will be based 
on the value of the long-term incentive bonus earned for the
Performance Year, and the value of the options as determined by
a Black-Scholes valuation (or other appropriate methodology) of
the option at that time and confirmed by an independent actuary
approved by the Remuneration Committee.
Performance shares
In addition to whichever alternative is chosen above, executives
will receive performance shares at the time the deferred shares
or options are granted. The vesting of performance shares is
entirely dependent on the Group meeting performance hurdles
based on total shareholder return (TSR) compared against a
group of peer companies and earnings per share (EPS) growth
targets, measured over a three-year period commencing at the
end of the Performance Year . 
The number of performance shares issued is also entirely
dependent on the executive's performance in the Performance
Year . The number of shares awarded will be equivalent in value
to the deferred shares (or options) for that particular grant,
divided by the weighted average of the prices at which BHP
Billiton shares are traded on the Australian Stock Exchange or
London Stock Exchange (as appropriate) on the five business
days prior to the issues of the rights.
Minimum shareholding
All executives participating in the GIS must satisfy a minimum
shareholding requirement, which will vary depending on their
seniority, and which will initially be set at a value that is
equivalent in value to between 50 per cent and 1 00 per cent 
of their net annual salary (calculated by reference to the top
marginal tax rate in each relevant jurisdiction). The shareholding
requirement calculation will include any vested deferred shares,
additional performance shares and any shares arising from
exercised options.
Transition year
Transition year arrangements are required to bridge the period
between the first full Performance Year of the BHP Billiton 
Group GISs and the termination of the Group's existing executive
compensation plans. Without the transition arrangements, 
no long-term incentive awards would be payable in 2002. That
would be contrary to the Group's policy of providing annual
competitive, performance-based incentives to its senior
management and to its objective of retaining those employees.
As a result, the Group proposes to grant performance shares to
those executives for the transition year, subject to achievement
of the specified performance conditions.
Under this proposal, executives would receive performance
shares under the GIS in this year . As mentioned above,
performance shares are subject to demanding performance
hurdles (benchmarked TSR determining the final vesting amount
and an EPS underpin that has to be met if any performance
shares are to vest). The proposed value of the performance
shares to be issued in the transition year are no greater than 
the total value of annual long-term incentive awards made 
under current plans.
Adjustments to pre-merger incentive plans
Last year, as part of the merger, the Australian Stock Exchange
(ASX) granted BHP Billiton Limited a limited waiver from the
Listing Rules, to the extent necessary to amend a part of the
terms of options issued under the BHP Employee Share Plan and
Performance Share Plan. This allowed the vesting period to be
brought forward so that options were exercisable immediately 
on termination, for employees who were made redundant or
terminated. The waiver applied only to employees terminated
within 1 2 months following the effective date of the merger, 
in respect of the options issued before that date.
The ASX has granted an extension to the existing waiver in
relation to the demerger and public listing of BHP Steel Limited.
The extension of the waiver enabled the terms of options issued
under the BHP Limited Employee Share Plan and Performance
Share Plan to be amended to bring forward the vesting period 
so that options were exercisable immediately on termination for
employees who were made redundant or terminated. The waiver
applied only to employees who were made redundant or
terminated through no fault of their own following the demerger
and public listing of BHP Steel Limited, prior to 31 July 2002.
3 Post-retirement benefits
BHP Billiton Plc has established non-contributory defined benefit
pension arrangements under which the executive Directors will
be entitled to a pension at normal retirement date at age 60,
equal to two-thirds of their base salary provided they have
completed 20 years service with the Group. Specific terms relating
to Mr Gilbertson's participation are detailed in section 2 below.
BHP Billiton Limited has established the BHP Billiton
Superannuation Fund for Australian participants. This provides
for defined benefit and defined contribution participation. The
defined benefit plan is no longer available to new members.
Under the defined benefit plan, members are entitled to a lump
sum benefit from the Fund at the age of 55, which is equal to 
20 per cent of the Final Average Salary for each year of
membership up to 36 years. If a member retires after the age 
of 60, it is possible to opt for a pension benefit instead of a 
lump sum benefit. The pension would be equal to 1/54th of 
Final Average Salary for each year of membership. In the event
of death in service, a lump sum benefit equal to 20 per cent of
salary for each year of membership (based on prospective 
service to age 65) will be paid. If a member leaves the Fund, 
for reasons other than death and disablement before age 55, 
the lump sum entitlement will be reduced at a rate of two per
cent per annum for each year before age 55. Salary excludes
overtime and other allowances. Final Average Salary is a three-
year average of salary calculated immediately before the
member leaves the Fund. 50

Under the defined contribution plan, the Company currently
contributes 9 per cent of salary into the superannuation fund 
for employees (until 30 June 2002 this was 8 per cent and was
subsequently increased in line with Australian superannuation
legislation). In addition, the Company will contribute additional
matching amounts where the employee makes a personal
contribution. The total contributions made are as follows:
Employee Contribution Rate Total Company Contribution Rate
3% 10%
4% 12%
5% 14%

Annual cash bonus
In addition to a base salary, executive Directors are entitled to
participate in an annual incentive plan. Under the plan for the
year ended 30 June 2002, Mr Anderson and Mr Gilbertson had 
a target bonus of 1 00 per cent and Mr Goodyear had 75 per cent
of base salary tied to the achievement of pre-determined
performance objectives. The actual bonus for the year for each
executive Director is detailed in the table of executive Directors'
emoluments.
Deferred cash bonus
Mr Gilbertson is entitled to a total deferred cash bonus of 
US$3 053 61 5 under his employment contracts with BHP Billiton 
Plc and BHP Billiton Services Jersey Limited, to be paid over a
four-year period from the completion of the merger in quarterly
instalments (subject to continued employment).
Other benefits
This includes allowances and the value of non-cash benefits
where appropriate, such as health insurance, housing, life
assurance, car allowance, tax advisory benefit and relocation
allowances. The amounts are inclusive of GST or VAT . Executive
Directors could be provided with living accommodation instead 
of all, or part of, the relocation allowance at the discretion of the
Remuneration Committee. This amount includes fringe benefits tax
where applicable. 
In addition to relocation expenses, a relocation allowance of 
US$1 50 000 was paid to Mr Goodyear following his relocation
from Australia to the UK on 21 December 2001 . Mr Goodyear will
receive two further annual payments of US$1 50 000, payable on
the first and second anniversary of his move.
Under the terms of his employment arrangements with BHP
Billiton Services Jersey Limited, Mr Brian Gilbertson occupied a
flat in London (owned by a BHP Billiton Group company) rent-
free until 6 November 2001 . On 7 April 2001 he was granted an
option to purchase the property at open market value. That
option expired on 6 October 2001 and was not renewed. 
From 7 November 2001, Mr Gilbertson paid a market rent for 
the property together with applicable services charges. The
applicable rental was set on the basis of advice from independent
property valuers. The total paid in rent and charges for the period
from 7 November 2001 to 27 June 2002 was US$1 06 007.
On 27 June 2002, Mr Gilbertson purchased the property for 
US$3 496 382. This represented the market value as advised by
independent property valuers. Some contents at the property
belonging to the vendor were also transferred to Mr Gilbertson.
The price paid for those contents was US$1 24 074 and was
determined after reference to an independent valuation.
The rental paid by Mr Gilbertson, and the prices paid by him to
acquire the property and the contents, reflect market rates and
values respectively.
From 21 September 2001, a property in Melbourne was made
available to Mr Gilbertson rent-free.
Mr Anderson was provided with a benefit following the
Remuneration Committee' s review of his remuneration and Mr
Gilbertson' s remuneration to ensure parity as stated in last year' s
Annual Report. Mr Gilbertson and Mr Goodyear are entitled to
certain benefits including medical insurance, permanent health
insurance, car allowance and the use of certain BHP Billiton Group
facilities and benefits. Mr Goodyear also receives a tax impact
allowance, which is designed to compensate him for any additional
tax payable on his personal assets as a result of his move from 
the US to Australia and subsequently the UK.

Remuneration Report continued
T ermination payments
Mr Anderson's employment contract as Managing Director and
CEO was terminated as part of the Group merger arrangements
on 1 July 2002, although he has agreed to continue as a non-
executive Director without compensation until the close of the
Annual General Meetings of BHP Billiton on 4 November 2002. 
Under his employment contract, Mr Anderson would have been
entitled to receive upon termination an amount of US$1 675 831,
which is equal to twice his annual base salary. An equivalent
amount will be paid as follows:
  a consultancy arrangement with a total value of US$1 04 739
under which Mr Anderson agrees to act as a consultant to the
Group for two years commencing at the time he ceases to be 
a Director; and 
  further payments totalling US$1 571 092.
In addition, Mr Anderson's employment contract entitled him 
to exercise those Performance Rights awarded under the original
contract that had not become exercisable, being 400 000
Performance Rights (300 000 of which became exercisable on
termination, with a notional value of US$3 464 770 using the
share price of US$5.39 per share). Although his contract entitled
him to exercise the 400 000 rights without reference to service or
performance hurdles, Mr Anderson voluntarily requested that
1 00 000 Performance Rights issued in relation to the year ended
30 June 2002 remain subject to performance conditions. 
His performance against the conditions was assessed in 
August 2002 and, as a result, all of those Performance Rights 
are now exercisable.
In total, the value of Mr Anderson's termination benefits was
US$5 1 40 601 .
Mr McNeilly's employment contract was terminated on 
31 December 2001 . Mr McNeilly received a termination payment
in accordance with the Company redundancy policy, that applies
to all employees, which is based on years of service with the Group. 
The lump sum payment of US$1 740 852 included amounts in
respect of redundancy (based on years of service), long service
leave and annual leave.
Retirement benefits
The estimated benefit in respect of pensions includes contributions
payable in respect of defined contribution arrangements and
actual/notional contributions that would have been required 
to secure the defined benefit promises earned in the year .
Details of defined contribution payments made, and defined
benefit pensions entitlements earned by executive Directors
are set out in section 2 below.
Short-term share-based compensation
Mr Anderson held Performance Rights entitling him to acquire
BHP Billiton Limited shares at no cost. Those rights were issued
pursuant to the equity component of his contract of employment
and were approved by shareholders at a meeting on 26 February
1 999. During the year he became entitled to exercise 200 000
Performance Rights.
Long-term share-based compensation
The amount in respect of long-term share-based compensation
represents the estimated value of awards granted under the
long-term incentive schemes. The estimated values have been
calculated using a modified Black-Scholes option pricing
methodology. Details of outstanding awards and awards vesting
in the year , for executive Directors, are set out in the tables below.
Share awards granted 
The share awards granted show the number of Performance
Rights for participants in the Performance Share Plan, Restricted
Shares for participants in the Restricted Share Scheme, Share
Awards under the Bonus Equity Share Plan and Committed and
Matching Awards granted for participants in the Co-Investment
Plan and Medium T erm Incentive Scheme.
Each of these awards constitutes a right to a share issued by 
a trustee of a special purpose trust, and requires the trustee to
acquire a BHP Billiton share on behalf of the executive, upon
fulfilment of prescribed performance hurdles. Full details of each
of these share plan arrangements are included in note 23 of the
BHP Billiton Plc Annual Report 2002 Financial Statements and
note 31 of the BHP Billiton Limited Annual Report 2002
Combined Financial Statements.
2 Retirement benefits of executive Directors
The following table sets out the pension benefit entitlements of
the individual executive Directors who held office during the year
ended 30 June 2002. The basis upon which the table has been
prepared is to set out the amount of increase in the accrued
annual pension payable at normal retirement age (65), before
commutation, to which the executive Director has become
entitled during the current year .

ANNUAL PENSION ENTITLEMENTS UPON REACHING RETIREMENT AGE 53
Mr Gilbertson
BHP Billiton Plc and BHP Billiton Services Jersey Limited have
established non-contributory defined benefit pension
arrangements under which Mr Gilbertson will be entitled to 
a pension on retirement, equal to two-thirds of Pensionable
Salary for service completed with the Group to 29 June 2001 
plus an additional pension of 1/30th of Pensionable Salary for
each year of service completed after 29 June 2001 (with complete
days counted proportionately). The total pension will not exceed
1 00 per cent of Pensionable Salary . Only base salary is pensionable.
If Mr Gilbertson retires before age 60, his accrued defined
benefit pension entitlement will normally be reduced for early
payment at the rate of four per cent per annum.
In the event of death in service, a lump sum death in service
benefit of four times base salary will be paid. A spouse's pension
on death in service of two-thirds of the prospective pension will
also be paid.
In the event of the death of Mr Gilbertson while in retirement, 
a surviving spouse's pension of two-thirds of the pension in
payment, before the effect of commutation, will be paid. 
All pensions in payment will be indexed in line with the retail
price index.
Mr Anderson
Mr Anderson did not participate in a BHP Billiton Limited pension
scheme. 
Mr McNeilly
Mr McNeilly was a non-contributory member of the BHP Billiton
defined benefit Superannuation Fund mentioned above.

Salary for each year of membership up to 36 years. Mr McNeilly
achieved service in excess of 36 years. 
Mr Goodyear
Mr Goodyear does not participate in a retirement benefit plan
and receives a payment of 20 per cent of annual base salary 
in lieu.
3 Service Contracts
Mr Anderson
Mr Anderson was employed by BHP Billiton Limited under 
a fixed-term service contract that commenced on 
1 December 1998.The contract provided that the term continued
until 31 October 2003 unless the contract was terminated by 
Mr Anderson by giving not less than 60 days' written notice. 
The contract was also terminable by BHP Billiton Limited for
cause, or reason of death, disablement or protracted illness.
Mr Anderson's employment contract as Managing Director and
CEO was terminated as part of the Group merger arrangements
on 1 July 2002, although he has agreed to continue as a non-
executive Director without compensation until the close of the
Annual General Meeting of BHP Billiton Plc on 4 November 2002. 
Mr Anderson's contract provided for the following termination
entitlements:
  a payment equal to twice his annual salary as at the date of
termination
  reimbursement of reasonable relocation costs for himself and
his immediate family from Australia to the US
  the right to exercise the balance of his Performance Rights,
granted to him under the Performance Share Plan, remaining 
to be exercised under the contract, irrespective of whether he
has satisfied the relevant performance hurdles
  a period of two years following the date of termination in
which he is entitled to exercise all the options granted to him
under the Employee Share Plan, irrespective of whether he has
satisfied the relevant performance hurdles. 
These contractual arrangements were made at the
commencement of Mr Anderson's employment as competitive
practice at that time demanded. The amount of payments and
benefits awarded to Mr Anderson on termination are set out 
on page 52.
Mr Gilbertson
Mr . Gilbertson has contracts of employment with:
  BHP Billiton Plc dated 29 July 2001
  BHP Billiton Services Jersey Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary 
of BHP Billiton Plc dated 29 July 2001
  BHP Billiton Limited dated 29 June 2001
  BHP Billiton International Services Ltd, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of BHP Billiton Plc, dated 1 2 July 2001 . (Mr . Gilbertson
is currently seconded under this agreement to BHP Billiton
Executive Services Company Pty Ltd (Secondee Company)). 
Each service contract can be terminated by each company
giving 24 months' notice, provided that such notice is not given
prior to 29 June 2003. The contracts can be terminated by Mr
Gilbertson giving 1 2 months' notice, provided that such notice
does not expire prior to 29 June 2003. These contractual
arrangements were made (and disclosed) at the commencement
of the merger, in order to ensure consistency, stability and time
for succession planning in the light of the changes occurring at
chief executive level as a result of the merger .
In the event that Mr Gilbertson's employments are terminated
because of sickness, injury or other incapacity, he will be entitled
to receive the remaining instalments of his deferred bonus that
would otherwise have become payable at the end of the quarter
in which the terminations occur . If the employment is terminated
for a reason other than sickness or gross neglect of his duties,
Mr Gilbertson will be entitled to receive payments equivalent to
the lesser of the balances of the deferred bonuses that would
otherwise have become payable, in quarterly instalments or the
total sum of US$2 442 891 . 54
Remuneration Report continued
Mr Goodyear
Mr Goodyear has contracts of employment with:
  BHP Billiton Limited dated 23 March 1 999; and
  a secondment contract from BHP Billiton Limited to BHP 
Billiton Plc and BHP Billiton International Services Limited 
dated 21 December 2001 .
The service contracts can be terminated by either the Company
or Mr Goodyear providing one months' notice. In addition to the
above, should his service be terminated at the request of the
Company for any reason other than cause within the first five
years of his employment then the Company will continue to pay
his base salary until such time (to a maximum of 1 2 months) as
he obtains alternative employment.
In addition to the above, should there be a diminution of his
responsibilities or a decrease in his base salary inconsistent with
other senior officers of the Company, then within six months of
such action by the Company he may elect to resign from the
Company and the Company will continue to pay his base salary
as it existed before such action by the Company until such time
(to a maximum of 1 2 months) as he obtains alternative
employment.
In the event that Mr Goodyear's contract ends for any reason, 
he is entitled to reimbursement of reasonable relocation costs
for himself and his immediate family from his location to the US.
The Company will also reimburse the costs associated with the
sale of his overseas residence in the event these costs are not
borne by a successor employer .
Mr McNeilly
Mr McNeilly served as an executive Director on the Board. There
was no written service contract for Mr McNeilly. Mr McNeilly's
employment terminated on 31 December 2001 when he was
made redundant as a result of the BHP Billiton Limited and 
BHP Billiton Plc merger .
Mr McNeilly stepped down from the position of executive
Director of BHP Billiton Limited on 16 October 2001 . His position
as Executive Director Global Markets was made redundant
effective 31 December 2001 as a result of the merger for which
he was eligible to receive a redundancy payment. This was
calculated in accordance with BHP Billiton Limited's redundancy
policy at that time.
4 Executive Directors' interests in long-term incentive plans
and other share schemes
The following tables set out details of executive Directors'
interests in share plans including the number of shares awarded
in the financial year ended 30 June 2002.
Adjustments were made to share awards held by all employees
(including executive Directors) as a result of the public listing 
of BHP Steel Limited. These adjustments were made solely to
compensate for the capital reduction in BHP Billiton Limited 
that resulted from the demerger of BHP Steel Limited, and the
matching action of a bonus issue made by BHP Billiton Plc at 
the same time. These adjustments were made in July 2002 at 
the time of the BHP Steel Limited public listing and as such are
not factored into the awards shown below as they occurred after
the end of the financial year .
BHP Billiton Plc
Restricted Share Scheme
Following completion of the merger, the potential awards vested
in full on 20 August 2001 . The value of awards vesting has been
calculated using the share price on the date of vesting, which
was  3.1 6 7 5 although the shares may have been retained. The
share price at the end of the year was  3.36 and the highest and
lowest prices during the year were  3.92 and  2.42 respectively. 
Potential awards were made on 8 November 2001 when the
share price was  2.89.
The performance hurdles attached to the Restricted Shares
issued in November 2001 relate to a global comparator group 
of companies. The BHP Billiton Plc Group's performance in terms
of TSR is measured against this group of companies and the 
UK Retail Price Index to determine if the performance hurdles
have been achieved. Regarding the Restricted Shares that 
were issued as long-term incentives, if the hurdles are not
achieved by 30 September 2004 then 75 per cent of the
Restricted Shares lapse. The performance hurdles are measured
again at 30 September 2005 and 30 September 2006 and, if the
hurdles are not achieved, then the remaining 25 per cent of the
Restricted Shares lapse. These Restricted Shares only vest to the
extent rights under the BHP Billiton Limited Performance Share
Plan are exercisable based on those performance hurdles.
The BHP Billiton Share Ownership Trust held 659 882 Ordinary
Shares at 30 June 2002 (2001: 1 4 225 249). The executive
Directors are deemed to be interested in these shares as
beneficiaries of the trust.
At the date of this Report the number of shares subject to
potential awards were 292 576. 55
Co-Investment Plan
Following completion of the merger, the matching awards vested
in full on 20 August 2001 . The value of awards vesting has been
calculated using the share price on the date of vesting, although
the shares may have been retained. The share price at the date
of vesting was  3.1 6 7 5. The share price at the end of the year
was  3.36 and the highest and lowest prices during the year
were  3.92 and  2.42 respectively.
In the case of matching awards made under the CIP by Directors,
vesting was subject to an agreement by the executive to retain
approximately three-quarters of the shares acquired on exercise
for a period of 1 2 months, or in the case of Mr Gilbertson for
three years, following the DLC merger (subject to deductions 
to cover income and social taxes). 
On 8 November 2001, executive Directors were invited to
participate in the Co-Investment Plan.
The vesting of matching awards is determined by reference to
two performance periods. The first performance period is two
years in length and the second performance period is four years
in length. Both performance periods commence on the date the
awards were granted 8 November 2001 . The proportion of shares
subject to the award that vest at the end of the relevant
performance period will be determined by BHP Billiton Plc's
performance measured in terms of:
  total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return
of a global comparator group of companies; and
  earnings per share growth in excess of an inflationary underpin
based on the UK Retail Price Index.
If both performance hurdles are achieved at the end of the first
performance period, the corresponding number of matching
awards will vest. At this time, the participant has the option to
remain within the Plan and enter the second performance period
or leave the Plan. If the participant opts to leave the Plan at this
stage, committed shares will be released together with any
shares under the matching award that may have vested. All
remaining shares under the matching award will then lapse.
If a participant chooses to remain in the Plan, the second
performance period will be relevant and there will be an
opportunity for more shares to be awarded under the matching
award, subject to performance conditions being met at the end 
of the four-year period. Shares only vest to the extent rights vest
under BHP Billiton Limited's Medium T erm Incentive Plan.
At the date of this Report, the number of shares subject to
potential awards were 76 021 and the number of committed
shares were 24 925.
BHP Billiton Limited
Performance Share Plan
The performance hurdles attached to offers of Performance
Rights issued in November 2001 relate to a global comparator
group of companies. The BHP Billiton Limited Group's
performance in terms of TSR is measured against this group 
of companies and the Australian Consumer Price Index to
determine if the performance hurdles have been achieved.
Regarding the Performance Rights which were issued as long-
term incentives, if the hurdles are not achieved by 30 September
2004, then 75 per cent of the Performance Rights lapse. The
performance hurdles are measured again at 30 September 2005
and 30 September 2006 and, if the hurdles are not achieved,
then the remaining 25 per cent of the Performance Rights lapse.
These rights only become exercisable to the extent rights under
the BHP Billiton Plc Restricted Share Scheme are exercisable,
based on those performance hurdles. The share price at the end
of the year was A$1 0.30 and the highest and lowest prices
during the year were A$1 2.49 and A$7.87 respectively .
Mr Anderson was issued with 1 000 000 Performance 
Rights after approval by shareholders in the General Meeting 
on 26 February 1 999. The Performance Rights were subject to
performance and service conditions. Upon completion of these
conditions, each Performance Right constituted the right to
acquire 2.1 4 1 1 ordinary BHP Billiton Limited Shares. The
Performance Rights had a zero exercise price. Mr Anderson
accrued the entitlement to exercise 1 00 000 Performance Rights
per annum subject to satisfying a service condition and up to 
1 00 000 Performance Rights per annum subject to satisfying
performance targets set by the Board on an annual basis.

Remuneration Report continued
Mr Anderson's employment as an executive Director terminated
on 1 July 2002 when he became entitled to exercise his
outstanding Performance Rights other than 1 00 000 Performance
Rights that he agreed would remain in escrow (see page 52).
These Performance Rights lapse if not exercised prior to 
1 July 2004.
Mr McNeilly was issued 57 222 Performance Rights after
approval by shareholders in the General Meeting held on 
1 7 October 2000. Each Performance Right constitutes the right 
to acquire 2.0651 ordinary BHP Billiton Limited shares subject to
a performance hurdle. The Performance Rights had zero exercise
price. Mr McNeilly retired as a Director on 31 December 2001 .
These Performance Rights became exercisable upon his
retirement and Mr McNeilly exercised them on 31 May 2002
when the share price was A$1 0.80.
Employee Share Plan
Mr Anderson was issued with 1 000 000 options and Mr McNeilly
with 250 000 options under the BHP Billiton Limited Employee
Share Plan after approval by shareholders in the BHP Billiton
Limited General Meeting on 26 February 1 999. The options 
were not exercisable before 23 April 2002 and were subject to
performance hurdles. The performance hurdle related to BHP
Billiton Limited's total shareholder return relative to comparator
groups of companies. Performance against the hurdle was first
measured during the year ended 30 June 2002 and the options
became fully exercisable. The options expire on 22 April 2009.
Mr McNeilly exercised options issued to him on 23 April 1 999 
on 21 May 2002 when the share price was A$1 1 .20.
Mr Goodyear's options were granted prior to his appointment 
as executive Director . 722 785 shares under option could be
acquired through exercise at 30 June 2002.
The share price at the end of the year was A$1 0.30 and the
highest and lowest prices during the year were A$1 2.49 and
A$7.87 respectively.

Remuneration of non-executive Directors
As foreshadowed in the last annual report, a review of fees
payable to non-executive Directors was conducted during the
year . The principles that underpinned that review were that
Directors would receive one fee only for their service as 
Directors of both Companies, the aggregate of fees paid 
would be contained within the cap of US$3 million approved 
by shareholders in May 2001, and fees would be conformed so
that all Directors would receive the same base fee for service.
The Board (comprised of executive Directors with no personal
interest in the outcome) determined the revised fees that were
announced on 2 May 2002. T o assist in determining the
appropriate fees, a report was commissioned from Andersen 
to provide information on the level and mix of fees payable to 
non-executive Directors in Australia, the UK and the US.
The new remuneration rates reflect the size and complexity 
of the Group and the considerable travel burden imposed on
members of the Board, and comprise the following elements:
  a base fee of US$60 000 per annum (payable from 1 July 2001)
  a fee of US$1 000 for each meeting attended (payable from 
1 January 2002)
  a fee of US$7500 to the chairman of a Committee of the Board
(payable from 1 July 2001)
  a travel allowance of US$1 000 for air travel that is more than 
four hours but less than 1 2 hours and US$2500 where air travel
is more than 1 2 hours.
The Chairman's remuneration was fixed at four times the 
base fee for non-executive Directors. He does not receive any
additional fees for chairing the Nomination Committee, or any
Board meeting attendance fees.
The Deputy Chairman is paid a fee of US$1 50 000. As in the case
of the Chairman, no additional fees are paid for chairing the
Remuneration Committee, or for attending meetings of the
Board.
Fees are denominated in US dollars and are paid in either US
dollars, Australian dollars or UK pounds, as nominated by the
Director . 
Each non-executive Director is appointed for an indefinite term,
subject to periodic re-election by the shareholders. There are no
provisions in any of the non-executive Director's appointment
arrangements for compensation payable on early termination 
of their directorship.

Amount paid on retirement at 30 June 2002. These payments were funded in part by superannuation contributions described on page 50.
In 1 989, the shareholders of BHP Limited (now BHP Billiton
Limited) approved a Retirement Plan under which non-executive
Directors received a payment on retirement. The payment was
calculated by reference to years of service. The existence of plans
such as this have been a common feature of remuneration
arrangements for non-executive Directors in Australia and 
BHP Billiton has always sought and obtained shareholder
approval for its plans.
At the time of the merger, the Boards recognised that best
practice had moved away from such plans and it was agreed that
no new entrants would be admitted. This included the Directors
of Billiton Plc who did not join the plan, notwithstanding that
they had become Directors of BHP Billiton Limited under the
terms of the merger . The Board has resolved to formally close the
plan and to continue it only for so long as the current
participants remain on the Board. In so doing, all of the current
participants have voluntarily agreed to limit the quantum of
benefits that will accrue to those calculated by reference to the
old remuneration rate of A$1 1 0 000 (with the exception of the
Chairman whose former rate is A$440 000), adjusted only by the
same percentage as any increase in the new remuneration rates.
At the date of this report, the remaining participants in the 
Plan are Mr Don Argus, Mr Michael Chaney, Mr David Crawford, 
Dr David Jenkins, Mr John Ralph and Dr John Schubert. The Board
does not believe that the continued participation of these non-
executive Directors in the Plan compromises their independence. 
On retirement from office on 30 June 2002, Mr Ben Alberts 
and Mr John Conde were both paid retirement allowances. 
Mr John Ralph will retire at the conclusion of the Annual General
Meetings this year and will be paid a retirement allowance 
at that time.
The amounts paid to the non-executive Directors who retired
from office during the year and the amounts accrued in favour 
of participating non-executive Directors as at 30 June 2002, are
set out in the table below.
Aggregate remuneration of the Directors of BHP Billiton in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles is set out in the
