1. Remuneration Committee
1. 1 Role 
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) operates under
the delegated authority of the Boards of BHP Billiton Plc and 
BHP Billiton Limited (hereafter referred to collectively as the
Board) to provide support and advice on executive remuneration
policy, to make recommendations to the Board on the
remuneration of each executive Director, to set the remuneration
for those who report directly to the Chief Executive Officer, and
to review and approve equity-based incentive plans. 
The activities of the Committee are governed by terms of
reference, a copy of which is available on the BHP Billiton website
at www.bhpbilliton.com/bb/aboutUs/governance.jsp. 
The Committee is committed to the principles of accountability,
transparency and to ensuring that remuneration arrangements
demonstrate a clear link between reward and performance. 47 BHP BILLITON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2003        >
1.2 Membership
All of the members of the Committee are non-executive
Directors. At the date of this Report the members are Dr John
Buchanan (Chairman), Dr David Jenkins, Lord Renwick and 
Dr John Schubert. 
Mr John Jackson retired as Chairman of the Committee following
the annual general meetings held on 4 November 2002. Mr John
Ralph also retired from the Committee following the annual
general meetings.
Dr David Jenkins joined the Committee on 28 November 2002
and Dr John Buchanan on 1 February 2003. Dr Buchanan was
appointed Chairman with effect from 20 March 2003.
The Company Secretary, Ms Karen Wood, acts as secretary to the
Committee.
1.3 Meetings
The Committee met eight times during the year . The Directors'
attendance at Committee meetings held during the period of
their membership is set out in the table on page 65 of this
Report.
1.4 Advisors
Throughout the year , the Committee has taken advice from the Group
Chairman, Mr Don Argus, the Chief Executive Officer , Mr Charles
Goodyear , and the Group Vice President Human Resources, 
Mr Ian Fraser . None of these people were present when matters
associated with their own remuneration were considered.
Group Human Resources has made use of the services of external
advisors from time to time on matters relating to remuneration.
Information relevant to matters being considered by the
Committee has been made available to the Committee. 
The Committee did not directly retain any advisors. 
The table below lists those advisors who have been retained on
behalf of the Group throughout the year . Where services have
been provided by Group auditors, those services have been
provided pursuant to the policy relating to the provision of non-
audit services, a copy of which is available on the BHP Billiton 
website at www.bhpbilliton.com/bbContentRepository/
AboutUs/Governance/OtherServicesPolicy.pdf. Details of the
auditors' costs associated with those services are set out in 
note 7 to the financial statements on page 1 00 of this Report.
2. Remuneration policy
The Committee recognises that the Group operates in a global
environment and that its performance depends on the quality 
of its people. T o prosper, the Group must be able to attract,
motivate and retain highly skilled executives willing to work
around the world.
The key principles that underpin Group remuneration policy are:
  competitive rewards are provided to attract and retain
executive talent on a global basis
  demanding key performance indicators apply to delivering
results across the Group and are applied to a significant
portion of the total reward
  rewards to executives are linked to the creation of value to
shareholders
  the criteria used to assess and reward executives include
financial and non-financial measures of performance
  remuneration arrangements should ensure equity between
executives and should facilitate the deployment of human
resources around the Group, and 
  severance payments due to executives on termination are
limited to pre-established contractual arrangements which do
not commit the Group to making any unjustified payments in
the event of non-performance.
The remuneration policy assists the Group to achieve its business
strategy and objectives. The Committee recognises that, while
remuneration is a key factor in recruiting the right people, it is
not the only factor . The Group's values, and its ability to provide
interesting and challenging career opportunities, also play an
important part.

Design of Retirement Savings Program BHP Billiton international assignees 3. Remuneration structure
Since the merger, significant progress has been made to align the
contract terms, remuneration and benefits for executives. While
legacy differences remain,resulting in discrepancies in the contract
terms and remuneration of executives, the policy is that whenever
opportunities arise, the Group will update service contracts to
reflect current best practice and to standardise terms of
employment for employees at comparable levels across the Group.
It is the Group's policy that service contracts for senior
executives, including the Chief Executive Officer, be unlimited in
term but capable of termination on 1 2 months' notice and that
the Group retain the right to terminate the contract immediately,
by making a payment equal to 1 2 months' pay in lieu of notice. 
Some executives (but not the Chief Executive Officer) have
existing service contracts that contain notice periods that exceed
1 2 months. The Committee will limit notice periods to 1 2 months
in all future contracts for executives, unless exceptional
circumstances exist. 
The BHP Billiton remuneration structure contains three components: 
(1) base salary and benefits (where applicable)
(2) retirement benefits 
(3) short and long-term incentive arrangements. 
The cost and value of these components are considered as a
whole. They are designed to ensure that the right balance is
struck between fixed and variable remuneration. Variable
remuneration is remuneration that is tied to performance, and
therefore is at risk. BHP Billiton's remuneration policy is to pay 
at the median level of remuneration for target performance and
at the upper quartile level for exceptional performance.
Details of each component are set out below.
3. 1 Base salary and benefits
Base salaries are quantified by reference to the scope and nature
of the role and an individual's performance and experience.
Market data is used to benchmark salary levels off a single global
scale, adjusted for local conditions. Particular consideration is
given to competitive global remuneration levels. 
In addition to base salary, selected executives receive benefits
including health insurance, relocation costs, life assurance, car
allowances and tax advisory services. All benefits received by 
the executive Directors and the five executive officers for whom
remuneration is reported are outlined in sections 4 and 6 of this
Report.
3.2 Retirement benefits
A range of retirement and death-in-service benefits operate
within the Group. Those benefits reflect the different statutory
entitlements in the jurisdictions in which BHP Billiton operates,
local market practice and the manner in which this was applied
by BHP Limited and Billiton Plc prior to the merger . Where
possible, benefits have been standardised following the merger,
although a number of legacy positions remain, particularly in
relation to the type of pension or superannuation schemes
available. In some instances this has given rise to a discrepancy
in entitlements between executives at similar levels. The
Committee has taken steps to address those discrepancies since
the merger and has made considerable progress. Some of those
discrepancies will, however, continue while the affected
employees remain in service.
Some retirement benefits are to be delivered under defined
benefit plans. The Committee considers that these types of plans
could place an unreasonable financial burden on the Group. For
this reason, the Committee has resolved that no new members
will be admitted to the remaining defined benefit plans, save in
exceptional circumstances. The Committee recognises that it
cannot move to close the remaining plans while those plans 
have current employees as members.
Details on the retirement benefits applicable to the current
executive Directors and to the executives for whom remuneration
information is reported are set out on pages 55, 57 and 60 of 
this Report.
3.3 Short and long-term incentives
Long and short-term incentive arrangements are determined
under the Group Incentive Scheme (GIS). The GIS was approved
by shareholders in November 2002 and is an integral part of 
BHP Billiton's approach to competitive performance-based
remuneration. The GIS is designed to drive sustainable,
transparent performance in the long term and reflects the
Group's commitment to crucial operational targets.
The GIS represents the variable component of remuneration and
rewards executives for meeting or exceeding key performance
indicators that are set each year and aligned to BHP Billiton's
strategic framework. The percentage of total remuneration that 
is variable differs according to the level of the employee. 
The GIS replaced the previous short, medium and long-term
incentive plans for senior executives. Some of those previous
plans have not yet reached the end of their performance periods.
Subject to performance conditions, awards may still vest under
those plans. In some cases awards have already vested but the
period for exercising those awards has not yet expired. The plans
are detailed on page 52 of this Report.
The GIS has been designed for senior executives and is controlled
by the Committee. Participation requires the approval of the
Committee. Throughout the period of participation, employees
are required to hold a minimum number of BHP Billiton shares.
The number required to be held varies according to the seniority
of the employee.
3.3. 1. Group Incentive Scheme
A summary of the operation of the GIS is set out on the following
page. A copy of the rules of the GIS is available on the BHP
Billiton website, www.bhpbilliton.com/bbContentRepository/
Events/BHPBillitonLtdGIS.pdf and www.bhpbilliton.com/

Step 1 At the beginning of each financial year, the Committee
approves key performance indicators (KPIs) for the Chief
Executive Officer and the people who report to him. These KPIs
contain a mix of Group measures, individual business measures
and personal measures. In every case, these include health,
safety and environmental measures, either at Group or individual
business level.
The Group measures relate to overall corporate performance and
are the same for each employee, although different weightings
apply to employees at different levels. Individual business
measures reflect the objectives for the different businesses, 
while personal measures are tailored to reflect the performance
expectations for individual employees. In all cases the KPIs have
been designed to ensure that they are transparent, challenging
and consistent with the Group's strategic framework and
business value drivers, details of which were released to
shareholders in April 2002.
The Group measures for the year ended 30 June 2003 are set out
in section 3.3.3 below.
Step 2 At the end of each financial year the actual performance
of the Group, the individual businesses and each participant is
measured and a decision is made in relation to whether the KPIs
have been met and if so, at what level.
There are three levels of performance against each of 
the KPIs: Performance at threshold (i.e. the minimum necessary
to qualify for any reward); target (where the performance
requirements have been met); and stretch (where performance 
is exceeded). The achievement against each KPI is expressed as 
a percentage. The percentages will range from zero per cent
where the participant fails to meet threshold performance and 
1 50 per cent where performance is at the stretch level. The overall
percentage achievement is then multiplied by a proportion of the
executive's salary (depending on level of seniority) to deliver the
actual amount. The actual percentages that apply to the
executive Directors are set out in section 4.
In order to identify and measure the variables that executives 
are able to manage and influence, adjustments are made to
commodity prices and exchange rate fluctuations. In practice 
this is calculated by excluding 80 per cent of the variation against
the budget estimate.
Step 3 Once the performance level against the KPIs has been
assessed, the amount of the reward is calculated. Half of that
amount is paid to the participant in cash. This represents the
short-term incentive component. The other half is retained and
used as the basis for calculating the long-term incentive
component.
Step 4 The long-term incentive component is converted into
shares, known as Deferred Shares, at the market price of the
underlying shares on the date of grant. The Committee may, in its
absolute discretion, give participants the right to take some or all
of the value of this component in the form of Options. The
number of Options granted will be derived from the market price
at the date of grant.
Operation of the Group Incentive Scheme 50 > BHP BILLITON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2003
Remuneration Report continued
The Committee will allow a participant to take Options instead 
of Deferred Shares where it is satisfied that the grant is consistent
with the remuneration policy and does not undermine the
objective of aligning the interests of participants with shareholders.
Step 5 At the same time as half the bonus amount is converted
into Deferred Shares or Options, the Group will match that
amount in the form of a Performance Share award.
One Deferred Share, Option or Performance Share entitles the
participant to one ordinary share in BHP Billiton.
Step 6 Executives must retain the Deferred Shares (or Options 
if taken in lieu) for two years from the date of grant and cannot
exercise the Deferred Shares or Options during that period. 
At the end of that period, those Deferred Shares or Options are
released. Participants will lose the Deferred Shares or Options if
they voluntarily leave BHP Billiton before the expiration of the
two-year period. This is designed to encourage participants to
remain in the employment of the Group. Subject to the
circumstances under which the participant otherwise leaves, 
the Committee retains some discretion in relation to Deferred
Shares, Options and Performance Shares held by the participant
but which have not yet vested. 
Options can be exercised over a three-year period from the date
on which they become exercisable.
Step 7 The Performance Shares are subject to performance
hurdles established by the Committee from time to time. The
current hurdles are based on BHP Billiton's T otal Shareholder
Return (TSR) compared to a group of peer companies and its
Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth targets measured over a three-
year period. These measures are designed to encourage
participants to focus on the long-term performance of the Group.
The applicable TSR and EPS measures are explained in more
detail in section 3.3.2 below.
3.3.2 Group Incentive Scheme - Transition Year
At the annual general meetings in 2002, shareholders approved
arrangements that were required to bridge the period between
the first full performance year of the GIS (the year ended 
30 June 2003) and the cessation of awards under the Group's
previous executive incentive plans. Without those transition
arrangements, no long-term incentive awards could have been
made in 2002. No short-term incentives were paid under the GIS
for the Transition Year as executives remained eligible for short-
term incentives under the former BHP Billiton plans. The
Committee considered that the most appropriate transition
arrangements were to allocate Performance Shares to
participants that were subject to performance hurdles to be
measured in 2005.
These performance hurdles are based on EPS growth and
comparative TSR during the period from 1 July 2002 to 
30 June 2005 (the Performance Period). Both the EPS growth
targets and minimum TSR targets will need to be reached in 
order for the Performance Shares to vest. 
The percentage of shares that will vest depends on the
performance of the Group against the peer group companies. 
The vesting schedule is:
TSR Percentile % of Performance Shares that will vest
85th - 100th percentile 100
80th< 85th percentile 90
75th < 80th percentile 80
70th < 75th percentile 70
65th< 70th percentile 65
60th< 65th percentile 60
55th < 60th percentile 50
50th< 55th percentile 40
Less than 50th percentile None
The EPS growth targets will be satisfied if the compound EPS
growth for the Group during the Performance Period is at least
equal to the greater of the increase in the Australian Consumer
Price Index or the increase in the UK Retail Price Index, plus 
two per cent per annum, over the Performance Period.
The level of vesting of the Performance Shares will depend on 
the TSR achieved by BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc
compared to peer group companies over the Performance Period.
The vesting schedule is set out above. If the TSR calculations for
BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc result in one entity
receiving a higher TSR percentile than the other, both groups 
will be deemed to have achieved the lower TSR percentile.
EPS growth is used as a performance hurdle because it provides 
a measure of the Group's earnings growth. TSR is recognised as
one of the best indicators of shareholder return.
External consultants have been retained to assess whether the
performance hurdles have been met, using established parameters
which take into account adjustments for mergers or takeovers.
These calculations are to be reviewed by the external auditors at
the time of vesting. 
The peer group of companies against which BHP Billiton's TSR
performance is measured are:
  Alcan   Marathon Oil Co
  Alcoa   Newmont Mining
  Alumina   Noranda
  Anglo American   Phelps Dodge
  Barrick Gold   Placer Dome
  Companhia Vale do Rio Doce   Rio Tinto

3.3.3 Group Incentive Scheme - Performance Year 
1 July 2002 - 30 June 2003
The first full year of the GIS is that ended 30 June 2003.
As described in section 3.3. 1 above, the KPIs for the year were
based on Group, individual business and personal measures. 
The Group measures in financial year 2003 required performance
in reducing operating costs; delivering against specific health,
safety and environment targets including a specified classified
injury frequency rate; delivering synergies arising from the
merger of BHP Limited and Billiton Plc; and achieving specified
levels of Return On Capital Employed, EBIT Shareholder Value
Added, free cash flow and Shareholder Value Added.
The different levels of performance achieved in relation to each
of these measures were as follows: 
Group KPIs Level of performance achieved
Health, safety and environment Between target and stretch
Reduction in operating costs Stretch
Realisation of merger synergies Stretch
Return on Capital Employed Stretch
EBIT Shareholder Value Added Between target and stretch
Free cash flow Stretch
Shareholder Value Added Stretch
3.3.4 Other long-term incentive schemes
The GIS replaced all other incentive plans used by BHP Billiton,
and no awards have been made under those plans since the
introduction of the GIS. Some of the plans implemented before
the introduction of the GIS remain in operation. The last of the
awards made under these plans will expire in 201 1 .
A summary of the incentive plans under which awards to
Directors and senior executives are still to vest is set out in 
section 3.4. A comparison of the Performance Shares awarded
under the transitional arrangements, described in section 3.3.2
above, is also set out. Full details of the plans are contained in
note 23 to the financial statements on page 1 20 of this Report.

Mr Goodyear has a single service contract with BHP Billiton
Limited and BHP Billiton Plc. The contract does not contain a
fixed term and can be terminated by the Group on 1 2 months'
notice. Mr Goodyear is entitled to terminate the contract on 
three months' notice. The Group may immediately terminate the
contract by paying Mr Goodyear 1 2 months' base salary in lieu of
notice. In addition to base salary, Mr Goodyear is paid an amount
in lieu of any contribution by the Group to a superannuation or
pension fund. This amount is described as  Retirement benefits'
in the table in section 4. 1 .2 below. This amount is also payable
where a payment is made in lieu of notice.
Any entitlement Mr Goodyear might have in relation to short and
long-term incentives is covered by the GIS (details of which are
set out in section 3.3. 1). The rules of that Scheme outline the
circumstances in which Mr Goodyear (and any other participant)
would be entitled to receive any Deferred Shares, Options or
Performance Shares that had been granted but which had not
vested at the date of termination. The rules of the GIS also outline
the circumstances in which Mr Goodyear would be entitled to a cash
bonus payment for the performance year in which he leaves the
Group. Those circumstances depend on the reason for his departure. 
The rules of the GIS confer on the Committee discretion in
relation to the entitlements of an employee on termination in
some circumstances. One such circumstance is where the
employee is classified as an  other leaver'. This will include
situations where the employee does not resign or is not
terminated for cause. In an effort to provide the Group, its
shareholders and Mr Goodyear with as much certainty as
possible in relation to his entitlements at termination, the
Committee has considered what Mr Goodyear's entitlements
might be if he and the Group reached a mutual decision to
depart. The Committee has resolved that, providing Mr Goodyear
has served as Chief Executive Officer for no less than three years,
he would be entitled to:
  any Deferred Shares or Options that had been granted but 
were not exercisable at the date of departure. The Committee
recognises that the performance measures for the grant of
these Deferred Shares or Options have already been met, save
for the requirement that they be held for two years from the
date of grant. The Committee believes that a mutual decision 
to depart would override that additional requirement to hold
these Shares or Options for the balance of the two-year period.
  a cash bonus for the year in which the departure takes place
that has been calculated according to the performance of 
Mr Goodyear and the Group for that year, and pro-rated back 
to reflect the actual period of service in that year .
  a right to retain Performance Shares that have been granted
but that are not exercisable, pending satisfaction of
performance conditions. The number of Performance Shares
Mr Goodyear will be permitted to retain will be reduced to
reflect his period of service. These will then only become
exercisable if the performance conditions are ultimately met.
These entitlements would not arise if Mr Goodyear's contract was
terminated for cause or if Mr Goodyear resigned. Details of how
the GIS would operate in those circumstances are set out in the
rules, a copy of which is available on the website at www.
bhpbilliton.com/bbContentRepository/Events/BHPBillitonLtdGIS.pdf.
Where the Committee retains discretion in relation to the award
of any long or short-term incentives, the rules of the GIS require
the Committee to exercise that discretion in good faith and
acting reasonably.

Deferred Shares
Details on Deferred Shares are included under the GIS on pages 49 to 50 of this Report. The actual Deferred Shares will be awarded to Mr Goodyear subject to
approval by shareholders at the annual general meetings in 2003. Mr Goodyear can elect to receive Options instead of Deferred Shares, or a combination of
both. 
(2)
Other benefits
Mr Goodyear is entitled to certain benefits including medical insurance, health insurance, and the use of certain Group facilities. Mr Goodyear also received a tax
impact allowance, relocation allowances and expenses, professional fees and car allowance. The tax impact allowance was designed to compensate him for any
additional tax payable on his personal assets as a result of his move from the US to Australia and subsequently to the UK.

Retirement benefits comprise cash gratuity paid in lieu of retirement benefits during the year .

Long-term share-based compensation
The amount in respect of long-term share-based compensation represents the estimated value of awards granted under the long-term incentive schemes. The
estimated value has been calculated using a modified Black-Scholes option pricing methodology. Details of outstanding awards and awards vesting in the year
are set out in the two tables below.
(5)
In accordance with UK GAAP , 1 00 per cent of the value of Deferred Shares earned during the 2003 year is included in remuneration in the column headed 
 Value of Deferred Shares'. Under Australian GAAP , such remuneration is to be included over the vesting period (in this case, the three years from 1 July 2002 
to 30 June 2005). The column headed  Adjustment' represents this difference. Hence, the addition of the columns headed  Value of Deferred Shares' and
 Adjustment' represents the remuneration associated with Deferred Shares under Australian GAAP .

T otal remuneration paid to Mr Goodyear while a Director of the Group during 2002 was US$1 285 402. This was made up of base salary US$408 61 8, annual
cash bonus of US$562 330 and other benefits of US$31 4 454.

The market price of BHP Billiton Limited shares at 30 June 2003
was A$8.64.
The highest and lowest market prices during 2003 were A$1 0.50
(9 July 2002) and A$8.28 (20 May 2003) respectively.
Mr Goodyear was invited to participate in the GIS for the year ended
30 June 2003. The target cash bonus amount was 70 per cent of
adjusted salary . The Group financial measures represented a 
70 per cent weighting of Mr Goodyear' s total performance
measures. Mr Goodyear had an above target level of performance
and achieved 91 . 1 per cent of adjusted salary . 
The cash bonus amount represents half of the total bonus
amount in accordance with the rules of the GIS. The actual
amount is detailed in the table of remuneration in section 4. 1 .2.
The remaining half of the total bonus will be awarded to 
Mr Goodyear in Deferred Shares and/or Options, subject to the
approval of shareholders at the annual general meetings in 2003.
These Deferred Shares and/or Options will vest in August 2005,
subject to Mr Goodyear still being in employment with the Group
at the time of vesting. In addition to the Deferred Shares and/or
Options, the Group will also match this half of the total bonus
amount in the form of a Performance Share award. The vesting of
these Performance Shares will be subject to performance hurdles,
and will not be eligible for vesting until August 2006.
The Remuneration Committee has set a target cash bonus
amount of 70 per cent of salary for the year ended 30 June 2004.
The Group financial measures will represent a 75 per cent
weighting of his total performance measures. The remaining 
25 per cent relates to personal performance measures which
include risk management and people development.
Assessed at the  target' level of performance, 50.9 per cent of 
Mr Goodyear's remuneration is related to his performance and is
therefore  at risk'.
4. 1.4 Retirement benefits
Mr Goodyear's remuneration includes a payment in lieu of any
contribution by the Group to a superannuation or pension fund.
That payment is fixed at an annual contribution rate of 48 per
cent of base salary. Mr Goodyear may elect to have the sum paid
into a superannuation or pension fund or he may elect, instead,
to defer receipt, subject to the rules of a Retirement Savings Plan
that has been established for this purpose. Those rules allow 
Mr Goodyear to accumulate these annual payments and to defer
receipt until after he retires from the Group. The Plan allows 
Mr Goodyear to establish retirement savings arrangements that
best meet his needs. 
In the event of death in service, a death-in-service benefit of four
times base salary will be paid. The overall annual pension payable
to his spouse at the time of his death, until she dies, will be equal
to two-thirds of one-thirtieth of Mr Goodyear's pensionable salary
at date of death, for each year of service from 1 January 2003 to
his normal retirement date. Periods of service where Mr Goodyear
received his retirement benefit in the form of the cash gratuity will
be disregarded for the purpose of calculating any pension amount.
4.2 Mr Miklos (Mike) Salamon
4.2. 1 Service contracts
Mr Salamon has contracts of employment with BHP Billiton Plc
and BHP Billiton Services Jersey Limited, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of BHP Billiton Plc.
Mr Salamon's employment agreements automatically terminate
on his sixtieth birthday. At any time prior to his sixtieth birthday
each service contract can be terminated by either the Group or
Mr Salamon providing 1 2 months' notice. The Company may
make a payment in lieu of notice equal to 1 50 per cent of base
salary. This payment reflects the market practice at the time the
terms were agreed. It is now Group policy that periods of notice
be limited to 1 2 months unless exceptional circumstances exist.
The Committee has not considered the circumstances in which 
it would exercise its discretion to allow Mr Salamon to maintain
any ongoing participation in relation to the long-term incentive
schemes in which he participates in the event of his departure.
Those entitlements, if any, will be governed by the rules of the
schemes at the date of departure.

The market price of BHP Billiton Plc shares at 30 June 2003 was
 3. 1 9.
The highest and lowest market prices during 2003 were  3.53 
(8 July 2002) and  2.47 (6 August 2002) respectively.
Mr Salamon was invited to participate in the GIS for the year
ended 30 June 2003. The target cash bonus amount was 
70 per cent of adjusted salary. The Group financial measures
represented a 50 per cent weighting of Mr Salamon's total
performance measures. Mr Salamon had an above target level of
performance and achieved 95.6 per cent of adjusted salary.
The cash bonus represents half of the total bonus amount in
accordance with the rules of the GIS. The actual amount is
detailed in the table of remuneration in section 4.2.2.
The remaining half of the total bonus amount will be awarded 
to Mr Salamon in Deferred Shares and/or Options subject to
shareholder approval at the annual general meetings in 2003.
These Deferred Shares and/or Options will vest in August 2005
subject to Mr Salamon still being in employment with the Group
at the time of vesting. In addition to the Deferred Shares and/or
Options, the Group will also match this half of the total bonus
amount in the form of a Performance Share award. The vesting of
these Performance Shares will be subject to performance hurdles,
and will not be eligible for vesting until August 2006.
The Remuneration Committee has set a target cash bonus
amount of 70 per cent of salary for Mr Salamon for the year
ended 30 June 2004. The Group financial measures will represent
a 30 per cent weighting of his total performance measures. The
remaining 70 per cent relates to personal performance measures,
which include the performance of the Customer Sector Group for
which he has responsibility.
Assessed at the  target' level of performance, 40.2 per cent of 
Mr Salamon's remuneration is related to his performance and is
therefore  at risk'. 57 BHP BILLITON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2003        >

The increase in accrued pension is the difference between the accrued pension at the end of the previous year and the accrued pension at the end of the year
without any allowance for inflation. The increase in transfer value of total accrued pension is the difference between the transfer value at the end of the year
and the transfer value at the beginning of the year less the contributions made to the scheme by the Director also without any allowance for inflation.
The increase in accrued pension after making an allowance for inflation of 3.3 per cent (2002: 1 per cent) was US$63 966 (2002: US$1 35 921) and the transfer
value of that increase less the contributions made to the scheme by the Director was US$578 420 (2002: US$1 487 959).
(2)
The disclosure of the transfer value of total accrued pension at year end is the actual transfer value as at 30 June 2002, notwithstanding the fact that 
Mr Salamon was appointed as a Director on 24 February 2003.
BHP Billiton Plc and BHP Billiton Services Jersey Limited have
established non-contributory defined benefit pension
arrangements under which Mr Salamon will be entitled to a
pension at normal retirement date at age 60, equal to two-thirds
of pensionable salary provided he has completed 20 years service
with the Group. Only base salary is pensionable. At the date of
this Report, Mr Salamon was 48 years of age.
Each year, Mr Salamon has the right to determine whether his
pension provision for that year's salary under each service
contract with BHP Billiton Plc and BHP Billiton Services Jersey
Limited is made under a defined benefit or defined contribution
arrangement for service after 1 July 1 997. Alternatively, he can
choose to receive a cash sum at equivalent cost to the Group.
Once he has completed 20 years or more service, the cash sum
option will no longer be available to him.
If he has chosen in any year to have a defined contribution
arrangement he may elect subsequently to have the defined
contribution benefit for that year and any previous years
converted to a defined benefit promise, in which case he must
surrender the defined contribution benefit accrued.
If Mr Salamon retires before age 60, his accrued defined benefit
pension entitlement will normally be reduced for early payment
at the rate of four per cent per annum. 
In terms of the rules of the scheme all pensions in payment will
be indexed in line with the retail price index.
In the event of death in service, a lump sum benefit of four times
base salary will be paid. A spouse's pension on death in service 
of two-thirds of the prospective pension will also be paid. 
In the event of the death of Mr Salamon while in retirement,
a surviving spouse's pension of two-thirds of the pension in
payment, before the effect of commutation, will be paid. 
5. Former executive Directors
5. 1 Mr Paul Anderson
Mr Paul Anderson retired as Chief Executive Officer on 1 July 2002
but remained on the Board as a non-executive Director until 
4 November 2002. Details of remuneration paid to him during 
the year ended 30 June 2003 and the prior year are set out below.
All of the amounts paid by way of termination payments were
disclosed in the Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2002.
That disclosure is repeated below.
5. 1 . 1 T ermination payments
Under the terms of his service contract, Mr Anderson was entitled
to receive an amount of US$1 675 831, which is equal to twice his
annual base salary following his retirement on 1 July 2002. With
the Board's approval an equivalent amount has been paid to him
as follows:
  a consultancy arrangement with a total payment of 
US$1 04 739 under which Mr Anderson agreed to act as a
consultant to the Group for two years commencing 
5 November 2002.
  further payments totalling US$1 571 092.
In addition, Mr Anderson's contract entitled him to exercise 
those Performance Rights awarded under the original contract
that had not become exercisable, being 400 000 Performance
Rights (300 000 of which became exercisable on termination,
with a notional value of US$3 464 770 using a share price of
US$5.39 per share). Although his contract entitled him to exercise
400 000 rights without reference to service or performance
hurdles, Mr Anderson requested that the 1 00 000 Performance
Rights issued in relation to the year ended 30 June 2002 remain
subject to performance conditions. His performance against the
conditions was assessed in August 2002 and, as a result, all of
those Performance Rights became exercisable.
5. 1 .2 Remuneration
Other than the termination payment detailed in section 5. 1 . 1, 
Mr Anderson did not receive any remuneration, including any
Directors' fees, for the year ended 30 June 2003. In 2002 
Mr Anderson received US$2 61 5 01 9. 58 > BHP BILLITON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2003
Remuneration Report continued
5.2 Mr Brian Gilbertson
Mr Brian Gilbertson resigned as Chief Executive Officer and as a
member of the Board on 5 January 2003. Details of the payments
made to him on termination were announced on 23 May 2003
and are set out in section 5.2. 1 below. Details of the
remuneration paid to him during the year ended 30 June 2003
and the prior year are set out in section 5.2.2.
5.2. 1 T ermination payments
Under the terms of an agreement between the Group and 
Mr Gilbertson dated 23 May 2003, the following amounts were
paid to him:
   3 41 8 780 in respect of unpaid salary to 30 June 2005 in
accordance with the terms of his service contracts
   54 930 in respect of holidays accrued but not taken at the
time of his resignation 
   595 895 in respect of short-term incentive for the year ended
30 June 2003. This sum was reached by measuring the
performance of the Group at the date of resignation and 
pro-rating his entitlements to that date.
These amounts represented his entitlements under his contracts
of employment with the Group. The amounts are gross amounts
and subject to necessary withholdings.
In addition, Mr Gilbertson is entitled to be reimbursed an amount
capped at  1 50 000, for relocation and other costs associated
with his departure. The Group will also continue to provide
medical insurance cover for Mr Gilbertson and his wife until 
29 June 2005.
Those amounts are included in the table in section 5.2.2 below
and appear in US$.
No entitlements under any of the long-term incentive plans in
which Mr Gilbertson participated vested on his resignation. 
With the approval of the Board, the Committee exercised the
discretion granted to it under those incentive plans and agreed 
to allow Mr Gilbertson to continue to participate subject to the
following conditions: 
  that the number of entitlements that Mr Gilbertson retained be
reduced on a pro-rated basis to reflect his period of service 
  that shares would vest only if the pre-determined performance
conditions had been met 
  awards of shares, if any, would be made at the same time as to
other participants in the plans.
In exercising its discretion the Board and Committee took into
account the leadership role Mr Gilbertson had played both 
before and after the merger and felt that Mr Gilbertson should 
be entitled to participate, albeit at a reduced level to reflect his
period of service, if the pre-determined performance conditions
were ultimately met.
Awards in which Mr Gilbertson continues to hold an entitlement,
subject to these conditions, are set out in the table in section
5.2.3 below.
Mr Gilbertson is also entitled to benefits under pension plans in
which he had accrued an entitlement to 31 years of pensionable
service with all included employers at the date of his resignation
from BHP Billiton. Details of these entitlements are set out in
section 5.2.4.

The increase in accrued pension is the difference between the accrued pension at the end of the previous year and the accrued pension at the end of the year
without any allowance for inflation. The decrease in transfer value of total accrued pension is the difference between the transfer value at the end of the year
and the transfer value at the beginning of the year less the contributions made to the scheme by the Director also without any allowance for inflation.
The increase in accrued pension after making an allowance for inflation of 3.3 per cent (2002: 1 per cent) was US$57 531 (2002: US$50 363) and the transfer
value of that increase less the contributions made to the scheme by the Director was US$871 075 (2002: US$1 009 296).

Long-term share-based compensation
The amount in respect of long-term share-based compensation represents the estimated value of awards granted under the long-term incentive schemes. 
The estimated value has been calculated using a modified Black-Scholes option pricing methodology. The number of Performance Shares granted under the GIS
in November 2002 is as follows: 158 1 1 8 Performance Shares to Mr Aiken; 1 1 9 485 Performance Shares to Mr Kloppers; 1 41 897 Performance Shares to Mr Mills;
1 1 7 1 1 7 Performance Shares to Mr Lynch; and 1 47 263 Performance Shares to Mr Munro.
(5)
In accordance with UK GAAP , 1 00 per cent of the value of Deferred Shares earned during the 2003 year is included in remuneration in the column headed 
 Value of Deferred Shares'. Under Australian GAAP , such remuneration is to be included over the vesting period (in this case, the three years from 1 July 2002 
to 30 June 2005). The column headed  Adjustment' represents this difference. Hence, the addition of the columns headed  Value of Deferred Shares' and
 Adjustment' represents the remuneration associated with Deferred Shares under Australian GAAP .
7 . Non-executive Directors
7 . 1 Remuneration policy
In May 2001 shareholders approved an aggregate sum of 
A$3 million to be used to remunerate non-executive Directors.
Fees payable to non-executive Directors were set in 2002. There
was no change to either the fee structure, or rates payable during
the 2003 financial year .
The remuneration rates reflect the size and complexity of the
Group, the multi-jurisdictional environment arising from the Dual
Listed Companies structure, the multiple stock exchange listings
and the extent of the geographic regions in which the Group
operates. They also reflect the considerable travel burden
imposed on members of the Board. 
The elements of remuneration are:
  a base fee of US$60 000 per annum
  a fee of US$1 000 for each meeting attended
  a fee of US$7500 for the chairman of a Committee of the
Boards
  a travel allowance of US$1 000 for air travel that is more than
three hours but less than 1 2 hours and US$2500 where air
travel is more than 1 2 hours.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of
the Group's incentive arrangements. 61 BHP BILLITON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2003        >
The Chairman of BHP Billiton is Mr Don Argus. His remuneration
is fixed at four times the base fee for non-executive Directors. 
He does not receive any additional fees for chairing the
Nomination Committee, or any Board meeting attendance fees.
The Senior Independent Director of BHP Billiton Plc is Dr John
Buchanan. Dr Buchanan is paid a base fee of US$80 000, plus
additional fees and allowances as described.
Members of the Risk Management and Audit Committee 
(Mr David Crawford, Dr David Brink, Dr David Jenkins and 
Mr Cor Herkstr ter) also act as chairmen of the Customer Sector
Group Risk Management and Audit Committees and receive
attendance fees and travel allowances in respect of meetings 
of those Committees.
Fees are denominated in US dollars and are paid in either 
US dollars, Australian dollars or UK sterling, as nominated by 
the Director .
Each non-executive Director is appointed subject to periodic 
re-election by the shareholders (see page 38 of this Report for 
an explanation of the re-appointment process). There are no
provisions in any of the non-executive Directors' appointment
arrangements for compensation payable on early termination 
of their directorship.

7 .3 Non-executive Directors' retirement benefits
In 1 989 the shareholders of BHP Limited approved the introduction
of a Retirement Plan under which non-executive Directors accrued
entitlements to be paid by the Group on retirement from the Board.
The entitlements under this plan are net of any compulsory
payments by the Group to the BHP Billiton Superannuation Fund.
At the time of the merger, the Board resolved to close the Plan to
new entrants and to continue its operation only until such time as
the remaining participants continued in office.
In August 2003 the remaining participants in the Plan (Mr Don
Argus, Mr Michael Chaney, Mr David Crawford, Dr David Jenkins
and Dr John Schubert) all agreed to set aside their entitlements
and cease participation in the Plan effective from the first of the
2003 annual general meetings (to be held on 24 October 2003).
The Plan will be closed from that date and the entitlements that
have accumulated in respect of each of the participants will be
frozen and paid on retirement. Those amounts are set out in the
table below. An earnings rate equal to the five-year Australian
Government Bond Rate will be applied.
The following table sets out the accrued retirement benefits
under the Plan together with any entitlements obtained by the
compulsory Group contributions to the BHP Billiton
Superannuation Fund. 62 > BHP BILLITON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2003
