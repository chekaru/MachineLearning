BHP BILLITON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2004  
2. Remuneration Policy
The Committee recognises that the Group operates in a global
environment and that its performance depends on the quality 
of its people. T o prosper, the Group must be able to attract,
motivate and retain highly-skilled executives willing to work
around the world.
The key principles of the Group's remuneration policy are to:
  provide competitive rewards to attract and retain executive
talent on a global basis
  apply demanding key performance indicators to deliver results
across the Group and to a significant portion of the total
reward
  link rewards to executives to the creation of value for
shareholders
  assess and reward executives using financial and non-financial
measures of performance 
  ensure remuneration arrangements between executives are
equitable and facilitate the deployment of human resources
around the Group, and
  limit severance payments on termination to pre-established
contractual arrangements which do not commit the Group to
making unjustified payments in the event of non-performance.
3. Remuneration Structure
It is the Group's policy that service contracts for senior
executives, including the Chief Executive Officer, be unlimited in
term but capable of termination on 1 2 months' notice and that
the Group retains the right to terminate the contract immediately,
by making a payment equal to 1 2 months' pay in lieu of notice.
Some executives (but not the Chief Executive Officer) have
existing service contracts that contain notice periods that exceed
1 2 months. The Committee has determined that it will limit notice
periods to 1 2 months in all future contracts for executives, unless
exceptional circumstances exist.
The service contracts typically outline the components of
remuneration paid to executives but do not prescribe how
remuneration levels are to be modified from year to year .
Remuneration levels are reviewed each year to take account 
of cost-of-living changes, any change in the scope of the role
performed by the executive and any changes required to meet
the principles of the remuneration policy. 
Remuneration is divided into two components. The first is the
fixed component, which is generally made up of base salary and
benefits, including retirement benefits. The second is the at risk
component which is subject to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
and Performance Hurdles and is generally made up of short and
long-term incentives that take the form of cash payments and/or
participation in equity plans. The amount of at risk remuneration,
if any, that is earned by an executive is wholly dependent on that
executive's and the Group's performance against those pre-
determined KPIs and Performance Hurdles, details of which are
set out in sections 3.2. 1 and 3.2.2 of this Report. The percentage
of total remuneration that is attributable to the fixed and at risk
components for each of the executives for whom remuneration is
reported is set out on pages 50, 53 and 57 of this Report.
The cost and value of all of the components are considered as a
whole. BHP Billiton's remuneration policy is to pay at the median
level of remuneration for target performance and to provide the
opportunity for upper decile rewards for distinctive (upper decile)
performance. Details of each element of remuneration are set 
out below.
3. 1 Fixed remuneration
3. 1. 1 Base salary and benefits
Base salaries are quantified by reference to the scope and nature
of the individual's role and their performance and experience.
Market data is used to benchmark salary levels on a single global
scale, adjusted for local conditions. Particular consideration is
given to competitive global remuneration levels. 
In addition to base salary, selected executives receive benefits
that might include health insurance, relocation costs, life
assurance, car allowances and tax advisory services. All benefits
received by the executive Directors and Specified Executives, are
outlined in sections 4 and 5 of this Report.
3. 1.2 Retirement benefits
A range of retirement and death-in-service benefits operate
within the Group. These reflect the different statutory
entitlements in the jurisdictions in which BHP Billiton operates
and local market practice. 
Some retirement benefits are delivered under defined benefit
plans. The Committee considers that these types of plans can
place an unreasonable financial burden on the Group and has
therefore resolved that no new members will be admitted to 
the remaining defined benefit plans, save in exceptional
circumstances. 
Details of the retirement benefits of the executive Directors and
Specified Executives are set out in sections 4 and 5 of this Report. 
3.2 At risk remuneration
At risk remuneration is delivered as short and long-term
incentives under the Group Incentive Scheme (GIS) and applies 
to the Group's senior management, which includes the Company
Secretary. 
The GIS represents the variable component of remuneration and
rewards senior executives for meeting or exceeding KPIs that are
set each year and aligned to BHP Billiton's strategic framework. 
It is designed to drive sustainable, transparent performance in
the long-term and reflects the Group's commitment to crucial
operational targets. Participation in the GIS requires the approval
of the Committee. Employees are required to hold a minimum
number of BHP Billiton Shares throughout the period of their
participation, which varies according to their seniority. Some of the incentive plans replaced by the GIS in 2002 remain in
operation although no new awards have been made under them.
The last of the awards made under these plans will expire in 201 1 .
A summary of all incentive plans under which awards to
executive Directors are still to vest or be exercised is set out 
in section 3.2.3 below. Entitlements held by Specified Executives
under incentive plans are summarised in section 5.4 below and
detailed in note 31 to the financial statements.
3.2. 1 Group Incentive Scheme 
A summary of the current operation of the GIS is set out above. 
The Board has proposed a series of changes to the GIS, subject 
to the approval of shareholders. Further details of the proposed
changes are set out in the Notices convening the 2004 annual
general meetings or can be accessed on the website at
www.bhpbilliton.com/bbContentRepository/Events/PLCNOM04.pdf.
In summary, the changes are designed to provide additional focus
on the long-term performance of the Group. T o achieve this aim,
Directors will propose that the three-year Performance Shares
component of the GIS be replaced with awards under a new 
five-year plan. The manner of assessing the remaining components
of at risk remuneration under the GIS - cash bonus and Deferred
Shares - will remain intact.
The rules of the GIS are available on the BHP Billiton website 
at www.bhpbilliton.com/bbContentRepository/Events/
BHPBillitonLtdGIS.pdf and www.bhpbilliton.com/bbContent
Repository/Events/BHPBillitonPlcGIS.pdf.
During the year, Performance Shares were granted to GIS
participants in respect of their performance for the year 
1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003. These are subject to Performance
Hurdles, based on Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth and
comparative T otal Shareholder Return (TSR) during the
performance period (1 July 2003 to 30 June 2006), to be
measured in 2006. 
T o vest, Performance Hurdles for both BHP Billiton Plc and 
BHP Billiton Limited must be reached - 
  The EPS growth targets will be satisfied if the compound EPS
growth for the Group during the performance period is at least
equal to the greater of the increase in the Australian Consumer
Price Index or the increase in the UK Retail Price Index, plus 
2 per cent per annum, over the performance period.
  If the TSR calculations for BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton
Plc over the performance period result in one entity receiving a
higher TSR percentile than the other, both will be deemed to
have achieved the lower TSR percentile. The level of vesting is
as follows:

performance is measured comprises:
These Performance Hurdles were chosen to encourage
participants to focus on the long-term performance of the Group.
3.2.2 Performance of BHP Billiton
The KPIs for the year 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 were based on
Group, individual business and personal measures. There are
three levels of performance against each of the KPIs:
performance at threshold (the minimum necessary to qualify for
any reward); target (where the performance requirements have
been met); and stretch (where performance is exceeded).
The Group KPIs measured performance in delivering against
specific health, safety and environment targets and achieving
specified levels of performance against financial targets. 
The levels of performance achieved in relation to each of the
primary group measures were as follows: 
The performance of the Group relative to the markets in which it
operates, over the past five years, is illustrated by the two graphs
below. 
The first compares BHP Billiton's T otal Shareholder Return

Full details of all long-term incentive plans, including the number of participants is contained in note 23 to the financial statements.
Notes:
(1)
Although the awards under this plan have vested, the executive Directors have not yet exercised their awards and still retain an interest in the plan.
(2) 
The first performance period ended 30 September 2003. At that time, participants had the option to remain within the plan and enter a second performance period or leave 
the plan. The second performance period is a further two years ending on 30 September 2005. 
(3)
The TSR growth targets will be satisfied if the compound TSR growth for the Group during the performance period is at least equal to the greater of the increase in the
Australian Consumer Price Index or the increase in the UK Retail Price Index, plus 2 per cent per annum, over the performance period.
(4)
The EPS growth targets will be satisfied if the compound EPS growth for the Group during the performance period is at least equal to the greater of the increase in the
Australian Consumer Price Index and the increase in the UK Retail Price Index, plus 2 per cent per annum, over the performance period.
(5)
The percentage of performance rights that vest under the PSP 2001 will not be greater than the percentage of the Share award that vests under the RSS 2001 and vice versa.
(6) 
In respect of the second performance period > 4th position will mean a match of 1 25 per cent of Shares held by a participant. The percentage of performance rights that vest
under the MTI 2001 will not be greater than the percentage of the Share award that vests under the CIP 2001 and vice versa.
(7) 
Expiry date will be earlier if employment ceases.

49 BHP BILLITON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2004   REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
4. Executive Directors
At the date of this Report there were two executive Directors 
in office, Mr Charles Goodyear and Mr Miklos (Mike) Salamon.
The following sections detail their remuneration arrangements.
4. 1 Mr Charles Goodyear
4. 1. 1 Summary of remuneration arrangements 
Mr Goodyear's remuneration is made up of fixed and at risk
components. For the year ended 30 June 2004, fixed
remuneration, which comprises base salary, retirement benefits
and other benefits, equals 51 per cent of total remuneration,
when calculated at the target level of performance. 
The at risk remuneration is made up of short and long-term
incentives. Short-term incentives generally take the form of 
cash and are measured against KPIs. Long-term incentives are
delivered through equity awards and are measured against
Performance Hurdles. At risk remuneration for the year ended 
30 June 2004 equals 49 per cent of total remuneration when
calculated at the target level of performance. 
The Committee has assessed Mr Goodyear's performance for 
the year and has concluded that, save for the KPI relating to
Health, Safety and Environment, it was above target (see section
3.2.2 of this Report for the assessment in relation to the Group
KPIs). Accordingly, the value of the at risk remuneration, and
therefore the percentage of the total that is attributable to at risk
remuneration, will be greater than the percentage at target level. 
The tables that appear in sections 4. 1 .3 and 4. 1 .4 of the Report
have been prepared in accordance with the law and accounting
standards in Australia and the UK. While the information
presented is fulsome, it does not readily give a picture of the
amount of remuneration Mr Goodyear earned for the year . One of
the reasons for this is that the value of the at risk remuneration
cannot be finally determined until (i) approval to issue Shares has
been granted by shareholders; (ii) the price at which the Shares
are issued is known; and (iii) the performance period has expired
and performance has been assessed against the Performance
Hurdles. For these reasons the value of the at risk remuneration
has to be estimated.
In the case of Deferred Shares the only vesting condition is for 
Mr Goodyear to remain in the employment of the Group for two
further years. In the case of Performance Shares, the Performance
Hurdles include TSR and EPS measures. Accordingly, the number,
if any, of Shares that will ultimately vest cannot be determined
until the service period has been completed or the Performance
Hurdles have been assessed (in 2006 in the case of Deferred
Shares and 2007 in the case of Performance Shares). The value 
of the Shares that form part of the at risk remuneration appearing
throughout this section of the Report, are therefore estimates. 
The summary below outlines Mr Goodyear's fixed and at risk
remuneration for the year ended 30 June 2004.
At this year's annual general meetings shareholders will be 
asked to approve amendments to the GIS which will include the
replacement of the three-year Performance Share component of
the GIS with an award of Shares under a new five-year plan. If
this resolution is approved no Performance Shares will be issued
to Mr Goodyear in relation to the 2004 year . Shares under the
new five-year plan will be issued in their place. Details of the
proposed number of Shares and the Performance Hurdles that
will apply are detailed in the Notices convening the annual
general meetings. The method of assessing the remaining parts
of the at risk remuneration under the GIS - the cash bonus and
Deferred Shares/Options - will remain intact. The table above
includes a notional fair value for the Performance Shares that
would be issued (subject to shareholders' approval) under the
existing terms of the GIS.
4. 1.2 Service contract
Mr Goodyear has a single service contract with BHP Billiton
Limited and BHP Billiton Plc dated 21 August 2003. The contract
does not contain a fixed term and can be terminated by the
Group on 1 2 months' notice. Mr Goodyear is entitled to terminate
the contract on three months' notice. The Group may
immediately terminate the contract by paying Mr Goodyear 
1 2 months' base salary in lieu of notice. Where a payment is
made in lieu of notice, a contribution to a superannuation or
pension fund is also payable (see section 4. 1 .5 below).
Any entitlement Mr Goodyear might have in relation to short and
long-term incentives is covered by the GIS (details of which are
set out in section 3.2. 1). The rules of that scheme outline the
circumstances in which Mr Goodyear (and any other participant)
would be entitled to receive any Deferred Shares, Options or
Performance Shares that had been granted but which had not
vested at the date of termination. The rules of the GIS also
outline the circumstances in which Mr Goodyear would be
entitled to a cash bonus payment for the performance year in
which he leaves the Group. Those circumstances depend on the
reason for his departure. 
The Committee has discretion in relation to the entitlements 
of an employee on termination in some circumstances. This will
include situations where the employee does not resign or is

4. 1.2 Service contract continued
not terminated for cause, for example, where the Group and 
Mr Goodyear reach a mutual decision to part. In an effort to
provide the Group, its shareholders and Mr Goodyear with as
much certainty as possible in relation to his entitlements at
termination, the Committee has considered what Mr Goodyear's
entitlements might be if a mutual decision to part was reached.
The Committee has resolved that, providing Mr Goodyear has
served as Chief Executive Officer for no less than three years, 
he would be entitled to:
  any Deferred Shares or Options that had been granted but
were not exercisable at the date of departure. The Committee
believes that if the performance measures for the grant of
these Deferred Shares or Options have already been met, save
for the requirement that they be held for two years from the
date of grant, a mutual decision to part would override that
additional requirement to hold the Deferred Shares or Options
for the balance of the two-year period,
  a cash bonus for the year in which the parting takes place,
calculated according to Mr Goodyear's performance measured
against his KPIs for that year, and pro-rated back to reflect the
actual period of service in that year, and
  a right to retain entitlements to Performance Shares that have
been granted but that are not yet exercisable, pending
satisfaction of Performance Hurdles. The entitlements will be
pro-rated to reflect Mr Goodyear's period of service from the
date the awards were granted and will only become
exercisable if and when the Performance Hurdles are met. 
These entitlements would not arise if Mr Goodyear's contract 
was terminated for cause or if he resigned. Details of how 
the GIS would operate in those circumstances are set out in 
the rules, a copy of which is available on the website at
www.bhpbilliton.com/bbContentRepository/Events/
BHPBillitonLtdGIS.pdf.
Where the Committee retains discretion in relation to the award
of any long or short-term incentives, the rules of the GIS require
the Committee to exercise that discretion in good faith and
acting reasonably. 
Mr Goodyear would be entitled to any accrued entitlement that
he may have under the rules of the Retirement Savings Plan at
the date of termination as set out in section 4. 1 .5 below. 
4. 1.3 Remuneration
The remuneration paid to Mr Goodyear for the year ended 
30 June 2004 is set out in the table below.
Mr Goodyear participated in the GIS throughout the year . 
The target cash bonus amount, set by the Committee at the
beginning of the year, was 70 per cent of salary. Group KPIs
represented a 75 per cent weighting and personal KPIs 
25 per cent. The Committee has assessed the Group's and 
Mr Goodyear's performance for the year and awarded 
85.6 per cent of salary as a cash bonus. The Committee has set
Mr Goodyear's KPIs for the year ended 30 June 2005 and has
again set a target cash bonus amount of 70 per cent of salary.
Group KPIs for the year will represent an 80 per cent weighting.
Personal KPIs include additional value added growth projects,
project performance, demonstrable value from the market,
succession planning and corporate strategic issues.

Mr Goodyear is entitled to receive 48 per cent of his salary in the form of retirement benefits. For the period July to September 2003 he took this benefit as a cash
gratuity. From October 2003, he elected to defer receipt and participate in the Group's Retirement Savings Plan.

Deferred Shares
This represents the estimated fair value of Deferred Shares earned in the year . The actual Deferred Shares will be awarded to Mr Goodyear subject to approval

(4)
Share-based compensation - long-term
The amount in respect of long-term Share-based compensation represents the estimated value of awards granted under the long-term incentive schemes. 
The estimated value has been calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing methodology (taking no account of Performance Hurdles) adjusted to reflect the
expected vesting percentage. Details of outstanding awards and awards vesting in the year are set on in the tables below. The estimated value of the award
made in any year is allocated in equal amounts to each of the years during the performance period, but is adjusted each year to reflect the then expected vesting
percentage on a cumulative basis.
(5) 
In accordance with UK GAAP , 1 00 per cent of the estimated fair value of Deferred Shares earned during the 2004 year is included in the remuneration in the
column headed  Value of Deferred Shares'. Under Australian GAAP , such remuneration for the current and earlier years is to be included over the vesting period.
The column headed  Adjustment' represents the difference between the measurement methods. Hence the addition of the columns headed  Value of Deferred
Shares' and  Adjustment' represents the remuneration associated with Deferred Shares under Australian GAAP .

4. 1.5 Retirement benefits
Mr Goodyear's remuneration includes a payment in lieu of a
contribution by the Group to a superannuation or pension fund
fixed at an annual rate of 48 per cent of base salary. Mr Goodyear
may elect to have this paid into a superannuation or pension
fund or, instead, to defer receipt, subject to the rules of a
Retirement Savings Plan established for this purpose which allow
Mr Goodyear to accumulate these annual payments and to defer
receipt until after he retires from the Group. The Plan allows 
Mr Goodyear to establish retirement savings arrangements that
best meet his needs. 
In the event of death-in-service, a benefit of four times base
salary will be paid. The overall annual pension payable to his
spouse at the time of his death, until she dies, will be equal to
two-thirds of one-thirtieth of Mr Goodyear's pensionable salary
at date of death, for each year of service from 1 January 2003 
to his normal retirement date. Periods of service where Mr
Goodyear received his retirement benefit in the form of the cash
gratuity will be disregarded for the purpose of calculating any
pension amount. 53
REMUNERATION REPORT
BHP BILLITON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2004  
4.2 Mr Miklos (Mike) Salamon
4.2. 1 Summary of remuneration arrangements 
Mr Salamon's remuneration is made up of fixed and at risk
components. For the year ended 30 June 2004, fixed
remuneration, which comprises base salary, retirement benefits
and other benefits, equals 55 per cent of total remuneration,
when calculated at the target level of performance. 
The at risk remuneration is made up of short and long-term
incentives. Short-term incentives generally take the form of 
cash and are measured against KPIs. Long-term incentives are
delivered through equity awards and are measured against 
Performance Hurdles. At risk remuneration for the year ended 
30 June 2004 equals 45 per cent of total remuneration when
calculated at the target level of performance. 
The Committee has assessed Mr Salamon's performance for the
year and has concluded that, save for the KPI relating to Health,
Safety and Environment, it was above target (see section 3.2.2 
of this Report for the assessment in relation to the Group KPIs).
Accordingly, the value of the at risk remuneration, and therefore
the percentage of the total that is attributable to at risk
remuneration, will be greater than the target percentage. 
The tables that appear in sections 4.2.3 to 4.2.5 of the Report
have been prepared in accordance with the law and accounting
standards in Australia and the UK. While the information presented
is fulsome, it does not readily give a picture of the amount of
remuneration Mr Salamon earned for the year . One of the reasons
for this is that the value of the at risk remuneration cannot be finally
determined until (i) approval to issue Shares has been granted by
shareholders; (ii) the price at which the Shares are issued is known;
and (iii) the performance period has expired and performance has
been assessed against the Performance Hurdles. For these reasons
the value of the at risk remuneration has to be estimated.
In the case of Deferred Shares the only vesting condition is for 
Mr Salamon to remain in the employment of the Group for two
further years. In the case of Performance Shares, the Performance
Hurdles include TSR and EPS measures. Accordingly, the number,
if any, of Shares that will ultimately vest cannot be determined
until the service period has been completed and the Performance
Hurdles have been assessed (in 2006 in the case of Deferred
Shares and 2007 in the case of Performance Shares). The value of
the Shares that form part of the at risk remuneration appearing
throughout this section of the Report, are therefore estimates. 
The summary below outlines Mr Salamon's fixed and at risk
remuneration for the year ended 30 June 2004.
At this year's annual general meetings shareholders will be 
asked to approve amendments to the GIS which will include the
replacement of the three-year Performance Share component 
of the GIS with an award of Shares under a new five-year plan. 
If this resolution is approved no Performance Shares will be
issued to Mr Salamon in relation to the 2004 year . Shares under
the new five-year plan will be issued in their place. Details of the
proposed number of Shares and the Performance Hurdles that
will apply are detailed in the Notices convening the 2004 annual
general meetings. The method of assessing the remaining parts
of the at risk remuneration under the GIS - the cash bonus and
Deferred Shares/Options - will remain intact. The table above
includes a notional fair value for the Performance Shares that
would be issued (subject to shareholders' approval) but for the
proposed amendments to the GIS.
4.2.2 Service contract
Mr Salamon has contracts of employment with BHP Billiton Plc
and BHP Billiton Services Jersey Limited, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of BHP Billiton Plc, both dated 1 September 2003.
Mr Salamon's employment agreements automatically terminate
on his sixtieth birthday. At any time prior to his sixtieth birthday
each service contract can be terminated by either the Group or
Mr Salamon providing 1 2 months' notice. The Company may
make a payment in lieu of notice of 1 2 months, equal to 
1 50 per cent of base salary. This payment reflects the market
practice at the time the terms were agreed. 
The Committee has not considered the circumstances in which 
it would exercise its discretion to allow Mr Salamon to maintain
any ongoing participation in relation to the long-term incentive
schemes in which he participates in the event of his departure.
Those entitlements, if any, will be governed by the rules of the
schemes at the date of departure.
4.2.3 Remuneration
The remuneration paid to Mr Salamon for the year ended 
30 June 2004 is set out in the table below. 
Mr Salamon participated in the GIS throughout the year . The target
cash bonus amount, set by the Committee at the beginning of the
year , was 70 per cent of adjusted salary . Group KPIs represented 
30 per cent of the total performance measures. Fifty per cent of the
weighting applied to KPIs in relation to the operating business
and the remaining 20 per cent was attributable to personal KPIs. 
The Committee has assessed the Group' s and Mr Salamon' s
performance for the year and awarded 89.8 per cent of adjusted
salary as a cash bonus. The Committee has set Mr Salamon' s KPIs for
the year ended 30 June 2005 and has again set a target cash bonus
amount of 70 per cent of salary. Group KPIs for the year will
represent 30 per cent of the total performance measures. Forty per
cent of the weighting will apply to KPIs in relation to the operating
business. The remaining 30 per cent is attributable to personal KPIs
that include performance of key senior executives reporting to Mr
Salamon, safety-oriented operating discipline, performance of key
projects in the Non-Ferrous Materials group, development of the
BHP Billiton Way and the function of the Operating Committee.

Notes:

The increase in accrued pension is the difference between the accrued pension at the end of the previous year and the accrued pension at the end of the year
without any allowance for inflation. The increase in transfer value of total accrued pension is the difference between the transfer value at the end of the year 
and the transfer value at the beginning of the year less the contributions made to the scheme by the Director also without any allowance for inflation.
The increase in accrued pension after making an allowance for inflation of 3 per cent (2003: 3.3 per cent) was US$58 026 (2003: US$63 966) and the transfer
value of that increase less the contributions made to the scheme by the Director was US$594 275 (2003: US$578 420). 
BHP Billiton Plc and BHP Billiton Services Jersey Limited have
established non-contributory defined benefit pension
arrangements under which Mr Salamon will be entitled to a
pension at normal retirement date (age 60), equal to two-thirds
of pensionable salary provided he has completed 20 years service
with the Group or predecessor companies. Only base salary is
pensionable. At the date of this Report Mr Salamon was 49 years
of age.
Each year Mr Salamon has the right to determine whether his
pension provision for that year's salary under each service
contract with BHP Billiton Plc and BHP Billiton Services Jersey
Limited is made under a defined benefit or defined contribution
arrangement for service after 1 July 1 997. Alternatively, he can
choose to receive a cash sum at equivalent cost to the Group.
Once he has completed 20 years or more service, the cash sum
option will no longer be available to him.
If he has chosen in any year to have a defined contribution
arrangement he may elect subsequently to have the defined
contribution benefit for that year and any previous years
converted to a defined benefit promise, in which case he must
surrender the defined contribution benefit accrued.
If Mr Salamon retires before age 60, his accrued defined benefit
pension entitlement will normally be reduced for early payment
at the rate of 4 per cent per annum. 
In terms of the rules of the scheme all pensions in payment will
be indexed in line with the retail price index.
In the event of death-in-service, a lump sum benefit of four times
base salary will be paid. A spouse's pension on death-in-service
of two-thirds of the prospective pension will also be paid. 
In the event of the death of Mr Salamon while in retirement, 
a surviving spouse's pension of two-thirds of the pension in
payment, before the effect of commutation, will be paid. 
5. Specified Executives and Highest Paid Officers (other
than Directors)
The Specified Executives of the Group are those executives, other
than executive Directors and numbering at least five, who have
the greatest authority for managing the Group. This section
contains information relating to that group of executives.
As noted in section 3. 1 above, senior executives' total
remuneration is divided into two components - fixed and at risk.
The at risk component is derived only in circumstances where the
individual has met challenging KPIs and Performance Hurdles
which contribute to the Group's overall profitability and
performance. 
5. 1 Service contracts 
As outlined in section 3, it is the Group's policy that service
contracts for senior executives are unlimited in term but capable
of termination on 1 2 months' notice and that the Group retains
the right to terminate the contract immediately, by making 
a payment equal to 1 2 months' pays in lieu of notice. Where
contracts contain notice periods in excess of 1 2 months those
contracts reflect market practice at the time the terms were
agreed.
As reported in section 3, the service contracts typically outline
the components of remuneration paid to the executive but do not
prescribe how remuneration levels are to be modified from year
to year .
The termination provisions in the service contracts with the
Specified Executives are summarised in the table below. 56

Share-based compensation - long-term
The amount in respect of long-term Share-based compensation represents the estimated value of awards granted under the long-term incentive schemes. 
The estimated value has been calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing methodology (taking no account of Performance Hurdles) adjusted to reflect the
expected vesting percentage. Details of outstanding awards and awards vesting in the year are set on in the tables below. The estimated value of the award made
in any year is allocated in equal amounts to each of the years during the performance period but is adjusted each year to reflect the then expected vesting
percentage on a cumulative basis.
(5) 
In accordance with UK GAAP , 1 00 per cent of the estimated fair value of Deferred Shares earned during the 2004 year is included in the remuneration in the
column headed  Value of Deferred Shares'. Under Australian GAAP , such remuneration for the current and earlier years is to be included over the vesting period.
The column headed  Adjustment' represents the difference between the measurement methods. Hence the addition of the columns headed  Value of Deferred
Shares' and  Adjustment' represents the remuneration associated with Deferred Shares under Australian GAAP .

Resigned January 2004. As all awards under Share incentive plans lapsed on resignation, no amount of remuneration for such plans has been attributed to 
David Munro for the period.

5.5 Retirement benefits
For service following 1 January 2003, retirement, death and
disability benefits were aligned for the Specified Executives.
Retirement benefits were aligned on a defined contribution basis.
For each executive a defined contribution rate was calculated to
target a pension accrual of 2.2 per cent of base salary for each
year of service from 1 January 2003 to age 60. Allowance for a
two-thirds spouse's pension in retirement plus inflation
indexation in payment was also incorporated into the
calculations. T o deliver the retirement promise, the executive 
is given a choice of funding vehicles including the executive's
current retirement arrangement, an unfunded Retirement Savings
Plan, an International Retirement Plan or a cash gratuity in lieu.
The aggregate cost to the Company of exercising these funding
choices will not exceed the calculated contribution rate for each
executive.
On death-in-service a lump sum of four times base salary will 
be payable. In addition a spouse's pension of two-thirds of 
2.2 per cent of basic salary at death for each year of service from
1 January 2003 to age 60 will be payable. Dependants' benefits
are payable in addition and periods of service where the
executive elected a cash gratuity are excluded. If the executive
leaves on the grounds of incapacity, a disability pension payable
for the duration of the executive's life of 2.2 per cent for each
year of service from 1 January 2003 to age 60 will be payable.
Periods of service where the executive elects a cash gratuity are
excluded from the disability pension. No spouses' benefit will be
payable following death in disablement.
Benefits accrued by the executive in retirement arrangements
before 1 January 2003 will be payable in addition to those
described above.
6. Non-executive Directors
6. 1 Remuneration policy
In May 2001 shareholders approved an aggregate sum of 
A$3 million to be used to remunerate non-executive Directors.
Fees payable to non-executive Directors were last set in 2002 
and a review was considered appropriate in 2004. Following that
review the Board agreed to revise the existing remuneration
arrangements with effect from 1 July 2004. Fees payable to 
non-executive Directors will, in future, be reviewed on an 
annual basis.
The remuneration rates reflect the size and complexity of the
Group, the multi-jurisdictional environment arising from the 
Dual Listed Companies structure, the multiple stock exchange
listings, the extent of the geographic regions in which the Group

5.4 Share and Option plans 
The table below summarises details of the Specified Executives' interests in incentive plans including the number of Shares and Options
awarded in the financial year ended 30 June 2004, all of which were granted as remuneration. Detailed information on their interests in
the plans is set out in note 31 to the financial statements. No Options held by Specified Executives are vested but not exercisable, except
where stated. All of the Shares and Options issued form part of the executives' at risk remuneration. The extent to which Shares (save for
Deferred Shares and Options) vest, will be wholly dependent on the extent to which the Performance Hurdles are met. 59
REMUNERATION REPORT
BHP BILLITON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2004  
6. 1 Remuneration policy continued
operates and the enhanced responsibilities associated with
membership of Board Committees. They also reflect the
considerable travel burden imposed on members of the Board. 
In revising the fees the Board reviewed remuneration rates of
non-executive directors and chairmen of other companies,
including those companies in the comparator group used in the
GIS and detailed in section 3.2. 1 of this Report. The Board is
conscious that just as the Group must set remuneration levels to
attract and retain talented executives, so it must also ensure that
remuneration rates for non-executive Directors are set at a level
that will attract the calibre of director necessary to effectively
contribute to a high-performing Board.
The revised elements of remuneration are:
  a base fee of US$85 000 per annum (increased from US$60 000)
  a base fee of US$1 05 000 per annum for the Senior
Independent Director of BHP Billiton Plc (previously US$80 000)
  a base fee of US$450 000 per annum for the Chairman
(previously US$240 000)
  a Committee membership fee of US$1 5 000 for HSE and
Remuneration Committee members and US$20 000 for
members of the Risk Management and Audit Committee. 
No additional fee is paid for membership of the Nomination
Committee
  a fee of US$25 000 for the Chairman of each of the HSE and
Remuneration Committees and US$40 000 for the Chairman 
of the Risk Management and Audit Committee (previously
US$7500), and
  a travel allowance of US$2000 for air travel that is more than
three hours but less than 1 2 hours (previously US$1 000) and
US$5000 where air travel is more than 1 2 hours (previously
US$2500). 
The previous meeting attendance fee of US$1 000 for each
meeting attended has been abandoned.
Fees continue to be denominated in US dollars and paid in 
US dollars, Australian dollars or UK Sterling, as nominated by 
the Director .
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any 
of the Group's incentive arrangements.
A standard letter of engagement has been developed for 
non-executive Directors and is available on the website at
www.bhpbilliton.com/bbContentRepository/AboutUs/
Governance/lt_AppointmentasnonexecutiveDirector .pdf.
Dates of appointment appear on page 33 of the Corporate
Governance Statement.
Each non-executive Director is appointed subject to periodic 
re-election by the shareholders (see page 37 of the Corporate
Governance Statement for an explanation of the re-appointment
process). There are no provisions in any of the non-executive
Directors' appointment arrangements for compensation payable
on early termination of their directorship.
