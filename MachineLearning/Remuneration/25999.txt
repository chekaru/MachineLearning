> 1. Remuneration Committee
1. 1 Role
The Remuneration Committee, operating under delegated
authority from the Board, focuses on:
  remuneration policy
  adoption of incentive plans
  determination of levels of reward to the CEO and approval 
of rewards to those reporting to the CEO
  guidance on evaluating the performance of the CEO, and
  communication to shareholders on the Committee's work 
on behalf of the Board.
The Committee is committed to the principles of accountability,
transparency and to ensuring that remuneration arrangements
demonstrate a clear link between reward and performance. 
Its activities are governed by terms of reference, available 
on the BHP Billiton website at www.bhpbilliton.com/aboutus/
governance.
An independent assessment of the effectiveness of the
Committee has commenced and is due to be completed 
in the 2005 calendar year . The objectives of the review 
are to investigate and assess whether the Committee is:
  appropriately constituted and supported
  performing optimally
  operating as an integral contributor to the overall
performance of the Board
  capable of dealing with the complex issues surrounding
remuneration, and
  able to handle the level of complexity involved in setting
remuneration policy in a global environment.
A review of the Committee's terms of reference will also take
place as part of this process.
1.2 Membership and meetings
Independent non-executive Directors Dr John Buchanan
(Chairman), Dr David Jenkins, Lord Renwick of Clifton and 
Dr John Schubert were members of the Committee throughout
the year .
The Committee met seven times during the year and attendance
at those meetings is set out in the Corporate Governance
Statement on page 36.
The Group Chairman, the CEO and the Group Vice President
Human Resources attended Committee meetings by invitation
and assisted the Committee in its deliberations during the year,
except where matters associated with their own remuneration
were considered.
1.3 Advisors
The Committee appointed Kepler Associates, an independent
consultant, to advise on executive remuneration matters during
the year. The Board appointed Oppeus Pty Limited to conduct 
an independent review of all Committees, including the
Remuneration Committee. The Committee draws on data from a
range of external sources including publications by remuneration
consultants such as Hay Group, T owers Perrin and Hewitt Bacon
& Woodrow. A full list of these consultants, the type of data
sourced from them and whether they provide services elsewhere
in the Group is available on the BHP Billiton website at
www.bhpbilliton.com/aboutus/governance. 
2. Remuneration Policy
The Committee recognises that the Group operates in a global
environment and that its performance depends on the quality of
its people.
The key principles of the Group's remuneration policy are to:
  provide competitive rewards to attract, motivate and retain
highly skilled executives willing to work around the world
  apply demanding key performance indicators (KPIs) including
financial and non-financial measures of performance
  link rewards to the creation of value to shareholders
  ensure remuneration arrangements are equitable and facilitate
the deployment of human resources around the Group, and
  limit severance payments on termination to pre-established
contractual arrangements that do not commit the Group to
making unjustified payments in the event of non-performance.
3. Remuneration Structure
It is the Group's policy that service contracts for senior
management, including the CEO, have no fixed term but be
capable of termination on a maximum of 12 months' notice, 
and that the Group retains the right to terminate the contract
immediately, by making a payment equal to no more than 
12 months' pay in lieu of notice.
Some executives (but not the CEO) have pre-existing service
contracts that contain notice periods that exceed 12 months. 
The Committee has determined that it will limit notice periods 
to 12 months in all future contracts for executives.
Remuneration is divided into two components: fixed and at risk.
BHP Billiton's remuneration policy is to pay at the median level 
of remuneration for target performance and to provide the
opportunity for upper decile rewards for distinctive (upper
decile) performance. Remuneration levels are reviewed each year
to take account of cost of living changes, any change in the
scope of the role performed by the executive and any changes
required to meet the principles of the remuneration policy.
Details of the remuneration received by the executives for 
whom remuneration is reported are set out in sections 4 and 5 
of this Report.
3. 1 Fixed remuneration
Fixed remuneration is generally made up of base salary and
benefits. Base salaries are set by reference to the scope and
nature of the individual's role, and their performance and
experience. Market data is used to benchmark salary levels 
on a global scale, adjusted for local conditions. Consideration 
is given to competitive global remuneration levels. In addition,
some executives receive benefits that might include retirement
benefits, health insurance, relocation costs, life assurance, car
allowances and tax advisory services.
Some retirement benefits are delivered under defined benefit
plans. The Committee considers that these types of plans can
place an unreasonable financial burden on the Group and has
therefore resolved that no new members will be admitted to the
remaining defined benefit plans.

BHP BILLITON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005 3.2 At risk remuneration
At risk remuneration is delivered as short and long-term
incentives under the Group Incentive Scheme (GIS) and Long
Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) to senior executives. The amount of 
at risk remuneration, if any, that is earned by an executive is
wholly dependent on that executive' s and the Group' s performance
against pre-determined KPIs and Performance Hurdles.
The GIS rewards executives for meeting or exceeding KPIs 
that are set each year and aligned to BHP Billiton's strategic
framework. The LTIP is designed to drive sustainable
performance in the longer term. Both schemes reflect the
Group's commitment to meeting pre-determined targets and to
align incentives to shareholder value creation. Participation in
the GIS and LTIP is approved by the Committee. Executives are
required to hold a minimum number of BHP Billiton Shares
throughout the period of their participation in the plans.
A summary of all incentive plans under which awards to
executive Directors are still to vest or be exercised appears in
section 8. 1 below. Entitlements held by Specified Executives
under incentive plans are summarised in section 5.4 below 
and detailed in note 31 to the financial statements.
3.2. 1 Group Incentive Scheme and Long Term Incentive Plan
The rules of the GIS and LTIP are available on the BHP Billiton
website at www.bhpbilliton.com/aboutus/annualreports/
plc/downloads/GISrules.pdf, www.bhpbilliton.com/aboutus/
annualreports/plc/downloads/LTIPrules.pdf, www.bhpbilliton.com/
aboutus/annualreports/ltd/downloads/GISrules.pdf and
www.bhpbilliton.com/aboutus/annualreports/ltd/downloads/
LTIPrules.pdf.
At the beginning of the year, Performance Shares were granted
to participants under the LTIP . The Committee determines the
number of Shares granted to each participant but, in any 
one financial year, a participant cannot be granted Performance
Shares having an expected value that exceeds two times their
annual base salary. The value is determined using a Monte Carlo
or similar valuation model. The Performance Shares are subject
to a Performance Hurdle, based on T otal Shareholder Return
(TSR) during the performance period (1 July 2004 to 
30 June 2009), to be measured as at 30 June 2009.
The Performance Hurdle requires the Group's TSR to exceed a
median TSR benchmark over the performance period which will
be the weighted average TSR of a group of peer companies
(shown below), weighted 75 per cent to mining companies and
25 per cent to oil and gas companies.
The amount by which the Group's TSR exceeds the median 
will determine the number of Performance Shares that will 
vest. If the Group's TSR exceeds the median by a specified
percentage then 1 00 per cent of Performance Shares will vest.
The Committee will decide each year what that percentage 
will be for the year . For the 2005 financial year that percentage
was 5.5 per cent per annum. This is a cumulative amount and
equates to exceeding the median over the five-year performance
period by 30 per cent. This would be regarded by the Committee,
and the Board, as outperformance. 
The Performance Shares will be treated as though they would
have earned dividends from the date they were granted. Once the
underlying shares are issued or transferred to a participant, the
participant will receive a payment in lieu of those dividends. 
The entitlement of participants to Performance Shares is
summarised below:

will only exercise this discretion where it forms the view that the
Group TSR does not properly reflect the financial performance of
the Group over the Performance Period.
The peer group of companies against which the Group's TSR
performance is measured comprises:
  Alcan   Marathon Oil Company
  Alcoa   Newmont Mining
  Alumina   Noranda
  Anglo American   Norilsk
  BG Group   Phelps Dodge

  Companhia Vale do Rio Doce   Shell

  Freeport-McMoRan   Woodside Petroleum
  Impala   Xstrata

These Performance Hurdles were chosen to encourage
participants to focus on the long-term performance of the Group.
3.3 Performance of BHP Billiton
The KPIs for the year 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 were based 
on Group, individual business and personal measures. There 
are three levels of performance against each of the KPIs:
threshold (the minimum necessary to qualify for any reward);
target (where the performance requirements have been met);
and stretch (where performance is exceeded).
The Group KPIs measure performance in delivering against
specific health, safety and environment targets and achieving
specified levels of performance against financial targets.
The levels of performance achieved in relation to each of the
primary group measures were as follows:
The TSR performance of the Group relative to the markets in
which it operates, over the past five years, is illustrated by the
two graphs below. The first compares BHP Billiton's TSR
performance to the ASX 1 00 and the FTSE 1 00. The second
illustrates performance against the LTIP comparator group, set
out above. The earnings performance of the Group over the last
five years is illustrated by the graph of attributable profit on
page 1 of this Annual Report.

same period the return to BHP Billiton Plc shareholders was 
51 per cent.
The TSR performance for BHP Billiton Limited is inclusive of 
the Bonus Share awards and is adjusted for the demerger of
OneSteel Limited, and for both BHP Billiton Limited and

4. Executive Directors
During the year and at the date of this Report there were two
executive Directors in office, Mr Charles Goodyear and Mr Miklos
(Mike) Salamon. The following sections detail their remuneration
arrangements.
The tables that appear in sections 4. 1 .3, 4. 1 .4, 4.2.3 and 4.2.4
have been prepared in accordance with the law and Accounting
Standards in Australia and the UK. The tables contain the
amounts paid to the executive Directors during the year and a
value of the at risk component of their remuneration. The at risk
component is made up of Performance Shares, Deferred Shares
and/or Options and is an estimate only because the amount
cannot be finally determined until (i) shareholders have
approved the issue of the Shares or Options, and (ii) the
performance period has expired and the performance has been
assessed against the Performance Hurdles. Summaries of
remuneration for Messrs Goodyear and Salamon for the year
appear in sections 4. 1 . 1 and 4.2. 1 respectively.
4. 1 Mr Charles Goodyear
4. 1. 1 Summary of remuneration arrangements
Mr Goodyear's fixed remuneration is made up of base salary,
retirement benefits and other benefits, and equals 45 per cent 
of total remuneration when calculated at the target level of
performance. The at risk remuneration, made up of short and 
long-term incentives, equals 55 per cent of total remuneration
when calculated at the target level of performance.
The Committee has assessed Mr Goodyear's performance for 
the year and has concluded that it was above target (see section
3.3 of this Report for the assessment in relation to Group KPIs).
Accordingly, the value of at risk remuneration, and therefore 
the percentage of the total that is attributable to at risk
remuneration, will be greater than the target percentage.
Summary of fixed and at risk remuneration 
for the year ended 30 June 2005
4. 1.2 Service contract
Mr Goodyear has a single service contract with BHP Billiton
Limited and BHP Billiton Plc dated 21 August 2003. It does not
contain a fixed term and can be terminated by the Group on 
12 months' notice or by Mr Goodyear on three months' notice.
The Group has the right to immediately terminate the contract
by paying Mr Goodyear 12 months' base salary and the
superannuation (or pension) contribution, in lieu of notice.
The rules of the GIS and LTIP cover any entitlements 
Mr Goodyear might have in relation to short and long-term
incentives, including entitlements that have not vested at the
date of termination. The rules of those schemes outline the
circumstances in which Mr Goodyear (and any other participant)
would be entitled to receive any Deferred Shares, Options or
Performance Shares that had been granted but which had not
vested at the date of termination. The rules of the GIS also
outline the circumstances in which Mr Goodyear would be
entitled to a cash bonus payment for the performance year in
which he leaves the Group. Those circumstances depend on the
reason for his departure.
The Committee has discretion in relation to the entitlements of
an employee on termination in some circumstances. This will
include situations where the employee and the Group reach a
mutual decision to part. T o provide the Group, its shareholders
and Mr Goodyear with as much certainty as possible in relation
to the exercise of that discretion, the Committee has determined
what Mr Goodyear's entitlements might be if a mutual decision
to part was reached. The Committee has resolved that, providing
Mr Goodyear has served as CEO for a minimum of three years,
he would be entitled to:
  any Deferred Shares or Options that had been granted but
were not exercisable at the date of departure. The Committee
believes that as the performance measures for the grant of
these Deferred Shares or Options have already been met, save
for the requirement that they be held for two years from the
date of grant it is appropriate that they be awarded

calculated according to Mr Goodyear's performance measured
against his KPIs and pro-rated to reflect the actual period of
service, and
  a right to retain entitlements to Performance Shares that have
been granted but that are not yet exercisable, pending
satisfaction of Performance Hurdles. The number of
entitlements will be pro-rated to reflect Mr Goodyear's period
of service from the date the awards were granted and will
only become exercisable if and when the Performance Hurdles
are met.
These entitlements would not arise if Mr Goodyear's contract
was terminated for cause or if he resigned. Details of how the
GIS and LTIP would operate in those circumstances are set out 
in the rules, available on the website at www.bhpbilliton.com/
aboutus/annualreports/plc/downloads/GISrules.pdf,
www.bhpbilliton.com/aboutus/annualreports/plc/downloads/
LTIPrules.pdf, www.bhpbilliton.com/aboutus/annualreports/
ltd/downloads/GISrules.pdf and www.bhpbilliton.com/aboutus/
annualreports/ltd/downloads/LTIPrules.pdf.
Where the Committee retains discretion in relation to the award
of any long or short-term incentives, the rules of the GIS require
the Committee to exercise that discretion in good faith and
acting reasonably.
Mr Goodyear would be entitled to any accrued entitlement that
he may have under the rules of the Retirement Savings Plan at
the date of termination as set out in section 4. 1 .5 below.
4. 1.3 Remuneration
Mr Goodyear's target cash bonus amount, set by the Committee
at the beginning of the year, was 70 per cent of adjusted salary.
Group KPIs represented an 80 per cent weighting and personal
KPIs 20 per cent. The Committee has assessed the Group's 
and Mr Goodyear's performance for the year and awarded 
94.5 per cent of salary as a cash bonus. The Committee has set 
Mr Goodyear's KPIs for the year ended 30 June 2006 and has
again set a target cash bonus amount of 70 per cent of salary.
Group KPIs for the year will represent a 70 per cent weighting.
Personal KPIs include business growth, project performance,
business excellence, corporate strategic issues and senior
executive succession planning.

4. 1.5 Retirement benefits
Mr Goodyear's remuneration includes a payment in lieu of a
contribution by the Group to a superannuation or pension 
fund fixed at an annual rate of 48 per cent of base salary. 
Mr Goodyear may elect to have this paid into a superannuation
or pension fund or instead, to defer receipt, subject to the rules
of a Retirement Savings Plan established for this purpose. For
the year ending 30 June 2005, Mr Goodyear elected to defer
receipt into a Retirement Savings Plan which is an unfunded
defined contribution plan. The Plan allows him to accumulate
these annual payments and to defer receipt until after he retires
from the Group. The Plan allows Mr Goodyear to establish
retirement savings arrangements that best meet his needs.
If Mr Goodyear dies while still employed, a benefit of four times
base salary will be payable to his estate. A spouse's pension
equal to two-thirds of one-thirtieth of Mr Goodyear's
pensionable salary at date of death, for each year of service
from 1 January 2003 to his normal retirement date (age 60), will
be payable for the duration of his spouse's lifetime. Periods of
service where Mr Goodyear received his retirement benefit in 
the form of the cash gratuity will be disregarded for the purpose
of calculating any pension amount.
If Mr Goodyear leaves due to incapacity, the pension
arrangements are the same as for the Specified Executives 
(see section 5.5 below) save that his ill-health pension will be
one-thirtieth for each year of service from 1 January 2003 to 
his normal retirement date.
4.2 Mr Miklos (Mike) Salamon
4.2. 1 Summary of remuneration arrangements
Mr Salamon's fixed remuneration is made up of base salary,
retirement benefits and other benefits and equals 50 per cent 
of total remuneration when calculated at the target level of
performance. The at risk remuneration, made up of short and
long-term incentives, equals 50 per cent of total remuneration
when calculated at the target level of performance.
The Committee has assessed Mr Salamon's performance for the
year and has concluded that it was above target (see section 3.3
of this Report for the assessment in relation to the Group KPIs).
Accordingly, the value of at risk remuneration, and therefore 
the percentage of the total that is attributable to at risk
remuneration, will be greater than the target percentage.
Summary of fixed and at risk remuneration 
for the year ended 30 June 2005
4.2.2 Service contract
Mr Salamon has contracts of employment with BHP Billiton Plc
and BHP Billiton Services Jersey Limited, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of BHP Billiton Plc, both dated 1 September 2003.
Mr Salamon's employment agreements automatically terminate
on his 60th birthday. At any time prior to his 60th birthday each
service contract can be terminated by either the Group or Mr
Salamon providing 12 months' notice. The Company may make a

The Committee has not considered the circumstances in which it
would exercise its discretion to allow Mr Salamon to maintain
any ongoing participation in relation to the long-term incentive
schemes in which he participates in the event of his departure.
Those entitlements, if any, will be governed by the rules of the
schemes at the date of departure.
4.2.3 Remuneration
Mr Salamon's target cash bonus amount, set by the Committee
at the beginning of the year, was 70 per cent of adjusted salary.
Group KPIs represented 30 per cent of the total performance
measures. Forty per cent of the weighting applied to KPIs in
relation to the operating business and the remaining 30 per cent
was attributable to personal KPIs. The Committee has assessed
the Group's and Mr Salamon's performance for the year and
awarded 90.8 per cent of salary as a cash bonus. The Committee
has set Mr Salamon's KPIs for the year ended 30 June 2006 and
has again set a target cash bonus amount of 70 per cent of
salary. Group KPIs for the year will represent 35 per cent of the
total performance measures. Thirty-five per cent of the
weighting will apply to KPIs in relation to the operating business.
The remaining 30 per cent is attributable to personal KPIs that
include successful integration of WMC Resources Ltd, NPV added
value, alignment of business planning with business excellence
principles, operating committee performance, operating
discipline, performance of key projects and alignment of
operating businesses' strategy to corporate strategy.

Notes:

The increase in accrued pension is the difference between the accrued pension at the end of the previous year and the accrued pension at the end of the year
without any allowance for inflation. The increase in transfer value of total accrued pension is the difference between the transfer value at the end of the year
and the transfer value at the beginning of the year less the contributions made to the scheme by the Director also without any allowance for inflation.
The increase in accrued pension after making an allowance for inflation of 2.9 per cent (2004: 3 per cent) was US$42 275 (2004: US$58 026) and the transfer
value of that increase less the contributions made to the scheme by the Director was US$447 798 (2004: US$594 275).
Mr Salamon completed 20 years of service with the Group (and
its predecessor companies) on 1 April 2005 and consequently 
no further pension benefits will accrue other than to reflect
changes in his pensionable salary. He will be entitled to a
pension at normal retirement date (age 60), equal to two-thirds
of pensionable salary under non-contributory defined benefit
pension arrangements set up by BHP Billiton Plc and BHP Billiton
Services Jersey Limited. Only base salary is pensionable. At the
date of this Report Mr Salamon was 50 years of age.
For service after 1 July 1 997 and until 1 April 2005, Mr Salamon
has had the right to determine whether his pension provision for
that year's salary under each service contract with BHP Billiton
Plc and BHP Billiton Services Jersey Limited is made under a
defined benefit or defined contribution arrangement. He has
always chosen to take his benefits under a defined benefit
arrangement.
If Mr Salamon retires before age 60, his accrued defined benefit
pension entitlement will normally be reduced for early payment
at the rate of 4 per cent per annum. In terms of the rules of the
scheme all pensions in payment will be indexed in line with the
retail price index.
If Mr Salamon dies while he is still employed, a lump sum benefit
of four times base salary and a spouse's pension of two-thirds of
the prospective pension will be payable to his estate.
In the event of death while in retirement, a surviving spouse's
pension of two-thirds of the pension in payment, before the
effect of commutation, will be payable.
If Mr Salamon leaves due to incapacity, an ill-health pension of
two-thirds base salary will be payable. In the event of his death
during ill-health retirement, a spouse's pension of two-thirds of
the ill-health pension will be payable for the duration of his
spouse's lifetime.
5. Specified Executives and Highest Paid Officers 
(other than Directors)
The Specified Executives of the Group are those executives,
other than executive Directors and numbering at least five, who
have the greatest authority for managing the Group. They are
also the five highest paid executives in the Group. This section
contains information relating to the Group's Specified Executives
whose full names and titles appear in the Glossary of Terms at
the beginning of this Report.
5. 1 Service contracts
As outlined in section 3, it is the Group's policy that service
contracts for senior executives have no fixed term but be
capable of termination on 12 months' notice and that the Group
retains the right to terminate the contract immediately, by
making a payment equal to no more than 12 months' pay in lieu
of notice. Where contracts contain notice periods in excess of 
12 months, those contracts reflect market practice at the time
the terms were agreed. The service contracts typically outline the
components of remuneration paid to the executive but do not
prescribe how remuneration levels are to be modified from year
to year .

Notes

The Committee has not considered the circumstances in which it would exercise its discretion to allow the executives to maintain any ongoing participation in
relation to the long-term incentive schemes in which they participate in the event of their departures. Those entitlements, if any, will be governed by the rules
of the schemes at the date of departure. 5.2 Remuneration
As noted in section 3 above, senior executives' total remuneration is divided into two components - fixed and at risk. The at risk
component is derived only in circumstances where the individual has met challenging KPIs and Performance Hurdles which contribute to
the Group's overall profitability and performance.

5.5 Retirement benefits
For service following 1 January 2003, retirement, death and
disability benefits were aligned, where possible, for the 
Specified Executives as follows:
Retirement benefits: a defined contribution rate was calculated
to target a pension accrual of 2.2 per cent of base salary for
each year of service from 1 January 2003 to age 60. Allowance
for a two-thirds spouse's pension in retirement plus inflation
indexation in payment was also incorporated into the
calculations. T o deliver the retirement promise, the executive 
is given a choice of funding vehicles including the executive's
current retirement arrangement, an unfunded Retirement
Savings Plan, an International Retirement Plan or a cash gratuity
in lieu. The aggregate cost to the Group of exercising these
funding choices will not exceed the calculated contribution rate
for each executive.
Death-in-service and ill-health benefits: a lump sum of four
times base salary and a spouse's pension of two-thirds of 
2.2 per cent of basic salary at death for each year of service 
from 1 January 2003 to age 60 will be payable. In addition,
dependants benefits are payable. If the executive leaves due to
incapacity, an ill-health pension of 2.2 per cent for each year of
service from 1 January 2003 to age 60 will be payable for the
duration of the executive's life. In both cases, periods of service
where the executive elects a cash gratuity are excluded.
In the event of death during ill-health retirement, a spouse's
pension of two-thirds of the ill-health pension will be payable 
for the duration of the spouse's lifetime. Additionally, a children's 
pension equal to 20 per cent of the ill-health pension will be
payable for the first child or 33 per cent if there are two or 
more children, with the resultant pension amounts to be shared
equally between the children, until the first child ceases being in 
full-time education or the age of 23, whichever occurs first.
Benefits accrued by the executive in retirement arrangements
before 1 January 2003 will be payable in addition to those
described above.
These arrangements apply to each of the Specified Executives
except for Marius Kloppers who retained his previous pension
promise of one-thirtieth of base salary for each year of service. 6. Non-executive Directors
6. 1 Remuneration policy
The whole of the Board assumes responsibility for establishing
the remuneration policy for non-executive Directors. The
Remuneration Committee sets the remuneration for the
Chairman. The shareholders fix the aggregate sum that can be
applied to non-executive Director remuneration including the
remuneration of the Chairman. The aggregate sum available to
remunerate non-executive Directors is currently A$3 million.
The remuneration rates reflect the size and complexity of the
Group, the multi-jurisdictional environment arising from the 
Dual Listed Companies structure, the multiple stock exchange
listings, the extent of the geographic regions in which the 
Group operates and the enhanced responsibilities associated
with membership of Board Committees. They also reflect the
considerable travel burden imposed on members of the Board.
The Board is conscious that just as the Group must set
remuneration levels to attract and retain talented executives, 
so it must also ensure that remuneration rates for non-executive
Directors are set at a level that will attract the calibre of Director
necessary to effectively contribute to a high-performing Board.
Fees are denominated in US dollars and are reviewed annually.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of
the Group's incentive arrangements.
A standard letter of engagement has been developed for 
non-executive Directors and is available on the website at
www.bhpbilliton.com/aboutus/governance. Dates of appointment
appear on pages 31 to 33 of this Annual Report.
Each non-executive Director is appointed subject to periodic 
re-election by the shareholders (see page 36 of this Annual
Report for an explanation of the re-appointment process). 
There are no provisions in any of the non-executive Director's
appointment arrangements for compensation payable on early
termination of their directorship.
Remuneration for non-executive Directors is reviewed on an
annual basis. Following the review of remuneration for 2005 
the elements of remuneration, effective 1 September 2005, 
are as follows:

Appointed 3 February 2005. Mr Cordeiro vacated his office on 3 April and was re-appointed by the Board on 26 August. This unusual situation arose because 
Mr Cordeiro was not able to satisfy the minimum shareholding requirement of Directors as provided for in the Articles of Association of BHP Billiton Plc and 
the Constitution of BHP Billiton Limited because, like all other Directors and senior executives, he was in possession of unpublished, price sensitive information
relating to the acquisition by BHP Billiton of WMC Resources Ltd for the whole of the period that was available to him to comply. During the period for which 
Mr Cordeiro did not hold office as a Director he attended meetings by invitation. In addition to the fees disclosed in the table, Mr Cordeiro was paid US$27 542
during the period in which he was not a member of the Board.

The following table sets out the accrued retirement benefits
under the now closed Retirement Plan of BHP Billiton Limited,
together with any entitlements obtained by the compulsory
Group contributions to the BHP Billiton Superannuation Fund.
The Retirement Plan was closed on 24 October 2003 and
entitlements that had accumulated in respect of each of the
participants were frozen. These will be paid on retirement. An
earnings rate equal to the five-year Australian Government Bond
Rate is being applied to the frozen entitlements from that date.

8. 1 Summary of long-term incentive plans continued
Further details of all incentive plans, including the number of participants in those plans, are contained in note 23 to the financial
statements.
Notes:
(1)
Although the awards under this plan have vested, the executive Directors have not yet exercised their awards and still retain an interest in the plan.
(2)
The first performance period ended 30 September 2003. At that time, participants had the option to remain with the plan and enter a second performance
period or leave the plan. The second performance period is a further two years ending on 30 September 2005.
(3)
The TSR growth targets will be satisfied if the compound TSR growth for the Group during the performance period is at least equal to the greater of the
increase in the Australian Consumer Price Index or the increase in the UK Retail Price Index, plus 2 per cent per annum, over the performance period.
(4)
The EPS growth targets will be satisfied if the compound EPS growth for the Group during the performance period is at least equal to the greater of the increase
in the Australian Consumer Price Index and the increase in the UK Retail Price Index, plus 2 per cent per annum, over the performance period.
(5)
The percentage of performance rights that vest under the PSP 2001 will not be greater than the percentage of the Share award that vests under the RSS 2001
and vice versa.
(6)
The first performance period ended on 30 September 2003 when 60 per cent (out of a maximum of 80 per cent) Shares vested. At that time, participants had
the option to remain with the plan and enter a second performance period or leave the plan. In respect of the second performance period >4th position will
mean 125 per cent of those Shares vest. The percentage of performance rights that vest under the MTI 2001 will not be greater than the percentage of the
Share award that vests under the CIP 2001 and vice versa.
(7)
Expiry date will be earlier if employment ceases.

From publicly available data. Remuneration Report continued
58 BHP BILLITON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
>
Dividend Equivalent Payment
Awards of 2004 GIS Deferred Shares and Options (under the amended
scheme), 2005 GIS Deferred Shares, Options and 2004 LTIP Performance
Shares are entitled to a payment in lieu of dividends. This Dividend
Equivalent Payment is equal to the amount that would have been earned
over the performance or retention period and will be made on transfer of
shares to the participant. 
Other benefits
Includes medical insurance, professional fees, payout of unused leave
entitlements, life assurance-related benefits, car allowance and
relocation allowance and expenses where applicable.
Retirement benefits
Mr Goodyear is entitled to receive 48 per cent of his salary in the form of
retirement benefits. He has elected to defer receipt and participate in the
Group's Retirement Savings Plan.
The estimated benefit in respect of pensions includes contributions
payable in respect of defined benefit and defined contribution
arrangements and actual/notional contributions (for Mr Salamon and the
Specified Executives) that would have been required to secure the defined
benefit promises earned in the year . Details of the defined benefit pension
entitlements earned by Mr Salamon are set out on page 52. Mr Salamon's
benefits are fully accrued by 1 April 2005 and therefore the 2005 cost
reflects only nine months' accrual. A new funding valuation has been
carried out since the last Report and the 2005 monthly cost of accrual
reflects the increased contribution rate based on the revised assumptions
adopted.
Deferred Shares
This represents the estimated fair value of Deferred Shares earned in the
year . The fair value of Deferred Shares is estimated at grant date by
discounting the total value of the Shares that will be issued in the future
using the risk-free interest rate for the term of the vesting period. 
The actual Deferred Shares will be awarded to Messrs Goodyear and
Salamon subject to approval by shareholders at the annual general
meetings in 2005. Participants can elect to receive Options instead of
Deferred Shares or a combination of both. In the case of Deferred
Shares, the only vesting condition is for participants to remain in the
employment of the Group for two further years. Accordingly, the number
of Shares (if any) that will ultimately vest cannot be determined until the
service period has been completed. The value of the Shares forms part of
the at risk remuneration appearing throughout the Report, which are
therefore estimates.
Share-based compensation long term
The amount in respect of long-term Share-based compensation
represents the estimated value of awards granted under the GIS and LTIP .
The estimated value has been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation
methodology taking account of Performance Hurdles. Details of the
outstanding awards and awards vesting in the year are set out in the
tables on pages 49, 50, 51 and 54. The estimated value of the award
made in any year is allocated in equal amounts to each of the years
during the performance period.
Adjustment for Australian GAAP
In accordance with UK GAAP , 1 00 per cent of the estimated Dividend
Equivalent Payments receivable over the vesting period related to the
2004 and 2005 GIS Deferred Shares are included in the remuneration 
in the column headed  Dividend equivalent payment value'. Dividend
Equivalent Payments related to the 2004 LTIP performance shares will 
be recognised in remuneration when the cash payment is received.
Under Australian GAAP , total estimated Dividend Equivalent Payments
receivable are included over the vesting period. 
The column headed  Adjustment for Australian GAAP' represents the
difference between the measurement methods. Hence the addition of
the columns headed  Value of Deferred Shares',  Dividend equivalent
payment value' and  Adjustment for Australian GAAP' represents the
remuneration associated with Deferred Shares and Dividend Equivalent
payments under Australian GAAP .
2004 equity compensation
Amounts in respect of the estimated value of 2004 equity compensation
have been restated and have been calculated on a comparable basis to
the valuations performed at 30 June 2005. This restatement is largely
due to the application of AASB 1 046A which has resulted in the
estimated value of awards granted under long-term incentive schemes
now being calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation methodology
which takes account of Performance Hurdles.
