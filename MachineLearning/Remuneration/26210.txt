6 REMUNERATION REPORT
6.1 The Remuneration Committee
The Committee is committed to the principles of accountability 
and transparency, and to ensuring that remuneration 
arrangements demonstrate a clear link between reward 
and performance. Operating under delegated authority from 
the Board, its activities are governed by Terms of Reference 
(adopted by the Board in June 2006), which are available 
on our website. The Committee focuses on:
   Remuneration policy and its specific application 
to the CEO and other executives reporting to the CEO 
(Group Management Committee - GMC) as well as 
the general application to all our employees
   The determination of levels of reward to the CEO 
and other members of the GMC
   Providing guidance to the Chairman on evaluating 
the performance of the CEO
   Effective communication with shareholders on the 
remuneration policy and the Committee's work 
on behalf of the Board.
The members of the Committee during FY2008 were Dr John 
Buchanan (Chairman), Mr Carlos Cordeiro, Dr David Jenkins 
and the Hon E Gail de Planque. The Committee met five times 
in FY2008, and attendance at those meetings is set out in 
section 5 Corporate Governance Statement. At the invitation 
of the Committee, Mr Don Argus (the Group Chairman), 
Mr Marius Kloppers (the CEO as of 1 October 2007), 
Mr Charles Goodyear (the CEO pre October 2007) and 
Ms Karen Wood (Group Executive and Chief People Officer) 
attended meetings except where matters associated with 
their own remuneration were considered. Mr Derek Steptoe 
(Vice President Group Reward and Recognition) and Ms Jane 
McAloon (Group Company Secretary) also attended meetings 
by invitation. A report from the Committee and details of 
Board and Committee performance appear in section 5 
Corporate Governance Statement.
The Committee has access to advice and views from those 
invited to attend meetings, as mentioned above, and can 
draw on services from a range of external sources, including 
remuneration consultants. A list of all consultants, together 
with the type of services supplied and whether services are 
provided elsewhere in the Group, is available on our website. 
Kepler Associates LLP, independent advisers to the Committee, 
supplies specialist remuneration advice. They do not provide 
any other services to the Group.
6.2 Reporting requirements
The senior management team of the Group during FY2008 
was the Group Management Committee (GMC). The names 
and titles of the members of the GMC are set out in section 6.4 
of this Report.
Australian Accounting Standards and International Financial 
Reporting Standards require BHP Billiton to make certain 
disclosures for  Key Management Personnel' (KMP). KMP is 
defined as those persons having authority and responsibility 
for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the 
Group, directly or indirectly.
For the purposes of this Report, it has been determined that the 
KMP are the Directors and the members of the GMC who served 
during FY2008. In addition, the Australian Corporations Act 2001 
requires BHP Billiton to make certain disclosures in respect of 
the five highest-paid executives below Board level. In FY2008, the 
five highest-paid executives below Board level were all members 
of the GMC and are, therefore, already included as KMP .
6.3 Remuneration policy and structure
The Committee recognises that we operate in a global 
environment and that our performance depends on the quality 
of our people. It keeps the remuneration policy under regular 
review to ensure it is appropriate for the needs of the Group.
6.3.1 Key principles of our remuneration policy
The key principles of our remuneration policy are to:
   Provide competitive rewards to attract, motivate and retain 
highly-skilled executives willing to work around the world
   Apply demanding key performance indicators (KPIs), 
including financial and non-financial measures of performance
   Link a large component of pay to our performance and the 
creation of value for our shareholders
   Ensure remuneration arrangements are equitable and facilitate 
the deployment of human resources around our businesses
   Limit severance payments on termination to pre-established 
contractual arrangements that do not commit us to making 
unjustified payments.
The Committee is confident that these principles, which 
were applied in the year under review and are expected 
to be applied in FY2009 and beyond, continue to meet 
the Group's objectives.
Dear Shareholder
Welcome to the Remuneration Report for the 2008 financial 
year. As in previous years, our aim has been to produce 
a report that is clear and comprehensible while meeting 
the highest standards of disclosure. 
As foreshadowed in last year's Report, the Committee has 
undertaken a review of our executive incentive arrangements 
against our remuneration policy. As in prior years, the 
Committee had the benefit of independent advice from 
Kepler Associates. As a result of that review, the Board will 
propose some changes to the operation of the Group Incentive 
Scheme for members of the Group Management Committee. 
That proposal will be made to shareholders at the 2008 
Annual General Meetings and is explained in detail in the 
Notices convening those meetings. 
On behalf of the Committee, I thank you for your interest 
in our Report.
John Buchanan
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
9 September 2008

6 REMUNERATION REPORT continued
6.3.1 Key principles of our remuneration policy continued
The remuneration paid and payable to members of the GMC 
(including executive Directors) in respect of FY2008 is disclosed 
in this Report. It comprises fixed and at risk components. 
The manner in which these components are determined is 
outlined in this section. Tables showing the actual remuneration 
paid and payable, prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the UK Companies Act 1985 and the Australian Corporations 
Act 2001, and relevant accounting standards, are set out in 
section 6.5.5 for the GMC and section 6.6.2 for non-executive 
Directors. A summary of remuneration paid to Mr Kloppers, 
as CEO and executive Director, appears in section 6.5.1 of 
this Report.
6.3.2 Service contracts
It is our policy that service contracts have no fixed term, but are 
capable of termination on 12 months' notice and that we retain 
the right to terminate the contract immediately by making a 
payment equal to 12 months' base salary and retirement benefit 
contribution in lieu of notice. All members of the GMC have 
service contracts (see section 6.4.4 of this Report for full details). 
These contracts typically outline the components of remuneration 
paid, but do not prescribe how remuneration levels are to be 
modified from year-to-year.
6.3.3 Fixed remuneration
Fixed remuneration is made up of base salary, retirement 
and other benefits. It represents approximately 28 per cent 
of the individual's remuneration package (based on target 
performance and using Expected Values for share awards).
Base salary is targeted at industry average levels for 
comparable roles in global companies of similar complexity 
and size. Market data are used to benchmark salary levels 
and to inform decisions on base salary changes. Base salaries 
are set by reference to the scope and nature of the individual's 
performance and experience, and are reviewed each year. 
The review takes into account any change in the scope of 
the role performed by the individual, any changes required 
to meet the principles of the remuneration policy and our 
market competitiveness.
Retirement benefits for new entrants are delivered under 
defined contribution plans. All defined benefit plans are now 
closed to new entrants. Employees who participate in these 
legacy defined benefit plans can continue to accrue benefits 
in such plans for both past and future service unless they 
have opted to transfer to a defined contribution plan.
Other benefits include health insurance, relocation costs, 
life assurance and tax advisory services as applicable. 
All such benefits are non-pensionable.
6.3.4 At risk remuneration
At risk remuneration is geared to Group performance and is 
made up of short-term and long-term incentives. It represents 
approximately 72 per cent of the individual's remuneration 
package (based on target performance and using Expected 
Values for share awards).
Short-term incentives are delivered annually under the Group 
Incentive Scheme (GIS). Awards under the GIS are split equally 
between a cash award (being a percentage of base salary) and a 
grant of Deferred Shares and/or Options (to encourage employee 
retention and share ownership). These Deferred Shares and/or 
Options are subject to a two-year vesting period before they 
can be exercised. If, during that period, an individual resigns 
without the Committee's consent, or is dismissed for cause, 
their entitlement is forfeited. Members of the GMC have a 
target cash award of 70 per cent of base salary and a maximum 
award of 105 per cent.
The Board has proposed a series of changes to the Group 
Incentive Scheme, subject to the approval of shareholders 
at the 2008 Annual General Meetings. In summary, it is 
proposed that the target cash award for the CEO and members 
of the GMC be increased to 80 per cent of base salary and the 
maximum award be increased to 160 per cent of base salary. 
Further details of the proposed changes are set out in 
the Notices convening the 2008 Annual General Meetings.
The GIS incentivises the executives to achieve annual goals 
linked to the business strategy, budget and personal objectives. 
Measures are set to reflect the critical KPIs of the Group in 
a combination of financial and non-financial areas. The key 
Group measures for the GMC in FY2008 were Health and 
Safety, Shareholder Value Added and Net Present Value Added. 
In addition, each member of the GMC had personal KPIs based 
on their key area of responsibility. Eighty per cent of the GMC 
measures were Group-based and 20 per cent were personal.
The Committee believes that the KPIs set, and the relative 
weightings given to the different categories of KPI effectively 
incentivise short-term performance. At the end of each year, 
the performance level achieved against each KPI is measured 
and awards are calculated and paid according to the level 
of performance.
For FY2009, the GMC scorecard will continue to be based 
on health and safety, financial and personal performance.
Long-term incentives, in the form of Performance Shares, 
are awarded annually under the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). 
The diversified natural resources industry is capital intensive, 
cyclical and long term. Outstanding performance comes from 
accessing high-quality resources, successfully developing 
new projects and maintaining efficient and safe operations. 
The Committee believes that in this environment, success 
can best be measured by our Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
performance relative to the TSR of an index of a peer group 
of companies weighted 75 per cent to mining and 25 per cent 
to oil and gas (the Index).
The Performance Hurdle applicable to the awards granted in 
December 2007, and to those to be granted in December 2008, 
requires BHP Billiton's TSR over a five-year performance period 
to be greater than the weighted average TSR of the Index. 
To the extent that the Performance Hurdle is not achieved, 
awards are forfeited. There is no retesting.
For all Performance Shares to vest, BHP Billiton's TSR must 
exceed the weighted average TSR of the Index by a specified 
percentage, determined each year by the Committee. Since 
the establishment of the LTIP in 2004, this percentage has 
been set each year at 5.5 per cent. This annual amount equates 
to exceeding the weighted average TSR of the Index over 
the five-year performance period by more than 30 per cent. 
For performance between the weighted average TSR of the 
Index and 5.5 per cent per annum above the Index, vesting 
occurs on a sliding scale.
In the event that the Committee does not believe that 
BHP Billiton's achievement of the TSR hurdle properly reflects 
the financial performance of the Group, it retains the discretion 
to lapse the Performance Shares. It is anticipated that such 
discretion would only be used in exceptional circumstances.
The maximum award that may be made to a participant in 
any one financial year is limited by the rules of the LTIP to an 
award with an Expected Value of twice their annual base salary. 
Expected Value has been used because it enables the Committee 
to set total target remuneration levels for the CEO and his direct 
reports, taking into account the degree of difficulty of the LTIP 
Performance Hurdle and the consequent probability of awards 
vesting, together with ensuring that awards are externally 
competitive. The Expected Value can be defined as the average 
outcome weighted by probability, and takes into account 
the difficulty of achieving performance conditions and the 
correlation between these and share price appreciation. 
The valuation methodology also takes into account factors 
including volatility and forfeiture risk.
Participants in the GIS and the LTIP are eligible to receive 
a payment equal to the dividend amount that would have 
been earned on the underlying shares represented by the 
Deferred Shares, Options and Performance Shares awarded 
to those participants (the Dividend Equivalent Payment).

6.3.4 At risk remuneration continued
The Dividend Equivalent Payment is made to the participants 
once the underlying shares are issued or transferred to 
them. No Dividend Equivalent Payment is made in respect of 
Deferred Shares, Options and Performance Shares that lapse.
During FY2009, the Group will introduce a new incentive plan 
for employees below the GMC. The Plan will provide short-term 
and long-term incentives that attract, retain and motivate our 
senior managers. The Plan will be performance focused and 
make awards so as to maintain our market competitive position.
6.3.5 Share ownership guidelines
Participation in the GIS and the LTIP is approved by the 
Committee, and participants may be required to hold a 
minimum number of BHP Billiton shares (Minimum Shareholding 
Requirement - MSR), the level of which is determined by the 
Committee throughout their period of participation in the 
schemes. The current MSR for the CEO is 300 per cent of one 
year's base salary on an after-tax basis and for other members of 
the GMC is 200 per cent of one year's base salary on an after-tax 
basis, each calculated using the year-end BHP Billiton share price.
Members of the GMC are subject to a policy governing the use 
of hedge arrangements over BHP Billiton shares. This prohibits 
them from entering into hedge arrangements in relation to 
unvested shares and options and shares forming part of their 
MSR. Any permitted hedge arrangements require advance 
clearance under our Securities Dealing Code from specified 
officers and must be disclosed in this Report. None of these 
individuals currently has any hedge arrangement in place. 
In addition, the executives are prohibited from entering 
into any form of margin loan arrangements.
6.4 Group Management Committee 
remuneration details
This section contains information on the members of the GMC, 
including the executive Directors who served during FY2008.
The executive Directors who served during the year were 
Mr Marius Kloppers (CEO as of 1 October 2007 and previously 
Group President, Non-Ferrous Materials) and Mr Charles Goodyear 
(CEO pre October 2007). Mr Goodyear stood down as a Director  
and a member of the GMC on 30 September 2007 and retired 
from the Group on 1 January 2008.
In addition to the executive Directors, the other executives who 
served as members of the GMC during the year were Mr Alberto 
Calderon (Group Executive and Chief Commercial Officer), 
Mr Marcus Randolph (Group Executive and Chief Executive 
Ferrous and Coal), Mr Alex Vanselow (Group Executive and 
Chief Financial Officer), Ms Karen Wood (Group Executive and 
Chief People Officer) and Mr J Michael Yeager (Group Executive 
and Chief Executive Petroleum).
6.4.1 Summary of remuneration arrangements
Total remuneration for members of the GMC is divided into two 
components: fixed and at risk. The at risk component is derived 
only in circumstances where the individual has met challenging 
KPIs and Performance Hurdles that contribute to our overall 
profitability and performance.
6.4.2 Short-term incentives (at risk)
The 2008 short-term incentive outcomes were influenced 
by strong Shareholder Value Added achievement, moderate 
Net Present Value Added performance impacted by increasing 
cost pressures, and disappointing Health and Safety performance 
marked by an unacceptable number of fatalities. The poor Health 
and Safety performance for the year was taken into account in 
assessing incentive outcomes for the CEO and other members 
of the GMC. The personal performance of the CEO and other 
members of the GMC was strong. Details of the performance 
of each member of the GMC are set out in the table below:

Cash awards are paid in September following the release of our annual 
results. They are matched with a grant of Deferred Shares and/or Options 
made after the Annual General Meetings. Charles Goodyear's bonus was 
paid after he retired from the Group. He is not eligible to receive a grant 
of Deferred Shares.

Charles Goodyear's annual cash award has been pro-rated to reflect his 
period of service from 1 July 2007 to his retirement date, 1 January 2008. 
The percentage shown is based on an annualised salary.

Alberto Calderon joined the GMC in July 2007.
6.4.3 Long-term incentives (at risk)
All shares under award form part of an individual's at risk 
remuneration. The extent to which the Performance Shares 
will vest is dependent on the extent to which the Performance 
Hurdle is met and continued employment. A summary of interests 
in incentive schemes held by members of the GMC, including 
details of awards granted in FY2008, is shown in section 6.5.2 
of this Report.
6.4.4 Service contracts and termination provisions
The service contracts for the CEO and his direct reports 
have no fixed term. They typically outline the components 
of remuneration paid to the individual, but do not prescribe 
how remuneration levels are to be modified from year-to-year. 
The contracts are all capable of termination on 12 months' 
notice. In addition, we retain the right to terminate a contract 
immediately by making a payment equal to 12 months' base 
salary plus retirement benefits for that period.

6 REMUNERATION REPORT continued
6.4.4 Service contracts and termination provisions continued
Entitlements under the GIS, LTIP and Retirement Plans 
on ceasing employment
The rules of the GIS and LTIP cover any entitlements participants 
might have on termination in relation to short-term and long-term 
incentives. They outline the circumstances in which all participants 
would be entitled to receive any Deferred Shares, Options or 
Performance Shares that had been granted, but which had not 
vested at the date of termination. The rules of the GIS and LTIP 
provide that should a participant cease employment for any 
reason other than death/disability, resignation or termination 
for cause, the following would apply:
   Deferred Shares and Options already granted would vest in full
   Participants would have a right to retain entitlements to 
Performance Shares that have been granted but that are 
not yet exercisable. The number of such Performance Shares 
would be pro-rated to reflect the period of service from the 
commencement of the relevant performance period to the 
date of departure and would only vest and become exercisable 
to the extent that the Performance Hurdles are met.
The Committee regards it as an important principle that 
where a participant resigns without the Committee's consent, 
or their employment is terminated for cause, they forfeit the 
entitlement to their unvested Deferred Shares, Options and 
Performance Shares.
The rules of the GIS outline the circumstances in which participants 
would be entitled to a cash award for the performance year in 
which they cease employment. Such circumstances depend on the 
reason for leaving. The only circumstances in which the Committee 
has considered using its discretion to allow members of the 
GMC to receive a cash award in event of departure is for those 
individuals who have retired or are retiring.
On retirement, the CEO and his direct reports will receive any 
entitlements accrued under the rules of their respective retirement 
plans and as defined under their contractual arrangements.
6.4.5 Retirement benefits
With the exception of Alex Vanselow, who receives a 
defined benefit entitlement, all members of the GMC receive 
a defined contribution entitlement. To deliver the entitlement, 
the individual is given a choice of funding vehicles: a defined 
contribution plan, an unfunded Retirement Savings Plan, 
an International Retirement Plan or a cash payment in lieu.
Executive Directors
Prior to his appointment as CEO, Marius Kloppers had 
the choice of a (1)  defined benefit', (2)  defined contribution' 
underpinned by a defined benefit promise or (3)  cash in lieu' 
pension entitlement for each year since 1 July 2001. He elected 
to take cash in lieu for each year except for FY2004 when he 
elected to take a defined contribution entitlement with a defined 
benefit underpin. Mr Kloppers retains the option to convert the 
entitlement accrued in the defined contribution fund to a defined 
benefit entitlement. However, since the value of his defined 
contribution entitlement (US$531,431) exceeds the transfer 
value of the defined benefit underpin that he would be entitled 
to should he revert to the defined benefit promise (US$530,865) 
(both measured at 30 June 2008), the entitlement is being 
treated on a defined contribution basis. Upon his succession 
as CEO on 1 October 2007, Mr Kloppers relinquished all future 
defined benefit entitlements. His defined contribution entitlement 
is fixed at an annual rate of 40 per cent of base salary.
Prior to his retirement, on 1 January 2008, Charles Goodyear's 
remuneration included a payment in lieu of a contribution by the 
Group to a pension fund fixed at an annual rate of 48 per cent 
of base salary. Mr Goodyear elected to defer receipt of this 
amount into an unfunded Retirement Savings Plan established 
for this purpose. The Plan allowed him to accumulate the 
annual payments and to defer receipt until after he retired 
from the Group. On retirement, he was entitled to receive the 
accumulated value of funds under the Retirement Savings Plan.

6.5.2 Share awards
The following tables set out the interests held by members 
of the GMC in BHP Billiton's incentive schemes, and include 
ordinary shares under award and ordinary shares under option.
With the exception of Alberto Calderon, whose awards were 
over BHP Billiton Plc ordinary shares, members of the GMC were 
granted awards in FY2008 over BHP Billiton Limited ordinary 
shares. No member of the GMC was awarded Options under the 
GIS in FY2008. All vested GIS Deferred Shares, GIS Performance 
Shares, PSP Performance Rights, GIS Options and ESP Options 
are exercisable (subject to limitations imposed by the Group's 
Securities Dealing Code).
No further awards of GIS Performance Shares, ESP Options 
and PSP Performance Rights will be granted.
Awards of Performance Shares under the LTIP (including the 
number of shares awarded in FY2008)
In accordance with the rules of the LTIP, no Performance Shares 
vest, or can be exercised, prior to the end of the performance 
period unless a participant ceases employment due to death, 
serious injury, disability or illness, which renders the participant 
incapable of continuing employment. The first vesting date 
will be in August 2009.
The index of peer group companies for the LTIP since its 
implementation in 2004, comprises, or has comprised, the 
following companies: Alcan, Alcoa, Alumina, Anglo American, 
Apache, BG Group, BP, Cameco, Vale, ConocoPhillips, Devon 
Energy, Exxon Mobil, Falconbridge, Freeport McMoRan, Impala, 
Inco, Marathon Oil, Newmont Mining, Norilsk, Peabody Energy, 
Phelps Dodge, Rio Tinto, Shell, Southern Copper, Teck Cominco,

6.5.3 Shareplus
Shareplus, an all-employee share purchase plan, was launched 
in April 2007. Employees may contribute money to acquire 
shares (Acquired Shares) in any Plan year. The maximum annual 
contribution for Shareplus 2007 and Shareplus 2008 was and 
is US$5,000. On the third anniversary of a Plan year, subject 
to the employee still being in employment, the Company will 
match the number of Acquired Shares held by the employee 
at that time and award Matched Shares on a 1:1 basis. 
The employees have no beneficial entitlement to the Matched 
Shares until they are awarded. Acquired Shares are purchased 
on a quarterly basis. Employees can sell their Acquired Shares 
at any time. All executive Directors and members of the GMC 
are eligible to participate in Shareplus; non-executive Directors 
are not. The Acquired Shares that have been purchased on behalf 
of the executive Directors and members of the GMC are shown 
in their holdings of ordinary shares in section 7 Directors' Report.
6.5.4 Estimated value range of awards
The maximum possible value of awards yet to vest to be 
disclosed under the Australian Corporations Act 2001 is not 
determinable as it is dependent on, and therefore fluctuates 
with, the share prices of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc 
at a date that any award is exercised. An estimate of a maximum 
possible value of awards for members of the GMC can be made 
using the highest share price during FY2008, which was A$49.55 
and  21.96, multiplied by the number of awards for each scheme.

base salary. He elected to defer receipt and participate in 
the Group's Retirement Savings Plan. From 1 October 2007, 
Marius Kloppers was entitled to receive retirement benefits 
equal to 40 per cent of his base salary. He elected to defer 
receipt of the majority of the benefit and participate in 
the Group's Retirement Savings Plan.
(d)  Value of Deferred Shares: The amounts shown represent 
the estimated fair value of Deferred Shares earned in the year. 
The fair value of the Deferred Shares is estimated at grant 
date by discounting the total value of the shares that will be 
issued in the future using the risk-free interest rate for the 
term of the vesting period. Deferred Shares are equity-settled 
share-based payments. The actual Deferred Shares will 
be awarded to participants following the Annual General 
Meetings in 2008. Participants in the GIS can elect to receive 
Options instead of Deferred Shares or a combination of both. 
In December 2007, all KMP who were eligible to participate 
received Deferred Shares. Once awarded (subsequent to 
meeting KPIs and approval at the Annual General Meetings), 
the only vesting condition is for participants to remain in 
employment for two further years. Accordingly, the number 
of shares (if any) that will ultimately vest cannot be determined 
until the service period has been completed. The estimated 
fair value of the Deferred Shares forms part of the at risk 
remuneration appearing throughout this Report. The fair 
value of Deferred Shares is apportioned to annual remuneration 
based on the expected future service period, which is normally 
three years. The vesting of Deferred Shares may be accelerated 
in the event of leaving or retirement from the Group, in which 
case the expected future service period is amended.

6.5.5 Remuneration for GMC members continued
(e)  Long-term incentive awards: Long-term incentive awards 
are defined as equity-settled share-based payments in the 
form of shares. The amount in respect of long-term incentive 
awards represents the estimated fair value of Performance 
Shares granted under the LTIP . The estimated fair value 
has been independently determined using a Monte Carlo 
simulation methodology taking account of Performance 
Hurdles, the exercise price, the term of the award, the 
share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the 
underlying share, and the risk-free interest rate for the term 
of the award. Details of outstanding awards and awards 
vesting in the year are set out in the tables in section 6.5.2 of 
this Report. The estimated fair value of the award made in any 
year is allocated in equal amounts to each of the years during 
the vesting period. The fair value of Performance Shares is 
apportioned to annual remuneration based on the expected 
future service period, which is normally five years. Where 
entitlements to Performance Shares are preserved on leaving 
or retirement from the Group, the expected future service 
period is amended.
6.6 Non-executive Directors
The aggregate sum available to remunerate non-executive 
Directors is currently US$3 million. Shareholders will be 
asked at the 2008 Annual General Meetings to approve 
an increase in this sum to US$3.8 million, reflecting the 
recent appointment of additional non-executive Directors 
and increases in the level of fees since the aggregate sum 
was last fixed by shareholders.
The Board is conscious that just as it must set remuneration 
levels to attract and retain talented executives, so it must 
ensure that remuneration rates for non-executive Directors 
are set at a level that will attract the calibre of Director 
necessary to contribute effectively to a high-performing Board. 
Fees for the Chairman and the non-executive Directors were 
reviewed in July/August 2008, with the assistance of external 
advisers, in accordance with the policy of conducting annual 
reviews. The table below sets out the fees before and after 
the 2008 review.
The remuneration rates reflect the size and complexity of the 
Group, the multi-jurisdictional environment arising from the Dual 
Listed Companies structure, the multiple stock exchange listings, 
the extent of the geographic regions in which we operate and 
the enhanced responsibilities associated with membership of 
Board Committees. They also reflect the considerable travel 
burden imposed on members of the Board.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any 
of our incentive arrangements. A standard letter of appointment 
has been developed for non-executive Directors and is available 
on our website. Each non-executive Director is appointed subject 
to periodic re-election by shareholders (see section 5 Corporate 
Governance Statement for an explanation of the process). 
There are no provisions in any of the non-executive Directors' 
appointment arrangements for compensation payable on 
early termination of their directorship. Mr Alan Boeckmann 
and Mr Keith Rumble were appointed as non-executive Directors 
with effect from 1 September 2008. Dates of appointment of 
all Directors appear in section 4 Board of Directors and Group 
Management Committee.

6.6.1 Retirement benefits
The following table sets out the accrued retirement benefits under the now-closed Retirement Plan of BHP Billiton Limited. 
The Retirement Plan was closed on 24 October 2003 and entitlements that had accumulated in respect of each of the participants 
were frozen. These will be paid on retirement. An earnings rate equal to the five-year Australian Government Bond Rate is being 
applied to the frozen entitlements from that date.

Notes
(1) 
Since the closure of the Retirement Plan, no further entitlements have accrued. The increase reflects the accrual at the date of closure, together with the 
application of the earnings rate and foreign exchange rate (the translation from Australian dollars to US dollars).
(2) 
Lump sum entitlement disclosure in prior years included compulsory Group contributions to the BHP Billiton Superannuation Fund. Certain Directors 
have elected to transfer accumulated contributions to self-managed superannuation funds. Accordingly, the entitlement amounts disclosed relate 
to the benefits under the Retirement Plan.

6.8 Group performance
The performance of the Group relative to the markets in which it operates over the past five years is illustrated by the two charts 
below. The first compares our TSR performance with that of the ASX 100 and the FTSE 100, both of which are broadly-based indices. 
The second illustrates performance against the LTIP's peer group index (the relevant companies are listed in section 6.5.2 of this 
Report). The Committee believes that the broadly-based indices and the index of peer group companies are the most appropriate 
benchmarks for measuring our performance. For FY2008, the total return to BHP Billiton Limited shareholders (as measured by 
the change in share price plus dividends reinvested) was 60.72 per cent. Over the same period, the total return to BHP Billiton Plc 
shareholders (measured on the same basis) was 54.86 per cent. As illustrated by the charts below, BHP Billiton has strongly 
outperformed both the market and the pre-2007 LTIP peer group in the level of returns it has delivered to shareholders. Details of
the Group's performance, share price, dividends and other Group highlights over the past five years can be found on pages 2 
and 3 of the 2008 Business Review available on our website.
