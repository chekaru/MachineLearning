 RESPONSIBILITY (UNAUDITED INFORMATION)
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee has responsibility for approving all elements of the executive directors'
remuneration, including granting of discretionary share options. The Committee meets twice a year or, when required, to review
the remuneration of executive Board members and senior members of staff.
COMBINED CODE (UNAUDITED INFORMATION)
The Company complied throughout the period with Section 1(B) of the Principles of Good Governance on directors'
remuneration annexed to the Listing Rules. In framing its remuneration policy the Committee has also given full consideration
to all of the matters referred to in Section 1(B) of the Code of Best Practice.
PERFORMANCE GRAPH (UNAUDITED INFORMATION)
The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 requires the presentation of a graph of Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
compared to an appropriate comparator index over a five-year period. The graph below represents the TSR for Bidcorp plc against
the United Kingdom Transport Sector index over a seven-year period, which the directors consider to be the most appropriate index
for this purpose.
POLICY (UNAUDITED INFORMATION)
Directors' pay is set to be competitive with market rates and designed to be motivational, whilst remaining in the best interests
of shareholders. The committee consults with independent firms for advice on remuneration and benefit matters, where
necessary.  The elements of the remuneration package for executive directors are basic salary and benefits, pensions and
participation in the Company's share option scheme. The basic salaries of executive directors are reviewed annually with regard
to personal performance, company performance, changes in responsibilities and competitive market practices.
Messrs RW Graham (Group chief executive), IR Spry (managing director, Volume Distribution) and DA Winduss (managing
director, Property and Outsourced Services) are employed under six-month rolling service agreements.

* Benefits include settlements under a variation agreement dated November 21  2001 in which Messrs MJ Kingshott, PM Pascan and 
DA Winduss were entitled to receive payments of  120k,  30k and  10k respectively following their agreement to leave the Group Defined
Benefit Pension Scheme.
^ These non-executive directors waived their entitlement to directors' fees of  27k each during the period.
  This amount differs from the figure shown in note 3 on page 46 - highest paid director - by the aforementioned accrual for the pension
settlement.
Other benefits included above are Company car or allowance, fuel, medical benefits and accommodation.
Each executive director is entitled to participate in the Executive Incentive Bonus Scheme. A bonus of up to 25% of basic
annual salary would be payable on a result of between 85% and 115% of budget with one month's salary payable at 85%
increasing to three months at 115%. This bonus is payable based on two-thirds of the executive's divisional business profit and
one-third of the Group profit. 
The Board of directors sets the remuneration of the non-executive directors and the fees are set on a level which will attract
persons with the necessary experience and ability to make a significant contribution to the Company's activities. Non-executive
directors do not participate in the Company's share option scheme and are not eligible to join the Group pension scheme.  
ANNUAL REPORT 2003
REMUNERATION & NOMINATION COMMITTEE 35 On November 22  2001, Messrs MJ Kingshott, PM Pascan and DA Winduss entered into a variation agreement with Bidcorp
(formerly Jacobs Holdings plc) that, subject to the issue of the  Subscription Shares' as defined in the Circular and Listing
Particulars to shareholders approved on January 2  2002, any obligation that any member of the Bidcorp group had to make any
pension contribution in respect of Messrs MJ Kingshott, PM Pascan or DA Winduss would terminate and any right that 
Messrs MJ Kingshott, PM Pascan or DA Winduss had to participate in any pension scheme operated by the Group would cease,
save as in relation to the entitlement to require their employing Group company to contribute  2.00 for every  1.00 they
contributed to a money purchase pension arrangement designated by Messrs MJ Kingshott, PM Pascan or DA Winduss. This
contribution would be up to a maximum employer contribution of ten per cent of their pensionable salary per annum with effect
from November 1  2001.
The other remaining active members of the Jacobs Holdings Defined Benefit Scheme also entered into similar arrangements
with the Company at this date. This arrangement has resulted in both Defined Benefit Schemes that are operated by the Group
not having any active members and also being closed to new members with effect from November 1  2001.
