Directors' remuneration 
 
The board recognises that directors' remuneration is of legitimate concern to the shareholders and is committed 
to following current best practice. 
 
Policy on executive directors' remuneration 
 
The policy of the board is to provide executive remuneration packages designed to attract, motivate and retain 
directors of the calibre necessary to maintain the company's position and to reward them for enhancing 
shareholder value and return.  It aims to provide sufficient levels of remuneration to do this, but to avoid paying 
more than is necessary.  The remuneration should also reflect the directors' responsibilities and contain 
incentives to deliver the company's objectives.   
 
The Remuneration Committee comprises Mr B S North (Chairman) and Mr N B Fitzpatrick.  The terms of the 
Committee are to monitor remuneration levels and to make recommendations to the board regarding the 
remuneration of directors. 
 
There are two main elements of the directors' remuneration packages: 
i Consultancy fees 
ii Share option incentives 
Consultancy fees 
Consultancy fees are paid to related parties associated with each director.  The terms of such consultancy fees 
have been set and agreed in advance as set out in various consultancy agreements.
