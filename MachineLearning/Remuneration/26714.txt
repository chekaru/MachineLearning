Directors' remuneration report
This report provides the information required by the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. It also describes how the principles of
the Financial Services Authority's Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the  Combined Code') are applied by the Company in relation to
directors' remuneration and sets out the remuneration policy for the 52 weeks ended 30 March 2007 and, subject to ongoing review, the
current and forthcoming financial years.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee of the Board of directors was established following the demerger of the Company from Severn Trent. It consists
solely of the Company's independent non-executive directors (including, with effect from 1 December 2006, Bob Davies) under the
chairmanship of Angie Risley. Angie has substantial experience of human resources and has the appropriate skills to chair the Committee. She
does not chair any other committee of the Board. The Secretary of the Committee is Keith Woodward, the Company Secretary. Biographical
details of members of the Committee are set out on pages 34 to 35. 
The constitution and operation of the Committee comply with the Combined Code except that Bob Davies' appointment to the Committee was
made after the announcement of the relevant change to the Combined Code but prior to its coming into effect. In setting performance related
remuneration, the Committee has regard to the provisions set out in Schedule A to the Combined Code.
The terms of reference of the committee are available on the Company's website. Its principal roles are to make recommendations to the Board
on executive remuneration policy and to determine specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors and the fees of the
Chairman of the Company (although the Chairman is not involved in any discussion in relation to his own remuneration) on behalf of the
Board. The Committee also determines the remuneration of the members of the Executive Committee (the members of which are detailed on
page 42) and is responsible for the operation of the Company's share plans.
The Committee meets at least 4 times a year and generally consults the Chief Executive Officer concerning its proposals, although he is not in
attendance on matters relating to his own remuneration. It has access to, and from time to time takes, independent external professional
advice. The number of meetings during the year and attendance thereat are shown on page 41. During the year the Committee took advice
from New Bridge Street Consultants (NBSC), who were appointed following the demerger from Severn Trent and do not provide any other
service to the Company and Herbert Smith, solicitors. The terms of engagement between the Committee and NBSC are available from the
Company Secretary. The Committee also took advice from Malcolm Saville, the Personnel Director, and Keith Woodward, the Company
Secretary, neither of whom are involved in any discussions relating to their own remuneration.
No member of the Committee (other than the Chairman of the Company whose remuneration is determined by the Committee) has any
personal financial interest, other than as a shareholder, in the matters to be decided by the Committee.
All executive directors were in post at the time of demerger. In preparation for demerger and to reflect their responsibilities as executive
management of a listed public company rather than of a strategic business unit within Severn Trent, the Remuneration Committee of the Board
of Severn Trent Plc revised their salaries following a benchmarking exercise with the assistance of NBSC. 
The current levels of remuneration of the Chairman and the non-executive directors were also set in the light of that exercise. The executive
directors salaries were further reviewed in May 2007 with the new salaries taking effect on 1 July 2007.
Policy on Executive Directors' Remuneration
The Group's policy in respect of executive directors' remuneration and that of other senior employees is to ensure that it has an appropriate
mix of fixed and variable remuneration, including equity incentives, over the short and long term in order to attract, retain and motivate high
quality executive directors with an appropriate blend of skills and experience. By striking the correct balance between fixed and variable
remuneration, the Committee seeks to align pay with performance. In setting the level of remuneration for executive directors, the Committee,
among other factors, has regard to the levels of remuneration within the Group and within comparable companies. For remuneration
comparison purposes the Committee considers companies in the FTSE 250 Index as appropriate comparators. Overall remuneration
arrangements will be subject to regular review by the Committee to ensure that they remain competitive and have due regard to best practice.
The Group's focus is upon the following elements of the remuneration package:
  Basic Salary: generally not to pay higher than median by reference to other FTSE 250 companies but with the capacity for bonus (see
below) to reward upper quartile performance with upper quartile remuneration
  Annual Bonus: to provide additional short term remuneration to drive and reward Company and individual performance
  Equity Incentive: through regular grants under the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) to drive and reward outstanding business performance
over the longer term
  Pension Arrangements: to enable executives to make appropriate provision for retirement
A significant proportion of the executive's remuneration package is variable, being subject to the achievement of business and individual
objectives. The Committee considers this appropriate and it is its intention to continue with this policy and, in applying it, the Committee will
take account of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.  46 Biffa Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007
The chart above shows the ratio of salary, target bonus and the expected value of ongoing long term incentives for the executive directors. 
The Committee considers the mix and balance to be appropriate
The Company's policy on long term remuneration is to use the Long Term Incentive Plan described on page 47. The performance conditions, a
total shareholder return target with an earnings per share underpin, ensure that executive directors are only rewarded for superior corporate
performance. Satisfaction of the conditions is evaluated in conjunction with the Audit Committee and will also be subject to independent
external verification on behalf of the Committee.
The application of the policy on executive directors' remuneration in respect of each element of remuneration is set out below.
Basic salary 
The level of executive directors' salaries will be determined annually by the Committee by reference to market comparators (principally FTSE
250 companies), performance and internal relativities. Salaries were reviewed following the end of the year in May 2007 to take effect on 1 July
2007. The Chief Executive Officer's salary was increased to  452,400 (an increase of 4%) and the Finance Director's to  240,000 (an increase
of 11.6%). The first figure reflects general inflation. The second reflects the Finance Director's development into the role and that his salary was
initially set below the lower quartile given that this was his first role as a finance director of a listed company. The next salary review will take
place in June 2008. Details of salaries paid to executive directors are shown on page 50.
Annual bonus
The Group operates a discretionary annual cash bonus scheme representing a percentage of basic salary determined by the Committee based
upon performance. Prior to demerger, performance targets were set for the year by the Severn Trent Remuneration Committee relating
principally to the achievement of levels of Return on Capital Employed and Operating Profit and progress in areas of individual performance.
The scheme also included an over-riding safety multiplier relating to reduction of the Moving Annual Total of reportable incidents.
Following demerger, the target for Operating Profit was amended to take account of the removal of certain income caused by the restructuring
of the Severn Trent group and the burden of additional costs of Biffa as an independent company. In addition, to take account of the new
capital structure, the Return on Capital Employed element was replaced, while retaining the same target assumptions, as a measure by
Earnings Per Share.
As disclosed in both the Demerger Prospectus and the Severn Trent Directors' Remuneration Report 2006, reflecting the withdrawal of
participation in the Severn Trent Long Term Incentive Plan in the period prior to demerger, for 2006/07, the maximum bonus potential for the
executive directors was set at 150% of basic salary. Details of bonus paid are set out on page 50. In the case of both of Martin Bettington and
Tim Lowth 37% of the bonuses paid was attributable to the achievement of stretching strategic targets linked to their individual performance,
the balance being attributable to the achievement of financial targets.
For 2007/08, the Committee has determined that the performance targets will be related to EPS, Operating Profit, the achievement of individual
objectives and safety performance. The maximum bonus potential will be 100% of basic salary. For 2007/08 onwards, any bonus paid in excess
of 75% of salary will be paid in shares deferred for three years, subject to continued employment.
Equity incentives
All employee plans
Share Incentive Plan
The Biffa Share Incentive Plan (SIP) provides for the Company to make various types of award over shares on an all-employee basis. An award
of shares on demerger was seen as a useful means of ensuring that employees generally have a keen and immediate interest in the Company's
share price and are thereby aligned with shareholders and to serve as a retention tool.
The initial award was made to all employees then employed (including executive directors) on the basis of shares worth  50 per employee plus
 40 for each completed year of service up to a maximum of five and are held by the Trustee of the SIP on behalf of participants.
Consistent with the legislation governing this type of scheme, no performance criteria apply to any awards made under the SIP.
Awards will be forfeited in the event of cessation of employment within 3 years unless in exceptional circumstances including redundancy.
Awards may be left in the SIP until the participant ceases to be employed by the Company.

The Company has no current intention of making any further awards under the SIP.
Details of awards made to executive directors appear on page 52.
Sharesave
The Company operates a Sharesave Scheme which, from time to time, offers eligible employees an opportunity to enter into a simple and tax
efficient savings contract, operated through Lloyds TSB, and to buy shares at the end of the savings contract at a discounted price. Consistent
with the legislation governing this type of scheme, no performance criteria apply to any options granted under the Sharesave Scheme.
Subject to Board approval, it is intended that invitations to participate in the Sharesave Scheme will be issued to eligible employees on an
annual basis in January each year. The first invitation and subsequent grant under the Sharesave Scheme was made in January 2007, with a
three-year savings contract commencing on 1 May 2007.
All eligible employees (including executive directors) are entitled to participate in the Sharesave Scheme. Neither of the executive directors,
being Martin Bettington and Tim Lowth, currently hold options under the Sharesave Scheme.
Biffa Long Term Incentive Plan
The LTIP was introduced on Demerger. On an on-going basis, it is envisaged that awards will be made annually which will normally vest on the
third anniversary of award provided the participant remains in employment and pre-set performance conditions are first satisfied. Consistent
with the authorities granted in general meeting by the shareholders of Severn Trent when approving the demerger, an initial LTIP award of
200% of salary was made to the executive directors on 13 December 2006 with no award envisaged during 2007. Except in the case of new
joiners and promotions, the next allocation is, therefore, due to take place in June 2008.
Details of awards made to executive directors appear on page 51.
Going forward, the maximum award which may be made to any participant in any financial year will be limited to shares worth one and a half
times the participant's basic salary (or twice basic salary in exceptional circumstances). As stated above, the current intention is that the next
annual award will be made following the announcement of results for Biffa's first full year as an independent company in June 2008 and that,
subject to a review at the time by the Committee, awards are expected to be up to one times salary.
Awards are subject to a performance target which have initially been based on the Company's ranking in terms of total shareholder return
(TSR ) relative to other companies within the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts). The proportion of shares which will vest at the end of a
fixed three year performance period will be as follows:
In addition, awards will only vest to the extent the Committee certifies that Biffa's earnings per share has grown over the performance period at
a rate which is at least as great as the increase in RPI over the period.
The Committee will, during the course of the current year, review the appropriateness of the conditions and, should it decide to modify the
performance targets in subsequent years to any material extent, it will do so only after appropriate consultation with key institutional investors.
The number of shares comprising an award will increase to reflect the value of any dividends that would have been paid, over the period from
the date of award, on those shares which are comprised in the vested proportion of the award.
All awards made to date have operated within the dilution limits contained in the various plan rules.
Shareholding guidelines
The importance of aligning the interests of executive directors and investors is fully recognised by the Board and, accordingly, the Company has
now introduced a formal policy with regard to directors' shareholdings whereby executive directors are expected to retain at least half of the
number of shares acquired under long term incentive arrangements, including any deferred bonus shares, until a holding equivalent to at least
100% of annual salary is achieved.

Pension
Neither Martin Bettington nor Tim Lowth continues to accrue service in any Company-operated Pension Scheme. Rather, in the case of Martin
Bettington, he is entitled to receive a cash supplement equal to 30 per cent. of his salary in lieu of any pension benefits. Benefits payable to and
in respect of Martin Bettington under the Biffa Pension Scheme in respect of service prior to 6 April 2006 will be calculated by reference to his
pensionable salary immediately prior to the demerger adjusted by percentage increases equivalent to the percentage increases in his basic
salary after January 2007 limited to the average earnings index plus 5%, up to the date of leaving service with Biffa, or, if earlier, the date on
which he leaves the Biffa Pension Scheme (so long as the provision of such benefits does not prejudice his enhanced protection).
In the case of Tim Lowth, he is entitled to receive a cash supplement equal to 25% of his salary in lieu of future pension benefit accrual.
Benefits payable to and in respect of Tim Lowth in respect of service prior to 6 April 2006 will be calculated by reference to his pensionable
salary as at 9 October 2006 adjusted by percentage increases equivalent to the percentage increases in his basic salary after January 2007
limited to the average earnings index plus 5%, and benefits in respect of the period from 6 April 2006 to 9 October 2006 will be calculated 
by reference to the Biffa Pension Scheme earnings cap from time to time, in both cases up to the date of leaving service with Biffa.
Details of executive directors' pension benefits are set out on page 51:
Service agreements
The Company has service agreements with its executive directors, dated 12 September 2006, for Martin Bettington who was appointed to the
Board on 19 January 2001 and Tim Lowth who was appointed to the Board on 24 August 2001. The Group also has service agreements with
David Knott and Robert Tate, dated 14 April 2005, who retired as directors of Biffa Plc with effect from 30 August 2006 but remain employed
and are members of the Executive Committee. In accordance with the Combined Code and the Company's policy, the notice period is 12
months, whether from the Company or the executive, for each of the executive directors (12 months' notice from the Company or 6 months'
notice from the executive being required in the cases of David Knott and Robert Tate). In the event of early termination the Company may
choose to pay liquidated damages equivalent to annual salary multiplied by 1.75 either as a lump sum or, if so determined by the Committee,
in equal monthly instalments over the notice period.
Policy on executive directors holding outside positions
The Company will consider a request from an executive director to accept one appointment provided that it does not give rise to a conflict of
interest or excessive time commitment. Biffa Plc 49
Non-executive Directors 
The policy of the Company is to recruit non-executive directors of a high calibre with relevant business experience who are able to bring an
independent view to the Board's deliberations.
From the time of their appointment until the date of demerger, non-executive directors received a daily fee, thereafter an annual basic fee with
additional fees for chairing the Audit, Remuneration and Health and Safety and Environment Committees. Roger Payne receives additional fees
as Senior Independent Non-executive Director. The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the Board as a whole and no
director is involved in determining his/her own remuneration. Other than the reimbursement of expenses they do not receive any other benefits
from the Company.
Non-executive directors do not have formal service contracts with the Company but each has a letter of appointment copies of which are
available for inspection at the Company's registered office and, as set out in the Notice of Meeting, at the Annual General Meeting. Bob Davies
was appointed as a non-executive director pursuant to a letter dated 9 May 2006 for an initial period of 3 years and was appointed as non-
executive Chairman on 9 October 2006. Roger Payne was appointed a non-executive director pursuant to a letter dated 21 July 2006 for an
initial period of 3 years and was appointed Senior Independent Non-executive Director on demerger. Gareth Llewellyn and Angie Risley were
both appointed as non-executive directors pursuant to letters dated 21 July 2006 for an initial period of 3 years. The appointment of the
Chairman and non-executive directors may be terminated without notice from the Company without payment of compensation.
Details of fees paid to non-executive directors are shown on page 50.
