 This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee
(the Committee ) on behalf of the Board and in accordance with
the provisions of Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 and
Schedule B of the Combined Code issued in June 1998. The
Committee operates according to the principles outlined in the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and this report
describes how the Board has applied these Principles of Good
Governance relating to Directors' remuneration. 
A resolution approving the Committee's report will be proposed at
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The members of the Committee are Jeremy Curnock Cook
(Chairman), Sir Richard Needham and David Hankinson, all of
whom are independent non-executive Directors of the Company.
No Committee member has a personal financial interest (other
than as shareholders) in the matters to be decided.
Dr. Michael Driver, an Executive Committee member, is Secretary
to the Committee and attends the meetings. Crispin Simon, Chief
Executive, attends the meetings at the invitation of the Committee,
but is not present when his own remuneration is being discussed.
The Company and the Committee were advised by New Bridge
Street Consultants on remuneration levels amongst comparator
companies and on the policy for the award of share options. Aon
Consulting Limited has provided ongoing advice to the Committee
in relation to executive Directors' pensions and a bonus sacrifice
scheme for pension. Aon provided actuarial, pension and employee
benefit administration services to the Company. The Committee
consulted with Pitmans solicitors, with regard to the Company's
compensation policy. Pitmans also provide legal services to the
Company including advice on employment law.
POLICY ON DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
The Committee's policy on executive remuneration follows the
Company's policy on pay and benefits and is subject to continuing
review. This is to reward individual performance and enhance
shareholder value by creating a community of interest between
shareholders and employees; and the packages are designed to
attract, motivate and retain talented executives. There are four
main elements of the remuneration package for executive
Directors and senior managers: basic annual salary and associated
benefits, performance related annual bonus, the share option
programme and pension arrangements. This mix of performance
related and non-performance related remuneration is designed to
incentivise Directors and to reinforce good corporate governance.
SALARY AND BENEFITS
Basic salaries for executive Directors are reviewed annually. The
Committee sets salaries after consideration of the Company's
performance, market conditions, comparable salaries in peer
companies and the need to reward individual performance. The
executive Directors' base salaries were reviewed in December
2003 and were increased by an average of 3% from 1 January
2004. Executive Directors' service contracts, which include details
of remuneration, will be available for inspection at the Annual
General Meeting. In addition to basic salary, the executive
Directors receive the following benefits in kind: car allowance, life
assurance, private medical insurance and pension.
ANNUAL BONUS PAYMENTS
The Company's policy is that a substantial proportion of the
remuneration of the executive Directors and senior executives
should be performance related. As described below, executive
Directors may earn annual bonus payments (which are non-
pensionable) of up to 50% of their basic salary.
The Committee establishes the targets annually and for 2004 the
bonus payments are based on the achievement of predefined
goals and the individual weightings of those goals. 2004
performance targets were determined at the beginning of the
financial year based on the following criteria:
  Success in specified key research and development activities
  Sales and operating profit targets for two of the Company's
programmes
  Achieving the overall budgeted operating loss and cash 
balance for the year
  Regulatory approval of manufacturing at the Company's UK 
base
  Manufacturing and customer delivery targets for one of the 
Company's programmes
Each of these business  goals is allocated a specific bonus
percentage. Achievement of all of the goals will earn the Executive
Directors a 35% bonus while non-achievement of some of the
goals will reduce the bonus paid. There is an additional criteria
which will pay up to a bonus of 15% based on both of:
  The level of achievement of business goals
  The Company share price outperforming the FTSE techMARK
mediscience index over the year and closing the year at a 
price higher than it opens the year.
EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEMES 
There are two executive share option schemes currently in place and
the Company's policy is to grant options to all employees. Options
granted under these schemes are not offered at a discount. Grants
of options to executive Directors are at the discretion of the
Committee taking into account individual performance. The policy is
to phase the granting of share options rather than to award them in
a single large block to any individual and in normal circumstances
the options do not vest for three years. Options will be granted only
under the Employee Share Option Scheme 2003 and the
performance conditions remain as introduced in 2003, being that
the Total Shareholder Return should exceed that of the FTSE
techMARK mediscience index. The performance condition will be
tested after three years and if it is not satisfied at this stage, it may
be re-tested after four years from the same base date.

DIRECTORS' REPORT ON REMUNERATION 
Employee Share Option Scheme 2003:
At the year-end, 67 employees had options under this scheme which once exercised could give rise to the issue of 616,000 shares.
Executive Share Option Scheme 1995:
At the year-end, 415 employees and former employees had options under this scheme which once exercised could give rise to an issue of
3,345,354 shares.
PENSION ARRANGEMENTS
The executive Directors are all members of the Biocompatibles Retirement Plan, which is a money purchase scheme. The Plan also
provides for dependents' pensions and lump sums on death in service. Contributions by the Director and the Company are based on a
percentage of pensionable salary (not including bonus payments) and vary according to the age of the Director. No other payments to
Directors are pensionable. The normal retirement age under the Pension Plan for Directors is 60 years and employees is 65 years; early
retirement is permissible with Company consent from age 55. The Committee has introduced a scheme whereby employees and executive
Directors can elect to sacrifice all or a proportion of a potential annual bonus payment in return for Company contributions into the pension
scheme

*James Hambro resigned as Director on 22 May 2003.
It is the Company's policy that service contracts for executive Directors are for an indefinite period terminable by either party with twelve
months' notice, and that payments in lieu of notice should not exceed the Director's salary for the unexpired term of their notice period.
The Company has adopted a policy on mitigation to provide the opportunity to reduce the payment in lieu of notice. 
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of the non-executive Directors is determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association, based on
duties performed and independent surveys of fees paid by comparable companies. Non-executive Directors have letters of appointment.
The Company's policy is to appoint non-executive Directors for an initial three-year term subject to the requirements for re-election under
the Articles of Association. Non-executive Directors are not entitled to compensation for loss of office beyond the three month notice
period in their letter of appointment. The non-executive Directors do not participate in any bonus or share schemes of the Company and
are not eligible to join the Company's pension scheme.
SHARESAVE
The Company operates a savings-related share option scheme which is open to all Group employees. This is an all-employee scheme and
accordingly performance conditions do not apply. Savings contracts under the scheme run for three, five or seven years and options can
be granted at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares at the time of grant. Given current share option headroom
restrictions, it is not envisaged that the scheme will operate in 2004. At the year-end, 19 employees had options under this scheme which
once exercised could give rise to the issue of 57,975 shares. PERFORMANCE GRAPH
The following graph shows the Company's performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the performance of the
FTSE techMARK All-Share index. The Directors believe this to be the most appropriate index for comparison as it is the benchmark against
which performance is measured for the Company's 1995 share option scheme and is an index of which the Company has been a
constituent member throughout the period, and the FTSE techMARK mediscience index has not been in existence for the five year period.
The following information has been audited by the Company's auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as required by Schedule 7A of the
Companies Act 1985.

denotes the grant of super options
The market price of the Company's shares at the end of the financial year was 142.5p and the range of market prices during the year was
between 175p and 95.84p.
Employee Share Option Scheme 2003
For those share options granted after June 2003, the performance condition is that the Total Shareholder Return of the Company's shares
must outperform the FTSE techMARK mediscience index. 
Executive Share Option Scheme 1995
For those share options granted during and after August 1999, the performance condition is that the total shareholder return of the
Company's shares must outperform that of the FTSE techMARK All Share index.
For options granted prior to August 1999, the increase in Total Shareholder Return since the date of grant must be at least 10 per cent
greater than the increase in the Retail Prices index over a period of 3 years from the date of grant.
For super options granted during and after June 2000, participants will be able to exercise their options if the increase in the Total
Shareholder Return since the date of grant falls within the top quartile of Total Shareholder Return performance by the constituents of the
FTSE Mid-250 index of companies over the same period. Super options were created in 1998 to link higher potential reward for
exceptional performance for the most senior executives.
For super options granted before June 2000, participants will be able to exercise their options if over a period of any three months, such
period to begin no earlier than three months before the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, the average market value of an ordinary share
of the Company is at least 350p.
Super options can only be exercised after the fifth anniversary of the date of grant provided the performance criteria have been met.
