This report has been prepared by the Remuneration
Committee (the Committee ) on behalf of the Board and 
in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 7A of the
Companies Act 1985.  The Committee operates according to
the principles outlined in the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority and this report describes how the Board
has applied these Principles of Good Governance relating
to Directors' remuneration. 
A resolution to approve the Committee' s report will be
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting 
of the Company.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The members of the Committee are Jeremy Curnock Cook
(Chairman) and David Hankinson, both of whom are
independent non-executive Directors of the Company.
Sir Richard Needham retired from the Committee in
compliance with the independence criterion of the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance published in 
July 2003. No Committee member has a personal financial
interest (other than as a shareholder) in the matters to be
decided. In 2004 the Committee met on six occasions.
Attendance at meetings is set out on page 20 and the 
Terms of Reference for the Committee are available on 
the Company' s website: www.biocompatibles.com.
Dr. Michael Driver, an Executive Committee member, 
is Secretary to the Committee and attends the meetings.
Crispin Simon, Chief Executive, attends the meetings at 
the invitation of the Committee, but is not present when 
his own remuneration is being discussed.  Geoff Tompsett,
Director of Human Resources and an Executive Committee
member, also attends meetings upon the invitation of the
Chairman to facilitate discussions on remuneration and
incentive schemes. The Committee, in setting executive
directors' remuneration, referred to a survey undertaken 
by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP on remuneration
levels amongst comparator companies. New Bridge Street
Consultants LLP also provided advice on the policy for 
the award of share options and the proposed introduction 
of new Share Incentive Plans.  Aon Consulting Limited
provided advice to the Committee in relation to executive
Directors' pensions and a bonus sacrifice scheme for
pensions. Aon provided actuarial, pension and employee
benefit administration services to the Company. Pitmans
provide legal services to the Company including advice 
on employment law.
POLICY ON DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
The Committee' s policy on executive directors'
remuneration mirrors the Company' s policies on pay and
benefits and is subject to regular review.  This is to reward
on the basis of median salaries within the healthcare/biotech
sector with the potential to reward up to the upper quartile
of the sector through bonuses and share incentive schemes.
The packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain
talented executives.   The four main elements of the
remuneration package for executive Directors and senior
managers are basic annual salary and associated benefits,
performance related annual bonus, the long term incentive
programme and pension arrangements.  This mix of
performance related and non-performance related
remuneration is designed to incentivise Directors and 
senior executives.
Salary and Benefits
The Committee sets salaries after consideration of the
Company' s performance, market conditions, comparable
salaries in peer companies and the need to reward individual
performance. The Committee reviews executive Directors'
basic salaries annually in December with changes becoming
applicable from the start of the following year. In addition,
salaries are reviewed at the time of the appointment of 
new directors to the Board. The average increase effective
from 1 January 2005 was 7%, which was driven by above
inflation increases for Dr. Peter Stratford and, particularly,
Ian Ardill. These increases were required to reflect 
median levels for the roles in comparable companies.
Details of each executive Directors' remuneration are 
set out on page 29.  
Executive Directors' service contracts, which include 
details of remuneration, will be available for inspection 
at the Annual General Meeting. In addition to basic salary,
the executive Directors receive the following benefits 
in kind: car allowance, life assurance, private medical
insurance and pension.
Annual Bonus Payments
The Company' s policy is that a substantial proportion 
of the remuneration of the executive Directors and senior
executives should be performance related. As described
below, executive Directors may earn annual bonus 
payments (which are non-pensionable) of up to 50% of 
their basic salary.  
Directors' Report on Remuneration 27 Annual Report 2004
The Committee establishes the targets annually.  The
achievement of the 2004 annual goals is described in 
the Operational Review on page 8. For 2005 the bonus
payments are based on the achievement of predefined 
goals and the individual weightings of those goals. 2005
performance targets were determined at the beginning of 
the financial year based on the following criteria:
- Achievement of budgeted sales revenue targets.
- Achievement of budgeted cash balance for the year end.
- Achievement of regulatory filing goals.
- Commencement of a new clinical programme and a 
new indication.
- Commencement of and first patient recruitment in 
a randomised controlled trial for the Doxorubicin 
Eluting Bead
Each of these business  goals is allocated a specific bonus
percentage.  Achievement of all of the goals will earn the
executive Directors a 35% bonus while non-achievement 
of the goals will reduce the bonus paid. There are additional
criteria which will pay a bonus of up to 15% based on 
pre-determined personal goals for the executive Directors,
proportionate to the achievement of the Company' s 
Bonus Goals. 
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLANS
New Performance Share Plan
The Remuneration Committee is mindful of the need to
reward performance and align the interests of management
and shareholders whilst being constrained by the dilution
effect of the returns of capital and subsequent share
consolidations. Given the imminent expiry of the 2003
Employee Share Option Scheme, the Committee has
considered the adoption of new share based incentive
schemes in the form of a Performance Share Plan in which
the most senior executives may participate and a Share
Incentive Plan in which all employees may participate. The
proposals will be put to shareholders at the Annual General
Meeting and are set out in full in the Notice thereof. The
Committee considers that the proposals reflect current best
practice and enable the Committee to reward performance
without at the same time exacerbating the dilution issue
which has been adversely affected by the reduction in the
number of shares in issue following the returns of capital in
2002, 2003 and a further return of approximately 29p per
share expected in 2005. The Remuneration Committee is
mindful of dilution to shareholders through issuing new
shares to employees under various employee share schemes.
The move away from a policy based on share options to one
based on awarding shares will result in a significantly lower
level of share usage and the Remuneration Committee
anticipates that, over time, the Company will be able to
operate within a dilution framework of 10% of issued share
capital over any ten-year period. The issue of dilution is
explored more fully in the Shareholder Circular
accompanying the Notice of Meeting for this year' s AGM. 
It is proposed that the shares awarded under the
Performance Share Plan will be limited to one times salary
except in exceptional circumstances such as recruitment 
to senior positions where the maximum value of shares
awarded will be limited to two times salary.  The awards
will vest after three years, subject to a performance
condition based on the Company' s Total Shareholder Return
(TSR ) against a comparator group comprising the
constituents of the FTSE techMARK All-Share Index of
which the Company is a member.  Where the TSR ranks
between median and upper quartile after three years the
Performance Award will vest pro-rata between 25% and
100%. Where the TSR ranks below median after three years
the performance target will not have been met and the
Performance Award will lapse. The relevant TSR figures
will be averaged over the three-month periods preceding the
beginning and end of the performance period. There is no
opportunity for retesting the performance condition.
Measuring the Company' s TSR performance against this
benchmark will reward stock market outperformance and
will preserve good alignment between the interests 
of executives and shareholders. The TSR performance
condition will be calculated by independent advisers and
verified by the Remuneration Committee.
Upon the launch of this scheme, no further share options
will be awarded under the existing schemes.
Shareholding
In order to ensure that executive Directors' interests are
aligned with those of shareholders, it is proposed to adopt
shareholding guidelines linked to the out-turn from the
proposed share based incentive schemes whereby executive
directors will be expected to retain no fewer that 50% of
shares net of taxes until a shareholding equivalent to 100%
of base salary has been achieved.  Executive Committee
members will also be expected to build and maintain a
shareholding within the Company based on a percentage of
salary yet to be set by the Remuneration Committee.

PENSION ARRANGEMENTS
Each of the executive Directors is a member of the Biocompatibles Retirement Plan, which is a money purchase scheme. 
The Plan also provides for dependants' pensions and a lump sum on death-in-service.  Contributions by the Director and 
the Company are based on a percentage of pensionable salary (not including bonus payments) and vary according to the 
age of the Director.  No other payments to Directors are pensionable.  The normal retirement age under the Pension Plan 
for Directors is 60 years and for other employees is 65 years; early retirement is permissible with Company consent from 
age 55. The Committee has introduced a scheme whereby employees and executive Directors can elect to sacrifice all 
or a proportion of a potential annual bonus payment in return for Company contributions into the pension scheme. 
An additional voluntary contribution (A VC ) matching arrangement was introduced in 2004 whereby the Company
matches A VCs made by employees and Directors up to a maximum of 3 per cent of basic salary.

It is the Company' s policy that service contracts for executive Directors are for an indefinite period terminable by either 
party with twelve months' notice, and that payments in lieu of notice should not exceed the Director' s salary for the 
unexpired term of their notice period. The Company has adopted a policy on mitigation to reduce the payment in lieu 
of notice.  
The interests of the Directors in the Company' s share capital are shown on page 15.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of the non-executive Directors is determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of
Association, based on duties performed, time required and independent surveys of fees paid by comparable companies.
Non-executive Directors have letters of appointment. The Company' s policy is to appoint non-executive Directors for an
initial three-year term subject to the requirements for re-election under the Articles of Association. Non-executive Directors
are not entitled to compensation for loss of office beyond the three month notice period in their letter of appointment. 
The non-executive Directors do not participate in any bonus or share schemes of the Company and are not eligible to
join the Company' s pension scheme.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH
The following graph shows the Company' s performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the
performance of the FTSE techMARK All-Share index.  The Directors believe this to be the most appropriate index for
comparison. It is the benchmark against which performance is measured for the Company' s 1995 share option scheme 
and is an index of which the Company has been a constituent member throughout the period.
The following information has been audited by the Company' s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , as required by
Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985.
DIRECTORS' EMOLUMENTS
The aggregate remuneration of the individual directors for the year ended 31 December 2004 was as follows:

The Committee applied its policy for termination payments in relation to the compromise agreement reached with 
Swag Mukerji on his resignation. A compensation for loss payment was calculated on the basis of his salary and benefits 
for one year. This amount was reduced under the mitigation provisions of the agreement as Mr. Mukerji found alternative
employment. The Committee exercised its discretion under the share option schemes to allow him to exercise his options
during a period of six months following his departure.

Employee Share Option Scheme 2003
For those share options granted after June 2003, the performance condition is that the Total Shareholder Return of the
Company' s shares must outperform the FTSE techMARK mediscience index.  
Executive Share Option Scheme 1995
For those share options granted during and after August 1999, the performance condition is that the total shareholder 
return of the Company' s shares must outperform that of the FTSE techMARK All Share index.
For options granted prior to August 1999, the increase in Total Shareholder Return since the date of grant must be at least 
10 per cent greater than the increase in the Retail Prices index over a period of 3 years from the date of grant.
Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 - Super Options
For super options granted during and after June 2000, participants will be able to exercise their options if the increase in 
the Total Shareholder Return since the date of grant falls within the top quartile of Total Shareholder Return performance 
by the constituents of the FTSE Mid-250 index of companies over the same period.  Super options were created in 1998 
to link higher potential reward for exceptional performance for the most senior executives.
For super options granted before June 2000, participants will be able to exercise their options if, over a period of any 
three months (such period to begin no earlier than three months before the fifth anniversary of the date of grant) the 
average market value of an ordinary share of the Company is at least 350p.
Super options can be exercised after the fifth anniversary of the date of grant but only if the performance criteria 
have been met.
