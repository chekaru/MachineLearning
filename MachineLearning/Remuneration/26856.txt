Directors' Report on Remuneration
This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee (the
Committee ) on behalf of the Board and in accordance with the
provisions of Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 and Schedule
B of the Combined Code (the Code ) issued in June 1998.  The
Committee operates according to the principles outlined in the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority and this report describes
how the Board has applied these Principles of Good Governance
relating to directors' remuneration.  The Committee met on eight
occasions during 2005.
A resolution to approve the Committee's report will be proposed at
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The members of the Committee are Jeremy Curnock Cook
(Chairman), David Hankinson and Sir Thomas Harris, all of whom
are independent non-executive directors of the Company.  Sir Thomas
Harris was appointed to the Committee on 7 February 2006.  No
Committee member has a personal financial interest (other than as a
shareholder) in the matters to be decided.  Attendance at meetings is
set out on page 25 and the Terms of Reference for the Committee are
available on the Company's website www.biocompatibles.com.
Geoff Tompsett, Director of Human Resources, is Secretary to the
Committee and attends the meetings.  Crispin Simon, Chief
Executive, attends meetings at the invitation of the Committee, but is
not present when his own remuneration is being discussed.  The
Committee, in setting executive directors' remuneration, referred to a
survey undertaken by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, an
independent executive remuneration and share schemes consultancy,
on remuneration levels amongst comparator companies.  New Bridge
Street Consultants LLP also provided advice on the policy for the
award of share options and the introduction of new share incentive
plans.   Aon Consulting Limited provided advice to the Committee in
relation to executive directors' pensions.  Aon also provided actuarial,
pension and employee benefit administration services to the
Company.  Pitmans provided legal services to the Company including
advice on employment law.
POLICY ON DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
The Committee's policy on executive directors' remuneration mirrors
the Company's policies on pay and benefits and is subject to regular
review.  This is to set salaries and benefits on the basis of median
levels within the healthcare/biotech sector with the potential to
reward up to the upper quartile of the sector through the annual bonus
plan and share incentive schemes.  The packages are designed to
attract, motivate and retain talented executives.  The main elements of
the remuneration package for executive directors and senior managers
are basic annual salary and associated benefits, performance related
annual bonus, the long term incentive programme and pension
arrangements.  This mix of performance related and non-performance
related remuneration is designed to deliver the right level and balance
of incentive to directors and senior executives.
Salary and Benefits
The Committee sets salaries after consideration of the Company's
performance, market conditions, comparable salaries in peer
companies and the need to reward individual performance.  The
Committee reviews executive directors' basic salaries annually in
December with changes becoming applicable from the start of the
following year.  In addition, salaries are reviewed at the time of the
appointment of new directors to the Board.  The average increase
effective from 1 January 2006 was 3.7%, in line with the guidelines
set across the Company.  The only increase significantly above this
figure was to Ian Ardill, to reflect his development in the Finance
Director role since appointment in the second half of 2004.  Details of
each executive director's remuneration are set out on page 36.   
Executive directors' service contracts, which include details of
remuneration, will be available for inspection at the Annual General
Meeting.  In addition to basic salary, the executive directors receive
the following benefits in kind: car allowance, life assurance, private
medical insurance, pension, health screening and gym membership.
Annual Bonus Payments
The Company's policy is that a substantial proportion of the
remuneration of the executive directors and senior executives should
be performance related.  As described below, executive directors may
earn annual bonus payments (which are non-pensionable) of up to
50% of their basic salary.

Directors' Report on Remuneration
Continued
The Committee establishes the targets annually.  The achievement of
the 2005 annual goals is described in the Operational review on
page 7.  For 2006 the bonus payments are based on the achievement
of predefined goals and the individual weightings of those goals.
2006 Company performance targets were determined at the beginning
of the financial year based on the following criteria:
  Achievement of budgeted sales revenue target.
  Achievement of regulatory filing and product approval goals.
  Commercialisation progress in Asia.
  Achievement of clinical project milestones in specific indications.
  Scale-up of the manufacturing facility.
Each of the business goals is allocated a specific bonus percentage.
The maximum bonus opportunity for executive directors if all goals
are achieved is 35% of base salary.  There is a further bonus
opportunity of up to 15% based on pre-determined personal goals for
the executive directors proportionate to the achievement of the
Company's Bonus Goals. 
If the full bonus opportunity is earned the performance related
element of the executive directors' remuneration (excluding share
awards) will be 30%.  No element of the non-executive directors'
remuneration is performance related.
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLANS
Performance Share Plan
The Company operates a long term incentive plan, the Performance
Share Plan (PSP ).   Shares awarded under the PSP are limited to
one times salary except in exceptional circumstances such as
recruitment to senior positions where the maximum value of shares
awarded is limited to two times salary.   
The awards will vest after three years, subject to a performance
condition based on the Company's Total Shareholder Return (TSR )
against a comparator group comprising the constituents of the FTSE
techMARK All-Share Index of which the Company is a member.
Performance shares will only vest if the Company ranks in the top
half of the ranking table, maximum vesting will only occur if the
Company is in the Upper Quartile.  Vesting is also conditional on an
improvement in the underlying financial performance of Company.
Awards will vest to the extent that the performance condition has
been satisfied at the end of the three-year performance period.  To
the extent that the performance target is not met, the awards will be
forfeited.  Where the TSR ranks between median and upper quartile
after three years the Performance Award will vest pro-rata between
25% and 100%.  Where the TSR ranks below median after three
years the performance target will not have been met and the
Performance Award will lapse.  The relevant TSR figures will be
averaged over the three-month periods preceding the beginning and
end of the performance period.  There is no opportunity for retesting
the performance condition.  The TSR performance condition will be
calculated by independent advisers and verified by the Remuneration
Committee.  Once vested, an award will normally only be capable of
exercise for a period of 6 months.
Measuring the Company's TSR performance against this benchmark
will reward stock market outperformance and will create a good
alignment between the interests of executives and shareholders.  
Executive Share Option Schemes
The 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme and the 1995 Savings-
Related Share Option Scheme are all closed to further membership.
The 2003 Employee Share Option Scheme was closed to further
membership on 23 June 2005.
Share Incentive Plan
The Company also operates a Share Incentive Plan (SIP ).  This is
an Inland Revenue approved plan which was adopted by the
Company at the Annual General Meeting held in June 2005 and
which was launched in October 2005.  It is a share ownership plan
open to all employees with a qualifying period of employment of 12
months.  It takes the form of an annual allocation of Free Shares, a
monthly employee purchase of Partnership Shares, up to a maximum
value of  125 per month, and a 2:1 award of Matching Shares for
each Partnership Share purchased.  The Free and Matching Shares are
held in trust for a minimum of three years and are not subject to any
performance criteria.  Executive directors participate on the same
terms as all other UK employees and details of their share interests
under this plan are given in the table on page 37.

Shareholding
In order to ensure that executive directors' interests are aligned with
those of shareholders, the Company adopted shareholding guidelines
linked to the out-turn of the share based incentive schemes introduced
in June 2005.  Executive directors will be expected to retain no fewer
than 50% of shares net of taxes until a shareholding equivalent to
100% of base salary has been achieved.
PENSION ARRANGEMENTS
Each of the executive directors is a member of the Biocompatibles
Retirement Plan, a money purchase scheme which operates only in
the UK.  The Plan also provides for dependants' pensions and lump
sums on death-in-service.  Contributions by the director and the
Company are based on a percentage of pensionable salary (not
including bonus payments) and vary according to the age of the
director.  No other payments to directors are pensionable.  The normal
retirement age under the Pension Plan for executive directors is 60
years and other employees is 65 years; early retirement is permissible
with Company consent from age 55.  The Committee introduced a
scheme whereby employees and executive directors can elect to
sacrifice all or a proportion of a potential annual bonus payment in
return for Company contributions into the pension scheme.  This
bonus sacrifice scheme will be discontinued following the
introduction of the Finance Act in April 2006 when the restrictions on
employee contributions into a pension scheme are effectively
removed.  An additional voluntary contribution (AVC ) matching
arrangement was introduced in 2004 whereby the Company matches
AVCs made by employees and directors up to a maximum of 3 per
cent of basic salary.

LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT AND SERVICE CONTRACTS
It is the Company's policy that service contracts for executive directors are for an indefinite period terminable by either party with twelve
months' notice, that payments in lieu of notice should not exceed the director's salary for the unexpired term of their notice period, and the
directors' services contracts comply with this policy.  The Company has adopted a policy on mitigation to reduce any payment in lieu of notice.
The Company requires employees and directors to mitigate any payment in lieu of notice.
The interests of the directors in the Company's share capital are shown on page 18.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association, based on duties
performed, time required and independent surveys of fees paid by comparable companies.  Non-executive directors have letters of appointment.
The Company's policy is to appoint non-executive directors for an initial three-year term subject to the requirements for re-election under the
Articles of Association.  Non-executive directors are not entitled to compensation for loss of office beyond the three-month notice period in their
letter of appointment.  The non-executive directors do not participate in any bonus or share schemes of the Company and are not eligible to join
the Company's pension scheme.
PERFORMANCE GRAPH
The following graph shows the Company's performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the performance of the FTSE
techMARK All-Share index.  The directors believe this to be the most appropriate index for comparison.  It is the benchmark against which
performance is measured for the Company's Performance Share Plan and the 1995 share option scheme and is an index of which the Company
has been a constituent member throughout the period.

Performance Share Plan 2005
Following the closure to further membership of the 2003 Employee Share Option Scheme and the introduction of the PSP at the 2005 Annual
General Meeting, a total of 412,500 performance shares were awarded to the executive directors and the most senior executives equating to a
dilution level of 1.17% of the issued share capital.  The maximum award to any one individual was 90% of basic annual salary with an average
award of 69% of basic salary.  
The awards will vest on a prescribed scale subject to the Company's TSR performance over the three year period from grant relative to the
TSR performance of the companies comprising the FTSE TechMARK All-Share Index at the time of grant.  In addition, no part of an award
will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that there has been a satisfactory improvement in the underlying financial performance of the
Company over the performance period.  There is no provision for re-testing. 
The directors' interests in the shares under the PSP are as follows:

25612 PRELIM  5/5/06  12:37 pm  Page 38 Gains made by Directors (audited)
The table (right) shows the gain made by individual directors from the
exercise of share options during 2005.  The gains are calculated as at
the exercise date, although the shares may have been retained.
Employee Share Option Scheme 2003
For those share options granted after June 2003, the performance condition is that the Total Shareholder Return of the Company's shares must
outperform the FTSE techMARK mediscience index.
Executive Share Option Scheme 1995
For those share options granted during and after August 1999, the performance condition is that the total shareholder return of the Company's
shares must outperform that of the FTSE techMARK All Share index.
For options granted prior to August 1999, the increase in Total Shareholder Return since the date of grant must be at least 10 per cent greater
than the increase in the Retail Prices index over a period of 3 years from the date of grant.
Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 Super Options
For super options granted during and after June 2000, participants will be able to exercise their options if the increase in the Total Shareholder
Return since the date of grant falls within the top quartile of Total Shareholder Return performance by the constituents of the FTSE Mid-250
index of companies over the same period.  Super options were created in 1998 to link higher potential reward for exceptional performance for
the most senior executives.
For super options granted before June 2000, participants will be able to exercise their options if over a period of any three months, such period
to begin no earlier than three months before the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, the average market value of an ordinary share of the
Company is at least 350p.
Super options can only be exercised after the fifth anniversary of the date of grant provided the performance criteria have been met.
