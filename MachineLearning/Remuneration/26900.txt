 ANNUAL REPORT 2007
33
This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee 
(the Committee ) on behalf of the Board and in accordance with 
the provisions of Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 and
Schedule B of the Combined Code (the Code ) issued in June 2006.
The Committee operates according to the principles outlined in the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and this report
describes how the Board has applied these Principles of Good
Governance relating to directors' remuneration. The Committee 
met on six occasions during 2007.
A resolution to approve the Committee' s report will be proposed at
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company.
This part of the Directors' Report on Remuneration is unaudited.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The members of the Committee are Sir Thomas Harris (Chairman),
Gerry Brown, Jeremy Curnock Cook and Tony Weir, all of whom are
independent non-executive directors of the Company. David Hankinson
retired from both the Board and the Remuneration Committee on 
25 January 2007. No Committee member has a personal financial
interest (other than as a shareholder) in the matters to be decided.
Attendance at meetings is set out on page 26 and the Terms of
Reference for the Committee are available on the Company' s 
website www.biocompatibles.com.
Geoff Tompsett, Director of Human Resources, is Secretary to the
Committee and attends the meetings. Crispin Simon, Chief Executive,
attends meetings at the invitation of the Committee, but is not present
when his own remuneration is being discussed. The Committee, 
in setting executive directors' remuneration, refers to independent data
including an annual survey undertaken by New Bridge Street
Consultants LLP (New Bridge Street ), an independent executive
remuneration and share schemes consultancy, on remuneration levels
amongst comparator companies. In addition, The Committee confirms
that policies and procedures are in place to monitor the size of awards
actually received.
The Committee appointed New Bridge Street to provide advice on 
the policy for the award of share incentives and contributes on-going
advice in this regard. Aon Consulting Limited (Aon ) provides
advice to the Committee in relation to executive directors' pensions.
Aon also provides actuarial, pension and employee benefit
administration services to the Company, however in the light of 
the nature of advice received, the Committee is of the opinion 
that no potential conflict exists. 
POLICY ON DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
The Committee' s policy on executive directors' remuneration mirrors
the Company' s policies on pay and benefits and is subject to regular
review. This is to set salaries and benefits on the basis of median
levels within the healthcare/biotech sector with the potential to reward
up to the upper quartile of the sector through the annual bonus plan
and share incentive schemes. The packages are designed to attract,
motivate and retain talented executives. The main elements of the
remuneration package for executive directors and senior managers are
basic annual salary and associated benefits, a performance related
annual bonus, the long term incentive programme (the Performance
Share Plan) and pension arrangements. This mix of performance related
and non-performance related remuneration is designed to deliver the
right level and balance of incentive to directors and senior executives.
The principal comparator group used to set remuneration is that
defined by the participants of the Biotechnology Industry
Remuneration Survey published by New Bridge Street Consultants.
Salary and Benefits
The Committee sets salaries after consideration of the Company' s
performance, market conditions, comparable salaries in peer
companies and the need to reward individual performance. The
Committee reviews executive directors' basic salaries annually in
December with changes becoming applicable from the start of the
following year. In addition, salaries are reviewed at the time of the
appointment of new directors to the Board. The average increase
effective from 1 January 2008 was 4.1%, in line with the guidelines
set across the Company. Details of each executive director' s
remuneration are set out on page 37.  
Executive directors' service contracts, which include details of
remuneration, will be available for inspection at the Annual General
Meeting. In addition to basic salary, the executive directors receive
the following benefits in kind: car allowance, life assurance, private
medical insurance, pension, health screening and gym membership.

Annual Bonus Payments
The Company' s policy is that a substantial proportion of the
remuneration of the executive directors and senior executives should
be performance related. The Committee establishes the targets
annually. The achievement of the 2007 annual goals is described in
the Operational Review on page 6.   
For 2008 the bonus payments are based on the achievement of
predefined goals and the individual weightings of those goals. 
Each of the business goals is allocated a specific bonus percentage.
2008 Company/Group performance targets were determined at the
beginning of the financial year based on the following criteria:
  Achievement of budgeted sales revenue target.
  Achievement of a budgeted profit measure.
  Achievement of US regulatory and clinical project milestones.
  Achievement of clinical project milestones in a specific trial.
The maximum bonus opportunity for the chief executive is 100% of
base salary and for the other executive directors 75% of base salary.
Half of this opportunity (50% and 37.5% of base salary respectively)
is based upon the achievement of these Company/Group performance
targets, the other half is based upon the achievement of individual
performance targets.  
The maximum total bonus opportunities for the chief executive and
Group executive directors were increased to these levels from 50% 
of base salary with effect from 1 January 2008. The increases were 
to bring the executive remuneration more into line with other listed
companies; to increase the at-risk compensation directly associated
with performance; and to increase the importance of individual
performance targets in the overall compensation mix. 
If the full bonus opportunity is earned the performance related
element of the executive directors' remuneration (excluding 
share awards) will be between 38% and 45%. No element of the 
non-executive directors' remuneration is performance related.
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLANS
Performance Share Plan
The Company operates a long term incentive plan, the Performance
Share Plan (PSP ). Awards under the PSP take the form of nil cost
options and are subject to a maximum award equivalent to one times
base salary except in exceptional circumstances such as recruitment
to senior positions where the maximum value of shares awarded is
limited to two times salary.  
Awards vest after three years, subject to a performance condition
based on the Company' s Total Shareholder Return (TSR ) 
against a comparator group comprising the constituents of the FTSE
techMARK All-Share Index of which the Company is a member.
Performance shares will only vest if the Company ranks in the top
half of the ranking table, maximum vesting will only occur if the
Company is in the Upper Quartile. Vesting is also conditional on an
improvement in the underlying financial performance of the
Company. Awards will vest to the extent that the performance
condition has been satisfied at the end of the three-year performance
period. To the extent that the performance target is not met, the
awards will be forfeited. Where the TSR ranks between median 
and upper quartile after three years the performance award will vest
pro-rata between 25% and 100%. Where the TSR ranks below median
after three years the performance target will not have been met and
the Performance Award will lapse. The relevant TSR figures will be
averaged over the three-month periods preceding the beginning and
end of the performance period. There is no opportunity for retesting
the performance condition. The TSR performance condition will be
calculated by independent advisers and verified by the Remuneration
Committee. Once vested, an award will normally only be capable of
exercise for a period of 6 months.
Measuring the Company' s TSR performance against this benchmark
rewards stock market outperformance and aligns the interests of
executives and shareholders.

Executive Share Option Schemes  
The 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme, 1995 Savings-Related
Option Scheme and the 2003 Employee Share Option Scheme are
closed to further membership. Any shares acquired from options
achieving their performance conditions are awarded in the form 
of new unissued shares. 
Share Incentive Plan
The Company also operates a Revenue approved Share Incentive 
Plan (SIP ). In September 2006 the Board adopted Schedule 1 to the
Scheme allowing for the grant of Free shares to non-UK employees.
The SIP is a share ownership plan open to all employees with a
qualifying period of employment of 12 months. It takes the form of
an allocation of Free shares not exceeding  3,000 in value in any 
tax year, a monthly employee purchase of Partnership shares, up to 
a maximum value of  125 per month, and a 2:1 award of Matching
shares for each Partnership share purchased. The Free and Matching
shares are held in trust for a minimum of three years and are not
subject to any performance criteria. The Free and Matching shares 
are satisfied through the allocation of new shares issued to the Trust.
Executive directors participate on the same terms as all other UK
employees and details of their share interests under this plan are given
in the table on page 38.
Shareholding
In order to ensure that executive directors' interests are aligned with
those of shareholders, the Company adopted shareholding guidelines
linked to the out-turn of the share based incentive schemes. Executive
directors will be expected to retain no fewer than 50% of shares net of
taxes until a shareholding equivalent to 100% of base salary has been
achieved. 
PENSION ARRANGEMENTS
Each of the executive directors is a member of the Group Stakeholder
Pension Plan which provides retirement benefits and dependants'
pensions. They also benefit from life insurance which provides 
death-in-service benefits of four times basic annual salary.
Contributions by the director and the Company are based on a
percentage of pensionable salary (not including bonus payments) 
and vary according to the age of the director. No other payments 
to directors are pensionable. The normal retirement age under the
Pension Plan for executive directors is 65 years; early retirement 
is permissible with Company consent from age 55.  
An additional voluntary contribution (AVC ) matching arrangement
was introduced in 2004 whereby the Company matches AVCs made
by employees and directors up to a maximum of 3 per cent of 
basic salary.
As a result of the changes affecting taxation and limits on pensions
introduced by the Finance Act 2004 and implemented on 6 April
2006, the Company will offer any employee whose benefits exceed
the Lifetime Allowance (LTA) and consequently decides to opt out 
of the Retirement Plan, the alternative of receiving cash payments
(through PAYE) equal to the missed employer pension contributions
(the amounts paid would be equal to the gross employer pension
contributions netted down for Employer NIC). The policy of the
Company is not to compensate employees for changes in the taxation
treatment of pensions.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the
Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association, based on
duties performed, time required and independent surveys of fees paid
by comparable companies. Non-executive directors have letters of
appointment.  The Company' s policy is to appoint non-executive
directors for an initial three-year term subject to the requirements for
re-election under the Articles of Association and the Companies Act
2006. Non-executive directors are not entitled to compensation for
loss of office beyond the three-month notice period in their letter of
appointment. The non-executive directors do not participate in any
bonus or share schemes of the Company and are not eligible to join
the Company' s pension scheme.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH
The following graph shows the Company' s performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the performance of the FTSE
techMARK All-Share index. The directors believe this to be the most appropriate index for comparison. It is the benchmark against which
performance is measured for the Company' s Performance Share Plan and the 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme and is an index of which the
Company has been a constituent member throughout the period.

It is the Company' s policy that service contracts for executive directors are for an indefinite period terminable by either party with twelve
months' notice, and that payments in lieu of notice should not exceed the director' s salary for the unexpired term of their notice period and the
directors' service contracts comply with this policy. The Company has adopted a policy on mitigation to reduce any payment in lieu of notice.
The Company requires employees and directors to mitigate any payment in lieu of notice.

Performance Share Plan 2005
In 2007 a total of 670,000 performance shares were awarded to the executive directors and the most senior executives equating to a dilution level
of 1.8% of the issued share capital. The maximum award to any one individual was 95% of basic annual salary with an average award of 67% of

Employee Share Option Scheme 2003
For those share options granted after June 2003, the performance condition is that the Total Shareholder Return of the Company' s shares must
outperform the FTSE techMARK mediscience index.  
Executive Share Option Scheme 1995
For those share options granted during and after August 1999 but before June 2003, the performance condition is that the total shareholder return
of the Company' s shares must outperform that of the FTSE techMARK All Share index.
For options granted prior to August 1999, the increase in Total Shareholder Return since the date of grant must be at least 10 per cent greater
than the increase in the Retail Prices index over a period of 3 years from the date of grant.
Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 - Super Options
For super options granted during and after June 2000, participants will be able to exercise their options if the increase in the Total Shareholder
Return since the date of grant falls within the top quartile of Total Shareholder Return performance by the constituents of the FTSE Mid-250
index of companies over the same period.  Super options were created in 1998 to link higher potential reward for exceptional performance for
the most senior executives.
For super options granted before June 2000, participants will be able to exercise their options if over a period of any three months, such period to
begin no earlier than three months before the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, the average market value of an ordinary share of the
Company is at least 350p.
Super options can only be exercised after the fifth anniversary of the date of grant provided the performance criteria have been met.
