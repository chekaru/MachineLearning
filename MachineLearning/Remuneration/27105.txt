 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 23
The Remuneration Committee comprises the two non-executive directors and is chaired by Michael A Kayser, senior independent
non-executive director. The Remuneration Committee advises the board on individual directors' remuneration packages. The
Remuneration Committee met once during the year to 31 December 2012. The Committee has access to independent advice
where it considers it appropriate. The Remuneration Committee considers recommendations from the Chief Executive.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The remuneration policy is set by the board. The Remuneration Committee provides advice to the board on the remuneration
package of each director. Directors take no part in decisions affecting their own remuneration. The main objectives of the
company's executive remuneration policy are to provide remuneration packages that will attract, retain and motivate individuals of
an appropriate calibre and ensure that the interests of the executive directors are aligned with those of the shareholders. The
remuneration of executive directors consists of five elements: basic salary, a significant element of performance-related bonus,
benefits in kind, share based payments and pension provision. Remuneration details for each director are set out on page 26.
BASIC SALARY
The basic annual salary for each of the executive directors is determined by the Remuneration Committee having regard to their
performance and market practice. It is the aim of the Committee to reward directors competitively and on the broad principle that
their remuneration should be based around the median remuneration paid to senior management of comparable public companies,
but also having regard to the financial performance of the Group.
PERFORMANCE-RELATED INCENTIVES
Annual performance-related bonuses are considered and awarded based on the performance of both the individuals and the Group
and are awarded on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee. The amount awarded is determined at the end of the
financial period by the Committee and takes into account the overall financial performance of the Group.
The executive directors waived their rights to receive bonuses in respect of 2012 in support of the Group's growth strategy. Their
bonuses in respect of 2011 had also been waived.
SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
The Remuneration Committee considers that long-term incentives should form an important part of senior executives' remuneration in
order to reward the achievement of the company's growth, thereby aligning the interests of executives with the interests of
shareholders.

SHARE OPTIONS
Until 2010, the Committee considered share options to be the most appropriate type of long-term incentive.
From 2007, the policy of the Remuneration Committee was to grant share options to a selected group of key executives (including the
executive directors) under the terms of the Stanelco plc 2005 Unapproved Share Option Plan, up to a maximum value of 200 per cent of
base salary in any one financial year. On expiration of three years from the date of grant, if the share price of the company's shares is
equal to Xp then 25 per cent of the options will become available for exercise. The proportion of options available will increase pro rata
up to 100 per cent if the share price is Yp or greater. For grants made on 4 July 2007, X and Y were 2.0p and 5.0p respectively. For all
subsequent grants X and Y have been 1.0p and 2.5p respectively.  
Until 2010, the Committee considered that the use of share price targets provided the clearest and simplest alignment between
executive rewards and the returns to shareholders.  
PUBLIC EQUITY PLAN
Biome Technologies plc Public Equity Plan (the PEP ) was approved by shareholders on 14 June 2010. Under the terms of this plan
executives are entitled to share a pool of value which equates to 15% of the increase in the value of the Group, based on total
shareholder return, over and above a minimum hurdle of 10% per annum (non-compounded), over a three or four year period (as
determined by the Remuneration Committee), subject to a financial underpin.
The financial underpin requires the Remuneration Committee to be satisfied at the end of the performance period that the pool of
value to be distributed to the executives is consistent with the Group's underlying performance in respect of (i) growth in earnings,
(ii) profit margins and (iii) gearing. Following a review of the Group's performance against these measures, the Remuneration
Committee may scale back (but not increase) the pool of value to be distributed.  
Once it has been created, the pool of value will then be notionally allocated to participants in the PEP (executives and senior
management) pro rata to the number of points they hold relative to 1,000,000 - being the maximum number of points which may
be awarded under the PEP . 50% of the value so allocated to a participant will potentially be available at the end of the
performance period with the other 50% potentially being available 12 months after the end of the performance period (subject to
continued employment). The distributions are expected to be made in shares.  
On 4 October 2010, the Board entered into an agreement with the chairman which mirrors the terms of the PEP . Under this
agreement, subject to the total shareholder return and financial underpin described above, John Standen will be paid a cash sum
equal to 0.9% of the additional value created in excess of the minimum hurdle rate on the same basis that value can be made
available under the PEP .  
SERVICE CONTRACTS
All directors have service contracts. Each executive director has a service contract that may continue in force until their normal
retirement date. These contracts do not contain provisions for pre-determined compensation that exceeds salary and benefits in
kind for the notice period.
