REMUNERATION REPORT
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of independent non-executive directors of the company.  The following 
directors were members of the Committee for the year ended 31 December 2005.
G Cole (Chairman resigned 15 February 2005)
P Glynn-Jones (Died 9 June 2005)
P Ibbetson (Appointed 29 July 2005)
A Clarke
A Knight (Chairman  appointed 29 November 2005)
The secretary of the committee was Mrs E Edwards who resigned as company secretary on 17 October 2005             
and was replaced by Mrs G Godby, the company secretary. The Committee meets three times a year and 
regularly reviews its policy with the Board to ensure it continues to meet its objectives.  The Committee has 
access to and, from time to time, takes external professional advice.
Remuneration policy
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on executive remuneration policy for adoption by the 
Board and determines specifi c remuneration packages for each of the executive directors on behalf of the 
Board.  Remuneration and benefi ts are set at market levels comparable with companies of similar size and 
scope of activity in order to be able to attract, retain and motivate high calibre individuals.
The Committee's policy is to maintain an appropriate balance between fi xed elements of remuneration (basic 
salary, benefi ts in kind and pension) and performance-related elements and to place much greater emphasis 
on rewarding executives by reference to the group's long-term performance rather than its short-term results.
The Committee and Board encourage directors and staff at all levels to acquire shares in the company and to 
hold them for the longer term.  This sense of ownership is an important element of BioProgress plc's culture 
and of its focus on long-term performance.  As far as possible the group prefers to promote individuals from 
within.  The remuneration received by each of the directors, together with details of share option and warrant 
interests and pension benefi ts, are set out below.
Executive director's remuneration consists of a basic salary together with an annual bonus, benefi ts in kind 
and membership of a pension scheme.  The remuneration components are explained further below.
Basic salary Salaries for executive directors take account of external market data, the individual's  
 responsibilities, experience and performance.  Salaries are reviewed annually.
Annual bonus Annual bonuses are based on performance criteria set by the 
 Remuneration Committee.
Benefi ts in kind Benefi ts in kind comprise membership of private health care and insurance, provision  
 of a fuel and car allowance together with medical and life insurance.
Retirement benefi ts Executive directors participate in the Stakeholder Scheme.  Details of individual  
 directors' pension arrangements are shown in a separate table below.
The service agreement for Richard Trevillion can be terminated by either the relevant executive director or 
the company, provided that at least 12 months notice has been given. The service agreement for Daniel 
Farrow can be terminated by either the relevant executive director or the company, provided that at least 12 
months notice has been given.  Larry Shattles' service agreement was for one year from 1 May 2005 and was 
terminated by the company on 28 November 2005.  13    BioProgress plc - Report And Accounts For The Year Ended 31 December 2005
Non-executive directors
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board and refl ects their anticipated 
time commitment to fulfi l their duties.  Non-executive directors do not receive long-term incentive awards or 
pension provision.  Non-executive directors service agreements can be terminated by either party provided 
that 3 months notice has been given. The non-executive directors act independently and are not involved in 
the day to day operations of the business.
