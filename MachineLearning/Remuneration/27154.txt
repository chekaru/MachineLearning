REMUNERATION REPORT
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of three independent non-executive directors of the company.  The 
following directors were members of the Committee for the year ended 31 December 2006.
A Knight (Chairman)
P Ibbetson 
A Clarke
The Committee meets as appropriate and regularly reviews its policy with the Board to ensure it continues to 
meet its objectives.  The Committee has access to and, from time to time, takes external professional advice.
Remuneration policy
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on executive remuneration policy for adoption by the 
Board and determines specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors on behalf of the 
Board.  Remuneration and benefits are set at market levels comparable with companies of similar size and 
scope of activity in order to be able to attract, retain and motivate high calibre individuals.
The Committee's policy is to maintain an appropriate balance between fixed elements of remuneration (basic 
salary, benefits in kind and pension) and performance-related elements and to place much greater emphasis 
on rewarding executives by reference to the group's long-term performance rather than its short-term results.
The remuneration received by each of the directors, together with details of share option and warrant interests 
and pension benefits, are set out below.
Executive director's remuneration consists of a basic salary together with an annual bonus, benefits in kind 
and membership of a pension scheme.  The remuneration components are explained further below.
Basic salary Salaries for executive directors take account of external market data, the individual's 
responsibilities, experience and performance.  Salaries are reviewed annually.
Annual bonus Annual bonuses are based on performance criteria set by the Remuneration 
Committee.
Benefits in kind Benefits in kind comprise membership of private health care and insurance, provision 
of a fuel and car allowance together with medical and life insurance.
Retirement benefits Details of individual directors' pension arrangements are shown in a separate table 
below.
The service agreements for Richard Trevillion, Steve Martin and Hiral Patel can be terminated by either the 
relevant executive director or the company, provided that at least 12 months notice has been given.  
Non-executive directors
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board and reflects their anticipated 
time commitment to fulfil their duties.  Non-executive directors do not receive long-term incentive awards or 
pension provision.  Non-executive directors service agreements can be terminated by either party provided 
that 3 months notice has been given. The non-executive directors act independently and are not involved in 
the day to day operations of the business. 17    BioProgress plc - Report And Accounts For The Year Ended 31 December 2006      BioProgress plc - Report And Accounts For The Year Ended 31 December 2006     18
