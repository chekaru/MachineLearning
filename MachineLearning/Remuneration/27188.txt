Directors' Remuneration Report
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations which
introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors' remuneration in respect of periods
ending on or after 31 December 2002. The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules
of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good
Governance relating to directors' remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the
report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting at which the financial statements will be approved.
The regulations require the auditors to report to the Company's members on the  auditable part' of the
Directors' remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations). The
report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited Information
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee which is constituted in accordance with the
recommendations of the Combined Code. It consists of three independent non-executive directors: 
Mr J G Salkeld, Mr S J Constantine and myself as Chairman.
Remuneration Policy
The Committee follows certain fundamental principles in deciding levels and forms of remuneration. 
This includes providing a base salary which reflects the stage of development of the Group and aligning
the interests of those executives with those of the shareholders through the use of share options and
bonuses linked to, amongst other things, the development of the Group. The remuneration of the 
non-executive directors is determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association.
Basic Salary
An executive director's basic salary is determined by the Committee during March each year to take
effect from the following April, and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In addition to basic salary, the executive directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, principally private
medical insurance.
Incentive Schemes/Share Options
Executive directors are eligible for an annual profit performance bonus, the amount of which is
determined following an assessment by the Remuneration Committee, based on a number of quantitative
and qualitative factors including the financial position and prospects of the Company at the relevant 
time and the implementation of the strategic plan. The committee view the performance element as
important and accordingly the bonus is determined following strict review. There are no long-term
incentive schemes other than the Share Option Scheme, which are determined in a manner similar to 
the annual profit performance bonus.
The Committee is responsible for supervising the Company's Share Option Scheme in accordance with
the rules approved by shareholders.
Pension Arrangements
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for employees and executive directors.
Performance Graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared
with the performance of the FTSE All Share Index also measured by total shareholder return. The FTSE All
Share Index is considered the most appropriate benchmark against which to measure Group performance.
The graph is prepared on the basis of constituent companies in the Index at a point in time. 20

Directors' contracts
The executive directors' have service contracts with an indefinite term with notice periods of 12 months
in respect of Mr N M T Adams and 6 months in respect of Mr B M Bodeker. The contract date for
Mr N M T Adams and Mr B M Bodeker is the 17th April 2000. In the event of a change of control,
of the Company the notice periods of Mr Adams and Mr Bodeker are extended to two years, 
and this may be treated by the individual as a terminating event. In the event of early termination,
the directors' contracts provide for basic compensation up to a maximum of basic salary for the
notice period.
The Remuneration Committee considers these notice periods to be reasonable and proper and in the
interests of both the Company and the directors, having regard to market conditions and current practice.
Non-Executive Directors
All non-executive directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by
the Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association. The non-executives receive no further fees
for additional work performed for the Company in respect of membership of the Remuneration
Committee and Audit Committee. Non-executive directors participate in the Company's share option
schemes but are not eligible to join the Company's pension scheme.
