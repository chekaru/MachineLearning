Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations which
introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors' remuneration in respect of periods
ending on or after 31 December 2002. The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good
Governance relating to directors' remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the
report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting at which the financial statements will be approved.
The regulations require the auditors to report to the Company's members on the auditable part  of the
Directors' Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations). 
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited Information
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee which is constituted in accordance with the
recommendations of the Combined Code. It consists of three independent non-executive directors:
Mr J G Salkeld, Mr S J Constantine and myself as Chairman.
Remuneration policy
The Committee follows certain fundamental principles in deciding levels and forms of remuneration.
This includes providing a base salary which reflects the current stage of development of the Group and
aligning the interests of those executives with those of the shareholders through the use of share options
and bonuses linked to, amongst other things, the development of the Group. The remuneration of the
non-executive directors is determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association.
Basic salary
The basic salary of executive directors is determined by the Committee generally during March each year
and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In addition to basic salary, the executive directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, principally private
medical insurance.
Incentive Schemes/Share Option Schemes
Executive directors are eligible for an annual profit performance bonus, the amount of which is
determined following an assessment by the Remuneration Committee, based on a number of quantitative
and qualitative factors including the financial position and prospects of the Company at the relevant time
and the implementation of the strategic plan. The Committee view the performance element as important
and accordingly the bonus is determined following strict review.
There are no long-term incentive schemes other than the Share Option Schemes. As the Company is at an
early stage in its development, share options are considered part of overall remuneration and are issued
without pre-conditions. 
The Remuneration Committee has spent considerable time recently considering the remuneration
packages of the two Executive Directors, Nick Adams and Mark Bodeker, and in particular their equity
based incentives. The Committee has concluded that the current share option scheme rules are
somewhat restrictive and inappropriate given the nature of BIOQUELL's business. For example, the
Committee is currently not able to grant Mr Adams any more options as he has reached the four times
salary cap dictated by the rules of the Company's schemes. However the Committee believes strongly
that it is in the best interests of the Company that the two executives remain incentivised by continuing
equity participation in the form of options and the Board is proposing to grant to each of them a one off
grant of special options. In essence these comprise the grant of options over 400,000 ordinary shares in
the Company; those options will only be exercisable if the Company achieves a compound increase in
total shareholder return of 25% per annum over a three year period. This increase is equivalent, assuming
no dividend payments or return of capital, to almost a doubling of the share price in a three year period.
The grant is therefore linked closely to the benefits which shareholders will receive if there is the
necessary increase in the share price. 
Directors' Remuneration Report 18
The executives are effectively given three opportunities to achieve the relevant growth with the increase
being measured in each case over a three year period; the first period commences on the Date of Grant
(which would be on the day the relevant ordinary resolution is passed) and two subsequent three year
periods commencing on the first and second anniversaries of the Date of Grant. You will note that the
options are to be granted at the mid market price of the ordinary shares on 7 April 2004 at 120.5p the
latest practical date prior to the printing and posting of the Report and Accounts and if the relevant
growth is not achieved during the first three year period there is to be an increase of 10% in the base
price for the second period and 20% in respect of the third period.
The options would be granted subject to the general provisions of the Company's unapproved share option
scheme subject to certain modifications which are referred to in the relevant resolution. One point to
which your attention is drawn is that in the event of a successful takeover of the Company the
executives will be entitled to exercise their options notwithstanding that they were not otherwise in a
position so to do e.g. because the relevant growth has not been achieved or the relevant three year
period has not expired.
The options granted will not fall within the general limitations on amounts specified in the unapproved
scheme and resolution 6 also extends the exclusion to the number of shares which may be the subject of
options under the Inland Revenue approved scheme. Any variation to the approved scheme is subject to
Revenue approval and if such approval were not granted, it would not affect the grant of options under
resolution 6.
The Committee is responsible for supervising the Company's Share Option Schemes in accordance with
the rules approved by shareholders.
Pension arrangements
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for employees and executive directors.
Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared
with the performance of the FTSE All Share Index also measured by total shareholder return. The FTSE All
Share Index is considered the most appropriate benchmark against which to measure Group performance.
The graph is prepared on the basis of constituent companies in the Index at a point in time.

Directors' contracts
The executive directors have service contracts with an indefinite term with notice periods of 12 months
in respect of Mr N M T Adams and 6 months in respect of Mr B M Bodeker. The contract date for
Mr N M T Adams and Mr B M Bodeker is 16 April 2000. In the event of a change of control of the
Company, the notice periods of Mr Adams and Mr Bodeker are extended to two years, and this may be
treated by the individual as a terminating event. In the event of early termination, the directors' contracts
provide for basic compensation up to a maximum of basic salary for the notice period.
The Remuneration Committee considers these notice periods to be reasonable and proper and in the
interests of both the Company and the directors, having regard to market conditions and current practice.
Non-executive directors
All non-executive directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by
the Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association. The non-executives receive no further fees
for additional work performed for the Company both in respect of membership of the Remuneration
Committee and Audit Committee. Non-executive directors participate in the Company's Share Option
Schemes but are not eligible to join the Company's pension scheme.
