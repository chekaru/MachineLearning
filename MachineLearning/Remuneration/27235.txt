 Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A 
of the Companies Act 1985. The report also meets the relevant
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority
and describes how the Board has applied the Principles relating 
to directors' remuneration. As required by the Act, a resolution to
approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting
at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company's members
on the  auditable part' of the Directors' Remuneration Report and 
to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for
unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited Information
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee,
which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations 
of the Combined Code. It consists of three independent 
non-executive directors: Mr R E Towner (Chairman), Mr J G Salkeld
and Mr S J Constantine. No director plays a part in any discussion
about his own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The Committee follows certain fundamental principles in deciding
levels and forms of remuneration. This includes providing a base
salary, which reflects the current stage of development of the
Group and aligning the interests of those executives with those 
of the shareholders through the use of share options and bonuses
linked to, amongst other things, the development of the Group.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by
the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association.
Basic salary
The basic salary of executive directors is determined by the
Committee generally during March each year and when an
individual changes position or responsibility. In addition to basic
salary, the executive directors receive certain benefits-in-kind,
principally private medical insurance.
Incentive Schemes/Share Option
Schemes
Executive directors are eligible for an annual performance bonus
based on attaining agreed profit levels and specific non-profit
financial criteria, the amount of which is determined following 
an assessment by the Remuneration Committee, based on a
number of quantitative and qualitative factors including the
financial results and prospects of the Company at the relevant 
time and the implementation of the strategic plan. The Committee
views the performance element as important and accordingly the
bonus is determined following strict review.
There are no long-term incentive schemes other than the Share
Option Schemes. As the Company is at an early stage in its
development, share options are considered part of overall
remuneration and are issued without pre-conditions, with the
exception of the Special Options granted to Mr N M T Adams and 
Mr B M Bodeker in 2004, which are conditional upon cumulative
shareholder return over a three year period.
The Committee is responsible for supervising the Company's 
Share Option Schemes in accordance with the rules approved 
by shareholders.
Pension arrangements
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for
employees and executive directors.

Directors' contracts
The executive directors have service contracts with an indefinite
term with notice periods of 12 months in respect of Mr N M T
Adams and 6 months in respect of Mr B M Bodeker. The contract
date for Mr N M T Adams and Mr B M Bodeker is 16 April 2000.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the notice
periods of Mr Adams and Mr Bodeker are extended to two years,
and this may be treated by the individual as a terminating event.
In the event of early termination, the directors' contracts provide 
for basic compensation up to a maximum of basic salary for the
notice period.
The Remuneration Committee considers these notice periods 
to be reasonable and proper and in the interests of both the
Company and the directors, having regard to market conditions 
and current practice.
Non-executive directors
All non-executive directors have specific terms of engagement
terminatable on three months notice and their remuneration is
determined by the Board within the limits set by the Articles of
Association. The non-executive directors receive no further fees 
for additional work performed for the Company both in respect 
of membership of both the Remuneration Committee and Audit
Committee. Non-executive directors have historically participated 
in the Company's share option schemes, with the last grant of 
such options on 4 October 2001, but are not eligible to join the
Company's pension scheme. The terms of engagement of the 
non-executive directors are available for inspection.
