Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee, which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code. 
It consists of three independent non executive directors: Mr J G Salkeld (Chairman), Mr R E T owner and Mr S J Constantine. T erms of reference 
are available for inspection. No director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration. 
Remuneration policy
The Committee follows certain fundamental principles in deciding levels and forms of remuneration. This includes providing a base salary, 
which reflects the current stage of development of the Group and aligning the interests of those executives with those of the shareholders 
through the use of share options and bonuses linked to, amongst other things, the development of the Group. The remuneration of the 
non executive directors is determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association.
Basic salary
The basic salary of executive directors is determined by the Committee generally during March each year and when an individual changes 
position or responsibility. In addition to basic salary, the executive directors receive certain benefits in kind, principally private medical insurance.
Incentive Schemes/Share Option Schemes
Executive directors are eligible for an annual performance bonus based on attaining agreed profit levels and specific non profit financial criteria, 
the amount of which is determined following an assessment by the Remuneration Committee, based on a number of quantitative and qualitative 
factors including the financial results and prospects of the Company at the relevant time and the implementation of the strategic plan. 
The Committee views the performance element as important and accordingly the bonus is determined following strict review.
There are no long term incentive schemes other than the Share Option Schemes. As the Company is at an early stage in its development, 
share options are considered part of overall remuneration and are issued without pre conditions, with the exception of Special Options 
granted to Mr N M T Adams and Mr B M Bodeker in 2004 and to various senior managers in 2006 and 2007, which are conditional upon 
market based cumulative share price growth over a three year period.
The Committee is responsible for supervising the Company's Share Option Schemes in accordance with the rules approved by shareholders.
Pension arrangements
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for employees and executive directors.

Directors' remuneration report continued
Directors' contracts
The executive directors have service contracts with an indefinite term with notice periods of 12 months in respect of Mr N M T Adams and 6 months 
in respect of Mr B M Bodeker. The contract date for Mr N M T Adams and Mr B M Bodeker is 16 April 2000. In the event of a change of control 
of the Company, the notice periods of Mr Adams and Mr Bodeker are extended to two years, and this may be treated by the individual 
as a terminating event. In the event of early termination, the directors' contracts provide for basic compensation up to a maximum of basic 
salary for the notice period.
The Remuneration Committee considers these notice periods to be reasonable and proper and in the interests of both the Company 
and the directors, having regard to market conditions and current practice.
non-executive directors
All non executive directors have specific terms of engagement terminatable on three months notice and their remuneration is determined by 
the Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association. The non executive directors receive no further fees for additional work performed 
for the Company in respect of membership of either the Remuneration Committee, Audit Committee nor the Nominations Committee. 
Non executive directors have historically participated in the Company's share option schemes, with the last grant of such options on 
4 October 2001, but are not eligible to join the Company's pension scheme. The terms of engagement of the non executive directors 
are available for inspection.
