Directors' remuneration report
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985. The report also meets the relevant requirements 
of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles relating to Directors' remuneration. 
As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting at which the financial statements 
will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company's members on the auditable part  of the Directors' remuneration report and to state 
whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. The report has therefore 
been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION 
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee, which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined 
Code. It consists of three independent non-executive Directors: Mr N J Keen (Chairman), Mr J G Salkeld and Mr S J Constantine. No Director 
plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration. 
Remuneration policy
The Committee follows certain fundamental principles in deciding levels and forms of remuneration. This includes providing a base salary, 
which reflects the current stage of development of the Group and aligning the interests of those executives with those of the shareholders 
through the use of share options and bonuses linked to, amongst other things, the development of the Group. The remuneration of the 
non-executive Directors is determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association.
Basic salary
The basic salary of Executive Directors is determined by the Committee generally during March each year and when an individual changes 
position or responsibility. In addition to basic salary, the Executive Directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, principally private medical insurance.
Incentive schemes/share option schemes
Executive Directors are eligible for an annual performance bonus based on attaining agreed profit levels and specific non-profit financial 
criteria, the amount of which is determined following an assessment by the Remuneration Committee, based on a number of quantitative 
and qualitative factors including the financial results and prospects of the Company at the relevant time and the implementation of the 
strategic plan. The Committee views the performance element as important and accordingly the bonus is determined following strict review.
There are no long-term incentive schemes other than the Share Option Schemes. Share options are considered part of overall remuneration 
and were issued to Executive Directors without pre-conditions until 2003 and thereafter with pre-conditions pertaining to share price (2004 grant) 
or pre-tax profit per share (2008 grant).
The Committee is responsible for supervising the Company's Share Option Schemes in accordance with the rules approved by shareholders.
Pension arrangements
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for its employees and Executive Directors.
Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the performance of the 
FTSE All-share Index also measured by total shareholder return. The FTSE All-share Index is considered the most appropriate benchmark 
against which to measure Group performance. The graph is prepared on the basis of constituent companies in the Index at a point in time.

Directors' remuneration report continued
Directors' contracts
The Executive Directors have service contracts with an indefinite term with notice periods of 12 months in respect of Mr N M T Adams and 
six months in respect of Mr B M Bodeker. The contract date for Mr N M T Adams and Mr B M Bodeker is 16 April 2000. In the event of a 
change of control of the Company, the notice periods of Mr N M T Adams and Mr B M Bodeker are extended to two years, and this may be 
treated by the individual as a terminating event. In the event of early termination, the Directors' contracts provide for basic compensation up 
to a maximum of basic salary for the notice period.
The Remuneration Committee considers these notice periods to be reasonable and proper and in the interests of both the Company and the 
Directors, having regard to market conditions and current practice.
Non-executive Directors
All non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by 
the Articles of Association. The non-executive Directors receive no further fees for additional work performed for the Company in respect 
of membership of either the Remuneration Committee, Audit Committee nor the Nominations Committee. The terms of engagement of the 
non-executive Directors are available for inspection.
