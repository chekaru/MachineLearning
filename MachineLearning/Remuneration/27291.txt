DIrECtOrs' rEmUnEratIOn rEPOrt
IntrODUCtIOn
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006. The report also 
meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles 
of Good Corporate Governance relating to Directors' remuneration. As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed 
at the Annual General Meeting at which the financial statements will be approved.
rEmUnEratIOn COmmIttEE
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee, which consists of three independent non-executive Directors: Nigel Keen (Chairman), 
Simon Constantine and Tony Bourne. Nigel Keen is also Chairman of the Company and as has been described on page 13. The Board considers 
that it is appropriate that he is also chairman of the Remuneration Committee. The committee defines the Company's policy on remuneration, benefits 
and terms of employment. As part of this process, it provides a formal framework for the development of remuneration policy for Executive Directors 
and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual Directors. The Board, as a whole, is responsible for fixing the remuneration of the 
non-executive Directors, including the Chairman.
No Director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
The Committee also reviews and approves general increases in salaries and bonus arrangements for staff. The remuneration policy and practice 
for employees are taken into account when setting remuneration for Executive Directors.
Over the past year the Committee had access to independent, external advisers when required and the Committee sought input from the Chief 
Executive. The Chairman maintains contact with principal shareholders regarding remuneration policy.
rEmUnEratIOn POLICy
The Remuneration Committee has established a policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors and the Board has established a policy 
for the remuneration of the Chairman and the non-executive Directors.
ExECUtIvE DIrECtOrs
The Company has in place an incentive-driven Executive Director remuneration programme that promotes the delivery of the Group strategy, 
seeks to align the interest of Directors and shareholders and reflects the performance of each Director. Overall the remuneration package aims 
to be appropriate to attract, motivate and retain high calibre executives. The Remuneration Committee considers carefully the motivational effects 
of the incentive structure in order to ensure that it is effective and does not have any unintentionally negative impact on matters such as governance 
and environmental and social issues. A significant proportion of total potential rewards are provided through performance-based schemes.
nOn-ExECUtIvE DIrECtOrs
The Company's policy is to appoint Non-Executive Directors to the Board with a breadth of international skills and experience that is relevant to 
the Group's global business. Appointments are made by the Board upon the recommendation and advice from the Nominations Committee.
sErvICE COntraCts
The Executive Directors have service contracts with an indefinite term with notice periods of twelve months in respect of Nicholas Adams 
and six months in respect of Mark Bodeker. The contract date for Nicholas Adams and Mark Bodeker is 16 April 2000. In the event of a change 
of control of the Company, the notice periods of Nicholas Adams and Mark Bodeker are extended to two years, and a change of control may 
be treated by the individual as a terminating event. In the event of early termination, the Directors' contracts provide for compensation up 
to a maximum of base salary for the notice period.
The Remuneration Committee considers these notice periods to be reasonable and proper and in the interests of both the Company and the 
Directors, having regard to market conditions and current practice. The Remuneration Committee's policy on early termination is to provide 
compensation which reflects the Company's contractual obligations, whilst recognising the principle of mitigation of losses.
The non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set 
by the Articles of Association. The non-executive Directors receive no further fees for additional work performed for the Company in respect 
of membership of either the Remuneration Committee, the Audit Committee or the Nomination Committee. 
The terms of engagement of the Directors are available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
ExECUtIvE DIrECtOrs' rEmUnEratIOn
Executive Directors receive base salary, annual performance awards, pension contributions and other benefits and long term performance awards. 
These remuneration programmes for the Executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee and are determined with reference 
to an appropriate comparator group of companies. Consideration is given to the Director's experience, performance and responsibilities. Benefits 
comprise provision of a car or car allowance and life and health insurance.
Emoluments of the current Executive Directors showing the breakdown between basic and performance related remuneration are:

The Executive Directors' bonus scheme for the year ended 31 December 2009 set performance targets which would pay bonuses at a maximum 
of 100% of salary. Bonuses were earned on full year performance. The level of award for the year ended 31 December 2009 took account of achievement 
against specific targets in relation to profit, turnover, cash generation and measurable progress in meeting defined strategic objectives for the Group. 
Bonuses are paid after the completion of the statutory annual audit.
For the financial year to 31 December 2010, the structure of the Executive Directors' bonuses will be similar to that for the year to 31 December 2009.

The Company has the following share options schemes for incentivising Executive Directors and employees of the Group:
  the Executive Share Option Scheme (ESO )
  the Save-As-You-Earn scheme (SAYE )
The ESO scheme is the primary vehicle used to incentivise the Executive Directors and senior management.
EsO scheme
This shareholder and Revenue approved scheme grants options over new shares to be issued at the time of exercise. Options granted to an 
individual in excess of  30,000 are classified as unapproved. The aggregate market value of shares over which options under the ESO scheme 
may be granted to an individual participant in any twelve month period may not normally exceed 1.5 times base salary.
Options are granted at the market value on the date of grant and are exercisable after three years but not more than ten years (unapproved options: 
seven years) from the date of grant.
Performance conditions
The Remuneration Committee considers that imposing performance conditions that require growth in earnings per share (EPS) above a specified 
level will encourage shareholder value creation and improved financial performance. In selecting appropriate targets the Committee takes into 
account both the recent performance of the Company and its projections for future growth. For option awards granted in 2009 the performance 
condition required for the options to vest was that the Group's EPS should increase at a rate of 7.5% per annum over the three year period of the 
option. There is no retesting of performance if the performance condition is not met.
share appreciation rights
Share options that are unapproved can be exercised using the share appreciation rights (SARS ) system. Under SARS, in effect, an option is settled 
by issuing shares at no consideration to the value of the gain on the share option up to the time of exercise. This means that the number of shares 
to which an option holder may become entitled depends on the Company's share price at the time of exercise.
At 31 December 2009 the outstanding options for the Directors under the ESO scheme were as follows:

    1 January Granted/ 31 December price from which

On 29 April 2009 Nicholas Adams and Mark Bodeker each exercised 80,000 options at 107.5 pence. The market price on the date of exercise 
was 114.0 pence per share. 
There have been no variations to the terms and conditions or performance criteria for share options during the year. None of the Directors' share 
options lapsed during the year. 20

ChaIrman
Under an arrangement between the Company and Imperialise Limited, Nigel Keen is retained to act as Chairman of the Company and he must 
account to Imperialise Limited for his services. His current term of appointment commenced on 10 March 2008 and is for three years. In addition 
Imperialise Limited is paid a sum equivalent to the employer's national insurance contributions on these fees as it is responsible for the cost of 
national insurance on payments to Nigel Keen, whereas national insurance contributions in respect of the other non-executive Directors are 
made directly to HMRC. 
InDEPEnDEnt nOn-ExECUtIvE DIrECtOrs
Non-executive Directors are appointed for an initial period of three years with subsequent reviews. They do not have a contract of employment 
and their appointment can be terminated without notice. It is the Board's policy for the Non-Executive Directors to be paid a level of fee that 
reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of the role and is sufficient to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience. 
Non-Executive Directors receive fixed fees agreed by the full Board after reference to similar roles in an appropriate comparator group of companies 
and reimbursement of expenses incurred in attending Board and other meetings.
