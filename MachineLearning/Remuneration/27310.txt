 Overview Business review Corporate governance Financial statements
Bioquell PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2010 17
introduCtion
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006. The report 
also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the 
Principles of the Combined Code relating to Directors' remuneration. As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be 
proposed at the Annual General Meeting at which the financial statements will be approved.
In accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations the four tables setting out the executive and non executive Directors' 
remuneration, pensions and share options contained within the report have been audited; all other information including the statements 
of policy have not been audited.
remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee, which consists of four independent non executive Directors: Nigel Keen 
(Chairman), Tony Bourne, Sir Ian Carruthers and Simon Constantine. Nigel Keen is also Chairman of the Company and as has been described 
in the Statement on Corporate Governance the Board considers that it is appropriate that he is also Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. 
The Committee defines the Company's policy on remuneration, benefits and terms of employment. As part of this process, it provides a 
formal framework for the development of remuneration policy for executive Directors and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual 
Directors. The Board, as a whole, is responsible for fixing the remuneration of the non executive Directors, including the Chairman.
No Director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
The Committee also reviews and approves general increases in salaries and bonus arrangements for employees. The remuneration policy 
and practice for employees are taken into account when setting remuneration for executive Directors.
Over the past year the Committee had access to independent, external advisers when required and the Committee sought input from the 
Chief Executive. The Chairman maintains contact with principal shareholders regarding remuneration policy.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available at www.bioquellplc.com.
remuneration PoLiCy
The Remuneration Committee has established a policy on the remuneration of executive Directors and the Board has established a policy 
for the remuneration of the Chairman and the non executive Directors.
exeCutive direCtors
The Company has in place an incentive driven executive Director remuneration programme that promotes the delivery of the Group 
strategy, seeks to align the interest of Directors and shareholders and reflects the performance of each Director. Overall the remuneration 
package aims to be appropriate to attract, motivate and retain high calibre executives. The Remuneration Committee considers carefully 
the motivational effects of the incentive structure in order to ensure that it is effective and does not have any unintentionally negative impact 
on matters such as governance, the risk profile of the Group and environmental and social issues. A significant proportion of total potential 
rewards are provided through performance based schemes.
non exeCutive direCtors
The Company's policy is to appoint non executive Directors to the Board with a breadth of international skills and experience that 
is relevant to the Group's global business. Appointments are made by the Board upon the recommendation and advice from the 
Nominations Committee.
serviCe ContraCts
The executive Directors have service contracts with an indefinite term with notice periods of twelve months in respect of Nicholas Adams 
and six months in respect of Mark Bodeker. The contract date for Nicholas Adams and Mark Bodeker is 16 April 2000. In the event of a change 
of control of the Company, the notice periods of Nicholas Adams and Mark Bodeker are extended to two years, and a change of control 
may be treated by the individual as a terminating event. In the event of early termination, the Directors' contracts provide for compensation 
up to a maximum of base salary for the notice period.
The Remuneration Committee considers these notice periods to be reasonable and proper and in the interests of both the Company 
and the Directors, having regard to market conditions and current practice. The Remuneration Committee's policy on early termination 
is to provide compensation which reflects the Company's contractual obligations, whilst recognising the principle of mitigation of losses.
The non executive Directors have specific terms of engagement as detailed below and their remuneration is determined by the Board 
within the limits set by the Articles of Association. The non executive Directors receive no further fees for additional work performed for 
the Company in respect of membership of either the Remuneration Committee, the Audit Committee or the Nomination Committee. 
The terms of engagement of the Directors are available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.

performance and responsibilities. Benefits comprise provision of a car or car allowance and life and health insurance.

share inCentive sChemes
The Company has the following share options schemes for incentivising executive Directors and employees of the Group:
  the Executive Share Option Scheme (ESO )
  the Save As You Earn Scheme (SAYE )
The ESO scheme is the primary vehicle used to incentivise the executive Directors and senior management. Overview Business review Corporate governance Financial statements
Bioquell PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2010 19
share inCentive sChemes Continued
ESO Scheme
This shareholder and Revenue approved scheme grants options over new shares to be issued at the time of exercise. Options granted to an 
individual in excess  30,000 are classified as unapproved. The aggregate market value of shares over which options under the ESO scheme 
may be granted to an individual participant in any twelve month period may not normally exceed 1.5 times base salary.
Options are granted at the market value on the date of grant and are exercisable after three years but not more than ten years 
(unapproved options: seven years) from the date of grant.
Performance conditions
The Remuneration Committee considers that imposing performance conditions that require growth in earnings per share (EPS ) 
above a specified level will encourage shareholder value creation and improved financial performance. In selecting appropriate targets 
the Committee takes into account both the recent performance of the Company and its projections for future growth. For option awards 
granted in 2010 the performance condition required for the options to vest was that the Group's EPS should increase at a rate of 7.5% 
per annum over the three year period of the option. There is no retesting of performance if the performance condition is not met.
Share appreciation rights
Share options that are unapproved can be exercised using the share appreciation rights (SAR ) system. Under SAR, in effect, an option 
is settled by issuing shares at no consideration to the value of the gain on the share option up to the time of exercise. This means that the 
number of shares to which an option holder may become entitled depends on the Company's share price at the time of exercise.
At 31 December 2010 the outstanding options for the Directors under the ESO scheme were as follows:

On 19 March 2010 Nicholas Adams and Mark Bodeker exercised 50,000 and 100,000 options respectively at 84.0 pence. The market price 
on the date of exercise was 157.0 pence per share. The gain on exercise for Nicholas Adams was  36,500 and for Mark Bodeker was  73,000.
There have been no variations to the terms and conditions or performance criteria for share options during the year. None of the Directors' 
share options lapsed during the year.
The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 December 2010 was 120.0 pence (2009: 165.0 pence) and the range during the year was 
87.0 pence to 185.0 pence.
Chairman
Under an arrangement between the Company and Imperialise Limited, Nigel Keen is retained to act as Chairman of the Company and he 
must account to Imperialise Limited for his services. His current term of appointment commenced on 10 March 2011 and is for three years. 
In addition Imperialise Limited is paid a sum equivalent to the employer's national insurance contributions on these fees as it is responsible 
for the cost of national insurance on payments to Nigel Keen, whereas national insurance contributions in respect of Tony Bourne and 
Simon Constantine are made directly to HMRC.  20  Bioquell PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2010

indePendent non exeCutive direCtors
Non executive Directors are appointed for an initial period of three years with subsequent reviews. They do not have a contract 
of employment and their appointment can be terminated without notice. It is the Board's policy for the non executive Directors to be 
paid a level of fee that reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of the role and is sufficient to attract individuals with appropriate 
knowledge and experience. Non executive Directors receive fixed fees agreed by the full Board after reference to similar roles in an 
appropriate comparator group of companies and reimbursement of expenses incurred in attending Board and other meetings. The fees 
and expenses paid in relation to the appointment of Sir Ian Carruthers are paid to the South West Strategic Health Authority.
