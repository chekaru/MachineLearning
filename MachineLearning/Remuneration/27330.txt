Directors' remuneration report
introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006. 
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the 
Board has applied the Principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code relating to Directors' remuneration. As required by the 
Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting at which the financial statements will 
be approved.
In accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations the four tables setting out the Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors' remuneration, pensions and share options contained within the report have been audited; all other information including 
the statements of policy have not been audited.
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee, which consists of four independent non-executive Directors: 
Nigel Keen (Chairman), Tony Bourne, Sir Ian Carruthers and Simon Constantine. Nigel Keen is also Chairman of the Company 
and as has been described above the Board considers that it is appropriate that he is also Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. 
The Committee defines the Company's policy on remuneration, benefits and terms of employment. As part of this process, it 
provides a formal framework for the development of remuneration policy for Executive Directors and for fixing the remuneration 
packages of individual Directors. The Board, as a whole, is responsible for fixing the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors, 
including the Chairman.
No Director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
The Committee also reviews and approves general increases in salaries and bonus arrangements for staff. The remuneration 
policy and practice for employees are taken into account when setting remuneration for Executive Directors.
Over the past year the Committee had access to independent, external advisors when required and the Committee sought 
input from the Chief Executive. The Chairman maintains contact with principal shareholders regarding remuneration policy.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available at www.bioquellplc.com.
Remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee has established a policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors and the Board has 
established a policy for the remuneration of the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors.
Executive Directors
The Company has in place an incentive-driven Executive Director remuneration programme that promotes the delivery of the 
Group strategy, seeks to align the interest of Directors and shareholders and reflects the performance of each Director. Overall 
the remuneration package aims to be appropriate to attract, motivate and retain high calibre executives. The Remuneration 
Committee considers carefully the motivational effects of the incentive structure in order to ensure that it is effective and does 
not have any unintentionally negative impact on matters such as governance, the risk profile of the Group and environmental 
and social issues. A significant proportion of total potential rewards are provided through performance-based schemes.
n on-Executive Directors
The Company's policy is to appoint Non-Executive Directors to the Board with a breadth of international skills and experience 
that is relevant to the Group's global business. Appointments are made by the Board upon the recommendation and advice 
from the Nominations Committee.
Service contracts
The Executive Directors have service contracts with an indefinite term with notice periods of twelve months in respect 
of Nicholas Adams and six months in respect of Mark Bodeker. The contract date for Nicholas Adams and Mark Bodeker 
is 16 April 2000. In the event of a change of control of the Company, the notice periods of Nicholas Adams and Mark Bodeker 
are extended to two years, and a change of control may be treated by the individual as a terminating event. In the event 
of early termination, the Directors' contracts provide for compensation up to a maximum of base salary for the notice period.
The Remuneration Committee considers these notice periods to be reasonable and proper and in the interests of both the Company 
and the Directors, having regard to market conditions and current practice. The Remuneration Committee's policy on early 
termination is to provide compensation which reflects the Company's contractual obligations, whilst recognising the principle 
of mitigation of losses.
The Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of engagement as detailed below and their remuneration is determined 
by the Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association. The non-executive Directors receive no further fees for additional 
work performed for the Company in respect of membership of either the Remuneration Committee, the Audit Committee 
or the Nomination Committee. 
The terms of engagement of the Directors are available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting. Bioquell PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Executive Directors' remuneration
Executive Directors receive base salary, annual performance awards, pension contributions and other benefits and long term 
performance awards. These remuneration programmes for the Executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration 
Committee and are determined with reference to an appropriate comparator group of companies. Consideration is given to 
the Director's experience, performance and responsibilities. Benefits comprise provision of a car or car allowance and life 
and health insurance.

a nnual performance incentive bonus
The Executive Directors' bonus scheme for the year ended 31 December 2011 set performance targets which would pay 
bonuses at a maximum of 100% of salary. Bonuses were earned on full year performance. The level of award for the year ended 
31 December 2011 took account of achievement against specific targets in relation to profit, turnover, cash generation and 
measurable progress in meeting defined strategic objectives for the Group. 
For the financial year to 31 December 2012, the structure of the Executive Directors' bonuses will be similar to that for the year 
to 31 December 2011.
Executive Director pension arrangements
Under the terms of their service contracts Nicholas Adams and Mark Bodeker can ask the Company to contribute to a pension plan 
of their own choice. The Company contributed a maximum of 12% of base salary up to 31 March 2011 and a maximum of 15% 
thereafter. Bonus payments are excluded from the contribution calculations. During the year the Company contributed  39,000 
(2010:  32,000) into a pension scheme in respect of Nicholas Adams and  34,000 (2010:  27,000) in respect of Mark Bodeker.

Share incentive schemes
The Company has the following share options schemes for incentivising Executive Directors and employees of the Group:
 the Executive Share Option scheme (ESO)
 the Save-As-You-Earn scheme (SAYE)
The ESO scheme is the primary vehicle used to incentivise the Executive Directors and senior management.
ESO Scheme
This shareholder and Revenue approved scheme grants options over new shares to be issued at the time of exercise. 
Options granted to an individual in excess  30,000 are classified as unapproved. The aggregate market value of shares over 
which options under the ESO scheme may be granted to an individual participant in any twelve month period may not normally 
exceed 1.5 times base salary.
Options are granted at the market value on the date of grant and are exercisable after three years but not more than ten years 
(unapproved options: seven years) from the date of grant.

Performance conditions
The Remuneration Committee considers that imposing performance conditions that require growth in earnings per share (EPS) 
above a specified level will encourage shareholder value creation and improved financial performance. In selecting appropriate 
targets the Committee takes into account both the recent performance of the Company and its projections for future growth. 
For option awards granted in 2011 the performance condition required for the options to vest was that the Group's EPS should 
increase at a rate of 7.5% per annum over the three year period of the option. There is no retesting of performance if the 
performance condition is not met.
Share appreciation rights
Share options that are unapproved can be exercised using the share appreciation rights (SAR ) system. Under SAR, in effect, 
an option is settled by issuing shares at no consideration to the value of the gain on the share option up to the time of exercise. 
This means that the number of shares to which an option holder may become entitled depends on the Company's share price 
at the time of exercise.
At 31 December 2011 the outstanding options for the Directors under the ESO scheme were as follows:

There have been no variations to the terms and conditions or performance criteria for share options during the year. Share options 
granted to Nicholas Adams (400,000 in 2007 and 143,000 in 2008) and Mark Bodeker (400,000 in 2007 and 126,000 in 2008) lapsed 
during the year as the performance criteria for exercise was not met.

Chairman
Under an arrangement between the Company and Imperialise Limited, Nigel Keen is retained to act as Chairman of the Company 
and he must account to Imperialise Limited for his services. His current term of appointment commenced on 10 March 2011 and 
is for three years with a notice period of six months. In addition Imperialise Limited is paid a sum equivalent to the employer's 
national insurance contributions on these fees as it is responsible for the cost of national insurance on payments to Nigel Keen, 
whereas national insurance contributions in respect of Tony Bourne and Simon Constantine are made directly to HMRC. 
independent n on-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial period of three years with subsequent reviews. They do not have a contract 
of employment and their appointment can be terminated without notice. It is the Board's policy for the Non-Executive Directors 
to be paid a level of fee that reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of the role and is sufficient to attract individuals 
with appropriate knowledge and experience. Non-Executive Directors receive fixed fees agreed by the full Board after reference 
to similar roles in an appropriate comparator group of companies and reimbursement of expenses incurred in attending Board 
and other meetings. The fees and expenses paid in relation to the appointment of Sir Ian Carruthers are paid to the South West 
Strategic Health Authority.
