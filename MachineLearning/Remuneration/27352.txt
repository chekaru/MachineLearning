Overview Business review Corporate governance Financial statements
INTRODUCTION
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006. 
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes 
how the Board has applied the Principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code relating to Directors' remuneration. 
As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting at which the 
financial statements will be approved.
In accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations the five tables setting out the Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors' remuneration, pensions and share options contained within the report have been audited; 
all other information including the statements of policy have not been audited.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee, which consists of the five Non-Executive Directors: Nigel Keen 
(Chairman), Tony Bourne, Sir Ian Carruthers, Simon Constantine and Christopher Mills. Nigel Keen is also Chairman of the 
Company and as has been described above in the Corporate Governance Report, the Board considers that it is appropriate that 
he is also Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. The Committee defines the Company's policy on remuneration, benefits 
and terms of employment. As part of this process, it provides a formal framework for the development of remuneration policy 
for Executive Directors and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual Directors. The Board, as a whole, is responsible 
for fixing the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman.
No Director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
The Committee also reviews and approves general increases in salaries and bonus arrangements for staff. The remuneration 
policy and practice for employees are taken into account when setting remuneration for Executive Directors.
Over the past year the Committee had access to independent, external advisers when required and the Committee sought 
input from the Chief Executive. The Chairman maintains contact with principal shareholders regarding remuneration policy.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available at www.bioquellplc.com.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Remuneration Committee has established a policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors and the Board has 
established a policy for the remuneration of the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Company has in place an incentive-driven Executive Director remuneration programme that promotes the delivery of the 
Group strategy, seeks to align the interest of Directors and shareholders and reflects the performance of each Director. Overall 
the remuneration package aims to be appropriate to attract, motivate and retain high calibre executives. The Remuneration 
Committee considers carefully the motivational effects of the incentive structure in order to ensure that it is effective and does 
not have any unintentionally negative impact on matters such as governance, the risk profile of the Group and environmental 
and social issues. A significant proportion of total potential rewards are provided through performance-based schemes.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Company's policy is to appoint Non-Executive Directors to the Board with a breadth of international skills 
and experience that is relevant to the Group's global business. Appointments are made by the Board upon the 
recommendation and advice from the Nominations Committee.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
The Executive Directors have service contracts with an indefinite term with notice periods of 12 months in respect of 
Nicholas Adams and six months in respect of Mark Bodeker. The contract date for Nicholas Adams and Mark Bodeker is 
16 April 2000. In the event of a change of control of the Company, the notice periods of Nicholas Adams and Mark Bodeker 
are extended to two years, and a change of control may be treated by the individual as a terminating event. In the event of 
early termination, the Directors' contracts provide for compensation up to a maximum of base salary for the notice period.
The Remuneration Committee considers these notice periods to be reasonable and proper and in the interests of both the 
Company and the Directors, having regard to market conditions and current practice. The Remuneration Committee's 
policy on early termination is to provide compensation which reflects the Company's contractual obligations, whilst 
recognising the principle of mitigation of losses.
The Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of engagement as detailed below and their remuneration is determined 
by the Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association. The Non-Executive Directors receive no further fees for 
additional work performed for the Company in respect of membership of either the Remuneration Committee, the Audit 
Committee or the Nomination Committee. 
The terms of engagement of the Directors are available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.

ANNUAL PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE BONUS
The Executive Directors' bonus scheme for the year ended 31 December 2012 set performance targets which would pay 
bonuses at a maximum of 100% of salary. Bonuses were earned on full year performance. The level of award for the year 
ended 31 December 2012 took account of achievement against specific targets in relation to profit, turnover, cash 
generation and measurable progress in meeting defined strategic objectives for the Group. 
For the financial year to 31 December 2013, the structure of the Executive Directors' bonuses will be similar to that for the 
year to 31 December 2012.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR PENSION ARRANGEMENTS
Under the terms of their service contracts Nicholas Adams and Mark Bodeker can ask the Company to contribute to 
a pension plan of their own choice. The Company contributed a maximum of 12% of base salary up to 31 March 2011 
and a maximum of 15% thereafter. Bonus payments are excluded from the contribution calculations. During the year 
the Company contributed  43,000 (2011:  39,000) into a pension scheme in respect of Nicholas Adams and  36,000 
(2011:  34,000) in respect of Mark Bodeker.

SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEMES
The Company has the following share options schemes for incentivising Executive Directors and employees of the Group:
 the Executive Share Option Scheme (ESO); and
 the Save-As-You-Earn scheme (SAYE).
The ESO scheme is the primary vehicle used to incentivise the Executive Directors and senior management.
ESO SCHEME
This shareholder and HMRC approved scheme grants options over new shares to be issued at the time of exercise. 
Options granted to an individual in excess  30,000 are classified as unapproved. The aggregate market value of shares 
over which options under the ESO scheme may be granted to an individual participant in any 12 month period may not 
normally exceed 1.5 times base salary.
Options are granted at the market value on the date of grant and are exercisable after three years but not more than 
ten years (unapproved options: seven years) from the date of grant.
PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS
The Remuneration Committee considers that having performance conditions in place that require growth in earnings 
per share (EPS) above a specified level will encourage shareholder value creation and improved financial performance. 
In selecting appropriate targets the Committee takes into account both the recent performance of the Company and 
its projections for future growth. For option awards granted in 2012 the performance condition required for the options 
to vest was that the Group's EPS should increase at a rate of 7.5% per annum over the three year period of the option. 
There is no retesting of performance if the performance condition is not met.
SHARE APPRECIATION RIGHTS
Share options that are unapproved can be exercised using the share appreciation rights ( SAR') system. Under SAR, 
in effect, an option is settled by issuing shares to the value of the gain on the share option up to the time of exercise 
at nil consideration. This means that the number of shares to which an option holder may become entitled depends 
on the Company's share price at the time of exercise.
At 31 December 2012 the outstanding options for the Directors under the ESO scheme were as follows:

There have been no variations to the terms and conditions or performance criteria for share options during the year. Share 
options granted to Nicholas Adams (221,000 in 2009) and Mark Bodeker (194,500 in 2009) lapsed during the year as the 
performance criteria for exercise was not met.
The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 December 2012 was 154.0 pence (2011: 108.0 pence) and the range during the 
year was 108.0 pence to 154.0 pence.
CHAIRMAN
Under an arrangement between the Company and Imperialise Limited, Nigel Keen is retained to act as Chairman of the 
Company and he must account to Imperialise Limited for his services. His current term of appointment commenced on 
10 March 2011 and is for three years. In addition Imperialise Limited is paid a sum equivalent to the employer's national 
insurance contributions on these fees as it is responsible for the cost of national insurance on payments to Nigel Keen, 
whereas national insurance contributions in respect of Tony Bourne and Simon Constantine are made directly to HMRC. 
Nigel Keen's appointment can be terminated by the Company on six months' notice. PAGE HEADER

INDEPENDENT NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial period of three years with subsequent reviews. They do not have 
a contract of employment and their appointment can be terminated without notice. It is the Board's policy for the 
Non-Executive Directors to be paid a level of fee that reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of the role and 
is sufficient to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience. Non-Executive Directors receive fixed 
fees agreed by the full Board after reference to similar roles in an appropriate comparator group of companies and 
reimbursement of expenses incurred in attending Board and other meetings. The fees and expenses paid in relation 
to the appointment of Sir Ian Carruthers are paid to the South West Strategic Health Authority.
