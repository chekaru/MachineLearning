CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
REMUNERATION REPORT
The Remuneration Report constitutes the audited part of the reports of the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee consists of four independent Non-Executive Directors: Nigel Keen (Chairman), Tony Bourne, Sir Ian Carruthers and Simon Constantine 
and Christopher Mills. Nigel Keen is also Chairman of the Company and, as has been described in the Corporate Governance introduction above, the 
Board considers that it is appropriate that he is also Chairman of the Committee. The Committee defines the Company's policy on remuneration, benefits 
and terms of employment. As part of this process, it provides a formal framework for the development of remuneration policy for Executive Directors and 
for fixing the remuneration packages of individual Directors. The Board, as a whole, is responsible for fixing the remuneration of the Non-Executive 
Directors, including the Chairman.
The Committee has access to independent, external advisers when required but did not seek external advice during the year ended 31 December 2013. 
The Committee sought input from the Chief Executive on remuneration of senior staff. The Chairman maintains contact with principal shareholders 
regarding remuneration policy.
SINGLE TOTAL FIGURE OF REMUNERATION FOR EACH DIRECTOR
The single total figure of remuneration, executive pension costs, annual bonus, Directors' options over shares and statements of Directors' share 
interests have been audited by Deloitte LLP.

contribution to the Group and to the success of the Group, and that reward should be competitive in the market without paying more than is necessary 
to recruit and retain individuals. Reward packages differ taking into account location, seniority and level of responsibility, but they are all built around 
these common reward objectives and principles.
STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The Remuneration Committee, through the Chairman, continues to have a dialogue with shareholders. The views of all shareholders are considered,
