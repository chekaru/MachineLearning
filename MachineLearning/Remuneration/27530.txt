Page 18
The Board is pleased to present the Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2003.
The board of directors is responsible for reviewing the remuneration of the directors and senior employees. Given the increased size of 
your company, it was considered appropriate to form a separate remuneration committee of the board in November 2003, with effect from 
1 January 2004. With this exception the company has complied with section A of the best practice provisions annexed to the Listing Rules of
the Financial Services Authority and given full consideration to section B of such best practice. The Board does not currently use advisers on
remuneration issues. 
Remuneration policy for executive directors and senior employees
The company's policy is to ensure that the executive directors and senior employees are rewarded competitively in relation to other companies
in order to retain and motivate them. The emoluments of the executive directors comprise basic salary, discretionary bonus, provision of a car,
premiums paid in respect of individual defined contribution pension arrangements, health insurance, life assurance premiums and share options.
Service and employment contracts
The full time executive directors have contracts of employment with the company, which are subject to three months' notice. The Chairman is
entitled to six months notice. Non-executive directors have contracts of service, all of which are subject to three months' notice. All directors
contracts, as amended from time to time, have run from the date of appointment. No director has a contract of employment or contract of
service with the company, its joint venture or associated companies which exceeds twelve months duration. The directors offering themselves
for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting do not have a contract of employment or service with a notice period of more
than six months.  No contracts of employment or contracts of service have clauses specifying termination payments. Directors being re-elected
and elected at the AGM are C A Joll, who has a contract of service determinable at three months notice and T M Kearney who has a contract
of employment determinable at three months notice.
Pension and share options
One director has benefits under a money purchase pension scheme. Contributions in 2003 were  15,000 (2002 -  17,000). There is a share
option scheme under which options were issued to a director and an employee during 2002. Further details of the share option scheme are
set out below. Directors are not entitled to benefits under any other bonus or incentive schemes, however bonuses are awarded by the board
when merited. A performance related bonus was paid to a director in November 2003.
Non-executive directors
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the board, and takes into account additional remuneration for services outside
the scope of the ordinary duties of non-executive directors. No pension costs are incurred on behalf of non-executive directors and they do
not participate in the share option schemes.

Share option scheme
The company has an Unapproved Share Option Scheme which was approved by shareholders on 15 June 1999 and which is not
subject to the Inland Revenue terms of approval. The executive director and an employee were granted options to subscribe for
ordinary shares under the scheme during 2003 as follows:
The exercise of options under the Unapproved Share Option Scheme is subject to the satisfaction of objective performance conditions
specified by the Board, which will conform to institutional shareholder guidelines and best practice provisions in force from time to time.
The Board has not yet set these guidelines for the scheme. 
The middle market price of Bisichi Mining PLC ordinary shares at 31 December 2003 was 75.0p (2002 - 34.5p).
During the year the share price ranged between 34.5p and 86.0p.
The following information is unaudited:
The board's policy is to grant options to executive directors, managers and staff at appropriate times to provide them with an interest in
the longer term development of the group.
The Remuneration Report Regulations require us to provide a graph comparing the Total Shareholder Return of a hypothetical holding of
shares in the company with a broad equity market index over a five year period. The directors have chosen the FTSE All Share - Total
Return Index as a suitable index for this comparison as it gives an indication of performance against a large spread of quoted companies.
