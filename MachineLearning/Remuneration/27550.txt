Remuneration report
The remuneration committee is pleased to present its report for the year ended 31 December 2004.
The remuneration committee is a formally constituted committee and is comprised exclusively of non-executive directors. The members of the committee
are Christopher Joll (chairman) and John Sibbald.
Remuneration policy for executive directors and non-executive directors 
The principal function of the remuneration committee is to determine, on behalf of the board, the remuneration and other benefits of the executive
directors and senior executives, including pensions, share options and service contracts. The company's policy is to ensure that the executive directors are
rewarded competitively in relation to other companies in order to retain and motivate them. The emoluments of each executive director comprises basic
salary, a bonus at the discretion of the remuneration committee, provision of a car, premiums paid in respect of individual defined contribution pension
arrangements, health insurance premium and share options. 
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the board, and takes into account additional remuneration for services outside the scope
of the ordinary duties of non-executive directors. No pension costs are incurred on behalf of non-executive directors and they do not participate in the
share option schemes.
Service and employment contracts
All executive directors have full time contracts of employment with the company. Non-executive directors have contracts of service. No director has a
contract of employment or contract of service with the company, its joint venture or associated companies with a fixed term which exceeds twelve
months. All directors' contracts, as amended from time to time, have run from the date of appointment. Details of the directors standing for re-election
are given under  Directors' in the directors' report.
The policy is not to grant employment contracts or contracts of service in excess of six months and there are no provisions for termination payments. A

The remuneration committee has not yet set these guidelines for the first scheme, and performance conditions for the second scheme will be proposed
at a forthcoming general meeting.

The board's policy is to grant options to executive directors, managers and staff at appropriate times to provide them with an interest in the longer term
development of the group.
The following graph illustrates the company's performance compared with a broad equity market index over a five year period.
Performance is measured by total shareholder return. The directors have chosen the FTSE All Share - Total Return Index as a suitable index for this 
comparison as it gives an indication of performance against a large spread of quoted companies.
