Remuneration report
The remuneration committee is pleased to present its report for the year ended 31 December 2005.
The remuneration committee is a formally constituted committee and is comprised exclusively of non-executive directors. The members of
the committee are Christopher Joll (chairman) and John Sibbald.
Remuneration policy for executive directors and non-executive directors
The principal function of the remuneration committee is to determine, on behalf of the board, the remuneration and other benefits of the
executive directors and senior executives, including pensions, share options and service contracts. The company's policy is to ensure that the
executive directors are rewarded competitively in relation to other companies in order to retain and motivate them. The emoluments of each
executive director comprise basic salary, a bonus at the discretion of the remuneration committee, provision of a car, premiums paid in
respect of individual defined contribution pension arrangements, health insurance premium and share options. 
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the board, and takes into account additional remuneration for services outside
the scope of the ordinary duties of non-executive directors. No pension costs are incurred on behalf of non-executive directors and they do
not participate in the share option schemes.
Service and employment contracts
All executive directors have full time contracts of employment with the company. Non-executive directors have contracts of service. No
director has a contract of employment or contract of service with the company, its joint venture or associated companies with a fixed term
which exceeds twelve months. All directors' contracts, as amended from time to time, have run from the date of appointment. Details of the
directors standing for re-election are given under  Directors' in the directors' report.
The policy is not to grant employment contracts or contracts of service in excess of six months and there are no provisions for termination
payments. A summary of terms of service and employment is as follows:
