Remuneration policy for executive directors and non-executive directors
The principal function of the remuneration committee is to determine, on behalf of the board, the remuneration and other benefits of the executive
directors and senior executives, including pensions, share options and service contracts. The company's policy is to ensure that the executive directors
are rewarded competitively in relation to other companies in order to retain and motivate them. The emoluments of each executive director comprises
basic salary, a bonus at the discretion of the remuneration committee, provision of a car, premiums paid in respect of individual defined contribution
pension arrangements, health insurance premium and share options.

a contract of employment or contract of service with the company, its joint venture or associated companies with a fixed term which exceeds six months.

under 'Directors' in the directors' report. The policy of the committee is not to grant employment contracts or contracts of service in excess of six months
