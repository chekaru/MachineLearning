Remuneration policy for executive directors and non-executive directors
The principal function of the remuneration committee is to determine, on behalf of the board, the remuneration and other benefits of
the executive directors and senior executives, including pensions, share options and service contracts. The company's policy is to

The emoluments of each executive director comprises basic salary, a bonus at the discretion of the remuneration committee, provision
of a car, premiums paid in respect of individual defined contribution pension arrangements, health insurance premium and share options. 
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the board, and takes into account additional remuneration for services
outside the scope of the ordinary duties of non-executive directors. No pension costs are incurred on behalf of non-executive directors
and they do not participate in the share option schemes.
Service and employment contracts
All executive directors have full time contracts of employment with the company. Non-executive directors have contracts of service. 
No director has a contract of employment or contract of service with the company, its joint venture or associated companies with a
fixed term which exceeds six months. All directors' contracts, as amended from time to time, have run from the date of appointment.
Details of the directors standing for re-election are given under 'Directors' in the directors' report. The policy of the committee is not 
to grant employment contracts or contracts of service in excess of six months and there are no provisions for termination payments.
