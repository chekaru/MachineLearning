The remuneration committee is pleased to present its 
report for the year ended 31 December 2010. 
The remuneration committee is a formally constituted committee 
and is comprised exclusively of non-executive directors. 
The members of the committee are Christopher Joll (chairman) 
and John Sibbald.
Remuneration policy for executive directors  
and non-executive directors  
The principal function of the remuneration committee is to 
determine, on behalf of the Board, the remuneration and other 
benefits of the executive directors and senior executives, 
including pensions, share options and service contracts. The 
company's policy is to ensure that the executive directors are 
rewarded competitively in relation to other companies in order 
to retain and motivate them. The emoluments of each executive 
director comprises basic salary, a bonus at the discretion of the 
remuneration committee, provision of a car, premiums paid in 
respect of individual defined contribution pension arrangements, 
health insurance premium and share options. 
The remuneration committee receives updates on pay and 
employment conditions applying to other group employees. 
These are taken into consideration when setting executive 
directors' remuneration consistent with the group's general aim 
of seeking to reward all employees fairly according to the nature 
of their role, their performance and market forces.
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined 
by the board, and takes into account additional remuneration 
for services outside the scope of the ordinary duties of non-
executive directors. No pension costs are incurred on behalf of 
non-executive directors and they do not participate in the share 
option schemes.
Service and employment contracts  
All executive directors have full time contracts of employment 
with the company. Non-executive directors have contracts of 
service. No director has a contract of employment or contract 
of service with the company, its joint venture or associated 
companies with a fixed term which exceeds six months. All 
directors' contracts, as amended from time to time, have run 
from the date of appointment. Details of the directors standing 
for re-election are given under  Directors' in the Directors' report. 
The policy of the committee is not to grant employment contracts 
or contracts of service in excess of six months and there are 
no provisions for termination payments. A summary of terms of 
service and employment is as follows:

Share option schemes
The company has three Unapproved  Share Option Schemes 
which are not subject to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) 
approval. The First Scheme  was approved by shareholders 
on 15 June 1999. The Second Scheme  was approved by 
shareholders on 23 June 2005, options having been provisionally 
granted under it on 23 September 2004, and the 2006 
Scheme  was approved by shareholders on 29 June 2006. 
Shareholder approval will be sought for the grant of an option, 
the 2010 scheme  also not subject to HMRC approval, at the 
Annual General Meeting to be held on Tuesday 7 June 2011, the 
option having been conditionally granted on 31 August 2010. All 
available options under each of the Schemes have been granted.
No consideration is payable for the grant of options under the 
Unapproved Share Option Scheme or for the option granted 
under the 2010 Scheme, if approved by members on 7 June 
2011.The exercise of options under the Unapproved Share 
Option Schemes is subject to the satisfaction of objective 
performance conditions specified by the remuneration committee, 
which will conform to institutional shareholder guidelines and best 
practice provisions in force from time to time. The remuneration 
committee has not yet set these guidelines for the First Scheme 
and the 2006 Scheme. The performance conditions for the 
Second Scheme, agreed by members on 23 June 2005, requires 
growth in net assets over a three year period to exceed the 
growth in the retail price index by a scale of percentages. The 
performance conditions for the option granted under the 2010 
Scheme, if approved by members on 7 June 2011, requires 
growth in group net assets over a three year period to exceed 
growth in the retail price index by a scale of percentages more 
information on this can be found in the explanatory notes to the 
AGM at pages 61 to 62 of this document.
The middle market price of Bisichi Mining PLC ordinary shares at 
31 December 2010 was 200p (2009-175p). During the year the 
share price ranged between 171p and 204p.
The following information is unaudited:  
The board's policy is to grant options to executive directors, 
managers and staff at appropriate times to provide them with  
an interest in the longer term development of the group.
The following graph illustrates the company's performance 
compared with a broad equity market index over a five year 
period. Performance is measured by total shareholder return. The 
directors have chosen the FTSE All Share - Total Return Index as 
a suitable index for this comparison as it gives an indication of 
performance against a large spread of quoted companies.
