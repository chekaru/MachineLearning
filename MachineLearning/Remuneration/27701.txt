The remuneration committee is a formally constituted committee  
and is comprised exclusively of non-executive directors. 
The members of the committee are Christopher Joll (chairman) and 
John Sibbald.
Remuneration policy for executive directors and  
non-executive directors  
The principal function of the remuneration committee is to determine, on 
behalf of the Board, the remuneration and other benefits of the executive 
directors and senior executives, including pensions, share options and 
service contracts. The company' s policy is to ensure that the executive 
directors are rewarded competitively in relation to other companies in 
order to retain and motivate them. The emoluments of each executive 
director comprises basic salary, a bonus at the discretion of the 
remuneration committee, provision of a car, premiums paid in respect 
of individual defined contribution pension arrangements, health 
insurance premium and share options. 
The remuneration committee receives updates on pay and employment 
conditions applying to other group employees. These are taken 
into consideration when setting executive directors' remuneration 
consistent with the group's general aim of seeking to reward 
all employees fairly according to the nature of their role, their 
performance and market forces.
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the 
board, and takes into account additional remuneration for services 
outside the scope of the ordinary duties of non-executive directors. 
No pension costs are incurred on behalf of non-executive directors 
and they do not participate in the share option schemes.
Service and employment contracts  
All executive directors have full time contracts of employment with 
the company. Non-executive directors have contracts of service. No 
director has a contract of employment or contract of service with 
the company, its joint venture or associated companies with a fixed 
term which exceeds six months. All directors' contracts, as amended 
from time to time, have run from the date of appointment. Details 
of the directors standing for re-election are given under  Directors' 
in the Directors' report. The policy of the committee is not to grant 
employment contracts or contracts of service in excess of six months 
and there are no provisions for termination payments. A summary of

No consideration is payable for the grant of options under the 
Unapproved Share Option Scheme or for the option granted under the 
2010 Scheme. The exercise of options under the Unapproved Share 
Option Schemes is subject to the satisfaction of objective performance 
conditions specified by the remuneration committee, which will conform 
to institutional shareholder guidelines and best practice provisions in 
force from time to time. The remuneration committee has not yet set 
these guidelines for the First Scheme and the 2006 Scheme. The 
performance conditions for the Second Scheme, agreed by members on 
23 June 2005, requires growth in net assets over a three year period to 
exceed the growth in the retail price index by a scale of percentages. The 
performance conditions for the option granted under the 2010 Scheme, 
requires growth in group net assets over a three year period to exceed 
growth in the retail price index by a scale of percentages.

The following information is unaudited:  
The board's policy is to grant options to executive directors, 
managers and staff at appropriate times to provide them with an 
interest in the longer term development of the group.  
The following graph illustrates the company's performance compared 
with a broad equity market index over a five year period. Performance 
is measured by total shareholder return. The directors have chosen 
the FTSE All Share - Total Return Index as a suitable index for this 
comparison as it gives an indication of performance against a large 
spread of quoted companies.
