 The remuneration committee is pleased 
to present its report for the year ended 
31 December 2012 
The remuneration committee is a formally 
constituted committee and is comprised 
exclusively of non-executive directors. 
The members of the committee are 
Christopher Joll (chairman) and John Sibbald.
Remuneration policy for executive 
directors and non-executive directors
The principal function of the remuneration 
committee is to determine, on behalf of the 
Board, the remuneration and other benefits of 
the executive directors and senior executives, 
including pensions, share options and service 
contracts. The company's policy is to ensure 
that the executive directors are rewarded 
competitively in relation to other companies 
in order to retain and motivate them. The 
emoluments of each executive director 
comprises basic salary, a bonus 
at the discretion of the remuneration committee, 
provision of a car, premiums paid in respect of 
individual defined contribution pension 
arrangements, health insurance premium 
and share options. 
The remuneration committee receives updates 
on pay and employment conditions applying to 
other group employees. These are taken into 
consideration when setting executive directors' 
remuneration consistent with the group's 
general aim of seeking to reward all employees 
fairly according to the nature of their role, their 
performance and market forces.
The remuneration of non-executive directors is 
determined by the board, and takes into 
account additional remuneration for services 
outside the scope of the ordinary duties of 
non-executive directors. No pension costs are 
incurred on behalf of non-executive directors 
and they do not participate in the share option 
schemes.
Service and employment contracts
All executive directors have full time contracts 
of employment with the company. Non-
executive directors have contracts of service. 
No director has a contract of employment or 
contract of service with the company, its joint 
venture or associated companies with a fixed 
term which exceeds six months. All directors' 
contracts, as amended from time to time, have 
run from the date of appointment. Details of 
the directors standing for re-election are given 
under Directors'  in the Directors' report. 
The policy of the committee is not to grant 
employment contracts or contracts of service 
in excess of six months and there are no 
provisions for termination payments. 
A summary of terms of service and 
employment is as follows:

Share option schemes 
The Company currently has four Unapproved  
Share Option Schemes which are not subject 
to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) 
approval. The Second Scheme  was 
approved by shareholders on 23 June 2005, 
options having been provisionally granted 
under it on 23 September 2004. The 2006 
Scheme  was approved by shareholders on 
29 June 2006, and the 2010 Scheme  was 
approved by shareholders on 7 June 2011. 
The 2012 Scheme  was approved by the 
remuneration committee of the Company on 
28 September 2012 in replacement of a 
scheme which was adopted on 15 June 1999 
(the First Scheme ). Existing options over 
ordinary shares granted under the First 
Scheme lapsed on 29 September 2012. 
Replacement options could not be granted 
under the First Scheme as the period for new 
grants under the scheme had expired. 
Accordingly, the remuneration committee 
approved the adoption by the Company of the 
2012 Scheme with similar rules to the First 
Scheme. All available options under each 
of the Schemes have been granted.
