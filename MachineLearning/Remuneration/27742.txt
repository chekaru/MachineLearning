 The remuneration committee presents its 
report for the year ended 31 December 
2013, which this year is presented in two 
parts in accordance with the new 
regulations.
The first part, is the Annual Remuneration 
Report which details remuneration awarded 
to directors and non-executive directors 
during the year. The shareholders will be 
asked to approve the Annual Remuneration 
Report as an ordinary resolution (as in 
previous years) at the AGM in June 2014.
The second part, is the Remuneration Policy 
Report which details the remuneration policy 
for directors. This policy is subject to a 
binding vote by shareholders at the AGM in 
2014, and if approved will apply for a 3 year 
period commencing 11 June 2014. The 
policy is very much in line with the previous 
policy although the level of disclosure has 
increased in accordance with the new 
regulations. The remuneration committee 
reviewed the existing policy and deemed no 
changes necessary to the current 
arrangements.
Both of the above reports have been 
prepared in accordance with The Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013.
The Company's auditors, BDO LLP are 
required by law to audit certain disclosures 
and where disclosures have been audited 
they are indicated as such.
