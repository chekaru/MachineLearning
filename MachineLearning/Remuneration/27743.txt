Share option schemes
The Company currently has four Unapproved  Share Option Schemes which are not subject to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) approval. 
The Second Scheme  was approved by shareholders on 23 June 2005, options having been provisionally granted under it on 23 September 
2004. The 2006 Scheme  was approved by shareholders on 29 June 2006, and the 2010 Scheme  was approved by shareholders on 7 June 
2011. The 2012 Scheme  was approved by the remuneration committee of the Company on 28 September 2012 in replacement of a scheme 
which was adopted on 15 June 1999 (the First Scheme ). Existing options over ordinary shares granted under the First Scheme lapsed on 29 
September 2012. Replacement options could not be granted under the First Scheme as the period for new grants under the scheme had 
expired. Accordingly, the remuneration committee approved the adoption by the Company of the 2012 Scheme with similar rules to the First 
Scheme. All available options under each of the Schemes have been granted.
