 Directors' Remuneration Report
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is chaired by Mr. D Horne and its other member is Mr. I Edward. 
Remuneration Policy
The committee recommends an overall remuneration package for executive directors in order to attract and retain high quality executives capable of
achieving the group's objectives. Consideration is given to pay and employment policies elsewhere in the group and market place in general, especially
when recommending annual salary increases. The details of the individual components of the remuneration package and service contracts are
disclosed below. The package comprises basic salary, benefits, share options, performance related bonuses and pensions, as follows: 
Basic salary and benefits: The salary and benefits are reviewed annually. For the year under review the directors did not receive an increase in the
current year. Benefits principally comprise private healthcare and private petrol.
Share options: As an incentive to staff, options may be granted by the remuneration committee following the recommendations from management
based on the staff member's performance. The remuneration committee may grant options to directors from time to time, but will only allow their
exercise if certain performance criteria are met. The maximum number of shares that may be awarded in a 10 year period is an amount equating to
the greater of 4 times total salary or  100,000 in that period. Options granted to the directors during the year are noted in the  interest in options' on
page 6. The exercise price of options granted is the higher of the nominal value of the shares and either the middle market quotation for the
immediately preceding dealing day or, if the committee so determines, the average middle market quotation for the three immediately preceding
dealing days.
Performance related bonuses: These exist for Mr. A Edward, Mr. M Edward and Mr. R Waxman, and form part of their service contracts. Mr. A Edward
and Mr. M Edward's bonuses are calculated by reference to a percentage of the net profit, excluding revaluation gains and defined benefit pension
fund gains or losses, before taxation. Mr R Waxman's bonus is calculated by reference to stepped percentages of the net profit, excluding revaluation
gains and defined benefit pension fund gains or losses, before taxation. None of these bonuses is subject to any cap. There were no long term
incentives for the directors in office during the financial year ended 31 March 2008.
Pensions: Mr. A Edward and Mr. M Edward are above pensionable age and the company no longer pays any contributions to their private pensions,
and they were never a member of the group defined benefit scheme. All pension benefits have been transferred out and no benefit was accrued to
either at 31 March 2008. The company paid a flat rate contribution into an Executive pension plan for Mr. R Waxman.
Fees: The fees for non- executive directors are determined by the board. The non-executive directors are not involved in any discussions or decisions
about their own remuneration.
Service contracts: 
Mr. A Edward, Mr. M Edward and Mr. R Waxman have rolling service agreements dated 1 April 2004 with notice periods of one year. There are no
specific compensation provisions contained in these contracts, but termination by one party without the agreement of the other will give rise to a claim
for damages.
Mr. I Edward and Mr. D Horne do not have service contracts. Mr. I Edward's letter of appointment was dated 1 April 1995 and Mr. D.Horne's letter of
appointment was dated 1 April 1993. Neither directors' letter contained fixed terms of service.
Mr. I Edward and Mr. M Edward are require to retire by rotation and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. 
Mr. P Edward and Mr. R Pelham were appointed on 1 April 2008 and are required to retire in accordance with the Articles of association and, being
eligible, offer themselves for themselves for re-election.
