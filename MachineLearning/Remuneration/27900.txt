 Directors' Remuneration Report
for the year ended 31 March 2009
Remuneration committee     
The remuneration committee is chaired by Mr. D Horne and its other member is Mr. I Edward.      
     
R e m u n e r a t i o n 	 p o l i c y 	 	 	 	 	
The committee recommends an overall remuneration package for executive directors in order to attract and retain high quality executives capable of 
achieving the Group's objectives. Consideration is given to pay and employment policies elsewhere in the Group and market place in general, especially 
when recommending annual salary increases. The details of the individual components of the remuneration package and service contracts are disclosed 
below. The package comprises basic salary, benefits, share options, performance related bonuses and pensions, as follows:    
 
B a s i c 	 s a l a r y 	 a n d 	 b e n e f i t s : The salary and benefits are reviewed annually. For the year under review the directors did not receive an increase in the 
current year. Benefits principally comprise private healthcare and private petrol.     
     
S h a r e 	 o p t i o n s : As an incentive to staff, options may be granted by the remuneration committee following the recommendations from management 
based on the staff member's performance. The remuneration committee may grant options to directors from time to time, but will only allow their 
exercise if certain performance criteria are met. The maximum number of shares that may be awarded in a 10 year period is an amount equating to 
the greater of 4 times total salary or  100,000 in that period. Options granted to the directors during the year are noted in the  interest in options' on  
page 6. The exercise price of options granted is the higher of the nominal value of the shares and either the middle market quotation for the immediately 
preceding dealing day or, if the committee so determines, the average middle market quotation for the three immediately preceding dealing days. 
 
P e r f o r m a n c e 	 r e l a t e d 	 b o n u s e s : These exist for Mr. A Edward, Mr. M Edward and Mr. R Waxman, and form part of their service contracts. Mr. A Edward 
and Mr. M Edward's bonuses are calculated by reference to a percentage of the net profit, excluding revaluation gains and defined benefit pension fund 
gains and losses, before taxation. Mr R Waxman's bonus is calculated by reference to stepped percentages of the net profit excluding revaluation gains 
and defined benefit pension fund gains and losses, before taxation. None of these bonuses is subject to any cap. There were no long term incentives 
for the directors in office during the financial year ended 31 March 2009.     
P e n s i o n s : Mr. A Edward and Mr. M Edward are above pensionable age and the Company no longer pays any contributions to their private pensions, 
and they were never a member of the Group defined benefit pension scheme. All pension benefits have been transferred out and no benefit was accrued 
to either director at 31 March 2009. The Company paid a flat rate contribution into an Executive pension plan for Mr. R Waxman.
Details of the Company pension contributions paid on behalf of Mr. R Pelham and Mr. P Edward are shown on page 6.
     
F e e s : The fees for non-executive directors are determined by the board. The non-executive directors are not involved in any discussions or decisions 
about their own remuneration.     
     
S e r v i c e 	 c o n t r a c t s : 	 	 	 	 	 	
Mr. A Edward, Mr. M Edward and Mr. R Waxman have rolling service agreements dated 1 April 2004 with notice periods of one year. There are no 
specific compensation provisions contained in these contracts, but termination by one party without the agreement of the other will give rise to a claim 
for damages. Mr. R Pelham has a rolling service agreement dated 1 April 2008 with a notice period of 6 Months. Mr. P Edward has a contract of 
Employment which provides for a 3 month notice period.     
     
Mr. I Edward and Mr. D Horne do not have service contracts. Mr. I Edward's letter of appointment was dated 1 April 1995 and Mr. D Horne's letter of 
appointment was dated 1 April 1993. Neither directors' letter contained fixed terms of service.     
     
Mr. D Horne and Mr. R Waxman are required to retire by rotation and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM.
