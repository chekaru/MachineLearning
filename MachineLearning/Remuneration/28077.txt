Directors' Remuneration Report Directors' Report
The Directors submit their report for 
the year ended 29 February 2004.
Principal activities and business review
The principal activities of the Group are
outdoor retailing and boardwear retailing
and wholesaling of clothing, footwear
and equipment.
A detailed review of the year's activities 
and future developments is given on 
pages 2 to 9.
Results and dividends
The Group profit for the year is shown 
on page 20.
The Directors recommend a final 
dividend of 5.4 pence per ordinary 
share (2003: 4.7 pence), which when
added to the interim dividend of 2.6
pence (2003: 2.4 pence), gives a total
dividend of 8.0 pence per ordinary 
share (2003: 7.1 pence). If approved 
at the Annual General Meeting, this will
be paid on 1 October 2004 to ordinary
shareholders on the register at the close
of business on 31 August 2004.
Donations
During the year the Group made
charitable donations totalling  10,710
(2003:  4,902). No political donations
were made (2003:  nil).
Directors
The names of the current Directors of the
Company and their biographical details
are given on page 10.
Directors' interests in transactions
There were no transactions in which 
any Director had a material interest.
Directors' responsibilities
The Companies Act 1985 requires the
Directors to prepare financial statements
for each financial year which give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Company and the Group and of the profit
or loss of the Group for that year.
In preparing those financial statements
the Directors are required to:
- select suitable accounting policies 
and apply them consistently;
- make judgements and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent;
- state whether applicable accounting
standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed
and explained in the financial statements;
- prepare financial statements on a going
concern basis unless it is inappropriate
to presume that the Company and the
Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping
proper accounting records which disclose
with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Group and to
enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies
Act 1985. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Group and
hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and
other irregularities.
Employment policies
The Directors endeavour to keep the
rewards for all Blacks Leisure Group
employees up to date and competitive 
in the market place.
Employee involvement
Group companies maintain close
consultation with their employees
regarding matters likely to affect their
interests and are committed to involving
them in the performance and
development of the Group.
It is the policy of the Group to support
the employment of disabled persons
wherever practicable and to ensure as 
far as possible that they participate in all
career opportunities available to staff.
Employee incentives
The Company has a Company Share
Ownership Plan, an Executive Share
Option Scheme and a Savings Related
Option Scheme. These schemes 
are intended to facilitate the greater
participation of employees in the future
financial success of the Group.
Payment policy
The Group seeks to ensure that terms 
of payment specified and agreed with
suppliers are not exceeded. Creditor 
days based on year end trade creditors
for 2004 were 48 days (2003: 45 days).
The Company does not have any trade
creditors and accordingly no creditor
days figure has been disclosed.
Auditors
On 31 December 2003, BDO Stoy Hayward,
the Company's auditors, transferred its
business to BDO Stoy Hayward LLP , a
limited liability partnership incorporated
under the Limited Liability Partnerships
Act 2000. Accordingly BDO Stoy Hayward
resigned as auditors on that date and the
Directors appointed BDO Stoy Hayward
LLP as its successor. A resolution to 
re-appoint BDO Stoy Hayward LLP as
auditors will be proposed at the next
Annual General Meeting.
