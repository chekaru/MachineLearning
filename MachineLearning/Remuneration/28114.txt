The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration
Committee is composed of C.M. Littner (Chairman), 
D.A. Bernstein and D.G.T rangmar . The Remuneration
Committee, on behalf of the Board, makes recommendations
regarding Executive Directors' remuneration packages
including bonuses, share options and other 
incentive schemes.
Directors' service contracts
Executive Directors For each Executive Director , their
service contract may be terminated by either party giving
twelve-months' notice.
Non-Executive Directors For each Non-Executive Director ,
their service contract is for two years and may be terminated
by either party giving six-months' notice.
Group policy on Executive Directors' remuneration The
objective of the Group's remuneration policy is to provide 
a level of remuneration which will attract, retain and motivate
Executive Directors and senior management of high quality.
Share options and longer-term incentives are used as part 
of the Group's remuneration policy. The amounts involved
and the frequency of issue endeavour to keep pace with
current market practice.
Variable rewards 
Executive Directors' bonus scheme Executive Directors
are entitled to performance related bonuses that are payable
based, in the main, upon the profit before interest and tax
improvement of the Group, or individual Group companies,
consistent with corporate financial targets as determined 
by the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration
Committee reviews performance against targets at the 
end of the year and may use its discretion to adjust
measures and payments in view of operating circumstances
during the year . Bonus payments are non-pensionable and
are subject to approval by the Committee.
The achievement of the highest performance targets would
entitle the Director to the maximum bonus payable of 100%
of basic salary.
Pension The Group made pension contributions of up 
to 20% of basic salary for the Executive Directors. These
contributions are paid into the equivalent of money purchase
pension schemes. No Directors are in the defined benefit
pension scheme.
Non-Executive Directors The remuneration of Non-
Executive Directors is set by the Executive Directors and
consists of fees for their services in connection with Board
and Committee meetings and other relevant matters.
Other matters The fees shown in respect of D.A. Bernstein
are paid to a third party.
