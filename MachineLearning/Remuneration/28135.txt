Group policy on Executive 
Directors' remuneration 
The objective of the Group's remuneration 
policy is to provide a level of remuneration 
which will attract, retain and motivate 
Executive Directors and senior 
management of high quality.  
 
Share options and longer term incentives 
are used as part of the Group's 
remuneration policy. The amounts 
involved and the frequency of issue 
endeavour to keep pace with current 
market practice.   
 
Share price performance  
The mid-market price on 28 February 
2009 was 42.0 pence. The lowest and 
highest prices during the year were 14.5 
pence and 177.5 pence.
The following graph shows the Company's performance, measured by total shareholder 
return, compared with the performance of the FTSE Small Cap   General Retailers over

Directors' Remuneration 
Report.
Variable Rewards   
Executive Directors' bonus scheme 
Executive Directors are entitled to 
performance related bonuses that are 
payable based, in the main, upon the 
profit before interest and tax improvement 
of the Group, or individual Group 
companies, consistent with corporate 
financial targets as determined by 
the Remuneration Committee. The 
Remuneration Committee reviews 
performance against targets at the end 
of the year and may use its discretion to 
adjust measures and payments in view of 
operating circumstances during the year. 
Bonus payments are non-pensionable 
and are subject to approval by the 
Committee.
The achievement of the highest 
performance targets would entitle the 
Director to the maximum bonus payable 
of 100% of basic salary.  
 
Pension     
The Group made pension contributions 
of up to 20% of basic salary for the 
Executive Directors. These contributions 
are paid into the equivalent of money 
purchase pension schemes.  
Non-Executive Directors   
The remuneration of Non-Executive 
Directors is set by the Executive Directors 
and consists of fees for their services in 
connection with Board and Committee 
meetings and other relevant matters. 
Other matters    
The fees shown in respect of D.A. 
Bernstein are paid to a third party.

Share Incentive Plan 
On 28 August 2008 a one-off 
performance related incentive award was 
granted to M.A. Lombardo as a part of 
the remuneration package made available 
on his appointment as Finance Director. 
The award was considered appropriate in 
order to attract his services in the role of 
Finance Director and to incentivise him to 
grow the business and its profitability so 
that the Company's share price rises over 
the next few years.    
   
The award is structured as a market value 
option over 300,000 ordinary shares in 
the Company, representing approximately 
0.7% of the issued share capital of the 
Company as at the date of grant of the 
option. The exercise price of the option is 
98.00p per ordinary share which reflects 
the market value of the shares at the date 
the option was granted. The option is 
24/25
exercisable over one third of the relevant 
shares on 20 November 2009, 
20 November 2010 and 20 November 
2011, provided the average closing 
share prices over any five consecutive 
dealing days falling after these 
anniversaries exceed 350p, 425p and 
500p respectively. If the first hurdle and/
or second hurdle are not achieved the 
relevant number of shares can be carried 
forward and the option exercised over 
those shares on later anniversaries, 
subject to the later hurdle being achieved
To the extent that the performance criteria 
are satisfied and the option is exercisable, 
the exercise of the option will be satisfied 
by the transfer of the relevant number 
of shares to M.A. Lombardo from the 
Company's Employee Benefit Trust. No 
new shares will be issued to satisfy this 
option. Instead shares are acquired in the 
market by the Employee Benefit Trust. 
The option is exercisable in full if there is 
a change of control of the Company after 
20 November 2008.  
 
In the event of any variation in the share 
capital of the Company (arising from any 
reduction of capital or sub-division or 
consolidation of capital or issue of shares 
by way of capitalisation of profits or 
reserves or by way of rights), the number 
of shares subject to the option may be 
adjusted in such manner as in the opinion 
of the Auditors of the Company is fair and 
reasonable.   
 
No benefit under the award is 
pensionable.
The Directors, who served during the year, had the following interests in the Share Incentive Plan at 28 February 2009:

Share options
Shares granted under the option schemes 
have been granted by the Remuneration 
Committee to attract, retain and motivate 
participants to achieve corporate financial 
targets.    
 
The value of share options granted during 
the year is up to 100% of basic salary and 
the value of shares that will vest is subject 
to the following performance criteria.  
     
 
In the 91 day period following 
20 November 2011, the Remuneration 
Committee shall determine the number 
of shares over which options may be 
exercised by undertaking the steps set 
out below:
   
1  If the average closing share price over 
any five consecutive dealing days in 
the 91 day period after 20 November 
2011 exceeds 500p then the option 
may be exercised over all of the 
shares over which it is granted.  
  
2  If the condition in paragraph 1 is not 
met, but the average share price over 
any five consecutive dealing days in 
the 91 day period after 20 November 
2010 exceeds 425p then the option 
may be exercised over two thirds of 
the shares over which it is granted.  
   
3   If the condition in paragraph 2 is not 
met, but the average share price over 
any five consecutive dealing days in 
the 91 day period after 20 November 
2009 exceeds 350p then the option 
may be exercised over one third of 
the shares over which it is granted.  
   
4  If the condition in paragraph 3 is not 
met then no part of the option may be 
exercised and the option shall lapse 
91 days after 20 November 2011.  
   
Directors' Remuneration 
Report.
The value of options granted annually, before 1 March 2008, is up to 66% of basic salary.
 
For options granted during the period of 1 March 2003 to 28 February 2008 the value of 
shares that will vest will be calculated as follows:
Extent to which the increase in Basic EPS exceeds the 
increase in RPI over the three-year period commencing 
1 March in the year of grant Vesting percentage
More than 3% compound per annum 75% 
More than 4% compound per annum 81% 
More than 5% compound per annum 88% 
More than 6% compound per annum 94% 
More than 7% compound per annum 100%
For options granted before 2003, 
performance conditions were selected 
to be in line with market practice at the 
date of grant. For options granted in 2001 
and 2002, over a period of three or four 
year continuous periods from a fixed start 
point of 1 March; and for 1999 and 2000 
grants over any three year continuous 
period after 1 March in the year of issue. 
Options granted before 2003 were 
exercisable if the Group's earnings per 
share increased by an average of at least 
3% per annum above the increase in RPI 
over their performance period.  
    
There were no Directors who served 
during the year that had any interests 
in share options, other than the Share 
Incentive Plan, at 28 February 2009. No 
Directors who served during the year 
exercised options during the year.
