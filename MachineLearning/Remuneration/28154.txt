Executive Directors and senior management of high quality.
Share options and longer term incentives are used as part of

frequency of issue endeavour to keep pace with current market 
practice and conditions.

The mid-market price of each Ordinary Share on 27 February 
2010 was 51.50 pence. The lowest and highest prices during the 
year were 26.75 pence and 61.75 pence respectively.

Variable rewards
Executive Directors' bonus scheme
Executive Directors are entitled to performance related bonuses 
that are payable based, in the main, upon the profit before 
interest and tax improvement of the Group, consistent with 
corporate financial targets as determined by the Remuneration 
Committee. The Remuneration Committee reviews performance 
against targets at the end of the year and may use its discretion 
to adjust measures and payments in view of operating 
circumstances during the year. Bonus payments are non-
pensionable and are subject to approval by the Committee.
The achievement of the highest performance targets would entitle 
the Director to the maximum bonus payable of 100% of basic 
salary. The Executive Directors received no bonuses from these 
arrangements in respect of this financial year.
Pension
The Group made pension contributions of up to 15% of basic 
salary for the Executive Directors. These contributions are paid 
into the equivalent of money purchase pension schemes.
Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is set by the 
Executive Directors and consists of fees for their services in 
connection with Board and Committee meetings and other 
relevant matters.
Other matters
The fees shown in respect of D.A. Bernstein are paid to a third 
party.

Turnaround Incentive Plan
On 24 November 2009, a new performance related incentive 
plan, the  Turnaround Incentive Plan' was approved at a General 
Meeting of Shareholders. This Scheme comprised a new share 
option scheme that was subject to performance conditions 
regarding profitability and share price, and accordingly aligned the 
interests of certain Directors and senior management with those 
of Shareholders. 
Options were granted on 18 January 2010 under the Turnaround 
Incentive Plan to certain Directors and other senior individuals 
within the Group. Any options already held by those individuals 
as part of other share incentive plans were surrendered and 
replaced with these new options. 
Share options granted under the Turnaround Incentive Plan 
are subject to market-related performance conditions based 
upon the profitability of the Group (defined as earnings before 
interest and tax,  EBIT') and the share price of Ordinary Shares. 
Profitability is measured cumulatively across the two complete 
financial years to 29 February 2012 and the share price is to 
be taken as the average closing price across July, August and 
September 2012. Both parameters contribute to determining the 
percentage of options that will vest, as set out below:
  
 
On the further condition that the individual continues to be 
employed (unless a  good leaver') by the Group on the vesting 
date of 18 January 2013, options will vest to the extent that 
performance criteria as above are satisfied. Vested options may 
then be exercised, at nil cost, from that date up to 18 January 
2020 and these options will be satisfied by the transfer of shares 
held by an Employee Benefit Trust. 
The options vest in full and are exercisable in full if there is a 
change of control of the Company which occurs at a price of 100 
pence or more per Ordinary Share. If such a change of control 
occurs at a price of less than 100 pence per share then the 
Remuneration Committee will determine whether and to what 
extent these awards will vest and become exercisable.
In the event of any variation in the share capital of the Company 
(arising from any reduction of capital or sub-division or 
consolidation of capital or issue of shares by way of capitalisation 
of profits or reserves or by way of rights), the number of shares 
subject to the options may be adjusted in such manner as the 
Remuneration Committee considers fair and reasonable so as 
not to disadvantage the participants under the plan as a result of 
such action.
No benefits under the scheme are pensionable.

All the above options were granted during the current financial year.
All options previously held under other share incentive schemes 
were surrendered on 18 January 2010 as part of the grant of 
the above options under the Turnaround Incentive Plan and, 
accordingly, no Directors who served during the year retain any 
interests in any other share option schemes as at 27 February 
2010. No share options, from any scheme, were exercised by 
Directors during the financial year.
Shares granted under option schemes are granted by the 
Remuneration Committee to attract, retain and motivate 
participants to achieve corporate financial targets. The value of 
share options granted during the year is up to 100% of basic 
salary and the value of shares that will vest is subject to the 
achievement of certain performance criteria as set out above.
No share options lapsed during the year, under any share 
incentive schemes, in respect of Directors who held office in the 
period.
