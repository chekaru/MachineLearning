Group policy on Executive Directors' remuneration
The objective of the Group's remuneration policy is to provide 
a level of remuneration which will attract, retain and motivate 
Executive Directors and senior management of high quality. 
Share options and longer term incentives are used as part of 
the Group's remuneration policy. The amounts involved and the 
frequency of issue endeavour to keep pace with current market 
practice and conditions.
 
In setting the Executive Directors' remuneration the Committee 
takes into account the pay and employment conditions applicable 
across the Group in the reported period. In common with the fact 
that there were no general pay increases for employees elsewhere 
in the Group, no increases were made in the period to Directors' 
remuneration terms since the prior year.  00 00 23

Variable Rewards 
Executive Directors' bonus scheme
Executive Directors are entitled to performance related bonuses 
that are payable based, in the main, upon the profit before interest 
and tax improvement of the Group, consistent with corporate 
financial targets as determined by the Remuneration Committee. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews performance against 
targets at the end of the year and may use its discretion to adjust 
measures and payments in view of operating circumstances 
during the year. Bonus payments are non-pensionable and are 
subject to approval by the Committee.
 
The achievement of the highest performance targets would entitle 
the Director to the maximum bonus payable of 100% of basic 
salary. The Executive Directors received no bonuses from these 
arrangements in either the current or the previous financial year.
Pension
The Group made pension contributions of up to 15% of basic 
salary for the Executive Directors. These contributions are paid 
into the equivalent of money purchase pension schemes.
Non-Executive Directors 
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is set by the 
Executive Directors and consists of fees for their services in 
connection with Board and Committee meetings and other 
relevant matters.
   
Other matters    
The fees shown in respect of D.A. Bernstein and T.W. Knight are 
paid to third parties.
Share price performance
The mid-market price of each Ordinary Share on 26 February 2011 was 22.40 pence. The lowest and highest prices during the year 
were 22.00 pence and 70.50 pence respectively. 
The following graph shows the Company's performance, measured by total Shareholder return, compared with the performance of the 
 FTSE Small Cap   General Retailers' index over the last five years: 
           
            
            
            
            
          
  
            
            
            
The Remuneration Committee has selected the above index as they consider it to be the most relevant for a company of Blacks' size 
and nature. This is consistent with prior years.

C.M. Littner and A.H. Mallett resigned from the Board on 14 July 2009.
N.M. Samuel died on 29 June 2010.         
T.W. Knight was appointed to the Board on 1 August 2010.
M.A. Hammersley was appointed to the Board on 20 September 2010.
  
Pension contributions were made in respect of two Directors (2010: two).
Turnaround Incentive Plan    
On 24 November 2009, during the prior financial year, a new 
performance related incentive plan, the  Turnaround Incentive 
Plan' was approved at a General Meeting of Shareholders. This 
Scheme comprised a new share option scheme that was subject 
to performance conditions regarding profitability and share price 
and accordingly aligned the interests of certain Directors and 
senior management with those of Shareholders. 
      
Options were granted on 18 January 2010 under the Turnaround 
Incentive Plan to certain Directors and other senior individuals 
within the Group. Any options already held by those individuals as 
part of other share incentive plans were surrendered and replaced 
with these new options. Further options under this Scheme were 
granted on 10 June 2010 to certain senior individuals within the 
Group, none of which were Directors of the Company.

Share options granted under the Turnaround Incentive Plan are subject to market-related performance conditions based upon the 
profitability of the Group (defined as earnings before interest and tax,  EBIT') and the share price of Ordinary Shares. Profitability is 
measured cumulatively across the two complete financial years to 3 March 2012 and the share price is to be taken as the average 
closing price across July, August and September 2012. Both parameters must be satisfied for any options to vest, as set out below:
        Ordinary Share % of award
Cumulative EBIT       price (each)  vesting
  10,000,000       60 pence 60%
  10,000,000       80 pence 80%
  10,000,000       100 pence 100%
  9,000,000       60 pence 40%
  9,000,000       80 pence 60%
  9,000,000       100 pence 80%
  8,000,000       60 pence 20%
  8,000,000       80 pence 40%
  8,000,000       100 pence 60%
  
On the further condition that the individual continues to be 
employed by the Group (unless a  good leaver') on the vesting 
date, on the third anniversary of the date of grant, options will 
vest to the extent that performance criteria as above are satisfied. 
Vested options may then be exercised, at nil cost, from that date 
up to the tenth anniversary of the date of grant and these options 
will be satisfied by the transfer of shares held by an Employee 
Benefit Trust. 
The options vest in full and are exercisable in full if there is a 
change of control of the Company which occurs at a price of 100 
pence or more per Ordinary Share. If such a change of control 
occurs at a price of less than 100 pence per share then the 
Remuneration Committee will determine whether and to what 
extent these awards will vest and become exercisable.
In the event of any variation in the share capital of the Company 
(arising from any reduction of capital or sub-division or 
consolidation of capital or issue of shares by way of capitalisation 
of profits or reserves or by way of rights), the number of shares 
subject to the options may be adjusted in such manner as the 
Remuneration Committee considers fair and reasonable so as not 
to disadvantage the participants under the plan as a result of such 
action. 
 
No benefits under the scheme are pensionable.
The Directors who served during the year had the following interests in the Turnaround Incentive Plan at 26 February 2011: 
        Dates Dates 
     Date of Maximum Price exercisable exercisable
     grant number exercisable from to
N.D. Gillis    18 Jan 2010 971,659 0.00p 18 Jan 2013 18 Jan 2020 
M.A. Lombardo    18 Jan 2010 550,607 0.00p 18 Jan 2013 18 Jan 2020
All the above options were granted during the prior financial year, 
on 18 January 2010. All options previously held under other share 
incentive schemes were surrendered as part of the grant of these 
options under the Turnaround Incentive Plan and, accordingly, no 
Directors retained any interests in any other share option schemes. 
No share options, from any scheme, were exercised by Directors 
during either the current or the prior financial year. 
   
Shares granted under option schemes are granted by the 
Remuneration Committee to attract, retain and motivate 
participants to achieve corporate financial targets. The value of 
share options granted during the year is up to 100% of basic salary 
and the value of shares that will vest is subject to the achievement 
of certain performance criteria as set out above. 
   
No share options lapsed during the year, under any share 
incentive schemes, in respect of Directors who held office in the 
period.
