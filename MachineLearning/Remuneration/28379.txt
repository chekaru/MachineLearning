 Remuneration Committee Report
Unaudited
This year the Remuneration Committee (or , for the purpose of this Section, the Committee ) 
reviewed the disclosure of blinkx remuneration arrangements and decided to improve transparency 
for our shareholders and further align our reporting with industry best practices.  In the coming 
year , we will continue to review our disclosure, and also initiate a dialogue with shareholders over 
remuneration as part of a wider review, which is currently in its initial stages.
The report that follows sets out both our pay policy and the actual pay delivered to the Directors of blinkx.
REMUNERATION   COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board 
on remuneration policy as applied to the Company's Executive Directors and most senior 
executives.  The Remuneration Committee currently consists of Judy Vezmar, who assumed 
the role of Committee Chair in February 2014, Anthony Bettencourt, Dr Michael Lynch and Ujjal 
Kohli.  The Chief Executive may, at the Committee's invitation, attend meetings except where his 
own remuneration is discussed.  The Committee met twice during the past financial year.  The 
Remuneration Committee's terms of reference are available on the Company's website.
In March 2014 the Committee appointed independent remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street 
(NBS ), to advise on all aspects of senior executive remuneration.  NBS has no other connection with 
the Company other than in the provision of advice on executive and employee remuneration.  In addition, 
the Company participates in the Global T echnology Survey conducted by Radford, a division of the AON 
Hewitt Company , to benchmark compensation structures across functions, levels and locations.
Pay philosophy
Historically, blinkx remuneration policy has been below market conditions.  This has included 
base pay that is below the level typically observed in companies of a comparable size and 
complexity but with an above market variable pay opportunity linked to delivering the 
Company's strategic objectives and generating returns for our shareholders.  This pay model was 
considered appropriate for a growth focused Company that seeks to attract, retain and motivate 
entrepreneurial executives of the appropriate caliber to deliver on the Company's strategy, but it 
has become increasingly difficult to attract and retain top talent.
Remuneration is purposefully weighted towards long-term performance to provide clear 
alignment with value creation for our shareholders.  Annual incentives are earned based on 
delivering against the Company's strategic objectives.  The balance between fixed and variable 
pay is set in light of the Company's risk appetite.  Over the course of the year, the Committee will 
continue to benchmark compensation structures to ensure that the Company can attract and 
retain top talent in an increasingly competitive industry.
Pay Policy for Executive Directors
Remuneration at the Company for Executive Directors is comprised of three elements: base salary, 
annual bonus, and long- term incentives with current policy being to grant market value share options 
and restricted stock units (RSUs).  This structure is transparent and well understood by participants.
40   |   FY2014 Annual Report |   41
A summary of each element of variable remuneration is set out below:
   The annual bonus is based on meeting or exceeding Company financial and operating 
performance and the achievement of individual objectives;
   The share options vest over a three to four year period.  Options are only of value to our 
Executive Directors if there has been an improvement in the Company's share price.  
However, due to tax consequences of vested options, most vested stock options are subject 
to sell to cover transactions to cover tax obligations that arise when vested options are 
exercised, thereby discouraging long-term holding of the shares;
   Restricted stock units (RSUs) that vest over a three year period and are currently awarded 
only to the Executive Directors.  RSUs are becoming an increasingly common form of 
compensation in the industry.  RSUs awards generally tend to be lower in quantum than 
Options awards, thereby reducing dilution for shareholders while encouraging longer 
term holding of the stock by employees upon vesting, thereby aligning management and 
shareholder interests.
Setting annual bonus targets based on Management By Objective (MBO) and operating 
performance is considered appropriate because it is fully aligned with the Company's key 
performance indicators of driving profitable revenue growth.  Generally this includes achievement 
of growth targets for revenue and profitability.
With regard to granting market value share options and RSUs, these are considered to be fully 
aligned with the Company's overall objective of creating shareholder value and the Company's 
current planning cycles of 3 to 4 years are aligned with the vesting profile of the market value 
options granted during the year under review.  Increasingly, the industry is moving away from 
options in favor of RSUs, and blinkx is likely to follow a similar path.
Pay Policy for Non-Executive Directors
Fees for Non-Executive Directors are set with reference to time commitment, the number of 
committees chaired and relevant external market benchmarks.  Current fees for Non-Executive 
Directors are  50,000 per annum.  Other than covering travel expenses, no additional fees 
or equity compensation is provided to Non-Executive Directors for ad hoc services, such as 
Committee memberships, board meetings, etc. Disclosure of Directors' Pay for the 2013/14 financial year
The total gain on exercise of share options by Executive Directors was $5,400,884 (2013: $13,362).  
None of the Directors had pension, retirement, or similar entitlement.  No payment or awards were 
made to former Directors during the year .
1.   No annual bonus is payable to Non-Executive Directors.  For Executive Directors, payments were 
determined based on the following performance conditions: individual Executive Director's 
MBOs and Company operating performance.
2.   Long-term incentive awards represent awards of share options and restricted stock units which 
vested during the year.  Long-term incentive value represents the notional gain.

on either side.  It is the Company's policy to mitigate costs on termination.  The current service 
contracts and letters of appointment of the Directors include the following terms:
Date of Contract Notice Period

Pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group
No element of remuneration is operated exclusively for Executive Directors and the philosophy of 
using variable remuneration to drive the Company's performance is applied to all roles throughout 
the Group.  All employees are eligible for an annual bonus and some senior roles are eligible to 
receive share options.  When setting the quantum of remuneration for Executive Directors, the 
Committee considers the pay differential between Executive Directors and other roles.
