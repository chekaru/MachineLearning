19. Share-based payments
The Company operates four equity-settled share-based payment arrangements, namely the two executive share option schemes, the 
performance share plan and the sharesave scheme. For the year ended  December  005 the Group recognised total expenses related 
to equity settled share based payment transactions since 7 November  00 of   6,000 ( 004,   5 ,000).
The 1994 Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Option Schemes ( the Schemes')
Under the rules of the Schemes the exercise price on the date of grant of options shall not be less than the higher of nominal value of an 
Ordinary Share and the average middle market quotation of an Ordinary Share for the three dealing days immediately preceding the 
offer of options under the Schemes. The vesting period is generally three years and is subject to the achievement of Earnings Per Share 
performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee. If an option remains unexercised after a period of ten years (Approved) or 
seven years (Unapproved) from the date of grant, the options will expire. Furthermore, except in certain circumstances, options lapse if 
the employee leaves the Group. No options have been granted under the Schemes since  004.

A period of six years was assumed for the expected life, being approximately the midpoint of the exercise window, and the average term 
as demonstrated in extensive exercise modelling conducted by New Bridge Street Consultants for their clients. The expected volatility 
was based on Bloomsbury's volatility over the period prior to grant equal in length to the expected 6 year life.

December  005 this commitment amounted to   ,57 ,000 ( 004,   , 46,000).
21. Post balance sheet events
The directors have proposed a final dividend of  .0 pence per share ( 004,  .478 pence per share), which will be paid on 6 July  006 to 
Ordinary Shareholders on the register at close of business on  6 May  006.  Based on the number of shares currently in issue, the final 
dividend will be   , 89,000 ( 004,   ,77 ,000). 
22. Significant non-cash transactions
 9,9 Ordinary Shares of  . 5p each were issued in January  005 as part of the deferred consideration in relation to the acquisition of 
Berlin Verlag in  00 .  The value of these shares at the date of issue was  66 ,000.
23. Financial instruments and risk summary
The Group has financed its operations from equity share issues and reinvestment of trading profits.  The Group has net cash funds.
The main risk arising from the Group's financial instruments is interest rate risk.  The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing risks, 
which are summarised below:
(i) Interest rate risk
As noted above, the Group has financed its operations through equity share issues and reinvestment of trading profits.  Surplus cash 
funds are invested on short-term deposit.  The directors continually review the Group's portfolio of short-term deposits to ensure that 
best rates of return are being achieved, based on the amount of deposited funds and the period for which they are invested, whilst 
minimising the risks involved by placing funds with reputable third-party banking organisations.  The terms under which the Group 
invests surplus cash funds permit immediate access to these funds if required.
The Group has financial assets of  5 ,5 ,000 at  December  005 ( 004,   9, 0,000) comprising cash and short-term deposits.  
The average rate of interest on cash deposits during the year ended  December  005 was 4.56% ( 004, 4.4 %).
The Group's financial liabilities at  December  005 and  December  004, all of which were at floating interest rates, were as follows:
      2005   004
       '000   '000
Guaranteed loan notes  005 - Sterling     -   8 Bank loan - US Dollars      -  6 Total      -  445
Details of the rates of interest payable on the Group's financial liabilities are shown in note  7.
All of the financial liabilities arose as a result of acquisitions and have now been repaid.  It is not part of the Group's general policy to fund 
its operations through such instruments.
(ii) Liquidity risk
The directors do not consider that the Group currently has a liquidity risk.
The Bloomsbury Performance Share Plan 2005 (the PSP Plan )
Under the rules of the PSP Plan, awards of fully paid Ordinary Shares are granted for nil consideration by the Remuneration Committee. 
For the purposes of determining the number of Ordinary Shares comprised in an award, the value of a share shall be equal to the 
average middle market price of the Ordinary Share for the five dealing days immediately preceding the award date. The vesting period  
is generally three years and the level of vesting is subject to the achievement of Earnings Per Share ( EPS') and Total Shareholder Return 
( TSR') performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee. Except in certain circumstances, awards lapse if the employee 
leaves the Group.
No awards were made under the PSP Plan prior to 4 November  005.

Risk Free Interest Rate     4.4% 4.4%
Fair Value charge per award       .4   .9 As vesting is on the third anniversary of grant, a three year expected life has been assumed. The expected volatility was based on 
Bloomsbury's volatility over the period prior to grant equal in length to the expected three year life. Half of any award is subject to an 
EPS performance condition (which is not factored into the valuation) and the other half is subject to a Total Shareholder Return 
condition whereby performance is compared to the FTSE Mid  50 companies (excluding Investment Trusts) over a three year period 
from the date of grant, with  5% of shares subject to this performance condition vesting for a median ranking rising to  00% for an 
upper quartile ranking. The discount for this TSR condition is calculated at the date of grant using the  Monte-Carlo' model.
Bloomsbury Sharesave Plan 2005
The Company operates an HM Revenue and Customs approved savings related share option scheme under which employees are 
granted options to purchase Ordinary Shares in the Company in three, five or seven years' time, dependent upon their entering into a 
contract to make monthly contributions to a savings account over the period of the savings term. Open to employees based in the UK, 
no shares were granted under this scheme during  005. A total of  5,67 options were granted on 5 May  006 at an exercise price of 
  .75 per share.
The Bloomsbury Employee Benefit Trust 2005 (the EBT )
Set up in  005, the EBT is a discretionary trust of which all employees of the Group are potential beneficiaries. The trustee is independent 
of the Company. Its main purpose is to operate with the Company's share schemes, in particular with the PSP Plan. While the trustee has 
power to subscribe for Ordinary Shares and acquire Ordinary Shares in the market or from treasury, it is not permitted to hold more than 
five per cent of the Company's issued share capital without prior approval of the shareholders. At  December  005 the trust held   00, 
representing the initial investment into the EBT.  
Bloomsbury Publishing Plc 68 69 This is the first year that the Company has presented its financial statements under IFRS.  The following disclosures are required in the 
year of transition.  The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended  December  004 and the date of transition 
to IFRS was therefore  January  004.
Full reconciliations of the results for the year ended  December  004 and the equity at this date and at  January  004 between UK 
GAAP and IFRS are set out on pages 7 and 74.  The main changes are explained below.
IFRS 3 - Business combinations
IFRS  requires that goodwill on acquisitions should be capitalised at cost and subject to impairment reviews at each reporting date.  
Amortisation of goodwill is not permitted.
Bloomsbury has taken advantage of the option to apply IFRS  prospectively from the date of transition to IFRS ( January  004), rather 
than restate earlier business combinations.  Goodwill has therefore been frozen at net book value at  January  004 and goodwill 
which was amortised in  004 under UK GAAP has been written back.
In respect of the acquisition of Walker Publishing Company, Inc. on  December  004, the goodwill arising on the acquisition has 
been reassessed and other identifiable intangible assets, included within goodwill under UK GAAP , have been separated out in 
accordance with the principles of IFRS  and IAS  8.  These intangible assets, which comprise only publishing relationships with a fair 
value of   54,000 at the date of acquisition, will be subject to systematic amortisation charges in accordance with IAS  8, with the 
unallocable balance, representing the goodwill on the acquisition, being subject to periodic impairment reviews. As the acquisition of 
Walker Publishing Company, Inc. took place on  December  004, no amortisation was charged in the UK GAAP accounts in  004 and 
there is therefore no effect on the reported profit for that year.
The effect on operating profit for the year ended  December  004 of the adoption of IFRS  is an increase of  675,000, representing 
the elimination of the goodwill amortisation charge.  There is no goodwill impairment charge for  004. As the amortisation charge  
in  004 was in respect of goodwill not eligible for tax relief, the writing back of the amortisation does not result in any change to the 
tax charge.
IFRS 2 - Share-based payment
The IFRS income statement includes a charge under IFRS  for employee share options granted after 7 November  00 . The fair value 
has been calculated using the Black-Scholes model with the resulting charge spread over the vesting period. The charge for the year 
ended  December  004 is   5 ,000 and the cumulative charge to that date is   7,000.
Corporation tax relief is given at the time that options are exercised on the difference between the exercise price and the market value 
of the shares at that date.  Consequently the share based payment charge gives rise to a temporary difference, in respect of which a 
deferred tax asset has been recognised.
IAS 19 - Employee benefits
Under UK GAAP , the Group had been making disclosures in its financial statements for a number of years under the transitional 
provisions of Financial Reporting Standard  7, but had not yet applied FRS  7 in full at  December  004.  IAS  9 is broadly similar to 
FRS  7, in that it requires surpluses or deficits on defined benefit pension schemes to be recognised on the balance sheet.
IAS  9 permits a number of options for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.  Bloomsbury has decided to recognise any 
variations in full in the income statement.  
The impact on the Group balance sheet at  December  004 is to recognise a gross pensions deficit of   0 ,000 and a related 
deferred tax asset of   ,000.  The profit before taxation for the year ended  December  004 is reduced by   0,000 and there is a 
deferred tax credit of  4,000 for the year.

Notes to the accounts
23. Financial instruments and risk summary (continued)
(iii) Currency risk
The Company believes, in its current circumstances, that hedging for exchange rate risk is not appropriate, as a significant proportion of 
revenues can be matched against expenditure in local currency.
Of the total monetary net assets of  55, 90,000 ( 004,  45,7 ,000),  9, 0,000 is denominated in US dollars ( 004,  7, 7 ,000) and 
  ,76 ,000 is denominated in euro ( 004,   ,7 ,000).  No material monetary net assets are denominated in currencies other than 
sterling, US dollars and euro.
(iv) Credit risk
The Group's credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.  The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of 
allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group's management based on the trading experience and the current 
economic environment.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-
rating agencies.  The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties 
and customers.
Fair value of financial instruments
There is no material difference between the fair value and book value of financial assets and liabilities.
24.  Related party transactions

Effect of the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards
on the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004
IAS 2 - The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates
Under UK GAAP , Bloomsbury chose to fix acquired overseas goodwill in sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the dates of the relevant 
acquisitions.  Under IAS  , goodwill must be denominated in local currencies and retranslated into sterling at each reporting date at 
closing exchange rates. The effect of this change is to increase the carrying value of goodwill in the Group balance sheet at  
December  004 by  4,000.
Under IAS  , translation differences in respect of the Company's investment in overseas subsidiary companies are included as a 
separate reserve within shareholders' equity.  In accordance with the exemption in paragraph  of IFRS  , the Company has deemed 
the opening balance on the translation reserve at  January  004 to be zero.
IAS 10 - Events after the balance sheet date
Under IAS  0 only dividends approved before the balance sheet date may be included in the financial statements as a liability.  As the 
final dividend for  004 was approved at the Annual General Meeting on  0 June  005, this has been removed from the financial 
statements at  December  004, increasing net assets by   ,77 ,000.
IAS 7 - Cash flow statements
The format of the cash flow statement is different under IAS 7 from its UK GAAP equivalent, FRS  . Cash flows are now shown under the 
three broad headings of Operating, Investing and Financing Activities and some cash flows have been reclassified as a result.
Conclusion
Adoption of IFRS has not had a significant effect on Bloomsbury's reported results and has had no effect on its cash flows for the year 
ended  December  004. There has also been no significant effect on shareholders' equity at that date.
