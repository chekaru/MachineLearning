The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 comprised	 at	 31	 December	 2006	 the	 three	 non-executive	 directors,	 Charles	 Black	 (its	 Chairman),	 Michael	 Mayer	 and	 Jeremy	 Wilson.	 Paul	 Scherer	 retired	 from	 the	 Board	 of	 the	 Company,	 and	 therefore	 from	 this	 Committee,	 on	 3	 April	 2006.
The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 operates	 under	 terms	 of	 reference	 agreed	 by	 the	 whole	 Board.
Remuneration Report
The	 Board	 has	 had	 full	 regard	 to	 the	 requirements	 set	 out	 in	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985	 Schedule	 7A	 (Directors'	 Remuneration	 Report	 Regulations	 2002)	 in	 preparing	 this	 report.	 A	 resolution	 will	 be	 put	 to	 the	 shareholders	 at	 the	 Annual	 General	 Meeting	 to	 be	 held	 on	 28	 June	 2007	 inviting	 them	 to	 consider	 and	 approve	 this	 report.
Compliance
The	 constitution	 and	 operation	 of	 the	 Committee	 is	 in	 compliance	 with	 the	 principles	 and	 best	 practice	 provisions	 as	 set	 out	 in	 the	 Combined	 Code,	 and	 full	 consideration	 was	 given	 to	 these	 in	 determining	 the	 remuneration	 packages	 for	 the	 executive	 directors	 for	 2006	 and	 2007.
From	 information	 available	 on	 the	 public	 record	 at	 Companies	 House	 in	 published	 Remuneration	 Reports,	 the	 Committee	 was	 able	 to	 assess	 during	 2005	 that	 the	 remuneration	 levels	 of	 the	 executive	 directors	 were	 at	 a	 level	 comparable	 to	 other	 media	 companies	 of	 a	 similar	 size	 and	 commensurate	 with	 their	 duties	 and	 responsibilities.	 In	 2006	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 took	 economic	 and	 business	 forecasts	 into	 consideration	 in	 determining	 the	 executive	 directors'	 remuneration	 levels
Policy on Remuneration of Executive Directors
The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 reviews	 the	 performance	 of	 executive	 directors	 and	 sets	 the	 scale	 and	 structure	 of	 their	 remuneration	 and	 the	 basis	 of	 their	 service	 agreements	 with	 due	 regard	 to	 the	 interests	 of	 shareholders.	 In	 determining	 that	 remuneration,	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 seeks	 to	 offer	 a	 competitive	 remuneration	 structure	 to	 maintain	 the	 high	 calibre	 of	 the	 Company's	 executive	 board.	 The	 Committee	 believes	 that	 maintaining	 the	 Group's	 business	 growth	 and	 profit	 record	 requires	 an	 overall	 compensation	 policy	 with	 a	 strong	 performance-related	 element.
The	 main	 components	 of	 the	 executive	 directors'	 remuneration	 are:
1) Basic salary
Basic	 salary	 for	 each	 director	 is	 determined	 by	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 taking	 into	 account	 external	 market	 data.	 The	 Committee's	 policy	 is	 to	 review	 salaries	 annually.
2) Annual bonus
The	 Company	 operates	 an	 annual	 bonus	 scheme	 for	 its	 executive	 directors	 based	 on	 a	 combination	 of	 performance	 and	 profit	 related	 targets.	 For	 Nigel	 Newton	 and	 Colin	 Adams	 the	 amount	 payable	 is	 determined	 by	 reference	 to	 a	 combination	 of	 the	 final	 level	 of	 pre-tax	 profit	 achieved	 in	 the	 year	 against	 the	 budgeted	 pre-tax	 profit	 (the	 Profit	 Related	 Element )	 and	 performance	 targets	 for	 the	 Group's	 US	 and	 German	 businesses.	 For	 Liz	 Calder	 the	 amount	 payable	 is	 determined	 by	 reference	 to	 a	 combination	 of	 the	 Profit	 Related	 Element	 and	 performance	 targets	 for	 her	 publishing	 list.
For	 2006	 the	 bonus	 for	 each	 of	 the	 directors,	 which	 is	 not	 pensionable,	 was	 limited	 to	 100%	 of	 basic	 salary	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 financial	 	 year.	 No	 bonuses	 were	 paid	 to	 the	 directors	 in	 respect	 of	 2006.
3) Pension contributions
The	 Group	 does	 not	 operate	 a	 pension	 scheme,	 but	 Nigel	 Newton	 and	 Colin	 Adams	 each	 receive	 a	 contribution	 of	 10%	 of	 their	 basic	 salary	 to	 their	 private	 pension	 scheme	 and	 Liz	 Calder	 receives	 a	 contribution	 of	 18%	 of	 her	 basic	 salary	 to	 her	 private	 pension	 scheme.

4) Share options, the Performance Share Plan and Sharesave Plan
The	 Group	 believes	 that	 share	 ownership	 by	 executive	 directors	 strengthens	 the	 link	 between	 their	 personal	 interests	 and	 those	 of	 the	 shareholders	 in	 respect	 of	 shareholder	 value.	 Upon	 listing	 of	 the	 Company	 in	 1994,	 Approved	 and	 Unapproved	 Executive	 Share	 Option	 Schemes	 (the	 Schemes )	 were	 introduced.
At	 the	 time	 options	 were	 granted	 under	 the	 Approved	 and	 Unapproved	 Executive	 Share	 Option	 Schemes,	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 considered	 that	 the	 performance	 measure	 chosen	 for	 the	 Schemes,	 namely	 growth	 in	 earnings	 per	 share	 (EPS),	 was	 the	 key	 long-term	 indicator	 of	 the	 Group's	 financial	 success.	 Approved	 options	 are	 only	 exercisable	 on	 the	 condition	 that	 the	 growth	 in	 the	 Company's	 earnings	 per	 share	 shall	 equal	 or	 exceed	 the	 increase	 in	 the	 Index	 of	 Retail	 Prices	 (All	 Items)	 from	 the	 date	 of	 grant	 of	 the	 option	 to	 the	 date	 of	 exercise	 of	 the	 option.	 Unapproved	 options	 granted	 on	 or	 before	 2	 June	 2000	 had	 the	 same	 exercise	 pre-
condition	 as	 for	 Approved	 options,	 however	 Unapproved	 options	 granted	 after	 this	 date	 are	 only	 exercisable	 on	 the	 condition	 that	 the	 growth	 in	 the	 Company's	 EPS	 shall	 exceed	 the	 increase	 in	 the	 Index	 of	 Retail	 Prices	 (All	 Items)	 by	 15.7625	 percent	 (representing	 five	 per	 cent	 compound	 annually)	 for	 the	 three	 financial	 years	 immediately	 preceding	 the	 date	 of	 exercise	 of	 the	 option.	 The	 10	 year	 life	 of	 the	 Schemes	 has	 now	 expired	 and	 no	 new	 options	 have	 been	 granted	 under	 either	 of	 the	 Schemes	 since	 2004.	 During	 2004	 and	 2005	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 consulted	 with	 advisors	 and	 major	 shareholders	 to	 develop	 new	 	 long-term	 incentive	 plans.	 The	 Committee	 was	 keen	 to	 ensure	 that	 any	 replacement	 schemes	 were	 designed	 to	 help	 achieve	 	 the	 following	 objectives:
   they are market competitive in terms of quantum and exercisability;
   they are subject to performance conditions that the Remuneration Committee considers to be demanding; 
   they provide an appropriate link between reward and performance;
   they have a less dilutive effect on the issued share capital of the Company than share option schemes; and
   broad employee participation is achieved through an incentive arrangement that is available to as many employees as possible.
At	 an	 Extraordinary	 General	 Meeting	 of	 the	 Company	 held	 on	 27	 September	 2005	 resolutions	 were	 passed	 approving	 the	 setting	 up	 of	 a	 Performance	 Share	 Plan	 (to	 incentivise	 the	 executive	 directors	 and	 other	 senior	 employees),	 a	 Sharesave	 Plan	 (to	 incentivise	 the	 Bloomsbury	 workforce	 as	 a	 whole)	 and	 an	 Employee	 Benefit	 Trust	 (to	 operate	 in	 conjunction	 with	 the	 new	 plans,	 as	 appropriate	 -	 further	 detail	 on	 the	 Employee	 Benefit	 Trust	 is	 set	 out	 on	 page	 80).
Performance Share Plan (the PSP )
The	 plan	 allows	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 to	 grant	 conditional	 allocations	 of	 Ordinary	 Shares	 to	 eligible	 employees	 with	 a	 maximum	 value	 (normally)	 of	 150%	 of	 base	 salary	 per	 annum.	 Awards	 granted	 under	 the	 PSP	 will	 normally	 only	 vest	 after	 three	 years	 provided	 the	 participant	 is	 still	 employed	 in	 the	 Group	 and	 that	 performance	 conditions	 have	 first	 been	 achieved	 (these	 conditions	 are	 set	 by	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 each	 year	 prior	 to	 award).	 The	 first	 awards	 under	 the	 PSP	 were	 made	 on	 4	 November	 2005,	 since	 when	 there	 have	 been	 further	 awards	 on	 26	 October	 2006	 and	 8	 May	 2007.	 Details	 of	 the	 awards	 to	 directors	 and	 the	 conditions	 attaching	 to	 those	 awards	 are	 set	 out	 on	 page	 32.
The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 has	 no	 present	 intention	 of	 granting	 awards	 greater	 than	 100%	 of	 base	 salary	 per	 annum,	 but	 is	 conscious	 that	 it	 may	 be	 appropriate	 to	 apply	 even	 more	 demanding	 performance	 conditions	 if	 it	 is	 felt	 appropriate	 to	 make	 awards	 under	 the	 PSP	 in	 excess	 of	 100%	 of	 salary	 in	 any	 year.
Sharesave Plan
This	 is	 an	 all-employee	 savings-related	 share	 option	 scheme	 under	 which	 options	 can	 be	 granted	 to	 acquire	 Ordinary	 Shares	 after	 a	 vesting	 period	 of	 three,	 five	 or	 seven	 years	 at	 an	 exercise	 price	 determined	 at	 the	 outset,	 on	 condition	 that	 they	 agree	 to	 make	 savings	 into	 a	 special	 savings	 account.	 This	 plan	 is	 approved	 by	 HM	 Revenue	 and	 Customs	 and	 gives	 participants	 tax	 and	 national	 insurance	 benefits.	 The	 first	 grant	 of	 115,671	 options	 under	 this	 plan	 was	 made	 on	 5	 May	 2006.	 A	 second	 invitation	 to	 participate	 in	 the	 Sharesave	 Scheme	 was	 issued	 to	 eligible	 staff	 on	 9	 May	 2007,	 with	 grants	 of	 options	 expected	 to	 be	 made	 at	 the	 beginning	 of	 June	 2007. Bloomsbury	Publishing	Plc	 29
Contracts of Service
All	 the	 executive	 directors	 have	 service	 contracts	 which	 are	 terminable	 by	 either	 party	 giving	 to	 the	 other	 not	 less	 than	 twelve	 months'	 written	 notice.	 Nigel	 Newton's	 contract,	 dated	 24	 June	 2003,	 had	 an	 initial	 fixed	 term	 of	 three	 years.	 Under	 the	 terms	 of	 the	 contract,	 on	 24	 June	 2005	 this	 agreement	 effectively	 became	 and	 continues	 to	 be	 terminable	 by	 either	 party	 giving	 to	 the	 other	 not	 less	 than	 twelve	 months'	 written	 notice	 as	 recommended	 by	 the	 Combined	 Code.	 Colin	 Adams's	 contract	 is	 dated	 24	 September	 2004	 and	 Liz	 Calder's	 contract	 is	 dated	 1	 July	 2004.
The	 non-executive	 directors,	 Charles	 Black,	 Michael	 Mayer,	 and	 Jeremy	 Wilson	 do	 not	 have	 service	 contracts	 but	 each	 has	 a	 letter	 of	 appointment.	 Each	 letter	 of	 appointment	 is	 dated	 7	 July	 2006,	 and	 all	 confirm	 that	 the	 term	 of	 appointment	 is	 until	 the	 2007	 Annual	 General	 Meeting	 when	 it	 is	 envisaged	 that	 the	 letters	 of	 appointment	 will	 be	 renewed	 for	 a	 further	 period	 of	 twelve	 months.	 Paul	 Scherer,	 who	 retired	 from	 the	 Board	 on	 3	 April	 2006,	 had	 a	 letter	 of	 appointment	 dated	 22	 July	 2005.
There	 are	 no	 specific	 provisions	 for	 compensation	 on	 early	 termination	 of	 service	 contracts.	 Compensation	 on	 early	 termination	 may	 be	 payable	 by	 the	 Company	 by	 agreement	 between	 the	 Company	 and	 the	 director	 and	 with	 the	 approval	 of	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee.
No	 compensation	 for	 loss	 of	 office	 was	 paid	 to	 Paul	 Scherer	 following	 his	 retirement	 from	 the	 Board.

(2)	 For	 the	 purposes	 of	 determining	 the	 number	 of	 Ordinary	 Shares	 comprised	 in	 an	 award	 the	 market	 value	 of	 a	 share	 shall	 be	 equal	 to	 the	 average	 middle-market	 price	 of	 a	 share	 during	 the	 five	 dealing	 days	 immediately	 preceding	 the	 award	 date.	 For	 the	 2005	 awards	 under	 the	 PSP	 the	 average	 price	 was	 337.9p	 per	 share	 and	 the	 closing	 middle	 market	 price	 on	 the	 date	 of	 award	 was	 342p.	 For	 the	 2006	 awards	 under	 the	 PSP	 the	 average	 price	 was	 315.25p	 and	 the	 closing	 middle	 market	 price	 on	 the	 date	 of	 award	 was	 312p.		 For	 the	 2007	 award	 under	 the	 PSP	 the	 average	 price	 was	 181.4p	 and	 the	 closing	 middle	 market	 price	 on	 the	 date	 of	 award	 was	 185.25p.

(4)	 For	 all	 awards	 made	 to	 the	 directors,	 there	 are	 two	 performance	 conditions	 which	 need	 to	 be	 satisfied	 if	 awards	 are	 to	 vest	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 three	 year	 performance	 period	 (the	 Performance	 Period ):
(a) In	 respect	 of	 50%	 of	 the	 total	 award,	 the	 performance	 condition	 is	 growth	 in	 Bloomsbury's	 normalised	 Earnings	 Per	 Share	 (EPS)	 over	 the	 Retail	 Prices	 Index	 (RPI)	 during	 the	 three	 full	 financial	 years	 immediately	 preceding	 the	 end	 of	 the	 relevant	 Performance	 Period.	 If	 EPS	 growth	 is	 between	 5%	 and	 8%	 p.a.	 over	 RPI,	 the	 number	 of	 shares	 vesting	 will	 be	 pro	 rata	 to	 actual	 growth,	 with	 17.5%	 of	 total	 award	 vesting	 at	 5%	 p.a.,	 and	 the	 full	 50%	 vesting	 at	 8%	 p.a.	 None	 of	 this	 part	 of	 the	 award	 will	 vest	 if	 EPS	 growth	 over	 RPI	 is	 less	 than	 5%	 p.a.
(b) In	 respect	 of	 50%	 of	 the	 total	 award,	 the	 performance	 condition	 is	 Bloomsbury's	 rank	 over	 the	 relevant	 Performance	 Period	 in	 terms	 of	 its	 Total	 Shareholder	 Return	 (TSR)	 compared	 to	 companies	 constituting	 the	 FTSE	 Mid	 250	 (excluding	 investment	 trusts)	 at	 the	 date	 of	 grant.	 If	 the	 Company's	 TSR	 ranking	 is	 between	 median	 and	 the	 upper	 quartile,	 the	 number	 of	 shares	 vesting	 will	 be	 pro	 rata	 to	 position,	 with	 17.5%	 of	 total	 award	 vesting	 at	 median,	 and	 the	 full	 50%	 vesting	 if	 the	 Company's	 position	 is	 in	 the	 upper	 quartile.	 None	 of	 this	 part	 of	 the	 award	 will	 vest	 if	 the	 Company's	 TSR	 ranking	 is	 below	 median.
