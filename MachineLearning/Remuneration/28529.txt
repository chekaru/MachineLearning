 The Remuneration Committee comprised at 31 December 2008 the three non-executive directors, Charles Black (its Chairman),
Michael Mayer and Jeremy Wilson. 
The Remuneration Committee operates under Terms of Reference agreed by the whole Board.
Remuneration Report
The Board has had full regard to the requirements set out in the Companies Act 1985 Schedule 7A (Directors' Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002) in preparing this report. A resolution will be put to the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting
to be held on 29 May 2009 inviting them to consider and approve this report.
Compliance
The constitution and operation of the Committee is in compliance with the principles and best practice provisions as set out 
in the Combined Code, and full consideration was given to these in determining the remuneration packages for the executive
directors for 2008 and 2009.
Policy on Remuneration of Executive Directors
The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance of executive directors and sets the scale and structure of their
remuneration and the basis of their service agreements with due regard to the interests of shareholders. In determining that
remuneration, the Remuneration Committee seeks to offer a competitive remuneration structure to maintain the high calibre
of the Company's executive board. The Committee believes that maintaining the Group's business growth and profit record
requires an overall compensation policy with a strong performance-related element.
The main components of the executive directors' remuneration are:
1) Basic salary
Basic salary for each director is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account external market data. 
The Committee's policy is to review salaries annually.
2) Annual bonus
The Company operates an annual bonus scheme for its executive directors. For 2008 Nigel Newton and Colin Adams the
amount payable was determined by reference to achieving budgeted operating profit targets. For Richard Charkin the amount
payable was determined by reference to a combination of Group EPS and budgeted operating profit. 
For 2008 the bonus for each of the aforementioned directors, which is not pensionable, was limited to a maximum of 100%
of basic salary at the end of the financial year. Liz Calder, who retired on 1 April 2008, did not participate in the annual bonus
scheme in 2008. 
The 2009 bonuses for Nigel Newton, Richard Charkin and Colin Adams will remain a maximum of 100% of basic salary. 
80% of their bonus will be based on a range of pre tax profit targets set by reference to the Group budget and 20% 
will be based on the successful delivery of pre-set strategic and personal goals. 
All annual bonuses are payable in cash following the release of the Group's preliminary audited results.
3) Pension contributions
The Group does not operate a pension scheme, but the executive directors receive a contribution to their private pension
arrangements. These contribution levels have been reviewed by the Committee during the year. With effect from 1 January
2009 Nigel Newton and Colin Adams will each receive a contribution of 15% of their basic salary to their private pension
schemes, and Richard Charkin will receive an additional contribution of 5% of his basic salary in lieu of pension.
4) Share options, the Performance Share Plan and Sharesave Plan
The Group believes that share ownership by executive directors strengthens the link between their personal interests and
those of the shareholders in respect of shareholder value. Upon listing of the Company in 1994, Approved and Unapproved
Executive Share Option Schemes (the Schemes ) were introduced. The 10 year life of the Schemes has now expired and 
no new options have been granted under either of the Schemes since 2004.

Remuneration Report
80971 PRE 2:80971 Bloomsbury Pre 2  21/4/09  18:26  Page 40 At an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company held on 27 September 2005 resolutions were passed approving the
setting up of a Performance Share Plan (to incentivise the executive directors and other senior employees), a Sharesave Plan
(to incentivise the Bloomsbury workforce as a whole) and an Employee Benefit Trust (to operate in conjunction with the new
plans, as appropriate) - further detail on the Employee Benefit Trust is set out on page 91. 
Performance Share Plan (the PSP )
The plan allows the Remuneration Committee to grant conditional allocations of Ordinary Shares to eligible employees with 
a maximum value (normally) of 150% of base salary per annum. Awards granted under the PSP will normally only vest after
three years, provided the participant is still employed in the Group and that performance conditions have first been achieved
(these conditions are set by the Remuneration Committee each year prior to award). The first awards under the PSP were
made on 4 November 2005, since when there have been further awards on 26 October 2006, 8 May 2007 and 12 May 2008
to directors and the conditions attached to those awards are set out on page 44.
The Remuneration Committee has not granted and has no present intention of granting awards greater than 100% of base
salary per annum, save for an initial grant to Richard Charkin on joining the Company of 150% of base salary which was
awarded during 2008. The Remuneration Committee is conscious that it may be appropriate to apply even more demanding
performance conditions if it is felt appropriate to make awards under the PSP in excess of 100% of salary in any year.
Sharesave Plan
This is an all-employee savings-related share option scheme under which options can be granted to acquire Ordinary Shares
after a vesting period of three, five or seven years at an exercise price determined at the outset, on condition that they agree
to make savings into a special savings account. This plan is approved by HM Revenue and Customs and gives participants tax
and National Insurance benefits. The first grant of 115,671 options under this plan was made on 5 May 2006, a second grant
of 100,118 options on 8 June 2007 and a third grant of 92,983 was made on 12 May 2008. 
Contracts of Service
All the executive directors have service contracts which are terminable by either party giving to the other not less than twelve
months' written notice. 
Nigel Newton's contract, dated 24 June 2003, had an initial fixed term of two years. Under the terms of the contract, on 
24 June 2005 this agreement effectively became and continues to be determinable by either party giving to the other not 
less than twelve months' written notice as recommended by the Combined Code. 
Colin Adams' and Richard Charkin's contracts are dated 24 September 2004 and 10 October 2007 respectively. Liz Calder's
contract was dated 1 July 2004 and ended on 1 April 2008.
The non-executive directors, Charles Black and Michael Mayer, do not have service contracts, but each has a letter of
appointment. Each letter of appointment is dated 7 July 2006, and all confirmed that the term of appointment was until the
2007 Annual General Meeting and thereafter subject to re-election every three years in accordance with the Company's
Articles of Association. The Chairman Jeremy Wilson's letter of appointment is dated 31 October 2007 and is determinable 
by either party giving three months' notice and is subject to re-election every three years. 
There are no specific provisions for compensation on early termination of service contracts. Compensation on early
termination may be payable by the Company by agreement between the Company and the director and with the approval 
of the Remuneration Committee. No compensation was paid to Liz Calder when she retired on 1 April 2008.
Policy on Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is set by the executive directors. The non-executive directors do not participate
in the Company's pension, annual bonus or equity plans and their fees are paid entirely in cash compensating them for their
time and responsibilities.

(1) For the purposes of determining the number of Ordinary Shares comprised in an award the market value of a share shall be equal to either the average
middle-market price of a Share during the five dealing days immediately preceding the award date or the middle-market price on the dealing day before the award
date. The 2005 awards under the PSP were based on the average middle-market price of 337 .9p. The 2006 awards under the PSP were based on the average
middle-market price of 315.25p. The 2007 award under the PSP were based on the average middle-market price of 181.4p. The 2008 award under the PSP were
based on the middle market price of 144.5p.
(2) All awards are granted for nil consideration and are in respect of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc Ordinary Shares of 1.25p.
(3) For all awards made to the directors, there are two performance conditions which need to be satisfied if awards are to vest at the end of the three year
performance period (the Performance Period ):
a. In respect of 50% of the total award, the performance condition is growth in Bloomsbury's normalised Earnings Per Share (EPS) over the Retail Prices Index
(RPI) during the three full financial years immediately preceding the end of the relevant Performance Period. If EPS growth is between 5% and 8% p.a. over
RPI, the number of shares vesting will be pro rata to actual growth, with 17 .5% of total award vesting at 5% p.a., and the full 50% vesting at 8% p.a. None 
of this part of the award will vest if EPS growth over RPI is less than 5% p.a.
b. In respect of 50% of the total award, the performance condition is Bloomsbury's rank over the relevant Performance Period in terms of its Total Shareholder
Return (TSR) compared to companies constituting the FTSE Mid 250 (excluding investment trusts) at the date of grant. If the Company's TSR ranking is
between median and the upper quartile, the number of shares vesting will be pro rata to position, with 17 .5% of total award vesting at median, and the full
50% vesting if the Company's position is in the upper quartile. None of this part of the award will vest if the Company's TSR ranking is below median.
(4) There will be no opportunity to retest performance if the performance conditions are not satisfied over the relevant Performance Period.
Directors' Interests 
a) Interests in shares
The directors who held office during the year had the following interests in the share capital of the Company.
