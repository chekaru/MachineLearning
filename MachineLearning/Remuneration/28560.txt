Remuneration Report
Remuneration Report
The Remuneration Committee comprised at 31 December 2009 the 
three Non-Executive Directors, Charles Black (its Chairman), Michael 
Mayer and Jeremy Wilson.
The Remuneration Committee operates under Terms of Reference 
agreed by the whole Board.
Remuneration Report
The Board has had full regard to the requirements set out in the 
Companies Act 2006 s420 and SI 2008 no. 410 sch8 in preparing this 
report. A resolution will be put to the shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting to be held on 28 May 2010 inviting them to consider 
and approve this report.
Compliance
The constitution and operation of the Committee is in compliance 
with the principles and best practice provisions as set out in the 
Combined Code, and full consideration was given to these in 
determining the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors 
for 2009 and 2010.
Policy on Remuneration of Executive Directors
The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance of Executive 
Directors and sets the scale and structure of their remuneration and 
the basis of their service agreements with due regard to the interests 
of shareholders. In determining that remuneration, the 
Remuneration Committee seeks to offer a competitive remuneration 
structure to maintain the high calibre of the Company's Executive 
Board. The Committee believes that maintaining the Group's 
business growth and profit record requires an overall compensation 
policy with a strong performance-related element, linked to the 
Company's business objectives.
The main components of the Executive Directors' remuneration are:
1) Basic salary
Basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the 
Remuneration Committee taking into account external market data. 
The Committee's policy is to review salaries annually. For 2010 only, 
the Directors have agreed to a voluntary cut in their base salaries 
of 10%.
2) Annual bonus
The Company operates an annual bonus scheme for its Executive 
Directors. For 2009 the bonus for Nigel Newton, Colin Adams and 
Richard Charkin, which is not pensionable, was limited to a maximum 
of 100% of basic salary at the end of the financial year. 80% of their 
bonus was based on a range of operating profit targets set by 
reference to the Group budget and 20% was based on the successful 
delivery of pre-set strategic and personal goals.
The 2010 bonuses for Nigel Newton, Richard Charkin and Colin 
Adams will remain a maximum of 100% of basic salary. 80% of their 
bonus will be based on a range of pre-tax profit targets set by 
reference to the Group budget and 20% will be based on the 
successful delivery of pre-set strategic and personal goals.
All annual bonuses are payable in cash.
3) Pension contributions
The Executive Directors receive a contribution to their private 
pension arrangements. Nigel Newton and Colin Adams each receive 
a contribution of 15% of their basic salary to their private pension 
schemes, and Richard Charkin receives an additional contribution of 
5% of his basic salary in lieu of pension.
4) Share options, the Performance Share Plan 
and Sharesave Plan
The Group believes that share ownership by Executive Directors 
strengthens the link between their personal interests and those of 
the shareholders in respect of shareholder value. Upon listing of the 
Company in 1994, Approved and Unapproved Executive Share 
Option Schemes ( the Schemes') were introduced. The ten year life 
of the Schemes has now expired and no new options have been 
granted under either of the Schemes since 2004.
At an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company held on 
27 September 2005 resolutions were passed approving the setting up 
of a Performance Share Plan (to incentivise the Executive Directors and 
other senior employees), a Sharesave Plan (to incentivise the 
Bloomsbury workforce as a whole) and an Employee Benefit Trust (to 
operate in conjunction with the new plans, as appropriate) - further 
detail on the Employee Benefit Trust is set out on page 84.
Performance Share Plan (the PSP ) - The plan allows the 
Remuneration Committee to grant conditional allocations of 
Ordinary Shares to eligible employees with a maximum value 
(normally) of 150% of base salary per annum. Awards granted 
under the PSP will normally only vest after three years, provided the 
participant is still employed in the Group and that performance 
conditions have first been achieved (these conditions are set by the 
Remuneration Committee each year prior to award). The first awards 
under the PSP were made on 4 November 2005, since when there 
have been further awards on 26 October 2006, 8 May 2007, 12 May 
2008 and 25 September 2009 to Directors (and other eligible 
employees) and the conditions attached to those awards are set out 
on pages 81 and 82.
The Remuneration Committee has not granted and has no present 
intention of granting awards greater than 100% of base salary per 
annum, save for an initial grant to Richard Charkin on joining the 
Company of 150% of base salary which was awarded during 2008.  Bloomsbury Publishing Plc

The Remuneration Committee is conscious that it may be 
appropriate to apply even more demanding performance 
conditions if it is felt appropriate to make awards under the PSP in 
excess of 100% of salary in any year.
Sharesave Plan - This is an all-employee savings-related share option 
scheme under which options can be granted to acquire Ordinary 
Shares after a vesting period of three, five or seven years at an exercise 
price determined at the outset, on condition that they agree to make 
savings into a special savings account. This plan is approved by HM 
Revenue & Customs and gives participants tax and National Insurance 
benefits. The first grant of 115,671 options under this plan was made 
on 5 May 2006, a second grant of 100,118 options on 8 June 2007 and a 
third grant of 92,983 was made on 12 May 2008.
Contracts of Service
All the Executive Directors have service contracts which are 
terminable by either party giving to the other not less than twelve 
months' written notice.
Nigel Newton's contract, dated 24 June 2003, had an initial fixed 
term of two years. Under the terms of the contract, on 24 June 2005 
this agreement effectively became and continues to be 
determinable by either party giving to the other not less than twelve 
months' written notice as recommended by the Combined Code.
Colin Adams' and Richard Charkin's contracts are dated 
24 September 2004 and 10 October 2007 respectively.
The Non-Executive Directors, Charles Black and Michael Mayer, 
do not have service contracts, but each has a letter of appointment. 
Each letter of appointment is dated 7 July 2006, and both 
confirmed that the term of appointment was until the 2007 
Annual General Meeting and thereafter subject to re-election  
every three years in accordance with the Company's Articles 
of Association. The Chairman Jeremy Wilson's letter of appointment 
is dated 31 October 2007 and is determinable by either party 
giving three months' notice and is subject to re-election every 
three years.
There are no specific provisions for compensation on early 
termination of service contracts. Compensation on early termination 
may be payable by the Company by agreement between the 
Company and the Director and with the approval of the 
Remuneration Committee.
Policy on Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is set by the 
Executive Directors. The Non-Executive Directors do not participate 
in the Company's pension, annual bonus or equity plans and their 
fees are paid entirely in cash compensating them for their time and 
responsibilities.

  For the purposes of determining the number of Ordinary Shares comprised in an award the market value of a share shall be equal to either the average 
middle-market price of a share during the five dealing days immediately preceding the award date or the middle-market price on the dealing day before 
the award date. The 2006 awards under the PSP were based on the average middle-market price of 315.25p. The 2007 award under the PSP were based on 
the average middle-market price of 181.4p. The 2008 awards under the PSP were based on the middle-market price of 144.5p. The 2009 awards under the PSP 
were based on the middle market price of 120.5p.
(2) 
All awards are granted for nil consideration and are in respect of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc Ordinary Shares of 1.25p.
(3)
   For awards made to the Directors from 2005 to 2008, there are two performance conditions which need to be satisfied if awards are to vest at the end of the 
three year performance period (the  Performance Period'):
 a.  In respect of 50% of the total award, the performance condition is growth in Bloomsbury's normalised Earnings Per Share (EPS) over the Retail Prices 
Index (RPI) during the three full financial years immediately preceding the end of the relevant Performance Period. If EPS growth is between 5% and 
8% p.a. over RPI, the number of shares vesting will be pro rata to actual growth, with 17.5% of total award vesting at 5% p.a., and the full 50% vesting at 
8% p.a. None of this part of the award will vest if EPS growth over RPI is less than 5% p.a.
 b.  In respect of 50% of the total award, the performance condition is Bloomsbury's rank over the relevant Performance Period in terms of its Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) compared to companies constituting the FTSE Mid 250 (excluding investment trusts) at the date of grant. If the Company's 
TSR ranking is between median and the upper quartile, the number of shares vesting will be pro rata to position, with 17.5% of total award vesting at 
median, and the full 50% vesting if the Company's position is in the upper quartile. None of this part of the award will vest if the Company's TSR ranking 
is below median.
(4)
   For awards made to Directors in 2009, there are two performance conditions which need to be satisfied if awards are to vest at the end of the three year 
performance period (the  Performance Period'):
 a.  In respect of 50% of the total award, 33% vests if the normalised Earnings Per Share (EPS) is 8.25p, 66% vests if the EPS is 8.75p and 100% vests if the EPS is 
9.25p. Between 8.25p, 8.75p and 9.25p vesting will be 33%, 66% and 100%, respectively, pro rata on a straight-line basis. None of this part of the award 
will vest if the EPS is less than 8.25p.
 b.  In respect of 50% of the total award, the performance condition is Bloomsbury's rank over the relevant Performance Period in terms of its Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) compared to companies constituting the FTSE Mid 250 (excluding investment trusts) at the date of grant. If the Company's 
TSR is median ranking the number of shares vesting will be 35% and if the Company's TSR is at the upper quartile ranking the number of shares vesting 
will be 100%. Between median and upper quartile vesting will be 35% and 100%, respectively, pro rata on a straight-line basis. None of this part of the 
award will vest if the Company's TSR ranking is below median.
(5)
  For all awards, there will be no opportunity to retest performance if the performance conditions are not satisfied over the relevant Performance Period.
