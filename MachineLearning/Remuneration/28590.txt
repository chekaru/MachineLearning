Directors' Remuneration Report
Corporate Governance Directors' Remuneration Report
Introduction
This report has been prepared on behalf of the Board by 
the Remuneration Committee in accordance with Schedule 
8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies 
Act 2006. The report also meets the relevant requirements 
of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and 
describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to 
Directors' remuneration in The Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance revised June 2008 (the Code ). As required by 
the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed 
at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the 
financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company's 
members on certain parts of the Directors' Remuneration 
Report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of 
the report have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Accounting Regulations. The report has therefore been 
divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited 
information.
PART A   UNAUDITED INFORMATION 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises three independent 
non-executive directors, namely Sarah Jane Thomson 
(Chairman of the Committee), Ian Cormack (Senior 
Independent Director) and Jeremy Wilson (Chairman of 
the Board). The Committee has been chaired by Sarah Jane 
Thomson from 25 May 2010 prior to which the Committee was 
chaired by Charles Black.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest 
(other than as shareholders), conflicts of interests arising from 
cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running 
the business. The Committee makes recommendations to the 
Board. No Director plays a part in any discussion about his or 
her own remuneration.
When considered appropriate, advice has been taken from 
external consultants New Bridge Street. The Committee's 
terms of reference are available on the Company's website 
www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk and from the Company Secretary 
on request.
Remuneration Policy
The remuneration policy aims to encourage the highest levels 
of performance, to attract, motivate and retain high calibre 
directors and to align the interests of the executive directors 
with those of the shareholders. Remuneration is structured so 
that a significant element is related to performance, both short 
term and long term.
The components of the Executive Directors' remuneration are:
1) Basic salary
The salaries for the Executive Directors are as follows:
Executive Director
14 months to 
28 February
 2011
 '000
12 months to 
31 December
 2010
 '000
12 months to 
31 December
 2009
 '000
Nigel Newton 404 341 378
Richard Charkin 329 279 308
Colin Adams 223 193 214
Basic salaries are reviewed annually and are set at levels 
that take account of the performance, experience and 
responsibilities of each individual concerned having regard to 
the prevailing market conditions and the overall pay rise used 
for employees generally when determining the Group budget. 
On appointment, the basic salaries for executive directors 
take account of appropriate market competitive ranges from 
companies of a similar size and complexity.
In respect of the year to 31 December 2010, the directors 
voluntarily elected to waive an annual increase and took 
a cut in basic salary of 10%. This followed consideration of 
the pressures faced by Bloomsbury's employees from the 
challenging economic environment.
The level of opportunity to earn performance related annual 
bonus and to earn long term incentive awards is a set as a 
proportion, determined by the Committee, of basic salary. The 
Committee has regard to the basic salary of the director when 
determining the level of pension payments for those directors 
who receive pension contributions.

Directors' Remuneration Report
2) Pension contributions
On his appointment, the basic salary of Richard Charkin 
included an allowance in lieu of pension and no further 
pension contributions have been made. Nigel Newton and 
Colin Adams each receive contributions to their contributory 
private pensions approved annually by the Committee 
taking account of their basic salary, director remuneration in 
businesses of similar size and complexity, their performance 
and applicable tax regulation.
The Committee intends to review the structure of director 
remuneration, including the policy with respect to pensions, 
with external specialists to ensure that directors are motivated 
to achieve the highest levels of performance aligned with the 
interests of the shareholders.
3) Other benefits
The Company offers executive directors a motor vehicle 
or a cash alternative and benefits including life assurance, 
permanent health cover, private medical cover and other 
minor benefits.
4) Performance related annual bonus
The executive directors are eligible for an annual cash bonus up 
to a maximum of 100% of basic salary as per the previous year.
Annual bonuses for the period are determined by reference 
to both financial performance and personal and strategic 
objectives. The financial objectives, which accounted for 
80% of the bonus awards for the period, require suitably 
stretching levels of Group profit before tax during the year. 
The financial objectives set by the Committee were achieved 
in full. The personal and strategic targets, which account for 
the remaining bonus award, are set to incentivise the delivery 
of key strategic and development objectives over the year in 
relation to each executive Directors' area of responsibility. 
In respect of the 14 month period to 28 February 2011, the 
Committee approved annual bonuses for executive directors 
that are restricted to 12 months as follows:
Bonus
 '000
% basic 
salary
Percent
Nigel Newton 341 100%
Richard Charkin 265 95%
Colin Adams 193 100%
 
Basic salary for the 12 months to 31 December 2010 is used in 
the table above to calculate the % basic salary.
5) Long term incentive plans
Performance Share Plan (PSP )
The PSP permits performance shares to be granted annually 
to executive directors and senior individuals up to a maximum 
level of 150% of base salary per annum. In practice, the 
Committee applies a maximum award level of 75% of basic 
salary for the Chief Executive, 66% for the other executive 
directors and lower levels for individuals below the level of the 
Board. The Committee intends to make an initial PSP award of 
100% of basic salary for Wendy Pallot.
The PSP was approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting held on 27 September 2005 and enables the Company 
to set suitably challenging targets to reward outstanding 
performance over a three year performance period.
Generally, awards of PSP Performance Shares are granted 
subject to two non-concurrent performance conditions, 
namely 50% of awards are subject to normalised Earnings Per 
Share (EPS ) targets and 50% of awards are subject to Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR ) targets over a three year period. 
PSP awards lapse in the event that the conditions are not met 
at the end of the three year performance period.
EPS performance conditions and level of vesting
The Committee determines performance conditions for each 
award at the time of making each award and determines 
the basis for calculating normalised EPS. The normalised 
EPS performance conditions applied over a three year 
performance period for PSP awards granted prior to 2009 
have been:
Criteria for normalised EPS Level of vesting 
Less than RPI +5% per year Nil
RPI +5% per year 35%
RPI +8 % per year and above 100%
Vesting between RPI +5% and RPI +8% is straight line.
In respect of annual PSP awards granted on 25 September 
2009 and 6 May 2010 the Committee approved absolute 
normalised EPS performance targets for the three year 
performance period. This took account of consensus broker 
forecasts and the need to set challenging performance targets 
to motivate the highest levels of performance of the executive 
directors in light of deteriorating economic conditions 
prevailing at the time of making the awards.

pence and 9.25 pence is straight line.
TSR performance conditions and level of vesting
The TSR performance conditions applied to PSP awards over 
a three year performance period are generally as follows. The 
comparator group is the FTSE Mid 250 excluding investment 
trusts or as otherwise determined by the Committee.

Details of the directors' outstanding PSP awards and awards 
made during the 14 month period ended 28 February 2011 are 
shown below in Part B of this report.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme (Sharesave )
All UK employees, including the executive directors, are eligible 
to participate in the Company's all employee HM Revenue and 
Customs approved Sharesave scheme. The Sharesave allows 
participants to make 36 equal monthly instalments under a 
building society savings contract. On maturity of the savings 
contract, participants may use the savings plus interest to 
purchase shares under share options granted at a discount of 
15% to the market price at the start of the savings contract.
Details of the directors' outstanding Sharesave options are 
shown in Part B of this report. 
Change of control provisions for share schemes
On a change of control, PSP awards vest to the extent that 
the performance conditions, as adjusted for the reduced 
vesting period due to the change of control, have been 
achieved subject to settlement of taxes arising on vesting. The 
Committee would determine a reasonable basis for measuring 
the extent to which the performance conditions have been 
achieved. Sharesave options become exercisable on a change 
of control however the treatment for tax would be subject to 
HM Revenue & Customs regulations that apply at the time.
Shareholding guidelines
The Company does not have a policy requiring the executive 
directors to hold a minimum value of the Company's shares.
Total value of incentives for Executive Directors
The charts below summarise the key drivers of performance 
and their influence on the overall incentive package for 
the executive directors. In order to illustrate the impact of 
different levels of performance on the composition of total 
remuneration in terms of the proportion of fixed and variable 
remuneration, two notional levels of company share price, 
company and personal performance have been defined. The 
assumptions made for the charts are as follows:
Performance level

The chart is based on the face values of incentive awards at 
threshold and stretch performance levels (as defined above), 
however actual values of awards that vest under the schemes 
will depend on future share prices at the time the awards vest.

The charts above exclude pensions and the value of Sharesave 
scheme options in which executive directors may voluntarily 
participate. Pension contributions are approved annually by 
the Committee, and vary by executive director. One executive 
director does not receive a pension contribution. The Committee 
intends to review the policy on pensions. The Chief Executive is 
assumed to receive annual LTIP PSP awards at the level of 75% of 
basic salary and other executive directors are assumed to receive 
annual awards at a level of 66% of basic salary.
Remuneration earned by the Executive 
Directors from outside appointments
Significant external appointments of the directors are given in 
the bibliographic details on page 23. The Committee considers 
that the external appointments of the executive directors have 
no detrimental impact on the performance of their duties. 
The Committee has approved that each executive director 
may retain his or her remuneration earned from external 
appointments up to  15,000 per year.
Contracts of Service
The Company's policy is for executive directors to have contracts 
of employment with notice periods of up to 12 months. The 
Company will not enter into service contracts of more than two 
years duration without obtaining prior shareholder approval. 
Contracts with notice periods in excess of 12 months will only be 
considered at the time of recruitment and would normally be 
structured so that the notice period reduces to a period up to 12 
months over a specified time of service.
Details of the service contracts of the directors at the date of 
signing this report are set out below:
Executive 
Directors
Date

Date

period
Nigel Newton 24 June 2003 - 12 months
Richard Charkin 10 October 2007 - 12 months
Wendy Pallot 10 March 2011 - 12 months*
*  The service agreement of Wendy Pallot includes that notice 
is three months during the first three months of service 
following which the notice period increases to 12 months.
The service agreements of Richard Charkin and Wendy Pallot 
include terms such that there would be no claim for loss of 
office as a director of the Company resulting from termination 
of their service agreement. The agreement for Wendy Pallot 
includes that the Company may make a payment of basic 
salary in lieu of notice. There are no further specific provisions 
for compensation on early termination of service contracts for 
the executive directors and no automatic right to payments. 
In the event of early termination, the Committee would seek 
to take such steps as necessary to mitigate the loss to the 
Company and to ensure that the executive director observed 
his or her duty to mitigate loss. The Committee considers the 
termination terms of the executive directors to be appropriate 
to avoid rewarding failure on termination.

Non-Executive Directors
The fees of non-executive directors are determined by the Chairman and the executive directors. The fees of the Chairman are determined 
by the Remuneration Committee. The fees and continuance of service of each non-executive director are reviewed at least annually. Non-
executive directors receive a basic fee plus an extra fee for additional responsibilities such as chairing sub-committees. The basic fee and extra 
fee is reviewed annually taking account of benchmark data provided by external remuneration consultants New Bridge Street.
The Non-Executive Directors and Chairman do not participate in the Company's annual bonus or share incentive schemes 
including Sharesave.

There are no specific provisions for compensation on early termination of service contracts for the Non-Executive Directors. In 
the event of early termination, the Board would seek to take such steps as necessary to mitigate the loss to the Company and to 
ensure that the director observed his or her duty to mitigate loss.
