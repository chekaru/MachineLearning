DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
T
his Directors' Remuneration Report has 
been prepared on behalf of the Board by the 
Remuneration Committee (the Committee ) 
and has been approved by the Bloomsbury 
Board. As required by the Companies Act 2006 (the Act ), 
a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the 
2012 Annual General Meeting.
The Committee has adopted the principles of good 
governance relating to Directors' remuneration as set out 
in the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code ). The 
report complies with the Act and the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority. The Company has complied 
with the provisions of the Code relating to Directors' 
remuneration throughout the year.
The Act requires the external auditor to state whether, 
in their opinion, certain parts of this report have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the applicable 
regulations. Part A below, which is not subject to audit, sets 
out the Company's remuneration policy. Part B, which has 
been audited, provides details of the remuneration and 
share incentives of the Directors.
PART A - UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration committee
Membership
Throughout the year ended 29 February 2012 and up until 
signing this report the Committee has comprised three 
independent non-executive directors, namely Sarah Jane 
Thomson, Ian Cormack and Jeremy Wilson. Sarah Jane 
Thomson has chaired the Committee since 28 May 2010. 
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
Assistance to the Committee
During the year the Committee took advice from external 
remuneration consultants, principally New Bridge Street, 
who do not perform other services for the Company. 
The Committee received assistance from the Company 
Secretary and, where specifically requested by the 
Committee, the Chief Executive and Finance Director. 
Meetings were held with major shareholders during the 
year as part of Bloomsbury's ongoing investor relations 
programme to discuss corporate governance matters 
including remuneration. The conclusions of these meetings 
have been discussed by the Committee. The Committee 
also considers the reports and recommendations of 
shareholder representative bodies and corporate 
governance analysts.
Terms of Reference
During the year the Committee reviewed its terms of 
reference as part of the Board evaluation process and 
recommended to the Board that these should be updated 
in line with model terms of reference published by the 
Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators.  
The Committee's terms of reference are available  
on the Company's investor relations website  
www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk.
Responsibilities and activities of the Committee
The Committee determines the remuneration policy for the 
executive directors for approval by the Board. In particular, 
the Committee approves for each executive director the 
basic salaries, pensions, other benefits, bonus awards and 
the awards made under Bloomsbury's Long Term Incentive 
Plan (see below). The Committee approves all payments of 
bonus for each executive director and the vesting of all LTIP 
awards before payments are made.
The Committee considers it is appropriate for the executive 
directors to determine the remuneration of senior 
management. In respect of employees below the level of 
the Board, the Committee approves the bonus pool from 
which bonuses are paid and approves the grant/vesting of 
all LTIP awards before payments are made.
The Committee met formally on five occasions during 
the year including two occasions without the executive 
directors present and on three occasions with the executive 
directors attending part of meetings for specific items on 
agendas at the invitation of the Committee. During the 
year the Committee:
   approved a below-inflation annual increase in 
basic salaries for executive directors of 2.8% being 
the budgeted increase for the basic salaries of all 
Bloomsbury employees;
   implemented performance targets for the annual 
bonus that proved to be stretching and which brought 
about vital short and long term changes to the business. 
Based on the results for the year ended 29 February 
2012, the Committee has approved bonus payments 
for executive directors of 54% of salary (see below for 
further details). The level of bonus payments approved 
by the Committee has been substantially reduced 
compared to the previous period whilst Adjusted Profit 
(see below for details of the treatment of highlighted 
items) and Profit Before Tax have increased and key 
initiatives have been implemented; 58
GOVERNANCE
Bloomsbury Publishing Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
   implemented new procedures for setting performance 
targets for LTIP that ensure stretching performance is 
required for vesting to start and that the highest levels 
of performance are required for full vesting. Applying 
these procedures the Committee approved the 
granting of LTIP awards for the year;
   determined that LTIP awards granted in 2008 should not 
vest; and
   reviewed the structure of executive director 
remuneration and concluded that the:
   annual cash bonus, subject to minor refinements 
to make the scheme more stretching and more 
focussed on achieving vital strategic objectives, 
remains appropriate, providing a strong incentive 
to motivate the Directors and align their short-term 
interests with those of the shareholders; and
   the structure of the existing LTIP remains 
appropriate, providing a strong incentive to attract, 
retain and motivate the Directors to achieve the 
highest levels of performance and align their long-
term interests with those of the shareholders.
Remuneration policy
In determining remuneration policy the Committee applies 
the key principles that remuneration:
   should attract and retain suitably high calibre executive 
directors and ensure that they are motivated to achieve 
the highest levels of performance including delivering 
strategic initiatives and objectives; and 
   should align the interests of the executive directors with 
those of the shareholders. 
A significant proportion of the remuneration of each 
executive director is expected to accrue through 
variable elements (see below) which are dependent 
on the performance of the business and the personal 
performance of the Director both over the course of 
the year and over the longer term. Remuneration of the 
executive directors is reviewed annually. 
In order to illustrate the impact of different levels of 
performance on the composition of total remuneration 
in terms of the proportion of fixed (salary, pension and 
benefits) and variable (annual bonuses and long term 
incentives) remuneration, two notional levels of Company 
share price, Company and personal performance have 
been defined. The assumptions made for the charts are as 
follows:

LTIP 50% of the value

The charts below assume that future LTIP is awarded at a 
level of 75% of basic salary for Nigel Newton and 66% of 
basic salary for Richard Charkin and Wendy Pallot until 
such time as the Committee changes policy. The charts 
exclude the relatively minor value of options granted 
under Bloomsbury's Sharesave scheme in which executive 
directors may voluntarily participate.

GOVERNANCE
The fixed and variable components of the executive 
directors' remuneration are as follows.
1) Basic salary
Basic salaries for the executive directors are reviewed 
annually and are set at levels that take account of the 
performance, experience and responsibilities of each 
individual concerned having regard to the prevailing 
market conditions and the budgeted annual increase in 
basic salaries used for Bloomsbury employees generally. On 
appointment, the basic salaries for executive directors take 
account of appropriate market competitive ranges from 
companies of a similar size and complexity. The Committee 
determines as a proportion of basic salary, the level of 
opportunity to earn a performance related annual bonus 
and the level of opportunity to earn long term incentive 
awards.
The salaries for the executive directors are as follows:

*  For the 12 months from 1 January 2010, Nigel Newton and Richard Charkin 
voluntarily took a 10% reduction in basic salary which was restored effective 
from 1 January 2011.
   Or date of appointment if later in the period
   Wendy Pallot was appointed on 8 April 2011 on an initial salary of  220,000
2) Pension contributions
Executive directors may receive contributions from the 
Company to their contributory pensions schemes based 
on a percentage, determined by the Committee, of 
their basic salary. On his appointment, the basic salary of 
Richard Charkin included an allowance in lieu of pension 
at a level of 10% of basic salary excluding pension. No 
further pension contributions have been made by the 
Company. During the year ended 29 February 2012 the 
other executive directors received contributions to their 
contributory private pensions which ranged from 10% to 
15% of basic salary. Further details are presented within the 
Directors' Emoluments table.
3) Other benefits
The Company offers executive directors a car or a 
cash alternative and benefits including life assurance, 
permanent health cover, private medical cover and other 
minor benefits. Wendy Pallot receives a cash alternative 
of  10,000 to a car allowance. On his appointment in 2007, 
Richard Charkin received an uplift in basic salary of  10,000 
in lieu of a car allowance.
4) Performance related annual bonus
The Committee determines the policy on an annual cash 
bonus scheme for the executive directors and the eligibility 
of executive directors to participate in the scheme.
For the year ended 29 February 2012 the Committee 
reviewed the annual cash bonus to ensure that it strongly 
aligns the short term interests of executive directors with 
those of the shareholders. The conclusion of this review 
was that subject to minor refinements, the majority of the 
annual cash bonus provides the executive directors with 
a strong incentive for the highest levels of performance 
over the coming financial year. The Committee refined the 
bonus scheme to ensure that:
   basic profit related bonus and personal/strategic 
objectives bonus (see below) require stretching 
Adjusted Profit performance in order for any bonus 
to begin to accrue and requires exceptional Adjusted 
Profit performance to be achieved in order for full 
bonus to be earned; and
   there is an increased emphasis on each executive 
director achieving strategic objectives that realise 
benefits to the Group both in the present and future 
years. 
Following the introduction of the new scheme, annual 
cash bonus payments to the executive directors for the 
year ended 29 February 2012 have fallen compared to the 
previous period both in absolute terms and as a proportion 
of basic salary whilst Adjusted Profit and Profit Before Tax 
have both increased. Further, the executive directors have 
also achieved a wider range of strategic objectives vital to 
the business.
As a percentage of basic salary, the opportunity for the 
executive directors to earn bonus is as follows:
Period end:
29 February 
2012
28 February
2011*
Profit Related bonus 70% 80%
Personal Objectives bonus 10% 10%
Strategic Objectives bonus 20% 10%
Maximum bonus 
opportunity 100% 100%
 
*  Bonus in respect of the 14 months ended 28 February 2011 was restricted to  
12 months. 60

BUSINESS REVIEW OVERVIEW FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COMPANY INFORMATION
GOVERNANCE
Operation of the bonus pool
Bonuses paid to the executive directors and other 
managers in the business are paid from a bonus pool 
approved by the Committee. The bonus pool is calculated 
by applying formulae based on Adjusted Profit and targets 
set by the Committee. If there is a short fall in the bonus 
pool such that the pool is not sufficient to fund full bonuses 
then the bonuses for the executive directors and other 
managers are scaled back in proportion to the shortfall. 
The Committee sets a minimum target for Adjusted Profit 
below which no bonuses are paid. The minimum target 
is in line with City analysts' key indices, namely Adjusted 
Profit, prevailing at the time bonus plans are set by the 
Committee.
Profit measurement for annual cash bonus
Consistent with other UK listed companies in the media 
sector, the Committee considers that audited Adjusted 
Profit to be an appropriate financial measure for the 
performance targets for profit related bonus. This measure 
of performance is consistent with the profit forecasts 
that City analysts publish and ensures that the majority 
of the annual cash bonus and the short term financial 
achievement of the executive directors are aligned with the 
interests of the shareholders.
The Committee may use its independent discretion to 
adjust bonus payments in order to ensure they are aligned 
with the interests of shareholders. The Committee considers 
each highlighted item that is excluded from Adjusted Profit 
and determines whether, in the opinion of the Committee, 
the treatment with respect to bonus is in the interests of 
shareholders.
Highlighted items for the financial year
Adjusted Profit, on which profit related bonus is calculated, 
is before highlighted items. The Committee considered in 
detail the highlighted items set out in the Chief Executive's 
review on pages 5 to 15. The Committee sets bonus targets 
before amortisation of intangible assets consistent with the 
accounting treatment for Adjusted Profit and City analysts' 
key indices and is satisfied that the amortisation charge for 
the year is not exceptional. In determining whether other 
highlighted items may be excluded from Adjusted Profit for 
the purposes of calculating the bonus the Committee has 
applied the following criteria:
 
   the highlighted items relate to important strategic 
steps instructed by the Board that have been taken to 
strengthen the business;
   future profits should benefit from the investment value 
of the highlighted items;
   failure to implement the strategic steps and incur the 
highlighted items would have been detrimental to the 
interests of the shareholders;
   management has mitigated the quantum of the 
highlighted items; and
   the highlighted items are measureable, properly 
accounted for and audited.
The Committee also takes account of whether highlighted 
items have arisen as a result of the executive directors 
achieving their personal and strategic bonus objectives 
approved by the Committee. 62

Bloomsbury Publishing Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Highlighted item  m Commentary
Recurring amortisation of intangible 
assets.
1.6 To be consistent with Adjusted Profit, City analysts' indices and 
market practice in the listed media sector, bonus targets are 
calculated before the annually recurring charge for the amortisation 
of intangibles. The level of the charge is not exceptional for the year 
given the recent acquisition of Continuum International Publishing 
Group Limited. The Remuneration Committee is comfortable that this 
approach remains appropriate and, by measuring and rewarding 
performance which is directly influenced by the executive directors, 
is aligned to shareholder interests.
Restructuring costs relating to the 
strategic global reorganisation of 
the Group including restructuring 
following the acquisition of 
Continuum International Publishing 
Group Limited.
1.3 Business operations have been transformed by the successful 
implementation of One Global Bloomsbury - the consolidation 
of the Group's various acquisitions, fragmented local publishing 
activities and local support functions into four worldwide unified 
publishing divisions supported by global production, sales and 
marketing, finance and other support functions. This strategic move 
was deemed critical to the Company's future brought about by the 
digital revolution and its global impact.
One Global Bloomsbury has opened up the Group's intellectual 
property assets to the sales and marketing function and extended 
the global reach of the function. This will help drive future revenue 
growth as the business develops its digital content assets.
Costs for establishing and relocating 
the Group's head office to bring 
together many acquisitions.
0.4 In line with One global Bloomsbury, the consolidation of most of the 
UK employees into a single head office building will yield efficiencies 
and productivity improvements. It will help the business to grow 
whilst enabling better control of operating costs thus protecting 
margins.
Bringing talented multi-disciplinary teams and people into close 
proximity will help the business develop new ideas into products 
more efficiently. 
Acquisition costs. 0.3 During the year the Board approved the acquisition of significant lists 
of titles and the acquisition of Continuum International Publishing 
Group Limited aligned with Bloomsbury's long term group strategy 
of an increased focus on academic publishing to capitalise on 
the robust nature of these income streams. Investing in these 
acquisitions is needed to develop the business and should increase 
future profits.
Disposal of Bloomsbury Verlag, 
Bloomsbury's former German 
subsidiary.
1.0 During the year the Board reviewed its international footprint 
strategy to ensure investment and time was being allocated to the 
areas of greatest growth potential and least risk. The conclusion of 
this review has been the disposal of the German subsidiary whilst 
retaining the opportunity to partner with the acquirer and the 
development of a wholly owned start up in India.

  Total bonus includes bonus paid to the executive directors and to managers below the level of executive director. 
5) Long term incentive plans
The Company's primary long term incentive plan (LTIP) is the Bloomsbury Publishing Plc 2005 Performance Share Plan 
which was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 27 September 2005. LTIP awards are made by 
the Committee to the executive directors and managers below board level.
Details of the Directors' outstanding LTIP awards are shown in Part B of this report.
Level of LTIP awards 
The policy of the Committee is to apply a maximum award level of 75% of basic salary for the Chief Executive, 66% for the 
other executive directors and lower levels for individuals below the level of the Board. The Committee may use its discretion to 
approve a one-time enhanced award to an executive director upon their appointment to the Board: Wendy Pallot who was 
appointed to the Board on 8 April 2011 has been made an initial award of 100% of basic salary. The terms of the LTIP permit 
awards to be granted to executive directors and senior individuals up to a maximum level of 150% of base salary per annum.
The level of LTIP awards granted to the executive directors as a percentage of basic salaries are as follows:
Year of award 2011 2010 2009
Nigel Newton 75% 75% 75%
Richard Charkin 66% 66% 66%
Wendy Pallot 100% - -
Colin Adams - 66% 66% 64
GOVERNANCE
Bloomsbury Publishing Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Performance conditions for LTIP awards
LTIP awards are subject to two non-concurrent performance conditions, namely 50% of the awards are subject to 
Normalised Earnings Per Share (EPS ) targets and 50% of the awards are subject to Total Shareholder Return (TSR ) 
targets at the end of a three year period. LTIP awards lapse in the event that the conditions are not met at the end of the 
three year performance period.
The Committee has reviewed the LTIP and concluded that non-concurrent rather than concurrent EPS and TSR 
performance conditions provide the most effective incentive to align the long-term interests of LTIP participants with the 
long-term interests of the shareholders.
The Committee determines performance conditions for each LTIP award at the time of making an award.
EPS targets
In respect of the 2011 LTIP awards, the following approach was taken for setting the EPS performance targets:
   The Lower Vesting threshold (see below) for Normalised EPS was set with reference to City analysts' indices for Adjusted 
EPS prevailing at the time the awards were granted.
   The Mid Vesting threshold was determined so as to align the expected value of the awards with the expected value of 
similar awards granted by other listed companies to executive directors. The expected value of 2011 LTIP awards was 
estimated from long term projections for the Bloomsbury Group under a number of scenarios taking account of risks 
and probabilities.
   The Upper Vesting Threshold is an achievable but highly stretching target based on long term Group projections.
Based on the above, therefore, the EPS targets attached to the 2011 awards were as follows:
Lower Vesting threshold
  Level of vesting 30%
  Target for Normalised EPS 10.7 pence
Mid Vesting threshold
  Level of vesting 66%
  Target for Normalised EPS 11.5 pence
Upper Vesting threshold
  Level of vesting 100%
  Target for Normalised EPS 14 pence
Vesting is on a straight line basis between the Lower to Mid Vesting thresholds and between the Mid to Upper Vesting 
thresholds. There is no vesting below the Lower Vesting threshold. The maximum level of vesting is 100%. 
The Committee intends to follow a substantially similar approach to that applied to the 2011 LTIP for setting stretching EPS 
performance targets for LTIP awards in subsequent years.
During the year the Committee has reviewed the measurement of EPS used for LTIP awards and concluded that audited 
Adjusted EPS remains an appropriate measure for Normalised EPS performance targets for the LTIP. This measure of 
EPS is consistent with the forecasts published by City analysts and ensures the performance required for LTIP awards 
to vest is both clear to management and aligned with the interests of the shareholders. The Committee considers that 
stretching absolute targets for EPS provide the greatest clarity to management to motivate them to achieve the long term 
performance required in order for LTIP awards to vest.

 * In respect of LTIP awards from 2012 and onwards the Committee intends to reduce threshold vesting in accordance with best practice.
Vesting is on a straight line basis between the Lower to 
Upper Vesting thresholds based on ranking within the 
comparator group. There is no vesting below the Lower 
Vesting threshold. The maximum level of vesting is 100%.
The terms of the LTIP awards permit the Committee to 
restrict vesting in circumstances where the Committee 
considers that the Company's TSR rank in the comparator 
group is not reflective of the underlying performance of 
the Company.
Vesting of awards
The vesting of LTIP awards is subject to the approval of 
the Committee and to which the Committee will apply its 
Intervention Policy. Under this policy the Committee may 
apply its independent discretion to modify the measurement 
of EPS to ensure that the interests of management are 
aligned with those of the shareholders. For example, the 
Committee may review the appropriateness of treatment of 
highlighted items with regards to the calculation of EPS used 
for determining the level of vesting.
The Committee will consider the impact of share buy-backs 
over the relevant performance periods for the purposes of 
determining the level of vesting of share incentive awards.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme 
(Sharesave )
Subject to the approval of the Committee each executive 
director is eligible to voluntarily participate in the 
Company's all-employee HM Revenue and Customs 
approved Sharesave scheme. The Company intends to run 
a new Sharesave scheme annually. A Sharesave scheme 
allows participants to make 36 equal monthly instalments 
under a building society savings contract. On maturity of 
the savings contract, participants may use the savings plus 
interest to purchase shares under share options granted 
at a discount of 15% to the market price at the start of the 
savings contract. Company policy is to limit the monthly 
savings into any Sharesave scheme to  100 per participant 
and to limit the total monthly savings into all Sharesave 
schemes to  250.
Details of the Directors' outstanding Sharesave options are 
shown in Part B of this report.
Change of control provisions for share 
incentive schemes
On a change of control, LTIP awards vest to the extent 
that the performance conditions, as adjusted for the 
reduced vesting period due to the change of control, 
have been achieved subject to settlement of taxes arising 
on vesting. The Committee determines a reasonable 
basis for measuring the extent to which the performance 
conditions have been achieved. Sharesave options become 
exercisable on a change of control, however the treatment 
for tax would be subject to HM Revenue & Customs 
regulations that apply at the time.
Remuneration earned by the executive 
directors from outside appointments
Significant external appointments of the Directors are 
given in the bibliographic details on pages 41 and 42. 
The Committee considers that the external appointments 
of the executive directors have no detrimental impact 
on the performance of their duties. The Committee has 
approved that each executive director may retain his or 
her remuneration earned from external appointments up 
to  15,000 per year.
Contracts of service
The Company's policy is for executive directors to have 
contracts of employment with notice periods of up to 12 
months. The Company will not enter into service contracts 
of more than two years duration without obtaining prior 
shareholder approval. Contracts with notice periods in 
excess of 12 months will only be considered at the time of 
recruitment and would normally be structured so that the 
notice period reduces to a period up to 12 months over a 
specified time of service. 66

Newton and no automatic right to payments.
The payment of bonus and the vesting of LTIP awards on 
termination are subject to the discretion of the Committee.
In the event of early termination, the Committee would 
seek to take such steps as necessary to mitigate the loss to 
the Company and to ensure that the executive director 
observed his or her duty to mitigate loss. The Committee 
considers the termination terms of the executive 
directors to be appropriate to avoid rewarding failure on 
termination.
Non-executive directors
The annual fees of non-executive directors (NEDs ) upon 
appointment are determined by the Chairman and the 
executive directors. The annual fee of the Chairman upon 
appointment is determined by the other NEDs and the 
executive directors. NEDs receive a basic annual fee plus 
an extra annual amount for additional responsibilities 
such as chairing sub-committees. The fees of the NEDs 
and Chairman are reviewed regularly against benchmark 
data provided by external remuneration consultants 
New Bridge Street. Where NEDs and the Chairman receive 
an increase in annual fee this is normally limited to the 
budgeted annual increase in salaries for Bloomsbury 
employees. During 2010 the NEDs and Chairman elected to 
take a cut of 10% in their annual fees which was restored 
from 1 January 2011.
NED fees for the upcoming financial year are:
Non-executive directors Fee for year to 28 February 2013 Roles
Jeremy Wilson  100,609 Chairman of the Board
Sarah Jane Thomson  38,272 Chair of the Remuneration Committee
Ian Cormack  38,550 Chair of the Audit Committee and 
Senior Independent Director
The continuance of service of each non-executive director is reviewed annually by the Chairman.
The non-executive directors and Chairman do not participate in the Company's annual bonus or share incentive schemes 
including Sharesave.
