Overview Business r eview Governance Financial s Ta Temen Ts cO mpany in FOrma Ti On Dear shareholder
i 
am delighted to present the Directors' Remuneration 
Report for Bloomsbury Publishing Plc for the year 
ended 28 February 2013 (the  Report'). The Report 
has been prepared on behalf of the Bloomsbury 
Board by the Remuneration Committee (the  Committee') 
and has been approved by the Board. As required by the 
Companies Act 2006 (the  Act'), a resolution to approve the 
Report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
The Committee has adopted the principles of good 
governance relating to Directors' Remuneration as set out 
in the UK Corporate Governance Code (the  Code'). The 
report complies with the Act and the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority. The Company has complied 
with the provisions of the Code relating to Directors' 
Remuneration throughout the year. 
The Report incorporates a number of changes in the 
spirit of the forthcoming legislation on Directors' pay, as 
developed by the Department of Business, Innovation and 
Skills ( BIS'). The Company will be required to adopt the 
new legislation in full for the 2013/14 Remuneration Report.
Consistent with the draft BIS proposals, the Report is split 
into two sections (see below):
   Part A, the Remuneration Policy Report, which sets out the 
policy on the remuneration of the Executive and Non-
Executive Directors, and
   Part B, the Implementation Report, which discloses how 
the Remuneration Policy has been implemented for the 
year ended 28 February 2013.
The Act requires the External Auditor to state whether, 
in their opinion, certain parts of the Report have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the applicable 
regulations. Part B-1 has been audited while Part A and Part 
B-2 are not subject to audit.
Key message and changes during the year
Bloomsbury delivered another good set of results for 
the year against the background of a rapidly evolving 
publishing market place and the generally slow economic 
environment in many areas of the world. The Committee 
recognises the strong performance and hard work of  an 
exceptional management team in their delivery of the 
Board's strategic aims which are set out in the Overview 
and Business Review sections of the Annual Report on 
pages 2 to 36.
In applying the Remuneration Policy (see below) the 
Committee's priority is to ensure that the interests of the 
shareholders and, where beneficial to the shareholders, 
other stakeholders are served whilst the Executive Directors 
and senior management team are treated fairly. In 
reaching its decisions the Committee considers the views 
and feedback it receives from shareholders and other 
members of the shareholder corporate governance 
community together with the views of management.
During of the financial year ended 28 February 2013 the 
Committee:
Fixed pay and annual bonus
   Approved no increase in basic salaries for Executive 
Directors in respect of the year ended 28 February 2014 
in line with a pay freeze for higher paid employees 
across the Group;
   Approved that bonuses should not be paid for 
Executive Directors and the senior management team. 
The Committee sets stretching targets for an annual 
bonus taking account of the performance needed to 
beat both the consensus forecast of City analysts and 
stretching operational targets. Whilst the strong results 
for the year achieved by the management team came 
close to hitting the threshold bonus target, no bonuses 
will be payable;
Long Term Incentive Plan
   Approved the grant of 2012 LTIP awards to the Executive 
Directors and senior managers with vesting targets 
that ensure stretching performance is required for 
minimum threshold vesting and that the highest levels 
of performance are required for full vesting;
   Approved vesting restricted to a level of 50% for the 
LTIP awards granted in 2009;

Remuneration process and corporate governance
   From listening to the feedback received from 
shareholders and the shareholder corporate 
governance community:
   Introduced Executive Director Share Ownership 
Guidelines; 
   Amended the Remuneration Policy for LTIP awards 
granted with TSR performance conditions to reduce 
the level of minimum threshold vesting in line with 
best practice;
   Reduced the number of vesting thresholds for 
awards granted with EPS performance conditions;
   Reviewed the structure of Executive Director 
remuneration and concluded that the levels as a 
percentage of basic salary for LTIP awards under 
the Remuneration Policy continue to provide an 
appropriate incentive to attract, retain and motivate 
the Executive Directors to achieve the highest levels 
of performance that is aligned with the longer-term 
interests of the shareholders;
   Considered the draft BIS proposals; and
   Reviewed the Committee's procedures against its Terms 
of Reference, which were recently replaced with best 
practice terms. 
Remuneration of the Chairman and  
Non-Executive Directors
The Board approved no increase to the annual fees of the 
Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors in respect of the 
year ended 28 February 2014.
In conclusion, the Committee considers that the 
Remuneration Policy continues to incentivise the 
sustainable delivery of the Board's strategy, strong 
financial performance and the creation of long term 
shareholder value.

remuneration committee
Membership
Throughout the year ended 28 February 2013 the 
Committee has comprised three Independent Non-
Executive Directors, namely Sarah Jane Thomson, Ian 
Cormack and Jeremy Wilson. Sarah Jane Thomson has 
chaired the Committee since 28 May 2010. The Company 
Secretary, Michael Daykin, acts as secretary to the 
Committee.
Assistance to the Committee
During the year the Committee took advice from external 
remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street, which do not 
perform other services for and have no other connection 
with the Company. The Committee is free to choose its 
advisors and is satisfied that New Bridge Street continues to 
provide advice that is objective and independent.
The Committee received assistance from the Company 
Secretary and, where specifically requested by the 
Committee, the Chief Executive and Finance Director. 
The Committee has considered any feedback received 
from the major shareholders during the year as part of 
Bloomsbury's ongoing investor relations programme 
and considers the reports and recommendations of 
shareholder representative bodies and corporate 
governance analysts.
Responsibilities and activities of the Committee
The Committee determines the Remuneration Policy and 
annual remuneration plans for the Executive Directors 
for approval by the Board. In particular, the Committee 
approves for each Executive Director the basic salaries, 
pensions, other benefits, bonus awards and the awards 
made under Bloomsbury's Long Term incentive Plan (see 
below). The Committee approves all payments of bonus and 
the vesting of LTIP awards before payments are made for 
each Executive Director. The Committee approves whether 
Executive Directors may participate in the Company's 
Sharesave scheme (see below) in years when it is run.
The Committee considers it is appropriate for the Executive 
Directors to determine the remuneration plans of senior 
management. In respect of employees below the level of 
the Board, the Committee approves the bonus pool from 
which bonuses are paid and approves the grant/vesting of 
all LTIP awards before payments are made.
The Committee met formally on six occasions during the 
year including five occasions without the Executive Directors 
present and on one occasion with an Executive Director 
attending at the request of the Committee for specific 
items on the agenda. New Bridge Street attends Committee

1) Basic salary
Operation
Basic salaries for the Executive Directors are reviewed 
annually and are set at levels that take account of the 
performance, experience and responsibilities of each 
individual concerned having regard to the prevailing 
market conditions and the budgeted annual increase in 
basic salaries for Bloomsbury employees generally. On 
appointment, the basic salaries for Executive Directors 
take account of appropriate market competitive ranges 
from companies of a similar size and complexity. The 
Committee determines as a proportion of basic salary the 
level of opportunity to earn a performance related annual 
bonus, the level of opportunity to earn long-term incentive 
awards and Company contributions to a contributory 
pension scheme. 
Levels of basic salary
In respect of the year ended 28 February 2014, the Group's 
lower paid employees are budgeted to receive pay 
increases in line with the publishing industry. Increases for 
higher paid employees have been limited to 0% subject 
to adjustments for promotions. This should increase the 
significance of performance related pay to managers 
across the business.
The current basic salaries for the Executive Directors are as 
follows:
Executive Director
From
1 March
2013
 '000
From
1 March
2012

Nigel Newton 395 395
Richard Charkin 323 323
Wendy Pallot 226 226
2) pension contributions
Executive Directors may receive contributions from the 
Company to their contributory pensions schemes based on 
a percentage, determined by the Committee, of their basic 
salary. The rates of pension contributions are:
Executive Director
Pension contribution 
to contributory 
scheme
(% of basic salary)
Nigel Newton 15%
Wendy Pallot 10%
Richard Charkin 0%
[1]
[1] 
 On his appointment, the basic salary of Richard Charkin included an allowance 
in lieu of pension at a level of 10% of basic salary excluding pension. No further 
pension contributions have been made by the Company to Richard Charkin.
3) Other benefits
The Company offers Executive Directors a car or a 
cash alternative and benefits including life assurance, 
permanent health cover, private medical cover and other 
minor benefits such as a discount on Bloomsbury books. 
Wendy Pallot receives a non-pensionable cash alternative 
of  10,000 to a car allowance. On his appointment in 2007, 
Richard Charkin received an uplift in basic salary of  10,000 
in lieu of a car allowance.

4) performance related annual bonus
The Committee determines the policy on an annual cash 
bonus scheme for the Executive Directors and the eligibility 
of Executive Directors to participate in the scheme. The 
Committee is satisfied that the annual cash bonus strongly 
aligns the interests of Executive Directors with those of the 
shareholders and that the bonus provides the Executive 
Directors with a strong incentive for the highest levels of 
performance over the coming financial year.
The annual bonus opportunity, as a percentage of basic 
salary for the Executive Directors, for the year just ended 
and for 2013/14 is as follows:
Actual bonus opportunities
Period end:
28 February 
2014
28 February 
2013
Profit Related bonus 70% 70%
Personal Objectives bonus 10% 10%
Strategic Objectives bonus 20% 20%
Maximum bonus opportunity 100% 100%
Operation of the bonus pool
Bonuses paid to the Executive Directors and other 
managers in the business are paid from a bonus pool 
approved by the Committee. The bonus pool is calculated 
by applying formulae based on Adjusted Profit and targets 
set by the Committee. If there is a short-fall in the bonus 
pool such that the pool is not sufficient to fund full bonuses 
then the bonuses for the Executive Directors and other 
managers are scaled back in proportion to the short-fall.
The Committee sets a minimum target for Adjusted Profit 
below which no bonuses are paid. The minimum target 
is in line with City analysts' key indices, namely forecast 
Adjusted Profit.
Profit measurement for annual cash bonus
Consistent with other UK listed companies in the media 
sector, the Committee considers that audited Adjusted 
Profit from continuing operations (that is profit from 
continuing operations before amortisation, highlighted 
items and tax) to be an appropriate financial measure 
for the performance targets for profit related bonus. This 
measure of underlying performance is consistent with 
the profit forecasts that City analysts publish and ensures 
that the majority of the annual cash bonus and the short-
term financial achievement of the Executive Directors are 
aligned with the interests of the shareholders.
The Committee may use its independent discretion to 
adjust bonus payments in order to ensure they are aligned 
with the interests of shareholders. The Committee considers 
each highlighted item that is excluded from Adjusted Profit 
and determines whether, in the opinion of the Committee, 
the treatment with respect to bonus is in the interests of 
shareholders.
In determining whether highlighted items may be 
excluded from Adjusted Profit for the purposes of 
calculating the bonus the Committee applies the following 
criteria:
   the highlighted items relate to important strategic 
steps instructed by the Board that have been taken to 
strengthen the business;
   future profits should benefit from the investment value 
of the highlighted items;
   failure to implement the strategic steps and incur the 
highlighted items would have been detrimental to the 
interests of the shareholders;
   management has mitigated the quantum of the 
highlighted items; and
   the highlighted items are measureable, properly 
accounted for and audited.
The Committee also takes account of whether highlighted 
items have arisen as a result of the Executive Directors 
achieving their personal and strategic bonus objectives 
approved by the Committee.
Further information on the annual bonus can be found 
below in Part B.

Overview Business r eview Governance Financial s Ta Temen Ts cO mpany in FOrma Ti On 5) long term incentive plans
The Company's primary long term incentive plan ( LTIP') 
is the Bloomsbury Publishing Plc 2005 Performance Share 
Plan which was approved by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting held on 27 September 2005. LTIP awards 
are made by the Committee to the Executive Directors and 
managers below Board level.
Details of the Directors' LTIP awards granted, vesting  
and outstanding for the financial year are shown below in 
Part B-1.
Level of LTIP awards
The policy of the Committee is to apply a maximum award 
level of 75% of basic salary for the Chief Executive, 66% 
for the other Executive Directors and lower levels for 
individuals below the level of the Board.
The Committee may use its discretion to approve a  
one-time enhanced award to an Executive Director upon 
their appointment to the Board. The purpose is to increase 
the exposure of the Executive Director to the risks and 
rewards of share ownership early on in their appointment 
so that their interests are aligned with the shareholders. 
The terms of the LTIP approved by the shareholders permit 
awards to be granted to Executive Directors and senior 
individuals in excess of the policy of the Committee up to  
a maximum level of 150% of basic salary per annum.
Executive Director LTIP award levels, as operated last  
year and as intended to be operated going forward,  
are as follows:
% of basic 
salary
Nigel Newton 75%
Richard Charkin 66%
Wendy Pallot 66%
Performance conditions for LTIP awards
LTIP awards are subject to two non-concurrent 
performance conditions, namely 50% of the awards are 
subject to normalised earnings per share ( EPS') targets 
and 50% of the awards are subject to Total Shareholder 
Return ( TSR') targets at the end of a three year period. LTIP 
awards lapse in the event that the conditions are not met at 
the end of the three year performance period.
The Committee has reviewed the LTIP and concluded 
that non-concurrent rather than concurrent EPS 
and TSR performance conditions provide the most 
effective incentive to align the long-term interests of 
LTIP participants with the long-term interests of the 
shareholders.
The Committee determines performance conditions for 
each LTIP award at the time of making an award.
TSR targets
The performance conditions used for outstanding LTIP 
awards are set out below in Part B-1. The policy for setting 
performance conditions for new grants of awards can be 
summarised as:
Parameter Details

trusts

The terms of the LTIP awards permit the Committee to 
restrict vesting in circumstances where the Committee 
considers that the Company's TSR rank in the Comparator 
Group is not reflective of the underlying performance of 
the Company.

LTIP awards with EPS targets
The Committee takes the following approach to setting EPS 
performance targets for LTIP awards:
   The threshold normalised EPS target is set with reference 
to City Analysts' indices for Adjusted EPS prevailing at 
the time the awards are granted; and
   The maximum normalised EPS target is an achievable 
but highly stretching target based on long-term 
projections for the Group under different scenarios.
Vesting is on a straight line basis between threshold  
and maximum targets. There is no vesting below the 
threshold target.
Awards in previous years also contained a  Mid Vesting' 
target. During the year the Committee reviewed this 
structure and concluded that eliminating the  Mid Vesting' 
threshold made the relationship between reward and 
performance clearer over the full range of the EPS targets. 
This change applies to the 2012 LTIP and onwards.
The Committee considers that audited Adjusted diluted 
EPS from continuing and discontinued operations (see 
note 11 of the Financial Statements on page 97) remains 
an appropriate measure for normalised EPS performance 
targets for the LTIP. This measure of EPS is consistent with 
the forecasts for EPS published by City analysts and ensures 
the performance required for LTIP awards to vest is both 
clear to management and the shareholders and aligned 
with the interests of the shareholders.
The Committee considers that the absolute EPS targets 
provide the greatest clarity to shareholders and 
management on the long-term performance required in 
order for LTIP awards to vest.
vesting of awards
The vesting of LTIP awards is subject to the approval 
of the Committee and to which the Committee will 
apply its Intervention Policy. Under this policy the 
Committee may apply its independent discretion to 
modify the measurement of EPS to ensure that the 
interests of management are aligned with those of the 
shareholders. For example, the Committee may review the 
appropriateness of the treatment of highlighted items with 
regards to the calculation of EPS used for determining the 
level of vesting.
The Committee will consider the impact of share buy-backs 
over the relevant performance periods for the purposes of 
determining the level of vesting of share incentive awards.
Savings related share option scheme (Sharesave )
Subject to the approval of the Committee each Executive 
Director is eligible to voluntarily participate in the 
Company's all-employee HM Revenue and Customs 
approved Sharesave scheme. The Company intends to run 
a new annual Sharesave scheme in most years. A Sharesave 
scheme allows participants to make 36 equal monthly 
instalments under a building society savings contract. 
On maturity of the savings contract, participants may use 
the savings plus interest to purchase shares under share 
options granted at a discount of 15% to the market price at 
the start of the savings contract. Company policy is to limit 
the monthly savings into any Sharesave scheme to  100 
per participant and to limit the total monthly savings into 
all Sharesave schemes to  250.
Details of the Executive Directors' outstanding Sharesave 
options are shown in Part B-1 below.
6) executive Director share Ownership 
Guidelines
During the year ended 28 February 2013 the Committee 
implemented the Executive Director Share Ownership 
Guidelines.
Under the guidelines the Executive Directors are expected 
to build and maintain a shareholding valued at 100% of 
basic salary with no upper limit on the number of shares 
they may hold. A time limit is not set to accumulate the 
shareholding however Executive Directors are required to 
retain all shares arising from vested LTIP awards (net of tax) 
or purchase shares until the shareholding guideline is met. 
The number of shares needed to satisfy the shareholding is 
recalculated annually at the close of the next business day 
following the announcement of the full year results taking 
account of changes to basic salary.
Part B-2 below includes a review of achievement of the 
shareholding guideline for each Executive Director.

Overview Business r eview Governance Financial s Ta Temen Ts cO mpany in FOrma Ti On composition of remuneration packages
A significant proportion of the remuneration of each 
Executive Director is expected to accrue through variable 
elements which are dependent on the performance of the

Other remuneration matters
Change of control provisions for share incentive schemes
On a change of control, LTIP awards vest to the extent that the performance conditions, as adjusted for the reduced 
vesting period due to the change of control, have been achieved subject to settlement of taxes arising on vesting. The 
Committee determines a reasonable basis for measuring the extent to which the performance conditions have been 
achieved. Sharesave options become exercisable on a change of control, however the treatment for tax would be subject 
to HM Revenue & Customs regulations that apply at the time.
Remuneration earned by the Executive Directors from outside appointments
Significant external appointments of the Directors are given in the bibliographic details on pages 37 and 38. The 
Committee considers that the external appointments of the Executive Directors have no detrimental impact on the 
performance of their duties. The Committee has approved that each Executive Director may retain his or her remuneration 
earned from external appointments up to  15,000 per year.
Contracts of service
The Company's policy is for Executive Directors to have contracts of employment with notice periods of up to 12 months. 
The Company will not enter into service contracts of more than two years duration without obtaining prior shareholder 
approval. Contracts with notice periods in excess of 12 months will only be considered at the time of recruitment and would 
normally be structured so that the notice period reduces to a period up to 12 months over a specified time of service.

Details of the service contracts of the Executive Directors who served during the year are set out below:
Executive Directors Date of agreement Date of expiry Notice period
Nigel Newton 24 June 2003 - 12 Months
Richard Charkin 10 October 2007 - 12 Months
Wendy Pallot 10 March 2011 - 12 Months
Termination of Executive Director appointments
The service agreements of Richard Charkin and Wendy Pallot include terms such that there would be no claim for loss 
of office as a Director resulting from termination of their service agreement. The agreement for Wendy Pallot includes 
that the Company may make a payment of basic salary in lieu of notice. There are no further specific provisions for 
compensation on early termination of service contracts for the Executive Directors including Nigel Newton and no 
automatic right to payments.
The payment of bonus and the vesting of LTIP awards on termination are subject to the discretion of the Committee. 
In the event of early termination, the Committee would seek to take such steps as necessary to mitigate the loss to the 
Company and to ensure that the Executive Director observed his or her duty to mitigate loss. The Committee considers the 
termination terms of the Executive Directors to be appropriate to avoid rewarding failure on termination.
non-executive Directors
The annual fees of Non-Executive Directors ( NED's) upon appointment are determined by the Chairman and the 
Executive Directors. The annual fee of the Chairman upon appointment is determined by the other NEDs and the Executive 
Directors. NEDs receive a basic annual fee plus an extra annual amount for additional responsibilities such as chairing sub-
committees. The fees of the NEDs and chairman are reviewed against benchmark data provided by external remuneration 
consultants. Where NEDs and the Chairman receive an increase in annual fee this is normally limited to the budgeted 
annual increase in salaries for Bloomsbury employees.
No annual increase has been awarded to NED fees from 1 March 2013 in line with basic salary increases for senior 
employees across the Group. The fees for the NEDs are:
