ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear Shareholder
I am delighted to present the Directors' Remuneration 
Report for Bloomsbury Publishing Plc for the year ended 
28 February 2014 (the  Report'). The Report has been 
prepared on behalf of the Bloomsbury Board by the 
Remuneration Committee (the  Committee') and has been 
approved by the Board. 
Outline of the Remuneration Report
The Report is split into the following two sections:
   Part A, the Remuneration Policy Report, which sets 
out the Remuneration Policy for the Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors which, subject to shareholder 
approval, operates from 1 March 2014 and will become 
formally effective from the 2014 AGM; and
   Part B, the Annual Report on Remuneration, which 
discloses how the Remuneration Policy will be 
implemented for the year ending 28 February 2015  
and how it was implemented for the year ended  
28 February 2014. 
The Directors' Remuneration Policy Report will be subject 
to a binding shareholder vote and the Annual Report on 
Remuneration will be subject to an advisory shareholder 
vote at the forthcoming AGM on 22 July 2014. In future the 
Directors' Remuneration Policy Report will be subject to a 
binding vote every three years (sooner if changes are made 
to the policy) and the Annual Report on Remuneration will 
be subject to an annual advisory vote.
Performance and Reward for 2013/14
Bloomsbury delivered another good performance for the 
year ended 28 February 2014 against the background of 
a publishing market place that continues to evolve and a 
relatively stable economic environment. The Committee 
set stretching annual bonus targets (see below) for the year 
and it is to the credit of the business that it has beaten the 
threshold target for PBTA allowing bonuses to be paid at an 
average rate of 17% of the maximum bonus.
The 2010 long-term incentive awards, which were 
determined by a combination of earnings per share 
(50% of awards) and relative total shareholder return 
performance (50% of awards), only vested at 50% of the 
maximum in 2013/14 as while the maximum earnings per 
share target was exceeded, the threshold total shareholder 
return target was not met.
Remuneration Policy for 2014/15
The Remuneration Committee continually reviews the 
Executive Director Remuneration Policy to ensure it 
promotes the attraction, motivation and retention of the 
high quality Executive Directors who have been key to 
delivering the Company's strategy in the past and who 
will be key to delivering sustainable earnings growth 
and shareholder return in the future. For 2014/15 the 
Committee has concluded that:
   basic salaries should be increased by 3% in line with 
the general workforce for the Group (this follows a pay 
freeze in respect of the previous year);
   there will be no changes to other elements of fixed 
pay (i.e. benefit and pension provision) except that the 
pension contribution for Wendy Pallot of 10% of basic 
salary should be increased in line with market norms to 
15% of basic salary;
   the structure and quantum of the annual bonus 
arrangement continues to work well. Therefore, the 
maximum bonus potential will remain at 100% of salary 
and the structure of the 2014/15 annual bonus will be 
broadly similar to that operated for 2013/14. A claw-
back provision, introduced for 2014/15, will operate in 
respect of the annual bonus for the Executive Directors; 
and
   the long-term incentive policy, operated under 
the Bloomsbury Share Plan 2005 ( PSP'), whereby 
conditional share awards are granted annually with 
vesting based on earnings per share (50%) and relative 
total shareholder return (50%) performance conditions 
and continued service, provide a strong alignment 
between the senior executive team and shareholders. 
However, as a result of the PSP nearing the end of its 
10 year life, shareholder consent for a replacement 
plan will be sought at the 2014 AGM. The new plan will 
be broadly similar to the plan it replaces although, 
subject to shareholder approval, it will be aligned to 
market practice both in respect of quantum (annual 
award levels will be increased from 75% of salary for the 
Chief Executive and 66% of salary for other Directors 
to 100% of salary for all Executive Directors) and a 
number of provisions will be aligned to best practice 
(e.g. threshold vesting levels will be reduced, maximum 
and exceptional award limits reduced and claw-back 
provisions will operate).

Shareholder feedback
In applying the Remuneration Policy, the Committee's 
priority is to ensure that the interests of the shareholders 
and, where beneficial to the shareholders, other 
stakeholders are served whilst the Executive Directors and 
senior management team are treated fairly. In reaching its 
decisions the Committee considers the views and feedback 
it receives from shareholders and other members of the 
shareholder corporate governance community together 
with the views of management. Major shareholders 
and representative bodies were consulted in early 2014 
in respect to the proposed changes to the long-term 
incentive policy. 
In conclusion, the Committee considers that the 
Remuneration Policy will incentivise the sustainable delivery 
of the Board's strategy, strong financial performance and 
the creation of long-term shareholder value.

PART A - Remuneration Policy Report
Introduction
The Committee has adopted the principles of good 
governance relating to Directors' Remuneration as set out 
in the UK Corporate Governance Code issued June 2010 
and September 2012 (the  Codes'). This Report, together 
with the Annual Report on Remuneration, complies with 
the Companies Act 2006 (the  Act'), the UKLA Listing 
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and Directors' 
Remuneration: the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013. The Company has complied with the 
provisions of the Codes relating to Directors' Remuneration 
throughout the year. 
In determining Remuneration Policy the Committee applies 
the key principles that remuneration should:
   attract and retain suitably high calibre Executive 
Directors and ensure that they are motivated to achieve 
the highest levels of performance including delivering 
strategic initiatives and objectives;
   align the interests of the Executive Directors with those 
of the shareholders; and
   not pay more than is necessary.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received 
in relation to the AGM each year. This feedback, plus any 
additional feedback received during any meetings from 
time to time, is then considered as part of the Group's 
annual review of the Remuneration Policy. In addition, 
the Remuneration Committee will seek to engage directly 
with major shareholders and their representative bodies 
should any material changes be made to the Remuneration 
Policy. Major shareholders and representative bodies were 
consulted in early 2014 in respect to the proposed changes 
to the long-term incentive policy.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to 
approve last year's remuneration report and any matters 
discussed with shareholders during the year are set out in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group
The Committee considers the general basic salary increase 
for the broader employee population when determining 
the annual salary increases for the Executive Directors. 
Employees have not been consulted in respect of the 
design of the Group's Executive Director Remuneration 
Policy, although the Committee will keep this under review. 
The relative increase in CEO pay for the year under review, 
as compared with that of the general workforce, is set out in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration. The Committee also 
considers environmental, social and governance issues and 
risk when reviewing executive pay quantum and structure.

Notes to the Summary Policy Table:
1. A description of how the Company intends to 
implement the policy set out in this table from the 
2014 AGM onwards is set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration on pages 72 to 81.
2. Remuneration arrangements below Board level tend to 
be skewed more towards fixed pay with less of a focus on 
share-based long-term incentive pay. These differences 
have arisen from the development of remuneration 
arrangements that are market competitive for the 
various categories of individuals.
3. The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the 
annual bonus scheme reflect the Committee's belief that 
any incentive compensation should be appropriately 
challenging and tied to both the delivery of profit 
growth and personal and strategic objectives. 
4. The TSR and EPS performance conditions applicable to 
the PSP were selected by the Remuneration Committee 
on the basis that they reward the delivery of long-term 
returns to shareholders and the Company's financial 
growth and are consistent with the Company's 
objective of delivering superior levels of long-term 
value to shareholders. The TSR performance condition 
is monitored on the Committee's behalf by New Bridge 
Street whilst the Group's EPS growth is derived from the 
audited financial statements.
5. While PSP awards currently vest after three years 
subject to continued service and performance targets, 
the Committee will consider developments in best 
practice when setting future long-term incentive grant 
policies and, in particular, whether the introduction 
of a post vesting holding period, in addition to the 
existing shareholding guidelines, is appropriate for the 
Company.
6. The all-employee Sharesave scheme does not have 
performance conditions. 
7. For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors' 
Remuneration Policy, authority is given to the Company 
to honour any commitments entered into with current 
or former Directors (such as the payment of a pension, 
payment of last year's annual bonus or the vesting/
exercise of share awards granted in the past). Details of 
any payments to former Directors will be set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.
Discretion of the Committee
The Committee will operate the annual bonus and PSP 
schemes according to the respective scheme rules (or 
relevant documents) and in accordance with the applicable 
regulations. Executive Director incentive schemes and 
remuneration plans are designed to align the interests of 
management with those of the shareholders and are kept 
as simple as possible. Where the outcome of incentives is 
not as the Committee intended it may use its independent 
discretion to intervene and modify the outcomes to 
align the interests of management with those of the 
shareholders.
The Committee has adopted terms of reference based on 
best practice and may apply its independent discretion in  
a number of ways through its conditional approval 
including for:
Share-based incentives
   granting of all discretionary share awards/options and 
determining the participants (including for Executive 
Directors and below the Board), timing of grants, size 
of awards, performance conditions and how vested 
awards should be satisfied;
   running the Sharesave scheme to ensure that the 
scheme is run within applicable dilution limits;
   vesting of all discretionary share awards/options 
including the timing and level of vesting;
   non-routine vesting of all-employee share options 
in the unlikely event needed to ensure the effective 
operation of the schemes under the applicable 
regulations and rules;
Annual bonuses
   making annual bonus awards to the Executive Directors 
and determining the level of awards, targets and 
conditions and calibration of bonuses;
   the Group bonus pool and the level of bonus pay-outs 
for the Executive Directors and managers below Board 
level who participate in the Group bonus scheme;
   bonus payments to Executive Directors following the 
assessment of performance measures and achievement 
against bonus objectives;

Routine payments

Notes:
   The minimum performance scenario comprises the 
fixed elements of remuneration only, based on salary 
and pension as per the policy for 2014/15 and estimated 
benefits based on 2013/14.
   The target level of bonus is taken to be 50% of the 
maximum bonus opportunity (100% of salary), and 
the target level of PSP vesting is assumed to be 50% of 
the face value assuming a normal grant level (100% 
of salary). These values are included in addition to the 
components/values of minimum remuneration. 
   Maximum assumes full bonus pay-out (100% of salary) 
and the full face value of the PSP (100% of salary), in 
addition to fixed components of remuneration.
   For simplicity, no share price growth has been factored 
into the calculations. The value of any Sharesave awards 
and notional dividends accruing on vested LTIP shares 
has been excluded.
Executive Director Share Ownership Guidelines
Under the guidelines the Executive Directors are expected 
to build and maintain a shareholding valued at 100% of 
basic salary with no upper limit on the number of shares 
they may hold. A time limit is not set to accumulate the 
shareholding, however, Executive Directors are required to 
retain all shares arising from vested PSP awards (net of tax) 
or purchase shares until the shareholding guideline is met. 
The number of shares needed to satisfy the shareholding is 
recalculated annually at the close of the next business day 
following the announcement of the full year results taking 
account of changes to basic salary.
Remuneration earned by the Executive 
Directors from outside appointments
Significant external appointments of the Directors are 
given in the bibliographic details on pages 46 and 47. 
The Committee considers that the external appointments 
of the Executive Directors have no detrimental impact 
on the performance of their duties. The Committee has 
approved that each Executive Director may retain his or her 
remuneration earned from external appointments up to 
 15,000 per year.

Approach to recruitment and promotions
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director 
would be set in accordance with the terms of the 
Company's prevailing approved Remuneration Policy 
at the time of appointment and would take into account 
the skills and experience of the individual, the market rate 
for a candidate of that experience and the importance of 
securing the relevant individual.
Salary would be provided at such a level as required to 
attract the most appropriate candidate and may be set 
initially at a below mid-market level on the basis that it may 
progress towards the mid-market level once expertise 
and performance have been proven and sustained. The 
annual bonus potential would be limited to 100% of 
salary and grants under the PSP would be limited to 100% 
of salary (150% of salary in exceptional circumstances). 
In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash 
and/or share-based elements to replace deferred or 
incentive pay forfeited by an Executive leaving a previous 
employer. It would seek to ensure, where possible, that 
these awards would be consistent with awards forfeited in 
terms of vesting periods, expected value and performance 
conditions.
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any 
variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior 
role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms. In 
addition, any other on-going remuneration obligations 
existing prior to appointment may continue. 
For external and internal appointments, the Committee 
may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation 
and/or incidental expenses as appropriate.
If appropriate the Committee may agree, on the 
recruitment of a new Executive Director, a notice period in 
excess of 12 months but to reduce this to 12 months over a 
specified period.
At the Board's discretion, early termination of an Executive 
Director's service contract may be undertaken by way of 
payment of salary and benefits in lieu of the required notice 
period (or shorter period where permitted by the contract 
of service or where agreed with the Executive Director) 
and the Committee would take such steps as necessary to 
mitigate the loss to the Company and to ensure that the 
Executive Director observed his or her duty to mitigate loss. 
Annual bonus may be payable with respect to the period 
of the financial year served although it will be pro-rated 
for time and paid at the normal payout date. Any share-
based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under 
the Company's share plans will be determined based on 
the relevant plan rules. However, in certain prescribed 
circumstances, such as death, ill-health, injury, disability, 
redundancy, retirement, sale of employing business or 
other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, 
good leaver  status may be applied.  For good leavers, 
awards will normally vest at the normal vesting date, 
subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance 
conditions at that time and reduced pro-rata to reflect the 
proportion of the performance period actually served. 
However, the Remuneration Committee has the discretion 
to determine that awards vest at cessation of employment 
and/or not to pro-rate awards.
Non-Executive Directors
Each of the Non-Executive Directors ( NEDs') has similar 
general terms for their agreement which can be found 
on Bloomsbury's investor relations website at www.
bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. The agreements provide for three 
months notice by the Director or by the Company with the 
option for the Company to terminate an appointment at 
any time on payment of three months fees in lieu of notice. 
Termination of the agreements is without compensation.

The annual fees of NEDs, excluding the Chairman, are 
determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. 
The annual fee of the Chairman is determined by the other 
NEDs and the Executive Directors. NEDs receive a basic 
annual fee plus an extra annual amount for additional 
responsibilities such as chairing Board committees. The fees 
of the NEDs and Chairman are periodically reviewed against 
benchmark data provided by external remuneration 
consultants. Where NEDs and the Chairman receive an 
increase in annual fee this is normally limited to the annual 
increase in salaries for Bloomsbury employees. The NEDs 
and Chairman do not participate in the Company's annual 
bonus or share incentive schemes including Sharesave. 
PART B   Annual Report on Remuneration
The following provides details of the Remuneration Policy 
which will be in operation for 2014/15 and that operated for 
the year ended 28 February 2014. Certain elements of the 
this report, as indicated, have been audited.
Part B-1 (Audited Information) Implementation 
of the Remuneration Policy for the year ending 
28 February 2015
Executive Directors
Basic salary
From 1 March 2014, the Group's employees generally, 
including the Executive Directors, received a pay increase 
of 3% reflecting the strong underlying performance of 
the business. From 1 March 2013 in respect of the previous 
year, increases for higher paid employees including 
the Executive Directors were limited to 0% subject to 
adjustments for increased responsibilities.
The basic salaries for the Executive Directors from 1 March 
2014 are as follows:
Pensions
In accordance with the policy, pension contributions will 
be set at 15% of basic salary for Nigel Newton and Wendy 
Pallot. No pension contributions will be made by the 
Company for Richard Charkin.
Other benefits
Benefits will continue to comprise of a car or car allowance 
(excluding Richard Charkin), medical cover, permanent 
health cover, life assurance and Company schemes offered 
to staff generally such as buying books for private use at the 
staff discount rate.
Annual bonus
For 2014/15, the maximum bonus potential will continue 
to be set at 100% of salary based on profit with 30% of 
the bonus paid subject to achieving further objectives 
including 10% on personal objectives and 20% on  
strategic objectives.
The Group Management Bonus scheme used in previous 
years for the Executive Directors will continue to be 
adopted for 2014/15. Under this scheme bonuses for the 
Executive Directors and approximately 40 managers are 
paid from a bonus pool determined by the Committee. The 
bonuses for the participants of the scheme are scaled back 
where the pool is not sufficient to pay maximum bonuses. 
The maximum bonus for each participant is capped 
and depends on them achieving their individual bonus 
objectives.
The pool is calculated as the excess of Adjusted Profits 
(before bonus) above a stretching target set by the 
Committee. No bonuses are paid if Adjusted Profits fall 
below the target.

1. As negotiated at the time of appointment, Richard Charkin's base salary includes a modest uplift in lieu of pension and car allowance.
2. Wendy Pallot was assigned responsibility for the Group's Information Technology from December 2012. Following a probationary period of six months to assess her 
performance, the assignment of responsibilities was made permanent. In view of the resulting increased responsibility, additional commitment required and her 
performance, the Committee approved an increase of  12,000 per annum to the basic salary of Wendy Pallot from 1 September 2013. The personal and strategic 
objectives for the annual cash bonus of Wendy Pallot in future years will include objectives relating to Bloomsbury's IT.

Long-term incentives
As a result of the current PSP (Bloomsbury 2005 
Performance Share Plan) reaching the end of its 10 year life, 
shareholder consent for a new plan, based on the existing 
arrangements but updated in a number of areas to comply 
with best practice (including the reduction of the threshold 
vesting level and introduction of claw-back), will be sought 
at the 2014 AGM. 
Reflecting market practice for a FTSE SmallCap company, 
the PSP individual annual award limits under the current 
PSP will, subject to shareholder approval, be reduced in the 
new PSP from 150% of salary to 100% of salary. Further, the 
exceptional limit of 300% of salary in the current PSP will be 
reduced to 150% of salary. 
The annual PSP awards to be granted in 2014 will be subject 
to the following targets:
   Absolute EPS (50%) - 25% of this part of an award will 
vest for annualised growth in EPS over the performance 
period of RPI +3% increasing pro-rata to 100% vesting 
for annualised growth in EPS over the performance 
period of RPI + 8%; and
   Relative TSR (50%) - the Company's TSR measured 
against the constituents of the FTSE SmallCap 
(excluding investment trusts). 25% of this part of an 
award will vest at median increasing pro-rata to 100% 
vesting at top quartile or higher. 
EPS and relative TSR are considered to be the most 
appropriate measures of long-term performance for 
the Group, in that they ensure Executive Directors are 
incentivised and rewarded for the earnings performance of 
the Group as well as returning value to shareholders.
The awards will be subject to claw-back provisions. 
Subject to the approval of the Remuneration Committee, 
the Executive Directors may participate in the Company's 
Sharesave scheme if operated during 2014/15.

Annual bonus
Bonuses, which are capped at 100% of salary, were awarded to the Executive Directors in respect of the year ended  
28 February 2014 at a rate of 17% of salary. This bonus award follows the Committee's assessment of performance against 
personal and strategic objectives and Adjusted Profits (before bonus) exceeding a target of  13 million.
Vesting of PSP awards
The PSP awards granted on 8 December 2011 are set to vest on 8 December 2014 based on EPS performance over the three 
years ended 28 February 2014 for 50% of awards and relative TSR over the three years from grant. As disclosed in previous 
annual reports, the performance condition for this award was as follows:

on the position as at 28 February 2014. For the purposes of calculating Single Figure values the estimated vesting of TSR awards is excluded on the basis that the 
performance conditions were not met within the Financial Year ended 28 February 2014.
Based on the above and for the purposes of calculating the Single Figure, estimated values for the PSP awards for the 
Executive Directors are as follows:

[1] The shareholding guideline was introduced during the year ended 28 February 2013 and can be found on the Company's website www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. 
The guideline requires that the Executive Director must retain shares vesting from the PSP awards net of tax until the shareholding guideline has been met. The 
number of shares needed to satisfy a shareholding is recalculated at the close of the next business day following the announcement of the full year results (the 
 Review Date'). The recalculation is based on the Executive Director's prevailing base salary and the closing mid market share price (165.25 pence) on the Review 
Date.
[2] The shareholdings shown are as at the date the Directors stood down from the Board being on 11 July 2013 for Sarah Jane Thomson and 29 August 2013 for 
Jeremy Wilson.
[3] Owned includes shares held directly by the Director and indirectly by a nominee on behalf of the Director where the Director has the beneficial interest. It includes 
the shares of the Director and of connected persons defined under the Model Code annexed to the UKLA Listing Rules.
There were no changes in the interests of any Director between 1 March 2014 and the date of this report.
No Director has or has had any interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction, contract or arrangement (excluding service 
agreements), which is or was unusual in its nature or conditions or significant to the business of the Group during the 
current or immediately preceding financial year.
The closing market price of an Ordinary Share at 28 February 2014 was 177.0p (2013: 104.0p) and the range of intra-day 
market prices from 1 March 2013 to 28 February 2014 was 104.0p to 185.0p (2013: 101.6p to 148.0p).
Bloomsbury operates an HMRC approved Sharesave scheme for which all UK employees are eligible to participate. The 
following Sharesave options granted to the Executive Directors were outstanding at the year ended.

Remuneration Committee
Responsibilities and activities of the Committee
The Committee determines the Remuneration Policy and annual remuneration plans for the Executive Directors for 
approval by the Board. In particular, the Committee approves for each Executive Director the basic salaries, pensions, other 
benefits, bonus awards and the awards made under Bloomsbury's Long Term Incentive Plan. The Committee approves all 
payments of bonus and the vesting of PSP awards before payments are made for each Executive Director. 
The Committee considers it is appropriate for the Executive Directors to determine the remuneration plans of senior 
management. In respect of employees below the level of the Board, the Committee approves the bonus pool from which 
bonuses are paid and approves the grant and vesting of all share incentives before payments are made.
Membership
For the year ended 28 February 2014 up until signing the Report the Committee has comprised three Non-Executive 
Directors as follows:
Director Appointed Resigned
Jill Jones (Chair of the Committee) 23 July 2013  
Sarah Jane Thomson (Chair of the Committee)   11 July 2013
Sir Anthony Salz 29 August 2013 -
Jeremy Wilson   29 August 2013
Ian Cormack   -
The Group Company Secretary, Michael Daykin FCIS FCA, acts as secretary to the Committee. Sarah Jane Thomson chaired 
the Committee from 28 May 2010 until her resignation on 11 July 2013. All meetings or business of the Committee were 
conducted during the year with two Independent Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman present.
The Committee met formally on 7 (seven) occasions during the year including 3 (three) occasions without the Executive 
Directors present and on four occasions with an Executive Director attending at the request of the Committee for specific 
items on the agenda. New Bridge Street attends Committee meetings where needed to provide technical support. The 
Committee chair has a standing item on the agenda at each main Board meeting, which provides the opportunity to 
update on and raise remuneration matters for discussion by the Board. Minutes of the Committee are circulated to the 
Board once they have been approved by the Committee.

Assistance to the Committee
During the year the Committee took advice from external remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street, which does not 
perform other services for and has no other connection with the Company (a statement to this effect is included on the 
Company's website, www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk). The Committee is free to choose its advisors and is satisfied that New Bridge 
Street continues to provide advice that is objective and independent. Fees paid to New Bridge Street for 2013/14 totalled 
 14,131.
The Committee received assistance from the Group Company Secretary and, where specifically requested by the 
Committee, the Chief Executive and Finance Director. The Committee has considered any feedback received from the 
major shareholders during the year as part of Bloomsbury's on-going investor relations programme and considers the 
reports and recommendations of shareholder representative bodies and corporate governance analysts.
