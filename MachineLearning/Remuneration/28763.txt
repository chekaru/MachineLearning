BLUEHEATH HOLDINGS PLC REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2005
REMUNERATION REPORT
Prior to the admission of Blueheath plc (the Company ) to the Alternative Investment Market, the
remuneration committee (the committee ) examined its remuneration policy for the executive
team of the company with its retained remuneration consultants, Halliwell Consulting.
Since Admission to the Alternative Investment Market, Halliwell Consulting have conducted a
further detailed review, and have produced a recommendation that, after consultation, the
remuneration committee has accepted.
Remuneration policy
The company wishes to attract and retain senior management of the highest quality. Accordingly,
its policy, in a competitive market, is to design remuneration packages which, through an
appropriate combination of basic salary and share options, reward senior managers fairly and
responsibly for their individual contributions.
The committee's overall policy is to provide competitive and potentially rewarding remuneration
packages which place particular emphasis on long term incentive pay.
Basic salary
The executives' current salaries are set at the lower quartile compared to a comparator group. It is
the intention of the committee that they should, over time, move to the median level.
Annual bonus
Bonuses are set at the median level compared to a comparator group. The committee sets robust
and challenging performance targets at the beginning of each financial year taking into account the
business plan for that year and general market conditions. At the end of the financial year the
committee assesses the degree to which they have been satisfied, any exceptional circumstances that
affected the annual bonus plan, if applicable, and the basis of any payments made to the Executives.
Benefits
The company does not offer benefits such as a company car allowance, personal medical insurance
and life assurance cover.
Pension
The company does not currently pay contributions into pension arrangements for the Executive
Directors.
Long term incentive plan
Since Admission to the Alternative Investment Market, the company has introduced a long-term
share incentive plan which provides executives with conditional rights to receive shares. The
principal conditions are continued employment during the three year holding period since the date
of grant; and the satisfaction of the series of performance conditions, the principal performance
condition being the company's comparative total shareholder return performance against the
companies constituting a comparator group. At the balance sheet date no options or shares had
been granted to any director under the Long Term Incentive Plan.
Non-executive directors' remuneration
Fees payable to non-executive are determined by the Board of Directors, within the limits set by the
Articles of Association. Job: 13343A-- Date: 05-05-05 Area: A1 Operator: MC Typesetter ID: DESIGN: ID Number: 0071 TCP No. 7 Time: 15:06 Rev: 0 Gal: 0013
