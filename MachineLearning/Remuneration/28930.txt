 The management resources committee
The management resources committee (MRC) comprises all the independent non-executive directors with the exception of the
Group chairman, Rob Margetts. Its members are G ran Lundberg (Chairman), Fabiola Arredondo (appointed November 2001),
Julie Baddeley, Matthew Miau (appointed January 2002), and Chris O'Donnell. Roberto Mendoza was appointed a non-executive
director in October 2002 and has become a member of the MRC. Until their retirement on 18 January 2002 Harry Groome and
Howard Macdonald had been members of the MRC. Whilst neither the Group chairman nor the chief executive are members of
the MRC they both attend the meetings by invitation but are not present when their personal remuneration is discussed and
reviewed. The Group human resources director, Rob Lourey, attends in an advisory capacity and acts as secretary.
Remuneration policy
The MRC sets the overall remuneration policy of The BOC Group and makes recommendations to the board on the framework 
of executive remuneration. It meets approximately six times a year. The terms of reference conform with best practice. The MRC
determines, on behalf of the board, the detailed terms of service of the executive directors and other members of the executive
management team including basic salary, performance-related bonus arrangements, benefits in kind, long-term incentives and pension
benefits. The MRC does not retain remuneration consultants but appoints professional external advisors as it sees fit. During the
year professional advice was sought from external consultants Deloitte & T ouche. These advisors did not provide any other services
to the Group. The MRC is also provided with information and data from national and international surveys on executive pay and
conditions such as those provided by T owers Perrin, Mercer Human Resources consultants, Watson Wyatt and Monks Partnership
Limited.
The MRC also reviews the remuneration of the Group chairman following a recommendation from the chief executive and
senior independent director, though the board as a whole determine the non-executive directors' fees.
The fees of the non-executive directors are set at a level which will attract individuals with the necessary experience and ability
to make a significant contribution to The BOC Group's affairs and are benchmarked with those fees paid by other UK listed
companies. Non-executive directors' fees will be increased from  30,000 to  37,000 per annum and the committee chair fees
increased from  5,000 to  8,000 per annum, effective 1 January 2003. These increases, after tax, will be used to acquire shares in 
the company which will be held by the non-executive directors for the remaining period of their term of office with the company.
BOC's remuneration policy for executive directors and other executive management is designed to attract and retain executives
of the highest calibre so that The BOC Group is managed successfully to the benefit of its stakeholders. In setting remuneration
levels the MRC takes into account the remuneration practices found in other UK listed companies of similar size, internationality
and complexity and seeks to benchmark its whole remuneration at about the median level for this group.
During the year the MRC carried out a review of executive remuneration packages and decided that a realignment was necessary
to support the company's business strategy to improve both earnings growth and capital efficiency and to ensure that the packages
were market competitive. In reaching its conclusions the MRC took the view that performance related remuneration should form a
substantial element of total remuneration thereby aligning the interests of directors with those of shareholders, which would be
reflected through share price growth and dividends. As such, a proposal will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting
to adopt new long-term incentive arrangements. These arrangements are intended to encourage innovation and value-added growth
and strengthen the link between short-term performance and sustainable improvement in shareholder value over the longer term.
The performance measures for the Long T erm Incentive Plan (LTIP) will be based one third on Earnings Per Share (EPS) before
exceptional items, one third on Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) before exceptional items and one third on the company's 
T otal Shareholder Return (TSR) performance relative to industry based comparator groups - that is, an index of FTSE based
manufacturing companies and a global industrial gases group. The performance measure for the Executive Share Option Scheme
(ESOS 2003) will be assessed on the growth in basic EPS before exceptional items as reported in the annual report and accounts.
The MRC consider these performance measures to be important drivers of sustainable improvement in shareholder value that focus
executives' attention and effort on profitable growth and capital efficiency in both the short and long term.
Details of the arrangements are summarised in the chairman's letter and explanatory notes to the Notice of the Annual 
General Meeting. The MRC believes that executives' interests in long-term share price performance is an important link to future
organisational performance. Additionally, the MRC encourages the executive management group to grow personal shareholdings in
the business over time. It is anticipated that each executive would build towards a shareholding equivalent in value to one year's
gross salary. The MRC believes that the vehicle of the long-term incentive package will facilitate the building of such a shareholding
over a period of time.
Remuneration components
Basic salary Salaries for executive directors and executive management board members are based on median market rates drawn
from external market data and take account of an executive's experience, responsibilities and performance. Performance is assessed
both from an individual and business perspective. Executive salaries are normally reviewed annually by the MRC. Remuneration for
those executives of businesses outside the UK is denominated in the local currency.
Benefits in kind Benefits in kind comprise company car benefits and membership of BOC's health care insurance scheme and,
where appropriate, directors on international assignment receive overseas allowances such as housing and children's education fees.
These allowances are on similar terms to those applying to other employees on the international assignment programme. Such
benefits are in line with those offered by peer group companies. Benefits in kind do not form part of pensionable earnings.
Report on remuneration
56 The BOC Group plc Report and accounts 2002 Variable compensation plan The executive directors and senior management participate in the variable compensation bonus
plan. The plan focuses on annual objectives and links individual performance with business plans. The financial targets for the
executive directors and other executive management board members are set on an annual basis by the MRC and performance
against these targets is reviewed by the MRC on a six monthly basis. The MRC considers that a six monthly review acts as a
significant incentive and is conducive to sustaining performance throughout the year. The targets are based on EPS before
exceptional items and ROCE before exceptional items at Group level. Bonuses are assessed two thirds on these financial targets
with the remaining third based on personal objectives derived from BOC's strategic priorities, including safety and growth initiatives.
Executives can be awarded an annual bonus of 80 per cent of salary for the achievement in full of both stretch financial targets and
their personal objectives. Bonuses in excess of 80 per cent of salary can be paid for exceptional financial performance. There is a
threshold performance level below which no bonus is paid.
The bonuses for the executive directors and other members of the executive management board are paid half yearly following
the MRC review. Details of the payments to directors are included in the directors' remuneration for the year.
Retirement benefits Pension arrangements for executive directors are in line with those of comparable executives in the
countries in which the directors are located.
In the UK, the BOC senior executive pension scheme is a funded, tax-approved, defined benefit pension arrangement. Where
necessary, the director's pensionable pay is limited by the  earnings cap' provisions of the Finance Act 1989. In such cases, the
company pays the director a salary supplement on earnings above the pensions cap to reflect the loss of pension coverage.
This supplement is recorded in the director's emoluments and is not taken into account in calculating bonuses or any other form 
of remuneration.
In the US, the BOC T op-Hat pension plan is an unfunded, non-tax-qualified, defined benefit pension arrangement.
Details of the individual directors' pension arrangements are shown on page 58.
Service contracts The company's policy is for all executive directors to have contracts of employment that terminate on the
attainment of retirement age. In order to mitigate its liability on early termination, the company's policy is that it should be able to
terminate such contracts on no more than 12 months' notice, and that payments on termination are restricted to the value of
salary, and certain benefits, for the notice period.
All current executive directors have service contracts which are summarised on page 58.
The non-executive directors do not have contracts of service. They do not participate in the Group's variable compensation
arrangements, its long-term incentive arrangements or its pension arrangements, nor do they receive any benefits in kind.
Share option plans Executive directors and other eligible employees participate in The BOC Group Executive Share Option
Scheme (ESOS) which was introduced in 1995. The scheme uses newly issued and purchased shares. The MRC sets out the
guidelines for the awards each year. The guidelines take account of personal performance and local market practice. Options are
granted at the full market value of the company's shares at the time of grant and are exercisable between three and ten years from
the date of grant subject to the performance condition, set by the MRC, being met. The options vest when the company's EPS
growth (before exceptional items) is equal to, or exceeds, the growth in the Retail Prices Index (RPI) by three per cent per annum
over any three year performance period. The MRC considers this performance condition to be a challenging performance hurdle
when compared to the company's ten year EPS compound annual growth rate (before exceptional items) of around four per cent.
The performance measure is assessed annually and is based on basic EPS before exceptional items as reported in the annual report.
In countries where it is not appropriate to grant share options, grants are made as share appreciation rights and, on exercise, the
gain is delivered in cash. The rules for such grants are similar to those for share options. Subject to shareholder approval of the
proposed ESOS 2003 no further options will be granted under this scheme.
Prior to 1995 options were granted to executive directors under the Senior Executive Share Option Scheme, the 1994 Executive
Option Scheme and the Executive Share Purchase Plan. In line with market practice at that time the vesting of these awards is not
subject to performance conditions. UK based directors are also eligible to participate in the Inland Revenue approved BOC Savings
Related Share Option Scheme which is open to all UK employees with one year's service or more.

BOC FTSE 100
This graph shows BOC's TSR performance compared to the
FTSE 100 index TSR over the last five years. TSR is defined
as share price growth plus reinvested dividends. This provides
a basis for comparison as a relevant equity index in which
BOC is a constituent member. The company believes that
other indices and time periods display aspects of relative
performance on a more appropriate basis (see Group
chairman's statement and LTIP proposals). Other specific arrangements 
Share award plan The awards made in June 2000 under the share award plan which was introduced as an immediate retention
programme following the lapse of the offer from Air Liquide and Air Products vested in June 2002. Under the plan the shares
awarded vested after two years provided a performance condition was met. The performance condition required EPS growth before
exceptional items to equal, or exceed, the growth in the RPI by three per cent per annum over a two year period. Details of awards
made to directors prior to their appointment to the board and which vested during the year are shown on page 63. No further
awards will be made under the plan.
Share incentive unit plan Between 1989 and 1995 awards were made to executives under an incentive arrangement linked to
the growth in the company's share price. No awards have been made under the plan since 1995. The final payment under the plan
matured in November 2002.
Details of directors' individual remuneration, share options and share awards, share incentive units and share holdings are given 
on pages 59 to 63.
Individual pension arrangements 
Mr Grant's pension is provided for under the US cash balance retirement plan and the US T op-Hat pension plan, which, in
combination, entitle Mr Grant to a lump sum benefit on retirement at age 65 equivalent to a pension of approximately 72 per cent
of final base salary. In accordance with local competitive practices existing in his country of operation prior to his appointment as a
director, Mr Grant's bonus is pensionable.
Mr Isaac's pension to his contractual retirement age is being funded in the UK through a combination of a tax-approved personal
pension plan and a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme, which is underpinned by a guarantee for which provision will be
made in the accounts if appropriate.
Mr M dori's pension benefits are funded under the UK senior executive pension scheme on earnings up to the  pension cap'
imposed by the Finance Act 1989. On retirement at age 60, he will be entitled to a pension of 57.5 per cent of capped earnings.
In addition, he has a vested deferred benefit, under the US cash balance retirement plan, which he will be entitled to take as a lump
sum on retirement at age 60.
Dr Rajagopal's pension benefits are funded under the UK senior executive pension scheme. On retirement at age 60, he will be
entitled to a pension of two thirds of his final 12 months' salary.
Mr Walsh's pension is provided for under the US cash balance retirement plan and the US T op-Hat pension plan, which, in
combination, entitle Mr Walsh to a lump sum benefit on retirement at age 65 equivalent to a pension of approximately 60 per cent
of final base salary. In accordance with local competitive practices existing in his country of operation prior to his appointment as a
director, Mr Walsh's bonus is pensionable.
Further details of the pension plans for executive directors are given on page 60.

1. The amounts shown as converted to cash in the year include interest earned from the date of conversion.
The share incentive unit plan provides for cash payments to executives based on increases in the share price over a period of up 
to eight years from the time of grant. Grants under the plan were made between 1989 and 1995 to supplement or substitute for
grants under the share option schemes. No grants have been made since 1995.
Executives may elect to convert share incentive units to cash provided that the units have been held for three years. The fixed
cash sum, determined by reference to the share price on the date of election over and above the original grant price, will earn
interest at one per cent above the HSBC base rate. A full cash payment can only be received by an executive after eight years but
limited early payments may be made in certain circumstances between the fourth and eighth years, at the discretion of the
management resources committee. The plan includes significant forfeiture penalties in the event that an executive leaves the
company other than on retirement before the expiration of the eight year period.
On normal retirement, or earlier at the discretion of the management resources committee, an executive will normally continue
to participate in the scheme so long as he observes a non-compete covenant in favour of the company. Full payment will be made 
at the eighth anniversary or earlier at the discretion of the management resources committee.
Former directors were granted their share incentive units when they were executive directors of the company.
