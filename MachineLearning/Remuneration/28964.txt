 The remuneration committee
The remuneration committee comprises, with the exception of the Group chairman, Rob Margetts, all the
independent non-executive directors namely Julie Baddeley (chairman), Fabiola Arredondo, Andrew Bonfield
(appointed July 2003), Roberto Mendoza (appointed October 2002), Matthew Miau and Sir Christopher O'Donnell.
G ran Lundberg had been the chairman of the remuneration committee until his retirement on 4 March 2003.
Whilst neither the Group chairman nor the chief executive are members of the remuneration committee they both
attend the meetings by invitation but are not present when their personal remuneration is discussed and reviewed.
The human resources director acts as secretary to the committee and provides it with information and data from
national and international surveys. In addition, during the year the remuneration committee appointed T owers Perrin
to review the remuneration arrangements for senior executives. No other services are provided by this adviser .
The remuneration committee sets the overall remuneration policy of the Group and makes recommendations
to the board on the framework of executive remuneration. It meets six times a year . Individual member attendance at
the meetings is shown on page 53. The terms of reference are reviewed annually to ensure that they conform with
best practice. Specifically , the remuneration committee determines, on behalf of the board, the detailed terms of
service of the executive directors and other members of the executive management team including basic salary ,
performance related bonus arrangements, benefits in kind, long-term incentives and pension benefits. The
remuneration committee also reviews the remuneration of the chairman, following a recommendation from the chief
executive and the senior independent director . The board as a whole determines the non-executive directors' fees.
Remuneration policy
BOC's remuneration policy for executive directors and other executive management is designed to attract and retain
executives of the highest calibre so that the Group is managed successfully to the benefit of its stakeholders. In setting
remuneration levels the remuneration committee takes into account the remuneration practices found in other UK-
listed companies of similar size, internationality and complexity and seeks to benchmark executive remuneration at
about the median level for this group.
During 2002 the remuneration committee reviewed the executive remuneration packages and decided that 
a realignment was necessary to support the company's business strategy to improve both earnings growth and 
capital efficiency and to ensure that the packages were market competitive. T o this end, a proposal to adopt new 
long-term incentive arrangements was put to shareholders and approved at the 2003 Annual General Meeting.
These arrangements comprise a long-term incentive plan and an executive share option scheme. They are intended
to encourage innovation and value-added growth and strengthen the link between short-term performance and
sustainable improvement in shareholder value over the longer term. It is the view of the remuneration committee
that performance-related remuneration should form a substantial element of total remuneration. As such, these
arrangements together with the variable compensation plan, which is a performance related cash plan, form the
variable elements of executive remuneration. It is expected that the achievement of  on target'performance of 
these variable elements will amount to about 60 per cent of total executive remuneration.
No changes to the framework of executive remuneration are proposed for 2004. The remuneration
committee will, however , review the policy on a regular basis and make any amendments it deems appropriate to
ensure that it meets the objectives of recruiting, retaining and motivating high performing individuals and ensuring 
that the Group is market competitive.
Remuneration components 
Basic salary Salaries for executive directors and executive management board members are based on median
market rates drawn from two external market data sources and take account of an executive's experience,
responsibilities and performance. Performance is assessed both from an individual and business perspective.
Executive salaries are normally reviewed annually by the remuneration committee. Remuneration for those
executives of businesses outside the UK is denominated in the local currency .
Benefits in kind Benefits in kind comprise company car benefits and membership of BOC's health care insurance
scheme. Where appropriate, directors on international assignment receive overseas allowances such as housing 
and children's education fees. These allowances are on similar terms to those applying to other employees on the
international programme. Such benefits are in line with those offered by peer group companies. Benefits in kind do
not form part of pensionable earnings.
Variable compensation plan The executive directors and senior management participate in the variable
compensation bonus plan. The plan focuses on annual objectives and links individual performance with business plans.
The financial targets for the executive directors and other executive management board members are set on an
annual basis by the remuneration committee and performance against these targets is reviewed by the remuneration
committee on a six-monthly basis. The remuneration committee considers that a six-monthly review acts as a
significant incentive and is conducive to sustaining performance throughout the year . The financial targets are based
equally on adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and adjusted return on capital employed (ROCE) at Group level.
Adjusted means excluding exceptional items. Bonuses are assessed two-thirds on these financial targets with the
remaining third based on personal objectives derived from BOC's strategic priorities, including safety and growth
initiatives. During 2002 the remuneration committee reviewed the plan and agreed the maximum bonus payable for
the achievement of financial and personal objectives would be 80 per cent of salary . There is a threshold performance
level below which no bonus is paid.
The bonuses for the executive directors and other members of the executive management board are paid 
half yearly following the remuneration committee review. Details of the payments to directors are included in the
directors'remuneration for the year on page 64.
Report on remuneration
60 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Current long-term incentive arrangements 
Long-T erm Incentive Plan (L TIP) Executive directors, members of the executive management board and a number
of other key executives selected from the company's global operations participate in the L TIP . The remuneration
committee has the discretion to grant awards up to a maximum of two times salary . The award made in February
2003 to the chief executive was based on 1 .5 times salary and for other board directors one times salary . There are
three performance conditions:total shareholder return (TSR), adjusted earning per share (EPS) and adjusted return
on capital employed (ROCE). Up to one third of the award could vest in respect of each performance condition.
The TSR performance condition compares BOC's TSR performance with two separate comparator groups, a
UK comparator group comprising 31 industrial and manufacturing companies and a global industrial gases group of
six leading companies as follows:
UK group
Aggregate Industries BPB Invensys Scottish & Southern Energy
AMEC Centrica Johnson Matthey Scottish Power
Anglo American Corus Group Kelda Group Severn T rent
AWG FKI National Grid T ransco Shell T ransport & T rading
BAE Systems Hanson Pilkington Smiths Group
BG Group IMI Rio Tinto T omkins
BHP Billiton ICI RMC Group United Utilities
BP International Power Rolls-Royce
When determining BOC's performance relative to the global gases group, the TSR for BOC and the comparator
companies will be amended (amended TSR) so that it reflects the excess (or shortfall) in returns relative to the local
stockmarket index where each company has its primary listing. The nationality and the local stockmarket index that 
will be used to calculate the amended TSR for each company is shown in parentheses below.
Global gases group
Airgas (US - S&P 500 Index)
Air Liquide (France - CAC 40 Index)
Air Products & Chemicals (US - S&P 500 Index)
Linde (Germany - DAX 30 Index)
Nippon Sanso (Japan - NIKKEI 225 Index)
Praxair (US - S&P 500 Index)
The BOC Group (UK - FTSE 100 Index)
For the awards made in 2003 the target set by the remuneration committee is such that if the company's TSR position
measured over a three year period is median in respect of both comparator groups, then 40 per cent of the shares in
respect of the TSR part of the award will vest. If the company's TSR position is upper quartile all of the shares in
respect of the TSR part of the award will vest. If the TSR performance is between the median and upper quartile a
proportion of between 40 per cent and all of the shares in respect of the TSR part of the award will vest. If the
company's TSR position is below the median for both comparator groups the TSR part of the award will lapse.
The adjusted EPS performance condition is based on the company's EPS before exceptional items relative to
three year targets on a sliding performance scale. For the award made in 2003 the target set by the remuneration
committee requires a five per cent per annum growth rate over three years for minimum vesting. If this is achieved,
40 per cent of the shares in respect of the EPS part of the award will vest. All of the shares in respect of the EPS part of
the award will vest if the company achieves a ten per cent per annum growth rate over three years. If the growth rate is
between five per cent and ten per cent a proportion of between 40 per cent and all of the shares in respect of the EPS
part of the award will vest. If the growth rate is less than five per cent per annum over the three year period the EPS part
of the award will lapse.
The adjusted ROCE performance condition is based on the company's ROCE before exceptional items relative
to three year targets on a sliding performance scale. The minimum target set by the remuneration committee for
awards in 2003 is 13 per cent at the end of the three year performance period. If this is achieved 40 per cent of the
shares in respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest. All of the shares in respect of the ROCE part of the award
will vest if the company achieves a ROCE of 14.5 per cent. If the ROCE performance is between 13 per cent and 14.5
per cent a proportion of between 40 per cent and all of the shares in respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest.
If the ROCE is less than 13 per cent the ROCE part of the award will lapse.
In setting three performance conditions for the L TIP award, the remuneration committee took the view that
these were the most important measures that drive or measure sustainable improvements in shareholder value - 
the TSR performance condition measures comparative performance while EPS and ROCE reflect a core part of the
company's business strategy , which is to improve both earnings growth and capital efficiency .
Executive Share Option Scheme 2003 (ESOS 2003) Executive directors, members of the executive management
board and other selected middle and senior management throughout the company's global operations participate 
in the ESOS 2003. The remuneration committee have the discretion to grant awards up to a maximum of two 
times salary . The awards made in February 2003 to the chief executive and other members of the board were based
on 1 .75 times salary . The performance condition set for the ESOS 2003 by the remuneration committee is that the
growth in the adjusted EPS over a three year performance period must be equal to or greater than the growth in the
UK retail prices index (RPI) plus three per cent per annum over the three year performance period. The performance
is assessed on the company's published results. If the performance condition is satisfied at the end of the performance
period then the awards would be exercisable in full. In the event that the performance condition is not satisfied over
61 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Report on remuneration continued
62 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
the original three year period then the remuneration committee has the discretion to re-test performance after five
years, but only where the remuneration committee believes the extension to be a fair and reasonable basis for
assessing the sustained underlying performance of the company . In line with current corporate governance best
practice there is no rolling re-testing of performance. The remuneration committee considers this performance
condition to be a challenging performance hurdle when compared to the company's adjusted EPS compound annual
growth rate over the last ten years of around four per cent.
Awards under the L TIP and ESOS 2003 may be satisfied in cash or other assets, for example, where it is
necessary for legal or tax reasons. The amount to be paid will, in the case of share options, be equal to the
participants gain on the exercise of the share option. Also, the remuneration committee may decide, prior to grant,
that an award shall be expressed to be a right to acquire a cash sum rather than shares. This type of award, known as
a phantom award, will normally only be granted to participants in jurisdictions where, because of local security laws
or exchange control provisions, it is difficult to issue or transfer shares to employees. The L TIP and ESOS 2003 awards
may be satisfied by using existing shares purchased in the market through The BOC Group plc Employee Share T rust
or by issuing new shares.
Awards under the L TIP and ESOS 2003 are not pensionable.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme UK based directors are eligible to participate in the BOC Savings Related
Share Option Scheme. The scheme is approved by the Inland Revenue and it is open to all UK employees with 
one year's service or more.
Former long-term incentive arrangements
Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 The last grant of options to the executive directors and members of the
executive management board took place in February 2002 and the last award to other Group employees took place
in December 2002. No further awards will be made under this scheme. The options vest when the company's
adjusted EPS growth is equal to, or exceeds, the growth in the retail prices index (RPI) by three per cent per annum
over any three year performance period.
Senior Executive Share Option Scheme,1994 Executive Share Option Scheme,Executive Share Purchase Plan
The last grants under these schemes took place in November 1994, February 1994 and August 1994 respectively .
In line with market practice at the time when these schemes were introduced the vesting of these awards was not
subject to performance conditions.
Share Incentive Unit Plan Between 1989 and 1995 awards were made to executives under an incentive
arrangement linked to the growth in the company's share price. No awards have been made under the plan 
since 1995. The final payment was made in November 2002.
Retirement benefits 
Pension arrangements for executive directors are in line with those of comparable executives in the countries in
which the directors are located.
In the UK, the BOC Senior Executive Pension Scheme is a funded, tax-approved, defined benefit pension
arrangement. Where necessary , the director's pensionable pay is limited by the  earnings cap'provisions of the
Finance Act 1989. In such cases, the company pays the director a salary supplement on earnings above the earnings
cap to reflect the loss of pension coverage. This supplement is recorded in the director's emoluments and is not 
taken into account in calculating bonuses or any other form of remuneration.
BOC closed its UK defined benefit pension arrangements to all new employees on 30 June 2003. Pension
arrangements for new employees will be provided for under a defined contribution Retirement Savings Plan. The
company will make contributions to the plan equal to two times the employee's core contributions which can be
three, four or five per cent of salary .
In the US, the BOC T op-Hat Pension Plan is an unfunded, non-tax-qualified, defined benefit pension arrangement.
In Australia, the BOC Gases Superannuation Fund is a defined contribution arrangement underpinned by a defined
benefit guarantee for long-serving employees who were members under a prior benefit structure.
Shareholding guidelines 
The remuneration committee encourages executive management to grow personal shareholding in the 
business over time. It is anticipated that each executive would build towards a shareholding of one times salary .
The remuneration committee believes that the vehicle of the long-term incentive arrangements will facilitate the
building of such a shareholding over a period of time.
Details of directors'individual remuneration, share options, L TIP awards, share incentive units and share holdings
are given on pages 64 to 68. As set out in the remuneration policy statement performance related remuneration is
expected to amount to about 60 per cent for each of the executive directors. The performance conditions for each
current and former share option and long-term incentive plan are set out above.
Non-executive directors 
Non-executive directors are generally appointed for an initial period to the next Annual General Meeting and subject
to reappointment at the meeting, for a further three year term. Subsequent reappointment is with the agreement of
the board and approval of shareholders. The fees are set at a level which will attract individuals with the necessary
experience and ability to make a significant contribution to the Group's affairs. The responsibilities of, and the time
commitment expected from, non-executive directors have increased in recent times and fees paid to non-executives
are increasing to reflect this. As a result, from 1 January 2004 the non-executive directors' fees will increase from
 37,000 to  40,000 per annum,  10,000 of which, less tax, will be invested in BOC shares. The fees for chairing a  committee will increase from  8,000 to  10,000 per annum,  5,000 of which, less tax, will be invested in BOC
shares. The fee for the chairman, Rob Margetts, is set at  225,000.
The non-executive directors do not have contracts of service nor do they participate in the Group's variable
compensation arrangements, its long-term incentive arrangements or its pension arrangements, nor do they receive
any benefits in kind.
The graph above has been included to meet the requirement set out in the Directors'Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002. It shows BOC's TSR performance, assuming dividends are reinvested, compared with all FTSE 100
companies. This has been chosen because it provides a basis for comparison against companies in a relevant, broad
based equity index of which BOC is a constituent member . The remuneration committee decided that other
comparator groups were more appropriate as performance measurement for the L TIP . A graph showing BOC's 
TSR performance compared with the six major gases companies relative to respective local indices, which is one of
the comparator groups chosen for the L TIP , is shown in the chairman's statement on page 5.
Service contracts
The company's policy is for all executive directors to have contracts of employment that terminate on the attainment
of retirement age. In order to mitigate its liability on early termination, the company's policy is that it should be able to
terminate such contracts on no more than 12 months'notice, and that payments on termination are restricted to the
value of salary , car benefit and bonus entitlement (calculated on the basis of the average of actual payments over the
preceding two years) for the unexpired portion of the notice period. Pension provisions on termination are detailed
in the individual service contracts below.
Individual service contracts Mr Bevan has a contract dated 5 December 2002 that can be terminated by the
company on 12 months'notice. In the event of early termination, the contract provides for the payment of

Excess retirement benefits
No person who has served as a director at any time during the financial year has received retirement benefits in
excess of those to which he or she was entitled on the date that the benefits first became payable.
Compensation for past director
Mr Grant, former chief executive Process Gas Solutions, had a contract dated 1 May 1999. The contract could be
terminated by the company on two years'notice, and provided for the payment of the value of base salary for the
unexpired portion of the notice period. Additionally , the contract provided for the addition of Mr Grant's notice
period to his pensionable service in the calculation of his pension entitlement.
Mr Grant resigned as a director on 31 December 2002 and he left the company on 30 June 2003. His termination
entitlements were mitigated by an agreement that his contractual notice period would be treated as expiring on 
30 September 2004. He accordingly received a payment of  448,000, representing salary and compensation for
benefits in respect of the agreed 15-month notice period. Mr Grant was also entitled to purchase his company car for a
nominal amount. In addition, Mr Grant's benefit in the US top-hat pension plan was credited with 15 additional months
of pensionable service in respect of his notional notice period. The top-hat pension plan was also adjusted to meet 
Mr Grant's accrued entitlement. Additionally , he received the sum of  13,400 being the equivalent of the company's
contribution which would have been credited to Mr Grant's US cash balance retirement plan during the period of his
agreed notice period. These amounts are disclosed on page 64 as  T ermination payments'and have been charged
against profit in 2003.
Details of Mr Grant's share options are given on page 67, and details of his pension entitlements are given on
page 68.
