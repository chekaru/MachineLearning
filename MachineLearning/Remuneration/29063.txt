 28 The Body Shop International PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2004
Remuneration Report
Remuneration and Nominations Committee
The Remuneration and Nominations Committee (the Committee )
consisted of four non-executive Directors, Jack Keenan (Chairman),
Irene Miller, Ronald de Waal and Gordon Roddick, who served
throughout the period covered by this report. Gordon Roddick 
ceased to be a member of the Committee on 28 February 2004.
The Committee is responsible for recommending new appointments
to the Board and approves the total remuneration and employment
terms of all senior executives in the Group, the granting of share
options and the targets in the Performance Related Reward Scheme.
The members of the Committee have no personal financial
interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided,
no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships,
other than as noted on page 26 and no day-to-day involvement in
running the business.
The Committee consulted the Executive Chairman, Chief
Executive Officer and Director of Human Resources of the Company
in arriving at its decisions, except when the remuneration of these
executives was being considered.
The Committee has been advised by Towers Perrin who have
also provided general advice to the Committee and the Company on
executive remuneration, Share Options and the Performance Related
Reward Scheme.
Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors
The remuneration policy for Executive Directors and the remaining
members of the executive committee is designed to attract and
retain the management skills necessary to develop the Company's
international business. The Remuneration Policy set out below is
therefore applied consistently across that group of executives and
has applied throughout the year to 28 February 2004 and it is
currently intended to apply a similar policy in future years.
The Company aims to provide total remuneration arrangements
that are appropriate to the nature of the business. Total remuneration
is linked to both individual and Company performance, with the use
of share options designed to encourage long-term commitment to
the Company's success. This approach reflects the general basis for
remuneration of all executives and managers within the Company.
Reviews have been carried out, supported by independent
advice, to ensure that the range and level of remuneration continue
to match current market rates. Compensation levels and packages
are compared with those of executives with similar skills and
experience, and with companies which can be compared to
The Body Shop in terms of size, business sector, diversity and
complexity of business, geographical spread of business or growth
profile. Some Executive Directors have been recruited from
international markets and, in these cases, the basic salaries reflect
remuneration levels in the Executive Directors' home countries.
In addition to basic salary, the remuneration package of
Executive Directors includes an annual Performance Related Reward
Scheme, pension benefits, participation in Share Option schemes,
and an element of non-cash benefits.
Basic Salary
It is the Company's policy to ensure that basic salaries are
appropriate and competitive for the responsibilities involved.
The Company uses information from independent sources on the
rates of salary for similar jobs. The basic salary for each Director 
for the year ended 28 February 2004 is shown in the Directors'
Emoluments table set out in this report. The policy of the Company 
is to review their basic salary annually, or otherwise on promotion 
or change of responsibility, taking into account competitive market
information and individual performance
Under an agreement entered into on 10 August 2001, before 
he became Executive Chairman of the Company, Adrian Bellamy also
received a fee of US$1,000,000 per annum for a two year period
which expired on 9 August 2003 in respect of consultancy services.
Performance Related Reward Scheme
The Company's Performance Related Reward Scheme (PRRS ) 
is designed to provide the Executive Directors with an incentive to
achieve short-term performance targets. Bonus payments are non-
pensionable and are subject to approval by the Committee.
In the year ended 28 February 2004 an annual cash bonus
could be earned for performance above a minimum target, with 
60% (50% in the case of Alastair Murray) of basic salary payable 
if the Director achieved a combination of performance targets and
business and personal objectives and a maximum of 100% of basic
salary was payable if the highest performance targets were met.
Any bonus depended upon the Group achieving a minimum profit
target. Similar arrangements are in place for the year to 26 February
2005. For the year ended 28 February 2004 the Group exceeded the
minimum target relating to pre-tax profit and the bonuses are set out
in the Directors' Emoluments table.
As a result of the operation of the PRRS up to 50% of each
Executive Director's total annual remuneration (disregarding benefits
and pension contributions) can be performance related if the highest
performance targets are met. The performance element is further
enhanced if Executive Directors are able to exercise their share
options.
Share Option Schemes
The Company believes that share ownership by Directors, executives
and other managers strengthens the link between the personal
interests of those individuals and those of shareholders. Since 1984, 29 The Body Shop International PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2004
The Body Shop has encouraged long-term share ownership through
widespread use of share options. The latest share option schemes
(the 2002 Schemes ) were introduced during 2002.
Options are granted to Executive Directors and other executives
as an incentive to achieve long term success for the Company.
The Committee approves all grants of share options. The current
policy of the Committee on the operation of the 2002 Schemes is 
to make regular annual grants over the ten-year life of the scheme
with annual grants over shares worth up to two times annual salary.
Exceptionally, executive recruitment needs and general business
strategy may necessitate larger block grants in some years.
The Committee will normally restrict the total cumulative options
outstanding to any individual to no more than four times annual
salary. Options will vest only if the growth in the Company's
normalised earnings per share over the three, four or five financial
years (commencing with the year current at the date of grant)
exceeds the growth in the Retail Price Index during the same period
by at least three percentage points per annum. This form of
performance test was adopted in 1995 and has been selected to
ensure that options will not vest unless the underlying financial
performance of the Company is satisfactory. It is not currently
proposed to change the individual limits or performance targets
under the 2002 Schemes.
The Company operates a Savings Related Share Option Scheme
which is open to all UK employees including Executive Directors.
Options are granted at 80% of market value at the date of the
invitation to participate and the maximum that can be saved each
month is limited to  250.
Details of the options held by each Director and the
performance condition applicable to each grant are set out in the
section headed Directors' Share Options. This includes details of 
the performance conditions applicable to Share Options outstanding
under the previous 1995 scheme.
Pension
Executive Directors (other than Adrian Bellamy) are entitled to
Company pension contributions at a rate of 12% of basic salary.
These contributions can be paid into the Company's Inland Revenue
approved money purchase scheme or into another similar pension
scheme.
Service Contracts
All the Executive Directors have one year rolling service contracts
which can be terminated by either the Company or the Executive
Director giving not less than 12 months notice and which ultimately
expire when they reach retirement age (either 60 or 65). Under the
service contracts, in the event that the Company requires the
executive to leave before the expiry of the notice period, it is obliged
to pay the basic salary for any unexpired period of notice that is not
worked, together with associated benefits including pension
contributions. In addition all the Executive Directors are entitled to
the pro rata proportion of the PRRS earned in a year up to the date
their employment ends. The information in respect of each Director
with a service contract is as follows:
Adrian Bellamy
Contract date: 12 June 2002
Unexpired term: Age 65 or 12 months' notice
Peter Saunders
Contract date: 3 June 2002
Unexpired term: Age 60 or 12 months' notice
Alastair Murray
Contract date: 21 December 1998
Unexpired term: Age 60 or 12 months' notice
Ceased to be a Director on 13 June 2003
Taxable Benefits
In the relevant year, private medical insurance has been provided 
for all Executive Directors other than Adrian Bellamy, and moving
expenses and a car allowance for Peter Saunders.
Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors initially serve a term expiring at the Annual
General Meeting at which they first come up for re-election on a
rotational basis (which cannot exceed three years after the first
Annual General Meeting following their appointment). Thereafter,
unless the Director has indicated a desire for a shorter term, they
will serve until they come up for re-election at an Annual General
Meeting again. They do not normally have contracts of service, are
not eligible for pension scheme membership, and do not participate
in the Group's share option schemes or the PRRS. Under the
Company's Articles of Association, Directors are entitled to be paid
as combined fees in each year a sum not exceeding  200,000.
Having regard to the additional duties increasingly required of 
Non-Executive Directors and the possibility that their numbers may
increase, it is proposed to amend this limit to  500,000 at the
Extraordinary General Meeting being held after this year's Annual
General Meeting. In addition they are entitled to reimbursement of
out-of-pocket travel and accommodation costs in connection with the
performance of their duties. 30 The Body Shop International PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2004
Remuneration Report continued
Based on the principles set out above the Non-Executive
Directors' current terms will expire at the Annual General Meeting
held in the following years:
Dame Anita Roddick 2004
Gordon Roddick 2006
Jack Keenan 2006
Ronald de Waal 2006
Irene Miller 2004
Remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by 
the Executive Chairman and Executive Directors, on the basis of
independent advice on current fee levels in similar businesses.
Supplementary fees may be paid for devoting additional time and
expertise for the benefit of the Group. For the year ended 28
February 2004 the Non-Executive Directors were paid an annual fee
of  30,000 with Irene Miller and Jack Keenan receiving an additional
 5,000, increased to  10,000 from 12 November 2003, as chair of
Board committees.
In addition to the fees paid to Dame Anita Roddick as a Non-
Executive Director, Anita Roddick Publications Ltd (ARP ) provides
the consultancy services of Dame Anita Roddick under an agreement
commencing 13 March 2002 for a period of 2 years and thereafter
for successive periods of 12 months unless either the Company or
ARP gives notice to end the agreement no less than 30 days prior 
to the end of any period. The annual fee payable is  195,000.
The contract has been extended to 13 March 2005. The maximum
compensation that could be payable, in certain restricted
circumstances, if the contract was terminated before the end 
of its term, would be the balance of the fee to the end of its term.
Performance Graph
Set out below is a graph covering the last five financial years
comparing the cumulative total shareholder return (TSR ) from
investing in the Company's ordinary shares against a similar
investment in a block of shares comprising the General Retailers'
Index. As the Company is a member of that Index it is considered 
the most appropriate comparative index for the purposes of the
performance graph but for other purposes, such as performance
conditions for share options, there may be other more appropriate
indices and measures given the nature of the business.
Directors' Share Interests
The Directors who held office during the year had the following
