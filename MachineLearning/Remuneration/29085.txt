 29 The Body Shop International PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2005
Remuneration Report
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee ) consists of three
independent Non-Executive Directors: Jack Keenan (Chairman),
Irene Miller and Ronald de Waal. The Committee approves the total
remuneration and employment terms of all senior executives in the
Group including both annual and long-term incentive schemes.
The members of the Committee have no personal financial
interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided,
no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships,
and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee consults the Executive Chairman, Chief
Executive Officer and Director of Human Resources of the Company
in arriving at its decisions, except when the remuneration of these
executives is being considered.
The Committee has been advised by Towers Perrin, who have
also provided general advice to the Committee and the Company 
on executive remuneration, including annual and long-term 
incentive schemes.
Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors
The Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and members 
of the Executive Committee is designed to attract and retain the
management skills necessary to develop the Company's
international business. The Remuneration Policy set out below is
applied consistently across the group of executives and has applied
throughout the year to 26 February 2005. It is intended that a
similar policy will be applied in future years.
The Company aims to provide total remuneration arrangements
that are appropriate to the nature of the business. Total
remuneration is linked to both individual and Company performance,
with the use of share options designed to encourage long-term
commitment to the Company's success. This approach reflects the
general basis for remuneration of all executives and managers
within the Company.
Reviews have been carried out, supported by independent
advice, to ensure that the range and level of remuneration continue
to match current market rates. Compensation levels and packages
are compared with those of executives with similar skills and
experience, and with companies which can be compared to 
The Body Shop in terms of size, business sector, diversity and
complexity of business, geographical spread of business or growth
profile. Some Executive Directors have been recruited from
international markets and, in these cases, the basic salaries reflect
remuneration levels in the Executive Directors' home countries.
In addition to basic salary, the remuneration package of
Executive Directors includes an annual incentive scheme, pension
benefits, participation in share schemes, and an element of 
non-cash benefits.
Basic Salary
It is the Company's policy to ensure that basic salaries are
appropriate and competitive for the responsibilities involved.
The Company uses information from independent sources on the
rates of salary for similar jobs. The basic salary for each Director 
for the year ended 26 February 2005 is shown in the Directors'
Emoluments table set out in this report. The policy of the Company
is to review their basic salary annually, or otherwise on promotion 
or change of responsibility, taking into account competitive market
information and individual performance.
Annual Incentive Scheme
The Company's Annual Incentive Scheme is designed to provide 
the Executive Directors with an incentive to achieve short-term
performance targets. Bonus payments are non-pensionable and 
are subject to approval by the Committee.
The bonus arrangements in place for both the year under
review and the current year enable Executive Directors to earn 
an annual cash bonus for performance above a minimum target,
with a maximum of 100% of basic salary payable if the highest
performance targets are met. Any bonus depends upon the Group
achieving a minimum profit target. The Group did not meet its
minimum target relating to pre-tax profit in the year ended 
26 February 2005 and no bonuses are payable for the year 
under review.
As a result of the operation of the Annual Incentive Scheme,
up to 50% of each Executive Director's total annual remuneration
(disregarding benefits and pension contributions) can be
performance related if the highest performance targets are met.
The performance element is further enhanced if Executive Directors
are able to exercise their rights under share schemes.
Share Schemes
The Company believes that share ownership by Directors,
executives and other managers strengthens the link between the
personal interests of those individuals and those of shareholders.
Since 1984, The Body Shop has encouraged long-term share
ownership through widespread use of share options. The most
recent share option schemes (the 2002 Schemes ) were
introduced during 2002. It is proposed to introduce a new
Performance Share Scheme at an EGM to be held immediately 
after the AGM on Friday 17 June 2005.
Options are granted to Executive Directors and other 
executives as an incentive to achieve long-term success for the
Company. The Committee approves all grants of share options.
The Committee's policy on the operation of the 2002 Schemes 
has been to make regular annual grants over the ten-year life of 
the scheme with annual grants over shares worth up to two times
annual salary. Exceptionally, executive recruitment needs and
general business strategy may have necessitated larger block 
grants in some years. The Committee normally restricted the total
cumulative options outstanding to any individual to a maximum 
of four times annual salary. Options vest only if the growth in the
Company's normalised earnings per share over the three, four or
five financial years (commencing with the year current at the date 
of grant) exceeds the growth in the Retail Price Index during the
same period by at least three percentage points per annum. This
form of performance test was adopted in 1995 and was selected 
to ensure that options do not vest unless the underlying financial
performance of the Company is satisfactory. 30 The Body Shop International PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2005
Remuneration Report continued
At the EGM to be held immediately after the AGM, a resolution 
will be proposed to approve a new Performance Share Scheme 
(the 2005 Scheme ). Full details of the 2005 Scheme are set out
in a separate letter from the Chairman accompanying the Notice of
EGM. Awards under the 2005 Scheme will normally take the form 
of either a contingent right to receive Ordinary Shares or a nil-cost
option, subject to performance conditions to be decided by the
Remuneration Committee. The value of the award will not normally
exceed 100% of base salary of the Executive Director or employee.
It is expected that the awards to be made following approval 
of the 2005 Scheme will not exceed 50% of the base salary of 
the Executive Director or employee. It is proposed that any awards
made in the current year will vest after three years, subject to a
performance condition that the growth in the Company's normalised
earnings per share over the three financial years (commencing with
the current year) exceeds 7.5% per annum. If the value of shares
awarded exceeds 50% of base salary, the Remuneration Committee
intends to impose a more stretching and scaled performance
condition. If any test is not met, the award will lapse.
An earnings per share (EPS) based performance condition has
been chosen as it aligns the awards made under the 2005 Scheme
with the profit growth strategy of the Company. The performance
level set is higher than that for the 2002 Schemes, which had a
performance test of earnings per share growth of 3% above the
Retail Price Index per annum. The Remuneration Committee has
considered the EPS performance condition in the context of the
business environment going forward and considers the 7.5% per
annum target for the 2005 awards to be appropriate.
On the introduction of the 2005 Scheme, the 2002 Schemes
will only be used to grant options approved by the Inland Revenue 
in the UK with a maximum value outstanding at any time of
 30,000. Where such options are granted, their vesting and
performance conditions will be similar to the new 2005 Scheme.
The Company operates a Savings Related Share Option
Scheme that is open to all UK employees including Executive
Directors. Options are granted at 80% of market value at the date 
of the invitation to participate and the maximum that can be saved
each month is limited to  250.
Details of the options held by each Director and the
performance condition applicable to each grant are set out in the
table headed Directors' Share Options. This includes details of the
performance conditions applicable to share options outstanding
under the previous 1995 scheme.
Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee
are to be required to build a shareholding of at least the value of
their current salary within four years of joining or, for existing
Directors and executives, within four years of this report.
Pension
Executive Directors (other than Adrian Bellamy) are entitled to
Company pension contributions at a rate of 12% of basic salary.
These contributions can be paid into the Company's Inland 
Revenue approved money purchase scheme or into another 
similar pension scheme.
Service Contracts
The Executive Directors have one year rolling service contracts.
These service contracts can be terminated by either the Company 
or the Executive Director, giving not less than 12 months notice,
and ultimately expire when the Director reaches retirement age
(either 60 or 65).
In the event that the Company requires the Director to leave
before the expiry of the notice period, the Company is obliged to 
pay the basic salary for any unexpired period of notice that is not
worked, together with associated benefits including pension
contributions. In addition, the Executive Directors are entitled to 
a pro rata proportion of the Annual Incentive Scheme earned in 
the year up until the termination of their employment.
The information in respect of each Director with a service
contract is as follows:
Adrian Bellamy
Contract date: 12 June 2002
Expiry: Age 65 or 12 months' notice
Peter Saunders
Contract date: 13 June 2002
Expiry: Age 60 or 12 months' notice
The service contract with Adrian Bellamy requires him to work 150
days per annum for the Company.
Taxable Benefits
In the year under review, private medical insurance and a car
allowance have been provided for Peter Saunders.
Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors initially serve a term that expires at the 
first Annual General Meeting at which they come up for re-election
on a rotational basis (which cannot exceed three years after the 
first Annual General Meeting following their appointment).
Thereafter, unless the Non-Executive Director has indicated a 
desire for a shorter term, they will serve until they next come 
up for re-election at an Annual General Meeting. Directors' Share Interests
The Directors who held office during the year had the following
beneficial interests in the ordinary shares of the Company:

Based on these principles, the Non-Executive Directors' current
terms will expire at the Annual General Meeting held in the years
shown below:

The current Non-Executive Directors do not have contracts of
service, are not eligible for pension scheme membership, and 
do not participate in the Group's share schemes or the Annual
Incentive Scheme. Under the Company's Articles of Association,
Non-Executive Directors are entitled to be paid in aggregate an
annual sum not exceeding  500,000. In addition they are entitled 
to reimbursement of out-of-pocket travel and accommodation costs
in connection with the performance of their duties.
Remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined 
by the Executive Chairman and Executive Directors, on the basis 
of independent advice on current fee levels in similar businesses.
Supplementary fees may be paid for devoting additional time and
expertise for the benefit of the Group. For the year ended 26
February 2005, the Non-Executive Directors were paid an annual
fee of  30,000 with Irene Miller and Jack Keenan receiving an
additional  10,000 as chairs of Board committees. The annual fee
for Non-Executive Directors has been increased by  10,000 from 
1 March 2005.
In addition to the fees paid to Dame Anita Roddick as a Non-
Executive Director, Anita Roddick Publications Ltd (ARP ) provides
the consultancy services of Dame Anita Roddick under an
agreement that commenced on 13 March 2002. This agreement
was for an initial period of two years and, thereafter for successive
periods of 12 months unless either the Company or ARP gives
notice to end the agreement no less than 30 days prior to the end
of any period. The annual fee payable to date has been  195,000.
The agreement has been extended to 13 March 2006 at an annual
rate of  137,500. The maximum compensation that could be
payable, in certain restricted circumstances, if the contract was
terminated before the end of its term, would be the balance of the
fee to the end of its term.
Performance Graph
Set out below is a graph comparing the cumulative total 
shareholder return (TSR ) from investing in the Company's 
ordinary shares against a similar investment in a block of shares
comprising the General Retailers' Index over the last five financial
years. The General Retailers' Index is considered the most
appropriate comparative index for the purposes of the performance
graph as the Company is a member of that index but for other
purposes, such as performance conditions for share options, there
may be other more appropriate indices and measures given the
nature of the business. 32 The Body Shop International PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2005
