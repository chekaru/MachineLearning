 30 The Body Shop International PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Remuneration Committee
For the year ended 25 February 2006, the Remuneration Committee 
(the Committee ) consisted of the following independent Non-
Executive Directors: Jack Keenan (Chairman), Irene Miller, Peggy 
Bruzelius (appointed 18 November 2005), Howard Mann (appointed 
18 November 2005) and Ronald de Waal (resigned 18 November 
2005). The Committee approves the total remuneration and 
employment terms of all senior executives in the Group including 
both annual and long-term incentive schemes.
The members of the Committee have no personal financial 
interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided, 
no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships, 
and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee consults the Executive Chairman, Chief 
Executive Officer and Director of Human Resources of the Company 
in arriving at its decisions, except when the remuneration of these 
executives is being considered.
The Committee has been advised by Towers Perrin, who have 
also provided general advice to the Committee and the Company  
on executive remuneration, including annual and long-term incentive 
schemes. 
Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors
The Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and members  
of the Executive Committee is designed to attract and retain the 
management skills necessary to develop the Group's international 
business. The Remuneration Policy set out below is applied 
consistently across the group of executives and has applied 
throughout the year to 25 February 2006. 
The Group aims to provide total remuneration arrangements 
that are appropriate to the nature of the business. Total 
remuneration is linked to both individual and Group performance, 
with the use of share schemes designed to encourage long-term 
commitment to the Group's success. This approach reflects the 
general basis for remuneration of all executives and managers 
within the Group.
Reviews have been carried out, supported by independent 
advice, to ensure that the range and level of remuneration continue 
to match current market rates. Compensation levels and packages 
are compared with those of executives with similar skills and 
experience, and with companies which can be compared to The 
Body Shop in terms of size, business sector, diversity and complexity 
of business, geographical spread of business or growth profile. 
Some Executive Directors have been recruited from international 
markets and, in these cases, the basic salaries reflect remuneration 
levels in the Executive Directors' home countries. 
In addition to basic salary, the remuneration package of 
Executive Directors includes an annual incentive scheme, pension 
benefits, participation in share schemes, and an element of non-
cash benefits.
Basic Salary
It is the Company's policy to ensure that basic salaries are 
appropriate and competitive for the responsibilities involved.  
The Company uses information from independent sources on the 
rates of salary for similar jobs. The basic salary for each Director  
for the year ended 25 February 2006 is shown in the Directors' 
Emoluments table set out in this report. The policy of the Company 
is to review their basic salary annually, or otherwise on promotion  
or change of responsibility, taking into account competitive market 
information and individual performance
Annual Incentive Scheme
The Company's Annual Incentive Scheme is designed to provide  
the Executive Directors with an incentive to achieve short-term 
performance targets. Bonus payments are non-pensionable and  
are subject to approval by the Committee. 
The bonus arrangements in place for both the year under 
review and the current year enable Executive Directors to earn an 
annual cash bonus for performance above a minimum target, with  
a maximum of 100% of basic salary payable if the highest 
performance targets are met. Any bonus depends upon the Group 
achieving a minimum profit target. The Group did not meet its 
minimum target relating to pre-tax profit in the year ended 25 
February 2006 and no bonuses are payable to Directors for the year 
under review. 
As a result of the operation of the Annual Incentive Scheme,  
up to 50% of each Executive Director's total annual remuneration 
(disregarding benefits and pension contributions) can be 
performance related if the highest performance targets are met.  
The performance element is further enhanced if Executive Directors 
are able to exercise their rights under share schemes.
Share Schemes
The Company believes that share ownership by Directors, executives 
and other managers strengthens the link between the personal 
interests of those individuals and those of shareholders. Since 1984, 
The Body Shop has encouraged long-term share ownership through 
widespread use of share options. At the 2005 Annual General 
Meeting, a new Performance Share Scheme (the 2005 Scheme ) 
was introduced. In addition, share options are granted under the 
Inland Revenue approved share option scheme (the 2002 
Scheme ).
The Committee approves all awards of shares and grants of 
share options. The Committee's policy is to make regular awards  
or grants over the ten-year life of the schemes, with annual awards 
or grants over shares worth up to two times annual salary. 
Exceptionally, executive recruitment needs and general business 
strategy may have necessitated larger block grants in some years. 
Awards under the 2005 Scheme take the form of either a 
contingent right to receive ordinary shares or a nil-cost option, 
subject to performance conditions to be decided by the 
Remuneration Committee. The share awards made in 2005, 
following approval of the 2005 Scheme, were up to 200% of  
Remuneration Report 31 The Body Shop International PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006
the base salary of the Executive Director or employee. The share 
awards or options vest after three years, subject to a performance 
condition that the growth in the Group's normalised compound 
earnings per share (EPS ) over the three financial years 
(commencing with the current year) exceeds 7.5% per annum.  
If the annual award is of 100% of base salary or greater, the vesting 
of the award is subject to a more stringent performance test and 
variable levels of vesting:  if the average annual compound growth 
in EPS over the three financial years to February 2008 is 12.5%  
or more, the award will vest in full; for growth of 10% but below 
12.5%, the level of vesting is 75%; and for growth of 7.5% but 
below 10%, the level of vesting is 50%. If any test is not met, the 
awards will lapse. 
Options granted before the introduction of the 2005 scheme 
vest only if the growth in the Group's normalised earnings per share 
over the three, four or five financial years (commencing with the 
year current at the date of grant) exceeds the growth in the Retail 
Price Index during the same period by at least three percentage 
points per annum. 
This form of performance test was adopted in 1995 and was 
selected to ensure that options do not vest unless the underlying 
financial performance of the Group is satisfactory. An EPS based 
performance condition has been chosen as it aligns the awards 
made under the 2005 Scheme and 2002 Scheme with the profit 
growth strategy of the Group. The Remuneration Committee has 
considered the EPS performance condition in the context of the 
business environment going forward and considers the variable 
performance test and the minimum 7.5% per annum target to  
be appropriate.
The Company operates a Savings Related Share Option Scheme 
that is open to all UK employees including Executive Directors. 
Options are granted at 80% of market value at the date of the 
invitation to participate and the maximum that can be saved each 
month is limited to  250.
Details of the options and performance shares held by each 
Director and the performance condition applicable to each grant are 
set out in the table headed Directors' Share Options. This includes 
details of the performance conditions applicable to share options 
outstanding under the previous 1995 scheme.
Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee 
are required to build a shareholding of at least the value of their 
current salary within four years of joining or, for Directors and 
executives holding office at June 2005, within three years of  
this report.
Pension
Executive Directors (other than the Executive Chairman, Adrian 
Bellamy) are entitled to Company pension contributions at a rate  
of 12% of basic salary. These contributions can be paid into the 
Company's Inland Revenue approved money purchase scheme  
or into another similar pension scheme. 
Service Contracts
The Executive Directors have one year rolling service contracts. 
These service contracts can be terminated by either the Company  
or the Executive Director, giving not less than 12 months notice, and 
ultimately expire when the Director reaches retirement age (either 
60 or 65). 
In the event that the Company requires the Director to leave 
before the expiry of the notice period, the Company is obliged to  
pay the basic salary for any unexpired period of notice that is not 
worked, together with associated benefits including pension 
contributions. In addition, the Executive Directors are entitled to a 
pro rata proportion of the Annual Incentive Scheme earned in the 
year up until the termination of their employment. 
The information in respect of each Director with a service 
contract is as follows:    
 Contract date Expiry
Adrian Bellamy  12 June 2002 Age 65 or 12  
(Executive Chairman)  months' notice
Peter Saunders  13 June 2002 Age 60 or 12 
(Chief Executive Officer)   months' notice
The service contract with Adrian Bellamy requires him to work 150 
days per annum for the Company. 
Taxable Benefits
In the year under review, private medical insurance and a car 
allowance have been provided for Peter Saunders. 
Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors initially serve a term that expires at the first 
Annual General Meeting at which they come up for re-election on  
a rotational basis (which cannot exceed three years after the first 
Annual General Meeting following their appointment). Thereafter, 
unless the Non-Executive Director has indicated a desire for a 
shorter term, they will serve until they next come up for re-election 
at an Annual General Meeting. 
Based on these principles, the Non-Executive Directors'  
current terms would, unless the Offer from L'Or al becomes wholly 
unconditional and L'Or al determines otherwise, expire at the Annual 
General Meeting held in the years shown below:
Jack Keenan  2006
Gordon Roddick  2006
Irene Miller  2007
Dame Anita Roddick 2007
Peggy Bruzelius  2009
Howard Mann  2009
Under the terms of the irrevocable undertakings given by the  
Non-Executive Directors in connection with the Offer from L'Or al,  
if the Offer becomes wholly unconditional all the Non-Executive 
Directors can be required by L'Or al to resign from the Board  
as soon as all proposals to option holders have been made in 
accordance with the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers. 32 The Body Shop International PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Remuneration Report continued
Peggy Bruzelius and Howard Mann have appointment letters, 
whilst the other Non-Executive Directors do not have appointment 
letters or contracts of service. None of the Non-Executive Directors 
are eligible for pension scheme membership and do not participate 
in the Group's share schemes or the Annual Incentive Scheme. 
Under the Company's Articles of Association, Non-Executive 
Directors are entitled to be paid in aggregate an annual sum not 
exceeding  500,000. In addition they are entitled to reimbursement 
of out-of-pocket travel and accommodation costs in connection with 
the performance of their duties.
Remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by 
the Executive Chairman and Executive Directors, on the basis of 
independent advice on current fee levels in similar businesses. 
Supplementary fees may be paid for devoting additional time and 
expertise for the benefit of the Group. For the year ended 25 
February 2006, the Non-Executive Directors were each paid a fee at 
an annual rate of  40,000 per annum, with Irene Miller and Jack 
Keenan each receiving an additional  10,000 as chairs of Board 
committees. 
In addition to the fees paid to Dame Anita Roddick as a Non-
Executive Director, Anita Roddick Publications Ltd (ARP ) provides 
the consultancy services of Dame Anita Roddick under an 
agreement that commenced on 13 March 2002. This agreement 
was for an initial period of two years and, thereafter, for successive 
periods of 12 months unless either the Company or ARP gives 
notice to end the agreement no less than 30 days prior to the end 
of any period. The annual fee payable to March 2005 was 
 195,000. The agreement was extended to 13 March 2006 at an 
annual rate of  137,500. The maximum compensation that could be 
payable, in certain restricted circumstances, if the contract was 
terminated before the end of its term, would be the balance of the 
fee to the end of its term.
Performance Graph
Set out below is a graph comparing the cumulative total shareholder 
return (TSR ) from investing in the Company's ordinary shares 
against a similar investment in a block of shares comprising the 
General Retailers' Index over the last five financial years. The 
General Retailers' Index is considered the most appropriate 
comparative index for the purposes of the performance graph as the 
Company is a member of that index but for other purposes, such as 
performance conditions for share options, there may be other more 
appropriate indices and measures given the nature of the business.
Directors' Share Interests
The Directors who held office during the year had the following 
beneficial interests in the ordinary shares of the Company:
 At 25 February  At 27 February  
  2006 or date 2005 or date  
 of resignation of appointment

1   In addition to the holdings shown, Dame Anita and Gordon Roddick, together with another 
individual, are trustees of a non-beneficial holding of 3,439,552 shares. The beneficial holders 
of these shares are the Roddick children. For the purposes of the Companies Act 1985, Dame 
Anita and Gordon Roddick are deemed to be interested in each other's shareholdings.
There have been no changes in Directors' share interests between 
the end of the financial year and 5 May 2006 except that all the 
Directors have given irrevocable undertakings in relation to the 
ordinary shares of the Company (if any) in which they are 
beneficially interested to accept the Offer from L'Or al for the entire 
share capital of the Company.
