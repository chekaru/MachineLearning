Board Report on Remuneration
The members of the remuneration committee during 2002 were Messrs
J.A.S. Wallace (Chairman), R.T. Scholes and B.A. Rickinson. J. Vogelsang
and L.P . Bermejo joined the committee with effect from 2 January 2003.
All members are Non-Executive Directors of the Company and have no
personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters
to be decided, no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross
directorships and no day to day involvement in running the business.
This report and the recommendations of the remuneration committee
have been approved in full by the Board for submission to shareholders.
In accordance with the requirements of the revised Companies Act, 
an ordinary resolution seeking shareholders' approval for the remuneration
report will be proposed at the annual general meeting. The tables
attached to this report disclosing directors' emoluments, pensions and
share options on pages 16 and 17 have been audited, together with
information on the performance criteria.
POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The committee makes recommendations to the Board concerning the
policy on remuneration for senior executives and the remuneration
package for each Executive Director. In determining the remuneration
policy the committee has given full consideration to the provisions on
the design of remuneration policies contained in the Combined Code.
During 2002 the committee appointed New Bridge Street Consultants
to provide independent market information and remuneration advice
(including advice covering the proposal to adopt a new share option
scheme). In addition the Company receives actuarial and other pensions
advice from JLT Benefit Consultants Limited in relation to the pension
scheme, of which five executive directors are members. Neither
organisation provides any other services to the Company. The committee
also consults with the Chief Executive, other than on matters concerning
his own remuneration.
The committee aims to provide a remuneration policy consistent with
the Group's overall objectives and thereby attract and retain high calibre
directors, align executive rewards with the creation of shareholder
value, motivate executives to achieve and maintain challenging levels
of performance, all in the light of Company and individual performance.
The committee has used the remuneration practices of UK engineering
businesses and other FTSE 250 companies, as well as other North
American and European companies in similar trades, as comparables.
Basic salaries are generally aimed to be within 10% of median relative
to similar businesses. In order to ensure that a substantial proportion
of the overall remuneration package can be linked to performance,
there is an annual bonus scheme and an executive share option scheme.
Only basic salaries are pensionable.
SALARY AND BONUSES
The basic salary of each Executive Director is reviewed annually and is
determined by taking into account the responsibilities and performance of
the individual, having regard to current market practice. However, for 2003,
after consultation with the Chief Executive, it was decided to leave basic
salaries unchanged and to put more emphasis on the variable elements.
A performance related annual bonus is payable to all Executive Directors
and selected senior executives, based on the Group's earnings before
interest and tax, the Group's return on invested capital and other qualitative
measurements. For those senior executives with divisional responsibilities,
part of the performance related bonus is based on their relevant sphere
of responsibility. 
The committee recommended an increase in the total potential bonus
for 2003 to 60% (2002: 40%) of basic salary, if all targets are met and
assuming that one-third of the bonus (i.e. up to 20% of salary) is paid
in the form of shares in the Company. The shares will be held in trust
for three years and will normally be forfeited if executives leave or are
dismissed. Executives may request that all their annual bonus is paid in cash,
in which case the maximum bonus would be 50% of salary. This illustrates
the increasing importance attached by the committee to the variable elements
of remuneration and encouraging long-term shareholding by executives.
Benefits in kind, which comprise the provision of a company car,
private medical insurance for the Director and family and long-term
disability insurance, are consistent with industry standards. An analysis
of Directors' emoluments is given on page 16.
The same overall policy on salary, bonus and incentives is applied 
to determine the remuneration of the managing directors and senior
executives of the strategic business units.
SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
The Group believes that participation in a share option scheme by
Executive Directors and other executives of the Group is important
and that it strengthens the link between executives' personal interests
and shareholders' interests. Bodycote's Board will encourage Directors
to build up a reasonable shareholding in the Company over a period
of time. However, it will not be prescriptive since the Directors' ability
to do so will depend on a number of factors not least being their own
personal commitments. The remuneration committee governs the
granting of share options to Directors and senior executives. An analysis
of Directors' share options is given on page 17.
Under the rules of the existing 1994 and 1996 schemes the exercise
cost of all options over unissued shares awarded to a Director cannot
exceed four times that Director's salary and bonus. Operation of the
1994 and 1996 schemes has been extended by using the employee share
ownership trust, so as to allow share options to be granted over a
greater number of shares. This has allowed greater incentives to be
made available to Directors and executives without further dilution of
the interests of shareholders. Share options granted under these schemes
are only exercisable if, over a period of three years from the date of the
award, the growth in the Group's earnings per share exceeds United
Kingdom retail inflation by 6% (10% in respect of those options granted
in September 2002). No awards can be made at a discount to the market
price. Following adoption of the new scheme outlined below, no further
options will be granted under the 1994 and 1996 schemes.  Bodycote annual report 2002 15
Following a review and advice from New Bridge Street Consultants
the committee has recommended the setting up of a new executive
share option scheme to replace the 1994 and 1996 schemes, which
the committee decided were unduly restrictive in terms of individual
and company limits and which did not reflect investors' current views
on limits and performance conditions. The elements of this new scheme,
which will be proposed for shareholder approval at the forthcoming
annual general meeting, are:
  The value of shares under options granted to an executive in any
year will not normally exceed 1.5 times basic salary. 
  No more than 10% of new issue ordinary share capital may 
be allocated under all of the Company's share schemes over 
a ten-year period.
  The exercise of options will be based on the Company's pre-tax
earnings per share growth relative to inflation. 
  The performance targets will be challenging since they will be
measured only over three or five years and the following targets
will apply for options granted in 2003.
The committee believes that, in relation to the 1994 and 1996 schemes
and the proposed new share option scheme, use of growth in earnings
per share is the most appropriate measure of the Company's financial
performance and is consistent with market practice and, because 
the performance test relies on publicly available data, is transparent.
The chairman of the remuneration committee assesses whether the
tests have been met. 
Directors made no gains on the exercise of share options during 2001 or
2002. The market price of Bodycote's ordinary shares at 31 December
2002 was 81.0p, the range during 2002 was 81.0p to 251.5p and the
average was 171.2p. The performance conditions attached to the options
granted before 1999 and still outstanding at 31 December 2002 have
been achieved. 
SERVICE CONTRACTS
It is the Group's policy that executive directors have service contracts
with a one-year notice period. All the Executive Directors currently have
service agreements which are terminable by one year's notice by either
party at any time, and by one year's remuneration in lieu of notice by
the employer, and by one year's remuneration in the event of termination
following a change in control of the Company. Legally appropriate factors
would be taken into account to mitigate any compensation payment,
covering basic salary, annual and long term incentives and benefits,
which may arise on the termination of employment of any Executive
Director, other than payments made on a change in control or for
payments in lieu of notice. Mr Hubbard's contract is dated 5 February
2002 and those for Messrs Landless and Sleight are each dated 
26 September 2001.
PENSIONS
Pensions for Executive Directors are, as far as allowable, provided for
under the Group's UK contributory final salary pension scheme which
has a normal retirement age of 65.
The main features, in respect of Executive Directors, are:
(a) Pensions from age 65 of 1/60th highest average of any consecutive
years three out of last ten years prior to retirement (restricted to the
earnings cap where it applies) for each year of pensionable service;
(b) A cash death-in-service benefit (restricted as before) of four times
basic salary at date of death;
(c) Spouse or dependant's pension on member's death equal to half
member's prospective retirement pension at 65 on death-in-service,
or half member's pension entitlement on death in retirement;
(d) Members' contributions are 6% of basic salary (restricted as before).
An analysis of accrued pension entitlements for the five Directors with
accruing benefits under the scheme during 2002 is given on page 16.
Mr Hubbard, the Chief Executive, is a member of the Group's US 401K
retirement plan to which the Group contributed  8,834 (2001:  955).
Contributions for Mr Landless' salary above the earnings cap amounted
to  5,684 (2001:  4,049).
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
The Group believes that there are benefits to the individual and the
Group for Executive Directors holding one non-executive directorship
in other organisations, provided that they do not conflict with the
Group's interests. 
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the
Executive Directors. Non-Executive Directors do not have formal service
agreements and are not entitled to any pension or other employment
benefits or to participate in any incentive scheme.
TSR PERFORMANCE
The graph on page 16 illustrates the Company's Total Shareholder
Return (TSR) performance since 1997, in accordance with paragraph 4
of the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, relative to
the FTSE Engineering & Machinery Index. The Company is a member
of the FTSE Engineering and Machinery Sector and, accordingly, 
this sector is considered to be the most appropriate comparator
group for this purpose.
