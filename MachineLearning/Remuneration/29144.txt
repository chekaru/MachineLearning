Board Report on Remuneration
The members of the Remuneration Committee during 2003 were
J.A.S. Wallace (Chairman), R.T. Scholes, B.A. Rickinson (until 28 
May 2003), J. Vogelsang and L.P Bermejo.
All members are Non-Executive Directors of the Company and have
no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters
to be decided, no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross
directorships and no day to day involvement in running the business.
The Committee met six times during 2003. 100% attendance was
recorded at meetings save for one absence by Mr Scholes and one
by Dr Rickinson. The Committee operates under terms of reference
approved by the Board in June 2002. These terms (which are available
to view on the Group website) will be revised during 2004 following
an evaluation of the Committee's performance.
This report for the year ended 31 December 2003 and the
recommendations of the Remuneration Committee have been approved
in full by the Board for submission to shareholders. In accordance
with the requirements of the Companies Act, an ordinary resolution
seeking shareholders' approval for the remuneration report will be
proposed at the Annual General Meeting. The tables attached to this
report disclosing Directors' emoluments, pensions and share options
on pages 16 and 17 have been audited, together with the performance
criteria and share price information.
POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board concerning the
policy on remuneration for senior executives and the remuneration
package for each Executive Director. In determining the remuneration
policy the Committee has given full consideration to the provisions on the
design of remuneration policies contained in the Combined Code and
received input from the Chief Executive. New Bridge Street Consultants
(who were appointed by the Committee) provided independent market
information and remuneration advice (including advice covering the
proposal to adopt a new share incentive scheme) during 2002 and 2003.
In addition during 2003 the Company received actuarial and other pensions
advice from JLT Benefit Consultants Limited (who were appointed by the
Company in 1995) in relation to the pension scheme, of which currently
two executive directors are members. Neither organisation provides
any other services to, or has any other connection with, the Company.
The Committee aims to provide a remuneration policy consistent 
with the Group's overall objectives and thereby attract and retain high
calibre senior executives, align executive rewards with the creation 
of shareholder value and motivate executives to achieve and maintain
challenging levels of Company and individual performance.
The Committee has used the remuneration practices of UK engineering
businesses and other FTSE 250 companies, as well as other North
American and European companies in similar trades, as comparables.
In order to ensure that a substantial proportion of the overall remuneration
package can be linked to performance, there is an annual bonus scheme
and an executive share option scheme. Only basic salaries are pensionable.
SALARY AND BONUSES
The basic salary of each Executive Director and senior executive 
is reviewed annually and is determined by taking into account the
responsibilities and performance of the individual, having regard to
current market practice. However, for 2003, after consultation with
the Chief Executive, it was decided to leave basic salaries unchanged
and put more emphasis on the variable elements.
A performance related annual bonus is payable to all Executive Directors
and senior executives, based on the Group's earnings before interest
and tax, the Group's return on invested capital and other qualitative
measurements. For those senior executives with Strategic Business
Unit responsibilities, part of the performance-related bonus is based on
their relevant sphere of responsibility.
In 2003 the Committee recommended an increase in the total potential
bonus for 2003 and 2004 to 60% (2002: 40%) of basic salary if all targets
are met and assuming that one-third of the bonus (i.e. up to 20% of salary)
is paid in the form of shares in the Company. The shares will be held
in trust for three years and will normally be forfeited if executives leave
or are dismissed. Executives may request that their entire annual
bonus is paid in cash, in which case the maximum bonus would be
50% of salary. This illustrates the increasing importance attached by the
committee to the variable elements of remuneration and encouraging
long-term shareholding by executives. No bonuses were paid in 2003
to executive directors as targets were not met.
Benefits in kind, which comprise the provision of a company car,
private medical insurance for the Director and family and long-term
disability insurance, are consistent with industry standards. An analysis
of Directors' emoluments is given on page 16.
SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
The Group believes that participation in a share option scheme by
Executive Directors and other executives of the Group is important
and that it strengthens the link between executives' personal interests
and shareholders' interests. Bodycote's Board will encourage Directors
to build up a reasonable shareholding in the Company over a period
of time. However, it will not be prescriptive since the Directors' ability
to do so will depend on a number of factors, not least being their own
personal commitments. The remuneration committee governs the
granting of share options to Directors and senior executives. Options
up to a maximum value of half annual salary were granted in the year
and an analysis of all Directors' share options is given on page 17.
Under the rules of the 1994 and 1996 schemes the exercise cost of
all options over unissued shares awarded to a Director cannot exceed
four times that Director's salary and bonus. Operation of the 1994 and
1996 schemes was extended by using the employee share ownership
trust. Share options granted under the 1994 and 1996 schemes are only
exercisable if, over any rolling period of three years from the date of the
award, the growth in the Group's earnings per share exceeds United
Kingdom retail inflation by 6% (10% in respect of those options granted
in September 2002).
ID1313 Bc AR 2003 v17  24/3/04  3:10 pm  Page 14 Bodycote annual report 2003 15
Following a review and advice in 2003 from New Bridge Street
Consultants shareholders approved the establishment of the 2003
Executive share option scheme to replace the 1994 and 1996 schemes,
under which no further options will be granted. The elements of the
2003 Scheme, under which 1,230,434 options were granted to executives
in September 2003, are: 
  The value of shares under options granted to an executive in any
year will not normally exceed 1.5 times basic salary.
  No more than 10% of the new issued ordinary share capital may
be allocated under all of the Company's share schemes over a
ten-year period.
  The exercise of options will be based on the Company's earnings
per share growth relative to inflation.
  No awards can be made at a discount to the market price
  The performance targets will be challenging since they will be measured
only over three or five years and the following targets will apply
The Committee believes that the use of growth in pre-tax earnings
per share is the most appropriate measure of the Company's financial
performance, is transparent (because the performance test relies on
publicly available data) and is consistent with market practice. The chairman
of the Remuneration Committee verifies that the tests have been met. 
Directors made no gains on the exercise of share options during 2002
or 2003. The market price of Bodycote's ordinary shares at 31 December
2003 was 141.75p, the range during 2003 was 65.5p to 181p and the
average was 122.4p. The performance conditions for options granted
since 1998 have yet to be achieved. The performance conditions
attached to the options granted before 1999 and still outstanding at
31 December 2003 have been achieved. 
SERVICE CONTRACTS
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors have service contracts
with a one-year notice period. All the Executive Directors have service
agreements which are terminable by one year's notice by either party
at any time, and by one year's remuneration in lieu of notice by the
employer, and by one year's remuneration in the event of a change 
in control of the company. Legally appropriate factors would be taken
into account to mitigate any compensation payment, covering basic
salary, annual and long term incentives and benefits, which may arise
on the termination of employment of any Executive Director, other than
payments made on a change in control or for payments in lieu of notice.
Mr Hubbard's contract is dated 5 February 2002 and those for Messrs
Landless and Sleight are each dated 26 September 2001.
PENSIONS
Pensions for Executive Directors are, as far as allowable, provided for
under the Group's UK contributory final salary pension scheme which
has a normal retirement age of 65.
The main features, in respect of Executive Directors, are:
(a) Pensions from age 65 of 1/60th highest average salary of any
consecutive three years out of last ten years prior to retirement
(restricted to the earnings cap where it applies) for each year of
pensionable service, and with increases in pensionable salary after
31 December 2003 restricted to 4.5% ( the Salary Limit');
(b) A cash death-in-service benefit of four times basic salary at date of death;
(c) Spouse or dependent's pension on member's death equal to half
member's prospective retirement pension (restricted as before) at
65 on death in service, or half member's pension entitlement on
death in retirement;
(d) Members' contributions are 6% of basic salary.
(e) For Executive Directors with basic salaries above the Salary Limit
or the earnings cap the Group will contribute 14% of the excess
over the Salary Limit to a defined contribution arrangement.
Arrangements for Mr Hubbard are for a contribution to a defined
benefit arrangement of 14% of his basic salary (including any payments
being made by the Group into the Group's US 401k retirement plan)
from January 2004 onwards.
An analysis of accrued pension entitlements for the three Directors with
accruing benefits under the scheme during 2003 is given on page 16.
Mr Hubbard, the Chief Executive, is a member of the Group's US 401K
retirement plan to which the Group contributed  3,660 (2002:  8,834).
Pension contributions for Mr Landless' salary above the earnings cap
amounted to  6,684 (2002:  5,684).
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
The Company believes that there are benefits to the individual and
the Company for Executive Directors' holding one non-executive
directorship in other organisations, provided that they do not conflict
with the Company's interests.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the
Chairman and the Executive Directors. Remuneration for the Chairman
is determined by the whole Board (excluding the Chairman). Non-Executive
Directors do not have formal service agreements and are not entitled
to any pension or other employment benefits or to participate in any
incentive scheme. Payment in respect of Mr Vogelsang's service is
made to a company owned by him.
TSR PERFORMANCE
The graph on page 16 illustrates the Company's Total Shareholder
Return (TSR) performance since 1998 in accordance with paragraph 
4 of the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, relative 
to the FTSE Engineering & Machinery Index, of which the Company
is a component part. Accordingly this sector is considered to be the
most appropriate comparator group for this purpose.
