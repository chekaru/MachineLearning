Board Report on Remuneration
The members of the Remuneration Committee during 2004 were
J. Vogelsang (Chairman from November 2004), J.A.S. Wallace (Chairman
until November 2004 when he stepped down from the committee),
R.T. Scholes, and L.P Bermejo. All current members are independent
Non-Executive Directors of the Company and have no personal financial
interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided,
no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross directorships and
no day to day involvement in running the business.
The Committee met five times during 2004. 100% attendance was
recorded at meetings. The Committee operates under terms of reference
approved by the Board. These terms, which are available to view on the
Group website, were revised in November 2004 following an evaluation
of the Committee's performance. This Board Report on Remuneration
for the year ended 31 December 2004 and the recommendations of the
Remuneration Committee have been approved in full by the Board for
submission to shareholders. In accordance with the requirements of the
Companies Act, an ordinary resolution seeking shareholders' approval
for the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting. The tables
attached to this report disclosing Directors' emoluments, pensions and
share options on pages 16 and 17 have been audited, together with the
performance criteria and share price information.
POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board concerning the
policy on remuneration for senior executives and the remuneration
package for each Executive Director. In determining the remuneration
policy the Committee has given full consideration to the provisions on
the design of remuneration policies contained in the 2003 Code and
received input from the Chief Executive. New Bridge Street Consultants
provided independent market information and remuneration advice during
2002 and 2003. In 2005, the Committee appointed Inbucon Consulting
to give advice and prepare documentation for the operation of the group's
new stock bonus plan. In addition, during 2004 the Company received
actuarial and other pensions advice from JLT Benefit Consultants Limited
(who were appointed by the Company in 1995) in relation to the pension
scheme, of which currently two Executive Directors are members. None
of these organisations provides any other services to, or has any other
connection with, the Company.
The Committee aims to provide a remuneration policy consistent with the
Group's overall objectives and thereby attract and retain high calibre senior
executives, align executive rewards with the creation of shareholder value
and motivate executives to achieve and maintain challenging levels of
Company and individual performance.
The Committee has used the remuneration practices of UK engineering
businesses and other FTSE 250 companies, as well as North American
and European companies in similar trades, as comparables. In order to
ensure that a substantial proportion of the overall remuneration package
can be linked to performance, there are annual bonus schemes and an
executive share option scheme. Only basic salaries are pensionable.
SALARY AND BENEFITS
The basic salary of each Executive Director and senior executive
is reviewed annually and is determined by taking into account the
responsibilities and performance of the individual, having regard to
current market practice. Since 2002 the committee has decided to
place more emphasis on the variable elements of Directors' and senior
executives' pay although market and inflationary adjustments have
been made to basic salaries after benchmarking.
This resulted in increases in basic salary for Directors both in 2004
and 2005. The basic salaries of the Executive Directors were
increased on 1 January 2005 to the following amounts:
 
Mr J.D. Hubbard 325,000
Mr D.F. Landless 215,000
Mr D.R. Sleight 161,000
Benefits in kind, which comprise the provision of a company car,
private medical insurance for the Executive Director and family and
long-term disability insurance, are consistent with industry standards.
An analysis of Directors' emoluments is given on page 17. 
ANNUAL BONUSES 
A performance related annual cash bonus is payable to all Executive
Directors and senior executives, based on the Group's earnings before
interest and tax (EBIT), the Group's return on capital employed (ROCE) and
other qualitative measurements, including health and safety. For those
senior executives with Strategic Business Unit responsibilities, part
of the performance-related bonus is based on their relevant sphere of
responsibility. Targets for 2004 maximum bonus required increases in
EBIT, ROCE, organic sales growth and quantitative improvements in health
and safety. The bonuses paid to Executive Directors are shown on page 17.
In 2003 the Committee recommended an increase in the total potential
bonus to 60% of basic salary if all targets are met and assuming that
one-third of the bonus (i.e. up to 20% of salary) is paid in the form of
shares in the Company. The shares will be held in trust for three years
and will normally be forfeited if executives leave for another employer
or are dismissed. Executives could request that their entire annual bonus
is paid in cash, in which case the maximum bonus would be 50% of
salary. This scheme applied to 2003 and 2004 only.
In 2005 the Committee, with the benefit of advice from Inbucon Consulting,
decided to alter the annual bonus arrangements affecting Executive
Directors and senior executives from and including 2005 so that: -
(1) Total maximum bonus would increase to 100% of basic salary
comprising two elements:-
(a) A maximum cash bonus of 50% of basic salary earned by references
to challenging increases in EBIT, ROCE, organic sales growth and
quantitative improvements in health and safety.
(b) An additional bonus of up to 50% of basic salary, received as
restricted shares in the Company, if the Group's total shareholder
return (TSR) for the year is in the upper quartile of TSR achieved
by companies within the FTSE 350 Engineering & Machinery Index
and certain international comparator companies. The comparator
group consists of 17 companies, including Bodycote. Median TSR
performance would attract a stock bonus of 12.5% of basic salary.
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to take into account
the underlying financial performance of the Company before stock
bonuses can be paid.
(2) The stock bonus element will be serviced using shares bought in
the market. The shares will be held by the trustees of the Company's
employee share ownership trust for three years after which they
would vest, but each participant would be expected to retain the stock
awarded (save for amounts necessary to pay tax) until the total value
of shares held equalled the executive's basic salary. At the end of the
holding period, the awards will be enhanced by an amount reflecting
dividends paid on the award shares over the three-year period.

Board Report on Remuneration
The committee has recommended this plan because it encourages
challenging performance, increases the variable element of pay and
aligns executives' interests with those of shareholders. Performance
will be measured over one year in order to maintain a balance between
annual bonus arrangements and long-term incentives.
This further illustrates the increasing importance attached by the
committee to the variable elements of remuneration and encouraging
long-term shareholding by executives. 
The committee also recommended payment of a special bonus of
 35,000 to the Corporate Development Director to recognise his
success in the disposal of the wet coatings businesses and the
transfer of Bodycote's PVD interests to IonBond.
No bonuses were paid to Executive Directors in respect of 2002
and 2003 as targets were not met. 
SHARE INCENTIVES
The Group believes that participation in share incentive schemes by
Executive Directors and other executives of the Group strengthens the
link between executives' personal interests and shareholders' interests.
Bodycote's Board will encourage Directors and Executives to build up a
reasonable shareholding in the Company over a period of time, but it
will not be prescriptive since the Directors' ability to do so will depend
on a number of factors, not least being their own personal commitments.
SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
The Remuneration Committee governs the granting of share incentives
to Directors and senior executives. An analysis of all Directors' share
options is given on page 16.
Following a review and advice in 2003 from New Bridge Street
Consultants, shareholders approved the establishment of the 2003
Executive share option scheme to replace the 1994 and 1996 schemes,
under which no further options will be granted. Under the 2003 Scheme,
the value of shares over which options may be granted to an executive
in any year may not normally exceed 1.5 times basic salary. The extent
to which options may be exercised will depend on the Company's growth
in pre-tax earnings per share (EPS) exceeding the growth in the retail
price index (RPI) over the three or five year period following grant.
(The committee have decided that for any options granted after September
2003 performance would be measured only over a single three-year
period.) Options over shares worth up to 0.5 times basic salary may be
exercised if the growth in EPS exceeds the growth in RPI by 3% per
year, options over shares worth up to 1.5 times basic salary may be
exercised if the growth in EPS exceeds the growth in RPI by 10% per
year, with intermediate levels of vesting between these two points.
The Committee believes that the use of growth in pre-tax earnings
per share is the most appropriate measure of the Company's financial
performance, is transparent (because the performance test relies on
publicly available data) and is consistent with market practice. The chairman
of the Remuneration Committee will verify that the tests have been met. 
Share options granted under the 1994 and 1996 share option schemes
are only exercisable if, over any rolling period of three years from the
date of the award, the growth in the Group's earnings per share exceeds
United Kingdom retail inflation by 6% (10% in respect of those options
granted in September 2002). Operation of the 1994 and 1996 schemes
was extended by using the employee share ownership trust.
Directors made no gains on the exercise of share options during 2003
or 2004. The market price of Bodycote's ordinary shares at 31 December
2004 was 163.5p, the range during 2004 was 125.88p to 165.5p and
the average was 144.68p. The performance conditions for options
granted since 1998 have yet to be achieved. The performance conditions
attached to the options granted before 1999 and still outstanding at
31 December 2004 have been achieved. No options have been granted
since September 2003.
Following the implementation of International Financial Reporting
Standards from 1 January 2005, the Committee will be reviewing
its policy on long-term incentives generally.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors have service contracts
with a one-year notice period. All the Executive Directors have service
agreements which are terminable by one year's notice by either party
at any time, and by one year's remuneration in lieu of notice by the
employer, and by one year's remuneration in the event of a change
in control of the Company. Legally appropriate factors would be taken
into account to mitigate any compensation payment, covering basic
salary, annual and long term incentives and benefits, which may arise
on the termination of employment of any Executive Director, other than
payments made on a change in control or for payments in lieu of notice.
Mr Hubbard's contracts are dated 5 February 2002 and those for Messrs
Landless and Sleight are each dated 26 September 2001.
PENSIONS
Pensions for current UK domiciled Executive Directors are, as far as
practicable, provided for under the Group's UK contributory final salary
pension scheme which has a normal retirement age of 65 and is closed
to new members. 
The main features, in respect of Executive Directors, are:
(a) Pensions from age 65 of 1/60th highest average salary of any
consecutive three years out of last ten years prior to retirement
(restricted to the earnings cap where it applies) for each year of
pensionable service, and with increases in pensionable salary after
31 December 2003 restricted to 4.5% per annum ( the Salary Limit');
(b) A cash death-in-service benefit of four times basic salary at date of death;
(c) Spouse or dependent's pension on member's death equal to half
member's prospective retirement pension (restricted as before)
at 65 or death in service, or half member's pension entitlement
on death in retirement;
(d) Members' contributions are 6% (7% from April 2005) of basic salary.
(e) For Executive Directors with basic salaries above the Salary Limit
or the earnings cap the Group will contribute 14% of the excess
over the Salary Limit to a defined contribution arrangement.
Arrangements for Mr Hubbard are for a contribution to a defined benefit
arrangement of 14% of his basic salary (including any payments being
made by the Group into the Group's US 401k retirement plan) from
January 2004 onwards.
An analysis of accrued pension entitlements for the two Directors with
accruing benefits under the scheme during 2004 is given on page 17.
Mr Hubbard, the Chief Executive, is a member of the Group's US 401K
retirement plan to which the Group contributed  14,163 (2003:  3,660).
Pension contributions for Mr Landless' salary above the earnings cap
amounted to  22,606 (2003:  6,684).

EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
The Company believes that there are benefits to the individual and the
Company for Executive Directors to hold one appropriate non-executive
directorship in other organisations, as long as it does not conflict with the
Company's interests and that the individual may retain the fees earned
in connection with such appointment.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the
Chairman and the Executive Directors. Remuneration for the Chairman
is determined by the whole Board (excluding the Chairman). Remuneration
for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors takes into account the
time commitments and duties and responsibilities involved. The Chairman
and each Non-Executive Director hold letters of appointment for terms
of three years. Each is terminable under the Company's articles of
association or the Companies Act 1985, by the director's resignation
or otherwise on six months' notice (twelve months in the case of the
Chairman) if termination occurs before expiry of the term. The Chairman
and Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any pension or other
employment benefits or to participate in any incentive scheme. Payment
in respect of Mr Vogelsang's service is made to a company owned by him.
TSR PERFORMANCE
The graph on page 17 illustrates the Company's Total Shareholder Return
(TSR) performance since 1999 in accordance with paragraph 4 of the
Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, relative to the FTSE
Engineering & Machinery Index, of which the Company is a component
part. Accordingly this sector is considered to be the most appropriate
comparator group for this purpose.
