Board Report on Remuneration
The members of the Remuneration Committee during 2005 were
J. Vogelsang (Chairman), R.T. Scholes, and L.P Bermejo. All members
are Non-Executive Directors of the Company and have no personal
financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be
decided, no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross directorships
and no day to day involvement in running the business.
The Committee met six times during 2005. 100% attendance was
recorded at meetings. The Committee operates under terms of reference
(which can be viewed on the Group's website) revised by the Board in
November 2004 following an evaluation of the Committee's performance
in that year. 
This Board Report on Remuneration for the year ended 31 December
2005 and the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee have
been approved in full by the Board for submission to shareholders.
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act, an ordinary
resolution seeking shareholders' approval for the report will be proposed
at the Annual General Meeting. The tables attached to this report
disclosing Directors' emoluments, pensions and share options and
incentives on pages 22 and 23 have been audited, together with the
performance criteria and share price information.
ADVICE
The Committee has taken advice from Inbucon Consulting in relation to
Executive Directors' salary levels, the stock bonus scheme implemented
for 2005 and measurement of total shareholder return (TSR) in
accordance with the scheme rules, and in relation to the proposal to
seek approval for a new long-term share incentive and share matching
plan as detailed below.
The Company also received actuarial and other pensions advice from
JLT Benefit Consultants Limited (appointed by the Company in 1995)
and are currently taking advice from KPMG LLP (appointed by the
Company in 2005) in relation to the management of risk arising from
the UK final salary pension scheme of which currently two Executive
Directors are members, out of an active membership of 314. Although
KPMG LLP may provide occasional ad hoc services to the Company as
a general consultant in relation to due diligence on selected acquisitions
and other projects, neither of the other organisations provides any
other services to, or has any other connection with, the Company.
POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board concerning the
policy on remuneration for senior executives and the remuneration
package for each Executive Director. In determining the remuneration
policy the Committee has given full consideration to the provisions on
the design of remuneration policies contained in the Combined Code
and received input from the Chief Executive. The Committee aims
to provide a remuneration policy consistent with the Group's overall
strategic objectives and thereby attract and retain high calibre executives,
align executive rewards with the creation of shareholder value and
motivate executives to achieve and maintain challenging levels of
Company and individual performance. The Committee has used the
remuneration practices of UK engineering businesses and other
FTSE 250 companies, as well as other North American and European
companies in similar trades, as comparables.
The Remuneration Committee believe that once properly benchmarked
against the market and in relation to the complexity, scale and size of
the responsibilities, increases in basic salary should be modest to
reflect inflationary elements with the aim that the proportion of fixed
remuneration is reduced and to provide for a growing element of
variable pay.
In order to ensure that a substantial proportion of the overall remuneration
package can be linked to performance, there is an annual cash bonus
scheme, executive share option schemes (up to 2003), the 2005
stock bonus scheme and a proposal for a new long-term share-based
incentive and share matching plan for adoption at the 2006 Annual
General Meeting. Only basic salaries are pensionable.
SALARY AND BENEFITS
The basic salary of each Executive Director and senior executive
is reviewed annually and is determined by taking into account the
responsibilities and performance of the individual, having regard to
current market practice. Since 2002 the Committee has placed more
emphasis on the variable elements of Directors' and senior executives'
pay although modest market and inflationary adjustments have been
made to basic salaries after benchmarking. This resulted in increases
in basic salary for Executive Directors both in 2005 and 2006. At his
insistence there has been no increase in the Chief Executive's basic
salary for 2006. The basic salaries of the other Executive Directors
were increased on 1 January 2006 to the following amounts:
Mr D.F. Landless  226,000
Mr D.R. Sleight  168,000
Benefits in kind, which comprise the provision of a company car,
private medical insurance for the Director and family and long-term
disability insurance, are consistent with industry standards. An analysis
of Directors' emoluments is given on page 23.
ANNUAL BONUSES 
For 2005 an annual bonus is payable to all Executive Directors and
senior executives, based on the Group and individual performance.
For those senior executives with Strategic Business Unit (SBU)
responsibilities, part of the performance-related bonus is based on
their relevant sphere of responsibility.
Payment of the maximum cash bonus for 2005 required Executive
Directors and senior executives to achieve challenging target increases
over 2004 performance in EBIT (93% achieved), ROCE (72% achieved)
and organic sales (60% achieved) and quantitative improvements in
safety and health (50% achieved). As a result Executive Directors
received a cash bonus of 38.5% of basic salary (against a maximum
of 50%) and senior executives' cash bonuses ranged from 20% to 42%
depending upon individual SBU performances (again compared to
maximum of 50%). Details of the cash bonuses paid to Executive
Directors are shown on page 23. Bodycote annual report 2005 19
An additional bonus of up to 50% of basic salary, received as restricted
shares in the Company, to be awarded after the results for the 2005
financial year are announced, will be payable as a result of the Group's
2005 TSR performance in accordance with the rules of the short term
stock bonus scheme. The Group's performance was in the upper quartile
of TSR achieved by companies within the FTSE 350 Engineering &
Machinery Index and certain other comparator companies and, as a
consequence, the maximum award will be made. The graph below
illustrates the TSR performance of the Group against the peer group
which includes companies representing the Group's geographical
spread of businesses. The peer group consisted of 17 companies,
including Bodycote. The Remuneration Committee have also taken
into account the underlying financial performance of the Company
before agreeing that these stock bonuses can be granted.
The shares will vest in 2009, but each Executive Director would be
required to retain the stock awarded (save for amounts necessary
to pay tax) until the total value of shares held equals the executive's
basic salary. At the end of the holding period, the awards will be
enhanced by an amount reflecting dividends paid on the award
shares over the three-year period.
The Committee recommended this plan for 2005 because it encourages
challenging performance, increases the variable element of pay and aligns
executives' interests with those of shareholders. The 2005 stock bonus
scheme will be replaced by the long-term share incentive schemes
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
For 2006 the annual cash bonus programme has been increased to a
maximum 60% of basic salary earned by achieving further challenging
increases in ROCE, Economic Profit and organic sales and quantitative
improvements in safety and health, together with achievement of
environmental accreditations and implementation of technologies
to improve capacity management. If the proposal to adopt the
Bodycote Incentive Plan (as detailed below) is approved by shareholders,
participants in the 2006 cash bonus programme will be able to defer
up to 20% of basic salary into a share matching arrangement.
REVIEW OF LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
The Group believes that participation in share incentive schemes by
Executive Directors and other executives of the Group strengthens the
link between executives' personal interests and shareholders' interests.
Following the implementation of International Financial Reporting
Standards from 1 January 2005, the Committee decided to review
the arrangements for long-term incentives so that there would be an
appropriate balance between short and long-term incentives with an
increasing proportion devoted to performance-related pay. To promote
creation of shareholder value, the Remuneration Committee seeks
to encourage and incentivise  stretch' or exceptional and sustainable
financial performances over each three year period, as measured against
the strategic plans formulated for the Group. It was decided not to
grant any further share options under the 2003 scheme, but to propose
adoption by shareholders of a new long-term share incentive scheme
( the Bodycote Incentive Plan'), which will comprise two elements:
(1) A conditional award of shares; 
(a) A conditional award of shares which will vest on the third
anniversary of the date of grant.
(b) Awards can be made annually and the amount awarded
will be based upon achievement of targeted Economic Profit
performance for the prior year.
(c) The number of shares forming a conditional award to Executive
Directors will not exceed 1.75 times basic salary.
(d) The number of shares which vest on the third anniversary will
depend on the Economic Profit growth of the Group in the three
year period commencing with the year of grant.
(2) Award of shares to match bonus payments deferred by executives
from their annual cash bonus (if any) in that participants can defer
up to 20% of salary or the bonus earned (whichever is the lesser) to
be converted into shares which will be held for 3 years and matched
at rates between 1 for 2 and 1 for 1 shares depending on growth
of the Group's ROCE during the three year period of deferment.

Scheme Peer Group (excluding Bodycote). 1 October 2004 to 31 December 2005 is illustrated because the scheme rules require 3-month share price
averaging at start and end of 2005 financial year performance period. 
Share
price
(p)
Bodycote International plc Bespoke Comparator Group (excl. Bodycote) Economic Profit for these purposes is defined as earnings before
interest and tax (EBIT), less a charge for the cost of the aggregate
average of shareholders' funds, net borrowings and goodwill
previously written off to reserves, impaired or amortised.
Only Executive Directors and other nominated full-time employees
will be eligible to participate.
No awards may be granted more than 10 years after adoption of the
plan by shareholders.
No more than 5% of new issue ordinary share capital may be allocated
under all of the Company's share schemes over a 10 year period.
Leavers will not normally be entitled to receive conditional awards
and or an award of matching shares which in each case will lapse
upon a participant leaving group employment.
If approved by shareholders the awards can be made in each of the
financial years 2006 to 2015 (although the Committee can decide
either to scale back awards or not to make awards in any one year).
The final outcome of the first awards proposed to be made in 2006
will depend upon the Group's Economic Profit performance in the
period 2006 to 2008.
It is anticipated that adoption of this scheme will suitably emphasise
the increasing importance attached by the Committee to the variable
elements of remuneration and encourage long-term shareholding
and commitment by executives. The Remuneration Committee has
decided to propose a long-term incentive scheme based upon growth
in Economic Profit because this aligns the scheme with the Group's
business objectives, strategy and plan, and the long-term interests of
shareholders, in that sustainable and profitable growth should be
achieved and because it focuses directly on those elements, which
executives have the capacity to influence.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' SHAREHOLDING RETENTION POLICY
The Committee will introduce a shareholding retention policy under
which Executive Directors and other senior executives will be required,
within five years, to build up a shareholding in the Company. In respect
of Executive Directors the requirement will be for their Directors'
interests in shares to be worth at least 100% of basic salary.
SHARE INCENTIVES - old arrangements
The Remuneration Committee also reviews and manages share
incentive schemes established between 1994 and 2003 and under
which awards have yet to vest. Following adoption of the Bodycote
Incentive Plan no further share options will be granted to Directors
or executives and staff pursuant to the 2003 executive share option
scheme, but share options granted before this decision will continue
to be capable of exercise. At the time each scheme was approved
by shareholders, institutional guidelines were followed and latterly
leading investors were consulted.
All outstanding share options have now qualified for exercise. Options
granted since 1998 have all qualified on the basis of the increase in
headline earnings per share (EPS) since 2002 using the UK GAAP EPS
data for 2002 to 2004 and the IFRS headline EPS figure for 2005. Having
received and reviewed a reconciliation between the two accounting
standards (the calculations for which have been approved by the Audit
Committee), the Committee were satisfied that each performance
criterion had been met by a wide margin.
Share options granted under the 1994 and 1996 share option schemes
were only exercisable if, over any rolling period of three years from the
date of the award, the growth in the Group's headline EPS exceeds
United Kingdom retail inflation by 6% (10% in respect of those options
granted in September 2002).
Under the 2003 scheme the value of shares over which options may
be granted to an executive in any one year may not normally exceed
1.5 times basic salary. The extent to which options may be exercised
will depend on the Company's growth in pre-tax EPS exceeding the
growth in the retail price index (RPI) in the three or five year period
following grant. Options over shares worth up to 0.5 times salary may
be exercised if the growth in EPS exceeds the growth in RPI by 3%
per annum.
The Committee believed that the use of growth in pre-tax EPS was
at the time the most appropriate measure of the Company's financial
performance and was consistent with market practice, when adopted.
Directors made no gains on the exercise of share options during 2004
or 2005. The market price of Bodycote's ordinary shares at 31 December
2005 was 222.0p, the range during 2005 was 146.75p to 239.25p and
the average was 190.03p. An analysis of all Directors' share options
is given on page 22.
DEFERRED RESTRICTED STOCK BONUS SCHEME 2003 to 2004 
In respect of annual cash bonuses payable for 2003 and 2004,
Executive Directors and Senior Executives were permitted to defer
up to one-third of their cash bonus into shares which were then to
be held for three years and which the Company would then match.
Details of shares held by Directors pursuant to this scheme are given
below. If shareholders approve the share matching scheme forming
part of the proposed new Bodycote Incentive Scheme, then Executive
Directors and Senior Executives will be able to defer cash bonuses
received for 2006 and subsequently convert them into shares and obtain
matching shares depending on the Group's ROCE performance during
the three-year period of deferment.

Board Report on Remuneration
20 Bodycote annual report 2005 SERVICE CONTRACTS
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors have service contracts
with a one year notice period. All the Executive Directors have service
agreements which are terminable by one year's notice by either party
at any time, and by one year's remuneration in lieu of notice by the
employer, and by one year's remuneration in the event of a change
in control of the Company. Legally appropriate factors would be taken
into account to mitigate any compensation payment, covering basic
salary, annual and long term incentives and benefits, which may arise
on the termination of employment of any Executive Director, other than
payments made on a change in control or for payments in lieu of notice.
Mr Hubbard's contract is dated 5 February 2002 and those for Messrs
Landless and Sleight are each dated 26 September 2001.
PENSIONS
Pensions for current UK domiciled Executive Directors are, as far as
practicable, provided for under the Group's UK contributory final salary
pension scheme which has a normal retirement age of 65 and which
is closed to new members.
The main features, in respect of Executive Directors, are:
(a) Pensions from age 65 of 1/60th highest average salary of any
consecutive three years out of last ten years prior to retirement
(restricted to the earnings cap where it applies) for each year of
pensionable service, and with increases in pensionable salary
after 31 December 2003 restricted to 4.25% ( the Salary Limit');
(b) A cash death-in-service benefit of four times basic salary at
date of death;
(c) Spouse or dependant's pension on member's death equal to half
member's prospective retirement pension (restricted as before)
at 65 on death in service, or half member's pension entitlement
on death in retirement;
(d) Members' contributions are 7% (6% up until April 2005)
of basic salary;
(e) For Executive Directors with basic salaries above the Salary Limit
or the earnings cap the Group will contribute 14% of the excess
to a defined contribution arrangement.
Arrangements for Mr Hubbard are for a contribution to a defined benefit
arrangement of 14% of his basic salary (including any payments being
made by the Group into the Group's US 401k retirement plan) from
January 2004 onwards.
An analysis of accrued pension entitlements for the two Directors with
accruing benefits under the scheme during 2005 is given on page 23. 
Mr Hubbard, the Chief Executive, is a member of the Group's US 401K
retirement plan to which the Group contributed  24,362 (2004:  14,163).
Pension contributions for Mr Landless' salary above the earnings cap
amounted to  15,540 (2004:  22,606).
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
The Company believes that there are benefits to the individual
and the Company for Executive Directors holding one non-executive
directorship in other organisations, provided that they do not conflict
with the Company's interests and that, provided the Director's
performance is not impaired, he could retain the fees earned in
connection with such an appointment.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by
the Chairman and the Executive Directors. Remuneration for the
Chairman is determined by the whole Board (excluding the Chairman).
Remuneration for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors takes
into account the time commitments and duties and responsibilities
involved. The Chairman and each Non-Executive Director hold letters of
appointment for terms of three years. Each is terminable under the
Company's articles of association, the Companies Act 1985, the Director's
resignation or otherwise on six months' notice (twelve months in the
case of the Chairman) if termination occurs before expiry of the term.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any
pension or other employment benefits or to participate in any incentive
scheme. Payment in respect of Mr Vogelsang's service is made to
a company owned by him.
TSR PERFORMANCE
The graph on page 22 illustrates the Company's Total Shareholder
Return (TSR) performance since 2000 in accordance with paragraph
4 of the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, relative to
the FTSE Engineering & Machinery Index, of which the Company is
a component part. The index was selected in 2002 as the most
appropriate comparator group and has been used again this year to
be consistent with prior years.
Approved by the Board.
