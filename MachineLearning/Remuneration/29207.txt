 18 Bodycote annual report 2006
Board Report on Remuneration
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for remuneration
policies that create value for shareholders.
Remuneration structures and packages therefore include moderate
base salaries, a high potential for variable pay but clearly linked with
absolute value delivered in the business, with key business value
drivers used as a basis for measuring performance and a significant
proportion of variable pay in restricted conditional shares.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and describes how the
Board has applied the principles of the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance in relation to the remuneration of the Directors.
As required by the Remuneration Report Regulations, a resolution to
approve the Board Report on Remuneration will be proposed at the
Annual General Meeting of the Company. The Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee will be available at the Annual General Meeting
to answer questions about Directors' remuneration.
The sections of this report dealing with Directors' emoluments paid,
pensions and share options and incentives have been audited. The
remaining sections are not subject to audit.
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board the
remuneration of Executive Directors and senior executives (in all its
forms), and the terms of the service contracts and all other terms and
conditions of employment of the Executive Directors. The Committee's
full terms of reference are available on the Group's website.
The members of the Remuneration Committee during 2006 were
J. Vogelsang (Chairman), R.T. Scholes and L.P Bermejo.
The Committee has taken advice from Ernst & Young LLP (appointed
by the Remuneration Committee in 2006) to provide independent
advice in determining appropriate levels of remuneration. In addition,
the Company received actuarial and other pensions advice from JLT
Benefit Consultants Limited (appointed in 1995) and from KPMG LLP
(appointed in 2005) in relation to the management of risk arising from
the UK final salary pension scheme.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Committee aims to provide a remuneration policy consistent with
the Group's overall business objectives and thereby attract and retain
high calibre executives, align executives rewards with the creation
of shareholder value and motivate executives to achieve and maintain
challenging levels of company and individual performance. Market rates
are determined by reference to other companies of similar size,
activities and complexity. At the same time, policy in this area is
sensitive to the remuneration structure within the Group. 
The Committee keeps both the fixed and variable elements of each
Executive Director's and senior executive's overall package under
review. In recent years, the Committee has progressively increased the
proportion of variable as against fixed element of pay.
The changes introduced include:
  Performance related annual bonus potential increased for all
executives for 2006; 
  The 2003 share option scheme being replaced in 2006 by a
long-term incentive plan known as the Bodycote Incentive Plan; and
  The introduction of the Bodycote Share Match Plan.
The Committee considers the targets set for the variable element of
Executive Directors' and senior executives' remuneration and has sought
to encourage and incentivise stretch  or exceptional and sustainable
financial performances, as measured against the Group's strategic plans.
FIXED ELEMENTS OF PAY
The fixed elements of remuneration are salaries, pensions and
other benefits.
Base salary
The base salaries for each Executive Director and senior executives
are reviewed annually and are determined by taking into account the
responsibilities and performance of the individual, having regard to
current market practice.
In line with the remuneration policy the Committee has, since 2002,
only made inflationary (and where appropriate market) adjustments
following benchmarking. The Committee has used UK engineering
businesses and FTSE 250 companies, as well as other North American
or European companies in similar trades, as comparables. This resulted
in the following salaries being set with effect from 1 January 2007:
Mr J D Hubbard  390,000
Mr D F Landless  250,000
Mr D R Sleight  190,000
Pension
Pensions for current UK domiciled Executive Directors are, up to
the UK Government salary cap, provided for under the Group's UK
contributory final salary pension scheme which has a normal
retirement age of 65 and which is closed to new members.
The main features, in respect of the Executive Directors are:
a) Pensions from age 65 of 1/60th highest average salary of any
consecutive three years out of the last ten years prior to retirement
(restricted to the earnings cap where it applies) for each year of
pensionable service, and with increases in pensionable salary after
31 December 2003 restricted to 4.25% each year ( the Salary Limit');
b) A cash death-in-service benefit of four times basic salary at date
of death;
c) Spouse or dependant's pension on member's death equal to half
member's prospective retirement pension (restricted as before)
at 65 on death in service, or half member's pension entitlement
on death in retirement;
d) Member's contributions are 7% of basic salary;
e) For Executive Directors with basic salaries above the Salary Limit
or the earnings cap the Group will contribute 14% (between
14% and 16% from 5 April 2007) of the excess to a defined
contribution arrangement.
ID3668_Bc_AR_2006_Insides_80pp_ARTWORK.qxp  27/3/07  15:33  Page 18 Bodycote annual report 2006 19
An analysis of accrued pension entitlements for the two Directors
with accruing benefits under the scheme during 2006 is given on
page 23. 
The Group proposes to amend the scheme further so that increases in
pensionable salary after 5 April 2007 are capped at 3% per annum and
so that member's contributions will increase to 8% of pensionable salary.
Arrangements for Mr Hubbard are for a contribution to a defined
contribution arrangement of between 14% and 16% of his basic
salary (including any payments being made by the Group into the
Group's US 401k retirement plan) from January 2004 onwards.
Mr Hubbard is a member of the Group's US 401K retirement plan to
which the Group contributed  8,491 (2005:  24,362). Pension
contributions for Mr Landless' salary above the earnings cap
amounted to  16,156 (2005:  15,540).
Other fixed elements
The Company provides other benefits in line with market practices.
These include the provision of a company car, private medical
insurance for the Executive Directors and their families, and
long-term disability insurance.
VARIABLE ELEMENTS OF PAY
There are essentially four variable elements of pay.
Annual Bonuses
For 2006 an annual bonus is payable to all Executive Directors and
senior executives, based on the Group and individual performance.
For those senior executives with Strategic Business Unit (SBU)
responsibilities, part of the performance-related bonus is based
on their relevant sphere of responsibility.
Payment of the maximum cash bonus for 2006 required Executive
Directors and senior executives to achieve challenging target increases
over 2005 performance in Economic Profit (40% of target achieved),
ROCE (Group return on capital employed) (42.9% achieved), organic sales
(61.1% achieved) and quantitative improvements in safety and health
(although accident severity rates improved by 8.6% the frequency and
overall targets were not achieved). As a result, Executive Directors
received a cash bonus of 21.7% of basic salary (against a maximum
of 60%) and senior executives' cash bonuses ranged from 18.5% to
37.4% depending upon individual SBU performances (again compared
to maximum of 60%).
Share Awards
In 2006, the Company introduced the Bodycote Incentive Plan (BIP)
under which Executive Directors and senior executives are rewarded
for the delivery of the Company's Strategic Plan and in particular
enhanced Economic Profit. Economic Profit for these purposes is
defined as adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), less a
15% charge per annum for the aggregate average of shareholders'
funds, net borrowings and goodwill previously written off to reserves,
amortised or impaired. To achieve the improvement in Economic
Profit both pre-tax ROCE as well as EBIT improvements have to be
made.
The Strategic Plan targets ROCE improvement by approximately one
percentage point each year until a mid-teens pre-tax ROCE performance
has been achieved. In addition significant growth in EBIT is targeted.
Based on the Group's typical capital requirements in the initial three
year performance period 2006 to 2008, maximum vesting under the
BIP will require a compound annual growth of EBIT of approximately
30%. Minimum vesting will be made for compound annual growth in
EBIT of approximately 15%. Below this level no vesting will be made.
A sliding scale will be applied to performance between the maximum,
target and minimum. Based upon the Group's Economic Profit
Performance in 2006 the Committee expects final vesting of awards
for performance in the three-year period 2006 to 2008 to be in the
mid-range of possible outcomes. As a result Executive Directors' awards
made in 2006 and that would vest in 2009 could equate to around 100%
of their basic 2005 salaries using the share price at the date of the award.
Details of the awards under the BIP are noted on page 23. 
Deferred Share Awards
In addition to the BIP , a new deferred share-matching element, which
received shareholder approval at the annual general meeting in 2006
has been introduced to provide a link between the Company's short
and long term incentive arrangements. This plan, the Bodycote Share
Match Plan (BSMP ), allows the grant of awards of matching shares
to participants on an annual basis. This will be based on the number
of shares purchased by participants with monies deferred under their
annual bonus arrangements.
This plan will first operate in 2007 by reference to the 2006 financial year
bonus. Every year, annual bonus up to the value of 20% of base salary
may be deferred into Company shares for three years. The maximum
level of matching shall be up to one share for each share deferred based
upon the achievement of a robust and challenging ROCE target.
The BSMP replaces the Deferred Restricted Stock Bonus Plan (DRSBP )
which permitted Executive Directors and senior executives to defer up
to one-third of their cash bonus payable in 2003 and 2004 for shares
to be held for three years and which the Company would then match.
It also replaces the Bodycote Short Term Stock Bonus Plan (STSBP )
which was introduced in 2005 as a temporary measure until the BIP
and BSMP could be presented to shareholders for approval. Under the
STSBP , Executive Directors and senior executives received the maximum
awards as a consequence of Bodycote being in the upper quartile of TSR
achieved by companies within the FTSE 350 Engineering & Machinery
Index and certain other comparator companies.
The shares will vest in 2009 and at the end of the holding period,
the awards will be enhanced by an amount reflecting dividends paid
on the award shares over the three-year period.
No further awards will be made under the STSBP or DRSBP following
adoption of the BIP and BSMP. Details of shares held by Directors
pursuant to the schemes noted are given on page 23.
ID3668_Bc_AR_2006_Insides_80pp_ARTWORK.qxp  27/3/07  15:33  Page 19 Option Arrangements
The Committee also reviews and manages share incentive schemes
established between 1994 and 2003. Following adoption of the BIP
no further share options will be granted to Executive Directors and
staff pursuant to the 2003 executive share option scheme, but share
options granted before this decision will continue to be capable of
exercise. At the time each scheme was approved by shareholders,
institutional guidelines were followed and latterly leading investors
were consulted.
All outstanding share options have now qualified for exercise.
Options granted since 1998 have all qualified on the basis of the
increase in headline earnings per share (EPS) since 2002 using the
UK GAAP headline EPS data for 2002 to 2004 and the IFRS headline
EPS figure for 2005. Having received and reviewed a reconciliation
between the two accounting standards (the calculations for which
have been approved by the Audit Committee), the Committee were
satisfied that each performance criterion had been met by a wide
margin.
Share options granted under the 1994 and 1996 share option schemes
were only exercisable if, over any rolling period of three years from the
date of the awarded, the growth in the Group's headline EPS exceeds
United Kingdom retail inflation by 6% (10% in respect of those options
granted in September 2002).
Under the 2003 scheme the value of shares over which options may be
granted to an executive in any one year may not normally exceed 1.5
times basic salary. The extent to which options may be exercised will
depend on the Companies growth in pre-tax EPS exceeding the growth
in the retail price index (RPI) in the three or five year period following
grant. Options over shares worth up to 0.5 times salary may be exercised
if the growth in EPS exceeds the growth in RPI by 3% per annum.
The Committee believed that the use of growth in pre-tax EPS was
at the time the most appropriate measure of the Company's financial
performance and was consistent with market practice, when adopted.
The market price of Bodycote's ordinary shares at 31 December 2006
was 228.25p, the range during 2006 was 218p to 299.25p and the
average was 246.54p. The aggregate gains made by Executive Directors
in 2006 before the impact of tax and national insurance were  123,220
for Mr Landless and  115,447 for Mr Sleight (2005: nil in each case).
An analysis of all Executive Directors' share options is given on page 22.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (TSR)
The graph on page 22 illustrates the Company's TSR performance
since 2001 relative to the FTSE All Share Industrial Index of which the
Company is a component part. This sector is considered the most
appropriate comparator group over the five year period to December
2006
The index classifications changed on 2 January 2006 and with effect
from that date the Company is included in the Industrial Machinery
sub-sector. In line with market practice the calculation for TSR assumes
reinvestment of dividends and is based on data provided by Datastream.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors have service
contracts with a one year notice period. All the Executive Directors
have service agreements which are terminable by one year's notice
by either party at any time, and by one year's remuneration in lieu of
notice by the employer, and by one year's remuneration in the event
of a change in control of the Company. Legally appropriate factors
would be taken into account to mitigate any compensation payment,
covering basic salary, annual and long term incentives and benefits,
which may arise on the termination of employment of any Executive
Director, other than payments made on a change in control or for
payments in lieu of notice. Mr Hubbard's contract is dated 5 February
2002 and those for Messrs Landless and Sleight are each dated 26
September 2001.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
The Company believes that there are benefits to the individual and
the Company for Executive Directors holding one non-executive
directorship in other organisations, provided that they do not conflict
with the Company's interests and that, provided the Executive
Director's performance is not impaired, he could retain the fees
earned in connection with such an appointment. There have been no
appointments covered by this policy.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the
Chairman and the Executive Directors. Remuneration for the Chairman
is determined by the whole board (excluding the Chairman).
Remuneration for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors takes
into account the time commitments and duties and responsibilities
involved.  The Chairman and each Non-Executive Director hold letters
of appointment for terms of three years.  Each is terminable under
the Company's articles of association, the Companies Act 1985, the
Director's resignation or otherwise on six months' notice (twelve
months in the case of the Chairman) if termination occurs before
expiry of the term.
To determine the fees it pays to Non-Executive Directors, the Board
takes into account the need to attract individuals of appropriate calibre
and expertise, the fees paid to Non-Executive Directors by other
companies of a similar size and the time commitment attached to
each appointment.  The Board keeps fees under review.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any
pension or other employment benefits or to participate in any
incentive scheme.

Executive Directors' Shareholding Retention Policy
The Committee introduced in 2005 a shareholding retention policy under which Executive Directors and other senior executives will be required,
within five years, to build up a shareholding in the Company. In respect of Executive Directors the requirement will be for their Directors'
interests in shares to be worth at least 100% of basic salary.
