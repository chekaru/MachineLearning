Board Report on Remuneration
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for remuneration
policies that create value for shareholders.
Remuneration structures and packages therefore include competitive
base salaries, a high potential for variable pay but clearly linked with
superior performance and absolute value delivered in the business,
with key business value drivers used as a basis for measuring
performance and a significant proportion of variable pay in restricted
conditional shares.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and describes how the
Board has applied the principles of the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance in relation to the remuneration of the Directors.
As required by the Remuneration Report Regulations, a resolution
to approve the Board Report on Remuneration will be proposed at
the Annual General Meeting of the Company. The Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee will be available at the Annual General
Meeting to answer questions about Directors' remuneration.
The sections of this report dealing with Directors' emoluments paid,
pensions and share options and incentives have been audited.
The remaining sections are not subject to audit.
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board the
remuneration of Executive Directors and senior executives (in all its
forms), and the terms of the service contracts and all other terms and
conditions of employment of the Executive Directors. The Committee's
full terms of reference are available on the Group's website. The members
of the Remuneration Committee during 2007 were J. Vogelsang
(Chairman), R.T. Scholes (until 16 August 2007), L.P Bermejo, J.A. Biles
(from 16 August 2007) and A.M. Thomson (from 1 December 2007).
The Committee has taken advice from Ernst & Young LLP (appointed
by the Remuneration Committee in 2006) to provide independent advice
in determining appropriate levels of remuneration. In addition, the
Company received actuarial and other pensions advice from KPMG
LLP (appointed in 2005) in relation to the management of risk arising
from the UK final salary pension scheme.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Committee aims to provide a remuneration policy consistent with
the Group's overall business objectives and thereby attract and retain
high calibre executives, align executives' rewards with the creation of
shareholder value and motivate executives to achieve and maintain
challenging levels of company and individual performance. Market rates
are determined by reference to other companies of similar size, activities
and complexity. At the same time, policy in this area is sensitive to
the remuneration structure within the Group. The Committee keeps
both the fixed and variable elements of each Executive Director's and
senior executive's overall package under review. In recent years, the
Committee has progressively increased the proportion of variable as
against fixed element of pay.
The changes introduced include: 
  Performance related annual bonus initially increased for all
executives to a maximum of 60% of base salary in 2006 and 2007
and to 80% for 2008 onwards;
  The 2003 share option scheme being replaced in 2006 by a long
term incentive plan known as the Bodycote Incentive Plan; and
  The introduction of the Bodycote Share Match Plan in 2006 with
the first awards being made in 2007.
The Committee considers the targets set for the variable element of
Executive Directors' and senior executives' remuneration and has sought
to encourage and incentivise stretch  or exceptional and sustainable
financial performances, as measured against the Group's strategic plans.
FIXED ELEMENTS OF PAY
The fixed elements of remuneration are salaries, pensions and
other benefits.
Base salary
The base salaries for Executive Directors and senior executives are
reviewed annually and are determined by taking into account the
responsibilities and performance of the individual, having regard to
current market practice.
In line with the remuneration policy the Committee has, since 2002,
only made inflationary (and where appropriate market) adjustments
following benchmarking. The Committee has used UK engineering
businesses and FTSE 250 companies, as well as other North American
or European companies in similar trades, as comparables. This resulted
in the following salaries being set with effect from 1 January 2008:
Mr J D Hubbard  405,000
Mr D F Landless  260,000
Mr D R Sleight  197,600
Pension
Pensions for current UK domiciled Executive Directors are,
up to the UK Government salary cap, provided for under the
Group's UK contributory final salary pension scheme which has a
normal retirement age of 65 and which is closed to new members.
The main features, in respect of the Executive Directors are:
a) Pensions from age 65 of 1/60th highest average salary of any
consecutive three years out of the last ten years prior to retirement
(restricted to the earnings cap where it applies) for each year of
pensionable service, and with increases in pensionable salary after
31 December 2006 restricted to 3% each year ( the Salary Limit');
b) A cash death-in-service benefit of four times basic salary at date
of death;
c) Spouse or dependant's pension on member's death equal to half
member's prospective retirement pension (restricted as before)
at 65 on death in service, or half member's pension entitlement
on death in retirement;
d) Member's contributions are 8% of basic salary; and
e) For Executive Directors with basic salaries above the Salary Limit
or the earnings cap the Group will contribute between 14% and
16% of the excess to a defined contribution arrangement.

An analysis of accrued pension entitlements for the two Directors with
accruing benefits under the scheme during 2007 is given on page 27.
Arrangements for Mr Hubbard are for a Company contribution to a
defined contribution arrangement of 16% of his basic salary (including
any payments being made by the Group into the Group's US 401k
retirement plan) from January 2007 onwards. Mr Hubbard is a member
of the Group's US 401K retirement plan to which the Group contributed
 9,488 (2006:  8,491). Pension contributions for Mr Landless' salary
above the earnings cap amounted to  20,573 (2006:  16,156).
Other fixed elements
The Company provides other benefits in line with market practices.
These include the provision of a company car, private medical
insurance for the Executive Directors and their families, and
long-term disability insurance.
VARIABLE ELEMENTS OF PAY
There are essentially four variable elements of pay.
Annual Bonuses
For 2007 an annual bonus is payable to all Executive Directors and
senior executives, based on the Group and individual performance.
For those senior executives with Strategic Business Unit (SBU)
responsibilities, part of the performance-related bonus is based on
their relevant sphere of responsibility. Payment of the maximum cash
bonus for 2007 required Executive Directors and senior executives to
achieve challenging target increases over 2006 performance in
Economic Profit (69.7% of target achieved), ROCE (Group return on
capital employed) (58.8% achieved), organic sales (fully achieved) and
quantitative improvements in safety and health (fully achieved). As a
result, Executive Directors received a cash bonus of 45.7% of basic
salary (against a maximum of 60%) and senior executives' cash
bonuses ranged from 11.8% to 51.8% depending upon individual
SBU performances (again compared to maximum of 60%). Executive
Directors and senior executives with SBU responsibilities will have
the potential to receive annual cash bonus awards of up to 80% of
base salary for 2008 onwards.
Share Awards
In 2006, the Company introduced the Bodycote Incentive Plan (BIP)
under which Executive Directors and senior executives are rewarded
for the delivery of the Company's Strategic Plan and in particular
enhanced Economic Profit. Economic Profit for these purposes is
defined as adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), less a
15% charge per annum for the aggregate average of shareholders'
funds, net borrowings and goodwill previously written off to reserves,
amortised or impaired. To achieve the improvement in Economic Profit
both pre-tax ROCE as well as EBIT improvements have to be made.
The Strategic Plan targets ROCE improvement by approximately one
percentage point each year until a mid-teens pre-tax ROCE performance
has been achieved. In addition significant growth in EBIT is targeted.
Based on the Group's typical capital requirements in the initial three
year performance period 2006 to 2008, maximum vesting under the
BIP will require a compound annual growth of EBIT of approximately
30%. Minimum vesting will be made for compound annual growth in
EBIT of approximately 15%. Below this level no vesting will be made.
A sliding scale will be applied to performance between the maximum,
target and minimum. Based upon the Group's Economic Profit
Performance in 2006 and 2007 the Committee expects final vesting
of awards for performance in the three-year periods 2006 to 2008 and
2007 to 2009 to be in the mid-range of possible outcomes. As a result
Executive Directors' awards made in 2006 and 2007 and that would
vest in 2009 or 2010 respectively could equate to around 100% of
their basic 2005 or 2006 salaries (as applicable) using the share price
at the date of the award. Details of the awards under the BIP are
noted on page 26.
Deferred Share Awards
In addition to the BIP, a new deferred share-matching element, which
received shareholder approval at the annual general meeting in 2006,
has been introduced to provide a link between the Company's short
and long term incentive arrangements. This plan, the Bodycote Share
Match Plan (BSMP ), allows the grant of awards of matching shares
to participants on an annual basis. This will be based on the number
of shares purchased by participants with the gross amount of monies
deferred under their annual bonus arrangements.
This plan first operated in 2007 by reference to the 2006 financial
year bonus. Every year, annual bonus up to the value of 20% of
base salary may be deferred into Company shares for three years.
The maximum level of matching shall be calculated by reference to
the gross bonus deferral on a one for one basis subject to the
achievement of a robust and challenging ROCE target.
Details of the awards under the BSMP are noted on page 27.
The BSMP replaces the Deferred Restricted Stock Bonus Plan
(DRSBP ) which permitted Executive Directors and senior executives
to defer up to one-third of their cash bonus payable in 2003 and 2004
for shares to be held for three years and which the Company would
then match. It also replaces the Bodycote Short Term Stock Bonus
Plan (STSBP ) which was introduced in 2005 as a temporary measure
until the BIP and BSMP could be presented to shareholders for approval.
Under the STSBP, Executive Directors and senior executives received
the maximum awards as a consequence of Bodycote being in the
upper quartile of TSR achieved by companies within the FTSE 350
Engineering & Machinery Index and certain other comparator companies.
The shares will vest in 2009 and at the end of the holding period, the
awards will be enhanced by an amount reflecting dividends paid on
the award shares over the three-year period. No further awards will
be made under the STSBP or DRSBP following adoption of the BIP
and BSMP. Details of shares held by Directors pursuant to the
schemes noted are given on page 26.
ID4157_Bc_AR_2007_Insides_80pp_04.qxp  6/3/08  15:20  Page 23 Option Arrangements
The Committee also manages share incentive schemes established
between 1994 and 2003. Following adoption of the BIP no further
share options will be granted to Executive Directors and staff
pursuant to the 2003 executive share option scheme, but share
options granted before this decision will continue to be capable of
exercise. At the time each scheme was approved by shareholders,
institutional guidelines were followed and latterly leading investors
were consulted.
All outstanding share options have now qualified for exercise.
Options granted since 1998 have all qualified on the basis of the
increase in headline earnings per share (EPS) since 2002 using the
UK GAAP headline EPS data for 2002 to 2004 and the IFRS headline
EPS figure for 2005. Having received and reviewed a reconciliation
between the two accounting standards (the calculations for which have
been approved by the Audit Committee), the Committee were satisfied
that each performance criterion had been met by a wide margin.
Share options granted under the 1994 and 1996 share option schemes
were only exercisable if, over any rolling period of three years from the
date of the award, the growth in the Group's headline EPS exceeds
United Kingdom retail inflation by 6% (10% in respect of those options
granted in September 2002).
Under the 2003 scheme the value of shares over which options may be
granted to an executive in any one year may not normally exceed 1.5
times basic salary. The extent to which options may be exercised will
depend on the Company's growth in pre-tax EPS exceeding the growth
in the retail price index (RPI) in the three or five year period following
grant. Options over shares worth up to 0.5 times salary may be exercised
if the growth in EPS exceeds the growth in RPI by 3% per annum.
The Committee believed that the use of growth in pre-tax EPS was
at the time the most appropriate measure of the Company's financial
performance and was consistent with market practice, when adopted.
The market price of Bodycote's ordinary shares at 31 December 2007
was 186.75p, the range during 2007 was 176p to 325p and the average
was 273p. The aggregate gains made by Executive Directors in 2007
before the impact of tax and national insurance were  27,442 for
Mr Landless (2006:  123,220) and nil for Mr Sleight (2006:  115,447).
An analysis of all Executive Directors' share options is given on page 26.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (TSR)
The graph on page 27 illustrates the Company's TSR performance since
2002 relative to the FTSE All Share Industrial Index of which the Company
is a component part. This sector is considered the most appropriate
comparator group over the five year period to December 2007.
In line with market practice the calculation for TSR assumes reinvestment
of dividends and is based on data provided by Datastream.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors have service
contracts with a one year notice period. All the Executive Directors
have service agreements which are terminable by one year's notice
by the employer at any time, and by one year's remuneration in lieu
of notice by the employer, and by one year's remuneration in the
event of a change in control of the Company. Legally appropriate
factors would be taken into account to mitigate any compensation
payment, covering basic salary, annual and long term incentives and
benefits, which may arise on the termination of employment of any
Executive Director, other than payments made on a change in control
or for payments in lieu of notice. Mr Hubbard's contract is dated 5
February 2002 and those for Messrs Landless and Sleight are each
dated 26 September 2001.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
The Company believes that there are benefits to the individual
and the Company for Executive Directors holding one non-executive
directorship in other organisations, provided that they do not conflict
with the Company's interests and that, provided the Executive Director's
performance is not impaired, he could retain the fees earned in
connection with such an appointment. There have been no
appointments covered by this policy.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the
Chairman and the Executive Directors. Remuneration for the Chairman
is determined by the whole board (excluding the Chairman).
Remuneration for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors takes
into account the time commitments and duties and responsibilities
involved. The Chairman and each Non-Executive Director hold letters
of appointment for terms of three years (or 41 months in respect of
the new deputy chairman). Each is terminable under the Company's
articles of association, the Companies Act 1985, the Director's
resignation or otherwise on six months' notice (twelve months
in the case of the Chairman or deputy chairman) if termination
occurs before expiry of the term.
To determine the fees it pays to Non-Executive Directors, the Board
takes into account the need to attract individuals of appropriate calibre
and expertise, the fees paid to Non-Executive Directors by other
companies of a similar size and the time commitment attached to each
appointment. The Board keeps fees under review. The Chairman and
Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any pension or other
employment benefits or to participate in any incentive scheme.

Executive Directors' Shareholding Retention Policy
The Committee introduced in 2005 a shareholding retention policy under which Executive Directors and other senior executives will be required,
within five years, to build up a shareholding in the Company. In respect of Executive Directors the requirement will be for their Directors'
interests in shares to be worth at least 100% of basic salary.
