 22 Bodycote annual report 2008
Board Report on Remuneration
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for remuneration policies
that aim to create value for shareholders. 
Remuneration structures and packages therefore include competitive
basic salaries, a high potential for variable pay but clearly linked with
superior performance and absolute value delivered in the business, with
key business value drivers used as a basis for measuring performance
and a significant proportion of variable pay in restricted conditional shares.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Combined
Code, Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and the UK Listing
Authority Listing Rules. 
Shareholders will be given the opportunity to approve the report
at the Annual General Meeting. The Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee will be available at the Annual General Meeting to answer
questions about Directors' remuneration. 
The sections of this report dealing with Directors' emoluments paid,
pensions and share options and incentives have been audited.
The remaining sections are not subject to audit.
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Committee is responsible for the remuneration of Executive
Directors and senior executives (in all its forms), and the terms of the
service contracts and all other terms and conditions of employment
of the Executive Directors. 
The Committee's full terms of reference are available on the Group's
website. The members of the Remuneration Committee during 2008
were Messrs J. Vogelsang (Chairman), L.P Bermejo (retired 29 February
2008), J.A. Biles, A.M. Thomson and Dr K. Rajagopal (appointed on the
recommendation of the nomination committee on 24 September 2008).
During the year, the Committee has taken independent advice from
Ernst & Young LLP in determining appropriate levels of remuneration.
In addition, the Company received actuarial and other pensions advice
from KPMG LLP and Deloitte LLP concerning the management of risk
arising from the UK final salary pension scheme as well as advising on
the pension implications arising from the disposal of the Testing business.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Committee aims to provide a remuneration policy consistent
with the Group's overall business objectives and thereby attract
and retain high calibre executives, align executives' rewards with the
creation of shareholder value and motivate executives to achieve and
maintain challenging levels of company and individual performance.
Market rates are determined by reference to other companies of
similar size, activities and complexity. At the same time, policy in
this area is sensitive to the remuneration structure within the Group.
The Committee keeps both the fixed and variable elements of each
Executive Director's and senior executive's overall package under
review. In recent years, the Committee has progressively increased
the proportion of variable as against fixed element of pay, and for
2009 will increase the maximum potential for annual cash bonuses to
100% of basic salaries for executive directors and senior executives.
The Committee also considers the targets set for the variable element
of Executive Directors' and senior executives' remuneration and has
sought to encourage and incentivise stretch  or exceptional and
sustainable financial performance.
FIXED ELEMENTS OF PAY
The fixed elements of remuneration are salaries, pensions and
other benefits.
Basic salary
The basic salaries for each Executive Director and senior executives
are reviewed annually by the Committee and are determined by taking
into account the responsibilities and performance of the individual,
having regard to current market practice. In line with the remuneration
policy the Committee has, since 2002, only made inflationary (and
where appropriate market) adjustments following benchmarking.
The Committee has used UK engineering businesses and FTSE 250
companies, as well as other North American or European companies
in similar trades, as comparables. 
Pension 
Pensions for UK domiciled Executive Directors appointed prior to
April 2001 are provided for under the Group's UK contributory final
salary pension scheme which has a normal retirement age of 65
and which is closed to new members. 
Since April 2007 increases in pensionable salaries have been capped
at 3% per annum for all non-senior members (as defined in the rules)
of the scheme. For senior members in the scheme the increase in
pensionable salaries has been capped since 1 January 2004 (with the
cap since 5 April 2007 being set as 3% per annum) unless otherwise
restricted by the UK Government's Earnings Cap. The Finance Act
2004 removed the Earnings Cap and therefore the Group agreed that
it should no longer apply and in its place the scheme specific salary
cap (the  Salary Limit') would apply (albeit respectively from 1 January
2004) to any affected members. For members with basic salaries
above the Salary Limit, the Group will contribute between 14% and
16% of the excess to a defined contribution arrangement.
The main features, in respect of the Executive Directors are:
a) Pensions from age 65 of 1/60th highest average salary of any
consecutive three years out of the last ten years prior to retirement
for each year of pensionable service, and with increases in
pensionable salary after 31 December 2006 restricted to 3%
each year ( the Salary Limit');
b) A cash death-in-service benefit of four times basic salary at date
of death;
c) Spouse or dependant's pension on member's death equal to half
member's prospective retirement pension (restricted as before)
at 65 on death in service, or half member's pension entitlement
on death in retirement;
d) Member's contributions are 8% of basic salary; and
e) For Executive Directors with basic salaries above the Salary Limit
or the earnings cap the Group will contribute between 14% and
16% of the excess to a defined contribution arrangement.
An analysis of accrued pension entitlements for the two Directors
with accruing benefits under the final salary scheme during 2008 is
given on page 27.
ID4530_Bc_AR_2008_Insides_88pp_05.qxp  16/3/09  16:19  Page 22 Bodycote annual report 2008 23
Arrangements for Mr Hubbard are for a contribution to a defined
contribution arrangement of 16% of his basic salary (including
any payments being made by the Group into the Group's US 401k
retirement plan) from January 2007 onwards. Pension contributions
for Mr Landless' salary above the Salary Limit amounted to  40,508
(2007:  20,573), which included an additional payment of approximately
 18,000 to allow for the retrospective impact of removing the UK
Government's earnings cap from the UK contributory final salary
scheme, and for Mr Sleight amounted to  2,328 (2007: Nil).
Mr Harris joined the Group's defined contribution arrangement from
1 November 2008 and the Group will contribute 22% of Mr Harris' basic
salary. Mr Harris will be entitled, in addition, to a cash death-in-service
benefit of eight times basic salary at the date of death.
Other fixed elements
The Company provides other benefits in line with market practices.
These include the provision of a company car (or an allowance in
lieu), private medical insurance for the Executive Directors and their
families, relocation assistance where appropriate, and long-term
disability insurance.
VARIABLE ELEMENTS OF PAY
There are essentially four variable elements of pay.
Annual Bonuses
For 2008 an annual bonus is payable to all Executive Directors and
senior executives, based on the Group and individual performance.
For those senior executives with Strategic Business Unit (SBU)
responsibilities, part of the performance-related bonus is based
on their relevant sphere of responsibility. 
Payment of the maximum cash bonus for 2008 required Executive
Directors and senior executives to achieve challenging target increases
over 2007 performance in Economic Profit (target fully achieved),
ROCE (Group return on capital employed) (fully achieved), organic
sales (not achieved) and quantitative improvements in safety and
health (fully achieved). As a result, Executive Directors received
a cash bonus of 70% of basic salary (against a maximum of 80%)
and senior executives' cash bonuses ranged from 20% to 35.9%
depending upon individual SBU performances (again compared to
maximum of 80%). 
Share Awards
Bodycote Incentive Plan (BIP )
The Company operates the BIP under which Executive Directors and
senior executives are rewarded for the delivery of the Company's
Strategic Plan and in particular enhanced Economic Profit. Economic
Profit for these purposes is defined as adjusted earnings before
interest and tax (EBIT), less a 15% charge per annum for the
aggregate average of shareholders' funds, net borrowings and
goodwill previously written off to reserves, amortised or impaired.
To achieve the improvement in Economic Profit both pre-tax ROCE
as well as EBIT improvements have to be made.
The Strategic Plan targets ROCE improvement by approximately one
percentage point each year until a mid-teens pre-tax ROCE performance
has been achieved. In addition significant growth in EBIT is targeted.
Maximum vesting under the BIP will require a compound annual
growth of EBIT of approximately 30%. Minimum vesting will be
made for compound annual growth in EBIT of approximately 15%.
Below this level no vesting will be made. A sliding scale will be
applied to performance between the maximum, target and minimum.
As a result of the economic profit performance of the Group in 2008,
it is expected, subject to satisfactory fulfilment of any remaining
qualification criteria, that a significant proportion of the BIP awards
made in 2006 will vest as shares in May 2009. Details of the awards
under the BIP are noted on page 26.
Deferred Share Awards
Bodycote Share Match Plan (BSMP )
The Company operates the BSMP which provides a link between the
Company's short and long term incentive arrangements. The BSMP
allows the grant of awards of matching shares to participants on an
annual basis. This will be based on the number of shares purchased
by participants with the gross amount of monies deferred under their
annual bonus arrangements. 
Under the terms of the plan, annual bonus up to the value of 20%
of base salary may be deferred into Company shares for three years.
The maximum level of matching shall be calculated by reference
to the gross bonus deferral on a one to one basis, subject to the
achievement of a robust and challenging ROCE target. Details of
the awards under the BSMP are noted on page 27. 
The Bodycote Short Term Stock Bonus Plan (STSBP )
The BSMP also replaced the STSBP which was introduced in 2005
as a temporary measure until the BIP and BSMP could be presented
to shareholders for approval. Under the STSBP , Executive Directors and
senior executives received the maximum awards as a consequence
of Bodycote being in the upper quartile of TSR achieved by companies
within the FTSE 350 Engineering & Machinery Index and certain other
comparator companies. The shares will vest in March 2009 and at the
end of the holding period, the awards will be enhanced by an amount
reflecting dividends paid on the award shares over the three-year
period. No further awards will be made under the STSBP following
the introduction of the BIP and BSMP. Details of shares held by
Directors pursuant to the schemes noted are given on page 26.
Deferred Restricted Stock Bonus Plan (DRSBP )
The BSMP also replaced the DRSBP which permitted Executive
Directors and senior executives to defer up to one-third of their cash
bonus payable in 2003 and 2004 for shares to be held for three years
and which the Company would then match. No further awards will
be made under the DRSBP following the introduction of the BIP and
BSMP. Details of shares held by Directors pursuant to the plan are
given on page 26.
Option Arrangements
The Committee also reviews and manages share incentive schemes
established between 1994 and 2003. Following adoption of the BIP
no further share options have been granted to Executive Directors
and staff pursuant to the 2003 executive share option scheme, but
share options granted before this decision will continue to be capable
of exercise. At the time each scheme was approved by shareholders,
institutional guidelines were followed and latterly leading investors
were consulted. All outstanding share options are now capable of
exercise because the relevant performance criteria were achieved. 
ID4530_Bc_AR_2008_Insides_88pp_05.qxp  16/3/09  16:19  Page 23 The market price of Bodycote's ordinary shares at 31 December 2008
was 123p, the range during 2008 was 99.44p to 261.44p and the
average was 193.59p. The aggregate notional gain made by John
Hubbard, the only executive director to have exercised any share
options in 2008, before the impact of tax and national insurance was
 54,390 for Mr Hubbard. An analysis of all Executive Directors' share
options is given on page 26.
Arrangements relating to the appointment of Mr Stephen Harris
On the 1 November 2008 Mr Stephen Harris joined the Board as Chief
Executive Officer Designate in preparation for taking on the role of
Chief Executive Officer from John Hubbard in January 2009.
In accordance with Rule 9.4.2(2) of the Listing Rules, an arrangement
was made to facilitate the recruitment of Stephen Harris ( Joining
Award'). As part of the committee's policy to fully align the interests of
the new Chief Executive Officer with those of Bodycote's shareholders,
Mr Harris was invited to deposit share certificates for Bodycote plc
shares which he purchased (before commission and stamp duty) out
of his own funds with the Company Secretary ( Deferred Shares').
The 145,474 Deferred Shares acquired on 20 October 2008 and
7 November 2008 will be treated as if they were purchased under
the BSMP and the Joining Award will replicate a  Matching Award'
under the BSMP (for example, as to continued employment with
Bodycote, the maximum number of shares that may be awarded and
the achievement of robust and challenging ROCE targets over the
next three financial years). The Joining Award will not be pensionable.
The Committee believe these arrangements reinforce the link between
the chief executive's remuneration and the creation of value for all
shareholders which is a key part of the Bodycote remuneration policy.
IMPACT OF THE DISPOSAL AND RETURN OF CASH
Participants under the Bodycote share incentive arrangements are not
the beneficial owners of the shares and so were unable to participate
in the Return of Cash (other than where they are required to make an
investment in Bodycote shares under the terms of the relevant scheme).
The Board determined that no adjustment should be made to their
options and awards as the 11 for 19 share capital consolidation had
the effect of maintaining the value of these options and awards,
subject to normal market fluctuations. Following the 11 for 19 share
capital consolidation, all such participants remained entitled to receive
the same number of shares on exercise of their options and or vesting
of their awards as under their previous entitlement. Participants in
the BSMP as well as the Joining Award made to Mr Stephen Harris
noted above, who are required to make an investment in shares
(Deferred Shares) as a condition to the grant of a matching award,
were entitled to participate in the Return of Cash in respect of their
Deferred Shares. The remuneration committee has also determined
it is appropriate to adjust the performance targets attaching to the BIP
and BSMP awards made in 2007 and 2008 to reflect the fact the size
of the business has been reduced following the disposal of the
Testing Unit.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (TSR)
The graph on page 27 illustrates the Company's TSR performance
since 2003 relative to the FTSE All Share Industrial Index of which the
Company is a component part. This sector is considered the most
appropriate comparator group over the five year period to December
2008. In line with market practice the calculation for TSR assumes
reinvestment of dividends and is based on data provided by Datastream.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors have service
contracts with a one year notice period. All the Executive Directors
have service agreements which are terminable by one year's notice
by the employer at any time, and by one year's remuneration in lieu
of notice by the employer, and by one year's remuneration in the event
of a change in control of the Company (save for Mr Harris where the
change of control provision does not apply). Legally appropriate factors
would be taken into account to mitigate any compensation payment,
covering basic salary, annual incentives and benefits, which may arise
on the termination of employment of any Executive Director, other
than payments made on a change in control or for payments in lieu
of notice. Mr Harris' service agreement is dated 6 October 2008,
Mr Hubbard's contract is dated 5 February 2002 and those for
Messrs Landless and Sleight are each dated 26 September 2001. 
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
The Company believes that there are benefits to the individual and
the Company for Executive Directors holding one non-executive
directorship in other organisations, provided that they do not conflict
with the Company's interests and that, provided the Executive
Director's performance is not impaired, he could retain the fees
earned in connection with such an appointment. 
The total amount of fees earned in the financial year (from the date
of his appointment) by Mr Harris in respect of his non-executive
directorship with Brixton plc was  6,333.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the
Chairman and the Executive Directors. Remuneration for the Chairman
is determined by the whole board (excluding the Chairman).
Remuneration for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors takes
into account the time commitments and duties and responsibilities
involved. The Chairman and each Non-Executive Director hold letters
of appointment for terms of three years (or 41 months in respect of
the chairman). Each is terminable under the Company's articles of
association, the Companies Act 1985, the Director's resignation or
otherwise on six months' notice (twelve months in the case of the
Chairman) if termination occurs before expiry of the term. 
To determine the fees it pays to Non-Executive Directors, the Board
takes into account the need to attract individuals of appropriate
calibre and expertise, the fees paid to Non-Executive Directors by
other companies of a similar size and the time commitment attached
to each appointment. The Board keeps fees under review. The Chairman
and Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any pension or other
employment benefits or to participate in any incentive scheme.

Executive Directors' Shareholding Retention Policy
The committee introduced in 2005 a shareholding retention policy under which Executive Directors and other senior executives will be required,
within five years, to build up a shareholding in the Company.  In respect of Executive Directors the requirement will be for their Directors'
interests in shares to be worth at least 100% of basic salary.
