 46 BODYCOTE ANNUAL REPORT 2009    BUSINESS REVIEW : CORPORATE GOVERNANCE : ACCOUNTS
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for remuneration policies
that aim to create value for shareholders. 
Remuneration structures and packages therefore include competitive
basic salaries, a high potential for variable pay that is clearly linked with
superior performance and absolute value delivered in the business,
with key business value drivers used as a basis for measuring performance
and a significant proportion of variable pay in restricted conditional shares.
This report sets out the policy and disclosures on Directors' remuneration
as required by the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 issued under the Companies
Act 2006 (the  Act'), the Listing Rules and the Combined Code, in
accordance with the Act, a resolution to approve this report will be
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company.
The vote will have advisory status in respect of the remuneration
policy and overall remuneration packages and will not be specific to
individual levels of remuneration. The Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee will be available at the Annual General Meeting to answer
questions about Directors' remuneration. 
The sections of this report dealing with Directors' emoluments
paid, pensions and share options and incentives have been audited.
The remaining sections are not subject to audit.
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Committee determines the remuneration of Executive Directors
and senior executives, and the terms of the service contracts and all
other terms and conditions of employment of the Executive Directors. 
The Committee's full terms of reference are available on the Group's
website. The members of the Remuneration Committee during
2009 were J. Vogelsang (Chairman), J.A. Biles, A.M. Thomson and
Dr K. Rajagopal. During the year, the Committee has taken advice
from Ernst & Y oung LLP to provide independent advice on remuneration.
In addition, the Company received actuarial and other pensions advice
from KPMG LLP in relation to the management of risk arising from
the UK final salary pension scheme.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest (other than
as shareholders), conflict of interest, cross-directorships or day-to-day
involvement in the running of the Business.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Committee aims to provide a remuneration policy consistent
with the Group's overall business strategy and thereby attract and
retain high calibre executives, align executives' rewards with the
creation of shareholder value and motivate executives to achieve and
maintain challenging levels of company and individual performance.
Market rates are determined by reference to other companies of
similar size, activities and complexity. At the same time, policy in
this area is sensitive to the remuneration structure within the Group.
The Committee keeps both the fixed and variable elements of each
Executive Director's and senior executive's overall package under
review. In recent years, the Committee has progressively increased
the proportion of variable as opposed to fixed element of pay, so that
currently the total potential from variable performance related pay is
now substantially in excess of basic pay. 
The Committee also considers the targets set for the variable element
of Executive Directors' and senior executives' remuneration which
at all times aim to encourage appropriate behaviours and deliver
exceptional and sustainable financial performance measured against
the Group's strategic plans. With this in mind, during the year the
Committee conducted a review of the long-term incentive arrangements
last amended in 2006 as the business is now significantly different
to when the Bodycote Incentive Plan ( BIP') and the Bodycote Share
Match Plan ( BSMP') were first introduced. Following the review
it was decided to:
undertake a period of consultation with major shareholders
on what the Committee considered to be the most appropriate
performance conditions for future awards under the BIP, more
detail on which is included in the section headed Bodycote
Incentive Plan; and
propose changes to the current structure of the BSMP so
as to (i) permit executives to make additional contributions
out of their own monies (up to 40% of their base salary) and
(ii) change the performance conditions to be applied to the
matching awards. The necessary amendments to the BSMP
are to be put to shareholders for approval at the Annual General
Meeting and are set out below and in the notice of meeting
sent to shareholders with this annual report.

FIXED ELEMENTS OF PAY
The fixed elements of remuneration are salaries, pensions
and other benefits.
Basic salary
The basic salaries for each Executive Director and the senior executives
are reviewed annually by the Committee and are determined by taking
into account the responsibilities and performance of the individual,
having regard to current market practice. In the light of the difficult
economic conditions and historic low level of inflation the Committee
has decided in consultation with the Executive Directors that there
will be no increase in basic salaries in 2010 for Executive Directors.
Pension 
The Committee reviews the pension arrangements for the Executive
Directors to ensure that the benefits provided are consistent with
those provided by other similar companies.
Mr Harris joined the Group's defined contribution arrangement
from 1 November 2008 and receives contributions from the Group
at a rate of 22% of basic salary. In addition, in the event of death a
death-in-service benefit of eight times basic salary will become payable.
The pension for Mr Landless is provided under the Group's UK
contributory defined benefit pension scheme which has a normal
retirement age of 65 and which is closed to new members. Increases
in his pensionable salary are capped under this scheme at 3% per
annum. As a consequence Mr Landless receives an additional
contribution of 16% of salary to a defined contribution arrangement.
The defined benefit scheme also provides lump sum death-in-service
benefits and pension benefits based on final pensionable salary.
Arrangements for Mr Hubbard, who retired as a Director on 27 April
2009 were for a contribution to a defined contribution arrangement
of 16% of his basic salary (including any payments being made by
the Group into the Group's US 401k retirement plan) from January
2007 to April 2009.
An analysis of the accrued pension entitlements for Mr Landless
under the final salary scheme during 2009 is given on page 53.
Other fixed elements
The Company provides other benefits in line with market practices.
These include the provision of a company car (or an allowance in lieu),
private medical insurance for the Executive Directors and their families,
relocation assistance where appropriate, and long-term disability insurance.
VARIABLE ELEMENTS OF PAY
There are essentially three variable elements of pay.
Annual bonuses
As a consequence of the unprecedented economic uncertainty that
began in late 2008 and continued into 2009, Group profits in 2009
fell a long way short of budget and 2008 profits, so the Committee
took the decision that in 2009 a bonus would only be payable to the
Executive Directors and senior executives in respect of performance
against safety measures up to a maximum of 10% of basic pay.
As a result, each of the Executive Directors received a cash bonus
of 5% of basic salary.
The Committee's intention is that for 2010 an annual bonus of up
to 100% of basic salary will be payable to all Executive Directors
and senior executives, subject to meeting targets based upon Group
and individual performance. For those senior executives with divisional
responsibilities, part of the performance-related bonus is based on
their relevant sphere of responsibility.
Share awards
Bodycote Incentive Plan ( BIP')
The Company operates the BIP under which Executive Directors and
senior executives are rewarded for the delivery of the Company's
strategic plan. As a result of the business now being significantly
different in terms of size, focus and strategy since the BIP was first
introduced, the Committee informally consulted shareholders during
the year regarding changes to the performance measures that they
believed should apply to future BIP awards. Following the consultation,
awards will be based upon two performance measures, over a three
year period:
half of the award will be subject to a return on capital
employed ( ROCE') performance condition; and
half of the award will be subject to an earnings per share
( EPS') performance condition.
Each of the measures is to be calculated independently and failure
to achieve a pre-determined minimum EPS level will mean that no
part of the award will vest. A sliding scale will apply between minimum
and maximum levels.
For awards made in previous years, the performance targets will
not change and vesting of awards will remain subject to an economic
profit target. 
Following completion of the performance period, the Remuneration
Committee has determined that none of the BIP awards made in
2007 shall vest.

BOARD REPORT ON REMUNERATION

Deferred share awards
Bodycote Share Match Plan ( BSMP')
The Company operates the BSMP which provides a link between
the Company's short and long-term incentive arrangements.
The BSMP allows the grant of awards of matching shares to
participants on an annual basis. Under the existing terms of the plan,
annual bonus up to the value of 20% of base salary may be deferred
into Company shares for three years. 
Under the BSMP, the maximum level of matching is calculated by
reference to the gross bonus deferral on a one to one basis subject
to the achievement of a robust and challenging ROCE target. Details
of the awards under the BSMP are noted on page 52. This includes
details of the joining award made to S.C. Harris in October 2008 which
is subject to the same performance criteria as the other awards made
under the BSMP. 
Following completion of the performance period, the Remuneration
Committee has determined that none of the share match awards made
in 2007 shall vest.
Shareholder approval is being sought to allow participants to purchase
additional shares for deferral from salary or other monies to bring their
overall annual contribution up to a total amount equal to 40% of their
base salary, subject to annual Remuneration Committee approval.
The Committee intends to allow such a level of investment in 2010
subject to shareholder approval of the new matching plan.
For the matching awards to be made in 2010, it is proposed that
whilst the level of match will be the same, subject to shareholder
approval, the ROCE performance condition will be replaced with
an absolute Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measure (i.e. share price
plus dividends). 
Historic arrangements
In addition to the above, the following are legacy plans which
were superseded by the BIP and BSMP in 2006.
The Bodycote Short Term Stock Bonus Plan ( STSBP')
Under the STSBP, Executive Directors and senior executives
received the maximum awards as a consequence of Bodycote
in 2005 being in the upper quartile of TSR achieved by companies
within the FTSE 350 Engineering & Machinery Index and certain
other comparator companies. The shares that constitute this award
vested in March 2009 at the end of the holding period, and the awards
were enhanced by an amount reflecting dividends paid on the award
shares over the three-year period. No further awards will be made
under the STSBP following the introduction of the BIP and BSMP. 
Details of the shares awarded to Directors under the STSBP are
noted on page 51.
Option Arrangements
The Committee also manages share incentive schemes established
between 1994 and 2003. Following adoption of the BIP no further
share options have been granted to Executive Directors and staff
pursuant to the 2003 executive share option scheme, but share
options granted before this decision will continue to be capable of
exercise. At the time each scheme was approved by shareholders,
institutional guidelines were followed and latterly leading investors
were consulted. All outstanding share options are now capable of
exercise because the relevant performance criteria were achieved. 
The market price of Bodycote's ordinary shares at 31 December 2009
was  1.59, the range during 2009 was  1.04 to  1.98 and the average
was  1.45. Details of the outstanding share options granted to
D. F. Landless are provided on page 51.
ID4874_Bc_AR2009_14.qxp  5/3/10  16:09  Page 48 BUSINESS REVIEW : CORPORATE GOVERNANCE : ACCOUNTS BODYCOTE ANNUAL REPORT 2009 49
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (TSR)
The graph on page 53 illustrates the Company's TSR performance
since 2004 relative to the FTSE All Share Industrial Index of which
the Company is a component part. This sector is considered the most
appropriate comparator group over the five-year period to December
2009. In line with market practice the calculation for TSR assumes
reinvestment of dividends and is based on data provided by Datastream.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors have service
contracts with a one-year notice period. All the Executive Directors
have service agreements which are terminable by one year's
notice by the employer at any time, and by payment of one year's
remuneration in lieu of notice by the employer, and by one year's
remuneration in the event of a change in control of the Company
(save for Mr Harris where the change of control provision does not
apply). Legally appropriate factors would be taken into account to
mitigate any compensation payment, covering basic salary, annual
incentives and benefits, which may arise on the termination of
employment of any Executive Director, other than payments made
on a change in control or for payments in lieu of notice. Mr Harris'
service agreement is dated 6 October 2008 and Mr Landless'
contract is dated 26 September 2001. 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' SHAREHOLDING RETENTION POLICY
In 2005 the Committee introduced a shareholding retention
policy under which Executive Directors and other senior executives
are required, within five years of that date or commencement of
employment if later, to build up a shareholding in the Company.
In respect of Executive Directors the requirement is to hold at least
100% of basic salary.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
The Company believes that there are benefits to the individual
and the Company for Executive Directors holding one non-executive
directorship in another organisation, provided that they do not conflict
with the Company's interests. Provided the Executive Director's
performance is not impaired, he can retain the fees earned in
connection with such an appointment. 
In the financial year, Mr Harris earned  25,333 from one
external appointment. 
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of Non-executive Directors is determined by
the Chairman and the Executive Directors. Remuneration for the
Chairman is determined by the whole Board (excluding the Chairman).
Remuneration for the Chairman and Non-executive Directors takes
into account the time commitments and duties and responsibilities
involved. The Chairman and each Non-executive Director hold letters
of appointment for terms of three years (or 41 months in respect
of the Chairman). Each is terminable under the Company's Articles
of Association, the Act, the Director's resignation or otherwise on
six months' notice (twelve months in the case of the Chairman)
if termination occurs before expiry of the term. 
To determine the fees it pays to Non-executive Directors, the Board
takes into account the need to attract individuals of appropriate
calibre and expertise, the fees paid to Non-executive Directors
by other companies of a similar size and the time commitment
attached to each appointment. The Board keeps fees under review.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors are not entitled to any
pension or other employment benefits or to participate in any
incentive scheme. 
Approved by the Board:
