board	 report	 on	reMuneration
the	remuneration	Committee	 is	 responsible	 for	 remuneration	
policies	 that	 aim	 to	 create	 value	 for	 shareholders.	
r emuneration	 structures	 and	 packages	 therefore	 include	 competitive	
basic	 salaries,	 a	 high	 potential	 for	 variable	 pay	 that	 is	 clearly	 linked	
with	 superior	 performance	 and	 absolute	 value	 delivered	 in	 the	
business,	 with	 key	 business	 value	 drivers	 used	 as	 a	 basis	 for	
measuring	 performance	 and	 a	 significant	 proportion	 of	 variable	
pay	 in	 conditional	 shares.
this	report	 sets	 out	 the	 policy	 and	 disclosures	 on	directors'	
remuneration	 as	 required	 by	 the	large	 and	 Medium-sized	 Companies	
and	 Groups	 (accounts	and	reports)	regulations	2008	 issued	 under	
the	 Companies	act	 2006	 (the	  act').	in	 accordance	 with	 the	act,	 a	
resolution	 to	 approve	 this	 report	 will	 be	 proposed	 at	 the	 forthcoming	
annual	General	 Meeting	 of	 the	 Company.	the	 vote	 will	 have	 advisory	
status	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 remuneration	 policy	 and	 overall	 remuneration	
packages	 and	 will	 not	 be	 specific	 to	 individual	 levels	 of	 remuneration.	
the	Chairman	 of	 the	remuneration	 Committee	 will	 be	 available	 at	
the	annual	 General	 Meeting	 to	 answer	 questions	 about	directors'	
remuneration.	
the	sections	 of	 this	 report	 dealing	 with	directors'	 emoluments	
paid,	 pensions	 and	 share	 options	 and	 incentives	 have	 been	 audited.	
the	remaining	 sections	 are	 not	 subject	 to	 audit.
the	remuneration	 Committee
t he	 Committee	 determines	 the	 remuneration	 of	e xecutive	directors	
and	 senior	 executives,	 and	 the	 terms	 of	 the	 service	 contracts	 and	 all	
other	 terms	 and	 conditions	 of	 employment	 of	 the	e xecutive	directors.	
t he	 Committee's	 full	 terms	 of	 reference	 are	 available	 on	 the	 Group's	
website.	the	 members	 of	 the	remuneration	 Committee	 during	
2010	 were	j.	vogelsang	 (Chairman),	j.a.	biles,	a.M.	thomson	 and	
d r	 K.	rajagopal.	during	 the	 year,	 the	 Committee	 has	 taken	 advice	
from	e rnst	 &	y oung	llp	 to	 provide	 independent	 advice	 on	 remuneration.	
in	 addition,	 the	 Company	 received	 actuarial	 and	 other	 pensions	 advice	
from	deloitte	llp	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 management	 of	 risk	 arising	 from	
the	uK	 final	 salary	 pension	 scheme.
n one	 of	 the	 Committee	 members	 has	 any	 personal	 financial	 interest	
(other	 than	 as	 a	 shareholder),	 conflict	 of	 interest,	 cross-directorships	
or	 day-to-day	 involvement	 in	 the	 running	 of	 the	business.
remuneration	poliCy
the	Committee	 aims	 to	 provide	 a	 remuneration	 policy	 consistent	
with	 the	 Group's	 overall	 business	 strategy	 and	 thereby	 attract	 and	
retain	 high	 calibre	 executives,	 align	 executives'	 rewards	 with	 the	
creation	 of	 shareholder	 value	 and	 motivate	 executives	 to	 achieve	 and	
maintain	 challenging	 levels	 of	 company	 and	 individual	 performance.	
Market	 rates	 are	 determined	 by	 reference	 to	 other	 companies	 of	
similar	 size,	 activities	 and	 complexity.	at	 the	 same	 time,	 policy	 in	 this	
area	 is	 sensitive	 to	 the	 remuneration	 structure	 within	 the	 Group.
the	Committee	 keeps	 both	 the	 fixed	 and	 variable	 elements	 of	 each	
executive	director's	 and	 senior	 executive's	 overall	 package	 under	
review.	in	 recent	 years,	 the	 Committee	 has	 progressively	 increased	
the	 proportion	 of	 variable	 as	 opposed	 to	 fixed	 element	 of	 pay,	 so	 that	
currently	 the	 total	 potential	 from	 variable	 performance	 related	 pay	
is	 now	 substantially	 in	 excess	 of	 basic	 pay.
t he	 Committee	 also	 considers	 the	 targets	 set	 for	 the	 variable	 elements	
of	e xecutive	directors'	 and	 senior	 executives'	 remuneration	 which	
at	 all	 times	 aim	 to	 encourage	 appropriate	 behaviours	 and	 deliver	
exceptional	 and	 sustainable	 financial	 performance	 measured	 against	
the	 Group's	 strategic	 plans.	
during	the	 year	 the	 Committee	 met	 seven	 times	 to	 consider	
amongst	 other	 matters:
	 		 the	 annual	 bonus	 and	 payments	 for	 the	 financial	 year	 ended
31	december	 2009;
	 		 the	 annual	 bonus	 structure	 and	 performance	 targets	 for	 the
financial	 year	 ended	 31	december	 2010;
	 		 basic	 salaries	 payable	 to	 each	 of	 the	e xecutive	directors	 to	 ensure	
they	 remain	 both	 competitive	 and	 aligned	 with	 remuneration	 policy;
	 		 the	 conditional	 awards	 made	 under	 the	bodycote	incentive	plan	
and,	 following	 shareholder	 approval	 at	 the	 2010	aGM	 of	 changes	
to	 the	bodycote	share	 Match	plan,	 the	 first	 round	 of	 awards	
under	 the	 new	bodycote	 Co-investment	plan;
	 		 the	 disclosure	 policy	 in	 relation	 to	 performance	 targets	 attaching	
to	 awards	 made	 under	 both	 its	 short	 and	 long	 term	 incentive	
plans	 as	 compared	 to	 its	 peers	 and	 general	 market	 practice;	 and
	 		 the	 company's	 remuneration	 policy	 in	 light	 of	 the	 revised	
recommendations	 in	 the	uK	 Corporate	 Governance	 Code	 (formerly	
the	 Combined	 Code)	 and	 the	 revised	abi	 guidelines	 on	e xecutive	
remuneration	published	 in	december	 2009.	
fiXeD	elements	of	pay
the	fixed	 elements	 of	 remuneration	 are	 salaries,	 pensions	
and	 other	 benefits.
Basic	salary
a s	 part	 of	 the	 Committee's	 annual	 review	 process	 the	 basic	 salaries	
for	 each	e xecutive	director	 and	 the	 senior	 executives	 were	 reviewed	
by	 the	 Committee	 during	 the	 year.	the	 review	 took	 into	 account	 the	
responsibilities	 and	 performance	 of	 the	 individual,	 current	 market	
practice	 and	 pay	 in	 similar	uK	 engineering	 businesses,	 companies	
who	 operate	 in	 the	 same	 sector	 as	bodycote	 and	 companies	 of	 a	
comparable	 size	 and	 scale	 of	 operations.	the	 Committee	 was	 also	
mindful	 of	 pay	 levels	 amongst	 the	 employee	 population.
pension	
t he	 Committee	 reviews	 the	 pension	 arrangements	 for	 the	e xecutive	
directors	to	 ensure	 that	 the	 benefits	 provided	 are	 consistent	 with	
those	 provided	 by	 other	 similar	 companies.
Mr	 Harris	 is	 a	 member	 of	 the	 Group's	 defined	 contribution	
arrangement	 and	 receives	 contributions	 from	 the	 Group	 at	 a	 rate	
of	 22%	 of	 basic	 salary.	in	 addition,	 in	 the	 event	 of	 death,	 a	 death	
in	 service	 benefit	 of	 eight	 times	 basic	 salary	 will	 become	 payable.
the	pension	 for	 Mr	landless	 is	 provided	 partly	 under	 the	 Group's	
uK	contributory	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 scheme,	 which	 has	 a	
normal	 retirement	 age	 of	 65	 and	 which	 is	 closed	 to	 new	 members	
with	 increases	 in	 pensionable	 salary	 capped	 at	 3%	 per	 annum,	 and	
partly	 through	 a	 defined	 contribution	 arrangement.	the	 Group's	
contributions	 to	 Mr	landless'	 defined	 contribution	 arrangement	 are	
16%	 of	 basic	 salary	 above	 the	 defined	 benefit	 scheme	 cap. 	 40	 bodyCote	 annual	 report	 2010				 business	 review	 :	 Corporate	 GovernanCe	 :	 aCCounts
board	 report	 on	reMuneration
Continued
the	defined	 benefit	 scheme	 also	 provides	 lump	 sum	 death-in-service	
benefits	 and	 pension	 benefits	 based	 on	 final	 pensionable	 salary.
a n	 analysis	 of	 the	 accrued	 pension	 entitlements	 for	 Mr	landless	 under	
the	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 scheme	 during	 2010	 is	 given	 on	 page	 42.
other	fixed	elements
the	Company	 provides	 other	 benefits	 in	 line	 with	 market	 practices.	
these	include	 the	 provision	 of	 a	 company	 car	 (or	 an	 allowance	 in	
lieu),	 private	 medical	 insurance	 for	 the	executive	directors	 and	 their	
families,	 and	 long-term	 disability	 insurance.
variaBle	elements	of	pay
there	are	 three	 variable	 elements	 of	 pay.
annual	 Bonuses
the	Committee	 provided	executive	directors	 and	 other	 senior	
executives	 with	 the	 opportunity	 to	 receive	 an	 annual	 bonus	 in	 2010	
of	 up	 to	 100%	 of	 basic	 salary,	 subject	 to	 meeting	 targets	 based	 upon	
Group,	 individual	 performance	 and	 the	 achievement	 of	 personal	
objectives.	 For	 those	 senior	 executives	 with	 divisional	 responsibilities,	
part	 of	 the	 performance-related	 bonus	 is	 also	 based	 on	 their	 relevant	
sphere	 of	 responsibility.	the	 Committee	 adopt	 a	 weighted	 basket	
of	 measures	 approach	 to	 target	 setting	 for	 annual	 bonuses	 that	
includes	 a	 range	 of	 key	 financial	 and	 individual	 performance	 metrics.	
t he	 Committee	 consider	 this	 approach	 the	 most	 appropriate	 in	 order	
to	 ensure	 behaviours	 are	 appropriately	 balanced.	
the	measures	 used	 for	 annual	 bonus	 payments	 in	 respect	 of	 2010,	
the	 maximum	 potential	 and	 the	 level	 of	 performance	 achieved	 are	
set	 out	 as	 follows:
Measure Maximum	 achievement
Group	 Management	operating	profit 50% 50%
Group	 Cash	 Management 30% 30%
Finally,	 up	 to	 20%	 of	 the	 annual	 bonus	 was	 subject	 to	 individual	
performance	 objectives.	several	 performance	 objectives	 are	 set	 for	
executive	directors	 and	 all	 senior	 executives	 and	 these	 are	 designed	 to	
achieve	 delivery	 of	 key	 financial	 and	 or	 strategic	 objectives	 for	 the	 Group.
in	 addition	 to	 the	 measures	 set	 out	 above,	 the	 Committee	 also	 has	
discretion	 to	 reduce	 the	 awards	 otherwise	 earned	 by	 up	 to	 10%	 to	
take	 into	 account	 the	 safety	 performance	 of	 the	 Group.
as	a	 result,	 the	 bonus	 payable	 was	 98%	 of	 basic	 salary	 for	 both	 the	
Chief	executive	 and	 the	 Finance	director	 in	 respect	 of	 performance	
in	 2010.
For	 2011	 the	 Committee	 has	 determined	 that	 the	 bonus	 opportunity	
for	e xecutive	directors	 and	 senior	 executives	 will	 again	 be	 contingent	
on	 meeting	 targets	 relating	 to	 safety,	 operating	 profit,	 cash	 management	
and	 personal	 objectives.	n o	 bonus	 will	 be	 paid	 for	 the	 cash	 management	
element	 unless	 the	 level	 of	 operating	 profit	 achieved	 is	 at	 least	 95%	
of	 target.
share	awards
bodycote	incentive	plan	 (bip)
t he	 Company	 operates	 the	bip	 under	 which	e xecutive	directors	 and	
senior	 executives	 are	 rewarded	 for	 the	 delivery	 of	 the	 Company's	
strategic	 plan.	 Final	 awards	 are	 based	 upon	 two	 performance	
measures,	 over	 a	 three	 year	 period:
	 		 50%	 of	 the	 award	 is	 subject	 to	 a	 return	 on	 capital	 employed	
(roCe)	 performance	 condition;	 and
	 		 50%	 of	 the	 award	 is	 subject	 to	 an	 earnings	 per	 share	 (eps)	
performance	 condition.
For	bip	 conditional	 awards	 made	 in	 2009,	 the	 Committee	 determined	
that	 the	 entry	 threshold	 targets	 require	roCe	equal	 to	 10%	 and	eps	
equal	 to	 16	 pence	 for	 the	 performance	 period	 ending	 31	december	
2011.	 For	bip	 conditional	 awards	 made	 in	 2010,	 the	 entry	 threshold	
targets	 require	roCe	and	eps	 of	 11.1%	 and	 19.8	 pence	 respectively	
for	 the	 performance	 period	 ending	 31	december	 2012.	
in	 the	 event	 that	 the	 entry	 threshold	 target	 for	 both	eps	 and	roCe	
are	 not	 achieved	 none	 of	 the	 conditional	 awards	 will	 vest.	regardless	
of	roCe	performance,	 should	eps	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 performance	
period	 be	 below	 16	 pence	 for	 awards	 made	 in	 2009	 and	 2010	 then	
no	 award	 shall	 vest.	
the	Committee	 intends	 to	 use	 the	roCe	and	eps	 measures	 in	
combination	 for	bip	awards	 made	 in	 2011.
details	of	 the	 awards	 made	 under	 the	bip	 are	 provided	 on	 page	 43.
Following	 completion	 of	 the	 performance	 period	 on	 31	december	 2010,	
the	remuneration	 Committee	 has	 determined	 that	 none	 of	 the	bip	
awards	 made	 in	 2008	 shall	 vest	 (2007:	nil).	
Deferred	share	awards
bodycote	Co-investment	plan	 (Cip)
a s	 noted	 above,	 certain	 changes	 made	 to	 the	b odycote	s hare	 Match	
plan	 (bsMp)	were	 approved	 by	 shareholders,	 now	 renamed	 as	 the	
bodycote	Co-investment	plan.	the	 Cip	continues	 to	 provide	 a	 link	
between	 the	 Company's	 short	 and	 long-term	 incentive	 arrangements	
and	 the	 key	 changes	 were:
	 		 executives	 are	 able	 to	 invest	 in	 shares	 up	 to	 a	 value	 equivalent
to	 40%	 of	 net	 basic	 salary	 regardless	 of	 whether	 a	 cash	 bonus	
has	 been	 paid;	 and
	 		 the	 performance	 criterion	 for	 awards	 is	 an	 absolute	total	
shareholder	return	(tsr)	 target.
the	Cip	will	 continue	 to	 provide	 the	 grant	 of	 awards	 of	 matching	
shares	 to	 participants	 on	 an	 annual	 basis	 in	 a	 maximum	 ratio	 of	 1:1	
to	 the	 gross	 investment	 made	 in	 deferred	 shares.	deferred	 shares	
must	 be	 held	 for	 three	 years	 and	 the	 threshold	 target	 for	 vesting	 of	
the	 matching	 shares	 awarded	 in	 2010	 and	 2011	 is	tsr	 growth	 of	
not	 less	 than	 4%	 per	 annum	 compound	 in	 excess	 of	 growth	 in	 the	
Consumer	prices	index	 (Cpi).	10%	 per	 annum	 compound	 growth	
in	 excess	 of	 growth	 in	 the	 Cpi	will	 be	 required	 for	 full	 vesting. 	 business	 review	 :	 Corporate	 GovernanCe	 :	 aCCounts				bodyCote	 annual	 report	 2010	 41
details	of	 the	 awards	 under	 the	 Cip	together	 with	 previous	 awards	
under	 the	bsMp	 and	 the	 joining	 award	 made	 to	 Mr	 Harris	 in	october	
2008	 are	 noted	 on	 page	 43.
Following	 completion	 of	 the	 performance	 period	 on	 31	december	 2010,	
the	remuneration	 Committee	 has	 determined	 that	 none	 of	 the	 share	
match	 awards	 made	 in	 2008	 under	 the	bsMp	 shall	 vest	 (2007:	nil).
total	shareholDer	return	 (tsr)
the	graph	 on	 page	 43	 illustrates	 the	 Company's	tsr	 performance	
since	 2005	 relative	 to	 the	 Ftse	all	share	industrial	index	 of	 which	
the	 Company	 is	 a	 component	 part.	this	 sector	 is	 considered	 the	
most	 appropriate	 comparator	 group	 over	 the	 five-year	 period	 to	
december	2010.	in	 line	 with	 market	 practice	 the	 calculation	 for	
tsr	 assumes	 reinvestment	 of	 dividends	 and	 is	 based	 on	 data	
provided	 by	datastream.
serviCe	 ContraCts
it	 is	 the	 Company's	 policy	 that	executive	directors	 have	 service	
contracts	 with	 a	 one-year	 notice	 period.	all	 the	e xecutive	directors	
have	 service	 agreements	 which	 are	 terminable	 by	 one	 year's	
notice	 by	 the	 employer	 at	 any	 time,	 and	 by	 payment	 of	 one	 year's	
remuneration	 in	 lieu	 of	 notice	 by	 the	 employer,	 and	 by	 one	 year's	
remuneration	 in	 the	 event	 of	 a	 change	 in	 control	 of	 the	 Company	
(save	 for	 Mr	 Harris	 where	 the	 change	 of	 control	 provision	 does	 not	
apply).	legally	 appropriate	 factors	 would	 be	 taken	 into	 account	 to	
mitigate	 any	 compensation	 payment,	 covering	 basic	 salary,	 annual	
incentives	 and	 benefits,	 which	 may	 arise	 on	 the	 termination	 of	
employment	 of	 any	executive	director,	 other	 than	 payments	 made	
on	 a	 change	 in	 control	 or	 for	 payments	 in	 lieu	 of	 notice.	 Mr	 Harris'	
service	 agreement	 is	 dated	 6	october	 2008	 and	 Mr	landless'	
contract	 is	 dated	 26	september	 2001.	
eXeCutive	 DireCtors'	shareholDing	retention	poliCy
in	 2005	 the	 Committee	 introduced	 a	 shareholding	 retention	 policy	
under	 which	executive	directors	 and	 other	 senior	 executives	 are	
expected,	 within	 five	 years	 of	 that	 date	 or	 commencement	 of	
employment	 if	 later,	 to	 build	 up	 a	 shareholding	 in	 the	 Company.	
in	 respect	 of	e xecutive	directors	 the	 expectation	 is	 to	 hold	 at	 least	
100%	 of	 basic	 salary.	as	 at	 31	december	 2010,	 the	 Committee	 is	
satisfied	 that	 the	e xecutive	directors	 have	 fulfilled	 this	 requirement.
non-eXeCutive	 DireCtors
the	remuneration	 of	non-executive	directors	 is	 determined	 by	
the	 Chairman	 and	 the	executive	directors.	remuneration	 for	
the	 Chairman	 is	 determined	 by	 the	 whole	board	 (excluding	 the	
Chairman).	remuneration	 for	 the	 Chairman	 and	non-executive	
directors	takes	 into	 account	 the	 time	 commitments	 and	 duties	
and	 responsibilities	 involved.	the	 Chairman	 and	 each	non-executive	
director	hold	 letters	 of	 appointment	 for	 terms	 of	 three	 years	 (or	 41	
months	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 Chairman).
each	 is	 terminable	 under	 the	 Company's	articles	 of	association,	
the	act,	 by	 the	director's	 resignation	 or	 otherwise	 on	 six	 months'	
notice	 (twelve	 months	 in	 the	 case	 of	 the	 Chairman)	 if	 termination	
occurs	 before	 expiry	 of	 the	 term.	
t o	 determine	 the	 fees	 it	 pays	 to	non-executive	directors,	 the	b oard	
takes	 into	 account	 the	 need	 to	 attract	 individuals	 of	 appropriate	
calibre	 and	 expertise,	 the	 fees	 paid	 to	non-executive	directors	 by	
other	 companies	 of	 a	 similar	 size	 and	 scale	 of	 operations	 and	 the	
time	 commitment	 attached	 to	 each	 appointment.	the	board	 keeps	
fees	 under	 review.	the	 Chairman	 and	non-executive	directors	 are	
not	 entitled	 to	 any	 pension	 or	 other	 employment	 benefits	 or	 to	
participate	 in	 any	 incentive	 scheme.
