REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT
John Coleman
Remuneration Committee Chairman
Dear shareholder,
This is the Company' s first Directors' 
Remuneration Report since it listed on 
AIM in November 2013. The Remuneration 
Committee itself is new. It is our intention 
to adopt best practice amongst AIM-listed 
companies for remuneration reporting, which 
involves applying a number of the features 
of the directors' remuneration reporting 
regulations for main-market companies. 
In particular we will next year be providing 
a full future policy table with graphical scenario 
illustrations, a table showing a  single total 
figure' of remuneration for each Director 
and an historical performance graph.
However, you will understand that the 
newly-listed plc inherited remuneration 
policies which, although entirely suited to 
a private equity portfolio company preparing 
itself for an IPO, may not be right for a listed 
plc with a new business strategy. For this 
reason, the Committee has embarked on 
a full review of the remuneration package, 
including annual bonus and share plans, 
for Executive Directors and other senior 
executives. Where required, we will seek 
members' approval for these plans. However, 
we will not be in a position to confirm our 
full future remuneration philosophy and policy 
until next year' s report. At that time we will 
demonstrate, in line with best practice, 
how the remuneration plans align executive 
interests with those of shareholders and how 
they support the business strategy and link 
to the KPIs.
For the purpose of this report we are limiting 
the statement on future policy to a description 
of the remuneration arrangements for the 
2014-15 financial year.
The Directors' remuneration in the pre-IPO 
company comprised a number of components 
that were described in the Admission 
Document. These are mostly carried over 
into the new financial year with some 
small changes.
Executive Directors' salaries have been 
increased by 15%. DC pension contributions 
and insured benefits as a percentage of salary 
are unchanged. The maximum bonus 
opportunity of 100% of salary for Executive 
Directors is unchanged, but the principal 
measure has been changed from EBITDA 
to profit before tax and exceptional items, 
as more suitable for a listed plc.
A year before the IPO, Executive Directors 
(and some other senior executives) were 
awarded substantial grants of restricted 
shares which vest in equal tranches over four 
years (first vesting January 2013). There are 
no performance-related vesting conditions 
- the grants were designed by the private 
equity owners to provide an incentive to 
maximise the flotation price and maximise 
shareholder returns over the period following 
the IPO. Any dividends are rolled up and paid 
at vesting. Given the executives' continued 
interest in these restricted shares, it is neither 
necessary nor appropriate to add further 
long-term incentives this coming year, 
although we will be developing plans for 
the longer term for all senior executives.
Full details of the current package are 
provided in the Statement of implementation 
of remuneration policy on page 37.
At the forthcoming AGM, we will be seeking 
shareholders' approval for the adoption in 
due course of SAYE and SIP schemes, 
which will enable the Company to offer 
share participation to substantially all of its 
employees on tax-efficient terms through 
HMRC approved plans.
I look forward very much to meeting 
shareholders, at the right time, to explain our 
remuneration philosophy and future policy 
and to receive your views. 
John Coleman 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
13 June 2014

37 Bonmarch  Annual Report   2014
Bonus payment for 2013-14
In the year 2013-14, the Executive Directors participated in a bonus plan based, principally, on improvement in EBITDA over the preceding 
year. The maximum payable was 100% of salary, which was not achieved.
2012 share ownership scheme
The Executive Directors participated in a share incentive scheme established by the selling shareholder, BM Holdings S.  r.l., prior to the IPO. 
This involved a single grant of restricted shares in October 2012, with shares vesting equally over five years, commencing on 20 January 2013. 
Details of the award are shown in the following table. The shares are held under a Restricted Share Agreement, which allows the proportion of 
any Company distributions relating to the vested shares to be paid to scheme participants. Distributions in respect of any unvested shares are 
held in an escrow account until the shares vest. No new share-based grants were made to Executive Directors in 2013-14.
Share Awards table
All awards were made prior to admission to the AIM market and were originally issued by the previous parent company, Bluebird UK T opco 
Limited. Following a restructure which took place in September 2013, the shares were exchanged for shares in the new company, Bonmarch  
Holdings Limited. These were re-designated as A ordinary shares of 1p when Bonmarch  Holdings Limited re-registered as a plc and listed on 
AIM. The shares were converted at a ratio that as far as possible ensured there was no change in the proportion of Company ownership for 
any individual.

Performance graph and table
As the Company only listed in November 2013, no historical performance graph and table is included this year.
Statement of implementation of remuneration policy for 2014-15
The Directors' remuneration pre-IPO comprised a number of components that were described in the Admission Document. These are mostly 
carried over into the new financial year with some small changes. The Remuneration Committee is carrying out a full review of remuneration 
policy and will report its new future policy in next year' s report.
Base salary - The basis of for salary determination is unchanged. Salaries are reviewed on 1 October each year. The 2014-15 salaries for 
Executive Directors are set out below:
Beth Butterwick Chief Executive  270,300 p.a.
Stephen Alldridge Finance Director  183,600 p.a.
Pension - The Executive Directors are members of a Group personal pension plan to which the Company contributes 20% of the individual 
Executive Director' s salary. T o avoid excessive taxation above the Government' s pension allowance levels an individual may opt to take an 
amount of the contribution as a non-pensionable, non-bonusable cash allowance from which the Company deducts any employer national 
insurance charges.
Benefits in Kind - The type and level of benefits in relation to salary remain unchanged from last year.
Annual bonus - For 2014-2015, the Executive Directors are entitled to an annual bonus to a maximum of 100% salary. The on-target 
payment is 50% of salary. Payment is dependent on achievement of a target of Group profit before tax and exceptional items, with 
a minimum payment of 5% at 95% of target and a maximum payment at target profit plus 15%. No part of any award will be deferred 
or subject to clawback.
Long-term incentive and share plans - Apart from the time-based vesting of the 2014 tranche of the 2012 restricted share award,  38 Bonmarch  Annual Report   2014

the Executive Directors are not eligible for awards under any long-term plan.

remuneration. Their fees are subject to review each October. No Director is present when their own remuneration is discussed. The Chairman 
receives no payment from the Group, but a fee of  100,000 per annum is payable to Sun Capital Partners Management V , LLC in respect of 
his services. There are no review provisions.

Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors' remuneration
The Remuneration Committee was newly formed following the IPO in November 2013. Its members are John Coleman (Committee Chairman) 
and Ishbel Macpherson. The Committee terms of reference are available on the Company website. The Committee is taking advice from 
MM&K Limited, an independent remuneration consultancy.
Directors' Remuneration Policy
As the Remuneration Committee is reviewing the future remuneration policy in light of the Company' s newly listed status and business 
strategy, we are not publishing a Future Policy T able this year and, therefore, no graphical illustration of future policy. We expect to include 
a full table in next year' s report, plus a statement of how the new policy will be applied to recruits. For now, shareholders are referred to the 
Statement of Implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2014-15 above on page 37.
Service agreements and termination payments
Details of the Executive Directors' service agreements are set out below.

Stephen Alldridge, Finance Director 3 Mar 2003 Rolling contract 12 months 12 months
There are no specific provisions under which Executive Directors are entitled to receive compensation upon early termination, other than in 
accordance with the notice period. On termination of an Executive Director' s service contract, the Remuneration Committee will take into 
account the departing Director' s duty to mitigate his loss when determining the amount of any compensation.

The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts, but serve under letters of appointment, and a consultancy agreement in respect of 
the Chairman. Each appointment is for up to three years and shareholders may vote on re-appointment at annual general meetings. The terms 
and conditions under which the Non-executive Directors are appointed can be found on the Company' s website www.bonmarcheplc.co.uk.
The remuneration payable to Non-executive Directors is decided upon by the Chairman and Executive Directors.
