 Introduction
Following Admission on 14 March 2014, the Remuneration Committee ( Committee') assumed responsibility for 
determining the remuneration policy for the executive directors and other members of senior management and 
for overseeing the company's share plans. 
During this financial year, the Committee will review the company's remuneration policy. The primary objective 
of this review is to ensure that the policy is suitable for the group's current and future growth aspirations and the 
planned transition from AIM to a full listing over the next few years, whilst also reflecting the unique characteristics 
that have made boohoo.com successful to date. 
The Committee is committed to complying with the principles of good corporate governance in relation to the 
design of its remuneration policy, and such our policy will follow the UK Corporate Governance Code, the QCA 
Remuneration Guidance, and the ABI Principles of Remuneration, as far as is appropriate to boohoo.com's 
management structure and the company's size and listing. 
As boohoo.com plc was not listed during the year ended 28 February 2014, this report is not prepared in 
accordance with remuneration reporting regulations - rather, it is designed to provide shareholders with further 
information on the role of the Committee and the current remuneration of the board of directors. 
Next year, the Committee intends to produce a full remuneration report prepared in accordance with the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, as amended, to the extent 
relevant for an AIM listed company. 
Remuneration Committee
The Committee was established on Admission. It is responsible for making recommendations to the board 
regarding the remuneration of the executive directors and other senior managers, determining their terms and 
conditions of service and overseeing the company's share plans. The Committee's terms of reference are available 
on the company's website at www.boohooplc.com.
The members of the Committee are currently David Forbes (who is also the Committee Chairman), Mark Newton-
Jones and Stephen Morana, all of whom are non-executive directors of the company.
The Committee has appointed independent remuneration consultants New Bridge Street ( NBS') to advise, 
as required, on senior executive remuneration. Neither NBS, nor AonHewitt of which it is part, provide any other 
services to the company. 
Pay philosophy
The aim of the remuneration policy is to attract, retain and motivate high calibre senior executives, whilst ensuring 
that no more than necessary is paid. There is a significant variable pay component, designed to incentivise the 
delivery of the group's growth strategy. The interests of the executives are designed to align with the interests of 
shareholders through encouraging equity ownership and the award of equity incentive plans where necessary. 
These principles are reflected across the company as a whole. In particular, an aim of the company's remuneration 
policy is to encourage widespread equity ownership across the employees, and in support of this objective, 
on Admission we granted an award of free shares to all our employees under an HMRC Approved SIP . It is also 
intended that employees will be offered the opportunity to invest in our shares on a tax-efficient basis through 
offering partnership shares under the SIP .

 R e mu n er a t ion r e p o rt Pay policy for executive directors
Remuneration for the executive directors comprises the following elements, not all of which are currently provided 
to each executive director:
 	base salary
 	pension 
 	annual bonus
 	the Executive Share Option Plan ( ESOP')
Base salary
Currently, the salaries of the executive directors are  225,000 for Mahmud Kamani,  225,000 for Carol Kane and 
 150,000 for Neil Catto. 
Salaries will be reviewed annually, with the next review being scheduled to take effect for the year commencing 
1 March 2015. 
Pension and other benefits
Carol Kane and Neil Catto receive a company pension contribution of 5% of salary. Mahmud Kamani does not 
receive a company pension contribution.
Carol Kane and Neil Catto receive company health care and life assurance.
Annual bonus
All of the executive directors are eligible to participate in the company wide annual cash bonus plan. 
The Committee oversees the bonus plan, and any bonus payments are at the discretion of the Committee.
Under the annual bonus plan, performance is measured over a single financial year. For the financial year ending 
28 February 2015, the performance targets will be based on inter alia a combination of revenue and EBITDA 
metrics, (as defined in the plan), both of which will carry equal weighting. This choice of metrics reflects that these 
measures have been identified as the key indicators of the company's success against its growth strategy. 
Executive Share Option Plan ( ESOP')
On Admission, Neil Catto (together with a number of other selected senior executives who received differing 
levels of award), was granted 2,000,000 options with an exercise price of 50 pence per share. These options 
will become exercisable on the third anniversary of grant until 14 March 2024, subject to the achievement 
of performance conditions. 
The performance targets applying to the ESOP awards are based on the achievement of an aggregate group 
EBITDA target (as defined in the ESOP plan documentation) over the three financial years 2015, 2016 and 2017 . 75% 
of the options will become exercisable for the achievement of 75% of the target, rising on a straight-line-basis to 
100% vesting for full achievement of the target. 
As founder shareholders, neither Mahmud Kamani nor Carol Kane, both of whom have retained a significant equity 
stake in the company, received ESOP awards on Admission. 
The ESOP is considered an effective equity incentive vehicle as it aligns closely with the interests of shareholders 
both via the requirement to achieve performance targets linked to our financial performance.
It is intended that grants of options will continue to be made under the ESOP periodically at the discretion 
of the Committee.
