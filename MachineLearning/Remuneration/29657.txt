REMUNERATION REPORT
This section of the Annual Report and Accounts describes the role and composition of the Remuneration Committee (the Committee ), 
the Company's remuneration policy and the arrangements currently in place for remuneration of both Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors. 
The Remuneration Committee
Membership
The Committee comprises Lord Bilimoria (Chairman) and Andrew Cripps.  Prior to their appointment on 16 January 2008, the committee 
members were Richard Rose and Kevin Lyon.
Role of the Committee
The Committee advises the Board and makes recommendations to it about all elements of the remuneration packages of the Executive 
Directors and certain senior executives of the Company.  It recommends the terms of service contracts with Executive Directors and any 
compensation arrangements resulting from the termination by the Company of an Executive Director's service contract.  The Committee 
also makes recommendations concerning the grant of shares and share options. 
The Committee's responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference, which are published on the Company's Website.
Remuneration policy 
The Company wishes to attract, retain and motivate senior management of the requisite quality.  Accordingly, its policy, in a competitive 
market, is to design remuneration packages which, through an appropriate combination of basic salary and bonus, reward senior 
management fairly for their individual contribution.  The Committee's overall policy is to provide competitive and potentially rewarding 
remuneration packages. The Committee has been reviewing the equity incentives it has in place as it believes that long term incentives 
are an important element of remuneration packages. To this end, the Committee intends to operate a savings-related share option 
scheme which will extend to all employees within the Group, and a long-term incentive plan (the LTIP) which will be extended on a 
discretionary basis to certain employees only. Under the LTIP , employees selected to participate will be entitled to acquire shares for no 
payment at the end of a vesting period (which will normally be three years). Vesting will be subject to continued employment and certain 
performance conditions being satisfi ed. In certain circumstances, however, a proportion of awards may vest early. There will be a limit on 
the number of shares that may be issued pursuant to options and awards of 10% of the share capital of the Company. Details of awards 
made under these plans will be disclosed in next year's Annual Report and Accounts.
Executive Directors' remuneration
The remuneration package of the Executive Directors includes the following elements:
Basic salary   
Salaries are normally reviewed annually and any changes are effective from 1 April. 
Bonus   
Payments under the annual scheme are based upon the achievement of budgeted profi t targets for the Group.  
Pensions   
The Executive Directors are entitled to a pension contribution at the rate of 15% of pensionable pay to be paid into their own 
personal pension arrangement or the Group personal pension plan, open to all of its permanent employees.  Pensionable pay is 
set at basic salary. 
Details of individual pension arrangements are set out in the table on page 15.
Other benefi ts   
Benefi ts for executives principally comprise a car (or car allowance), private medical insurance, life cover of four times basic salary, 
critical illness cover of at least twice basic salary and permanent health cover.

External appointments
Executive Directors are not permitted to hold external directorships or offi ces of other fully listed or AIM listed companies.
Non-Executive Directors' remuneration
The fees for the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board.  The Non-Executive Directors are not involved in any discussions 
or decisions about their own remuneration. 
The Non-Executive Directors do not receive bonuses or pension contributions and are not entitled to participate in any of the Company's 
share schemes.  They are entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred by them in carrying out their duties as Directors 
of the Company.
Details of the fees paid to Non-Executive Directors are set out in the table below.
Sums paid to third parties
No consideration was paid to or became receivable by third parties for making available the services of any person as a Director of the 
Company during the year.
Terms of Appointment
At each Annual General Meeting, one third of Directors are required to retire and stand for re-election. Details of those Directors retiring by 
rotation this year are contained in the notice of Annual General Meeting as enclosed separately with this Annual Report and Accounts.
Service Contracts
The Board's policy is that service contracts of Executive Directors should provide for termination by the Company on twelve months' 
notice.  The service contracts of each of the current Executive Directors provide for such a period of notice.
The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for an initial period of 3 years subject to termination on one month's notice by 
the relevant Director or the company.  These letters are available for inspection at the Company's registered offi ce and at the Annual 
General Meeting.
