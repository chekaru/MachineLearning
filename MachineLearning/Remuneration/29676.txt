this section of the annual report and accounts describes the role and composition of the remuneration committee established by the 
Board (the  committee'), the company's remuneration policy and the arrangements currently in place for remuneration of both executive 
and non-executive Directors. 
The Remuneration Committee 
Membership 
the committee during the year comprised lord Bilimoria (chairman) and andrew cripps, both of whom are considered by the Board 
to be independent non-executive Directors. charles Wilson, chief executive, attends committee meetings by invitation. Details of 
attendance at committee meetings are set out on page 12. since the year end and following his appointment as a non-executive 
Director on 27 May 2009, richard Farr has joined the remuneration committee.
Role of the Committee 
the committee advises the Board and makes recommendations to it about all elements of the remuneration packages of the executive 
Directors and certain senior executives of the company, including remuneration, incentives and other benefits. It also recommends the terms of 
service contracts with executive Directors and any compensation arrangements resulting from the termination by the company of an executive 
Director's service contract. the committee also makes recommendations concerning the grant of shares and share options. 
the committee's responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference, which are published on the company's website.
In determining remuneration, the committee consults where appropriate with the chief executive about its proposals. no Director or 
senior executive participates in discussions about his own remuneration. no external consultants were engaged in relation to the design of 
remuneration packages during the year, save for pricewaterhousecoopers llp in relation to the design of the psp & sa Ye (both as defined 
below). When setting its remuneration policy, the committee gives due consideration to the provisions and principles of the code.
Remuneration policy 
the company wishes to attract, retain and motivate senior management of the requisite quality. accordingly, its policy, in a competitive market, 
is to design remuneration packages which, through an appropriate combination of basic salary and bonus, reward senior management fairly 
for their individual contribution. the committee's overall policy is to provide competitive and potentially rewarding remuneration packages. 
the committee, having reviewed the equity incentives it had in place, established in July 2008 a savings-related share option scheme 
(the  sa Ye'), as approved by HM revenue & customs, which was extended to all employees within the Group, and a performance share 
plan (the  psp') also in July 2008, which was extended on a discretionary basis to certain employees only. certain information relating to 
the sa Ye and psp were set out in the remuneration report contained in the company's 2008 annual report and accounts which was 
approved by shareholders at the company's annual General Meeting in 2008. under the psp, employees selected to participate are 
entitled to acquire ordinary shares for no payment at the end of a vesting period (which will normally be 2 to 3 years). the company has 
made awards under the psp in relation to a total of 36 million new ordinary shares. Vesting is subject to continued employment and the 
requirement that the company's share price be equal to or exceed certain share price targets for 60 consecutive days ending on or before 
the relevant vesting date. In certain circumstances, however, a proportion of awards may vest early. Details of awards made to the executive 
Directors under these plans are set out later in this report. options under the sa Ye are exercisable three years from the commencement of 
the relevant savings contract and not more than six months thereafter. 
Executive Directors' remuneration 
the remuneration package of the executive Directors includes the following elements: 
Basic salary  	
salaries are normally reviewed annually and any changes are effective from 1 april. no changes were made to salaries effective from 
1 april 2009. Details of the Directors' remuneration are set out on page19. 
 Bonus  	
payments under the annual scheme are based upon the achievement of budgeted profit targets for the Group. Jonathan prentis, 
Bryan Drew and Bryn satherley have each been awarded a bonus of approximately 35 per cent of their annual salary.
Share incentives  	
the executive Directors are entitled to participate in the psp and the sa Ye.
Pensions  	
all executive Directors are entitled to a pension contribution at the rate of 15% of pensionable pay to be paid into their own personal 
pension arrangement or the Group personal pension plan, open to all of its permanent employees. pensionable pay is set at basic 
salary. Details of pension contributions in relation to the executive Directors are set out in the table on page 19.
Other benefits  	
Benefits for executive Directors principally comprise critical illness cover and permanent health cover. all executive Directors are also 
entitled to a car (or car allowance), life cover of four times basic salary and private medical insurance for themselves and their families.

External appointments 
executive Directors are not permitted to hold external directorships or offices of other fully listed or aIM listed companies and, 
accordingly, no executive Director serves as a non-executive Director of any other company.
Non-Executive Directors' letters of appointment
the non-executive Directors are paid a fixed fee and have letters of appointment for an initial period of 3 years subject to termination 
on one month's notice by the relevant Director or the company. these appointments are also subject to the articles of association of 
the company. these letters are available for inspection at the company's registered office during business hours and at the annual 
General Meeting. 
the fees for the non-executive Directors are determined by the Board and reviewed from time to time having regard to the level of 
fees paid to non-executive Directors of comparator companies and reflect the individual commitments of the non-executive Directors 
to the Board and to the Board's committees. the non-executive Directors are not involved in any discussions or decisions about their 
own remuneration. 
other than richard rose, who has share options in the company that were awarded prior to the reverse acquisition in 2007, the 
non-executive Directors do not receive bonuses or pension contributions and are not entitled to participate in any of the company's 
share schemes. they are entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred by them in carrying out their duties as Directors 
of the company. 
Executive Directors' service contracts
the Board's policy is that service contracts of executive Directors should provide for termination by the company on twelve months' 
notice. the service contracts of each of the current executive Directors provide for such a period of notice. none of the contracts 
provides for specific contractual termination payments other than payment in lieu of notice. 
the company's policy on the termination of contracts of service of senior executives is dictated by the events, bearing in mind the 
circumstances of termination and the interests of the company. these service contracts are available for inspection at the company's 
registered office during business hours and at the annual General Meeting.
Sums paid to third parties 
no consideration was paid to or became receivable by third parties for making available the services of any person as a Director of 
the company during the year. 
Terms of appointment 
at each annual General Meeting, in accordance with the company's articles of association, one third (or if their number is not a multiple 
of three, the number nearest to, but not exceeding, one third) of Directors, excluding those Directors appointed since the last annual 
General Meeting, are required to retire and may stand for re-election. In addition, all Directors appointed during the year must retire at the 
annual General Meeting and may offer themselves for re-appointment. Bryan Drew, Bryn satherley, Karen Jones and r ichard Farr, having 
been appointed during the year, will each therefore retire at the annual General Meeting and offer themselves for re-appointment. charles 
Wilson will retire by rotation at the annual General Meeting, and being eligible, will offer himself for re-election.
