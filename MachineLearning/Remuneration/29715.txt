this section of the annual report and accounts describes the role and composition of the remuneration committee established by 
the Board (the  committee'), the company's remuneration policy and the arrangements currently in place for remuneration of both 
executive and non-executive Directors. 
Unaudited Information
The Remuneration Committee
Membership 
the committee during the year from 26 March 2010 to 18 January 2011 comprised lord Bilimoria (chairman), andrew cripps and 
richard farr. from 18 January 2011 until 18 May 2011 the committee comprised Karen Jones (chairman), lord Bilimoria, andrew 
cripps and richard farr. since 18 May 2011, the committee has comprised Karen Jones (chairman), lord Bilimoria and andrew 
cripps. all members of the committee are considered to be independent non-executive Directors. richard rose, chairman, and 
charles Wilson, chief executive, attend committee meetings by invitation. Details of attendance at committee meetings during the 
year under review are set out on page 12. 
role of the Committee 
the remuneration committee advises the Board and makes recommendations to it:
 	 on the remuneration packages for the executive officers and senior executives including remuneration, incentives and other benefits;
 	 on the terms of service contracts with executive officers and senior executives and any compensation arrangements resulting 
from the termination of an executive officer or senior executive's service contract; and
 	 concerning share incentive plans. 
the committee's responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference, which are published on the Group's website.
in determining remuneration, the committee consults where appropriate with the chief executive about its proposals. no Director 
participates in discussions about their own remuneration. no external consultants were engaged in relation to the design of remuneration 
packages during the year, however pricewaterhousecoopers llp ( pwc') was engaged by the remuneration committee to provide 
benchmarking on executive and n on-executive Directors' remuneration packages. When setting its remuneration policy the committee 
gives due consideration to the provisions and principles of the code.
the remuneration committee addressed the following main issues during the year:
 	 reviewing the remuneration of the executive Directors with the assistance of benchmark data provided by pwc;
 	 reviewing the executive and employee bonus arrangements and targets; 
 	 overseeing remuneration policy for senior executives and employees;
 	 overseeing employee share plans; and
 	 the disclosures in this report.
also, as part of this year's review, a number of major shareholders were consulted regarding long-term incentives and other aspects 
of executive remuneration. 
remuneration policy 
the committee's overall policy is to provide competitive and potentially rewarding remuneration packages. the company wishes 
to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors and senior management of the requisite quality. accordingly, its policy, in a 
competitive market, is to design remuneration packages which reward executive Directors and senior management fairly for their 
individual contribution. in determining remuneration, consideration is (and was, in respect of the year under review) given to reward 
levels throughout the organisation as well as in the external employment market.

Executive Directors' remuneration 
the remuneration package of the executive Directors includes the following elements: 
 	 Basic salary 
in october 2010, benchmarking data was sourced from pwc which showed that the executive Directors' remuneration (other 
than in respect of charles Wilson, chief executive, and Guy farrant) were below the market median of comparator companies 
and were increased, in line with that data, from october 2010. Details of the Directors' remuneration are set out on page 21. 
salaries are normally reviewed annually taking into account individual performance, prevailing market conditions, Group profitability, 
recent pay awards in the Group generally and external benchmark data. any changes are effective from 1 april. salaries effective 
from 1 april 2011 are set out on page 22.
 	 Bonus 
payments under the annual scheme are based upon year on year improvement in eBitDa. no bonus is paid unless there is an 
improvement in the eBitDa for the company on an annual basis. payments to Directors are based upon a percentage of basic 
salary and do not form part of pensionable earnings. Jonathan prentis, Mark a ylwin, Guy farrant and Bryn satherley have each 
been awarded a bonus as set out on page 23. charles Wilson, chief executive, does not participate in the scheme. 
the remuneration committee has agreed to exercise its discretion and allow Bryan Drew, notwithstanding his resignation from 
the company on 25 March 2011 but having regard to his contribution to the success of the company and his continuing support 
thereafter, to receive an ex-gratia sum equivalent to the bonus he would have received had he been employed as at 8 July 2011.
 	 Share incentives
the executive Directors are entitled to participate in the psp and the sa Ye. Details of awards made to the executive Directors 
under the sa Ye and the psp are set out later in this report.
 	 Pensions 
the normal retirement age for executive Directors is 65. all executive Directors are entitled to a pension contribution at the rate 
of 15% of pensionable pay to be paid into their own personal pension arrangement or the Group defined contribution personal 
pension plan, which is open to all of its permanent employees. pensionable pay is set at the prior year's basic salary. Details of 
pension contributions in relation to the executive Directors are set out in the table on page 23.
 	 Other benefits 
Benefits for executive Directors comprise critical illness cover, permanent health cover, car (or car allowance), life cover of four 
times basic salary, private medical insurance and permanent health insurance for themselves and their families. 
External appointments 
executive Directors are not permitted to hold directorships or offices of companies whose shares are listed on a recognised stock 
exchange and, accordingly, no executive Director serves as a non-executive Director of any such company.
non-Executive Directors' letters of appointment
the non-executive Directors are paid a fixed fee and have letters of appointment for an initial period of 3 years subject to termination 
on one month's notice by the relevant Director or the company. these appointments are also subject to the articles of association 
of the company. the table below summarises the dates of appointment and most recent re-election dates for the chairman and 
each of the non-executive Directors serving at 25 March 2011.

copies of the letters of appointment will be available for inspection at the company's registered office during business hours and 
at the 2011 annual General Meeting. 
in accordance with the code, all non-executive Directors will be standing for re-election at the 2011 annual General Meeting. 
in october 2010, benchmarking data was sourced from pwc, which showed that the non-executive Directors' fees were below 
the market median of comparator companies and were increased in line with that data. fees have been set to reflect the individual 
commitments of the non-executive Directors to the Board and to the Board's committees. the non-executive Directors are not 
involved in any discussions or decisions about their own remuneration. 
the Board has determined that the time commitment of non-executive Directors should be 12 days per annum. the time commitment 
for non-executive Directors is set out in the relevant non-executive Director's letter of appointment. 
the non-executive Directors do not receive bonuses or pension contributions and are not entitled to participate in any of the 
company's share schemes. they are entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred by them in carrying out their duties 
as Directors of the company. 
With effect from 1 april 2011, the non-executive Directors' fees in relation to the company will be as follows:

Executive Directors' service contracts
the Board's policy is that service contracts of executive Directors should provide for termination by the company on twelve months' 
notice. the service contracts of each of the current executive Directors provide for such a period of notice. none of the contracts 
provides for specific contractual termination payments other than payment in lieu of notice.
the company's approach to the termination of contracts of service of executive Directors is dictated by the relevant events, bearing 
in mind the circumstances of termination and the interests of the company. 
the table below summarises the service contracts of the executive Directors.
copies of the service contracts will be available for inspection at the company's registered office during business hours and at the 
2011 annual General Meeting.

Sums paid to third parties 
no consideration was paid to third parties for making available the services of any person as a Director of the company during the year. 
t erms of appointment 
in accordance with the revised code, all Directors will be required to stand for re-election annually. in addition, as required by the 
company's articles of association, all Directors appointed during the year must retire at the annual General Meeting and may offer 
themselves for election. Guy farrant and stewart Gilliland having been appointed during the year, will therefore retire at the 2011 
annual General Meeting and will offer themselves for election. 
Directors' Share Interests 
the beneficial interests in the ordinary shares of the company of Directors who held office at the end of the financial year are set 
out in the Directors' report.
Performance Graph
the company's performance from June 2007 to March 2011 measured by t otal shareholder return ( tsr'), is compared in the 
chart below with the performance of the ftse 250 index (excluding investment trusts) and ftse aiM all share index. these are 
considered the most appropriate indices against which to measure performance following the reverse acquisition of Blueheath in 
June 2007, which was at that time listed on aiM, the company's admission to listing on the official list and to trading on the london 
stock exchange plc's main market for listed securities in July 2009 and its inclusion in the ftse 250 index in December 2009. 
 
 
tsr is defined as the return a shareholder would receive if they held a notional number of shares and received dividends over a 
period of time. assuming dividends are reinvested into the company's shares, it measures the percentage growth in the company's 
share price together with any dividends paid.

(a) the aggregate gains made by Directors on the exercise of options was  550,070 (2010:  nil).
(b)  represents the earliest exercise date (assuming satisfaction of the relevant performance condition) and latest expiry date of options held by the Director 
during the year. the performance condition is described below.
(c)  the options were exercised on 4 november 2010, on which date the closing mid market price of a ordinary share was 55.07p.
* at the time of exercise, to the extent that there is a gain on the csop option, psp options will be forfeited to the same value.
 the closing mid market price of an ordinary share on 25 March 2011 was 58.35p and the price range during the year was 38.64p 
to 60.55p.
PSP options 
the committee established a performance share plan (the  psp') in July 2008, which was extended on a discretionary basis to 
certain employees only. certain information relating to the psp was set out in the remuneration report contained in the company's 
2008 annual report and accounts which was approved by shareholders at the company's annual General Meeting in 2008. 
PSP options granted in 2008
in 2008, the company made awards under the psp in relation to a total of 36.5 million new ordinary shares. under the psp , 
employees selected to participate are entitled to acquire ordinary shares for no payment at the end of a vesting period (which will 
normally be 3 years). the Directors believe that the best indicator of performance of the company and its Directors is its share 
price performance. vesting is subject to continued employment and the requirement that the company's share price be equal to or 
exceed certain share price targets for 60 consecutive days ending on or before the relevant vesting date. in certain circumstances, 
however, a proportion of awards may vest early. 
a quarter of the ordinary shares subject to each award will vest on reaching share prices of 28.75p, 30.5p, 34.5p and 46p over a 
consecutive 60 day period. as at the 25 March 2011, all four share price targets had been met. consequently, half of the shares 
vested in July 2010, with the remainder vesting in July 2011, subject to continued employment at the dates of vesting. the options 
will lapse if not exercised within ten years of the date of award.
the remuneration committee has agreed to exercise it's discretion and allow the balance of Bryan Drew's psp options awarded in 
2008 to vest in July 2011, notwithstanding his resignation from the company on 25 March 2011 having regard to his contribution 
to the success of the company and his continuing support thereafter.

PSP options granted in 2010
in october 2010, the company made further awards under the psp in relation to a total of 11.3 million new ordinary shares. the 
options granted will vest and become exercisable three years from the date of the award subject to continued employment and 
the performance conditions mentioned below being satisfied and will lapse if not exercised within ten years of the date of award. 
a quarter of each option will vest on reaching each of the share prices of 60p, 62.5p, 70p and 90p, in each case sustained over a 
consecutive 60-day period. as at 25 March 2011, none of the four share price targets had been met.
Guy Farrant
on 14 october 2010, Guy was granted a special performance share award (in the form of a nil-cost option) over 3.9 million ordinary 
shares in the company ( the option'). the option was granted specifically in connection with Guy's appointment as a Director and 
shareholder approval was not sought because of these unusual circumstances. 
the option is in two parts: one part relates to 2.1 million ordinary shares in the company and the other part relates to 1.8 million 
ordinary shares in the company. a third of the 2.1 million shares will vest on reaching each of the share prices of 52p, 56p and 58p. 
this part of the option can be exercised in three annual instalments, assuming that the relevant share price target has been reached 
by the end of each year (otherwise, the option can be exercised after three years to the extent that the targets have subsequently 
been reached by that time). as at the 25 March 2011, two of the three share price targets had been met. a quarter of the 1.8 million 
shares will vest on reaching each of the share prices of 60p, 62.5p, 70p and 90p. t o the extent that these share price targets are met, 
this part of the option can be exercised after three years. for each part of the option, each share price target has to be sustained 
over a consecutive 60 day period in order for the relevant part of the option to vest. other than as set out above, the vesting and 
exercise terms applying to the option are the same as if it had been granted under the psp . 
the option is not pensionable and, in the event of a variation in the company's share capital, the number of shares subject to the 
option and the share price targets can be adjusted, as determined by the Board. the company will not amend the terms of the 
option which relate to the number of shares subject to the option, the basis for determining Guy's right to exercise the option or 
the adjustment provisions without shareholder approval.
the terms of the option are set out in an addendum to the rules of the psp and will be on display at the 2011 annual General 
Meeting for at least 15 minutes before and during the meeting.
SaYE 
the committee established in July 2008 a savings related share option scheme (the  sa Ye'), as approved by HM revenue & customs, 
which was offered to all employees within the Group. certain information relating to the sa Ye was set out in the remuneration report 
contained in the company's 2008 annual report and accounts which was approved by shareholders at the company's annual 
General Meeting in 2008. options under the sa Ye are exercisable three years from the commencement of the relevant savings 
contract and not more than six months thereafter. these incentive arrangements reward participants if shareholder value is created, 
thereby aligning the interests of executive Directors and employees with those of shareholders. 
on 3 July 2008, Jonathan prentis was granted an option under the sa Ye in respect of 50,321 ordinary shares. this option will vest 
on 1 september 2011 with an option price of 18.68 pence per share, subject to continued employment at the date of vesting, and 
will lapse on 1 March 2012.
it is expected that the company will offer further options under the sa Ye in the course of 2011.
this report was approved by the Board of Directors on 18 May 2011.
