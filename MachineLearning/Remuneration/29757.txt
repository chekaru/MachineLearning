Chairman's Introduction to the Remuneration Report
I am pleased to present the Report of the Remuneration Committee for 2013, which sets out the remuneration paid to the 
directors in the financial year ended 29 March 2013 and the policy for the forthcoming year.
In 2012 the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS ) announced a programme of legislative reforms to executive 
pay. These proposals will change the way that we are required to report to you on directors' remuneration in the future and the 
Remuneration Committee has agreed to adopt some of the key requirements in advance of the formal regulations coming into 
force. The Report therefore follows a new structure this year (and includes this summary statement) which the Committee hopes 
you will find informative.
The work of the Remuneration Committee in 2013 was influenced by the shareholder vote in respect of the Remuneration Report 
at the 2012 AGM where 76.2% of votes cast were in favour of the resolution to approve the Report. Following the AGM, the 
Committee sought feedback from the Company's major shareholders. This feedback indicated that the votes against the Report 
were largely as a result of an objection to the single performance condition required under the Performance Share Plan (PSP ), 
which was based on the share price exceeding certain pre-determined targets for at least sixty consecutive days at any time 
during the three year vesting period. The Committee considered the points raised by shareholders and decided to change the 
performance conditions for future PSP awards so that they are more similar to those in other FTSE companies' equivalent plans. 
The Committee aims to ensure that the remuneration policies of the Company are in line with the BIS proposals, whereby: 
Directors should not be rewarded for failure and incentives for senior management should be closely linked to performance, thus 
aligning the interests of executives and shareholders; and Directors' rewards should be correlated with those received by other 
employees of the business. The Committee believes that the Company's remuneration system conforms with these objectives 
whilst retaining and attracting individuals capable of promoting the success of the business. 
Alignment between the senior management and shareholders is also significantly increased by personal shareholdings. Directors, 
senior managers and colleagues own in aggregate over 8% of the issued share capital of the Company.
The Committee is of the view that we have a structure of reasonable base pay, bonuses and long term incentives which are 
aligned to the creation of shareholder value. 
The Committee believes that this remuneration system is simple to understand, has a proven track record of encouraging strong 
performance, does not reward failure and reflects the Company's goal of creating value for shareholders.
Moreover, we believe that the remuneration policy and incentive framework in place is working well to support the Company's 
strategy, is helping to retain and motivate our management team and is helping to drive strong returns for our shareholders. 
We look forward to hearing your views in the future and hope to receive your continued support at this year's AGM.
On behalf of the Board

Role of the Committee
The Remuneration Committee has defined Terms of Reference which were reviewed in May 2011 and can be found in the 
Investor Relations/l egal Documents section of the Group's website. A copy may be obtained from the Company Secretary. The 
Remuneration Committee advises the Board and makes recommendations to it:
  on the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors and senior executives including remuneration, share incentives and 
other benefits;

Committee interaction with stakeholders
The Committee actively engages with shareholders on remuneration matters. In November 2012, the Chairman of the Committee 
approached major shareholders outlining potential changes to future PSP performance conditions. Meetings and conference 
calls were held with many of them, as well as shareholder representative organisations, at which details of the changes were 
discussed.

External Advisors
PricewaterhouseCoopers ll P (PwC ) at the request of the Committee provided benchmarking information on executive 
remuneration and advice in relation to the operation of the Company's PSP. PwC did not provide any other services to the Group 
during the year. 
Policy: Remuneration policy for the 2014 financial year
In this forward-looking section we describe our reward principles along with a description of the elements of the reward package 
and an indication of the future value of this package for each of the Executive Directors.
Key remuneration principles
The principles supporting the Executive Directors' reward package are reviewed each year to ensure that they continue to 
underpin the Group's strategy. 
The Committee's overall policy is to provide competitive and potentially rewarding remuneration packages. The Company wishes 
to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and senior management of the requisite quality. Accordingly, the Committee's 
policy, in a competitive market, is to design remuneration packages which reward Executive Directors and senior employees 
fairly for their individual contribution. The Committee will take into account the pay and employment conditions of other Group 
employees when determining Executive Directors' remuneration, particularly when determining base salary increases.  26

Fixed and variable pay mix
Individual reward elements for all Executive Directors (excluding Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, who does not participate in 
any incentive schemes) are designed to provide a balance between fixed remuneration and variable at risk  reward, linked to 
the performance of the Company. Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, has chosen from the outset not to participate in the bonus 
scheme. The Committee views this as appropriate given the alignment with shareholder interests which arises from his significant 
shareholding in the Company.
The usual pay mix for Executive Directors is as follows at target and maximum levels: Booker Group plc

  Fixed pay comprises base salary and pension contributions (equivalent to 15% of base salary). Benefits are excluded. 
  variable pay comprises the annual bonus and the long term incentive opportunity delivered via the PSP.
  Target performance assumes Bonus award is at target 50% of salary and PSP award is valued at 75% of salary, measured at 
the time of grant.
  Maximum performance assumes Bonus award is at maximum 100% of salary and PSP award is valued at 150% of salary, 
measured at the time of grant.
Salary and benefits
  Base salary is the only element of remuneration which is pensionable.
  In addition to salary, certain usual benefits are provided to Executive Directors.
  All colleagues are eligible for an annual pay award and in the past year the average pay increase for the Group's employees was 
2.23% year on year. Due to the enlargement of the Group following the acquisition of Makro, the responsibilities and workload of 
the Executive Directors increased. To address this the Committee engaged PwC to conduct a benchmarking review of Executive 
Directors' remuneration and, as a consequence, the base salary of four Executive Directors was increased. Charles Wilson, 
Chief Executive, did not receive a salary increase. The average pay increase year on year of the Executive Directors was 10.87%, 
although following these increases all Executive Directors' salaries remain at or below the median benchmark.
With effect from 1 April 2013, subject to the annual pay rise, the Executive Director's annual salary in relation to the Company will 
be as follows:
Executive Director
2013 
( '000)
Charles Wilson 510
Jonathan Prentis 345
Mark Aylwin 315
Guy Farrant 335

Bonus
The bonus scheme covers Executive Directors, senior managers, branch managers and sales teams, comprising approximately 
1,200 employees of the Group. The aggregate bonus pool is determined each year by the level of improvement in Group EBIT 
year on year (previously EBITDA) and no bonus is paid unless there is an improvement. The maximum bonus achievable for an 
Executive Director is 100% of basic salary. Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, has chosen not to participate in this bonus scheme. The 
Committee views this as appropriate given the alignment with shareholder interests which arises from his significant shareholding in 
the Company. Payments to Executive Directors are based upon a percentage of basic salary and do not form part of pensionable 
earnings. The proportion of the bonus pool accruing to Executive Directors is less than 15%. 
Of the Group's average 9,658 employees (excluding Makro), over 6,000 employees are eligible for a bonus payment based 
on customer satisfaction . Customer satisfaction is measured independently by calling 10,000 customers selected at random 
covering retailers, caterers, delivered and collect across our 172 branches each quarter to ask them to rate key areas of service. 
Around 1,300 logistics employees are eligible for a quarterly bonus payment based on achieving productivity and efficiency 
targets at the site at which they are employed. 
From 2014 the Group's bonus schemes will be extended to cover Makro's employees. 28
Booker Group plc 
annual report & accounts 2013
PSP 
The PSP allows Executive Directors and approximately 900 employees to receive share awards, subject to the achievement of 
performance targets set by the Committee, measured over a three year period. Awards are made annually and, other than in 
exceptional circumstances, will not be more than 150% of annual salary for Executive Directors.
For the 2010/13 and 2011/14 PSP cycle, the performance measures were share price based. Details of structure and outcome 
are set out on page 36.
For the 2012/15 PSP cycle, the Committee resolved to grant maximum awards at 150% of base salary for the Executive Directors. 
vesting for points between Threshold and Maximum will be calculated on a straight line basis, as follows:
  50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute TSR performance target with 25% of this element vesting at 8% growth per 
annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting for 15% growth per annum, when measured over the 3 years from 
the award date.
  50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute EPS performance target with 25% of this element vesting for achieving 
Absolute EPS growth of 6% per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting requiring 12% growth per annum, as 
measured between March 2012 and March 2015.
In setting the TSR performance target, the Committee has taken into account the TSR returns achieved by companies in the 
FTSE350 commencing with the three year period to May 2002 and then walking forward on a weekly basis with the last data point 
being the returns of each company through to July 2012.
There is no re-testing of performance targets under the PSP, and awards lapse if they are not met.
The performance measures for the 2013/16 cycle for the Executive Directors (excluding Charles Wilson) are expected to be similar 
to the 2012/15 PSP cycle.
From 2014 the Group's PSP schemes will be extended to cover Makro's employees.
Pensions 
The Company operates and has open to all permanent employees the Group defined contribution personal pension plan.
As an alternative to the pension arrangement, pensionable pay may be paid into the Executive Directors own personal 
pension arrangement.
The normal retirement age for Executive Directors is 65. 
All Executive Directors are entitled to a pension contribution at the rate of 15% of pensionable pay. Pensionable pay is set at 
the prior year's basic salary. A salary sacrifice arrangement was introduced for the Group Personal Pension Scheme in order to 
maximise benefits available to the Scheme's members. 
Other benefits 
Benefits for Executive Directors comprise car (or car allowance), life cover of four times basic salary, private medical insurance 
and permanent health insurance for themselves and their families. 
Clawback in incentive plans
For awards made from 2013, the Bonus schemes and PSP allow the Committee discretion to claw back bonus and unvested 
share awards in the following circumstances:
  misconduct that causes significant damage or potential damage to the Company's prospects, finances or brand reputation; 
and/or
  actions that lead to material misstatement or restatement of accounts.
This feature helps ensure alignment between executive rewards and shareholder returns.

Executive shareholding requirement
Alignment to shareholder interests is a key element of the Group's remuneration policy which maintains commitment over the 
long term and ensures that the interests of the Executive Directors are aligned with those of shareholders. The Committee 
sets shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors. The current guideline is to build and maintain, over time, a personal (and/
or spousal) holding of shares in the Company equivalent in value to at least the Director's annual base salary. The Executive 
Directors currently meet these guidelines. Details of the share interests of all Directors are shown below. Shares held outright by 
each Executive Director at 29 March 2013 with no restrictions:

Bonus
In 2013 the bonus scheme covered Executive Directors, senior managers, branch managers and sales teams, comprising 
approximately 1,200 employees of the Group. The aggregate bonus pool was determined by the level of improvement in Group 
EBITDA year on year and no bonus would have been paid if there were no improvement. The maximum bonus achievable for 
an Executive Director was 100% of basic salary. Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, has chosen not to participate in this bonus 
scheme, and the Committee views this as appropriate given the alignment with shareholder interests which arises from his

not form part of pensionable earnings.

Participation
As well as the Executive Directors, approximately 900 employees have received PSP options. In addition 1,951 employees 
participate in the 2012 and 1,821 are in the 2011 SAYE scheme (in which the Executive Directors have chosen not to participate).
The high number of employees participating in these schemes is consistent with the Group's policy of ensuring that the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors is aligned with that of the overall workforce and with the interests of shareholders. 
Since 2007, when the reverse takeover of Blueheath was completed and the Company became admitted to trading on AIM, the 
equity value of the Company has increased from approximately  300m to over  2,100m. The value of the PSP options awarded 
has been equivalent to 2% of the value generated.

REMUNERATION REPORT
Other matters
Performance Graph
The Company's performance from 28 March 2008 to 29 March 2013 measured by Total Shareholder Return ( TSR'), is compared 
in the chart below with the performance of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) and FTSE AIM All Share Index. 
These are considered the most appropriate indices against which to measure performance following the reverse acquisition 
of Blueheath in June 2007, which was at that time listed on AIM, the Company's admission to listing on the Official l ist and to 
trading on the l ondon Stock Exchange plc's main market for listed securities in July 2009 and its inclusion in the FTSE 250 Index 
in December 2009. 
TSR is defined as the return a shareholder would receive if they held a notional number of shares and received dividends over 
a period of time. Assuming dividends are reinvested into the Company's shares, it measures the percentage growth in the 
Company's share price together with any dividends paid. 
Non-Executive Directors' pay policy and structure
Determination of fee levels
The Non-Executive Directors are paid a fixed fee. The Board has determined that the time commitment of Non-Executive 
Directors should be 12 days per annum, other than the Chairman whose time commitment should be 24 days per annum. The 
time commitment for Non-Executive Directors is set out in the relevant Non-Executive Director's letter of appointment. 
The Non-Executive Directors do not receive bonuses or pension contributions and are not entitled to participate in any of the 
Company's share schemes. They are entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred by them in carrying out their 
duties as Directors of the Company. Fees for the Non-Executive Directors (other than the Chairman) are determined by the 
Chairman and the Executive Directors, having regard to fees paid to Non-Executive Directors in other comparable UK quoted 
companies, the time commitment and responsibilities of the role.

Service Contracts
Notice periods
The Board's policy is that service contracts of Executive Directors should provide for termination by the Company on not more 
than twelve months' notice. 
The service contracts of each of the current Executive Directors provide for such a period of notice. 
Termination
None of the contracts (except for Charles Wilson's contract) provides for specific contractual termination payments other than 
payment in lieu of notice. Under Charles Wilson's contract, in the event of a change of control of the Company, Charles Wilson 
has the right to terminate his employment on 30 days' notice and to receive a payment equal to his gross salary for his contractual 
notice period. 
It is the Committee's policy to ensure that a Director's duty to mitigate his loss is taken into account in the calculation of any 
termination payments.
The Company's approach to the termination of contracts of service of Executive Directors is dictated by the relevant events, 
bearing in mind the circumstances of termination and the interests of the Company. 
External appointments 
Executive Directors are not permitted to hold directorships or offices of companies whose shares are listed on a recognised stock 
exchange and, accordingly, no Executive Director serves as a Non-Executive Director of any such company.
Non-Executive Directors' letters of appointment
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for an initial period of 3 years subject to termination on one month's notice. In 
addition, the Code requires that all Non-Executive Directors stand for re-election annually. Non-Executive Director appointments 
are also subject to the Articles of Association of the Company.
The table below summarises the dates of appointment and most recent re-election dates for the Chairman and each of the Non-
Executive Directors serving as at 29 March 2013.

REMUNERATION REPORT
PSP options granted in 2010
In October 2010, the Company made awards under the PSP in relation to a total of 11.3m new Ordinary Shares. 
The options granted will vest and become exercisable three years from the date of the award subject to continued employment and 
the performance conditions mentioned below being satisfied and will lapse if not exercised within ten years of the date of award. 
A quarter of each option will vest on reaching each of the share prices of 60p, 62.5p, 70p and 90p, in each case sustained over 
a consecutive 60-day period. As at 29 March 2013, all of the four share price targets had been met.
In October 2010, Guy Farrant was granted a special performance share award (in the form of a nil-cost option) over 3.9 million 
Ordinary Shares in the Company ( the Option'). The Option was granted specifically in connection with Guy's appointment as a 
Director. Additional information about the Option can be found in the Company's 2011 Annual Report and Accounts which was 
approved by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting in 2011. 
The Option is in two parts: one part relates to 2.1 million Ordinary Shares in the Company and the other part relates to 1.8 million 
Ordinary Shares in the Company. A third of the 2.1 million shares will vest on reaching each of the share prices of 52p, 56p and 
58p. This part of the Option can be exercised in three annual instalments, assuming that the relevant share price target has been 
reached by the end of each year (otherwise, the Option can be exercised after three years to the extent that the targets have 
subsequently been reached by that time). As at 29 March 2013, all three of the share price targets had been met. 
A quarter of the 1.8 million shares will vest on reaching each of the share prices of 60p, 62.5p, 70p and 90p. To the extent that 
these share price targets are met, this part of the Option can be exercised after three years. For each part of the Option, each 
share price target has to be sustained over a consecutive 60 day period in order for the relevant part of the Option to vest. Other 
than as set out above, the vesting and exercise terms applying to the Option are the same as if it had been granted under the 
PSP. As at 29 March 2013, all four of the share price targets had been met.
PSP options granted in 2011
In November 2011, the Company made awards under the PSP in relation to a total of 7.0m new Ordinary Shares. 
The options granted will vest and become exercisable three years from the date of the award subject to continued employment 
and the performance conditions mentioned below being satisfied and will lapse if not exercised within ten years of the date of 
award. A fifth of each option will vest on reaching each of the share prices of 85.8p, 89.4p, 100.1p. 128.7p and 153.0p, in each 
case sustained over a consecutive 60-day period.
As at 29 March 2013, three of the five share price targets had been met.
PSP options granted in 2012
In November 2012, the Company made awards under the PSP in relation to a total of 6.3m new Ordinary Shares.
As a result of concerns expressed by shareholders during 2012, the Committee decided to review the structure of the PSP 
performance conditions so that they were more in line with equivalent plans used by other FTSE companies. 
As a result new performance conditions relating to the 2012 PSP awards were adopted and will apply as follows:
  50% of each award would be linked to an Absolute TSR performance target with 25% of this element vesting at 8% growth 
per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting for 15% growth per annum, when measured over the 3 years from 
the award date.
  50% of each award would be linked to an Absolute EPS performance target with 25% of this element vesting for achieving 
Absolute EPS growth of 6% per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting requiring 12% growth per annum, as 
measured between March 2012 and March 2015.
The options granted will vest and become exercisable three years from the date of award, subject to continued employment and 
the performance conditions outlined above being satisfied and will lapse if not exercised within 10 years of the date of award.
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 22 May 2013.
