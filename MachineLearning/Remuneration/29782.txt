REMUNERATION REPORT
Chairman's Introduction to the Remuneration Report
I am pleased to present the Report of the Remuneration Committee for 2014, which sets out the remuneration paid to the 
Directors in the financial year ended 28 March 2014 and the policy for the forthcoming year.
This year sees the introduction of a binding shareholder vote on the Directors' Remuneration Policy (see pages 34 to 42) in addition 
to the advisory vote on the Annual Report on Directors' Remuneration (see pages 43 to 48). The format of the Remuneration 
Report is broadly the same as last year, the Remuneration Committee having agreed to adopt some of the key requirements of 
the then draft new rules in advance of the formal regulations coming into force this year.
Our Remuneration Policy remains largely unchanged from last year. In presenting the policy, the Committee aims to ensure 
that the remuneration policies of the Company are in line with the new regulations, whereby: Directors should not be rewarded 
for failure and incentives for Directors and executives should be closely linked to performance, thus aligning the interests of 
Directors, executives and shareholders; and Directors' rewards should be correlated with those received by other employees of 
the business. The Committee believes that the Company's remuneration system conforms with these objectives whilst retaining 
and attracting individuals capable of promoting the success of the business. 
Alignment between the Directors, executives and shareholders is also significantly increased by personal shareholdings. Directors, 
executives and colleagues own in aggregate over 7% of the issued share capital of the Company outright. 
The Committee is of the view that we have a structure of reasonable base pay, bonuses and long term incentives which are 
aligned to the creation of shareholder value. We are satisfied that the outcomes have reflected business performance.
The Committee believes that this remuneration system has a proven track record of encouraging strong performance, does not 
reward failure and reflects the Company's overall goal of creating value for shareholders.
Moreover, we believe that the remuneration policy and incentive framework in place is working well to support the Company's 
strategy, is helping to retain and motivate our management team and is helping to drive strong returns for our shareholders. 
The Board recommends this Directors' Remuneration Policy to shareholders. It will provide the framework to allow us to recruit, 
motivate and retain the talent the Company needs and to ensure the alignment of executive remuneration with the creation of 
value for shareholders.
We look forward to hearing your views in the future and hope to receive your continued support at this year's AGM.
This Remuneration Report was approved by the Board on 21 May 2014.

Role of the Committee
The Remuneration Committee has defined Terms of Reference which were reviewed in November 2013 and can be found in the 
Investor Relations/Investor Centre/Legal Documents section of the Group's website. A copy may be obtained from the Company 
Secretary. The Remuneration Committee advises the Board and makes recommendations to it:
  on the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors and executives including remuneration, share incentives and  
other benefits;
  on the terms of service contracts with Executive Directors and executives and any compensation arrangements resulting from 
the termination of an Executive Director or executive's service contract; and 
  concerning the grant and vesting of awards under the PSP.
Membership
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Karen Jones and also comprises Lord Bilimoria and Andrew Cripps, all of whom 
are independent Non-Executive Directors. Details of the skills and experience of the Directors are contained in the Directors' 
biographies on pages 18 and 19. Their remuneration is set out later in this Report. The quorum necessary for the transaction 
of business is two, each of whom must be a Non-Executive Director. Only members of the Committee have the right to attend 
committee meetings, however, during the year, Richard Rose (Chairman), Charles Wilson (Chief Executive), Jonathan Prentis 
(Group Finance Director) and the Group Human Resources director were invited to attend meetings (although never during the 
discussion of any item affecting their own remuneration or employment). 
The Company Secretary is Secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
Meeting Frequency and Main Activities in the Year
The Remuneration Committee met five times during the year ended 28 March 2014 to:
  Approve the 2013 bonus; 
  Review and approve the Remuneration Report for 2013;
  Consider the 2014 Pay Award Strategy;
  Review Executive Directors' and other executives' remuneration packages; 
  Consider auto-enrolment for employees in the Group's pension scheme; 
  Consider, approve and adopt the performance conditions for 2013/16 and future PSP awards; 
  Provide an update upon the Committee Chairman's meetings and conference calls with shareholders;
  Consider the Remuneration Report for 2014; and
  Consider the bonus scheme for 2015.
Since 28 March 2014, the Remuneration Committee met twice to:
  Approve the 2014 bonus;
  Review and approve the Remuneration Report for 2014;
  Consider and approve the 2015 Pay Award Strategy;

Key Remuneration Principles
The principles supporting the Executive Directors' reward packages are reviewed each year to ensure that they continue to 
underpin the Group's strategy. 
The Committee's overall policy is to provide competitive and potentially rewarding remuneration packages. The Company 
wishes to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and executives of the requisite quality. Accordingly, the Committee's 
policy, in a competitive market, is to design remuneration packages which reward Executive Directors and executives fairly for 
their contribution. The Committee will take into account the pay and employment conditions of other Group employees when 
determining Executive Directors' remuneration, particularly when determining base salary increases.  34

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Directors' Remuneration Policy
The policy for Executive Directors, set out below, will apply from the date of the 2014 AGM (subject to approval), and is  
available to view in the Investor Relations/Investor Centre/Legal Documents section of the Group's website. A copy may be 
obtained from the Company Secretary.
The Committee will consider the remuneration policy annually to ensure that it continues to underpin the Group's strategy. It 
is, however, intended that the policy set out below will apply for three years from the 2014 AGM. Shareholders will be asked to 
approve any amendments to the policy during that three year period.

Recognises the 
market value of 
the role and the

Reviewed annually and fixed for  
12 months from 1 April. 
Committee considers:
  Business and individual performance;
   Current remuneration against internal  
and external benchmarks; and
   Average salary increases for the wider 
Company workforce.
When external benchmarking is used,  
the comparator groups are chosen  
having regard to:
   Size - market capitalisation, turnover, 
profits and the number of employees;
  Diversity and complexity of the business.
Over the policy period, salaries for current 
Executive Directors will broadly increase in 
line with the range of increases applying to 
the employee population, other than where 
there is a change in role or responsibility, 
where there are major changes within 
the Group or where a significant variance 
to the market arises, that warrants a 
more significant increase, or where the 
Committee judges that there is a risk in 
relation to attracting or retaining Executive 
Directors. Any such changes, should they 
occur, will be fully explained to shareholders 
in the next Remuneration Report.
Newly promoted or recruited Executive 
Directors may on occasion have their 
salaries set below the benchmark policy 
level while they become established in the 
role. In such cases, salary increases may be 
higher than the employee population until 
the target positioning is achieved.

Reviewed annually. Vesting is confirmed 
by the Committee after the end of the 
vesting period. The Committee will review 
the vesting outcomes of the performance 
targets at the end of each three-year cycle 
against an assessment of Group earnings 
and the quality of financial performance 
over the period, including sustainable 
growth and the efficient use of cash and 
capital. If the Committee determines that 
the vesting outcomes do not appropriately 
reflect the financial performance of the 
Group, it may add to or reduce the number 
of shares that vests, provided that in no 
case will an award exceed the maximum 
opportunity stated.
Malus applies to awards. See page 38  
for details.
Maximum award for 2014/17 PSP cycle 
is 150% of salary. The Committee has 
no current intention to award more than 
the policy maximum, but if exceptional 
and unforeseen circumstances arise that 
warrant it, the Committee has discretion to 
increase this to 400% of salary under the 
PSP rules. 
Any such award will be fully explained  
to shareholders in the next Remuneration 
Report.
The measures are  
as follows:
a)  50% absolute TSR 
performance target:
   25% threshold  
vesting at 8%  
growth per annum;
   maximum vesting 
for 15% growth per 
annum; and
   straight line vesting

   25% threshold  
vesting at 6%  
growth per annum; 
   maximum vesting

the performance 
of the Company's 
shares.
Executive Directors may participate on 
the same terms as other employees. The 
option price may be discounted by up to 
20% on the date of grant. Accumulated 
savings may be used to exercise an option

Notes to Future Policy Table
Bonus 
The Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT ) bonus scheme, which is consistent with the FY14 bonus scheme, covers Executive 
Directors, executives, branch managers and sales teams, comprising approximately 1,700 colleagues of the Group. The aggregate 
bonus pool is determined each year by the level of improvement in Group EBIT year on year and no bonus is paid unless 
there is an improvement. The maximum bonus achievable for an Executive Director is 100% of basic salary. Charles Wilson, 
Chief Executive, does not participate in this bonus scheme. The Committee views this as appropriate given the alignment with 
shareholder interests which arise from his significant shareholding in the Company. Payments to Executive Directors are based 
upon a percentage of basic salary and do not form part of pensionable earnings. The proportion of the bonus pool accruing to 
Executive Directors is less than 15%. 
PSP 
The PSP scheme allows Executive Directors and approximately 1,000 employees to receive share awards, subject to the 
achievement of performance targets set by the Committee, measured over a three year period. Awards are made annually and, 
other than in exceptional circumstances, will not be more than 150% of annual salary for Executive Directors.
For the 2011/14 PSP cycle, the performance measures were share price based. Details of structure and outcome are set out on 
page 44.
For the 2012/15 and 2013/16 PSP cycle, the Committee resolved to grant maximum awards at 150% of base salary for the 
Executive Directors. Vesting for points between Threshold and Maximum will be calculated on a straight line basis, as follows:
  50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute TSR performance target with 25% of this element vesting at 8% growth per 
annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting for 15% growth per annum, when measured over the 3 years from 
the award date.
Directors' Remuneration Policy continued
Future Policy Table continued 37
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
  50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute EPS performance target with 25% of this element vesting for achieving 
Absolute EPS growth of 6% per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting requiring 12% growth per annum, as 
measured between March 2012 and March 2015 and March 2013 and March 2016.
In setting the TSR performance target, the Committee has taken into account the TSR returns achieved by companies in the 
FTSE350 commencing with the three year period to May 2002 and then walking forward on a weekly basis with the last data point 
being the returns of each company through to July 2012.
There is no re-testing of performance targets under the PSP, and awards lapse if they are not met.
The performance measures for the 2014/17 cycle for the Executive Directors (excluding Charles Wilson) are expected to be similar 
to the 2013/16 PSP cycle.
Fixed and Variable Pay Mix
Individual reward elements for all Executive Directors (excluding Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, who does not participate in 
any incentive schemes) are designed to provide a balance between fixed remuneration and variable at risk  reward, linked to 
the performance of the Company. Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, has chosen from the outset not to participate in the bonus 
scheme. The Committee views this as appropriate given the alignment with shareholder interests which arises from his significant 
shareholding in the Company.
Illustrative scenarios
Below is an illustration of the value that could be received by each Executive Director under the Directors' Remuneration Policy 
in respect of 2015, showing:
  minimum, which comprises base salary, benefits and employer pension contributions only (equivalent to 15% of base salary) 
(total fixed pay);
  on-target, which includes total fixed pay and assumes an on-target award for the Bonus (50% of salary) and 50% of maximum 
PSP vesting; 
  maximum, which includes total fixed pay and a maximum award under the Bonus (100% of salary) and 100% of maximum 
PSP vesting; 
  the salaries included are those that will apply from 1 April 2014. The benefit values included are estimates. The amounts shown 
in relation to Bonus and PSP do not take account of any share price appreciation or depreciation; and
  the PSP vesting is calculated using a share price of 166.7p being the closing share price on 28 March 2014.

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Directors' Remuneration Policy continued
Use of Discretion by Remuneration Committee
Malus in Incentive Plans
The Committee has the discretion under both the Bonus scheme and the PSP to claw back bonus and unvested share awards 
in the following circumstances:
  misconduct that causes significant damage or potential damage to the Company's prospects, finances or brand reputation; 
and/or
  actions that lead to material misstatement or restatement of accounts.
This feature helps ensure alignment between executive rewards and shareholder returns.
Other Uses of Discretion
The Committee will operate the Company's incentive plans according to their respective rules, the policy set out in the table above 
and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant.
The Committee retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of the incentive plans. These 
include, but are not limited to, determining who participates in the incentive plans, the time and size of awards, measurement of 
performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction and the adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. 
rights issues, corporate restructuring, on a change of control and special dividends). The discretions that can be applied in the 
case of leavers under the Bonus and PSP are set out in the section on  Policy on Payment for Loss of Office' on page 39.
Any exercises of discretion by the Committee will be fully disclosed and explained in the relevant year's Remuneration Report.
The Committee will also use its judgement as to what is appropriate within the terms of the Directors' Remuneration Policy,  
to make decisions that do not involve the exercise of discretion.
Approach to Recruitment Remuneration
The remuneration of any new Executive Director will be determined in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Policy and 
the elements that would be considered by the Company for inclusion are:
   salary and benefits, including defined contribution pension participation and relocation costs, where appropriate;
   participation in the Bonus: pro-rated for the year of recruitment to reflect the proportion of the year remaining after the date of 
commencement of employment. 
   participation in the PSP: awards would be granted on the same terms and subject to the same performance conditions as 
those which apply to PSP awards granted to existing Executive Directors in the year of recruitment.
The maximum annual level of variable remuneration that may be granted to a newly recruited Executive Director (excluding any 
awards to compensate for incentives forgone on recruitment) would be in line with that of the existing Executive Directors:
   Bonus award: maximum 100% of salary; and
    PSP award: maximum 400% of salary for a full PSP cycle commencing after appointment, plus pro-rated awards in relation to 
PSP cycles outstanding at the time of recruitment (up to a further 150% of salary).
In addition, the Committee may, in its discretion, compensate a newly recruited Executive Director for incentives forgone from 
a previous employment as a result of their resignation. The Committee would seek validation of the value of any potential 
incentives forgone.
Awards made by way of compensation for incentives forgone would be made on a comparable basis, taking account of 
performance achieved (or likely to be achieved), the proportion of the performance period remaining and the form of the award. 
Compensation would, as far as possible, be in the form of awards under the PSP in order to immediately align a new Executive 
Director with Company performance. 39
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Policy on Payment for Loss of Office
Contractual Notice Period and Pay in Lieu
All current Executive Directors have a rolling service contract with a notice period from the company of 12 months. As an 
alternative, the Company may, at its discretion, pay in lieu of that notice. Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice will be given 
in the event of gross misconduct.
Payment in lieu of notice could potentially include up to 12 months' salary and the cash equivalent of 12 months' pension 
contributions, and other contractual benefits. Where possible, the Company will seek to ensure that where a leaver mitigates 
their losses by, for example, finding new employment, there will be a corresponding reduction in compensation payable for loss 
of office. The Company's approach to the termination of contracts of service of Executive Directors is dictated by the relevant 
events, bearing in mind the circumstances of termination and the interests of the Company. A bonus element is not normally 
included in the termination payment, however, if the Company enforces the non-compete clause, up to 12 months on target 
bonus will be payable.
An Executive Director may have an entitlement to compensation in respect of their statutory rights under relevant employment 
legislation in the UK.
Under Charles Wilson's contract, in the event of a change of control of the Company, Charles Wilson has the right to terminate his 
employment on 30 days' notice and to receive a payment equal to his gross salary for his contractual notice period. 
Termination by Mutual Agreement
In certain circumstances it can be in the best interests of the Company for the Board to proactively manage succession planning 
and the development of the senior talent pipeline. In such circumstances, the Board may agree that an executive's departure will 
be by mutual agreement. In order for this to apply, the Committee will need to be satisfied that the executive has demonstrated 
performance in line with expectations and where required they should have contributed to an orderly succession. The Company's 
experience is that this approach is successful and has previously enabled the Company to recruit a former Executive Director to 
lead Makro on an interim basis immediately after its acquisition.
An Executive Director terminated by mutual agreement will be treated as a good leaver  for the purposes of the Bonus and PSP 
plans. If the termination date falls during the financial year, they will be eligible to be paid a pro-rated on target bonus and if they 
are employed at the end of the financial year, the bonus payable would be based on actual results.
Other than as set out above, the Committee does not anticipate using the discretion provided by the Bonus and PSP plan  
rules in respect of termination payments. There may, however, be unforeseen circumstances where this is in the best interests  
of the Company and its shareholders. Where such discretion is exercised, explanations will be provided in the next 
Remuneration Report. 40

The Committee would only exercise the discretions available in the Bonus and PSP plan rules relating to:
  whether an award is made or an unvested award forfeited; and
   the extent and timing of any such award or forfeiture in exceptional circumstances, for example permanent disablement.
Notice periods would not usually be included when calculating the pro-rata amount of Bonus and PSP awards that vest. The 
Committee would only exercise its discretion to include some or all of the notice period in such calculation in exceptional 
circumstances, such as ill health, and would not do so in circumstances of poor performance.
The Committee has the discretion to determine that an individual should be treated as a Good Leaver for the purposes of the 
PSP. In exercising such discretion the Committee will consider factors such as personal performance and conduct, overall Group 
performance and the specific circumstances of the Executive Director's departure including, but not restricted to, whether the 
Executive Director is leaving by mutual agreement with the Company. If an individual is not a Good Leaver then they will be treated 
as an Other Leaver, as set out above.
Committee Interaction with Stakeholders
The Committee engages with shareholders on remuneration matters. Discussions were held with a number of shareholders and 
with shareholder representative organisations over the year.
Legacy Arrangements
The Committee reserves the right to honour any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office not in line with the policy 
set out above where the terms of those payments were (i) entered into with current or former directors before this policy came 
into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant executive was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, 
the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. 
For these purposes payments  includes payments of variable remuneration under the Bonus scheme and the PSP in line with 
the terms of the payment agreed at the time the award was granted.
The Committee may make minor changes to this policy, which do not have a material advantage to Directors, to aid its operation 
or implementation taking into account the interests of shareholders but without the need to seek shareholder approval. 41
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Consideration of Employment Conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee takes into consideration the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group when determining 
remuneration for its Executive Directors. 
Salary increases for Executive Directors will broadly increase in line with the general workforce other than when there is a change 
in role or responsibility, or a significant variance to the market arises, warranting a larger increase.
Newly promoted or recruited Executive Directors to the Board may, on occasion, have their salaries set below the benchmark 
policy level while they become established in role. In such cases, salary increases may be higher than the general workforce until 
the target positioning is achieved.
Group employees' salaries are compared to cross-industry standards to ensure fair pay for that job. The Company does 
not directly consult with employees as part of the process of determining Directors' remuneration. While formal comparison 
measurements were not used in determining Executive Director remuneration, the Committee made decisions in the knowledge 
of incentive arrangements of the rest of the Group, upon which the Committee is briefed regularly.
Remuneration Policy for Other Employees
The Company's policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors is consistent with that of other senior employees. This group of 
approximately 1,700 people also participates in and receives payments under the EBIT Bonus scheme. Eligibility to participate in 
the PSP extends to a similar set of around 1,000 employees in total.
Outside the senior employees' group, the composition of remuneration differs. Of the Group's average 13,000 employees, 
over 9,000 employees are eligible for a bonus payment based on customer satisfaction . Customer satisfaction is measured 
independently by calling 10,000 customers selected at random covering retailers, caterers, delivered and collect across our 202 
branches each quarter to ask them to rate key areas of service. 
Around 1,300 logistics employees are eligible for a quarterly bonus payment based on achieving productivity and efficiency 
targets at the site at which they are employed. 
In addition from time to time certain incentive arrangements may be introduced for executives and colleagues in order to achieve 
particular objectives.
Eligibility for, and participation in, benefits and incentive plans differs depending on location, seniority, length of service and other factors.
Service Contracts and Notice Periods for Executive Directors
The Committee's policy is for all Executive Directors to have rolling service contracts with a notice period of 12 months. All new 
appointments will have 12-month notice periods, unless, on an exceptional basis to complete an external recruitment successfully, 
a longer initial notice period reducing to 12 months is used.
This is in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
All Executive Directors' appointments and subsequent re-appointments are subject to election and annual re-election by 
shareholders at the AGM.
Details of Current Executive Directors' Contracts
The table below summarises the service contracts of the Executive Directors.

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Directors' Remuneration Policy continued
External Appointments 
Executive Directors are not permitted to hold directorships or offices of companies whose shares are listed on a recognised stock 
exchange and, accordingly, no Executive Director serves as a Non-Executive Director of any such company.
Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors
The policy for Non-Executive Directors will apply for three years from the date of the 2014 AGM (subject to approval), and is 
available to view in the Investor Relations/Legal Documents section of the Group's website. A copy may be obtained from the 
Company Secretary.
Shareholders will be asked to approve any changes to the policy during that three year period. The Non-Executive Directors do 
not receive bonuses or pension contributions and are not entitled to participate in any of the Company's share schemes.

Non-Executive Directors' fees and benefits are set by 
the Chairman of the Board and Executive Directors;  
the Chairman's fees are set by the Committee.
Fees are reviewed annually and fixed for 12 months from 1 April.
Consideration is given to:
   Business performance;
   The time commitment and responsibilities of the role;
   Current remuneration against external  
benchmarks; and
   Average salary increases for the wider 
Company workforce.
When external benchmarking is used, the  
comparator groups are chosen having regard to:
   Size - market capitalisation, turnover, profits  
and the number of employees;
  Diversity and complexity of the business.
An additional fee is paid for acting as chairman of a  
committee and for representation on a committee.
   Fee increases 
would be in line 
with median FTSE

The Board has determined that the time commitment of Non-Executive Directors should be 12 days per annum, other than the 
Chairman whose time commitment should be 24 days per annum. The time commitment for Non-Executive Directors is set out 
in the relevant Non-Executive Director's letter of appointment. 
Non-Executive Directors are entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred by them in carrying out their duties as 
Directors of the Company. 
Details of Letters of Appointment and Notice Periods for Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for an initial period of 3 years subject to termination on one month's 
notice. In addition, the UK Corporate Governance Code requires that all Non-Executive Directors stand for re-election annually.  
Non-Executive Director appointments are also subject to the Articles of Association of the Company.

Notes to Single total figure of remuneration - Executive Directors
  Salary - salary received in the year.
  Taxable benefits - all taxable benefits in kind arising from the individual's employment in 2013.
  Bonus - the bonus relating to the Company's performance in 2013, paid in 2014.
  PSP - Based on the share price at the date of actual vesting.
  No PSP options were awarded to Directors in 2009. This was considered and reflected in determining the value of the 
award granted in the following year. All performance conditions attached to these awards were met in full and the awards 
subsequently vested in October 2013. Guy Farrant received a  signing-on bonus' including a special performance award in 
October 2010, part of which vested in 2012 with the remainder vesting in 2013. 
  Pension Benefits - the value of Company contributions to pension plans or any cash allowances paid in lieu of  
pension contributions.
  No consideration was paid to third parties for making available the services of any person as a Director of the Company during the year. 
Bonus (audited information)
The level of pre-bonus earnings before interest and tax (EBIT ) achieved in 2014 gave rise to the following awards to the  
Executive Directors:
Director EBIT award as % of salary
Jonathan Prentis 61.20%
Mark Aylwin 61.20%
Guy Farrant 61.20%
Bryn Satherley 61.20%
The EBIT bonus scheme covers approximately 1,700 colleagues, including the Executive Directors, (other than Charles Wilson). 
The scheme has been in operation since 2007 (albeit that up to 2012 it was based on increases in earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation) and is targeted on increasing the Group EBIT year on year. The Group EBIT increase of  22.5m to 
 120.4m resulted in a bonus being awarded to Executive Directors of 61.20% of salary. The maximum bonus payable under the 
scheme to Executive Directors was 100% of salary, had the Group EBIT exceeded  134.6m, an uplift on prior year of  36.7m. If 
EBIT had not increased year on year no bonus would have been paid. Bonus is paid on basic salary as at 31 March each year. The 
proportion of the total scheme bonus pool accruing to Executive Directors was less than 15%, in accordance with the Company's 
Directors' Remuneration Policy. 44

Participation
As well as the Executive Directors, approximately 1,000 employees have been granted PSP options. In addition 3,449 employees 
participate in the 2013 SAYE scheme, 1,751 employees participate in the 2012 SAYE scheme and 2,136 participate in the 2011 
SAYE scheme. The Executive Directors have chosen not to participate in any of the current SAYE schemes. 
The high number of employees participating in these schemes is consistent with the Group's policy of ensuring that the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors is aligned with that of the overall workforce and with the interests of shareholders. 
Since 2007, when the reverse takeover of Blueheath was completed and the Company became admitted to trading on AIM, the 
equity value of the Company has increased from approximately  300m to over  2.6bn as at 21 May. The value of the PSP options 
awarded has been equivalent to 2% of the value generated.
Statement of Directors' Shareholdings (audited information)
Alignment to shareholder interests is a key element of the Group's remuneration policy which maintains commitment over the 
long term and ensures that the interests of the Executive Directors are aligned with those of shareholders. The Committee sets 
shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors. The current guideline is to build and maintain, over time, a personal (and/or 
spousal) holding of shares in the Company equivalent in value to at least the Executive Director's annual base salary. All of the 
Executive Directors currently meet these guidelines. Details of the share interests of all Executive Directors are shown below.

Relative Performance Graph
The Company's performance from 27 March 2009 to 28 March 2014 measured by Total Shareholder Return ( TSR'), is compared 
in the chart below with the performance of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) and FTSE AIM All Share Index. 
These are considered the most appropriate indices against which to measure performance following the reverse acquisition 
of Blueheath in June 2007, which was at that time listed on AIM, the Company's admission to listing on the Official List and to 
trading on the London Stock Exchange plc's main market for listed securities in July 2009 and its inclusion in the FTSE 250 Index 
in December 2009. 
TSR is defined as the return a shareholder would receive if they held a notional number of shares and received dividends over 
a period of time. Assuming dividends are reinvested into the Company's shares, it measures the percentage growth in the 
Company's share price together with any dividends paid. 
The closing mid market price of an Ordinary Share on 28 March 2014 was 166.7p and the price range during the year was  
116.4p to 176.5p.

Non-Executive Directors are paid a fee which is agreed by the Executive Directors and the Chairman of the Board, taking into 
account fees paid in other companies of similar complexity. These fees also reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of 
the roles.
Accordingly, higher fees are payable to the Chairman of the Audit Committee (Andrew Cripps) and the Chairman of the 
Remuneration committee (Karen Jones). The Chairman's fees are agreed by the Committee.
Non-Executive Directors' fee levels are reviewed annually.
