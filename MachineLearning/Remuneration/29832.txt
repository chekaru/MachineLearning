 Remuneration committee
The executive directors' remuneration is determined by the remuneration committee. The members of the committee
are the independent non-executive directors, Peter Davis and Julia Walsh, who chairs the committee. Until his
retirement on 30 May 2002, Gerry Mortimer was Chairman of the committee.
The committee meets in order to determine and recommend to the Board the broad policy for the remuneration of
the executive management, with the objective of such policy being to ensure that members of the executive
management of the Group are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are, in
a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Group.
Non-executive remuneration is determined by the main Board. Richard Holland, the Group Chief Executive, attends
meetings of the committee, except when matters concerning his remuneration are being considered. Although the
committee reserves the right to seek independent advice periodically from specialist consultants, no such services
were provided during 2002 which materially assisted their consideration of any matter.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
In determining the remuneration policy, the committee has followed Schedule A to the Combined Code annexed to
the UK Listing Authority's Listing Rules. The committee's policy is to set remuneration packages which incentivise
and retain the executives needed to manage the business in a competitive, international environment. Remuneration
packages consist of base salary, benefits in kind and annual bonus, together with long-term incentives and pension.
Annual remuneration
Subject to the Group sale process, the policy is for executive directors to receive base salaries and benefits and be
further incentivised by the opportunity to receive performance related bonuses equivalent to 100% of base salary for
the Group Chief Executive and 65% of base salary for the other executive directors.
The base salary and benefits (which include provision of a car or car allowance, together with life, disability and health
insurance) for each executive director is reviewed annually by the committee and determined in relation to personal
performance and the market rate for similar jobs in comparable companies.
In assessing the performance criteria to be applied to the bonuses payable for 2003, the committee has taken into
account the sale process with which the Group is involved and reflected this in the application of personal
performance targets for each director, which are at the discretion of the committee. Other specified measurable
targets applicable include Group profit before tax, divisional performance and corporate finance.
The performance targets set for 2003 and the proportion of bonus achievable by each executive director are as
follows:
Bonus as a percentage of base salary
Richard Holland John Christmas John Minch
Target performance
Budgeted profit before tax and corporate debt for the year 50% 45% -
Divisional budgeted profit before tax and budgeted divisional cash/
borrowings for the year - - 45%
Personal targets 50% 20% 20%
Totals 100% 65% 65%
Long-term incentives and share options
Long-term incentives for directors comprise share options, phantom options, shares acquired through a bonus
conversion scheme and, in respect of Mr Minch, shares awarded upon his appointment as a director and held in
trust.
Share options have been granted to both executive directors and other senior executives to strengthen the link
between their personal interests and those of the shareholders. Executive directors' participation in the executive
share option scheme is determined by the remuneration committee. Certain senior executives and executive directors
have been granted phantom options which, when exercised, give rise to cash payments forming part of their
08 BOOSEY & HAWKES PLC
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT emoluments in the year of exercise. All liabilities under this scheme are fully provided. Executive directors have also
participated in the Boosey & Hawkes Sharesave Scheme.
Whilst the Company has been involved in the sale process, which commenced in October 2001, no further share
options have been granted to the executive directors, save for the extension and granting of phantom options to
Richard Holland (as detailed on page 12) in respect of options which could not be exercised because of restrictions
imposed by the Model Code on share dealing.
Prior to the group reorganisation in 1998, performance conditions were not applied to the exercise of executive share
options. Subsequently, executive share options granted under the Company's 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme
have been subject to the condition that the growth in the Company's published earnings per share must have
exceeded the growth in the retail price index by 3% per annum, compound over a three year period prior to their
exercise. Such performance conditions were chosen in common with other companies and following consultation
with the Association of British Insurers (ABI) as an appropriate performance measure. The performance conditions do
not apply in the event of a change of control. Performance conditions have not been applied to phantom options or
to Sharesave Scheme options for which share price performance is considered to be an appropriate measure.
The bonus conversion scheme provides for directors and senior executives to receive an equal number of matching
shares, after three years, in respect of shares in the Company which had been purchased for them using part or all of
their annual bonus. The conditions for the vesting of the shares are that the directors concerned are in the
employment of the Company at the vesting date, except in the event of a change of control when the shares
automatically vest.
Pensions
The UK-based executive directors are members of the Group's UK contributory, defined benefit pension scheme
which, subject to Inland Revenue limits, provides them with a pension of up to two-thirds of earnings, which exclude
bonus payments, together with death in service benefits of four times salary and permanent disability insurance.
Directors who are subject to the earnings cap will have their pension and life assurance benefits, related to earnings
above that level, provided by the Company on an unfunded basis.
Directors' service agreements
Each executive director has a service agreement with entitlement to notice. Richard Holland's service agreement is
terminable by 24 months' notice. The remaining executive directors have service agreements terminable by
12 months' notice. The Board considers that, whilst the sale process continues, it would be inappropriate to make
any amendments to the terms of the executive directors' contracts. The non-executive directors do not have service
contracts but have been issued with letters of appointment.
The executive directors' service contracts do not contain specific provisions for compensation payable upon early
termination. In such an event, the remuneration committee would take into account the prevailing circumstances
when assessing compensation.
