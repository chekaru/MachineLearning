 Pension entitlement
All executive directors in office at 31st March 2003 receive pension entitlements from the company' s principal UK defined benefit
pension scheme, referred to in note 26, and supplementary pension arrangements which provide additional benefits aimed at
producing a pension of two-thirds final base salary at normal retirement age, subject to completing 20 years service. Non-executive
directors are not members of any company pension arrangements. Pension entitlement is calculated only on the salary element 
of remuneration. 
Those directors who are subject to the earnings cap are also members of an unfunded unapproved pension arrangement which
provides similar benefits on basic salary in excess of the earnings cap.

The total accrued pension entitlement for Mr S G Russell, the highest paid director, at 31st March 2002 was  349,000.
The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year. Retained
benefits from previous employments are taken into account. The increase in accrued pension during the year is after deducting the
increase due to inflation, at the rate of 1.7%, on the previous year's accrued pension. Members of the scheme have the option to
pay additional voluntary contributions; neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
Mr B Clare left the company on 31st January 2003 taking a deferred pension in respect of his approved benefits. A payment of
 1.2m was made to him and his dependants in lieu of benefits they had accrued in the unapproved arrangement. The figures at
31st March 2003 relate to approved scheme benefits only.
The year end figures for Mr D A R Thompson are as at 4th September 2002, his date of retirement.
