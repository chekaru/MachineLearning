 Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and meets the relevant requirements of the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the Combined Code.
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2007 inviting them to consider and approve this report.
The auditors are required to report to the Company's members on that part of this remuneration report which is subject to audit and to state whether, in their
opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
This report is therefore presented in two sections: unaudited information and audited information.
Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is made up solely of non-executive directors with no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in the matters to 
be decided. Those non-executive directors serving on the Remuneration Committee throughout 2006 were Mr Mark Nicholls and Mrs Lesley MacDonagh. 
Mr Tim Melville-Ross served until 10 March 2006 and Mr John Warren was appointed to the Committee on 1 March 2006. Mr Warren was subsequently
appointed Chairman of the Committee on 10 March 2006. Mr Colin Holmes was appointed to the Committee on 1 December 2006. Mr Tim Melville-Ross was
appointed non-executive Chairman in November 2005, and as a result, for a small part of 2006 the Group was not compliant with the requirements of the
Combined Code in respect of the Remuneration Committee having only independent directors as members. Meetings of the Remuneration Committee are held
as and when appropriate and at least annually. During 2006, the Remuneration Committee met on four occasions and each meeting was attended by all the
members then current. 
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, from time to time, calls upon Mr Malcolm Harris (Chief Executive) to assist in discussions and deliberations of the Remuneration
Committee on remuneration matters not pertaining to the remuneration or terms and conditions of his own employment. The Remuneration Committee has,
on occasion, appointed the services of external advisers to advise on director remuneration. The Hay Group has been appointed as adviser to the Remuneration
Committee on an ongoing basis and provides reports and advice as required. Towers Perrin act as Trustee of the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan.
The Group Company Secretary, Mr Martin Palmer, acts as Secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
Duties of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the following duties:
  Determine on behalf of the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the Chairman of the Company, the Chief Executive, the executive
directors and such other members of the executive management as it is designated to consider. 
  Ensure that executive directors and senior management are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are rewarded
for their individual contributions to the success of the Company.
  Determine targets for any performance related pay schemes and ask the Board, when appropriate, to seek shareholder approval for any long term 
incentive arrangements. 
  Consider and determine the terms, scope, implementation and performance criteria of all share based remuneration schemes.
  Ensure that contractual terms on termination and any payments made avoid rewarding poor performance and approve any severance payments. 
  Determine the total individual remuneration package of the Chairman, Chief Executive, each executive director and other designated senior executives,
including, where appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments and share options.
  Determine the policy for and scope of service agreements for executive directors and pensions arrangements, termination payments and compensation
commitments.
  Consider and determine the terms, scope, implementation and performance conditions of the annual bonus scheme and approve annual bonuses.
  In determining remuneration packages and arrangements, give due regard to the requirements and recommendations of the Combined Code as well as the
UK Listing Authority's Listing Rules and associated guidance.
  Review competitor companies but ensure that automatic increases are not implemented.
  Oversee any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Company.
  Ensure that the provisions regarding disclosure of remuneration, including pensions, as set out in the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, are
fulfilled and produce an annual report of the Committee's remuneration policy to be included in the Company's Annual Report and Accounts.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on the Group's website www.bovishomesgroup.plc.uk and on request to the Group
Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee determines the Company's policy for the remuneration of executive directors, having regard to the Directors' Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002 (Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985) and the Combined Code and its provisions on directors' remuneration (Schedules A and B).
Report on directors' remuneration
Bovis Homes Group PLC      29 The Remuneration Committee sets and implements the remuneration policy for the Chairman, executive directors and designated senior management. 
The Remuneration Committee determines the need for independent professional advice where appropriate and has regard to information on compensation
and salary levels in companies in the housebuilding sector and in other companies of comparable size, for executives with similar skills, qualifications 
and experience. The objectives of the remuneration policy are to:
  ensure that the individual rewards and incentives fairly relate to the performance of the individual, the Company and the interests of shareholders;
  maintain a remuneration package which enables the Company to attract, retain, and motivate executives of the appropriate calibre and experience to
further the success of the Company and maximise long term shareholder value; and
  take into account pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.
The remuneration policy was reviewed by the Remuneration Committee during 2006.
Remuneration package
The remuneration package of the executive directors consists of basic salary, performance bonus, health insurance, membership of the Bovis Homes Regulated
Independent Car Scheme for Employees (BRICS), pension, death in service insurance, and participation in the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan.
In prior years, participation in the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme and Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan has also formed part
of the executive directors' remuneration package. The Group suspended use of the Executive Share Option Scheme during 2004. During 2004, the Group also
suspended use of the share incentive plan in respect of the awarding of free shares in the Company.
The Remuneration Committee aims to balance appropriately those elements of an executive director's remuneration which are subject to explicit performance
conditions, accepting that all remuneration is linked with ongoing appraisal of individual performance. By virtue of the various elements of directors'
remuneration subject to performance conditions, a significant part is variable and is not guaranteed. For remuneration paid during 2006 the fixed and variable
elements of the remuneration package of each director is shown, by director, in the two charts immediately below and to the left:
This actual out-turn, in terms of fixed and variable remuneration elements, is as compared to a potential remuneration package, dependant on performance,
reflecting one-third fixed elements and two-thirds variable elements. The chart above to the right shows this graphically.
Salary
Executive director salaries are reviewed annually on 1 July taking into account the total remuneration package at the time of the review.
External directorships
Executive directors may, if so authorised by the Board, accept appointments as non-executive directors of suitable companies and organisations outside 
the Group. Earnings arising from such external directorships are payable directly to the Company.
Performance bonus
Executive directors are able to earn a performance bonus up to a maximum of 100% of basic annual salary prevailing at the date of the Remuneration
Committee meeting to determine bonuses. It is considered that such maximum performance bonus levels create an appropriate level of short term incentive,
and align suitably with the performance bonus entitlements of other companies in the housebuilding sector as well as other publicly listed companies of a
similar size to the Company.
The bonuses payable to executive directors are determined by the Remuneration Committee by reference to challenging performance criteria including
exceeding the previous year's profit before taxation by a specified percentage and the achievement of other strategic targets.
The bonuses of the executive directors are paid from a bonus pool which is generated from increases in profits over the previous year. All office based
employees share in this bonus pool. The rules governing the generation of the bonus pool remain consistent with prior years. Site employees are incentivised
through direct site bonus schemes based on measurable site performance.
The bonus pool remains at zero until profits before taxation and bonus charge increase over the prior year by 2% above the increase in the Retail Price Index
( RPI'). Thereafter, for every 1% increase in profits before taxation and bonus charge over the prior year, a value equal to 0.5% of the Group's profit before
taxation and bonus charge is allocated to the bonus pool. This applies until the increase in profits before taxation and bonus charge reaches 12% over the
increase in RPI at which point the total value allocated to the bonus pool is capped. At this maximum value the bonus pool will equal 5% of the Group's profit
before taxation and bonus charge. Bonus payments in aggregate are restricted to a maximum equal to the value allocated to the bonus pool.
The bonus pool is applied in settling individual employee bonuses subject to individual performance, corporate performance and set bonus caps. Any surplus
bonus pool remaining after settling employee bonuses reverts to the Group and is included in the profits for that financial year.

/3 Executive directors have a bonus cap equal to 100% of basic salary. In addition to the requirement for the bonus pool to have sufficient value to pay employee
bonuses, the Remuneration Committee has established challenging performance criteria for executive directors to determine bonus levels. For bonuses equal
to 100% of basic salary to be considered for payment, specific financial criteria have to be met, including:
  achievement of an increase in Group profits before taxation and bonus of 12% over and above the increase in RPI; and
  achievement of return on capital employed in excess of 20% for the year; and
  achievement of the Group's budgeted profit before taxation for the year.
Performance bonus payments
No bonuses were paid to executive directors in 2006 in respect of the 2005 financial year after considering the achievement or otherwise of the performance
criteria set for the financial year 2005. The actual performance compared to these specific financial performance criteria can be summarised:
Criteria Performance criteria Actual performance
Growth in Group profits before taxation and bonus +14.4% (12%+RPI) -17.7%
Return on capital employed 20% 20%
Following the consideration of performance criteria set for the financial year 2006 the Remuneration Committee has resolved to award bonuses to the
executive directors serving during 2006, to be paid in 2007. The amounts are as set out in the Directors emoluments table on page 34.
Pension
All the executive directors who served during 2006 were senior executive members of the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme. This is a contributory funded, defined
benefit scheme approved by HMRC. Pensionable earnings were equal to basic pay prior to 6 April 2006. From 6 April 2006, increases in pensionable earnings
are restricted each year to the lesser of the percentage increase in basic pay and 2.5%. Mr Malcolm Harris is not subject to the earnings cap and Mr David
Ritchie is subject to the statutory earnings cap for service until 5 April 2006. After this, and following the introduction of the lifetime allowance pension rules
on 6 April 2006, Mr David Ritchie is not subject to an earnings cap for service from 6 April 2006. Normal retirement age for senior executive members under
the scheme is 60, and the accrual rate is 1/45th of final pensionable earnings for each year of service as a senior executive.
Share schemes
The Company employs a standard set of performance conditions for all executive directors in respect of the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option
Scheme and the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan. These performance conditions are described under specific headings in this report. Granting of
share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The performance conditions are designed
to challenge and motivate executive directors to improve profitability and enhance shareholder return. The conditions are designed to require strong collective
and individual performance from the executive directors before options and awards vest, whilst at the same time offering a credible opportunity for success.
For share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan to vest an independent view provided by the Company's auditors, as independent experts,
is required certifying achievement of the relevant performance conditions. This independent view is evidenced by the completion of formal certificates signed
by the auditors. The performance conditions attaching to share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are selected intentionally to be derived
from readily available information which is straightforward and transparent. This ensures that the auditors can make objective assessments of achievement
against the performance conditions.
Although there exist outstanding share options granted to executive directors and senior management which remain unexercised at the date of this report,
the Remuneration Committee resolved, effective of 5 May 2004, to suspend the grant of future awards of share options. The rules of the Bovis Homes Group
PLC Executive Share Option Scheme relating to vesting and exercising outstanding share options remain unaltered.
The Board has proposed that a new employee share option plan be introduced as an incentivisation mechanism for middle management. Executive directors
of the Company will not participate and shareholder approval to the option plan is being sought at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme
The Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme was established in 1997. The Remuneration Committee suspended the issuing of new share options
on 5 May 2004. It is an HMRC approved scheme and has historically granted share options on an approved basis within HMRC limits and on an unapproved
basis outside HMRC limits. The scheme is operated by the Remuneration Committee with participants selected at the sole discretion of the Remuneration
Committee.
For outstanding share options, the performance criteria require that any share option held under the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme
can only normally be exercised if the auditors have certified that the cumulative increase in annualised earnings per share exceeds the percentage increase in
RPI by at least 4% per annum (2% per annum for share options granted before 2001) over three consecutive years.
The exercise price of a share option has been determined by the Board at the date of grant and has not been less than the higher of the market value and
nominal value of an ordinary share in the Company at the date of grant.
Assuming the performance criteria are satisfied, share options may, under normal circumstances, be exercised between the third and tenth anniversary from
the date of grant.
Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan
A Long Term Incentive Plan for executive directors and senior executives was approved by shareholders at the 2000 Annual General Meeting and established
on 10 May 2000. An amendment to the rules of the Long Term Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders at the 2004 Annual General Meeting. Under the
amended rules of the scheme at the date of this report a participant may receive in respect of any year a maximum award of shares with a market value, when
the award was made, not exceeding 100% of basic salary. Each award is made subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria and awards may
only be exercised at the end of three years. There is no cost to the participants in the scheme to exercise the awards.
Report on directors' remuneration continued
Bovis Homes Group PLC      31 The extent to which the awards may be exercised is determined by two measures of performance; total shareholder return ( TSR') and earnings per share ( EPS')
growth, each measured over a three year performance period and each relating to half of the shares awarded.
The TSR measure requires the comparison of the growth in the Company's TSR over a three year period to that of a group of comparator companies in the
housebuilding industry specified by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the performance period. TSR is the aggregate of share price growth and
dividends paid during the three year period (assuming that such dividends are reinvested in ordinary shares). The Company's ranking amongst the comparator
companies will determine the percentage of the shares under the award which will vest, as follows:
TSR ranking % of total award which can be realised
1st position 50% of the shares in the award
2nd position 45% of the shares in the award
3rd position 37.5% of the shares in the award
4th position 30% of the shares in the award
5th position 20% of the shares in the award
6th position 15% of the shares in the award
The group of comparator companies is as follows:
Comparator companies
Barratt Developments PLC Bellway p.l.c. The Berkeley Group plc Crest Nicholson PLC
Wilson Bowden plc Persimmon plc Redrow Group plc Taylor Woodrow plc
George Wimpey PLC
The EPS growth measure is based on the extent to which the Company's average annual EPS growth over the three year performance period falls between
minimum and maximum EPS growth targets set by the Remuneration Committee as follows:
EPS growth % of total award which can be realised
Maximum EPS growth 50% of the shares in the award
Minimum EPS growth 20% of the shares in the award
For the current outstanding awards, the minimum and maximum EPS growth targets are 4% and 10% above RPI respectively. Where EPS growth falls between
the minimum and maximum EPS growth targets, the number of shares which can be realised will be determined on a straight line sliding scale. Where EPS
growth falls below 4% above RPI, none of the shares in the award judged by reference to EPS growth can be realised.
The shares required to satisfy the awards have been purchased by the Bovis Homes Group Employee Trust. The grant price of the awards is set as the market
value of the shares at the date the shares are purchased by the Trustee. The market value of the shares attributable to each director will be included in
remuneration in the year in which the awards are exercised. An award may only be exercised within six months of the realisation date, the realisation date
being the date of notification from the Trustee of the Bovis Homes Group Employee Trust that the award is realisable in whole or in part.
Performance graph
As required by the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the following performance graph compares, over the last five financial years, the Total
Shareholder Return of an ordinary share held in Bovis Homes Group PLC against the Total Shareholder Return of the FTSE mid-250 index. In previous years,
this graph was prepared against the FTSE All Share Construction and Buildings Material Index, but this index has been discontinued. As Bovis Homes Group
PLC is a constituent of the FTSE mid-250 index, together with all but one of the listed UK housebuilders contained in the comparator group selected by the
Remuneration Committee for benchmarking performance, the Remuneration Committee considers this to be a representative broad market index against
which to assess the performance of the Group, having regard to the size and nature of the companies in this index.

300 Service agreements and terms of appointment
In respect of each of the executive directors, the service agreements are rolling twelve month contracts with a twelve month notice period due from either
employer or employee after one year's service. Before one year's service is completed the notice period is six months from either party.
In addition to their salaries, the executive directors are entitled to participate in the Bovis Homes' employee share schemes including the Long Term Incentive
Plan, and to be considered for a performance bonus, dependent on the achievement of targets set down annually by the Remuneration Committee. They are
also entitled to membership of the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme as a senior executive where service began on or before 2001, membership of the defined
contribution pension scheme where service began after 2001 and between 24 and 27 working days holiday per annum determined by length of service. 
The directors hold membership of the Bovis Homes Regulated Independent Car Scheme for Employees (BRICS). There are no specific provisions for
compensation on early termination.
The non-executive directors have entered into service agreements for their services which are established for periods up to three years duration based upon
the frequency of re-election to the Board with notice periods up to twelve months. The service agreements for the non-executive directors are available for
inspection on request to the Group Company Secretary. The fees for their services were last reviewed as follows:

Changes in the number of ordinary shares held arose from the exercise of share options, and the investment during the year in partnership shares through the
HMRC approved Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan. Other changes in the number of shares held arose through the electing for shares in place of
dividends as part of the Company's scrip dividend offer and a share purchase by Mr Colin Holmes. There were no changes in the holdings of ordinary shares
of any of the directors between 31 December 2006 and 9 March 2007, other than the normal monthly investment in partnership shares through the Bovis
Homes Group Share Incentive Plan. Mr Neil Cooper is beneficially interested in nil shares.
The directors' interests in share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are detailed on pages 35 to 36. There were no changes in the holdings
of share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan between 31 December 2006 and 9 March 2007.
Share ownership guidelines
There exist guidelines for executive directors in respect of share ownership of Bovis Homes' shares. The Board expects executive directors benefiting from the
exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards or exercise of share options to retain at least 50% of the net value derived from the exercise, after settling all
costs and income tax due, as shares. This guideline is expected to be applied until such time as the executive director holds shares with a market value equal
to current basic annual salary.

Mr Malcolm Harris' increase was assessed against equivalent salaries of Chief Executives working for other housebuilders and publicly listed companies of a
similar size. 
The increase in respect of Mr David Ritchie's basic salary was assessed against equivalent salaries of Finance Directors working for other publicly listed 
UK housebuilders and companies of comparable size. On taking up the position of Group Managing Director on 2 January 2007, Mr David Ritchie received a
further increase taking his salary to  300,000. This new salary was assessed against the equivalent salary for similar roles in other publicly listed housebuilders
and companies of comparable size.
In addition to his basic salary, Mr David Ritchie received payments equivalent to the employer's pension contributions above the statutory earnings cap. 
During 2006,  7,942 was paid in this respect. These payments ceased on 5 April 2006.
During 2006, the company reviewed the level of fees paid to its non-executive directors, supported by an independent benchmarking exercise assessing the
fees payable to non-executive directors in similar companies, comparable both in terms of sector, and in terms of size.
As a result, the fees payable to Mr Tim Melville-Ross, the non-executive chairman, have been increased from  80,000 to  95,000, and the fees payable to 
Mr Mark Nicholls, the senior independent director and chairman of the Audit Committee, have been increased from  33,000 to  45,000. The fees payable to
Mrs Lesley MacDonagh have been increased from  27,000 to  35,000, and the fees payable to Mr John Warren have been increased from  27,000 to  40,000,
partly as a a result of the benchmarking exercise, and partly following his appointment as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
Directors' emoluments are in the form of cash with the exception of the provision of health insurance and death in service insurance provided in excess of
the earnings cap until 5 April 2006, where applicable.
The gains for directors on the exercise of share options are shown on page 36.

Report on directors' remuneration continued
36 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.bovishomesgroup.plc.uk The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and accounts and the Group and Parent Company financial statements, in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Parent Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent
Company financial statements on the same basis.
The Group and Parent Company financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position of the Group
and the Parent Company and the performance for that period; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial statements that references in
the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
  make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
  for the Group and Parent Company financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent Company will continue 
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Parent
Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a directors' report, report on directors' remuneration and report on
corporate governance that comply with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company's website. Legislation in
the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
