Report on directors' remuneration
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and meets 
the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the Combined Code. A resolution will be put to shareholders at the 
Company's Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2011 inviting them to consider and approve this report. The auditors are required to report to the Company's 
members on that part of this remuneration report which is subject to audit and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. This report is therefore presented in two sections: unaudited information and audited information.
Section 1: Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is made up solely of non-executive directors with no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in the matters to  
be decided. Those non-executive directors serving on the Remuneration Committee during 2010 were Colin Holmes as Chairman, John Warren, Alastair Lyons 
and, until 6 May 2010, Lesley MacDonagh. Meetings of the Remuneration Committee are held as and when appropriate and at least three times per annum. 
During 2010, the Remuneration Committee met on six occasions and all members, then current, attended each meeting with the exception of John Warren, 
Alastair Lyons and Lesley MacDonagh who each missed one meeting by prior arrangement.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, from time to time, calls upon Malcolm Harris (Chairman) and also David Ritchie (Chief Executive) to assist in discussions and 
deliberations of the Remuneration Committee on remuneration matters not pertaining to their own remuneration or terms and conditions of employment. 
The Remuneration Committee has, on occasion, appointed the services of external advisers to advise on remuneration. Since August 2009 Deloitte LLP  
has been ongoing adviser to the Committee and attends Committee meetings as required. Deloitte LLP has also provided VAT advice to the Company  
during 2010. ACS HR Solutions Share Plan Services (formerly ExcellerateHRO Share Plan Services) act as Trustee of the Bovis Homes Group Long Term  
Incentive Plan. The Group Company Secretary, Martin Palmer, acts as Secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
Duties of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the following duties:
 	 Determine on behalf of the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the Chairman of the Company, the Chief Executive, the 
executive directors and circa thirty five members of senior management. 
 	 Within that framework/policy, determine the total individual remuneration package of the Chairman, Chief Executive, each executive director and 
other designated senior executives, including, where appropriate, bonuses and share awards, having regard to the pay and conditions of employees 
throughout the Company.
 	 Ensure that executive directors and senior management are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are 
rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Company.
 	 Determine targets for any performance related pay schemes and ask the Board, when appropriate, to seek shareholder approval for any long term 
incentive arrangements.
 	 Consider and determine the terms, scope, implementation and performance criteria of all share based remuneration schemes.
 	 Ensure that contractual terms on termination and any payments made avoid rewarding poor performance and approve any severance payments.
 	 Determine the policy for and scope of service agreements for executive directors and pensions arrangements, termination payments and compensation 
commitments.
 	 Consider and determine the terms, scope, implementation and performance conditions of the annual bonus scheme and approve annual bonuses.
 	 In determining remuneration packages and arrangements, give due regard to the requirements and recommendations of the Combined Code as well 
as the UK Listing Authority's Listing Rules and associated guidance.
 	 Review competitor companies and maintain awareness of wider market movements and implement remuneration packages appropriate to the Company.
 	 Oversee any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Company.
 	 Ensure that the provisions regarding disclosure of remuneration, including pensions, as set out in the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 are fulfilled and produce an annual report of the Committee's remuneration policy to be included in the 
Company's Annual Report and Accounts.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on the Group's website www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk and on request to the Group 
Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee determines the Company's policy for the remuneration of executive directors, having regard to the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (Regulation 11 and Schedule 8) and the Combined Code and its provisions on directors' 
remuneration, including Schedule A. The Remuneration Committee sets and implements remuneration policy for the Chairman, executive directors and 
designated senior management. 
The Remuneration Committee determines the need for independent professional advice where appropriate and has regard to information on compensation 
and salary levels in companies in the housebuilding sector and in other companies of comparable size and complexity. The objectives of the remuneration 
policy are to:
 	 ensure that the individual rewards and incentives fairly relate to the performance of the individual, the Company and the interests of shareholders;
 	 maintain a remuneration package which enables the Company to attract, retain, and motivate executives of the appropriate calibre and experience to 
further the success of the Company and maximise long term shareholder value; and
 	 take into account pay and employment conditions throughout the Company.
The remuneration policy was reviewed by the Remuneration Committee during 2010. Bovis Homes Group PLC      43

Remuneration package
The remuneration package of the executive directors consists of basic salary, performance bonus, health insurance, membership of the Bovis Homes 
Regulated Independent Car Scheme for Employees (BRICS), pension, death in service assurance, and participation in employee share schemes and the 
Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan.
The Remuneration Committee aims to balance appropriately fixed remuneration with those elements of an executive director's remuneration which are 
subject to explicit performance conditions, accepting that all remuneration is linked with ongoing appraisal of individual performance. By virtue of the 
various elements of directors' remuneration being subject to performance conditions, a significant part is variable and is not guaranteed. The potential 
remuneration package is structured so that one-third is fixed and two-thirds is variable. Whilst the Remuneration Committee aims to achieve this balance, 
it recognises that the payout in any year will vary from this. The chart below to the left shows this graphically.

Gains on 2007 LTIP
(variable)
For remuneration earned during 2010 the fixed element, being salary, and variable elements, which includes bonus and gains on the exercise of LTIP 
awards granted in 2007, are shown, by director, in the charts immediately above and to the right. As Jonathan Hill commenced with the Company on 
23 August 2010 he had no entitlement to exercise awards under the LTIP during 2010. Neil Cooper left the Company on 6 May 2010 and received no 
additional compensation on departure.
Salary
Executive director salaries are reviewed annually to take effect from 1 January, taking into account the total remuneration package at the time of the review 
and having regard to the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Company. At the end of 2010, the Remuneration Committee undertook a review 
of David Ritchie's salary, which had not been increased since July 2008, having regard to the significant contribution made to the Group's performance 
since his appointment in July 2008. This process was supported by an external benchmarked review, to gain an understanding of remuneration levels in 
companies of similar size and complexity, and independent advice. As a result the Committee decided to increase his salary by 3.75% to  415,000 from 
1 January 2011. The salary of Jonathan Hill was set at  240,000 on appointment on 23 August 2010 and will next be reviewed on 1 January 2012.
Annual performance bonus
Following a consultation with major shareholders, the Remuneration Committee established a new annual bonus scheme commencing for the  
2010 financial year. Under this scheme the executive directors have a bonus cap equal to 100% of basic annual salary prevailing at the date of the 
Remuneration Committee meeting to determine bonus earned. The plan was designed as a long term arrangement with flexibility to adapt to a range of 
market conditions. A mix of performance measures are used, with the proportion applying to each measure and the associated targets being determined 
by the Remuneration Committee at the start of each year. The approach is designed to result in a balanced remuneration package, aligned with business 
strategy. The maximum bonus caps provide an appropriate level of short term incentive which is aligned with performance bonus arrangements of other 
house building companies and listed companies of similar size and complexity.
Any bonus will normally be paid in cash. However, before paying cash bonuses the Remuneration Committee reviews the proposed position regarding 
dividends. If no dividend is proposed, the Remuneration Committee may choose to exercise its discretion to pay all, or part, of the bonus in ordinary shares, 
with the right to receive the shares normally deferred for two years.
The overall principles applying to the mix of performance measures are:
 	 at least 70% of the bonus will be based on financial measures, with the balance being based on non-financial measures;
 	 the financial criteria are likely to include one or more of profit before tax, return on capital employed and cash flow
 	 the non-financial measures are likely to include one or both of health and safety and customer service
The assessment of bonus achievement in respect of the 2010 financial year considered delivery against performance measures set by the Remuneration 
Committee comprising 80% financial performance measures (profit before tax, cash flow and management of land acquisition) and 20% non-financial 
performance measures (health and safety and customer service). The targets set for each performance measure contained threshold, on target and stretch 
elements and all stretch targets were achieved. The outcome was approved by the Remuneration Committee and bonuses were awarded to the executive 
directors for the 2010 financial year equal to 100% of current basic annual salary (pro-rated for service), to be paid in 2011. The level of bonus awarded to 
the executive directors was considered appropriate as a result of the high level of performance during a challenging year, which saw a significant increase 
in pre tax profits to  18.5 million and earnings per share to 10.6p, operating margin progression, good progress with land acquisition and a strong cash 
flow performance, providing the basis for a return to dividend in 2011.
In advance of the bonus decision being considered, David Ritchie had requested that  193,000 of any bonus awarded to him be sacrificed in exchange 
for an equivalent employer contribution to a qualifying personal pension arrangement. After careful consideration, this request was agreed by the 
Remuneration Committee and the bonus was subsequently awarded, with the result that David Ritchie will receive  222,000 as a cash bonus before tax 
and a contribution of  193,000 will be made by his employer to the qualifying personal pension arrangement. 44      Bovis Homes Group PLC  www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk
Report on directors' remuneration continued
The Remuneration Committee has spent time ensuring that performance measures and targets for the 2011 financial year are based around the key 
deliverables of the business. The performance measures will be based 90% on financial measures and 10% on non-financial measures. The 2011 targets 
have been set by the Remuneration Committee taking into account appropriate internal and external metrics, including analysts' forecasts for the Company 
and the sector.
All office based employees receive separate consideration for a bonus based on the achievement of bonus performance targets and personal performance 
to be paid from profits generated during the year. Site employees are incentivised through direct site bonus schemes based on measurable site 
performance. Sales staff are incentivised through separate commission arrangements.
Pension
David Ritchie is a senior executive member of the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme. This is a contributory funded, defined benefit scheme approved by HMRC. 
Pensionable earnings were equal to basic pay prior to 6 April 2006. From 6 April 2006, increases in pensionable earnings are restricted each year to  
the lesser of the percentage increase in basic pay and 2.5%. David Ritchie is subject to the statutory earnings cap for service until 5 April 2006  
and, following the introduction of the lifetime allowance pension rules on 6 April 2006, is not subject to an earnings cap for service from 6 April 2006. 
Normal retirement age for senior executive members under the scheme is 60, and the accrual rate is 1/45th of final pensionable earnings for each year of 
service as a senior executive. There are no special early retirement, unreduced pension or early termination provisions for executive directors.
At the end of 2010, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the competitiveness of pension provision and adopted a revised pensions policy which sets 
a contribution rate allowance of 20% of basic annual salary per annum for David Ritchie from April 2011. A sum is deducted from this allowance for 
Company contributions to the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme and the balance will be paid as a non-bonusable and non-pensionable salary supplement.
Neil Cooper was a member of the Bovis Homes Group Personal Pension Plan until 6 May 2010 and Jonathan Hill is a current member. The Plan is a 
contracted-in defined contribution arrangement, to which the Company contributes 7% of basic annual salary per annum. Normal retirement age for 
joiners after 1 October 2006 is age 65. There are no special early retirement or early termination provisions for executive directors.
Share schemes
The Company operates the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan for executive directors and senior management. The granting of awards under 
the Plan is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The performance conditions are designed to challenge and motivate executive directors to 
improve profitability and enhance shareholder return. The conditions are also designed to require strong collective and individual performance from the 
executive directors before options and awards vest, whilst at the same time offering a credible opportunity for success. 
Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan 2010
The current Long Term Incentive Plan for executive directors and senior executives was approved by shareholders at the 2010 Annual General Meeting. 
Under the rules of the plan, in normal circumstances, a participant may receive in respect of any financial year a maximum award of shares with a market 
value, when the award is made, not exceeding 100% of basic salary. Each award is made subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria 
determined by the Remuneration Committee and awards may usually be exercised at the end of three years. There is no cost to the participants in the 
plan to exercise the awards and dividend equivalents will normally be paid on vesting shares.
The extent to which awards granted under the plan in 2011 may be exercised is determined by two measures of performance; total shareholder return 
( TSR') and earnings per share ( EPS'), each measured over a three year performance period and each relating to half of the shares awarded.
The TSR measure requires the comparison of the growth in the Company's TSR over a three year period to that of a group of comparator companies in 
the housebuilding industry specified by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the performance period. TSR is the aggregate of share price growth 
and dividends paid during the three year period (assuming that such dividends are reinvested in ordinary shares).
The TSR measure assesses performance relative to the median over the three year performance period, as derived from the TSR performance of the 
comparator companies. Measuring performance against the median provides a robust approach and one less prone to distortions and is viable for smaller 
comparator groups. Vesting is as follows:
TSR performance % of total award which can be realised
Maximum TSR performance 50% of the shares in the award
Threshold TSR performance 15% of the shares in the award
In setting the TSR performance targets for the 2011 awards, the Remuneration Committee has taken account of historic TSR performance in the 
housebuilders comparator group and wider practice amongst FTSE 350 companies. Threshold TSR performance is set at the median, as for previous awards, 
and maximum TSR performance is set at median plus 10% growth in TSR of the comparator group, deemed to be equivalent to achieving at least upper 
quartile performance based on historic TSR performance. Where TSR performance falls between the threshold and the maximum TSR performance, the 
percentage of shares which can be realised will be calculated on a straight line sliding scale. Where TSR falls below median, none of the shares in the 
award judged by reference to TSR can be realised.
The group of comparator companies is comprised as follows:
Comparator companies
Barratt Developments PLC The Berkeley Group plc Taylor Wimpey plc
Bellway p.l.c. Persimmon plc Redrow Group plc Bovis Homes Group PLC      45
Report on directors' remuneration continued
The EPS measure is based on the extent to which the Company's EPS over the three year performance period falls between minimum and maximum EPS 
targets set by the Remuneration Committee as follows:
EPS % of total award which can be realised
Maximum EPS 50% of the shares in the award
Threshold EPS 15% of the shares in the award
In setting minimum and maximum absolute EPS targets for the 2011 awards, the Remuneration Committee has considered data providing visibility 
over the three year performance period, including internal forecasts and analysts' forecasts. Use of a cumulative three year EPS target, first used for the 
2010 awards, was again considered appropriate, given the ongoing uncertain environment. Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee has set absolute 
minimum and maximum EPS targets of 55p and 80p per share to be measured on a cumulative basis over the three year performance period. Where EPS 
falls between the minimum and maximum EPS targets, the number of shares which can be realised will be determined on a straight line sliding scale. 
Where EPS falls below the minimum, none of the shares in the award judged by reference to EPS can be realised.
2011 awards granted to the executive directors will be over shares with a market value of 100% of basic salary.
Awards were granted under the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan 2000 until March 2010. Awards granted in 2008, 2009 and 2010 may be 
exercised subject to EPS and TSR performance targets being met, each relating to half of the shares awarded.
For 2008 and 2009 awards, threshold TSR performance is set at median growth in the TSR comparator group and maximum TSR performance is set at 
median plus 15% growth in TSR. For 2010 awards, threshold TSR performance is again set at median growth in the TSR comparator group and maximum 
TSR performance is set at median plus 10% growth in TSR. 
The threshold and maximum EPS targets for 2008 awards are 4% and 10% per annum above RPI respectively. The Remuneration Committee then set 
absolute levels of EPS for 2009 awards of 20p and 50p per share as the maximum and threshold EPS targets to be measured in the third year of the 
performance period. For 2010 awards, absolute levels of EPS were again used, with threshold and maximum EPS targets set at 35p and 50p per share, to 
be measured on a cumulative basis over the three year performance period. Threshold EPS vesting realises 20% of the shares in an award for 2008 and 
2009 awards and 15% of the shares in an award for 2010 awards.
Awards granted to executive directors in 2010 were made at 100% of basic salary. 
For the 2008 awards, the threshold EPS target was not met and the Company's TSR performance was between the threshold TSR target and the maximum 
TSR target. Therefore, total vesting for the 2008 awards was 31.05%.
The shares required to satisfy the awards have been purchased by the Bovis Homes Group Employee Trust. The grant price of the awards is set as the 
market value of the shares at the date of grant. The market value of the shares attributable to each director will be included in remuneration in the year 
in which the awards are exercised. An award may only be exercised within six months of the realisation date under the Long Term Incentive Plan 2000, 
the realisation date being the date of notification from the Trustee of the Bovis Homes Group Employee Trust that the award is realisable in whole or  
in part. Awards may be exercised up until the tenth anniversary of the date of grant under the Long Term Incentive Plan 2010.
Bovis Homes Group PLC 2009 Bonus Replacement Share Plan
The Bovis Homes Group PLC Bonus Replacement Share Plan was approved at the 2009 Annual General Meeting and is designed to encourage and 
reward participants for delivering business recovery that results in the creation of shareholder value. The Plan was operated in 2009 only as an alternative 
to entitlement for consideration for annual cash bonus. Awards were granted on 7 May 2009 and will be capable of exercise, should the performance 
condition be met, for a period of six months following 7 May 2012.
The performance condition is linked to an average share price target to be measured at the end of the performance period. The average market value of 
a share achieved over the three months immediately preceding the end of the performance period will determine the number of shares which will vest. 
Vesting will be calculated in accordance with the following table and is subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, as mentioned above:
Average share price achieved Percentage of shares in award that vest
 7.00 100%
 6.00 50%
 5.50 25%
Less than  5.50 nil
The number of shares that will vest will be calculated on a straight-line basis for average share prices achieved between  5.50 and  7.00. Operated in 
2009 only, the Plan terminated on the conclusion of the 2010 Annual General Meeting, with outstanding awards remaining in existence. 46      Bovis Homes Group PLC  www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk

Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme
The Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme was established in 1997 and expired in 2007, with the granting of options being suspended 
in 2004. Options granted to one executive director are still current. The performance criteria require that any share option held under the Scheme can only 
normally be exercised if the auditors have certified that the cumulative increase in annualised earnings per share exceeds the percentage increase in RPI 
by at least 4% per annum over three consecutive years. Assuming the performance criteria are satisfied, share options may, under normal circumstances, 
be exercised between the third and tenth anniversary from the date of grant.
External directorships
Executive directors may, if so authorised by the Board, accept appointments as non-executive directors of suitable companies and organisations outside 
the Group. Neither of the executive directors currently has any such appointments.

Service agreements and terms of appointment
In respect of each of the executive directors, the service agreements are rolling twelve month contracts with a twelve month notice period due from either 
employer or employee.
In addition to their salaries, the executive directors are eligible to participate in the Bovis Homes' employee share schemes and the Long Term Incentive Plan, 
and to be considered for an annual performance bonus, dependent on the achievement of targets set down annually by the Remuneration Committee. 
They are also entitled to membership of the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme as a senior executive where service began on or before 2001, membership of 
the defined contribution pension plan where service began after 2001 and between 24 and 27 working days holiday per annum determined by length 
of service. The directors hold membership of the Bovis Homes Regulated Independent Car Scheme for Employees (BRICS). There are no specific provisions 
for compensation on early termination.
The non-executive directors have entered into service agreements for their services which are established for periods up to three years duration, based 
upon re-election requirements under the Articles of Association, with notice periods up to twelve months. The service agreements for the non-executive 
directors are available for inspection on request to the Group Company Secretary. The fees for their services have been reviewed as follows:

Changes in the number of ordinary shares held arose from the exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards, and investment during the year in partnership 
shares through the HMRC approved Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan. Other changes in the number of shares held resulted from share purchases 
by Alastair Lyons and Colin Holmes. There were no changes in the holdings of ordinary shares of any of the directors between 31 December 2010 and  
11 March 2011, other than the normal monthly investment in partnership shares through the Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan.
The directors' interests in share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are detailed on pages 49 to 50. There were no changes in the 
holdings of share options and awards under the 2009 Bonus Replacement Share Plan and the Long Term Incentive Plan between 31 December 2010 
and 11 March 2011. LTIP awards granted to Malcolm Harris whilst an executive director continue in force until the third anniversary of the award date 
and, should either of the two measures of performance be met, the number of shares which can be realised will be reduced according to the proportion 
of the three year performance period following cessation of employment, measured in complete months, relative to the three year performance period.
Share ownership guidelines
There exist guidelines for executive directors in respect of share ownership of Bovis Homes' shares. The Board expects executive directors benefiting from 
the exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards or exercise of share options to retain at least 50% of the net value derived from the exercise, after settling 
all costs and income tax due, as shares. This guideline is expected to be applied until such time as the executive director holds shares with a market value 
equal to current basic annual salary. 48      Bovis Homes Group PLC  www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk

in exchange for an equivalent employer contribution to a qualifying personal pension arrangement. For clarity, the pre-sacrifice amount has been shown in the table above.
The Company's annual salary review date is 1 January each year. 2010 was a year of continued pay restraint within the Group. An allowance of 2% of 
salary roll was provided for general staff, which was applied on a merit basis effective from 1 January 2011. Against this background, the Remuneration 
Committee undertook a review of David Ritchie's salary, which had not been increased since July 2008, having regard to the significant contribution made 
to the Group's performance since his appointment in July 2008. As a result the Committee decided to increase his salary by 3.75% to  415,000 from  
1 January 2011. The salary of Jonathan Hill was set at  240,000 on appointment on 23 August 2010 and will next be reviewed on 1 January 2012.

During the year, the Remuneration Committee reviewed fees paid to the Chairman, supported by independent advice. Taking account of the strong 
leadership provided to the Board and the value of the Chairman's industry and sector knowledge, the fee was increased by 4% to  130,000 from  
1 January 2011. Separately, the Board reviewed fees paid to the non-executive directors, again supported by appropriate independent advice. As a result, 
the fee for the Deputy Chairman and the non-executive director base fee were not increased, but the fees for the Chairman of the Audit Committee and 
the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee were increased to take account of increased workload and responsibility. John Warren's fee has therefore 
increased from  47,000 to  48,000 and Colin Holmes' fee has increased from  45,000 to  48,000 both from 1 January 2011. The level of fees paid to 
the Chairman and the non-executive directors were last reviewed in 2008.  Bovis Homes Group PLC      49

Statement of directors' responsibilities in  
respect of the annual report and the financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the Group and Parent Company financial statements, in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Parent Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the 
Parent Company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law, the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
 	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 	 make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
 	 for the Group and Parent Company financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
 	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent Company will continue 
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company's transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and 
to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a directors' report, report on directors' remuneration and report on 
corporate governance that comply with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. Legislation 
in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
a)  the Group and Parent Company financial statements in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, IFRIC 
interpretation and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Company and of the Group taken as a whole; and
b)  the management report contained in this report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the Group taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.
For and on behalf of the Board
