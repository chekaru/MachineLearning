 Overview
As described by the Chairman and Chief Executive in their 
statements, 2011 has been a very encouraging year for Bovis 
Homes, during which the Company has delivered strong profit 
growth and positioned itself excellently for improved returns 
in 2012 and beyond. This has been achieved through the 
continued acquisition of high quality consented and strategic 
land, combined with an increased level of legal completions at a 
higher average sales price and increased profit margins.
In 2010, after consulting with shareholders and receiving  
strong support, we introduced the new annual bonus scheme 
and the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan 2010.  
The Committee is confident that they continue to work well and 
motivate management to deliver stretching performance targets. 
However, as explained below, going forward we believe that 
Return on Capital Employed (ROCE ) measures should be built 
into these arrangements, to reinforce our stated objective of 
improving ROCE. 
Remuneration policy
The principal aim of our remuneration policy is to align  
executive remuneration with the interests of our shareholders  
in order to drive the creation of long term shareholder value.  
The Committee is committed to setting remuneration at a level 
which is deemed fair, and which rewards performance.
Whilst recognising its primary duty to shareholders and the 
Company the Committee is mindful of the high level of public 
and political scrutiny around executive remuneration.  
We are committed to a remuneration structure which does 
not guarantee reward through excessive levels of fixed pay or 
through inappropriate incentives, but one that rewards genuine, 
sustainable performance in line with shareholder interests.
Remuneration in 2011
The annual bonus out-turn for 2011 of 82.4% of maximum 
represents strong performance against financial and operational 
targets. Profit before tax increased significantly by 74%, whilst 
there was additionally a very strong focus on cash flow, robust 
land management and high customer satisfaction.
The Long Term Incentive Plan awards granted in 2009 will lapse in 
full, as neither the EPS condition nor the TSR condition were met.
Changes in remuneration policy for 2012
The Committee are committed to taking shareholder views into 
account when determining remuneration arrangements both for 
the coming year and for the longer term. A key theme arising from 
recent shareholder dialogue has been the importance of having 
clear plans within the business focused on improving ROCE.  
The Committee believes this should be recognised in both the 
annual and long-term incentive plans. Therefore the Committee 
has decided to introduce Return on Invested Capital (ROIC ) as 
one of the measures into the annual bonus plan and ROCE as 
one of the measures in the Long Term Incentive Plan.
Base salary levels for the Chief Executive and the Finance 
Director, have been increased for 2012, as have contributions 
to the Finance Director's pension. As further described in the 
report, the Committee strongly believes that these are fully 
justified taking into account the strength of their contribution, as 
well as the success of the Company during the year. However, 
other than the change to the performance measures referred to 
above there have been no other major changes, and maximum 
incentive opportunities for both the annual bonus and the Long 
Term Incentive Plan remain unchanged.
I would like to express my gratitude to my colleagues on the 
Committee for their support and valuable input during the year. 
The Committee appreciates the dialogue and feedback from 
shareholders and hopes to receive your support at the AGM on 
16 May 2012.
Colin	Holmes
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce the 2011 Directors' Remuneration 
Report, prepared by the Remuneration Committee and approved 
by the Board. The format of the report has changed quite 
significantly from previous years and I am hopeful that readers 
will appreciate its clarity. In designing the format we have 
fully considered the Government's consultation on the future 
of narrative reporting and we will continue to monitor these 
developments carefully.

Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. The report 
also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of 
the Financial Services Authority, and describes how the Board 
has complied with the principles and provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code published in June 2010  
( the Code') relating to remuneration matters. The report 
will be presented at the AGM on 16 May 2012 for advisory 
approval and shareholders will be able to ask questions on  
the report at the AGM.
The report is divided into two parts. 
   The first part sets out our remuneration policy and the 
governance structures which underpin this policy. This part  
is not required to be audited. 
   The second part contains the remuneration tables that 
have been audited in accordance with the relevant  
statutory requirements. 
Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee 
The following table details the members of the Remuneration 
Committee, their date of appointment, their role, and the 
number of meetings the Committee had during the year and 
their respective attendance: 
 
Name
 
Date of appointment

Colin Holmes 01/12/2006 Chairman 6/6
Alastair Lyons 01/10/2008 Member 6/6
John Warren 01/03/2006 Member 6/6
All members of the Committee are independent and have 
no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in 
the matters to be decided, and no day-to-day involvement in 
running the business.
The Committee determines the remuneration packages 
(including incentive plans and their performance criteria) and 
any changes to service contracts of the Chairman, executive 
directors and other designated senior executives including the 
Company Secretary. 
The Board determines the fees and overall remuneration of  
the non-executive directors without the non-executive 
directors' participation.
No director or senior executive is involved in any decisions as  
to his or her own remuneration. 
The Committee's terms of reference are available on 
the Company's website (www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk/
information-on/corporate-governance).
Advisers to the Committee
During the year, the Committee took advice from Deloitte 
LLP, its appointed advisers since August 2009. Deloitte provide 
independent advice to the Committee on all aspects of 
executive remuneration. Deloitte attend Remuneration 
Committee meetings when invited by the Chairman of the 
Committee. Deloitte has also provided VAT advice to the 
Company during 2011. Deloitte are a founder member of 
the Remuneration Consultants Group and have signed the 
voluntary Code of Practice for remuneration consultants. 
The Committee always starts its meetings without executive 
management present. Thereafter the Committee may and 
does call upon Malcolm Harris (Chairman) and David Ritchie 
(Chief Executive) to assist in its discussions and deliberations 
on matters not pertaining to their own remuneration, service 
agreement or terms and conditions of employment. They were 
invited to attend all Committee meetings during the year.  
The Committee is also supported by Martin Palmer  
(Company Secretary), who acts as secretary to the Committee. 
No person was present during any part of a meeting when 
their own remuneration was being discussed. 
Principles of the remuneration policy
The Committee's remuneration policy is designed to provide 
a market competitive, performance-related package which 
supports and facilitates the delivery of the Company's strategy 
and the creation of long-term shareholder value. The key 
principles of the remuneration policy are:
   to ensure that individual rewards and incentives fairly reflect 
the performance of the individual, the Company and the 
interests of shareholders;
   to provide a market competitive reward to attract, retain 
and incentivise executives of the calibre needed to deliver  
on the Company's strategy and to create long-term 
shareholder value;  Bovis	Homes	Group	PLC		 |		41
   the total package should include a significant variable element 
which is aligned to the performance of the Company, both in the 
short term and over the longer-term;
   the package should be linked to the Company's strategic goals, 
and how success against these goals is measured;
   executives should build up shareholdings in the Company, 
through the vesting of long term incentive awards;
   the policy should uphold the key principles of best practice on 
executive remuneration; and
   remuneration should be designed to promote the long-term 
success of the Company and should not reward excessive risk 
taking and should not reward failure.
In setting the remuneration arrangements for the executives 
and senior management, the Committee considers the pay and 
conditions of the employees throughout the Group.
Competitive positioning
When considering how to position the remuneration packages for 
the executive directors, the Committee considers market data from 
UK listed companies of a similar size and complexity, as well as 
specific practice in the housebuilding sector. This data is provided 
by Deloitte, as independent advisers to the Committee. 
The Committee positions salaries and incentive opportunities 
at what would be considered a market competitive level, whilst 
not seeking to match the median . As explained above the 
aim is that the arrangements should motivate management to 
deliver stretching performance in the interests of shareholders. 
Outperformance for shareholders should be recognised with 
superior reward.

key interest of shareholders, being the return achieved on their 
invested capital.
   The Committee believe that it is important that the return on

such a measure.

2012 are as follows:

2012 base salary
% increase  
from 2011
David Ritchie CEO  430,000 3.6%
Jonathan Hill GFD  260,000 8.3%
 
In settling executive director salaries the Committee is always 
mindful of the need to avoid excessive and unjustified reward. 
Changes are only approved if full justification exists.
The GFD, Jonathan Hill, joined the Company on 23 August 2010 
on a salary reflective of the fact that he was new in the role.  
The Board has been pleased with the strong contribution he has 
made to the Group. His new salary reflects this and is viewed as 
being in line with a market competitive position.
The increase for the CEO, David Ritchie, represents a reflection 
of his outstanding leadership and enormous contribution to the 
Group through a challenging period. The increased salary remains 
at a level which is in line with the market. 
An allowance of just over 3% of salary roll was provided for 
general staff increases. 
The Committee intends to review salaries of the executive 
directors on an annual basis, taking into account Group and 
individual performance, market conditions, and the remuneration 
arrangements of the senior management and the allowance for 
salary increase for the wider workforce.
In addition to base salary and pension the Group provides the 
executive directors with the following benefits: health insurance, 
membership of the Bovis Homes Regulated Car Scheme for 
Employees and death in service assurance.
Pensions
David Ritchie is a senior executive member of the Bovis Homes 
Pension Scheme (BHPS ). This is a contributory funded, defined 
benefit scheme, approved by HMRC.
From April 2011 the Group introduced a 20% of salary pension 
allowance for David Ritchie. Some or all of this allowance can be 
used in relation to his membership of the BHPS, to the extent  
that it remains beneficial in light of new pension legislation.  
The balance is paid as a non-bonusable and non-pensionable  
salary supplement.
Jonathan Hill is a member of the Bovis Homes Group Personal 
Pension Plan. The Plan is a contracted-in defined contribution 
arrangement. The Company's contribution for Jonathan Hill, since 
his appointment in 2010, was set at 7% of his basic salary.  
From January 2012 the contribution will be increased to 15% of 
basic salary to bring it in line with a market competitive position. 
There are no special early retirement or early termination provisions 
for executive directors.
Variable remuneration
Annual bonus
Policy, strategy and key changes
The purpose of the annual bonus is to drive and reward 
performance against stretching annual financial and non-financial 
goals which are consistent with the longer-term strategic aims of 
the business.
The bonus will normally be paid in cash. However, before paying 
cash bonuses, the Remuneration Committee reviews the proposed 
position regarding dividends. If no dividend is proposed, the 
Committee may choose to exercise its discretion to pay part, or 
all, of the bonus in ordinary shares, with the right to receive such 
shares normally deferred for two years.
The overall principles applying to the mix of performance  
measures are:
   At least 70% of the bonus will be based on financial measures, 
with the balance being based on non-financial measures.
   The financial criteria are likely to include one or more of profit 
before tax, cash flow and a capital return measure.
   The non-financial measures are metrics that are currently 
considered key to the performance of the business.
The Committee believe that these metrics are strongly aligned 
to the Group's business strategy and the creation of long-term 
shareholder value. The exact calibration of the bonus for the 
coming year, and the alignment of each measure with the business 
strategy is shown below.
The key change for 2012 has been the introduction of a Return 
on Invested Capital measure. The Committee believes that, in 
conjunction with a similar return measure in the LTIP, this metric 
aligns the way the business is managed with the key interest of 
shareholders, being the return achieved on their invested capital.

Bovis Homes Group  
Long Term Incentive Plan 2010
Policy, strategy and key changes
The Committee believes that a significant proportion of the  
overall remuneration package for executive directors should be 
linked to the delivery of shareholder value and performance  
against key financial metrics over the long term. The Long  
Term Incentive Plan therefore seeks to align the interests of 
management and shareholders and to place a significant amount 
of the total remuneration package at risk dependent on  
long-term performance.
Long term incentive awards are made in the form of performance 
shares or nil-cost options under the Bovis Homes Group Long 
Term Incentive Plan which was approved by shareholders at the 
2010 Annual General Meeting. Each award is made subject to 
the achievement of performance criteria as set out below and will 
ordinarily vest after three years. There is no cost to the participant 
and dividend equivalents will normally be paid on vesting shares.
The one key change to the Plan for 2012 is the introduction of 
a ROCE target. One-third of the 2012 award shall be measured 
according to performance against this target. 
The Committee believes that the introduction of a ROCE target is a 
further alignment of remuneration with business strategy, since this 
metric aligns the way the business is managed with the key interest 
of shareholders, being the return achieved on their invested capital. 
In order to balance both the long and short-term benefits of a 
return measure, the Committee has introduced a ROIC measure 
into the annual bonus. 
Approach for awards in the year ending 31/12/2012
Key features of the long term incentive arrangements for 
executive directors for 2012 are as follows:
   Award sizes remain at 100% of salary for 
executive directors.
   One-third of the award will be subject to relative 
TSR performance against a bespoke housebuilder 
comparator index
   One-third of the award will be subject to stretching 
cumulative EPS.
   One-third of the award will be subject to stretching 
ROCE performance targets.
Performance conditions
Total Shareholder Return (one-third of total award)
One-third of the 2012 award will vest according to the  
Company's TSR performance over a three year period against  
a bespoke unweighted index of housebuilding comparators.  
TSR performance relative to an unweighted index has been 
chosen as a performance measure as the Committee believe 
that this aligns reward with the delivery of superior market 
performance over the long term. The target for maximum vesting 
of outperformance of the index by 10% per annum is historically 
equal to at least upper quartile performance, and is thus deemed 
appropriately stretching.
TSR Target performance Maximum performance
Quantum 10% of the total award One-third of the total award
Performance measurement Equal to the median of the Index Median plus 10% per annum
Where TSR performance is between target and maximum 
performance levels, the level of vesting shall be determined  
pro-rata between the two points. 
TSR will be calculated using a three month averaging period at  
the start and end of the period to smooth the impact of share 
price volatility on vesting.  46		 |		Annual	report	and	accounts		 |		Governance

reference to EPS can be realised.
Return on Capital Employed (one-third of total award)
In setting minimum and maximum absolute ROCE targets 
for the 2012 awards, the Remuneration Committee has 
again considered data providing visibility over the three year 
performance period, including internal forecasts and analysts' 
forecasts. Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee has set 
absolute minimum and maximum ROCE targets for the 2012 
awards of 8.9% and 12.4%, to be measured in the third year 
of the performance period (2014).
Where ROCE performance is between target and maximum 
performance levels, the level of vesting shall be determined  
pro-rata between the two points.

awards made to the executive directors.

The Committee decided to use cumulative EPS targets for  
the 2012 awards.
In setting minimum and maximum absolute EPS targets for the 
2012 awards, the Remuneration Committee has considered 
data providing visibility over the three year performance  
period, including internal forecasts and analysts' forecasts. 
Use of a cumulative three year EPS target, first used for the 
2010 awards, was again considered appropriate, given the 
ongoing uncertain environment. 
Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee has set absolute 
minimum and maximum EPS targets of 100p and 136p per 
share to be measured on a cumulative basis over the three  
year performance period.

2009 LTIP award
The LTIP awarded in 2009 will lapse in full on 10 March 2012.  
Half of the award was measured against EPS performance, whilst 
the other half of the award was measured against TSR performance 
against an index.
The threshold EPS target was 20p, and maximum target was 50p, 
measured in the third year of the performance period. Actual EPS  
in 2011 increased over the vesting period by 90% to 17.5p. 
Therefore, none of the part of the award based on EPS will vest.
The threshold TSR target was performance equal to the index, 
and the maximum target was performance equal to 15% annual 
outperformance of the index. Actual TSR was below the median of 
the index, and therefore none of the award based on TSR will vest.
Bovis Homes Group PLC  
2009 Bonus Replacement Share Plan
The Bovis Homes Group PLC Bonus Replacement Share Plan was 
approved at the 2009 Annual General Meeting and was designed to 
encourage and reward participants for delivering business recovery 
that resulted in the creation of shareholder value.
The Plan was operated in 2009 only as an alternative to entitlement 
for consideration for annual cash bonus.
Bovis Homes Group PLC  
Executive Share Option Scheme
The Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme was 
established in 1997 and expired in 2007, with the granting of 
options being suspended in 2004. 
Shareholding guideline
Guidelines exist for executive directors in respect of ownership 
of Bovis Homes' shares. The Board expects executive directors 
benefiting from the exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards 
or exercise of share options to retain at least 50% of the net value 
derived from the exercise, after settling all costs and income tax 
due, as shares. This guideline is expected to be applied until such 
time as the executive director holds shares with a market value 
equal to basic annual salary.
Directors' interests
The directors' interests in the share capital of the Company are 
shown below. All interests are beneficial.
There were no changes in the holdings of ordinary shares of any 
of the directors between 31 December 2011 and 24 February 
2012 other than the normal monthly investment in partnership 
shares through the Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan.
The directors' interests in share options and awards under the 
Long Term Incentive Plan are detailed on page 51. There were  
no changes in the holdings of share options and awards under 
the 2009 Bonus Replacement Share Plan and the Long Term 
Incentive Plan between 31 December 2011 and 24 February 2012.  48		 |		Annual	report	and	accounts		 |		Governance

Total Shareholder Return performance graph*
*This graph illustrates five year TSR performance and therefore does not represent the period under 
which the Long Term Incentive Plan is measured.
As required by the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, the above 
graph shows the Total Shareholder Return of an ordinary share 
held in Bovis Homes Group PLC over the last five financial 
years, compared to the FTSE 250 index and the median of the 
FTSE 250 housebuilders over the same period. 
As a constituent of the FTSE 250, the Committee considers 
both these indices to be relevant benchmarks for comparison 
purposes. 
The middle market price of the Company's shares at  
31 December 2011 was  4.39 (2010:  4.14). During the  
year ended 31 December 2011 the share price recorded a 
middle market low of  3.27 and a high of  5.00.
Remuneration of senior management and 
other below board employees 
In addition to its responsibility for executive directors, the 
Committee is also involved in the consideration of the 
remuneration arrangements for the senior management team, 
in conjunction with the Chief Executive. 
The Committee believes that it is highly important that the 
remuneration of the senior management is aligned with that  
of the executive directors in order that the most senior 
individuals in the Company are driven to achieve the same 
overall strategic goals, but also that these individuals are 
rewarded for the performance of areas under their control  
and influence. A summary of the senior management 
remuneration is shown below.
Element of remuneration Alignment with strategy and remuneration arrangements of executive directors
Base	salary Set at market competitive levels taking into account the size and scope of the role, and the 
experience and past performance of the incumbent.
Annual	bonus Targets are similar to those for executives in order to create alignment, and include Group and 
divisional profitability, cash flow, management of land, ROIC and customer service targets.
Long	Term	Incentive	Plan Senior management employees participate in the long-term incentive plan, with the same 
targets as the executive directors. The Committee believes that this drives cohesive behaviour 
and the creation of long-term shareholder value. 
Total	Direct	Remuneration The Committee believes that, as for executive directors, a significant proportion of the total 
remuneration package for senior management should be variable and subject to performance.
In setting the level of pay, both fixed and variable, the Committee considers both 
competitiveness against the external market and the internal relativities in relation to the level of 
pay for executive directors, and the level of pay of the wider management and wider workforce.
Pensions Senior management are eligible to participate in either the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme or the 
defined contribution Bovis Homes Group Personal Pension Plan. The Committee is mindful of the 
same taxation considerations for senior management as it is for the executive directors.

The number of shares that will 
vest will be calculated on a 
straight-line basis for average 
share prices achieved between 
 5.50 and  7.00. 
The emoluments for 2011 for directors who served during  
the financial year are set out below. 
* As described in the 2010 Annual Report, prior to the 
consideration of the 2010 bonus awards, David Ritchie 
requested and was granted a bonus sacrifice arrangement 
under which  193,000 of performance bonus was sacrificed 
in exchange for an equivalent employer contribution to a 
qualifying personal pension arrangement. For clarity, the  
pre-sacrifice amount has been shown in the table above.
   David Ritchie also received  36,000 in the form of a non-
bonusable and non-pensionable salary supplement.
The performance condition for the award is linked to an 
average share price target to be measured on 7th May 2012. 
The average market value of a share achieved over the three 
months immediately preceding this date will determine the 
number of shares which will vest. Vesting will be calculated in 
accordance with the following table. Bovis	Homes	Group	PLC		 |		51
