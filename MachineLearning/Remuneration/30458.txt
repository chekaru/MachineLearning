 Overview
The Chairman and Chief Executive have described in their 
statements how 2012 has been a further year of strong profit 
growth for Bovis Homes. Revenue increased and all metrics 
improved, with basic earnings per share rising by 75% and 
Return on Capital Employed (ROCE ) adding 2.7% to  
reach 7.7%. The Group enters 2013 well positioned to further 
improve future returns through the compound effect of growing 
legal completions, the rise in the average sales price on new 
outlets and the increase in the operating margin. Additionally the 
future performance of the Group is being shaped by the ongoing 
acquisition of high quality consented and strategic land.
Remuneration policy
This progress is underpinned by our remuneration policy, which is 
considered to be working well and fully aligned with the Group's 
strategy. As a result, the policy remains unchanged in the period 
under review and to date and no changes are planned for 2013. 
The principal aim of our remuneration policy is to align  
executive remuneration with the interests of our shareholders  
in order to drive the creation of long term shareholder value.  
The Committee is committed to setting remuneration at a level 
which is deemed fair, and which rewards performance.
Whilst recognising its primary duty to shareholders and the 
Company the Committee is mindful of the high level of public 
and political scrutiny around executive remuneration.  
We are committed to a remuneration structure which does 
not guarantee reward through excessive levels of fixed pay or 
through inappropriate incentives, but one that rewards genuine, 
sustainable performance in line with shareholder interests.
Remuneration in 2012
As discussed in last year's report we have moved to make returns 
a greater focus of the business and its remuneration structure. 
These changes help ensure full alignment between management 
actions and the interests of investors and reflect feedback 
received from shareholders. 
During 2012, Return on Invested Capital (ROIC ) was introduced 
as one of the performance measures for the annual bonus plan 
and ROCE as one of the measures in the Long Term Incentive 
Plan. I am pleased to report that management have embraced 
these targets and the increase in ROIC to 8.0% reflects this. 
Indeed, the 2012 annual bonus has seen maximum payout 
achieved against this particular performance measure. 
Turning to the total annual bonus for 2012, I am delighted to 
say that strong performance against the financial and operational 
targets resulted in 84.2% of maximum being awarded, a similar 
level to that achieved for 2011. Profit before tax increased 
by 69%, there was strong focus on cash flow and customer 
satisfaction, and, of course, we saw the improvement in ROIC 
referred to above.
Regarding the Long Term Incentive Plan awards granted in 2010, 
50% will vest, due to the earnings per share (EPS ) performance 
condition being met in full. This illustrates the strong EPS out-
performance of the Group over the past three financial years, 
against stretching targets, with absolute cumulative EPS having 
reached 58.8 pence. However, the total shareholder return 
(TSR ) half of the award will lapse, with the performance of 
the Group being overshadowed by the recovery of others in the 
comparator group who started the three year performance period 
in relatively weaker positions.
Changes in remuneration policy for 2013
As mentioned above, the Remuneration Committee has 
reviewed its remuneration approach and concluded that it is 
serving the Group well, with no revisions envisaged for 2013. 
The Committee has also looked at the overall contribution 
of both the Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director 
and, at the end of 2012, decided that increases to their base 
salaries of 4.65% and 3.84% were appropriate. These changes 
came into effect from the start of 2013, with the Committee 
being confident that they were fully justified and commercially 
appropriate for the Group.
I would like to express my gratitude to my colleagues on the 
Committee for their support and valuable input during the year. 
I do hope you find that this report clearly explains the 
remuneration approach adopted at Bovis Homes Group PLC, and 
enables you to appreciate how it underpins the business growth 
and returns strategy. The Committee appreciates the dialogue 
and feedback from shareholders and hopes to receive your 
support at the AGM on 16 May 2013.
Colin	Holmes
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce the 2012 Directors' Remuneration 
Report, prepared by the Remuneration Committee and approved 
by the Board. Over the last year the Group made strong progress 
in delivering its growth strategy, with significant increases in 
profit and returns, coupled with further substantial investments 
in high quality residential land. The achievement of these results 
in 2012 and, indeed, the long term goals of the Group, are 
underpinned by the Committee's remuneration policy, which is 
set out in this report.

Remuneration report
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. The report 
also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of 
the Financial Services Authority, and describes how the Board 
has complied with the principles and provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code published in June 2010  
( the Code') relating to remuneration matters. The report 
will be presented at the AGM on 16 May 2013 for advisory 
approval and shareholders will be able to ask questions on  
the report at the AGM.
The report is divided into two parts. 
   The first part sets out our remuneration policy and the 
governance structures which underpin this policy. This part  
is not required to be audited. 
   The second part contains the remuneration tables that 
have been audited in accordance with the relevant  
statutory requirements. 
Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee 
The following table details the members of the Remuneration 
Committee, their date of appointment, their role, and the 
number of meetings the Committee had during the year and 
their respective attendance: 
 
Name
 
Date of appointment

Colin Holmes 01/12/2006 Chairman 5/5
Alastair Lyons 01/10/2008 Member 5/5
John Warren 01/03/2006 Member 5/5
All members of the Committee are independent and have 
no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in 
the matters to be decided, and no day-to-day involvement in 
running the business.
The Committee determines the remuneration packages 
(including incentive plans and their performance criteria) and 
any changes to service contracts of the Chairman, executive 
directors and other designated senior executives including the 
Company Secretary. 
The Board determines the fees and overall remuneration of  
the non-executive directors without the non-executive 
directors' participation.
No director or senior executive is involved in any decisions as  
to his or her own remuneration. 
The Committee's terms of reference are available on the 
Company's website (www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk/investor-
centre/corporate-governance).
Advisers to the Committee
During the year, the Committee took advice from Deloitte 
LLP, its appointed advisers since August 2009. Deloitte provide 
independent advice to the Committee on all aspects of 
executive remuneration. Deloitte attend Remuneration 
Committee meetings when invited by the Chairman of  
the Committee. Deloitte has also provided VAT advice to the 
Company during 2012. Deloitte are a founder member of 
the Remuneration Consultants Group and have signed the 
voluntary Code of Practice for remuneration consultants. 
The Committee always starts its meetings without executive 
management present. Thereafter the Committee may and 
does call upon Malcolm Harris (Chairman) and David Ritchie 
(Chief Executive) to assist in its discussions and deliberations 
on matters not pertaining to their own remuneration, service 
agreement or terms and conditions of employment. They were 
invited to attend all Committee meetings during the year.  
The Committee is also supported by Martin Palmer  
(Company Secretary), who acts as secretary to the Committee. 
No person was present during any part of a meeting when 
their own remuneration was being discussed. 
Principles of the remuneration policy
The Committee's remuneration policy is designed to provide 
a market competitive, performance-related package which 
supports and facilitates the delivery of the Company's strategy 
and the creation of long-term shareholder value. The key 
principles of the remuneration policy are:
   to ensure that individual rewards and incentives fairly reflect 
the performance of the individual, the Company and the 
interests of shareholders;
   to provide a market competitive reward to attract, retain 
and incentivise executives of the calibre needed to deliver  
on the Company's strategy and to create long-term 
shareholder value;  Bovis	Homes	Group	PLC		 |		 41
   the total package should include a significant variable element 
which is aligned to the performance of the Company, both in the 
short term and over the longer-term;
   the package should be linked to the Company's strategic goals, 
and how success against these goals is measured;
   executives should build up shareholdings in the Company, 
principally through the vesting of long term incentive awards;
   the policy should uphold the key principles of best practice on 
executive remuneration; and
   remuneration should be designed to promote the long-term 
success of the Company and should not reward excessive risk 
taking and should not reward failure.
In setting the remuneration arrangements for the executives 
and senior management, the Committee considers the pay and 
conditions of the employees throughout the Group.
Competitive positioning
When considering how to position the remuneration packages for 
the executive directors, the Committee considers market data from 
UK listed companies of a similar size and complexity, as well as 
specific practice in the housebuilding sector. This data is provided 
by Deloitte, as independent advisers to the Committee.
The Committee positions salaries and incentive opportunities 
at what would be considered a market competitive level, whilst 
not seeking to match the median . As explained above the 
aim is that the arrangements should motivate management to 
deliver stretching performance in the interests of shareholders. 
Outperformance for shareholders should be recognised with 
superior reward.
Summary of remuneration policy

The salaries of the executive directors with effect from 1 January 
2013 are as follows:

2013 base salary
% increase  
from 2012
David Ritchie CEO  450,000 4.65%
Jonathan Hill GFD  270,000 3.84%
 
In setting executive director salaries the Committee is always 
mindful of the need to avoid excessive and unjustified reward. 
Changes are only approved if full justification exists.
The increase for the CEO, David Ritchie, of 4.65% is warranted 
given his continued outstanding leadership and contribution to  
the Group. This is reflected in the strong profit improvement 
delivered by the Company in 2012 and the excellent positioning 
of the Group for 2013 following a difficult period for the house 
building industry.
The Committee decided that given his performance and increasing 
contribution to the Group, an increase of 3.84% would be made 
to the salary of Jonathan Hill, the GFD. 
An allowance of just over 3% of salary roll was provided for 
general staff increases. 
The Committee intends to review salaries of the executive 
directors on an annual basis, taking into account Group and 
individual performance, market conditions, and the remuneration 
arrangements of the senior management and the allowance for 
salary increase for the wider workforce.
In addition to base salary and pension the Group provides the 
executive directors with the following benefits: health insurance, 
membership of the Bovis Homes Regulated Car Scheme for 
Employees and death in service assurance.
Pensions
David Ritchie is a senior executive member of the Bovis Homes 
Pension Scheme (BHPS ). This is a contributory funded, defined 
benefit scheme, approved by HMRC. He receives a pension 
allowance of 20% of salary and some or all of this allowance can 
be used in relation to his membership of the BHPS, to the extent  
that it remains beneficial in light of new pension legislation.  
The balance is paid as a non-bonusable and non-pensionable  
salary supplement.
Jonathan Hill is a member of the Bovis Homes Group Personal 
Pension Plan. The Plan is a contracted-in defined contribution 
arrangement. The Company's contribution for Jonathan Hill is  
15% of his basic salary. 
There are no special early retirement or early termination provisions 
for executive directors.
Variable remuneration
Annual bonus
Policy, strategy and key changes
The purpose of the annual bonus is to drive and reward 
performance against stretching annual financial and non-financial 
goals which are consistent with the longer-term strategic aims of 
the business.
The bonus will normally be paid in cash. However, before paying 
cash bonuses, the Remuneration Committee reviews the proposed 
position regarding dividends. If no dividend is proposed, the 
Committee may choose to exercise its discretion to pay part, or 
all, of the bonus in ordinary shares, with the right to receive such 
shares normally deferred for two years.
The overall principles applying to the mix of performance  
measures are:
   At least 70% of the bonus will be based on financial measures, 
with the balance being based on non-financial measures.
   The financial criteria are likely to include one or more of profit 
before tax, cash flow and a capital return measure.
   The non-financial measures are metrics that are currently 
considered key to the performance of the business.
The Committee believe that these metrics are strongly aligned 
to the Group's business strategy and the creation of long-term 
shareholder value. The exact calibration of the bonus for the 
coming year, and the alignment of each measure with the business 
strategy is shown below.
Following a review of how reward is delivered and what reward 
is delivered for under the annual bonus scheme, it was concluded 
that the annual bonus scheme continues to measure key elements 
of performance that are in line with the Company's stated strategy 
over the shorter term and so no changes are to be made for 2013 
in terms of either performance measures or quantum.

Assessment for the year ending 31 December 2012
The maximum opportunity for executive directors for the year ending  
31 December 2012 was 100% of salary. A breakdown of the  
performance against the measurement criteria is shown below. Bovis Homes Group  
Long Term Incentive Plan 2010
Policy, strategy and key changes
The Committee believes that a significant proportion of the  
overall remuneration package for executive directors should be 
linked to the delivery of shareholder value and performance  
against key financial metrics over the long term. The Long  
Term Incentive Plan therefore seeks to align the interests of 
management and shareholders and to place a significant amount 
of the total remuneration package at risk dependent on  
long-term performance.
Long term incentive awards are made in the form of performance 
shares or nil-cost options under the Bovis Homes Group Long 
Term Incentive Plan which was approved by shareholders at the 
2010 Annual General Meeting. Each award is made subject to 
the achievement of performance criteria as set out below and will 
ordinarily vest after three years. There is no cost to the participant 
and dividend equivalents will normally be paid on vesting shares.
During 2012 a ROCE target was introduced. No changes are 
proposed for 2013. 
Approach for awards in the year ending 31/12/2013
Key features of the long term incentive arrangements for 
executive directors for 2013 are as follows:
   Award sizes remain at 100% of salary for 
executive directors.
   One-third of the award will be subject to relative 
TSR performance against a bespoke housebuilder 
comparator index.
   One-third of the award will be subject to stretching 
cumulative EPS.
   One-third of the award will be subject to stretching 
ROCE performance targets.
Performance conditions
Total Shareholder Return (one-third of total award)
One-third of the 2013 award will vest according to the  
Company's TSR performance over a three year period against  
a bespoke unweighted index of housebuilding comparators.  
TSR performance relative to an unweighted index has been 
chosen as a performance measure as the Committee believe 
that this aligns reward with the delivery of superior market 
performance over the long term. The target for maximum vesting 
of outperformance of the index by 10% per annum is historically 
equal to at least upper quartile performance, and is thus deemed 
appropriately stretching.
Where TSR performance is between target and maximum 
performance levels, the level of vesting shall be determined  
pro-rata between the two points. 
TSR will be calculated using a three month averaging period at  
the start and end of the period to smooth the impact of share 
price volatility on vesting.

Historical LTIP awards
The table below summarises the historical long term incentive awards made to the executive directors. 
Earnings per share (one-third of total award)
The Committee decided to use cumulative EPS targets for  
the 2013 awards.
In setting minimum and maximum absolute EPS targets for the 
2013 awards, the Remuneration Committee has considered 
data providing visibility over the three year performance  
period, including internal forecasts and analysts' forecasts. 
Use of a cumulative three year EPS target, first used for the 
2010 awards, was again considered appropriate, given the 
ongoing uncertain environment. 
Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee has set absolute 
minimum and maximum EPS targets of 130p and 165p per 
share to be measured on a cumulative basis over the three  
year performance period. 
Where EPS performance is between target and maximum 
performance levels, the level of vesting shall be determined  
pro-rata between the two points. Where EPS falls below  
the minimum, none of the shares in the award judged by 
reference to EPS can be realised.

has set absolute minimum and maximum ROCE targets for the 
2013 awards of 11.5% and 14.5%, to be measured in the third 
year of the performance period (2015).

2010 LTIP award
The LTIP awarded in 2010 will vest to the extent of 50% on 
9 March 2013. Half of the award was measured against EPS 
performance, whilst the other half of the award was measured 
against TSR performance against an index.
The threshold EPS target was 35p, and maximum target was 50p 
measured on a cumulative three year basis. Absolute cumulative EPS 
over the 3 year performance period was 58.8p. Therefore, all of the 
part of the award based on EPS will vest.
The threshold TSR target was performance equal to the index, 
and the maximum target was performance equal to 10% annual 
outperformance of the index. Actual TSR was below the median of 
the index, and therefore none of the award based on TSR will vest.
Bovis Homes Group PLC  
2009 Bonus Replacement Share Plan
The Bovis Homes Group PLC Bonus Replacement Share Plan was 
approved at the 2009 Annual General Meeting and was designed to 
encourage and reward participants for delivering business recovery 
that resulted in the creation of shareholder value.
The Plan was operated in 2009 only as an alternative to entitlement 
for consideration for annual cash bonus. The performance condition  
was linked to an average share price target to be measured at the 
end of the performace period. The average market value of a share 
was below that required for any of the awards to vest and the 
Committee confirmed that all awards had lapsed in full.
Bovis Homes Group PLC  
Executive Share Option Scheme
The Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme was 
established in 1997 and expired in 2007, with the granting of 
options being suspended in 2004. 
Shareholding guidelines
Guidelines exist for executive directors in respect of ownership 
of Bovis Homes' shares. The Board expects executive directors 
benefiting from the exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards or 
exercise of share options to retain 100% of the net value derived 
from the exercise as shares, after settling all costs and income tax 
due, until such time as the executive director holds shares with an 
historic cost equal to their basic annual salary. This is an increase 
from 50% of the net value derived last year and is intended to 
further align executives with the long term interests of shareholders.
Directors' interests
The directors' interests in the share capital of the Company are 
shown below. All interests are beneficial.
There were no changes in the holdings of ordinary shares of any 
of the directors between 31 December 2012 and 22 February 
2013 other than the normal monthly investment in partnership 
shares through the Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan.
The directors' interests in share options and awards under the 
Long Term Incentive Plan are detailed on page 51. There were  
no changes in the holdings of share options and awards under 
the Long Term Incentive Plan between 31 December 2012 and  
22 February 2013.  48		 |		 Annual	report	and	accounts		 |		 Governance

Total Shareholder Return performance graph*
* This graph illustrates five year TSR performance and therefore does not represent the period under 
which the Long Term Incentive Plan is measured.
As required by the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, the above 
graph shows the Total Shareholder Return of an ordinary share 
held in Bovis Homes Group PLC over the last five financial 
years, compared to the FTSE 250 index and the median of the 
FTSE 250 housebuilders over the same period. 
As a constituent of the FTSE 250, the Committee considers 
both these indices to be relevant benchmarks for comparison 
purposes. 
The middle market price of the Company's shares at  
31 December 2012 was  5.75 (2011:  4.39). During the  
year ended 31 December 2012 the share price recorded a 
middle market low of  3.99 and a high of  5.75. As at  
the date of publication of this report the share price stood  
at  6.72.
Remuneration of senior management and 
other below board employees 
In addition to its responsibility for executive directors, the 
Committee is also involved in the consideration of the 
remuneration arrangements for the senior management team, 
in conjunction with the Chief Executive. 
The Committee believes that it is highly important that the 
remuneration of the senior management is aligned with that  
of the executive directors in order that the most senior 
individuals in the Company are driven to achieve the same 
overall strategic goals, but also that these individuals are 
rewarded for the performance of areas under their control  
and influence. A summary of the senior management 
remuneration is shown below.
Element of remuneration Alignment with strategy and remuneration arrangements of executive directors
Base	salary Set at market competitive levels taking into account the size and scope of the role, and the 
experience and past performance of the incumbent.
Annual	bonus Targets are similar to those for executive directors in order to create alignment, and include 
Group and divisional profitability, cash flow, land acquisition, ROIC and customer service targets.
Long	Term	Incentive	Plan Senior management employees participate in the long-term incentive plan, with the same 
targets as the executive directors. The Committee believes that this drives cohesive behaviour 
and the creation of long-term shareholder value. 
Total	Direct	Remuneration The Committee believes that, as for executive directors, a significant proportion of the total 
remuneration package for senior management should be variable and subject to performance.
In setting the level of pay, both fixed and variable, the Committee considers both 
competitiveness against the external market and the internal relativities in relation to the level of 
pay for executive directors, and the level of pay of the wider management and wider workforce.
Pensions Senior management are eligible to participate in either the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme or the 
defined contribution Bovis Homes Group Personal Pension Plan. The Committee is mindful of the 
same taxation considerations for senior management as it is for the executive directors.
