Remuneration report
Our governance Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce the 2013 Directors' remuneration report. 
It covers the remuneration of the executive and non-executive 
directors and is divided into two sections, as required by the new 
remuneration reporting regulations. The policy report contains the 
three year remuneration policy to be submitted to shareholders in a 
binding vote at the 2014 AGM and the annual remuneration report 
explains the application of the policy in 2013 and 2014.
Overview
In 2013 Bovis Homes again delivered significant revenue and 
profit growth. In the year, basic earnings per share rose by 49% 
and Return on Capital Employed (ROCE ) reached 10.4% 
(2012: 7.7%). The Group also acquired significant levels of high 
quality consented land, entering 2014 well positioned to further 
improve returns for shareholders. 
The remuneration policy of the Group underpins the 
achievement of these results and the long term goals of the 
Group for the coming years. The policy remained unchanged 
in the period under review and will do so for 2014, with the 
exception of the proposed increase to maximum award levels for 
the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which are set out below.
Remuneration in 2013
For 2013, the strong performance against the stretching financial 
and operational targets resulted in 98% of maximum being 
awarded for the annual bonus. The year saw the achievement of 
strong pre-tax profit growth (+48%) and importantly the Return 
on Invested Capital also increased to 10.4%.
The LTIP awards granted in 2011 will see 50% of awards vest 
due to the earnings per share (EPS ) performance condition 
being met in full. This demonstrates the strong EPS out-
performance of the Group over the past three financial years, 
against stretching targets, with absolute cumulative EPS reaching 
93.1 pence. The second half of the LTIP award, based on 
relative total shareholder return (TSR ), will lapse given that the 
comparator group achieved a median TSR of 188% over the last 
three years. 
Changes in remuneration for 2014
The Board is optimistic about the future prospects of the Group 
and wants to ensure that the executive directors are fully 
motivated to ensure all the potential opportunities are fully 
realised for the benefit of its shareholders. The Remuneration 
Committee, as part of an overall review of executive 
remuneration policy, therefore focused on long term 
performance related pay to ensure it is appropriately set for 
the future. As a result, the Committee is proposing that the 
maximum award under the LTIP be increased from 100% to 
150% of salary for the Chief Executive and to 125% of salary 
for the Group Finance Director. 
All other terms of the LTIP will remain unchanged and vesting 
will ultimately be dependent on the achievement of stretching 
performance targets. A resolution will be put to shareholders at 
the 2014 AGM to approve this change. Given the importance 
of this proposal, I have consulted with the Group's major 
shareholders, who have indicated their support, subject to 
stretching targets being set by the Committee.
The Committee also considered the scale of the roles performed 
by both the Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director, 
deciding that it was appropriate to increase their base salaries by 
3.33% and 3.70% respectively with effect from the start  
of 2014. The Committee is confident that both the salary 
and LTIP award increases are fully justified and commercially 
appropriate for the Group. 
Conclusion
I do hope you find that this report clearly explains the 
remuneration approach adopted at Bovis Homes and enables you 
to appreciate how it underpins the business growth and returns 
strategy. The Committee considers the remuneration policy fair 
and fully aligned with the interests of shareholders and looks 
forward to your support for the associated AGM votes.
Lastly, I am stepping down from the Board at the AGM on  
16 May 2014, after seven years as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee. The role of Committee chair will be 
taken on by Alastair Lyons, whose significant experience will 
be of great benefit to the position. In retiring from the Board, I 
would like to thank my colleagues and the Group's shareholders 
for their support during my time at Bovis Homes.

Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Committee's principal responsibilities are to set, review and approve the remuneration policy and to determine the remuneration 
packages (including incentive plans and their performance criteria) and any changes to service contracts of the Chairman, executive 
directors and other designated senior executives including the Group Company Secretary. The Committee's terms of reference are available 
on the Company's website (www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk/investor-centre/corporate-governance).
The remuneration policy
The Committee's remuneration policy is designed to provide a market competitive, performance-related package which supports and 
facilitates the delivery of the Company's strategy and the creation of long-term shareholder value. This remuneration policy will be 
proposed for adoption at the 2014 AGM. If approved it will apply on a legislative basis immediately following shareholder approval on  
16 May 2014.
The Committee keeps the remuneration policy under review to ensure it promotes the attraction, retention and motivation of the high 
performing executive talent required to deliver the business strategy. It is required that the policy be put to shareholders for approval 
every three years. Should any changes be required before the end of a three year period, the amended policy will be put to shareholders, 
following shareholder consultation as appropriate.
Components of the remuneration framework for executive directors
The policy table below summarises the main components of the remuneration framework, as detailed further in the report, a large 
proportion of which is performance related.
Purpose and link  
to strategy
Operation Opportunity Performance metrics
Fixed pay
Base salary
To attract and retain 
high performing talent 
required to deliver 
the business strategy, 
providing core reward 
for the role. 
Ordinarily reviewed annually.
The review typically considers 
competitive positioning, the 
individual's role, experience and 
performance, business performance 
and salary increases throughout  
the Group.
Market benchmarking exercises 
are undertaken periodically 
and judgement is used in their 
application.
Whilst we do not consider it 
appropriate to set a maximum 
base salary level, any increases will 
take into account the individual's 
skills, experience, performance, the 
external environment and the pay of 
employees throughout the Group.
Whilst generally the intention is to 
maintain a link with employee pay 
and conditions, in circumstances such 
as significant changes in responsibility 
or size and scope of role or 
progression in a role, higher increases 
may be awarded.
Thus, where a new director is 
appointed at a salary below market 
competitive levels to reflect initial 
experience, it may be increased 
over time subject to satisfactory 
performance and market conditions.
Not applicable.
Benefits
To provide market 
competitive benefits 
consistent with role. 
Benefits typically include medical 
insurance, life assurance, membership 
of the Bovis Homes Regulated Car 
Scheme for Employees or cash car 
allowance, annual leave, occupational 
sick pay, health screening, personal 
accident insurance, and participation 
in all employee share schemes 
(SAYE and SIP). In line with business 
requirements, other expenses may be 
paid, such as relocation expenses.
We do not consider it appropriate to 
set a maximum benefits value as this 
may change periodically.
Not applicable.
Pension
To attract and retain 
talent by enabling long 
term pension saving.
Executives joining the Group 
since January 2002 can choose to 
participate in a defined contribution 
arrangement, or may receive a cash 
equivalent. A salary supplement may 
also be paid as part of a pension 
allowance arrangement.
Executives who joined the Group 
prior to January 2002 can continue 
to participate in the defined benefit 
pension arrangement, which is closed 
to new members. 
A pension allowance of up to 
20% of base salary may be paid to 
include membership of a pension 
arrangement, with any balance 
payable as a salary supplement.
Not applicable.

Policy report
Purpose and link  
to strategy
Operation Opportunity Performance metrics
Variable pay
Annual bonus
To incentivise and 
reward the delivery 
of near term business 
targets and objectives.
The annual bonus scheme is a 
discretionary scheme and is reviewed 
prior to the start of each financial 
year to ensure that it appropriately 
supports the business strategy.
Performance measures and stretching 
targets are set by the Committee.
Bonuses are normally paid in cash. 
In any year in which no dividend is 
proposed discretion may be exercised 
to pay part, or all, of the bonus  
in ordinary shares, deferred for  
two years.
Actual bonus amounts are 
determined by assessing performance 
against the agreed targets after 
the year end. The results are then 
reviewed to ensure that any bonus 
paid accurately reflects the underlying 
performance of the business.
The annual bonus scheme offers 
a maximum opportunity of up to 
100% of base salary. Achievement 
of stretching performance targets is 
required to earn the maximum. 
Performance measures are selected to 
focus executives on strategic priorities, 
providing alignment with shareholder 
interests and are reviewed annually.
Weightings and targets are reviewed and 
set at the start of each financial year.
Financial metrics will comprise at least 
70% of the bonus and are likely to 
include one or more of:
  a profit based measure
  a cash based measure
  a capital return measure
Non-financial metrics, key to business 
performance, will be used for the balance.
Below threshold performance delivers no 
bonus and target performance achieves a 
bonus of 50% of base salary.
Long Term 
Incentive Plan 
(LTIP )
To incentivise, reward 
and retain executives 
over the longer term 
and align the interests 
of management and 
shareholders.
Typically, annual awards are made 
under the LTIP.
Performance is measured over a 
performance period of not less 
than three years. LTIP awards do 
not normally vest until the third 
anniversary of the date of the grant.
Awards may be granted with the 
benefit of dividend equivalents, so 
that vested shares are increased 
by the number of shares equal to 
dividends paid from the date of grant 
to the date of exercise. 
The maximum annual award, under 
normal circumstances, is as follows:
   150% of base salary for the CEO. 
   125% of base salary for the GFD.
In exceptional circumstances an 
award may be granted under the 
LTIP rules up to 200% of base salary. 
The performance measures applied to LTIP 
awards are reviewed annually to ensure 
they remain relevant to strategic priorities 
and aligned to shareholder interests. 
Weightings and targets are reviewed and 
set prior to each award.
Performance measures will include long 
term performance targets, of which 
relative TSR will comprise at least one 
third and financial performance metrics 
will comprise the balance.
Below threshold performance realises 0% 
of the total award, target performance 
realises 30% and maximum performance 
realises 100%.
Notes to the policy table
The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take 
account of a change in legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
There are no provisions for the recovery of sums paid. The Company does not operate malus or clawback because the majority of measures approved by 
the Committee are outcome measures. Flexibility is retained to amend bonus outcomes if they do not reflect business performance.
The executive directors may request and the Company may grant salary and bonus sacrifice arrangements.
The LTIP rules permit the substitution or variance of performance conditions to produce a fairer measure of performance as a result of an unforeseen event 
or transaction and include discretions for upwards adjustment to the number of shares to be realised in the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement 
or voluntary winding up. Non-significant changes to the performance metrics may be made by use of discretion under the LTIP rules. Awards are normally 
satisfied in shares, although there is flexibility to settle in cash.
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including exercising any discretions available to it in 
connection with such payments) that are not in line with the policy table set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed:
(i) before the policy came into effect; or
(ii)  at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration 
for the individual becoming a director of the Company. 
For these purposes payments  includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and an award over shares is agreed  at the time the 
award is granted.
Performance measures for the annual bonus scheme and the LTIP are selected to focus the executive directors on strategic priorities, both short term and 
those related to long term sustainable performance, providing alignment with shareholder interests. Targets for each performance measure are then set  
by the Committee in light of strategic objectives over the short term for the annual bonus scheme and over at least a three year performance period for 
the LTIP. In setting targets the Committee takes into account a number of reference points including internal and analysts' forecasts. 46  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Our governance

Illustration of the application of the remuneration policy
Our aim is to ensure that superior reward is only paid for exceptional performance, with a substantial proportion of executive directors' 
reward opportunity being performance related. The charts below set out remuneration scenarios for each executive director at three 
levels of performance, as a percentage of the total reward opportunity and as a total value.

   Minimum performance reflects base salary as at 1 January 2014 and benefits and pension paid in 2013 (2014 policy for the defined 
contribution arrangement) as set out in the single figure on page 50.
   Target performance reflects base salary as at 1 January 2014, benefits and pension paid in 2013 (2014 policy for the defined 
contribution arrangement) as set out in the single figure on page 50, cash bonus at 50% of maximum and LTIP vesting at threshold of 
30% of maximum.
   Maximum performance reflects base salary as at 1 January 2014, benefits and pension paid in 2013 (2014 policy for the defined 
contribution arrangement) as set out in the single figure on page 50, cash bonus at 100% of maximum and LTIP vesting at maximum 
of 100%.
   No share price, dividends or discount rate assumptions have been included in the charts above.
Non-executive director and chairman fees
The Board, comprising the Chairman and the executive directors, sets the remuneration of the non-executive directors, without  
their participation. The Remuneration Committee, with the Chairman absenting himself from discussions, sets the remuneration of 
the Chairman who receives an all-inclusive fee. The level of fees must be within the limit approved by shareholders, contained in the 
Articles of Association. Non-executive directors and the Chairman do not participate in the annual bonus scheme or the LTIP and are 
not eligible to join the Group's pension schemes. All non-executive director and chairman fees are payable in cash and there are no 
additional fees or other items in the nature of remuneration.
Purpose and link

Operation Opportunity Performance metrics
To attract and retain 
non-executive directors

Approach to recruitment
In agreeing a remuneration package for a new executive director, it would be expected that the structure and quantum of variable pay 
elements would reflect those set out in the policy table above. However, the Committee would retain the discretion to flex the balance 
between annual and long-term incentives and the measures used to assess performance for these elements, with the intention that a 
significant proportion would be delivered in shares. Salary would reflect the skills and experience of the individual, and may be set at a level 
to allow future progression to reflect performance in the role. 
On recruitment, relocation benefits may be paid as appropriate.
This overall approach would also apply to internal appointments, with the proviso that any commitments entered into before promotion 
which are inconsistent with this policy can continue to be honoured under the policy. Similarly, if an executive director is appointed following 
the Company's acquisition of or merger with another company, legacy terms and conditions would be honoured.
An executive director may initially be hired on a contract requiring 24 months' notice which then reduces pro-rata over the first year of the 
contract to requiring 12 months' notice.
The Committee may award compensation for the forfeiture of awards from a previous employer in such form as the Committee considers 
appropriate taking account of all relevant factors including the expected value of the award, performance achieved or likely to be achieved, 
the proportion of the performance period remaining and the form of the award. There is no specific limit on the value of such awards, but 
the Committee's intention is that the value awarded would be equivalent to the value forfeited.
Maximum variable pay will be in line with the maximum set out in the policy table above (excluding buy-outs). The Committee retains 
discretion to make appropriate remuneration decisions outside the standard Policy to meet the individual circumstances when:
   An interim appointment is made to a fill an executive director role on a short-term basis.
   Exceptional circumstances require that the Chairman or a non-executive director takes on an executive function on a short-term basis.
For non-executive directors, the Board would consider the appropriate fees for a new appointment taking into account the existing level 
of fees paid to the non-executive directors, the experience and ability of the new non-executive director and the time commitment and 
responsibility of the role.
Service contracts and exit payments policy
The current executive directors' service contracts contain the key elements shown below.
Provision Detailed terms
Notice period
Termination payment
12 months by either employer or director
Up to 12 months' salary (excluding bonus or other enhancement)
The executive directors' service contracts do not contain specific provision for compensation in the event of early termination, with the 
exception of 12 months' base salary in the event of removal at an AGM.
When determining exit payments, the Committee would take account of a variety of factors, including individual and business performance, 
the obligation for the director to mitigate loss (for example, by gaining new employment), the director's length of service and any other 
relevant circumstances, such as ill health. A departing director may also be entitled to a payment in respect of statutory rights. Should a 
departing director be required to retire and be eligible for an early retirement pension under the terms of the defined benefit pension 
arrangement, an actuarial reduction will only be applied, in accordance with the rules, if the departing director has not reached age 55.
The Committee would distinguish between types of leaver in respect of incentive plans. Good leavers  (death, ill-health, agreed 
retirement, redundancy or any other reason at the discretion of the Committee) may be considered for a bonus payment having completed 
the full year and part year bonus payments may be paid and LTIP awards may vest taking into account performance conditions and pro 
rating for time in employment during the performance period, unless the Committee determines otherwise. The LTIP rules include discretion 
for upwards adjustment to the number of shares to be realised for good leavers  and, in exceptional circumstances, adjustment to the 
realisation date. In all other leaver circumstances, the Committee would decide the approach taken, which would ordinarily mean that 
leavers would not be entitled to consideration for a bonus and LTIP awards would lapse. 
The appointment of the Chairman and each of the non-executive directors is for an initial period of three years, which is renewable for 
further terms, and is terminable by the Chairman / non-executive director (as applicable) or the Company on twelve months' notice. 
No contractual payments would be due on termination. There are no specific provisions for compensation on early termination for the 
non-executive directors, with the exception of entitlement to compensation equivalent to 12 months' fees or, if less, the balance of 
appointment, in the event of removal at an AGM.
Policy report 48  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Our governance
Remuneration report
Change of control
The LTIP rules include discretion for upwards adjustment to the number of shares to be realised, subject to the performance 
conditions and awards being pro-rated for service, in the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement or voluntary winding up.
Additionally, all the Company's share plans contain provisions relating to change of control. In general, outstanding awards would 
normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, to the extent that any applicable performance conditions have been 
satisfied at that time, reflecting the time period to the date of the event.
External directorships
Executive directors may, if so authorised by the Board, accept appointments as non-executive directors of suitable companies and 
organisations outside the Group. 
Pay and conditions throughout the Group
The pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group are considered by the Committee in setting remuneration policy for 
the executive directors and senior management. The Committee is kept regularly informed on the pay and benefits provided to 
employees and base salary increase data from the annual salary review for general staff is considered when reviewing executive 
directors' salaries and those of senior management. The Committee does not directly consult with employees when setting 
remuneration policy for the executive directors. 
Difference in the Company's policy on remuneration of directors compared to employees
The remuneration policy for the executive directors is designed with pay and conditions throughout the Group in mind.  
The Committee believes that some differences are necessary to reflect responsibility and provide appropriate focus and  
motivation for delivery of the Group's strategy. Executive directors, therefore, have a higher bonus opportunity than employees 
generally to motivate them to achieve stretching annual targets and they participate in the LTIP to provide focus on long term 
sustainable performance. This approach is designed to provide an appropriate emphasis on performance related pay.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Company is committed to ongoing dialogue with shareholders and welcomes feedback on directors' remuneration.  
Feedback received from meetings during the year and in relation to the AGM is considered, together with guidance from 
shareholder representative bodies more generally, and taken into account in the annual review of remuneration policy.  
The Committee believes that it has a responsible approach to directors' pay and that its policy is appropriate and fit for purpose.
Support from shareholders is evidenced by the 99.3% approval of the 2012 Directors' Remuneration Report at the 2013 AGM 
(see the annual remuneration report for further details). A letter was sent to major shareholders on 8 January 2014 setting out the 
proposed increase to maximum award levels for the LTIP and their feedback indicated that they were supportive of this change.

Annual bonus payment in respect of 2013
The maximum opportunity for executive directors for the year ending 31 December 2013 was 100% of salary, the same as in previous 
years. A breakdown of the performance against the measurement criteria is shown below. All targets were set towards the end of 2012. 
The Committee has decided not to disclose the full detail of performance targets retrospectively as they are considered commercially 
sensitive and are expected to remain so for some time, being indicative performance indicators closely linked to the Group's growth strategy.

Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan
Long term incentive awards are made in the form of performance shares or nil-cost options under the Bovis Homes Group Long 
Term Incentive Plan which was approved by shareholders at the 2010 Annual General Meeting. Each award is made subject to 
the achievement of performance criteria as set out below and will ordinarily vest after three years. Discretions available to the 
Committee contained in the LTIP rules are set out in the policy table and also in the exit payments policy.
Awards vesting in respect of 2013
The LTIP awards made in 2011 were measured over the three year period to 31 December 2013 and will vest to the extent of 50% 
on 15 March 2014. Half of the award was measured against EPS performance, whilst the other half of the award was measured 
against TSR performance against an index.
The threshold EPS target was 55p, and maximum target was 80p measured on a cumulative three year basis. Absolute cumulative 
EPS over the three year performance period was 93.1p. Therefore, all of the part of the award based on EPS will vest.
The threshold TSR target was performance equal to the index and the maximum target was performance equal to 10% annual 
outperformance of the index. Actual TSR was below the median of the index of 188% and therefore none of the award based on 
TSR will vest.
Awards granted on 26 February 2013 (audited)
Awards of 110,854 shares were made to executive directors at 100% of basic salary at a grant price of  6.495, exercisable in 2016 
and subject to a three year performance period ending on 31 December 2015, as follows:
 
Executive director
 
Type of award
Number of shares 
awarded
  Face value at date

 % of face value that  
would vest at threshold
David Ritchie Performance share award 69,284 450 30
Jonathan Hill Performance share award 41,570 270 30
The performance measures are unchanged from the prior year, namely TSR (33.3%), EPS (33.3%) and ROCE (33.3%).
The performance targets are: 
   TSR - threshold performance equal to the median of the comparator group and maximum performance at median plus 10% per 
annum (unchanged from the prior year).
   EPS - threshold performance at cumulative EPS of 130 pence and maximum performance at cumulative EPS of 165 pence.
   ROCE - threshold performance at 11.5% and maximum performance at 14.5%.

Total Shareholder Return (one-third of total award)
One-third of the award vests according to the Company's TSR performance over a three year period against a bespoke unweighted index 
of housebuilding comparators. TSR performance relative to an unweighted index has been chosen as a performance measure as the 
Committee believe that this aligns reward with the delivery of superior market performance over the long term.

Executive Share Option Scheme
The Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme was established in 1997 and expired in 2007, with the granting of 
options being suspended in 2004. The last options granted under the Scheme in 2003 vested in 2012.
Pensions
David Ritchie is a senior executive member of the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme (BHPS ). This is a contributory funded, defined 
benefit scheme, approved by HMRC. He receives a pension allowance of 20% of salary and some or all of this allowance can  
be used in relation to his membership of the BHPS, to the extent that it remains beneficial in light of new pension legislation.  
The balance is paid as a non-bonusable and non-pensionable salary supplement.
Jonathan Hill is a member of the Bovis Homes Group Personal Pension Plan (GPP ). The Plan is a contracted-in defined 
contribution arrangement. The Company's contribution for Jonathan Hill is 15% of his base salary.
There are no special early retirement or early termination provisions for executive directors, except as noted in the exit payments 
policy. Any new appointments would include eligibility for membership of the GPP, unless the appointee was already a member of 
the BHPS.

Shareholding guidelines
Guidelines have been approved for executive directors in respect of ownership of Bovis Homes' shares. The Board expects executive 
directors benefiting from the exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards or exercise of share options to retain 100% of the net value 
derived from the exercise as shares, after settling all costs and income tax due, until such time as the executive director holds shares with an 
historic cost equal to their basic annual salary. The executive directors' progress in achieving the guidelines is shown below.

Implementation of remuneration policy for the year ending 31 December 2014
Changes in the way that remuneration policy will be implemented in 2014 versus 2013 include base salary increases for the executive 
directors and an increase in the maximum annual award under the LTIP from 100% to 150% of base salary for the CEO and from 100% to 
125% of base salary for the GFD.
Executive directors' base salaries
The salaries of the executive directors with effect from 1 January 2014 are as follows:
 
Executive directors
 
Position
 
2014 base salary
% increase  
from 2013
David Ritchie CEO  465,000 3.33%
Jonathan Hill GFD  280,000 3.70%
The increase for the CEO, David Ritchie, of 3.33% is warranted given his continued outstanding leadership and contribution to the Group. 
This is reflected in the strong profit improvement delivered by the Company in 2013 and the excellent positioning of the Group for 2014, 
following a difficult period for the house building industry.
The Committee decided that given his performance, increased experience and strong contribution to the Group, an increase of 3.70% 
would be made to the salary of Jonathan Hill, the GFD.
An allowance of just over 3% of salary roll was provided for general staff increases.
Benefits will continue on the same basis as for 2013.

Remuneration report
Approach to annual bonus
Following the annual review, it was concluded that the annual bonus scheme continues to measure key elements of performance 
that are in line with the Company's stated strategy over the shorter term and so no changes are to be made for 2014 in terms of 
either performance measures or quantum. The Committee has decided not to disclose the detail of performance targets in advance 
as they are considered commercially sensitive, being indicative performance indicators closely linked to the Group's growth strategy.  
It is not intended to provide this information in future years. However, the 2014 performance measures are described below.
Measure (%weighting) Rationale / link to strategy Profit before tax (50%)
Financial measures (90%)
Profit before tax Explicitly ties reward to financial performance.
Challenges management to deliver and out-perform profit target.
50%
Cash flow Demands tight cash management in the operational running of  
the business. 
A strong balance sheet is a key determinant of the Company's ability 
to invest for the future, and thus deliver future profitability.
15%
ROIC Aligns the way the business is managed with the key interest of 
shareholders, being the return achieved on invested capital.
25% 
Non-financial measures (10%)
Customer service Quality of service is key to reputation and future success, both in 
terms of customer demand and achieved selling prices.
10%
Total opportunity 100%
Approach for Long Term Incentive Plan awards
The key features of the long term incentive arrangements remain the same as those for 2013 with the exception of:
   Award sizes increased to 150% of salary for the CEO and 125% of salary for the GFD (subject to 2014 AGM approval).
Performance conditions
Total Shareholder Return (one-third of total award)
The target for maximum vesting of outperformance of the index by 10% per annum is historically equal to at least upper quartile 
performance, and is thus deemed appropriately stretching. TSR will be calculated using a three month averaging period at the start 
and end of the period to smooth the impact of share price volatility on vesting.
Performance measurement Target performance Maximum performance
TSR Equal to the median of the Index Median plus 10% per annum
The constituents of the TSR index to be used for the 2014 awards have been increased by the addition of Crest Nicholson Holdings plc.

Earnings per share (one-third of total award)
The Committee adopted cumulative EPS targets for the 2014 awards. When setting minimum and maximum absolute EPS targets for the 
2014 awards, the Committee considered data providing visibility over the three year performance period, including internal forecasts and 
analysts' forecasts, and set absolute minimum and maximum EPS targets of 230p and 280p per share to be measured on a cumulative basis 
over the three year performance period. Where EPS falls below the minimum, none of the shares in the award judged by reference to EPS 
can be realised.

When setting minimum and maximum absolute ROCE targets for the 2014 awards, the Committee again considered data providing visibility 
over the three year performance period, including internal forecasts and analysts' forecasts. The Committee set absolute minimum and 
maximum ROCE targets for the 2014 awards of 17.0% and 20.0%, to be measured in the third year of the performance period (2016).
