Information not s ubject to Audit
The Company is committed to the principles of good governance relating to Directors' remuneration.
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee comprises Ronnie Hanna (Chairman) and Caroline Cook. The Committee meets at least  
twice a year and more often if required.
It reviews the performance of the Executive Directors and sets the scale and structure of their remuneration on the  
basis of their service agreements with due regard to the interests of shareholders and the performance of the Group.  
The Remuneration Committee also makes recommendations to the Board concerning employee incentives, including the 
allocation of share options and LTIP awards to Directors and employees. Independent advisers are engaged to advise  
the Committee as required. 
Directors of the Group are not permitted to participate in discussions or decisions of the Committee concerning their  
own remuneration.
Remuneration Policy
The Remuneration Committee aims to provide overall packages of terms and conditions that are competitive in the market 
and will attract, retain and motivate high quality individuals capable of achieving the Group's objectives. The Remuneration 
Committee believes that such packages should contain significant performance related elements and that these elements 
should be designed to align the interests of employees with those of the shareholders. Performance targets have been  
put in place and include indicators such as successful investment, innovation, staff development and achievement of  
regulatory requirements.
The Remuneration Committee reviews annually the existing remuneration of the Executive Directors, making comparisons  
with peer companies of a similar size and complexity in the independent oil exploration and production industry in the UK  
and overseas.
The main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors are:
  Basic Salary.

Directors' s hare Options & Long Term Incentive Plan 
Share Options
No Directors had any interest in share options at 30 June 2008 or at any point during the financial year.
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP is designed to reward the Executive Directors and certain senior executives in line with the future performance  
of the Company. Benefits will only be delivered if performance targets are met.
The LTIP was approved by shareholders at the EGM held on 6 December 2006.
The LTIP entitles the holder to receive a specific number of shares in the Company for no consideration, with the release 
of those shares being dependent upon the achievement of certain Performance Conditions by the Company over the 
Performance Period. Performance Conditions are determined by the Remuneration Committee. Performance Conditions  
for Awards currently in issue are predicated upon a Total Shareholder Return ( TSR') target against the TSR of companies  
in a comparator group over the relevant performance period. 
In addition, prior to the Award Vesting, the Remuneration Committee is required to be satisfied that there has been a 
satisfactory and sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company over the Performance Period.
