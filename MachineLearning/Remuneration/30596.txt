DIRECTORS' REMun ERA TIOn REPORT
INFORMATION NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT
The Group is not required to disclose the following information but has chosen to do so.
The Company is committed to the principles of good governance relating to Directors' remuneration.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
The Remuneration Committee comprises Ronnie Hanna (Chairman), Caroline Cook, Tim Sullivan and Philip Tracy. All are Non-Executive Directors. The Committee 
meets at least twice a year and more often if required.
The Committee reviews the performance of the Executive Directors and sets the scale and structure of their remuneration on the basis of their service agreements 
with due regard to the interests of shareholders and the performance of the Group. The Remuneration Committee also makes recommendations to the Board 
concerning employee incentives, including the allocation of awards under the long term incentive plan (LTIP) to Directors and senior management and share 
options to employees. Independent advisers are engaged to advise the Committee as required. 
Directors do not participate in discussions or decisions of the Committee concerning their own remuneration.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Remuneration Committee aims to provide overall packages of terms and conditions that are competitive in the market and will attract, retain and motivate 
high quality individuals capable of achieving the Group's objectives. The Remuneration Committee believes that such packages should contain significant 
performance related elements and that these elements should be designed to align the interests of employees with shareholders. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews annually the existing remuneration of the Executive Directors, making comparisons with peer companies of a similar size 
and complexity in the independent oil exploration and production industry in the UK and overseas.
The main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors are:
   Basic salary
   Benefits in kind
   Performance related bonus
   LTIP awards

DIRECTORS' SHARE OPTIONS AND LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 
Share options
No Directors had any interest in share options at 30 June 201 1 or at any point during the financial year.
Long term incentive plan 
The LTIP is designed to reward the Executive Directors and certain senior executives in line with the future performance of the Company. Benefits will only be 
delivered if performance targets are met.
The LTIP was approved by shareholders at the EGM held on 6 December 2006.
The LTIP entitles the holder to receive a specific number of shares in the Company for no consideration, with the release of those shares being dependent upon  
the achievement of certain performance conditions by the Company over the performance period. Performance conditions are determined by the Remuneration 
Committee. Performance conditions for awards currently in issue are predicated upon a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) target against the TSR of companies in  
a comparator group over the relevant performance period. 
In addition, prior to any award vesting under the LTIP , the Remuneration Committee is required to be satisfied that there has been a satisfactory and sustained 
improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company over the performance period.
Further details of the LTIP and how it operates can be found on the Company's website www.bowleven.com at the following location: Investor Relations/
Governance and Directors Shares/LTIP Scheme.  32 Bowleven Annual Report and Accounts 2011
