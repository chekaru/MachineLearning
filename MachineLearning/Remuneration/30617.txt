VESTING OF AWARDS
The vesting of an award granted under the L TIP is dependent upon the achievement of performance conditions determined by the Remuneration Committee at the 
relevant grant date. The performance conditions which were applicable to the awards which vested during the year are noted below.
   Awards will vest if the total shareholder return in the Company ranks median or above when compared with the TSR of a pre-defined comparator group over 
the relevant three year performance period.
   The percentage of allocated shares that are transferred to a participant is determined by Bowleven's position in the TSR ranking list as set out below:

  Sterling Energy plc
Ascent Resources plc Equator Exploration Limited

Bowleven's performance was in the upper quartile and therefore the 2008 awards vested in full.

DILUTION - COMPLIANCE WITH ABI GUIDELINES
The Company complies with the dilution guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers. When aggregated with awards under all of the Company's other 
schemes, the Company can issue a maximum of 10% of the issued ordinary share capital (adjusted for share issuance and cancellation) in any rolling 10 year period. 
In addition, commitments to issue new shares under the LTIP may not exceed 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company (adjusted for share issuance 
and cancellation) in any rolling 10 year period.
As at 5 November 2012 a total of 1,423,571 shares (representing 0.48% of the issued share capital) have vested and been awarded to staff under the Bowleven 
company share option schemes. Options in respect of a further 6,575,870 shares (2.23%) have been granted to staff. 2,859,304 shares (0.97%) have been issued  
to Executive Directors and senior management under the LTIP with up to a further 4,452,463 shares (1.51%) subject to awards granted in respect of ongoing 
performance periods. 
SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES
In order to align the Executive Directors' interests more closely with those of shareholders, Executive Directors are required to acquire and/or retain from share 
awards vesting a minimum level of shareholding equivalent to one year's salary. All Executive Directors currently comply with this requirement. The table below  
sets out details of the aggregate cost of shares purchased by Directors and details of share awards under the LTIP retained by the Executive Directors. This table 
analyses the shareholdings of Directors as at 30 June 2012:

DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES 
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES IN RELATION TO THE GROUP AND COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with applicable UK law  
and regulations. 
UK company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The AIM Rules require the Directors to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU. The Directors have elected to prepare the Company 
financial statements on the same basis. 
UK company law also provides that the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state  
of affairs of the Company and of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these Group and Company financial statements the 
Directors are required to: 
   Select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8  Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors' and then apply them consistently; 
   Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that is relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable;
   Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the Group's financial position and financial performance; 
   State that the Group has complied with IFRS, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
   Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group's and Company's transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and of the Company and enable them to ensure that the Group's and Company's financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.  Financial Statements
We have audited the financial statements (the  financial statements') of Bowleven plc for the year ended 30 June 2012 which comprise the Group Income 
Statement, the Group and Company Statements of Comprehensive Income, the Group and Company Balance Sheets, the Group and Company Cash Flow 
Statements, the Group and Company Statements of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 27 . The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company 
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members as a body,  
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
As explained more fully in the Directors' Responsibilities Statement set out on page 4 1, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion of the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board's Ethical Standards for Auditors.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the Group's and the parent company's circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
annual report and accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In our opinion:
   the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and Parent Company's affairs as at 30 June 201 2 and of the Group's loss for the year  
then ended;
   the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union; 
   the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and as applied  
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
   the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
OPINION ON OTHER MATTER PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors' Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the  
financial statements.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
   adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches  
not visited by us; or
   the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
   certain disclosures of Directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
   we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
