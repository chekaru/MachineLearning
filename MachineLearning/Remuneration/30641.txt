Directors' remuneration report
Part 1 - Executive directors' remuneration
Dear Shareholder 
The remuneration committee places high value on the independence both of its decision-making processes and 
of the advice it receives. Throughout a sometimes challenging year, this independence has enabled the committee 
to take decisions on executive director remuneration that properly align directors' remuneration with the interests 
of shareholders while also meeting the imperative of retaining and engaging the world-class executive talent we 
are fortunate to have leading our company.
Our commitment to link pay to performance continues. In 2002, the company produced strong results in
many areas of the business, balanced by a few disappointments. As you will see, the rating for the annual bonus 
for 2002, which assesses the full breadth of performance during the year, is some 11% lower than last year,
reflecting good, but less favourable, overall performance this year. The expected award of shares under the 
Long Term Performance Plan for the period 2000-2002 is less than half last year's award. 
Our approach to policy for 2003 will continue to be as for the past several years and will be underpinned 
by regular monitoring of remuneration policies and levels at competitor companies in Europe and the USA. 
The Executive Directors' Incentive Plan, which was approved by shareholders in April 2000, continues to be
competitive and will again be used as last year. Details of this plan are explained on pages 32 and 33.
In 2003, the committee will continue to review the remuneration plans that apply to executive directors
to ensure they meet the dual needs of alignment with shareholders' interests and of the retention and 
engagement of our executives. Consistent with our well-established policy of transparency, any significant
changes we feel are warranted will be brought to shareholders for approval at a future annual general meeting.
Full details of the 2002 remuneration of executive directors and all other information about executive 
directors required under the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 are contained in the committee's
report below.
Sir Robin Nicholson
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
11 February 2003
This report sets out the company's policy on executive directors'
remuneration for 2003 and, so far as practicable, for subsequent
years. The inclusion in the report of remuneration policy in respect of
years after 2003 is required by the legislation under which this report
is prepared. 
The remuneration committee is able to state its remuneration
policy for 2003 with reasonable certainty, but is less certain that this
policy will continue without amendment in subsequent years. This is
because the committee considers that a successful remuneration
policy needs to be sufficiently flexible to take account of future
changes in BP's business environment and in remuneration practice.
Any changes in policy for years after 2003 will be described in future
directors' remuneration reports, which will continue to be subject
to shareholder approval. All statements in this report in relation to
remuneration policy for years after 2003 should be read in the light 
of this paragraph.
The directors' remuneration report this year has a new format 
that is designed to comply with requirements introduced by the
Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. The report 
covers all directors, both executive and non-executive.
The report, which is set out on pages 30 to 39, is divided into 
two parts. Each part contains a section that is subject to audit.
Executive directors' remuneration is in the first part, which was
prepared by the remuneration committee. Non-executive directors'
remuneration is in the second part, which was prepared by the
company secretary on behalf of the board.
The report has been approved by the board and signed on its
behalf by the company secretary. This report is subject to the approval
of shareholders at the annual general meeting. The remuneration committee
T asks
The committee's tasks as set out in the board governance policies are:
  To determine on behalf of the board the terms of engagement 
and remuneration of the group chief executive and the executive
directors and to report on those to the shareholders.
  To determine on behalf of the board matters of policy over 
which the company has authority relating to the establishment 
or operation of the company's pension scheme of which the
executive directors are members.
  To nominate on behalf of the board any trustees (or directors 
of corporate trustees) of such scheme.
  To monitor the policies being applied by the group chief executive
in remunerating senior executives other than executive directors.
Constitution and operation
The committee members are all non-executive directors. The
membership throughout 2002 was: Sir Robin Nicholson (chairman), 
Mr Davis, Dr Julius, Mr Knight and Sir Ian Prosser. Like other
directors, each member of the committee is subject to re-election
every three years. They have no personal financial interest, other than
as shareholders, in the committee's decisions. They have no conflicts
of interest arising from cross-directorships with the executive
directors nor from being involved in the day-to-day business of the
company. The committee met five times in the period under review.
In its constitution and operation the committee complies with 
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance. It is accountable 
to shareholders through its annual report on executive directors'
remuneration. The committee will consider the outcome of the vote
on the remuneration report, and the views of investors will be taken
into account by the committee in its future decisions.
Advice
Advice is provided to the committee by the company secretary's
office, which is independent of executive management and reports 
to the non-executive chairman. Mr Gerrit Aronson, who is an
independent consultant within the company secretary's office, was
appointed in 2000 by the committee as its secretary and special
adviser. He does not provide any other services to the group.
The committee, in consultation with Mr Aronson and the company
secretary, also appoints external professional advisers to provide
specialist advice and services on particular remuneration matters. 
This allows for a range of external independent opinion to be sourced
by the committee. This advice is then subject to an independent
review by Mr Aronson. The committee assesses the advice it
receives, applying its own judgement. Procedures to ensure the
independence of advice are subject to annual review.
During 2002, the following people provided advice or services 
on specific matters to the committee that materially assisted it 
in its consideration of matters relating to executive directors'
remuneration:
  Mr Sutherland (chairman); Lord Browne (group chief executive),
who was consulted on matters relating to the other executive
directors who report to him and on matters relating to the
performance of the company. He was not present when matters
affecting his own remuneration were considered; Mr Iain Macdonald
(group vice president, planning, performance management and
control, for the company), who provided to the committee some
of the company's calculations for the performance-related pay
which were then subject to independent verification by Ernst 
& Young as auditors; Mr Aronson; Miss Hanratty (company
secretary); and Mrs Sarah Martin (senior counsel, company
secretary's office). Only Mr Aronson among those above was
appointed by the committee.
  Towers Perrin who, during 2002, have been the committee's
principal advisers on matters of executive directors' remuneration
and who also provided some ad hoc remuneration and benefits
advice to parts of the group, mainly comprising pensions advice 
in Canada; Kepler Associates, who advised on the selection of the
shareholder return against the market performance benchmark 
for the Executive Directors' Incentive Plan and tracked BP's
performance against this benchmark (they provided a similar
service in relation to the Long Term Performance Plan for senior
executives); Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Allen & Overy and
Martin Moore, QC, all of whom provided legal advice on specific
matters to the committee and who provide ad hoc legal advice to
the group; and Ernst & Young in their capacity as auditors, who
reviewed and reported to the committee on the calculations of
BP's performance in respect of financial targets that form the
basis for performance-related pay for the executive directors, and
who also provide audit, audit-related and taxation services to the
group. All the above were appointed separately by the committee
or the secretary to the committee to provide the advice or
services that it sought, except for Kepler Associates, who were
appointed by the group chief executive and subsequently provided
information to the remuneration committee.
Policy on executive directors' remuneration
Main principles
The remuneration committee's reward policy reflects its obligation 
to align executive directors' remuneration with shareholders' interests
and to engage world-class executive talent for the benefit of the 
group. The main principles of the policy are:
  Total rewards should be set at appropriate levels to reflect 
the competitive global market in which BP operates.
  The majority of the total reward should be linked to the
achievement of demanding performance targets.
  Executive directors' incentives should be aligned with the
interests of ordinary shareholders. This is achieved through setting
performance targets that are based on measures of shareholders'
interests and through the committee's policy that each executive
director should hold a significant shareholding in the company,
currently equivalent to 5 x the director's base salary.
  The performance targets in the Executive Directors' Incentive Plan
should encompass demanding comparisons of BP's shareholder
returns and earnings with those of other companies in its own
industry and in the broader marketplace.
  The wider scene, including pay and employment conditions
elsewhere in the group, should be taken into account, especially
when determining annual salary increases.
BP 2002 Directors' remuneration report 31 32
Elements of remuneration
The executive directors' total remuneration consists of salary, annual
bonus, long-term incentives, pensions and other benefits. This reward
structure is regularly reviewed by the committee to ensure that it
is achieving its objectives. In 2003, over three-quarters of executive
directors' potential direct remuneration will again be performance-
related (see illustrative chart below). It is intended that this balance 
of elements should continue.
Salary
Each executive director receives a fixed sum payable monthly in cash.
The committee expects to review salaries later in 2003 in line with
global markets. The appropriate survey groups are defined and
analysed by external remuneration advisers.
Annual bonus
Each executive director is eligible to participate in an annual
performance-based bonus scheme. The remuneration committee
reviews and sets bonus targets and levels of eligibility annually. 
The target level is 100% of base salary (except for Lord Browne, 
for whom, as group chief executive, it is considered appropriate to
have a target of 110%). There is a stretch level of 150% of base salary
for substantially exceeding targets. Executive directors' annual bonus
awards for 2003 will again be based on a mix of demanding financial
targets and other leadership objectives, established at the beginning
of the year. In addition to business performance, they cover areas
such as people, safety, environment and organization.
Long-term incentives
Long-term incentives are provided under the Executive Directors'
Incentive Plan (EDIP), which was approved by shareholders in April
2000. It has three elements: a share element, a share option element
and a cash element. Each executive director participates in this plan.
The committee's policy, subject to unforeseen circumstances, is that
this should continue until the plan expires or is renewed in 2005. 
The committee's policy for 2003 is to continue to use only the share
element and the share option element. The committee's policy that
each executive director should hold shares equivalent to 5 x the
director's base salary is reflected in the terms of the plan.
The performance conditions in the share element and share
option element of the EDIP were selected to ensure that executive
directors' long-term remuneration under the EDIP is appropriately
balanced between elements testing BP's performance against 
that of competitors in the oil industry and elements testing BP's
performance against that of the leading global companies.
1. Share element
The share element permits the remuneration committee to grant
 performance units' to executive directors, which may result in an
award of shares (without payment by the directors) at the end of a
three-year performance period if demanding performance conditions
are met. The maximum number of shares that may be awarded for
each performance unit is two.
Shares awarded are then held in trust for three years before 
they are released to the individual. This gives the executive directors 
a six-year incentive structure, and ensures their interests are aligned
with those of shareholders.
The share element compares BP's performance against the oil and
gas sector over three years on a rolling basis. This is assessed in terms
of a three-year total shareholder return against the market (SHRAM),
return on average capital employed (ROACE) and earnings per share
growth, based on pro forma results adjusted for special items (EPS).
SHRAM is the primary measure, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the
potential total award. All calculations are reviewed by the auditors to
ensure that they meet an independent objective standard. The relative
position of the company within the comparator group determines the
number of shares awarded per performance unit.
For the 2001-2003 plan, BP's three-year SHRAM is measured
against the other oil majors: ExxonMobil, Shell, TotalFinaElf and
ChevronTexaco. Due to the reduced number of oil majors, for the
2002-2004 and 2003-2005 plans BP's three-year SHRAM is measured
against the companies in the FTSE All World Oil & Gas Index.
Companies within the index are weighted according to their market
capitalization at the beginning of each three-year period in order to
give greatest emphasis to oil majors.
The committee reviews and approves annually the performance
measures and the comparator companies. The policy for 2003 and 
for the foreseeable future is to continue with the SHRAM measure
adopted by the committee in relation to the 2002-2004 and 
2003-2005 plans.
BP's ROACE and EPS for all the plans since April 2001 are, 
and for the foreseeable future will be, measured against ExxonMobil,
Shell, TotalFinaElf and ChevronTexaco.
2. Share option element
The share option element of the EDIP is designed to reflect BP's
performance relative to a wider selection of global companies. It 
has a disclosed three-year pre-grant performance requirement that
differentiates it from traditional share option schemes. Under this
element, options may be granted to executive directors at an exercise
price no lower than the market value (as determined in accordance

Award with the plan rules) of a share at the date the option is granted.
Reflecting the pre-grant performance requirement, options vest over
three years after grant (one-third each after one, two and three years
respectively). They have a life of seven years after grant.
In accordance with the framework approved by shareholders
in 2000, it is the committee's policy to continue exercising its
judgement to decide the number of options to be granted to each
executive director, taking into account BP's total shareholder return
(TSR) compared with the TSR for the FTSE Global 100 group of
companies over the three years preceding the grant. The committee
will not grant options in any year unless the criteria for an award of
shares under the share element have been met. These methods of
calculation were chosen to enable the committee to take into account
not only the TSR position but also the underlying health of the
business and the competitive marketplace.
Following grant, the options are not subject to any performance
conditions. The remuneration committee favours this approach for 
two main reasons. First, it has the effect of treating share options as 
a reward both for past performance (because BP's ranking within a
comparator group will have been taken into account in determining
the number of shares under option) and as an incentive for future
performance (because the participant's gain under the option will
depend on share price growth after the grant under the option).
Second, BP operates internationally and the application of a
performance condition after grant is not a feature of option schemes
operated by major international companies based outside the UK.
3. Cash element
The cash element allows the remuneration committee to grant cash
rather than share-based incentives in exceptional circumstances. This
element was not used in 2002, and the committee has no present
intention to use it in 2003.
Other benefits
  Pension - executive directors are eligible to participate in the
appropriate pension schemes applying in their home countries 
as described on page 37.
  Benefits and other share schemes - executive directors are 
eligible to participate in regular employee benefit plans and in 
all-employee share schemes and savings plans applying in their
home countries. Benefits in kind are not pensionable.
  Resettlement allowance - expatriates may receive a resettlement
allowance for a limited period.
New appointees
Dr Allen, Dr Hayward and Mr Manzoni were appointed executive
directors on 1 February 2003, each on a base salary of  400,000 
per annum. They are subject to the committee's policy on executive
directors' remuneration, as described above. As such, they will be
eligible to participate in the annual bonus scheme and EDIP described
above on a similar basis to the other executive directors.
Service contracts
Policy
The committee's policy on executive directors' service contracts is 
for them to contain a maximum notice period of one year. To reflect
current market practice, Lord Browne has agreed to reduce the notice
period in his contract to one year and it has been amended to reflect
this. All executive directors' service contracts now either expire this
year or can be terminated on one year's notice.
Each service contract expires at the respective normal retirement
date of the director but is subject to earlier termination for cause
or if notice is given under the contract. 
The contracts are designed to allow for flexibility to deal with
each case on its own particular merits in accordance with the law and
policy as they have developed at the relevant time. With effect from
January 2003, the committee will include a provision in new service
contracts to allow for severance payments to be phased where
appropriate to do so. It will also consider mitigation to reduce
compensation to a departing director where appropriate to do so. 
A large proportion of each executive director's total remuneration is
linked to performance and therefore will not be payable to the extent
that the relevant targets are not met. 
Specific contracts
Lord Browne's service contract with the company is dated
11 November 1993. It can be terminated by the company or by 
Lord Browne by one year's notice. 
Dr Buchanan's service contract with the company is dated 
21 October 1998 and expires at his normal retirement date in 
June 2003. 
Mr Chase's service contract with the company is dated
30 November 1993 and expires at his normal retirement date
in May 2003.
Dr Grote's service contract with BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. 
is dated 7 August 2000. It can be terminated by that company 
or by Dr Grote by one year's notice. He is seconded to BP p.l.c. 
under a secondment agreement that is dated 7 August 2000. At
31 December 2002, this secondment agreement had an unexpired
term of five years. The secondment may be terminated by one
month's notice by either party and terminates automatically on the
termination of Dr Grote's service contract.
Mr Olver's service contract with the company is dated
31 December 1997. It can be terminated by the company or by 
Mr Olver by one year's notice. The company may also terminate 
the contract at any time with immediate effect on payment in lieu 
of notice equivalent to one year's salary or the amount of salary that
would have been paid if the contract had terminated on the expiry of
the remainder of the notice period.
There are no other provisions for compensation payable on early
termination of the above contracts. In the event of early termination
under any of the above contracts by the company other than for cause
(or under a specific termination payment provision), the relevant
director's then current salary and contractual benefits would be taken
into account in calculating any liability of the company. The principal
contractual benefits provided in addition to salary are the provision of 
a car or car allowance, pension and life insurance. Annual bonuses 
and long-term incentives are non-contractual and are dealt with in
accordance with the rules of the relevant schemes. 
Details in relation to Mr Ford's contract are included on page 37.

Information subject to audit
This graph is included to meet the new requirement to show the
growth in the value of a hypothetical  100 holding in BP p.l.c. ordinary
shares over five years relative to a broad equity market index. The
FTSE All World Oil & Gas Index was considered by the remuneration
committee to be the most relevant index for this purpose as it relates
directly to BP's sector. 
Salary
In January 2002 base salaries for executive directors were increased
by less than 10% per annum. Base salaries have recently been
increased by 5% per annum both for Dr Grote on his promotion to
chief financial officer and for Mr Olver on his promotion to deputy
group chief executive.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus awards for 2002 are based on a mix of financial
targets and leadership objectives established at the beginning of the
year. Assessment of all the targets resulted in a target performance 
of 120 points out of a maximum of 150, which is some 11% lower
than the 135 points last year. The resulting bonus awards are shown 
in the summary table above. All calculations in relation to the annual
bonus have been reviewed by the auditors.

EDIP = Executive Directors' Incentive Plan adopted by shareholders in April 2000 as described on pages 32-33. The awards are made taking into consideration the ranking of 
the company's TSR against the TSR of the FTSE Global 100 group of companies over the three-year period prior to the grant. As noted in last year's report, for directors who retire
after 1 January 2002, options that are vested at a director's retirement will now be preserved until the normal lapse date (the seventh anniversary of grant).

In keeping with the US market practice, none of the options under the BPA, NRSO and SAR is subject to performance conditions because they were granted under American
plans to the relevant individuals and the NRSO options were awarded prior to Amoco's merger with BP .

Long T erm Performance Plans (LTPPs) and share element of EDIP
Under the Long Term Performance Plans and the share element of 
the EDIP , performance units are granted at the beginning of the period
and converted into an award of shares at the end of the three-year
period, depending on performance. There is a maximum of two shares
per performance unit.
Since the adoption of the EDIP in April 2000, the executive
directors have ceased to be eligible for grants under the BP share
option plan and the LTPPs. However, they were not required to
relinquish rights under those plans that had already been granted prior
to April 2000 (including performance units under the LTPPs that have
yet to mature into share awards). 
The last of these LTPP rights under the 1999-2001 and 2000-2002
plans matured or mature into share awards in February 2002 and
2003 respectively.
For the 2000-2002 LTPP , BP's performance was assessed in 
terms of SHRAM, ROACE and EPS growth - each relative to that of
ExxonMobil, Shell, TotalFinaElf, ChevronTexaco, ENI and Repsol-YPF .
BP's SHRAM came in at sixth place among the comparator 
group, fourth place on EPS growth and first place on ROACE.
Based on a performance assessment of 80 points out of 200,
the remuneration committee expects to make awards of shares
to executive directors as highlighted in the 2000-2002 lines of the
table below.
The table also sets out information in compliance with new
legal requirements introduced under the Directors' Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002. For the purpose of these regulations,
performance units are scheme interests.

Compensation for past directors
Mr Ford's service agreement was with BP Corporation North America
Inc. (BPCNA), dated 23 June 2000. Mr Ford was seconded to BP
p.l.c. under a secondment agreement dated 23 June 2000. On his
resignation from the board of BP p.l.c. with effect from 31 March
2002, his secondment to BP p.l.c. ended and he returned to the USA.
His underlying US employment agreement with BPCNA had a two-
month notice period and was due to expire on 21 January 2004. 
His contract was terminated early by BPCNA on 1 June 2002 in
accordance with its terms. The contract terms required payment to
him by BPCNA of liquidated damages of $1,655,555, being equivalent
to $1 million per annum (pro rated for part years) for each year
between the date of severance and 21 January 2004. BPCNA also
made payments totalling $129,691 to Mr Ford in June 2002 in
accordance with its standard benefits and repatriation programme. 
Mr Ford remains eligible for a pro rata award under the 2002 annual
bonus scheme and for awards under the long-term incentive schemes
in accordance with the rules of those schemes.

2002 figures for Mr Ford are stated as at 31 March 2002, the date he left the board of BP p.l.c. He retired in June 2002 and, in accordance with his entitlements under the normal
rules of the  grandfathered' plan, he took a lump-sum distribution in August 2002 of his combined plan benefits totalling $8,485,733. 
UK directors
UK directors are members of the BP Pension Scheme. The scheme
offers Inland Revenue-approved retirement benefits based on final
salary. It is the principal section of the BP Pension Fund, the latter
being set up under trust deed. Company contributions to the fund 
are made on the advice of the actuary appointed by the trustee. 
No company contributions were made during 2002.
Scheme members' core benefits are non-contributory. They
include a pension accrual of 1/60th of basic salary for each year of
service, subject to a maximum of two-thirds of final basic salary; 
a lump-sum death-in-service benefit of 3 x salary; and a dependant's
benefit of two-thirds of the member's pension. The scheme pension 
is not integrated with state pension benefits.
Normal retirement age is 60, but scheme members who have 
30 or more years' pensionable service at age 55 can elect to retire
early without an actuarial reduction being applied to their pension.
Pensions payable from the fund are guaranteed to be increased
annually in line with changes in the Retail Prices Index, up to a
maximum of 5% a year.
Directors appointed prior to 2003 accrue pension on a non-
contributory basis at the enhanced rate of 2/60ths of their final 
salary for each year of service as executive directors (up to the 
same two-thirds limit). None of the directors is affected by the
pensionable earnings cap.
In accordance with the company's long-standing practice for
executive directors who retire from BP on or after age 55 having
accrued at least 30 years' service, Mr Chase will receive an ex-gratia
lump-sum superannuation payment from the company equal to one
year's base salary following his retirement. Lord Browne will remain
eligible for consideration for such a payment. In the case of these
individuals, all matters relating to such superannuation payments will
be considered by the remuneration committee. Any such payments
would be in addition to their pension entitlements referred to above.
None of the other executive directors is eligible for consideration 
for a superannuation payment on retirement, as the remuneration
committee decided in 1996 that appointees to the board after 
that time should cease to be eligible for consideration for such 
a payment.
US directors
US directors participate in the BP Retirement Accumulation Plan 
(US plan), which features a cash balance formula. The current design
of the US plan became effective on 1 July 2000. However, certain
former employees of Amoco and ARCO have been provided with 
a minimum (or  grandfathered') benefit equal to the benefit that 
would have accrued under the respective predecessor pension plan.
Mr Ford's pension benefit was subject to this  grandfathered'
arrangement described above, reflecting his Amoco service and
benefits.
Consistent with US tax regulations, pension benefits are provided
through a combination of tax-qualified and non-qualified benefit
restoration plans, as applicable.
The Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefit (supplemental
plan) is a non-qualified top-up arrangement that became effective 
on 1 January 2002 for US employees above a specified salary level. 
The benefit formula is 1.3% of final average earnings, which comprise
base salary and bonus in accordance with standard US practice (as
specified under the qualified arrangement) multiplied by years of
service, with an offset for benefits payable under all other BP qualified
and non-qualified pension arrangements. This benefit is unfunded and
therefore paid from corporate assets. 
Dr Grote is an eligible participant under the supplemental plan,
and his pension accrual for 2002 includes the total amount that may
become payable under all plans.  38
Dear Shareholder 
It is important for BP to attract and retain non-executive talent from around the globe to ensure that our board 
is able to discharge its stewardship obligations to the highest possible standards, especially as the workload of 
non-executive directors continues to grow. The recent Higgs Report recognizes that non-executive fees should
reflect these greater expectations in the new boardroom environment, both at formal meetings of the board and 
in the work of its committees, as governance practices evolve. All non-executive members of the BP board serve
on at least one of its permanent committees, as described in the corporate governance section on page 28. 
The remuneration of non-executive directors was last considered in 2000, with revised fee levels introduced on 
1 January 2001. During 2002, the board appointed a committee of independent non-executive directors under my
chairmanship, consisting of Dr Julius and Mr Maljers, to review the remuneration of the non-executive directors and
make recommendations for future structure and amount. This ad hoc committee is distinct from the remuneration
committee, which considers matters relating to the remuneration of the executive directors. The ad hoc committee
is not a standing committee of the board and, having undertaken the task assigned to it, it has been dissolved. 
In the course of its work, the committee received advice and material assistance from Miss Hanratty (company
secretary) and Mr Jeremy Booker (vice president corporate governance, company secretary's office). 
The ad hoc committee met on three occasions to consider in detail a range of options for the remuneration 
of non-executive directors, in the light of developing remuneration practice and the anticipated workload, tasks and
liabilities of the non-executive directors. Having considered comparative data and practice, including equivalent daily
rates for non-executives in relevant jurisdictions, the committee made a number of recommendations to the board.
These recommendations were formally adopted by the board and took effect from 1 July 2002. 
John H Bryan
Chairman, Ad Hoc Committee on Non-Executive Remuneration
11 February 2003
Part 2 - Non-executive directors' remuneration
Policy on non-executive directors' remuneration
In making recommendations for non-executive directors'
remuneration, the following policies were developed to guide
the board in its current and future decision-making. 
  Within the limits set by the shareholders from time to time,
remuneration should be sufficient to attract, motivate and retain
world-class non-executive talent.
  Remuneration of non-executive directors should be proportional 
to their contribution towards the interests of the company.
  Remuneration practice should be consistent with recognized 
best-practice standards for non-executive directors' remuneration.
  Remuneration should be in the form of cash fees, payable
monthly.
  Non-executive directors should not receive share options 
from the company.
  Non-executive directors should be encouraged to establish 
a holding in BP shares broadly related to one year's base fee, 
to be held directly or indirectly in a manner compatible with their
personal investment activities and any applicable legal and
regulatory requirements.
Elements of remuneration
In contrast to the position of executive directors' pay, in which an
increasing element is performance-related, non-executive directors'
pay comprises cash fees, paid monthly, with increments for positions
of additional responsibility, reflecting additional workload and
consequent potential liability. For all non-executive directors except
the chairman, a fixed allowance is paid for transatlantic travel
undertaken for the purpose of attending a board meeting. In addition,
non-executive directors receive reimbursement of reasonable travel
and related business expenses. No share or share option awards are
made to any non-executive director in respect of service on the board.
Non-executive directors have letters of appointment that recognize
that, subject to the Articles of Association, their service is at the
discretion of the shareholders. They submit themselves for election 
at the annual general meeting following their appointment and
subsequently at intervals of no more than three years. Non-executive directors' annual fee structure
The Articles provide that the remuneration paid to non-executive
directors is determined by the board within limits set by shareholders.
Fees payable to non-executive directors were reviewed during 2002.
New and increased fees based on a comparable structure were
approved by the board as from 1 July 2002. All fees are fixed and 
paid in pounds sterling. For conformity these are also reported in 
US dollars.

Amoco Non-Employee Directors' Restricted Stock Plan
Non-executive directors of Amoco Corporation were allocated
restricted stock in the Amoco Non-Employee Directors' Restricted 
Stock Plan by way of remuneration for their service on the board 
of Amoco Corporation prior to its merger with BP in 1998. On merger,
interests in Amoco shares in the plan were converted into interests 
in BP ADSs. Under the terms of the plan, the restricted stock will vest
upon the retirement of the non-executive director at age 70 or upon
earlier retirement at the discretion of the board. Since the merger, 
no further entitlements have accrued to any director under the plan.
These residual interests require disclosure under the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 as interests in a long-term
incentive scheme:

For the purposes of the regulations, the date on which the director reaches age 70

may waive the restrictions.
Superannuation gratuities
In accordance with BP's long-standing practice, non-executive
directors who retire from the board after at least six years' service
are, at the time of their retirement, eligible for consideration for a
superannuation gratuity. The board is authorized to make such
payments under the company's Articles. The amount of the payment
is determined at the board's discretion, having regard to the director's
period of service as a director and other relevant factors. The board
did not make any payment to Sir Robert Wilson, the only non-executive
director retiring in 2002, in view of his limited length of service.
On the recommendation of the ad hoc committee on 
non-executive remuneration, during 2002 the board revised 
its policy with respect to such payments so that (i) non-executive
directors appointed to the board after 1 July 2002 would not be
eligible for consideration for such a payment, and (ii) non-executive
directors in service at 1 July 2002 would remain eligible for
consideration for a payment, but service after that date would not 
be taken into account by the board in considering the amount of 
any payment. 
This directors' remuneration report was approved by the board 
and signed on its behalf by Miss Hanratty, company secretary,
on 11 February 2003.
