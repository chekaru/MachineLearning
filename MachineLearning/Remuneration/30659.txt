 106 BP Annual Report and Accounts 2003
Directors' remuneration report
The directors' remuneration report covers all directors, both executive and
non-executive, and is set out on pages 106-115.
It is divided into two parts. Executive directors' remuneration is in the
first part, which was prepared by the remuneration committee. 
Non-executive directors' remuneration is in the second part, which 
was prepared by the company secretary on behalf of the board.
The report has been approved by the board and signed on its behalf 
by the company secretary. This report is subject to the approval of
shareholders at the annual general meeting (AGM).
Part 1 - Executive directors' remuneration
Dear Shareholder 
The remuneration committee's well-defined policy of relating pay to the performance of the company continues to be
central in determining the remuneration of the executive directors. As is commented on elsewhere in BP Annual Report
and Accounts 2003, the company produced strong financial results in 2003 as well as excellent progress on the
implementation of the company's strategic plans. 
The outcome of the committee's assessment for 2003 has therefore been an increase in the performance-related annual
bonus and share element of the Executive Directors' Incentive Plan, compared with the reductions in 2002. Share option
grants, made in February 2003, were maintained at the same level as 2002. Salaries, other than for promotions, were
increased by up to 5% mid-year to maintain our competitive position. Further details on the above are set out in the
committee's report.
The independent process and advice the committee utilizes continue to give us confidence in our policy and its
application. We also value our dialogue with major shareholders. During 2004, we will be conducting a comprehensive
review of our plans and policies with an expectation of bringing new long-term plans to shareholders for approval in 2005
when our current Executive Directors' Incentive Plan expires.
I am confident that our approach will continue to align executive directors' remuneration with the interests of
shareholders as well as retain and engage the world-class team of individuals we have leading the company.
Sir Robin Nicholson
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
9 February 2004
The remuneration committee
Tasks
The committee's tasks as set out in the board governance policies are:
 To determine on behalf of the board the terms of engagement and
remuneration of the group chief executive and the executive directors
and to report on those to the shareholders.
 To determine on behalf of the board matters of policy over which the
company has authority relating to the establishment or operation of 
the company's pension scheme of which the executive directors 
are members.
 To nominate on behalf of the board any trustees (or directors of
corporate trustees) of such scheme.
 To monitor the policies being applied by the group chief executive 
in remunerating senior executives other than executive directors.
Constitution and operation
The committee members are all non-executive directors. The membership
throughout 2003 was: Sir Robin Nicholson (chairman), Mr Davis, Dr Julius,
Mr Knight and Sir Ian Prosser. Currently, each member is subject to 
re-election every three years; however, annual re-election is proposed 
from 2005. The board considers all committee members to be 
independent (see pages 103-104). They have no personal financial 
interest, other than as shareholders, in the committee's decisions. They
have no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships with the
executive directors nor from being involved in the day-to-day business 
of the company. The committee met six times in the period under review.
There was a full attendance record, except that Sir Ian and Mr Davis were
each unable to attend one meeting. Mr Sutherland, as chairman of the
board, also attended committee meetings.
The committee is accountable to shareholders through its annual 
report on executive directors' remuneration. It will consider the outcome 
of the vote at the AGM on the remuneration report, and the views of
investors will be taken into account by the committee in its future
decisions. The committee also values its dialogue with major shareholders
on remuneration matters. 107
Advice
Advice is provided to the committee by the company secretary's office,
which is independent of executive management and reports to the 
non-executive chairman. Mr Aronson, who is an independent consultant
within the company secretary's office, was appointed in 2000 by the
committee as its secretary and special adviser. He does not provide
any other services to the group. Advice was also received in 2003 from
Mr Jackson (company secretary), Miss Hanratty (former company
secretary) and Mrs Martin (senior counsel, company secretary's office).
The committee, in consultation with Mr Aronson and the company
secretary, also appoints external professional advisers to provide specialist
advice and services on particular remuneration matters. This allows for a
range of external independent opinion to be sourced by the committee.
This advice is then subject to an independent review by Mr Aronson. The
committee assesses this advice, applying its own judgement. Procedures
to ensure the independence of advice are subject to annual review. 
The committee appointed Towers Perrin as its principal external adviser
during 2003 on matters of executive directors' remuneration. Towers Perrin
also provided some limited ad hoc remuneration and benefits advice to
parts of the group, mainly comprising pensions advice in Canada.
Lord Browne (group chief executive) was consulted on matters relating
to the other executive directors who report to him and, together with 
Dr Allen (group chief of staff), on matters relating to the performance 
of the company. Neither was present when matters affecting his own
remuneration were considered.
Policy on executive directors' remuneration
Main principles
The remuneration committee's reward policy reflects its aim to align
executive directors' remuneration with shareholders' interests and to
engage world-class executive talent for the benefit of the group. The 
main principles of the policy are:
 Total rewards should be set at appropriate levels to reflect the
competitive global market in which BP operates.
 The majority of the total reward should be linked to the achievement 
of demanding performance targets.
 Executive directors' incentives should be aligned with the interests
of ordinary shareholders. This is achieved through setting performance
targets that take account of measures of shareholders' interests and
through the committee's policy that each executive director should hold
a significant shareholding in the company, equivalent in value to 5 x the
director's base salary.
 The performance targets in the Executive Directors' Incentive Plan
should encompass demanding comparisons of BP's shareholder returns
and earnings with those of other companies in its own industry and in
the broader marketplace.
 The wider scene, including pay and employment conditions elsewhere 
in the group, should be taken into account, especially when determining
annual salary increases.
The company's existing policy on executive directors' remuneration will
remain in place for 2004. The committee is conducting a comprehensive
review of its policies in the course of 2004 prior to the expiry of the current
Executive Directors' Incentive Plan in April 2005. This review will take into
account changes in BP's business environment and its strategy. New
policies will be described in the next remuneration report for shareholder
approval and specific shareholder authorization will be sought for any new
long-term share incentive plans. All statements in this report in relation to
remuneration policy for years after 2004 should be read in this light.
Elements of remuneration
The executive directors' total remuneration consists of salary, annual 
bonus, long-term incentives, pensions and other benefits. This reward
structure is regularly reviewed by the committee to ensure that it is
achieving its objectives. In 2004, over three-quarters of executive 
directors' potential direct remuneration will again be performance-related
(see illustrative chart below). 
This chart reflects on-target values for annual bonus and share element,
and a Black Scholes value for the share option element.
Salary
Each executive director receives a fixed sum payable monthly in cash. 
The committee expects to review salaries in 2004 in line with global
markets. In doing so the committee considers appropriate comparator
groups in both Europe and the US, which are defined and analysed by
external remuneration advisers engaged independently by the committee.
Annual bonus
Each executive director is eligible to participate in an annual performance-
based bonus scheme. The remuneration committee reviews and sets
bonus targets and levels of eligibility annually. 
The target level is 100% of base salary (except for Lord Browne, 
for whom, as group chief executive, it is considered appropriate to have 
a target of 110%). There is a stretch level of 150% of base salary for
substantially exceeding targets. Outstanding performance may be
recognized by bonus payments in excess of the stretch level at the
discretion of the remuneration committee. Executive directors' annual
bonus awards for 2004 will be based on a mix of demanding financial
targets relating to the company's annual plan and leadership objectives
established at the beginning of the year. In addition to stretching
milestones and long-run metrics to track the enactment of strategy, 
they include areas such as people, safety, environment and organization.
Long-term incentives
Long-term incentives are provided under the Executive Directors' Incentive
Plan (EDIP), which was approved by shareholders in April 2000. It has three
elements: a share element, a share option element and a cash element.
Each executive director participates in this plan. The committee's policy,
subject to unforeseen circumstances, is that this should continue until the
plan expires or is renewed in April 2005. 
The performance conditions in the share element and share option
element of the EDIP were selected to ensure that executive directors'
long-term remuneration under the EDIP is appropriately balanced between
elements testing BP's performance against that of competitors in the oil
industry and elements testing BP's performance against that of leading
global companies.

On-target remuneration elements 108 BP Annual Report and Accounts 2003
The committee's policy is that each executive director should hold
shares equivalent in value to 5 x the director's base salary within five 
years of being appointed an executive director. As is reflected in the table
of Directors' interests on page 105, Lord Browne, Mr Olver and Dr Grote
all have holdings in excess of the guidelines. The recent appointees are
expected to attain this level within five years of their appointments. This
policy is reflected in the terms of the EDIP , as shares awarded under the
share element will only be released at the end of the three-year retention
period (as described below) if the minimum shareholding guidelines have
been met.
1. Share element
The share element permits the remuneration committee to grant
 performance units' to executive directors. These are notional units 
that give the directors the right to be considered for an award of shares
(without payment by the directors) at the end of a three-year performance
period, if demanding performance conditions are met. The committee
determines the number of units to be awarded each year. The maximum
value that may be granted in any one year will not normally exceed twice
the base salary. The maximum number of shares that may be awarded for
each performance unit is two.
Shares awarded are then held in trust for three years before they are
released to the individual. This gives the executive directors a six-year
incentive structure, and is designed to ensure that their interests are
aligned with those of shareholders. 
The share element compares BP's performance against the oil and gas
sector over three years on a rolling basis. This is assessed in terms of a
three-year total shareholder return against the market (SHRAM), return on
average capital employed (ROACE) and earnings per share growth, based
on pro forma results adjusted for special items (EPS). SHRAM is the
primary measure, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the potential total
award. All calculations are reviewed by the auditors to ensure that they
meet an independent objective standard. The relative position of the
company within the comparator group determines the number of shares
awarded per performance unit.
For the 2001-2003 plan, BP's three-year SHRAM was measured against
the other oil majors: ExxonMobil, Shell, TotalFinaElf, ChevronTexaco, 
ENI and Repsol. Owing to the reduced number of oil majors, for the
2002-2004, 2003-2005 and 2004-2006 plans BP's three-year SHRAM is
measured against the companies in the FTSE All World Oil & Gas Index.
Companies within the index are weighted according to their market
capitalization at the beginning of each three-year period in order to give
greatest emphasis to oil majors.
The committee reviews and approves annually the performance
measures and the comparator companies. The policy for the 2004-2006
plan is to continue with the SHRAM measure adopted by the committee 
in relation to the 2002-2004 and 2003-2005 plans.
BP's ROACE and EPS for all the plans since 2002 are measured against
ExxonMobil, Shell, TotalFinaElf and ChevronTexaco.

Timeline for 2004-2006 EDIP share element
2. Share option element
The share option element of the EDIP is designed to reflect BP's
performance relative to a wider selection of global companies. It has a
disclosed three-year pre-grant performance requirement that differentiates 
it from traditional share option schemes. Under this element, options may
be granted to executive directors at an exercise price no lower than the
market value (as determined in accordance with the plan rules) of a share
at the date the option is granted. Reflecting the pre-grant performance
requirement, options vest over three years after grant (one-third each 
after one, two and three years respectively). They have a life of seven 
years after grant.
In accordance with the framework approved by shareholders in 2000, 
it is the committee's policy to continue to exercise its judgement in 2004
to decide the number of options to be granted to each executive director,
taking into account BP's total shareholder return (TSR) compared with the
TSR for the FTSE Global 100 group of companies over the three years
preceding the grant. The committee will not grant options in any year
unless the criteria for an award of shares under the share element have
been met. These methods of calculation were chosen to enable the
committee to take into account not only the TSR position but also the
underlying health of the business and the competitive marketplace. 
The value of the grants is designed to reflect global market practice 
for executive pay. Following grant, the options are not subject to any
performance conditions. The remuneration committee has favoured 
this approach for two main reasons. First, it has the effect of treating 
share options as a reward both for past performance (because BP's 
ranking within a comparator group will have been taken into account 
in determining the number of shares under option) and as an incentive for
future performance (because the participant's gain under the option will
depend on share price growth after the grant under the option). Second,
BP operates internationally and the application of a performance condition
after grant has not been a feature of option schemes operated by major
international companies based outside the UK. The use of options and 
the types of conditions to be attached to them will be considered by the
committee as part of the more general review that is being conducted 
prior to the expiry of the current plan in 2005.
3. Cash element
The cash element allows the remuneration committee to grant cash 
rather than share-based incentives in exceptional circumstances. This
element was not used in 2003 and the committee has no present 
intention to use it in 2004.
Pensions
Executive directors are eligible to participate in the appropriate pension
schemes applying in their home countries. 
UK directors
UK directors are members of the BP Pension Scheme. The scheme 
offers Inland Revenue-approved retirement benefits based on final
salary. The BP pension scheme forms the principal section of the BP
Pension Fund, which has been set up under a trust deed. Company
contributions to the fund are made on the advice of the actuary appointed
by the trustee.
Scheme members' core benefits are non-contributory. They include a
pension accrual of 1/60th of basic salary for each year of service, subject 
to a maximum of two-thirds of final basic salary; and a dependant's 
benefit of two-thirds of the member's pension. Bonuses are not
pensionable for UK directors. The scheme pension is not integrated 
with state pension benefits. 109
Normal retirement age is 60, but scheme members who have 30 or
more years' pensionable service at age 55 can elect to retire early without
an actuarial reduction being applied to their pension.
Pensions payable from the fund are guaranteed to be increased 
annually in line with changes in the Retail Prices Index, up to a maximum
of 5% a year.
Directors appointed prior to 2003 accrue pension on a non-contributory
basis at the enhanced rate of 2/60ths of their final salary for each year of
service as executive directors (up to the same two-thirds limit). None of
the directors is affected by the pensionable earnings cap.
In accordance with the company's long-standing practice for executive
directors who retire from BP on or after age 55 having accrued at least 
30 years' service, Mr Chase received from the company in 2003 an 
ex-gratia lump-sum superannuation payment equal to one year's base
salary following his retirement. Lord Browne remains eligible for
consideration for such a payment. In the case of these individuals, all
matters relating to such superannuation payments are considered by 
the remuneration committee. Any such payments are additional to their
pension entitlements referred to above. No other executive director is
eligible for consideration for a superannuation payment on retirement, 
as the remuneration committee decided in 1996 that appointees to the
board after that time should cease to be eligible for consideration for 
such a payment. 
The UK government has recently announced important proposals on
pensions, the impact of which will be reviewed by the committee in 2004. 
US director
Dr Grote as a US director participates in the US BP Retirement
Accumulation Plan (US plan), which features a cash balance formula. 
The current design of the US plan became effective on 1 July 2000. 
Consistent with US tax regulations, pension benefits are provided
through a combination of tax-qualified and non-qualified benefit restoration
plans, as applicable.
The Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefit (supplemental plan) is a
non-qualified top-up arrangement that became effective on 1 January 2002
for US employees above a specified salary level. 
The benefit formula is 1.3% of final average earnings, which comprise
base salary and bonus in accordance with standard US practice (as
specified under the qualified arrangement) multiplied by years of service,
with an offset for benefits payable under all other BP qualified and non-
qualified pension arrangements. This benefit is unfunded and therefore 
paid from corporate assets. 
Dr Grote is an eligible participant under the supplemental plan, and his
pension accrual for 2003 includes the total amount that may become
payable under all plans.
Other benefits
 Benefits and other share schemes: Executive directors are eligible to
participate in regular employee benefit plans and in all-employee share
schemes and savings plans applying in their home countries. Benefits 
in kind are not pensionable.
 Resettlement allowance: Expatriates may receive a resettlement
allowance for a limited period. 
Service contracts
Policy
The committee's policy on executive directors' service contracts is for
them to contain a maximum notice period of one year. This policy has
now been fully implemented.
Since January 2003, the committee has included a provision in 
new service contracts to allow for severance payments to be phased
where appropriate to do so. It will also consider mitigation to reduce
compensation to a departing director where appropriate to do so. A large
proportion of each executive director's total remuneration is linked to
performance and therefore will not be payable to the extent that the
relevant targets are not met.

Director leaving the board in 2003 
R F Chase 30 November 1993
All service contracts expire at normal retirement date and have a notice
period of one year. 
The service contracts of Mr Olver, Dr Allen, Dr Hayward and Mr Manzoni
may also be terminated by the company at any time with immediate effect
on payment in lieu of notice equivalent to one year's salary or the amount
of salary that would have been paid if the contract had terminated on the
expiry of the remainder of the notice period. 
Dr Grote's service contract is with BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. He is
seconded to BP p.l.c. under a secondment agreement dated 7 August 2000.
At 31 December 2003, this secondment agreement had an unexpired term
of four years. The secondment may be terminated by one month's notice
by either party and terminates automatically on the termination of 
Dr Grote's service contract. 
There are no other provisions for compensation payable on early
termination of the above contracts. In the event of early termination under
any of the above contracts by the company other than for cause (or under
a specific termination payment provision), the relevant director's then
current salary and benefits would be taken into account in calculating 
any liability of the company.

Salary
Base salaries for Lord Browne, Mr Olver and Dr Grote were increased 
by 5% per annum with effect from 1 July 2003, following a review of
appropriate comparator groups. Apart from the 5% promotional increases
for Mr Olver and Dr Grote on their appointments to deputy group chief
executive and chief financial officer respectively, the three directors had
received no salary increases since January 2002. Dr Allen, Dr Hayward and
Mr Manzoni have received no salary increases since their appointments 
to the board in February 2003.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus awards for 2003 are based on a mix of financial targets
and leadership objectives established at the beginning of the year.
Assessment of all the results produced an award of around 85% of stretch
level (stretch level is 150% of base salary). All calculations in relation to 
the annual bonus have been reviewed by the auditors.

On 21 July 2003, Mr Chase was appointed as a BP-nominated director
of TNK-BP Limited, a joint-venture company owned 50% by BP . During
2003, he received emoluments of $120,000 from TNK-BP Limited. 
Long-term awards for both former directors are in accordance with
scheme rules as outlined in the table on page 112.

Following Dr Buchanan's retirement from the BP p.l.c. board on 
21 November 2002, he remained as an employee until his normal
retirement date of 8 June 2003. During that period he received a 
pro rata normal salary of  227,000 and a pro rata bonus of  289,425. 
Following Mr Chase's retirement in May 2003, he was engaged as 
a consultant to BP in relation to the TNK-BP transaction. Under the 112 BP Annual Report and Accounts 2003
Long T erm Performance Plans (LTPPs) and share element of EDIP
Under the Long Term Performance Plans and the share element of the
EDIP , performance units are granted at the beginning of the period and
converted into an award of shares at the end of the three-year period,
depending on performance. There is a maximum of two shares per
performance unit.
Since the adoption of the EDIP in April 2000, the executive directors have
ceased to be eligible for grants under the BP share option plan and the
LTPPs. However, they are not required to relinquish rights under those plans
that had already been granted prior to their appointments as executive
directors (including performance units under the LTPPs that have yet to
mature into share awards). Dr Allen, Dr Hayward and Mr Manzoni therefore
have rights under the 2000-2002, 2001-2003 and 2002-2004 LTPPs.
For the 2001-2003 share element of the EDIP and the LTPP , BP's
performance was assessed in terms of SHRAM, ROACE and EPS growth 
- each relative to that of ExxonMobil, Shell, TotalFinaElf, ChevronTexaco, 
ENI and Repsol.
BP's SHRAM came in at sixth place among the comparator group, 
fourth place on EPS growth and first place on ROACE.
Based on a performance assessment of 85 points out of 200, the
remuneration committee expects to make awards of shares to executive
directors as highlighted in the 2001-2003 lines of the table below.

For the performance period 2000-2002, performance units were granted under the LTPPs. Dr Allen, Dr Hayward and Mr Manzoni also continue to have units granted under 
the 2001-2003 and 2002-2004 LTPPs which were granted prior to their appointments as executive directors. All other units were granted under the EDIP as explained on 
pages 107-108. BP's performance is assessed in terms of a three-year SHRAM against the oil majors. For 1998-2000 this included ExxonMobil, Shell, TotalFinaElf,
ChevronTexaco; for 2000-2002 and 2001-2003 this included ExxonMobil, Shell, TotalFinaElf, ChevronTexaco, ENI, Repsol; for 2002-2004 and 2003-2005 it is measured against 
the FTSE All World Oil & Gas Index. For the 2000-2002, 2001-2003 and 2002-2004 plans, performance is also assessed in terms of ROACE and EPS growth. For 2000-2002 
and 2001-2003, they are measured against ExxonMobil, Shell, TotalFinaElf, ChevronTexaco, ENI, Repsol and for 2002-2004 and 2003-2005 against ExxonMobil, Shell, TotalFinaElf,
ChevronTexaco. Each performance period ends on 31 December of the third year.

114 BP Annual Report and Accounts 2003
Part 2 - Non-executive directors' remuneration
Policy on non-executive directors' remuneration
The board sets the level of remuneration for all non-executive directors
within the limit approved from time to time by shareholders. In line with
BP's governance policies, the remuneration of the chairman is set by the
board rather than the remuneration committee, since the performance 
of the chairman is a matter for the board as a whole rather than any
one committee. 
The board has adopted the following policies to guide its current 
and future decision-making with regard to non-executive directors'
remuneration. 
 Within the limits set by the shareholders from time to time,
remuneration should be sufficient to attract, motivate and retain 
world-class non-executive talent. 
 Remuneration of non-executive directors is set by the board and 
should be proportional to their contribution towards the interests 
of the company.
 Remuneration practice should be consistent with recognized best-
practice standards for non-executive directors' remuneration.
 Remuneration should be in the form of cash fees, payable monthly.
  Non-executive directors should not receive share options from the
company. 
  Non-executive directors should be encouraged to establish a holding
in BP shares broadly related to one year's base fee, to be held directly 
or indirectly in a manner compatible with their personal investment
activities, and any applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Elements of remuneration
Non-executive directors' pay comprises cash fees, paid monthly, with
increments for positions of additional responsibility, reflecting additional
workload and consequent potential liability. For all non-executive directors
except the chairman, a fixed sum allowance is paid for transatlantic travel
undertaken for the purpose of attending a board or board committee
meeting. In addition, non-executive directors receive reimbursement
of reasonable travel and related business expenses. No share or share
option awards are made to any non-executive director in respect of service
on the board. 
Letters of appointment
Non-executive directors have letters of appointment, which recognize 
that, subject to the Articles of Association, their service is at the discretion
of the shareholders. At the 2004 annual general meeting, shareholders will
be asked to approve an amendment to the Articles so that all directors will
stand for re-election annually, rather than the current practice of standing
for re-election at the first meeting following their appointment and
subsequently at intervals of no more than three years. 
Long-term incentives (residual)
The table on page 115 sets out the residual entitlements of non-executive
directors who were formerly non-executive directors of Amoco Corporation
under the Amoco Non-Employee Directors' Restricted Stock Plan.

c

a
The chairman is not eligible for committee chairmanship fees or transatlantic
attendance allowance but has the use of a fully maintained office and a chauffeured
car for company business.
b
The deputy chairman receives a  20,000 increment on top of the standard board fee.
In addition, the deputy chairman is eligible for committee chairmanship fees and the
transatlantic attendance allowance. The deputy chairman is currently chairman of the
audit committee. 
c
This allowance is payable to non-executive directors undertaking transatlantic travel 
for the purpose of attending a board meeting or board committee meeting.
Non-executive directors' annual fee structure 
The fees paid to non-executive directors are set by the board within the
limits set by shareholders in accordance with the Articles. The company
will be asked to approve an increase in this limit (fixed since 1998) at the
2004 AGM. All fees are fixed and paid in pounds sterling. Fees payable to
non-executive directors were last reviewed during 2002. 115
Amoco Non-Employee Directors' Restricted Stock Plan
Non-executive directors of Amoco Corporation were allocated restricted
stock in the Amoco Non-Employee Directors' Restricted Stock Plan by way
of remuneration for their service on the board of Amoco Corporation prior
to its merger with BP in 1998. On merger, interests in Amoco shares in 
the plan were converted into interests in BP ADSs. Under the terms of the
plan, the restricted stock will vest upon the retirement of the non-executive
director having reached age 70 or upon earlier retirement at the discretion
of the board. Since the merger, no further entitlements have accrued to
any director under the plan. These residual interests require disclosure
under the directors' remuneration report regulations 2002 as interests 
in a long-term incentive scheme.
Superannuation gratuities
In accordance with the company's long-standing practice, non-executive
directors who retire from the board after at least six years' service 
are, at the time of their retirement, eligible for consideration for a
superannuation gratuity. The board is authorized to make such payments
under the company's Articles. The amount of the payment is determined 
at the board's discretion (having regard to the director's period of service
as a director and other relevant factors). 
In 2002, the board revised its policy with respect to such payments so
that: (i) non-executive directors appointed to the board after 1 July 2002
would not be eligible for consideration for such a payment; and (ii) while
non-executive directors in service at 1 July 2002 would remain eligible for
consideration for a payment, service after that date would not be taken
into account by the board in considering the amount of any such payment. 
The board made no superannuation gratuity payments during the year. 
This directors' remuneration report was approved by the board and signed
on its behalf by David J Jackson, company secretary, on 9 February 2004.
