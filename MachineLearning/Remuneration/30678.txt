The directors' remuneration report covers all directors, both executive
and non-executive, and is set out on pages 116-125.
It is divided into two parts. Executive directors' remuneration is in
the first part, which was prepared by the remuneration committee.
Non-executive directors' remuneration is in the second part, 
which was prepared by the company secretary on behalf of 
the board.
The report has been approved by the board and signed on its 
behalf by the company secretary. This report is subject to the 
approval of shareholders at the annual general meeting (AGM).
Part 1 - Executive directors' remuneration
Dear Shareholder 
2004 was a good year. Company results, as explained elsewhere, were excellent and the remuneration committee's priority on relating pay to
performance is reflected in the annual bonus payments commensurate with this high level of achievement. These and all other aspects of the
executive directors' remuneration during the year are set out in detail in the committee's report that follows.
The committee also undertook a comprehensive and independent review of remuneration policy for the executive directors during 2004, 
prior to seeking your approval for the renewal of the long-term incentive plan at this year's AGM (resolution 23). As part of this review, we
commissioned significant and wide-ranging academic research and sought the views of major shareholders in an effort to consider the fundamental
bases underlying our remuneration policies and practices. The depth and extensive nature of this review have meant that our policy and practices
are underpinned by a strong set of principles, which guide the committee's(deliberations. Full details of these are set out in the report.
Measures of performance lie at the heart of any performance-based system and we have, with extensive advice and considerable time,
examined different approaches. While there is no perfect measure, we believe the selected quantitative and qualitative measures are the most
appropriate for BP . Given the inherent imperfections of any measure of performance, we also see the use of our judgement as an integral part 
of the process. We recognize that our relationship with you is built on trust, and we are clear that it is important for us to be transparent in our
explanations to you of how we have reached decisions and exercised our discretion.
We have an excellent team of world-class executive directors leading the company. The remuneration decisions we have taken for 2004
appropriately reflect the high level of performance achieved during the year. The policy we have set out for the future should continue to align 
their remuneration with shareholders' interests as well as to engage them in pursuing long-term shareholder value.

The remuneration committee
Tasks  The committee's tasks are:
  To determine on behalf of the board the terms of engagement 
and remuneration of the group chief executive and the executive
directors and to report on those to the shareholders.
  To determine on behalf of the board matters of policy over which 
the company has authority relating to the establishment or operation
of the company's pension scheme of which the executive directors
are members.
  To nominate on behalf of the board any trustees (or directors of
corporate trustees) of such scheme.
  To monitor the policies being applied by the group chief executive 
in remunerating senior executives other than executive directors.
Constitution and operation The committee members are all non-
executive directors. Sir Robin Nicholson (chairman), Mr Davis, Dr Julius,
Mr Knight and Sir Ian Prosser were members of the committee
throughout the year, with Sir Tom McKillop and Mr Bryan joining them
in November 2004. Sir Robin Nicholson and Mr Knight will both be
retiring at the 2005 AGM and Dr Julius will become the committee
chairman. Each member is now subject to annual re-election as a
director of the company. The board considers all committee members 
to be independent (see page 111). They have no personal financial
interest, other than as shareholders, in the committee's decisions. 
The committee met seven times in the period under review. There 
was a full attendance record, except that Sir Ian Prosser and Mr Knight
were each unable to attend one meeting. Mr Sutherland, as chairman
of the board, has attended all committee meetings. 
The committee is accountable to shareholders through its annual
report on executive directors' remuneration. It will consider the
outcome of the vote at the AGM on the remuneration report, and 
the views of shareholders will be taken into account by the committee
in its future decisions. The committee values its dialogue with major
shareholders on remuneration matters.
Advice Advice is provided to the committee by the company
secretary's office, which is independent of executive management 
and reports to the chairman of the board. Mr Aronson, an independent
Directors' remuneration report BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004
117
consultant, is the committee's secretary and special adviser. 
Advice was also received from Mr Jackson (company secretary) 
and Mrs Martin (senior counsel, company secretary's office).
The committee also appoints external professional advisers to
provide specialist advice and services on particular remuneration
matters. The independence of advice is subject to annual review. 
In 2004, the committee consulted three independent academics,
Michael Jensen, professor emeritus of Harvard Business School, and
professors Sir Andrew Likierman and James Dow, both of London
Business School, in connection with its fundamental review of
remuneration policy. 
The committee appointed Towers Perrin as its principal external
adviser during 2004. Towers Perrin also provided limited ad hoc
remuneration and benefits advice to parts of the group, mainly
comprising pensions advice in Canada, as well as providing some
market information on pay structures. The committee also appointed
Kepler Associates to advise on performance measurement. Kepler
Associates also provided performance data and limited ad hoc advice
on performance measurement to the group.
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Martin Moore, QC, have 
provided legal advice on specific matters to the committee. 
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer also provided some legal advice,
principally overseas, to subsidiaries in the group.
Ernst & Young, in their capacity as auditors, reviewed the
calculations in respect of financial-based targets that form the 
basis of the performance-related pay for the executive directors. 
They also provided audit, audit-related and taxation services to 
the group.
Lord Browne (group chief executive) was consulted on matters
relating to the other executive directors who report to him and,
together with Dr Allen (group chief of staff), on matters relating 
to the performance of the company. Neither was present when
matters affecting his own remuneration were considered.
Policy on executive directors' remuneration
A key priority for the committee in 2004 has been its comprehensive
and independent review of all elements of remuneration policy for
executive directors prior to seeking specific shareholder approval 
for renewal of the Executive Directors' Incentive Plan, which expires 
in 2005. This wide-ranging review sought to address the fundamental
bases of the remuneration policies and plans for the executive
directors. It involved significant academic research as well as 
seeking the views of plan participants, major shareholders and
professional advisers. The committee focused on seeking to ensure
that, in determining remuneration policy, there is a clear link between
the company's purpose, the business plans and executive reward.
As part of its review, the committee developed the following key
principles to guide its policy:
  Policy for the remuneration of executive directors shall be 
determined and regularly reviewed independently of executive
management and will set the tone for the remuneration of other
senior executives.
  The remuneration structure shall support and reflect BP's stated
purpose to maximize long-term shareholder value.
  The remuneration structure shall reflect a just system of rewards 
for the participants.
  The overall quantum of all potential remuneration components 
shall be determined by the exercise of informed judgement of 
the independent remuneration committee, taking into account 
the success of BP and the competitive global market.
  The majority of the remuneration shall be linked to the achievement
of demanding performance targets that are independently set and
reflect the creation of long-term shareholder value.
  Assessment of performance shall be quantitative and qualitative 
and shall include exercise of informed judgement by the
remuneration committee within a framework that takes account 
of sector characteristics and is approved by shareholders.
  The committee shall be proactive in obtaining an understanding 
of shareholder preferences.
  Remuneration policy and practices shall be as transparent as
possible both for participants and shareholders.
Key policy decisions The committee then reviewed the existing
remuneration policies and plans against these principles and made 
the following key policy decisions:
  The overall quantum of remuneration and the general balance
between short-term and long-term elements are to be maintained.
  Salary levels will continue to be reviewed regularly by reference 
to those in Europe-based top global companies and the US oil 
and gas sector applying the committee's judgement.
  The long-term incentives framework of the existing Executive
Directors' Incentive Plan (EDIP) remains sound, although some
changes to policy and application are now appropriate. Specific
shareholder approval is being sought for renewal of the EDIP 
for a further five years.
  The share element of the EDIP will provide the long-term
performance-based component of the executive directors'
remuneration package. There is no current intention to make 
further share options grants. 
  The majority of the value previously attributed to share options 
is to be redistributed to the share element, with the remainder 
going to the annual bonus. 
  The measure of long-term performance for the share element 
will be relative total shareholder return (TSR) compared with the
other oil majors over three-year periods, with underlying relative
performance also being assessed by the committee. 
  A proportion of the share element for the current group chief
executive will be based on long-term personal leadership 
measures.
  To simplify the operation of the EDIP and increase transparency, 
the share element will use performance shares rather than the
current performance units and multiples.
  The performance shares will accrue dividends during the
performance period.
  The current shareholding requirement for executive directors 
is to be maintained at 5 x the director's base salary, to ensure
alignment of their interests with those of shareholders.
  The current pension approach based on national policies is to 
be maintained. 
  The wider scene, including pay and employment conditions
elsewhere in the group, will be taken into account, especially 
when determining annual salary increases.
Elements of remuneration The executive directors' total remuneration
will continue to consist of salary, annual bonus, long-term incentives,
pensions and other benefits. This reward structure will be regularly
reviewed by the committee to ensure that it is achieving its objectives.
In 2005, over three-quarters of executive directors' potential direct
remuneration will again be performance-related (see illustrative chart
on page 118). Directors' remuneration report
118
This chart reflects on-target values for annual bonus and share element.
Salary The committee expects to review salaries in 2005. In doing 
so, the committee considers both Europe-based top global companies 
and the US oil and gas sector; each of these groups is defined and
analysed by the committee's independent external remuneration
advisers. The committee then assesses the market information 
and advice and applies its judgement in setting the salary levels. 
Annual bonus Each executive director is eligible to participate in an
annual performance-based bonus scheme. The committee reviews 
and sets bonus targets and levels of eligibility annually. 
For 2005, the target level will be increased from 100% to 120% 
of base salary (except for Lord Browne, for whom, as group chief
executive, it is considered appropriate to increase his target from
110% to 130%). These increases reflect part of the value previously
attributed to the share option element of their remuneration packages.
In normal circumstances, the maximum payment level for substantially
exceeding targets will continue to be 150% (165% for the group chief
executive) of base salary. In exceptional circumstances, outstanding
performance may be recognized by bonus payments moderately in
excess of the 150% (and 165%) levels at the discretion of the
remuneration committee. Similarly, bonuses may be reduced where 
the committee considers that this is warranted and, in exceptional
circumstances, bonuses can be reduced to zero. 
The committee recognizes that it is responsible to shareholders 
to use its discretion in a reasonable and informed manner in the best
interests of the company and that it has a corresponding duty to be
accountable and transparent as to the manner in which it exercises 
its discretion. The committee will explain any significant exercise of
discretion in the subsequent directors' remuneration report. 
The key aim of the revised annual bonus is to ensure that it is
closely tied to the annual business plan and that it reflects short-term
deliverables towards the creation of long-term shareholder value.
Executive directors' annual bonus awards for 2005 will be based on
a mix of demanding financial targets, based on the company's annual
plan and leadership objectives established at the beginning of the year,
in accordance with the following weightings:
  50% financial measures from the annual plan principally on 
cash flow.
  30% annual strategic metrics and milestones taken from the 
five-year group business plan. There is a wide range of measures,
including those relating to people, safety, environment, technology
and organization, as well as operational actions and business
development. 
  20% individual performance against leadership objectives and 
living the values of the group which incorporates BP's code 
of conduct.
On-target remuneration elements
Base salary
Performance-related annual bonus
Performance-related share element
In assessing the final outcome of the individual bonuses each year, 
the committee will also carefully review the underlying performance 
of the group in the context of the five-year group business plan, as well
as looking at competitor results, analysts' reports and the views from
the chairmen of other BP board committees. All the calculations are
reviewed by the auditors.
Long-term incentives Long-term incentives will continue to be
provided under the EDIP . It will continue to have within its framework
three elements: a share element, a share option element and a cash
element. The committee does not currently intend to use either the
share option or cash elements but, in exceptional circumstances, 
may do so.
Each executive director participates in the EDIP . The committee' s
policy, subject to unforeseen circumstances, is that this should
continue until the EDIP expires or is renewed in 2010. 
The committee's policy continues to be that each executive director
should hold shares equivalent in value to 5 x the director's base salary
within five years of being appointed an executive director. This policy 
is reflected in the terms of the EDIP , as shares awarded under the
share element will only be released at the end of the three-year
retention period (as described below) if the minimum shareholding
guidelines have been met.
1. Share element  The committee may make conditional share 
awards (performance shares) to executive directors, which will 
only vest to the extent that a demanding performance condition
imposed by the committee is met at the end of a three-year
performance period. As explained above, for 2005 and future 
years, the committee currently intends that the share element alone
will provide the long-term performance-based component of the
executive directors' package, and award levels have been adjusted 
to reflect this. 
Share element awards have been made in 2001 to 2004 inclusive
using performance units that may convert into ordinary shares at a
ratio of up to two shares for each performance unit (full details of
which are set out on page 123). To simplify the operation of the plan
and increase transparency, the award of performance shares will, 
for 2005 and future years, replace performance units. Vesting of
performance shares will be at a maximum ratio of one-for-one. 
This change will not increase the value of the award levels or 
make performance conditions easier to achieve. 
The maximum number of performance shares that may be 
awarded to an executive director in any one year will be determined 
at the discretion of the remuneration committee and will not normally 
exceed 5.5 x base salary and, in the case of the group chief executive,
7.5 x base salary. 
In addition to the performance condition described below, 
the committee will have an overriding discretion, in exceptional
circumstances, to reduce the number of shares which vest (or 
to provide that no shares vest). 
The shares which vest will normally be subject to a compulsory
retention period determined by the committee, which will not normally
be less than three years. This gives executive directors a six-year
incentive structure, and is designed to ensure that their interests are
aligned with those of shareholders. Where shares ~est under awards
made in 2005 and future years, the executive director will receive
additional shares representing the value of reinvested dividends 
on these shares. BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004
119
For share element awards in 2005, the performance condition 
will relate to BP's total shareholder return (TSR) performance against
the other oil majors (ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and ChevronTexaco) 
over a three-year period. TSR is calculated by taking the share price
performance of a company over the period, assuming dividends 
to be reinvested in the company's shares. All share prices will be
averaged over the three months before the beginning and end of 
the performance period and will be measured in US dollars. At the 
end of the performance period, the TSR performance of each of 
the companies will be ranked to establish the relative total return 
to shareholders over the period. Shares under the award will vest 
as to 100%, 70% and 35% if BP achieves first, second or third place
respectively; no shares will vest if BP achieves fourth or fifth place. 
Extensive research was independently commissioned by the 
committee into alternative measures of business performance. After
careful review of the studies, the committee is satisfied that relative 
TSR is the most appropriate measure of performance for BP's long-
term incentives for executive directors as it best reflects the creation
of long-term shareholder value. Relative performance of the peer group
is particularly key in order to minimize the influence of sector-specific 
effects, including oil price. 
The committee is convinced that this comparator group, while 
small, has the distinct advantage of being very clearly comprised 
of BP's global competitors. Consultation with major shareholders
confirmed that this is the group already used by most of them, as 
well as by management, in assessing BP's comparative performance.
The committee will have the discretion to amend this peer group in
appropriate circumstances, for example, in the case of any significant
consolidations in the industry. 
The committee is mindful of the possibility that a simple ranking
system may in some circumstances give rise to distorted results in
view of the broad similarity of the oil majors' underlying businesses,
the small size of the comparator group and inherent imperfections 
in measurement. To counter this, the committee will have the ability 
to exercise discretion in a reasonable and informed manner to adjust
(upwards or downwards) the vesting level derived from the ranking 
if it considers that the ranking does not fairly reflect BP's underlying
business performance relative to the comparator group.
The exercise of this discretion would be made after a broad analysis
of the underlying health of BP's business relative to competitors, as
shown by a range of other measures including, but not limited to,
return on average capital employed, earnings per share growth,
reserves replacement and cash flow. This will enable a more
comprehensive review of long-term performance, with the aims of
tempering anomalies created by relying solely on a formula-based
approach and ensuring that the objectives of the plan are met. 
It is anticipated that the need to use discretion is most likely to 
arise where the TSR performance of some companies is clustered, 
so that a relatively small difference in TSR performance would 
produce a major difference in vesting levels. In these circumstances,
the committee will have power to adjust the vesting level, normally

by determining an average vesting level for the companies affected 
by the clustering. 
In line with its policy on transparency, the committee will explain 
any adjustment to the relative TSR ranking in the next directors'
remuneration report following the vesting. 
The committee may amend the performance conditions if events
occur that would make the amended conDition a fairer measure of
performance and provided that any amended condition is no easier 
to satisfy.
For 2005, all executive directors will receive performance share
awards on the above basis, over a maximum number of shares set by
reference to 5.5 x base salary. For awards under the share element in
future years, the committee may continue with the same performance
condition, or may impose a different condition which it considers to be
no less demanding. 
As group chief executive, Lord Browne is eligible for performance
share awards of up to 7.5 x base salary. The committee has
determined that, while the largest part of this should relate to 
the TSR measure described above, it is appropriate that a specific 
part (up to 2 x base salary) should be based on long-term leadership
measures. These will focus on sustaining BP's financial, strategic 
and organizational health and will include, but not be limited to,
maintenance of BP's performance culture and the continued
development of BP's business strategy, executive talent and internal
organization. As with the TSR part of his award, this part will be
measured over three-year performance periods. 
Share element awards made in previous years
For outstanding awards of performance units made under the plans 
for the periods 2002-2004, 2003-2005 and 2004-2006, the existing
performance conditions will apply for the three-year performance
periods in each of the plans. The primary measure is BP's shareholder
return against the market (SHRAM), which accounts for nearly two-
thirds of the potential total award, the remainder being assessed on
BP's relative return on average capital employed (ROACE) and earnings
per share growth (EPS). 
BP's SHRAM is measured against the companies in the FTSE 
All World Oil & Gas Index. Companies within the index are weighted
according to their market capitalization at the beginning of each 
three-year period in order to give greatest emphasis to oil majors. 
BP's ROACE and EPS growth are measured against ExxonMobil, 
Shell, Total and ChevronTexaco. All calculations are reviewed by the
auditors to ensure that they meet an independent objective standard.
The relative position of the company within the comparator group
determines the number of shares awarded per performance unit,
subject to a maximum of two shares per unit. 
2. Share option element The share option element of the EDIP 
permits options to be granted to executive directors at an exercise
price no lower than the market value of a share at the date the 
option is granted. The committee does not currently intend to use 
this element.
3. Cash element The cash element allows the committee to grant 
long-term cash-based incentives. This element was not used during 
the first five years of the EDIP and the committee would only do 
so in special circumstances. 
Pensions Executive directors are eligible to participate in the
appropriate pension schemes applying in their home countries.  Directors' remuneration report
120
UK directors UK directors are members of the regular BP Pension 
Scheme. Scheme members' core benefits are non-contributory. 
They include a pension accrual of 1/60th of basic salary for each year 
of service, subject to a maximum of two-thirds of final basic salary;
and a dependant's benefit of two-thirds of the member's pension.
Bonuses are not pensionable for UK directors. The scheme pension 
is not integrated with state pension benefits.
Normal retirement age is 60, but scheme members who have 30 
or more years' pensionable service at age 55 can elect to retire early
without an actuarial reduction being applied to their pension.
In accordance with the company's past practice for executive
directors who retire from BP on or after age 55 having accrued at 
least 30 years' service, Lord Browne remains eligible for consideration
for a payment from the company of an ex-gratia lump-sum
superannuation payment equal to one year's base salary following 
his retirement. All matters relating to such superannuation payments
are considered by the remuneration committee. Any such payment
would be additional to his pension entitlements referred to above. 
No other executive director is eligible for consideration for a
superannuation payment on retirement, as the remuneration
committee decided in 1996 that appointees to the board after 
that time should cease to be eligible for consideration for such 
a payment. 
The UK government has announced important proposals on pensions,
the impact of which will be reviewed further by the committee in 2005
in conjunction with studies being carried out by the company into the
wider effects of the new legislation for employees. The intention is that
the approach to the new legislation should be consistent for directors
and other employees. The committee will report further on the outcome
of these studies in the next remuneration report.
US director Dr Grote as a US director participates in the US BP
Retirement Accumulation Plan (US plan), which features a cash 
balance formula. The current design of the US plan became effective
on 1 July 2000.
Consistent with US tax regulations, pension benefits are provided
through a combination of tax-qualified and non-qualified benefit
restoration plans, as applicable.
The Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefit (supplemental 
plan) is a non-qualified top-up arrangement that became effective 
on 1 January 2002 for US employees above a specified salary level. 
The benefit formula is 1.3% of final average earnings, which
comprise base salary and bonus in accordance with standard US
practice (as specified under the qualified arrangement) multiplied 
by years of service, with an offset for benefits payable under all other 
BP qualified and non-qualified pension arrangements. This benefit is
unfunded and therefore paid from corporate assets. 
Dr Grote is an eligible participant under the supplemental plan, 
and his pension accrual for 2004 includes the total amount that 
may become payable under all plans.
Other benefits
  Benefits and other share schemes: Executive directors are eligible 
to participate in regular employee benefit plans and in all-employee
share schemes and savings plans applying in their home countries.
Benefits in kind are not pensionable.
  Resettlement allowance: Expatriates may receive a resettlement
allowance for a limited period.

R L Olver 31 December 1997
The committee's policy is for service contracts to expire at normal
retirement date and have a notice period of one year. All contracts
comply with this. 
The service contracts of Dr Allen, Dr Hayward, Mr Manzoni and 
Mr Conn may also be terminated by the company at any time with
immediate effect on payment in lieu of notice equivalent to one year's
salary or the amount of salary that would have been paid if the contract
had terminated on the expiry of the remainder of the notice period.
Dr Grote's service contract is with BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. 
He is seconded to BP p.l.c. under a secondment agreement dated 
7 August 2000 that had an unexpired term of three years at
31 December 2004. The secondment may be terminated by one
month's notice by either party and terminates automatically on the
termination of Dr Grote's service contract. 
There are no other provisions for compensation payable on early
termination of the above contracts. In the event of early termination
under any of the above contracts by the company other than for 
cause (or under a specific termination payment provision), the relevant
director's then current salary and benefits would be taken into account
in calculating any liability of the company. 
Since January 2003, the committee has included a provision in 
new service contracts to allow for severance payments to be phased,
where appropriate to do so. It will also consider mitigation to reduce
compensation to a departing director, where appropriate to do so.

Salary Following a review of appropriate comparator groups of 
Europe-based top global companies and the US oil and gas sector,
base salaries for Lord Browne, Dr Allen, Dr Hayward and Mr Manzoni
were increased by 5% per annum with effect from 1 July 2004. 
On his appointment to the board in 2004, Mr Conn's salary was
determined by reference to the same comparator groups.
In deciding upon these new salary levels the committee applied

Dr Grote's salary was increased in the context of the comparative
market information by approximately 15% with effect from 1 July 2004
to reflect his expanded senior role following the retirement of Mr Olver. 
Annual bonus Fifty per cent of the annual bonus awards for 2004 is
based on a mix of financial targets (primarily cash from operations) and
50% is based on long-run metrics and wide-ranging milestones that
drive performance improvement and measure the continuing delivery
of strategy (including production and sales levels, efficiency, cost
management, business development, project delivery and technology
progress). All the targets were established at the beginning of the year
by the remuneration committee. 2004 was an extremely good year.
The group met or exceeded its annual plan in all material respects. The
primary financial target, cash from operations, was exceeded. All the
key metrics and milestones were delivered, along with some notable
successes in relation to Russia and exploration in Egypt and the Gulf 
of Mexico. Assessment of all the results, including those on people,
safety, environment and organization, resulted in awards of 150% of
salary for the executive directors. The committee determined that, given
the year's excellent performance, it was appropriate that Lord Browne
receive 165% of salary, reflecting his higher bonus target level. All
calculations have been reviewed by the auditors.

The closing market prices of an ordinary share and of an ADS on 31 December 2004 were  5.08 and $58.40 respectively. During 2004, the highest market prices 
were  5.56 and $62.10 respectively, and the lowest market prices were  4.13 and $46.65 respectively.
EDIP = Executive Directors' Incentive Plan adopted by shareholders in April 2000 as described on pages 118-119. The grants were made taking into consideration 
thE ranking of the company's TSR against the TSR of the FTSE Global 100 group of companies over the three-year period prior to the grant.
BPA = BP Amoco share option plan, which applied to US executive directors prior to the adoption of the EDIP .
SAR = Stock Appreciation Rights under BP America Inc. Share Appreciation Plan. In keeping with the US market practice, none of the options under the BPA and 
SAR is subject to performance conditions because they were granted under American plans to the relevant individuals.
SAYE = Save As You Earn employee share option scheme. These options are not subject to performance conditions because this is an all-employee share scheme
governed by specific tax legislation.
EXEC = Executive Share Option Scheme. These options were granted to the relevant individuals prior to their appointments as directors and are not subject to 
performance conditions.

Share element of EDIP and Long T erm Performance Plans (LTPPs) 
Under the share element of the EDIP and the Long Term Performance
Plans, performance units were granted at the beginning of the three-
year period and converted into an award of shares at the end of the
period, depending on performance. There is a maximum of two shares
per performance unit. For 2005 and future years, a different grant
mechanism will apply (as described on page 118). 
For the 2002-2004 share element of the EDIP and the LTPPs, BP's
performance was assessed in terms of SHRAM, ROACE and EPS
growth. BP's three-year SHRAM was measured against the companies
in the FTSE All World Oil & Gas Index. Companies within the index 
are weighted according to their market capitalization at the beginning
of each three-year period in order to give greatest emphasis to oil
majors. BP's ROACE and EPS were measured against ExxonMobil,
Shell, Total and ChevronTexaco. Based on a performance assessment
of 75 points out of 200 (0 for SHRAM, 50 for ROACE and 25 for EPS
growth), the committee expects to make awards of shares to executive
directors as highlighted in the 2002-2004 lines of the table below.

Dr Allen, Dr Hayward and Mr Manzoni continue to have performance units for the performance periods 2001-2003 and 2002-2004 granted under LTPPs, 
and Mr Conn for the periods 2001-2003 to 2004-2006 inclusive. They are not required to relinquish these rights, which were granted prior to their appointments 
as executive directors. All other units were granted under the EDIP as explained on pages 118-119. BP's performance is assessed against the oil sector. 
For 1998-2000, BP's SHRAM was measured against ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and ChevronTexaco. For 2001-2003, BP's SHRAM, ROACE and EPS growth 
were measured against ExxonMobil, Shell, Total, ChevronTexaco, ENI and Repsol. For 2004-2006, BP's SHRAM is measured against companies in the 
All World Oil & Gas Index and BP's ROACE and EPS growth against ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and ChevronTexaco. Each performance period ends on 
31 December of the third year.
b

Past directors
Following his retirement from BP p.l.c., Mr Olver was appointed on 
1 July 2004 as a consultant to BP in relation to its activities in Russia. 
He had previously been appointed as a BP-nominated director of 
TNK-BP Limited, a joint venture company owned 50% by BP , 
effective 20 April 2004. Under the consultancy agreement, he 
received  150,000 in fees in 2004 and, as a director, deputy chairman
and chairman of the audit committee of the joint venture company, 
he received $90,000 in fees from TNK-BP Limited.
Part 2 - Non-executive directors' remuneration
Policy on non-executive directors' remuneration
The board sets the level of remuneration for all non-executive directors
within the limit approved from time to time by shareholders. In line
with BP's governance policies, by the remuneration of the chairman is 
set by the board rather than by the remuneration committee, since the
performance of the chairman is a matter for the board as a whole
rather than any one committee.
The board has adopted the following policies to guide its current 
and future decision-making with regard to non-executive directors'
remuneration.
  Within the limits set by the shareholders from time to time,
remuneration should be sufficient to attract, motivate and 
retain world-class non-executive talent. 
  Remuneration of non-executive directors is set by the board and
should be proportional to their contribution towards the interests 
of the company.
  Remuneration practice should be consistent with recognized 
best-practice standards for non-executive directors' remuneration.
  Remuneration should be in the form of cash fees, payable monthly.
  Non-executive directors should not receive share options from 
the company. 
  Non-executive directors should be encouraged to establish 
a holding in BP shares broadly related to one year's base fee, 
to be held directly or indirectly in a manner compatible with 
their personal investment activities, and any applicable legal 
and regulatory requirements.
Elements of remuneration
Non-executive directors' pay comprises cash fees, paid monthly, 
with increments for positions of additional responsibility, reflecting
additional workload and consequent potential liability. For all non-
executive directors, except the chairman, a fixed sum allowance 
is paid for transatlantic travel undertaken for the purpose of 
attending a board or board committee meeting. In addition, non-
executive directors receive reimbursement of reasonable travel 
and related business expenses. No share or share option awards 
are made to any non-executive director in respect of service on 
the board. 
Letters of appointment
Non-executive directors have letters of appointment, which recognize
that, subject to the Articles of Association, their service is at the
discretion of the shareholders. All directors stand for re-election 
at each annual general meeting.

Amoco Non-Employee Directors' Restricted Stock Plan
Non-executive directors of Amoco Corporation were allocated
restricted stock in the Amoco Non-Employee Directors' Restricted
Stock Plan by way of remuneration for their service on the board of
Amoco Corporation prior to its merger with BP in 1998. On merger,
interests in Amoco shares in the plan were converted into interests
in BP ADSs. Under the terms of the plan, the restricted stock will vest
upon the retirement of the non-executive director having reached age
70 or upon earlier retirement at the discretion of the board. Since the
merger, no further entitlements have accrued to any director under the
plan. These residual interests require disclosure under the directors'
remuneration report regulations 2002 as interests in a long-term
incentive scheme.

No awards were granted and no awards lapsed during the year.
b
For the purposes of the regulations, the date on which the director retires
from the board at or after the age of 70 is the end of the qualifying period. 
If the director retires prior to this date, the board may waive the restrictions.
c
Mr Maljers retired from the board on 15 April 2004 and, in accordance with
the terms of the plan, his awards vested on that date (when the BP ADS
closing price was $54.16) without payment by him. These awards over 
BP ADSs derived from awards over Amoco shares granted between 
26 April 1994 and 28 April 1998. The awards were granted over Amoco 
stock prior to the merger but their notional weighted average market 
value at the date of grant (applying the subsequent merger ratio of 
0.66167 of a BP ADS for every Amoco share) was $27.87 per BP ADS. 
Superannuation gratuities
In accordance with the company's long-standing practice, non-
executive directors who retire from the board after at least six years'
service are, at the time of their retirement, eligible for consideration 
for a superannuation gratuity. The board is authorized to make such
payments under the company's Articles. The amount of the payment 
is determined at the board's discretion (having regard to the director's
period of service as a director and other relevant factors). 
In 2002, the board revised its policy with respect to such payments
so that: (i) non-executive directors appointed to the board after 1 July
2002 would not be eligible for consideration for such a payment; and 
(ii) while non-executive directors in service at 1 July 2002 would remain
eligible for consideration for a payment, service after that date would
not be taken into account by the board in considering the amount of
any such payment. 
The board made no superannuation gratuity payments during 
the year. 
This directors' remuneration report was approved by the board 
and signed on its behalf by David J Jackson, company secretary, 
on 7 February 2005.
