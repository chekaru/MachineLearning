Directors' remuneration report
second part, which was prepared by the company secretary on 
behalf of the board.
The report has been approved by the board and signed on its 
behalf by the company secretary. This report is subject to the 
approval of shareholders at the annual general meeting (AGM).
The directors' remuneration report covers all directors, both 
executive and non-executive, and is set out on pages 164-173.
It is divided into two parts. Executive directors' remuneration 
is in the first part, which was prepared by the remuneration
committee. Non-executive directors' remuneration is in the 
Part 1 - Executive directors' remuneration
DEAR SHAREHOLDER  As described in this Annual Report, 2005 was a year of strong financial performance for the group set against a background 
of a number of significant events - both positive and negative. It was also a year in which you, our shareholders, approved the renewal of the 
long-term incentive plan for the executive directors. 
I am pleased to report that this plan has been implemented and is a key part of our policy on remuneration. This revised policy has provided an
effective framework against which to evaluate the performance of the executive directors. In a performance-driven organization, the measurement
of that performance is critical. We believe that we have an appropriate balance of quantitative and qualitative measures. Equally, the policy allows
the remuneration committee to exercise judgement when it is appropriate to do so.
During the year, the executive team demonstrated strong leadership and delivery against a demanding set of targets. They managed events 
well and group performance was also strong. Against this backdrop, the significant events of the year were also taken into account in the
committee's overall judgement of results.
Full details of executive directors' remuneration are set out in the pages that follow. I am confident that the committee's approach aligns 
executive remuneration with the interests of shareholders as well as rewarding and engaging the world-class team of people that we have leading
this company.

the committee's decisions. The committee met six times in the 
period under review. There was a full attendance record, except 
for Mr Davis and Sir Robin Nicholson who were each unable to 
attend one meeting and Mr Knight who was unable to attend two 
meetings. Mr Sutherland, as chairman of the board, attended all
committee meetings.
The committee is accountable to shareholders through its annual
report on executive directors' remuneration. It will consider the
outcome of the vote at the AGM on the directors' remuneration 
report and take into account the views of shareholders in its future
decisions. The committee values its dialogue with major shareholders
on remuneration matters.
Advice Advice is provided to the committee by the company
secretary's office, which is independent of executive management
and reports to the chairman of the board. Mr Aronson, an independent
consultant, is the committee's secretary and special adviser. 
Advice was also received from Mr Jackson (company secretary) 
and Mrs Martin (senior counsel, company secretary's office).
The committee also appoints external professional advisers to
provide specialist advice and services on particular remuneration
matters. The independence of advice is subject to annual review. 
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Tasks  The committee's tasks are:
    To determine, on behalf of the board, the terms of engagement 
and remuneration of the group chief executive and the executive
directors and to report on those to the shareholders.
    To determine, on behalf of the board, matters of policy over 
which the company has authority relating to the establishment or
operation of the company's pension scheme of which the executive
directors are members.
    To nominate, on behalf of the board, any trustees (or directors of
corporate trustees) of such scheme.
    To monitor the policies being applied by the group chief executive 
in remunerating senior executives other than executive directors.
Constitution and operation The committee members are all 
non-executive directors. Dr Julius (chairman), Mr Bryan, Mr Davis, 
Sir Tom McKillop and Sir Ian Prosser were members of the committee
throughout the year. Sir Robin Nicholson and Mr Knight retired from
the committee at the 2005 AGM. Each member is now subject to
annual re-election as a director of the company. The board considers
all committee members to be independent (see pages 159-160). They 
have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in  The committee continued the engagement of Towers Perrin as its
principal external adviser during 2005. Towers Perrin also provided
limited ad hoc remuneration and benefits advice to parts of the group,
mainly comprising pensions advice in Canada, as well as providing
some market information on pay structures. The committee also
continued the engagement of Kepler Associates to advise on
performance measurement. Kepler Associates also provided
performance data and limited ad hoc advice on performance
measurement to the group.
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer provided legal advice on specific
matters to the committee as well as providing some legal advice 
to the group.
Ernst & Young reviewed the calculations in respect of financial-
based targets that form the basis of the performance-related pay 
for the executive directors. They also provided audit, audit-related 
and taxation services to the group.
Lord Browne (group chief executive) was consulted on matters
relating to the other executive directors who report to him and on
matters relating to the performance of the company. He was not
present when matters affecting his own remuneration were considered.
POLICY ON EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
During 2004, the committee carried out a comprehensive and
independent review of all elements of remuneration policy for executive
directors, culminating in a shareholder resolution at the 2005 AGM
approving the renewal of the Executive Directors' Incentive Plan (EDIP).
The committee seeks to ensure that, in determining remuneration policy,
there is a clear link between the company's purpose, the business 
plans and executive reward. The following key principles guide its policy:
    Policy for the remuneration of executive directors will be
determined and regularly reviewed independently of executive
management and will set the tone for the remuneration of other
senior executives.
    The remuneration structure will support and reflect BP's stated
purpose to maximize long-term shareholder value.
    The remuneration structure will reflect a just system of rewards 
for the participants.
    The overall quantum of all potential remuneration components 
will be determined by the exercise of informed judgement of 
the independent remuneration committee, taking into account 
the success of BP and the competitive global market.
    The majority of the remuneration will be linked to the achievement of
demanding performance targets that are independently set and
reflect the creation of long-term shareholder value.
    A significant personal shareholding will be developed in order to
align executive and shareholder interests.
    Assessment of performance will be quantitative and qualitative and
will include exercise of informed judgement by the remuneration
committee within a framework that takes account of sector
characteristics and is approved by shareholders.
    The committee will be proactive in obtaining an understanding 
of shareholder preferences.
    Remuneration policy and practices will be as transparent as
possible, both for participants and shareholders.
    The wider scene, including pay and employment conditions
elsewhere in the group, will be taken into account, especially 
when determining annual salary increases.
Elements of remuneration The executive directors' total remuneration
will consist of salary, annual bonus, long-term incentives, pensions
and other benefits. This reward structure will be regularly reviewed 
by the committee to ensure that it is achieving its objectives. 
In 2006, over three-quarters of executive directors' potential direct
remuneration will again be performance-related (see illustrative 
chart below).
This chart reflects on-target values for annual bonus and share element.
ON-TARGET REMUNERATION ELEMENTS
Base salary

Performance-related share element
Salary The committee expects to review salaries in 2006. In doing 
so, the committee considers both top Europe-based global companies
and the US oil and gas sector; each of these groups is defined and
analysed by the committee's independent external remuneration
advisers. The committee then assesses the market information and
advice and applies its judgement in setting the salary levels. 
Annual bonus Each executive director is eligible to participate in an
annual performance-based bonus scheme. The committee reviews
and sets bonus targets and levels of eligibility annually. 
For 2006, the target level is 120% of base salary (except for 
Lord Browne, for whom, as group chief executive, it is considered
appropriate to have a target of 130%). In normal circumstances, the
maximum payment level for substantially exceeding targets will continue
to be 150% (165% for the group chief executive) of base salary. In
exceptional circumstances, outstanding performance may be recognized
by bonus payments moderately above the 150% (and 165%) levels at
the discretion of the remuneration committee. Similarly, bonuses may
be reduced where the committee considers that this is warranted
and, in exceptional circumstances, bonuses can be reduced to zero. 
The committee recognizes that it is responsible to shareholders 
to use its discretion in a reasonable and informed manner in the best
interests of the company and that it has a corresponding duty to be
accountable and transparent as to the manner in which it exercises 
its discretion. The committee will explain any significant exercise of
discretion in the subsequent directors' remuneration report. 
Executive directors' annual bonus awards for 2006 will be based 
on a mix of demanding financial targets, based on the company's
annual plan and leadership objectives established at the beginning 
of the year, in accordance with the following weightings:
    50% financial and operational metrics from the annual plan, principally
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
(EBITDA) and return on average capital employed (ROACE).
    30% annual strategic milestones taken from the five-year group
business plan, including those relating to technology, operational
actions and business development. 
    20% individual performance against leadership objectives and living
the values of the group, which incorporates BP's code of conduct.
In assessing the final outcome of the individual bonuses each year,
the committee will also carefully review the underlying performance
of the group in the context of the five-year group business plan, as
well as looking at competitor results, analysts' reports and the views
from the chairmen of other BP board committees. All the calculations
are reviewed by Ernst & Young.
Long-term incentives Long-term incentives will continue to be
provided under the EDIP . It has three elements within its framework: 
BP Annual Report and Accounts 2005 165 166 Making energy more
directors as it best reflects the creation of long-term shareholder value.
Relative performance of the peer group is particularly key in order to
minimize the influence of sector-specific effects, including oil price.
The committee is mindful of the possibility that a simple ranking
system may in some circumstances give rise to distorted results in
view of the broad similarity of the oil majors' underlying businesses,
the small size of the comparator group and inherent imperfections 
in measurement. To counter this, the committee will have the ability 
to exercise discretion in a reasonable and informed manner to adjust
(upwards or downwards) the vesting level derived from the ranking 
if it considers that the ranking does not fairly reflect BP's underlying
business performance relative to the comparator group.
The exercise of this discretion would be made after a broad analysis
of the underlying health of BP's business relative to competitors, as
shown by a range of other measures including, but not limited to,
ROACE, earnings per share (EPS) growth, reserves replacement and
cash flow. This will enable a more comprehensive review of long-term
performance, with the aims of tempering anomalies created by relying
solely on a formula-based approach and ensuring that the objectives 
of the plan are met. 
It is anticipated that the need to use discretion is most likely to
arise where the TSR performance of some companies is clustered, 
so that a relatively small difference in TSR performance would 
produce a major difference in vesting levels. In these circumstances,
the committee will have power to adjust the vesting level, normally 
by determining an average vesting level for the companies affected 
by the clustering. 
In line with its policy on transparency, the committee will explain
any adjustment to the relative TSR ranking in the next directors'
remuneration report following the vesting. 
The committee may amend the performance conditions if events
occur that would make the amended condition a fairer measure of
performance and provided that any amended condition is no easier 
to satisfy.
For 2006, all executive directors will receive performance share
awards on the above basis, over a maximum number of shares 
set by reference to 5.5 x base salary. For awards under the share 
element in future years, the committee may continue with the same
performance condition or may impose a different condition, which it
considers to be no less demanding. 
As group chief executive, Lord Browne is eligible for performance
share awards of up to 7.5 x base salary. The committee has
determined that, while the largest part of this should relate to the 
TSR measure described above, it continues to be appropriate that 
a specific part (up to 2 x base salary) should be based on long-term
leadership measures. These will focus on sustaining BP's financial,
strategic and organizational health and will include, but not be limited
to, maintenance of BP's performance culture and the continued
development of BP's business strategy, executive talent and internal
organization. As with the TSR part of his award, this part will be
measured over a three-year performance period. 
Share element awards made in previous years  Awards for the period
2005-2007 were made on the same basis as described above. For
outstanding awards of performance units made under the plans for
the periods 2003-2005 and 2004-2006, the previous performance
conditions will apply for the three-year performance periods in each 
of the plans. The primary measure is BP's shareholder return against
the market (SHRAM), which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the
potential total award, the remainder being assessed on BP's relative
ROACE and EPS growth. 
BP's SHRAM is measured against the companies in the FTSE All
World Oil & Gas Index. Companies within the index are weighted
a share element, a share option element and a cash element. The
committee does not currently intend to use either the share option 
or cash elements but, in exceptional circumstances, may do so.
Each executive director participates in the EDIP . The committee' s
policy, subject to unforeseen circumstances, is that this should
continue until the EDIP expires or is renewed in 2010. 
The committee's policy continues to be that each executive director
should hold shares equivalent in value to 5 x the director's base salary
within five years of being appointed an executive director. This policy
is reflected in the terms of the EDIP , as shares awarded under the
share element will only be released at the end of the three-year
retention period (as described below) if the minimum shareholding
guidelines have been met.
1. Share element The committee may make conditional share awards
(performance shares) to executive directors, which will only vest to
the extent that a demanding performance condition imposed by the
committee is met at the end of a three-year performance period. 
The maximum number of performance shares that may be 
awarded to an executive director in any one year will be determined 
at the discretion of the remuneration committee and will not normally
exceed 5.5 x base salary and, in the case of the group chief executive,
7.5 x base salary. 
In addition to the performance condition described below, 
the committee will have an overriding discretion, in exceptional
circumstances, to reduce the number of shares that vest (or to
provide that no shares vest). 
The shares that vest will normally be subject to a compulsory
retention period determined by the committee, which will not
normally be less than three years. This gives executive directors 
a six-year incentive structure and is designed to ensure that their
interests are aligned with those of shareholders. Where shares vest
under awards made in 2005 and future years, the executive director
will receive additional shares representing the value of reinvested
dividends on these shares.
For share element awards in 2006, the performance condition will
(as in 2005) relate to BP's total shareholder return (TSR) performance
against the other oil majors (ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and Chevron)
over a three-year period. The committee will have the discretion to
amend this peer group in appropriate circumstances, for example, 
in the case of any significant consolidations in the industry. TSR is
calculated by taking the share price performance of a company over
the period, assuming dividends to be reinvested in the company's
shares. All share prices will be averaged over the three months 
before the beginning and end of the performance period and will be
measured in US dollars. At the end of the performance period, the
TSR performance of each of the companies will be ranked to establish
the relative total return to shareholders over the period. Shares under
the award will vest as to 100%, 70% and 35% if BP achieves first,
second or third place respectively; no shares will vest if BP achieves
fourth or fifth place. 
The committee considers that relative TSR is the most appropriate
measure of performance for BP's long-term incentives for executive

BP's ROACE and EPS growth are measured against ExxonMobil, 
Shell, Total and Chevron. All calculations are reviewed by Ernst &
Young to ensure that they meet an independent objective standard.
The relative position of the company within the comparator group
determines the number of shares awarded per performance unit,
subject to a maximum of two shares per unit. 
2. Share option element The share option element of the EDIP
permits options to be granted to executive directors at an exercise
price no lower than the market value of a share at the date the 
option is granted. The committee does not currently intend to use 
this element.
3. Cash element  The cash element allows the committee to grant
long-term cash-based incentives. This element has not been used
since the EDIP was established in 2000 and the committee would
only do so in special circumstances. 
Pensions  Executive directors are eligible to participate in the
appropriate pension schemes applying in their home countries. 
UK directors UK directors are members of the regular BP Pension
Scheme. Scheme members' core benefits are non-contributory. 
They include a pension accrual of 1/60th of basic salary for each year
of service, subject to a maximum of two-thirds of final basic salary,
and a dependant's benefit of two-thirds of the member's pension.
Bonuses are not pensionable for UK directors. The scheme pension 
is not integrated with state pension benefits.
Normal retirement age is 60, but scheme members who have 
30 or more years' pensionable service at age 55 can elect to retire
early without an actuarial reduction being applied to their pension.
In accordance with the company's past practice for executive
directors who retire from BP on or after age 55 having accrued at
least 30 years' service, Lord Browne remains eligible for consideration
for a payment from the company of an ex-gratia lump-sum
superannuation payment equal to one year's base salary following his
retirement. All matters relating to such superannuation payments are
considered by the remuneration committee. Any such payment would
be additional to his pension entitlements referred to above. No other
executive director is eligible for consideration for a superannuation
payment on retirement, because the remuneration committee decided
in 1996 that appointees to the board after that time should cease to
be eligible for consideration for such a payment. 
The UK government has made important changes to the 
operation and taxation of UK pensions, which come into effect 
from 6 April 2006 and affect all UK employees. The remuneration
committee has reviewed and approved proposals by the company 
that maintain the pension promise for all UK employees but that
deliver pension benefits in excess of the new lifetime allowance of 
 1.5 million (or personal lifetime allowance as at 6 April 2006 under
statute if higher) via an unapproved, unfunded pension arrangement
paid by the company direct. 
The trustee directors of the BP Pension Scheme have reviewed, 
in accordance with its statutory obligation, the actuarial basis under
which cash equivalent transfer values are payable to all UK employees
who participate in that scheme. Consistent with evolving actuarial
practice, the trustee directors have resolved to base cash equivalent
transfer values on a similar basis to that underlying the company's
accounts, including allowance for improving longevity in accordance
with standard tables; this has the effect of increasing cash equivalent
transfer values for the UK executive directors on average by about
15%. Although the change became effective in January 2006, the
table on page 171 shows both 31 December 2004 and 31 December
2005 transfer value figures on the new basis.
US director  As a US director, Dr Grote participates in the US BP
Retirement Accumulation Plan (US plan), which features a cash
balance formula. The current design of the US plan became effective
on 1 July 2000.
Consistent with US tax regulations, pension benefits are provided
through a combination of tax-qualified and non-qualified benefit
restoration plans, as applicable.
The Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefit (supplemental
plan) is a non-qualified top-up arrangement that became effective 
on 1 January 2002 for US employees above a specified salary level. 
The benefit formula is 1.3% of final average earnings, which
comprise base salary and bonus in accordance with standard US
practice (as specified under the qualified arrangement) multiplied 
by years of service, with an offset for benefits payable under all other 
BP qualified and non-qualified pension arrangements. This benefit is
unfunded and therefore paid from corporate assets. 
Dr Grote is an eligible participant under the supplemental plan
and his pension accrual for 2005 includes the total amount that may
become payable under all plans.
Other benefits
    Benefits and other share schemes: Executive directors are eligible
to participate in regular employee benefit plans and in all-employee
share schemes and savings plans applying in their home countries.
Benefits in kind are not pensionable.
    Resettlement allowance: Expatriates may receive a resettlement
allowance for a limited period.

Dr A B Hayward 29 Jan 2003  441,000
J A Manzoni 29 Jan 2003  441,000
The committee's policy is for service contracts to expire at normal
retirement date and have a notice period of one year. All contracts
comply with this. 
The service contracts of Dr Allen, Mr Conn, Dr Hayward and
Mr Manzoni may be terminated by the company at any time 
with immediate effect on payment in lieu of notice equivalent to 
one year's salary or the amount of salary that would have been paid 
if the contract had terminated on the expiry of the remainder of the
notice period.
Dr Grote's service contract is with BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. He is
seconded to BP p.l.c. under a secondment agreement dated 7 August
2000 that had an unexpired term of two years at 31 December 2005.
The secondment may be terminated by one month's notice by either
party and terminates automatically on the termination of Dr Grote's
service contract. 
There are no other provisions for compensation payable on early
termination of the above contracts. In the event of early termination
under any of the above contracts by the company other than for 
cause (or under a specific termination payment provision), the relevant
director's then current salary and benefits would be taken into account
in calculating any liability of the company.

Salary Base salaries for all executive directors were reviewed relative
to top Europe-based global companies and the US oil and gas sector.
Having taken account of market movements and performance, the
committee awarded a 5% increase in base salaries with effect from 
1 July 2005 for all exective directors except Mr Conn, whose increase
was slightly higher to bring him to the same level as his peers.
Annual bonus  The measures and weightings described earlier form

2005 ACTUAL REMUNERATION ELEMENTS
measures were taken from the annual plan principally on cash flow.
Cash flow was strong. Amounts received from the divestment of 
non-strategic assets significantly exceeded internal targets (principally
due to the Innovene disposal) and these, along with other actions 
and successes, more than offset reductions in cash flow caused 
by adverse events. Production rates, allowing for the impact of oil
prices on production-sharing contracts and weather-related downtime,
were within internal expectations. 
Annual strategic metrics and milestones were taken from the 
five-year group business plan. There is a wide range of measures,
including those relating to people, safety, environment, technology 
and organization as well as operations and business development. 
The group continued to perform well, developing business in Russia,
India and elsewhere. New fields came on stream in the US, Angola,
Azerbaijan and Trinidad & Tobago. A new code of conduct was
launched and employees were trained in its application. Safety
performance was impaired by the incident at Texas City.
Individual performance against leadership objectives was
reviewed by the committee, as was the underlying performance
of the group in the context of the five-year plan, together with
competitor results and positioning. Results are in line with or
exceed expectations.
The committee also considered this performance in the light of 
the significant events during the year, both positive and negative.
These included the high prices of oil and gas; the overall financial
performance of the group; the disposal of non-strategic assets,
principally Innovene; the financial and other consequences of the
serious incident at the Texas City refinery and the repairs to the
Thunder Horse platform; and the effects of the hurricanes in the 
Gulf of Mexico. The scale and the impact of all of these events were
taken into account in determining the annual bonuses, which are set
out in the table above.

Numbers shown are ADSs under option. One ADS is equivalent to six ordinary shares. SHARE ELEMENT OF EDIP AND LONG TERM PERFORMANCE PLANS
Under the share element of the EDIP and the Long Term Performance
Plans (LTPPs), performance units were until 2004 granted at the
beginning of the three-year period and converted into an award of
shares at the end of the period, depending on performance. There is
a maximum of two shares per performance unit. For 2005 and future
years, grants of performance shares are made, being the maximum
number of shares that could vest (as described on pages 165-167). In
the table below, performance units that have yet to convert to shares
are expressed as the maximum number of shares into which they
could convert (based on the maximum 2:1 ratio). This achieves
consistency of disclosure between the two periods.
For the 2003-2005 share element of the EDIP and the LTPPs, 
BP's performance was assessed in terms of SHRAM, ROACE and
EPS growth. BP's three-year SHRAM was measured against the
companies in the FTSE All World Oil & Gas Index. Companies within
the index are weighted according to their market capitalization at 
the beginning of each three-year period in order to give greatest
emphasis to oil majors. BP's ROACE and EPS were measured against
ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and Chevron. Based on a performance
assessment of 75 points out of 200 (0 for SHRAM, 50 for ROACE 
and 25 for EPS growth), the committee expects to make awards 
of shares to executive directors as highlighted in the 2003-2005 lines
of the table below.

Part 2 - Non-executive directors' remuneration
POLICY ON NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
The board sets the level of remuneration for all non-executive
directors within the limit approved from time to time by shareholders.
In line with BP's governance policies, the remuneration of the
chairman is set by the board rather than the remuneration committee,
since the performance of the chairman is a matter for the board as 
a whole rather than any one committee.
The board has adopted the following policies to guide its 
current and future decision-making with regard to non-executive 
directors' remuneration:
    Within the limits set by the shareholders from time to time,
remuneration should be sufficient to attract, motivate and retain
world-class non-executive talent. 
    Remuneration of non-executive directors is set by the board and
should be proportional to their contribution towards the interests 
of the company.
    Remuneration practice should be consistent with recognized 
best-practice standards for non-executive directors' remuneration.
    Remuneration should be in the form of cash fees, payable monthly.
    Non-executive directors should not receive share options from 
the company. 
    Non-executive directors should be encouraged to establish a
holding in BP shares broadly related to one year's base fee, to 
be held directly or indirectly in a manner compatible with their
personal investment activities, and any applicable legal and
regulatory requirements.
ELEMENTS OF REMUNERATION
Non-executive directors' pay comprises cash fees, paid monthly, 
with increments for positions of additional responsibility, reflecting
additional workload and consequent potential liability. For all 
non-executive directors, except the chairman, a fixed sum allowance 
is paid for transatlantic travel (or equivalent intercontinental travel)
undertaken for the purpose of attending a board or board committee
meeting. In addition, non-executive directors receive reimbursement
of reasonable travel and related business expenses. No share or share
option awards are made to any non-executive director in respect of
service on the board. 
LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT
Non-executive directors have letters of appointment, which recognize
that, subject to the Articles of Association, their service is at the
discretion of the shareholders. All directors stand for re-election at
each annual general meeting. 
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' ANNUAL FEE STRUCTURE 
The fees paid to non-executive directors are set by the board within the
limit set by shareholders in accordance with the Articles. Shareholders
approved an increase to this limit in 2004. All fees are fixed and paid in
pounds sterling. Fees payable to non-executive directors were reviewed
in 2005 by an ad hoc board committee comprising Mr Bryan (chairman), 
Dr Julius and Mr Burgmans. This ad hoc committee recommended 
an increase in fees to reflect the increase in director workload as well 
as increases in global market rates for independent/non-executive
directors, since these fees were last reviewed in 2002. The board duly
approved the recommended increases with effect from 1 January 2005.

AMOCO NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS' RESTRICTED STOCK PLAN
Non-executive directors of Amoco Corporation were allocated
restricted stock in the Amoco Non-Employee Directors' Restricted
Stock Plan by way of remuneration for their service on the board of
Amoco Corporation prior to its merger with BP in 1998. On merger,
interests in Amoco shares in the plan were converted into interests 
in BP ADSs. Under the terms of the plan, the restricted stock will 
vest on the retirement of the non-executive director having reached
age 70 or on earlier retirement at the discretion of the board. Since
the merger, no further entitlements have accrued to any director
under the plan. These residual interests require disclosure under 
the directors' remuneration report regulations 2002 as interests 
in a long-term incentive scheme.

No awards were granted and no awards lapsed during the year. The awards
were granted over Amoco stock prior to the merger but their notional weighted
average market value at the date of grant (applying the subsequent merger ratio
of 0.66167 of a BP ADS for every Amoco share) was $27.87 per BP ADS.
b
For the purposes of the regulations, the date on which the director retires from
the board at or after the age of 70 is the end of the qualifying period. If the
director retires prior to this date, the board may waive the restrictions.
SUPERANNUATION GRATUITIES
In accordance with the company's long-standing practice, 
non-executive directors who retired from the board after at least 
six years' service are, at the time of their retirement, eligible for
consideration for a superannuation gratuity. The board is authorized 
to make such payments under the company's Articles. The amount 
of the payment is determined at the board's discretion (having 
regard to the director's period of service as a director and other
relevant factors). 
The board made superannuation gratuity payments during the 
year to the following former directors: Mr Knight  79,000 and Sir
Robin Nicholson  84,000 (who both retired in 2005) and Mr Maljers
 18,000 (who retired in 2004). These payments were in line with the
policy arrangements agreed in 2002 (see below).
In 2002, the board revised its policy with respect to superannuation
gratuities so that: (i) non-executive directors appointed to the board
after 1 July 2002 would not be eligible for consideration for such a
payment; and (ii) while non-executive directors in service at 1 July
2002 would remain eligible for consideration for a payment, service
after that date would not be taken into account by the board in
considering the amount of any such payment.
This directors' remuneration report was approved by the board and
signed on its behalf by David J Jackson, company secretary, on 
6 February 2006.
