Part 1 - Executive directors' remuneration
Dear Shareholder
Executive directors' remuneration for 2006 reflects a clear set of principles, set out in the pages that follow. At their heart is the importance of matching
reward to performance, in a way that both reflects shareholders' interests and provides fair and competitive compensation to the executives.
As described elsewhere, 2006 was a year of strong financial performance for the group. A number of strategic and operational milestones were
attained. However, the year also brought serious challenges and in key operational and safety areas company performance fell short of expectations.
The remuneration committee has carefully evaluated performance against the quantitative measures set at the beginning of the year. We also
made a qualitative assessment of the effect on the company and its reputation of adverse events and developments in the year. The executive team
responded to these challenges with determination and a sincere commitment to implement the lessons learned. However, taking a balanced judgement
on the year, the remuneration committee halved the bonuses that would have resulted directly from their quantitative assessment. This, and all other
remuneration received, is shown on the following page.
We have made some changes to the style and format of the remuneration report this year in order to make it easier to read and understand. Our aim
has been to set out clearly the principles and policy on which we base executive directors' remuneration, as well as the figures for 2006. In addition,
full details of arrangements agreed for Lord Browne's retirement later in 2007 and information on recent changes in remuneration for Dr Hayward and
Mr Inglis are included in the relevant sections.

2006 remuneration
All remuneration paid to executive directors in 2006 is summarized in the table below. The annual bonuses are shown in the year they were earned.
The remuneration committee reviewed base salaries in 2006 and awarded increases between 5% and 10% of base salary from 1 July for each
director. These increases are reflected in the numbers below and their current base salary is shown on page 71.
All executive directors are part of a final salary pension scheme, the details of which are set out later in this report. Accrued annual pension
earned as of 31 December 2006 is  1,050,000 for Lord Browne,  228,000 for Dr Allen,  170,000 for Mr Conn, $675,000 for Dr Grote,  239,000
for Dr Hayward and  188,000 for Mr Manzoni. Service and transfer value detail is shown on page 74.

Annual bonus result
The 2006 annual bonus was based on performance relative to measures
and targets set at the beginning of the year, as well as other factors
the remuneration committee determined were relevant. Financial and
operational metrics from the annual plan carried a 50% weighting and
focused on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(EBITDA), return on average capital employed (ROACE) and safety,
environment and production targets. Strategic milestones, including those
relating to technology, operations and business development, accounted
for 30%. Individual performance, including both leadership objectives and
living the values of the group, accounted for 20%.
On the financial side, underlying EBITDA was marginally below target.
There were negative effects from US operating issues and positive effects
from improvements in operating performance. ROACE was marginally
above target. Cash costs and capital expenditure came in around target
levels. Planned divestments of non-strategic assets achieved premium
prices. Targets were met for personal safety, greenhouse gas emissions,
oil and gas discovered volumes and proved reserves. Average production
rate was below target.
With respect to milestones, seven of nine major projects were
completed as planned. However, the Thunder Horse development was
delayed. Good progress was achieved to define and sanction a further
18 major projects. The alternative energy business exceeded its
objectives. Good progress was made in developing and implementing
a major six-point plan for improving safety and operational integrity.
In terms of individual performance, in a period of significant challenges,
the executive directors demonstrated commitment, determination and
unity to address issues and improve performance.
While the quantitative assessment generated a near-target score,
the remuneration committee also considered broader qualitative
factors. These included the findings of internal and external reports
on operational and safety issues in the US business. On balance, the
committee judged that bonus levels should be reduced by 50% from the
level they would otherwise have been. The resulting annual bonuses are
set out in the table above.
2004-2006 share element result
For the 2004-2006 share element of the Executive Directors' Incentive
Plan (EDIP), BP's performance was assessed in terms of shareholder
return against the market (SHRAM), ROACE and earnings per share (EPS)
growth. BP's three-year SHRAM was measured against the companies
in the FTSE All World Oil & Gas Index. Companies within the index are
weighted according to their market capitalization at the beginning of the
three-year period in order to give greatest emphasis to oil majors. BP's
ROACE and EPS growth were measured against ExxonMobil, Shell, Total
and Chevron. Based on a performance assessment of 60 points out of
200 (0 for SHRAM, 50 for ROACE and 10 for EPS growth), the committee
made awards of shares to executive directors as shown in the 2004-2006
columns in the table above.

Remuneration policy
Our remuneration policy for executive directors aims to ensure there
is a clear link between the company's purpose, the business plans and
executive reward, with pay varying with performance. In order to achieve
this, the policy is based on these key principles:
- The remuneration structure will support BP's aim to maximize long-term
shareholder value.
- The structure will reflect a fair system of reward for all the participants.
- The remuneration committee will determine the overall amount of each
component of remuneration, taking into account the success of BP and
the competitive environment.
- The majority of executive remuneration will be linked to the
achievement of demanding performance targets, independently
set to support the creation of long-term shareholder value.
- There will be a quantitative and qualitative assessment of performance,
with the remuneration committee making an informed judgement
within a framework approved by shareholders.
- Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the group will be taken
into account, especially in setting annual salary increases.
- Executives will develop a significant personal shareholding in order to
align their interests with those of shareholders.
- The remuneration policy for executive directors will be reviewed
regularly, independently of executive management, and will set the
tone for the remuneration of other senior executives.
- The remuneration committee will actively seek to understand
shareholder preferences.
- Remuneration policy and practice will be as transparent as possible.
Executive directors' total remuneration consists of salary, annual bonus,
long-term incentives, pensions and other benefits. The remuneration
committee reviews this structure regularly to ensure it is achieving its
aims. In 2006, well over three-quarters of executive directors' total
potential remuneration was performance-related, in line with the target.
The same will be true for potential remuneration in 2007.
Salary
The remuneration committee reviews salaries annually, taking into
account other large Europe-based global companies and companies in the
US oil and gas sector. These groups are each defined and analysed by the
committee's independent remuneration advisers. The committee makes a
judgement on salary levels based on its assessment of market conditions
and the external advice.
Annual bonus
All executive directors are eligible to take part in an annual performance-
based bonus scheme. The remuneration committee sets bonus targets
and levels of eligibility each year.
The target level for 2007 is 120% of base salary. In normal
circumstances, the maximum payment for substantially exceeding
performance targets will continue to be 150% of base salary.
Annual bonus awards for 2007 will be based on a mix of demanding
financial targets, based on the annual plan and the leadership objectives
set at the beginning of the year. The weightings on annual bonus
targets are:
- 50% Financial metrics from the annual plan, principally EBITDA,
cash costs and capital expenditure.
- 30% Non-financial measures focusing on health, safety and the
environment; growth; and reputation.
- 20% Individual performance against leadership objectives and against
living the values of the group (incorporating BP's code of conduct).
The remuneration committee will also review carefully the underlying
performance of the group in the light of the five-year business plan and
will look at competitors' results, analysts' reports and the views of the
chairmen of other BP board committees when assessing results.
In exceptional circumstances, the remuneration committee can decide
to award bonuses moderately above the maximum level. The committee
can also decide to reduce bonuses where this is warranted, and in
exceptional circumstances bonuses could be reduced to zero. We
have a duty to shareholders to use our discretion in a reasonable
and informed manner, acting in the best interests of the company,
and also to be accountable and transparent in our decisions. Any
significant exercise of discretion will be explained in the subsequent
directors' remuneration report.
Group chief executive
As for previous years, the target level for 2007 for Lord Browne is 130%
of base salary, with a maximum payment for substantially exceeding
performance targets of 165% of base salary. Lord Browne will retire on
31 July 2007. His annual bonus award for 2007 will be pro-rated to reflect
his service during the financial year up to his retirement in July.
Long-term incentives
Each executive director participates in the EDIP. It has three elements:
shares, share options and cash. The remuneration committee did not use
either share option or cash elements in 2006 and would only do so in
2007 in exceptional circumstances. This section describes the share
element. We intend that executive directors will continue to receive
performance shares under the EDIP, barring unforeseen circumstances,
until it expires or is renewed in 2010.
Policy
The remuneration committee can award shares to executive directors that
will only vest to the extent that demanding performance conditions are
satisfied at the end of a three-year period. The maximum number of these
performance shares that can be awarded to an executive director in any
year is at the discretion of the remuneration committee, but will not
normally exceed 5.5 times base salary (7.5 times base salary in the case
of the group chief executive).
In exceptional circumstances, the committee also has an overriding
discretion to reduce the number of shares that vest or to decide that no
shares vest.
The compulsory retention period will also be decided by the committee
and will not normally be less than three years. Together with the
performance period, this gives executive directors a six-year incentive
structure, as shown in the timeline below, which is designed to ensure
their interests are aligned with those of shareholders.

Performance period Retention period
Release Vesting Award
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where shares vest under awards made in 2007 and future years, the
executive director will receive additional shares representing the value
of the reinvested dividends.
The committee's policy continues to be that each executive director
should hold shares equivalent in value to five times his or her base salary
within five years of appointment as an executive director. This policy is
reflected in the terms of the EDIP, as shares awarded will only be
released at the end of the three-year retention period, described below,
if these minimum shareholding guidelines are met.
Performance conditions
For performance share awards in 2007, the performance conditions will
continue to relate to BP's total shareholder return (TSR) compared with
other oil majors - ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and Chevron - over a three-
year period. We have the discretion to alter this comparison group if
circumstances change, for example, if there are significant consolidations
in the industry.
We consider this relative TSR to be the most appropriate measure
of performance for the purpose of long-term incentives for executive
directors. It best reflects the creation of shareholder value while
minimizing the impact of sector-specific effects such as the oil price.
TSR is calculated as share price performance over the relevant period,
assuming dividends are reinvested. All share prices are averaged over the BP Annual Report and Accounts 2006 71
three months before the beginning and end of the performance period.
They are measured in US dollars. At the end of the performance period,
the companies' TSRs will be ranked. Executive directors' performance
shares will vest at 100%, 70% and 35% if BP is ranked first, second
or third respectively; none will vest if BP is in fourth or fifth place.
As the comparator group is small and as the oil majors' underlying
businesses are broadly similar, a simple ranking could sometimes distort
BP's underlying business performance relative to the comparators.
The committee is therefore able to exercise discretion in a reasonable
and informed manner to adjust the vesting level upwards or downwards
to reflect better the underlying health of BP's business. This would be
judged by reference to a range of measures including ROACE, growth
in EPS, reserves replacement and cash flow. The need to exercise
discretion is most likely to arise when the TSR of some companies is
clustered, so that a relatively small difference in TSR performance would
produce a major difference in vesting levels.
The remuneration committee will explain any adjustments in the
next directors' remuneration report following the vesting, in line with its
commitment to transparency.
Group chief executive
As noted above, as group chief executive, Lord Browne is eligible for
performance share awards of up to 7.5 times his base salary. While the
largest part of this is related to TSR, the committee has decided that
up to two times base salary should be based on long-term leadership
measures. These focus on sustaining BP's financial, strategic and
organizational health. They include, among other measures, maintenance
of BP's performance culture and the continued development of BP's
business strategy, executive talent and internal organization. As with
the TSR element, this element will be assessed over a three-year
performance period.
The remuneration committee has agreed that Lord Browne will be
granted a share award under the 2007-2009 plan on the above basis.
The performance targets for this award (and those granted to him on
the same basis in 2005 and 2006) will be assessed by the remuneration
committee at the end of the three-year performance period that applies
to each award. The actual number of shares received will depend on the
extent to which relevant performance conditions are satisfied.
Pensions
Executive directors are eligible to participate in the appropriate pension
schemes applying in their home countries. Additional details are given
on page 74.
UK directors
UK directors are members of the regular BP Pension Scheme. The core
benefits under this scheme are non-contributory. They include a pension
accrual of 1/60th of basic salary for each year of service, up to a
maximum of two-thirds of final basic salary and a dependant's benefit of
two-thirds of the member's pension. The scheme pension is not
integrated with state pension benefits.
The rules of the BP Pension Scheme have recently been amended
such that the normal retirement age is 65. Scheme members can retire
on or after age 60 without reduction. Special early retirement terms apply
to pre-1 December 2006 service for members with long service as at
1 December 2006.
In April 2006, the UK government made important changes to the
operation and taxation of pensions. The remuneration committee decided
to deliver pension benefits in excess of the new lifetime allowance of
 1.5 million set by the legislation via an unapproved, unfunded pension
arrangement paid by the company direct.
US directors
Dr Grote participates in the US BP Retirement Accumulation Plan (US
plan), which features a cash balance formula. The US plan took its current
form on 1 July 2000. Pension benefits are provided through a combination
of tax-qualified and non-qualified benefit restoration plans, consistent with
US tax regulations as applicable.
The Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefit (supplemental plan) is
a non-qualified top-up arrangement that became effective on 1 January
2002 for US employees above a specified salary level. The benefit formula
is 1.3% of final average earnings, which comprise base salary and bonus
in accordance with standard US practice (and as specified under the
qualified arrangement), multiplied by years of service. There is an
offset for benefits payable under all other BP qualified and non-qualified
pension arrangements. This benefit is unfunded and therefore paid from
corporate assets.
Dr Grote is eligible to participate under the supplemental plan. His
pension accrual for 2006, shown in the table on page 74, includes the
total amount that could become payable under all plans.
Other benefits
Executive directors are eligible to participate in regular employee benefit
plans and in all-employee share saving schemes and savings plans
applying in their home countries. Benefits in kind are not pensionable.
Expatriates may receive a resettlement allowance for a limited period.

Subsequent to 31 December 2006, Dr Hayward's salary was increased to  750,000
and Mr Inglis' salary, on appointment to the board, to  425,000.
When Lord Browne retires on 31 July 2007, he will become entitled to a
payment equal to the aggregate of 12 months' base salary at that date, his
target annual bonus level (130% of base salary) and  90,000 in respect of
fringe benefits. In accordance with the committee's policy, the payment will
be made in four quarterly instalments (the first payable in November 2007)
and each instalment will be reduced by an amount equal to any of Lord
Browne's replacement earnings for the quarter in question, to the extent
that such earnings exceed one-third of the relevant quarterly instalment.
Service contracts are expressed to expire at a normal retirement age
of 60 (subject to age discrimination). The contracts have a notice period
of one year.
The service contracts of Dr Allen, Mr Conn, Dr Hayward and
Mr Manzoni may be terminated by the company at any time with
immediate effect, on payment in lieu of notice equivalent to one year's
salary, or the amount of salary that would have been paid if the contract
had terminated on the expiry of the remainder of the notice period.
Dr Grote's contract is with BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. He is seconded
to BP p.l.c. under a secondment agreement of 7 August 2000, which had
an unexpired term of one year on 31 December 2006. The secondment
can be terminated by one month's notice by either party and terminates
automatically on the termination of Dr Grote's service contract.
There are no other provisions for compensation payable on early
termination of the above contracts. In the event of the early termination
of any of the contracts by the company, other than for cause (or under a
specific termination payment provision), the relevant director's then-current
salary and benefits would be taken into account in calculating any liability of
the company.
Since January 2003, new service contracts have included a provision
to allow for severance payments to be phased, when appropriate. The
committee will also consider mitigation to reduce compensation to a
departing director, when appropriate to do so. 72
Part 2 - Non-executive directors' remuneration
Policy
The board sets the level of remuneration for all non-executive directors
within the limit approved from time to time by shareholders. The
remuneration of the chairman is set by the board rather than the
remuneration committee, in line with BP's governance policies, as we
believe the performance of the chairman is a matter for the board as a
whole rather than any one committee. The board's policy is that non-
executive remuneration should be consistent with recognized
best-practice standards. Non-executive directors are encouraged to
establish a holding in BP shares broadly related to one year's base fee.
Annual fee structure
Non-executive directors' remuneration consists of the following elements:
- Cash fees, paid monthly, with increments for positions of additional
responsibility, reflecting workload and potential liability.
- A fixed allowance, currently  5,000, for transatlantic or equivalent
inter-continental travel to attend a board or board committee meeting
(excluding the chairman).
- Reasonable travel and related business expenses.
No share or share option awards are made to any non-executive
director in respect of service on the board.
The fees were reviewed in 2005 by an ad hoc board committee and
were increased with effect from 1 January 2005 to reflect the change
in workload and global market rates for independent or non-executive
directors since the previous review in 2002. There was no increase
in 2006.

fee. In addition, he is eligible for committee chairmanship fees and the transatlantic
attendance allowance. The deputy chairman is currently chairman of the audit
committee.
c
This allowance is payable to non-executive directors undertaking transatlantic or
equivalent intercontinental travel for the purpose of attending a board meeting or
board committee meeting.
Superannuation gratuities
In accordance with the company's long-standing practice, non-executive
directors who retired from the board after at least six years' service are, at
the time of their retirement, eligible for consideration for a superannuation
gratuity. The board is authorized to make such payments under the
company's Articles of Association. The amount of the payment is
determined at the board's discretion (having regard to the director's
period of service as a director and other relevant factors).
In 2002, the board revised its policy with respect to superannuation
gratuities so that: (i) non-executive directors appointed to the board after
1 July 2002 would not be eligible for consideration for such a payment;
and (ii) while non-executive directors in service at 1 July 2002 would
remain eligible for consideration for a payment, service after that date
would not be taken into account by the board in considering the amount
of any such payment.
The board made superannuation gratuity payments during the year
to the following former directors: Mr Miles  46,000 (who retired in
April 2006) and Mr Wilson  21,000 (who resigned from the board in
February 2006). These payments were in line with the policy
arrangements agreed in 2002 (outlined above).

Based on the current fee structure, the table above shows the 2006
remuneration of each non-executive director.
Non-executive directors have letters of appointment that recognize
that, subject to the Articles of Association, their service is at the
discretion of shareholders. All directors stand for re-election at each AGM.
Non-executive directors of Amoco Corporation
Non-executive directors who were formerly non-executive directors of
Amoco Corporation have residual entitlements under the Amoco Non-
Employee Directors' Restricted Stock Plan. Directors were allocated
restricted stock in remuneration for their service on the board of Amoco
Corporation prior to its merger with BP in 1998. On merger, interests in
Amoco shares in the plan were converted into interests in BP ADSs. The
restricted stock will vest on the retirement of the non-executive director
at the age of 70 (or earlier at the discretion of the board). Since the
merger, no further entitlements have accrued to any director under
the plan. The residual interests, as interests in a long-term incentive
scheme, are set out in the table below, in accordance with the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.

No awards were granted and no awards lapsed during the year. The awards were
granted over Amoco stock prior to the merger but their notional weighted average
market value at the date of grant (applying the subsequent merger ratio of 0.66167
of a BP ADS for every Amoco share) was $27.87 per BP ADS.
b
For the purposes of the regulations, the date on which the director retires from
the board at or after the age of 70 is the end of the qualifying period. If the director

Mr Wilson resigned from the board on 28 February 2006. Mr Wilson had received
awards of Amoco shares under the plan between 1 November 1993 and 28 April
1998 prior to the merger. These interests had been converted into BP ADSs at the
time of the merger. In accordance with the terms of the plan, the board exercised its
discretion over this award on 11 May 2006 and the shares vested on that date
(when the BP ADS market price was $76.07) without payment by him. BP Annual Report and Accounts 2006 73
Part 3 - Additional statutory
and other disclosures
Remuneration committee
All the members of the committee are independent non-executive
directors. Throughout this year, Dr Julius (chairman), Mr Bryan, Mr Davis,
Sir Tom McKillop and Sir Ian Prosser were members. Lord Browne was
consulted on matters relating to the other executive directors who report
to him and on matters relating to the performance of the company;
he was not present when matters affecting his own remuneration
were discussed.
Tasks
The remuneration committee's tasks are:
- To determine, on behalf of the board, the terms of engagement and
remuneration of the group chief executive and the executive directors
and to report on these to the shareholders.
- To determine, on behalf of the board, matters of policy over which
the company has authority regarding the establishment or operation
of the company's pension scheme of which the executive directors
are members.
- To nominate, on behalf of the board, any trustees (or directors of
corporate trustees) of the scheme.
- To monitor the policies being applied by the group chief executive in
remunerating senior executives who are not executive directors.
Constitution and operation
Each member of the remuneration committee (named on page 80) is
subject to annual re-election as a director of the company. The board
considers all committee members to be independent (see page 77).
They have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the
committee's decisions.
The committee met five times in the period under review. There was
a full attendance record except for Mr Davis, who was unable to attend
one meeting. Mr Sutherland, as chairman of the board, attended all the
committee meetings.
The committee is accountable to shareholders through its annual
report on executive directors' remuneration. It will consider the outcome
of the vote at the AGM on the directors' remuneration report and take
into account the views of shareholders in its future decisions. The
committee values its dialogue with major shareholders on remuneration
matters.
Advice
Advice is provided to the committee by the company secretary's office,
which is independent of executive management and reports to the
chairman of the board. Mr Aronson, an independent consultant, is the
committee's secretary and special adviser. Advice was also received
from Mr Jackson, the company secretary.
The committee also appoints external advisers to provide specialist
advice and services on particular remuneration matters. The
independence of the advice is subject to annual review.
In 2006, the committee continued to engage Towers Perrin as its
principal external adviser. Towers Perrin also provided limited ad hoc
remuneration and benefits advice to parts of the group, principally
changes in employee share plans and some market information
on pay structures. The committee continued to engage Kepler Associates
to advise on performance measurement. Kepler Associates also
provided performance data and limited ad hoc advice on performance
measurement to the group.
Freshfields Bruckhaus Derringer provided legal advice on specific
matters to the committee, as well as providing some legal advice to
the group.
Ernst & Young reviewed the calculations on the financial-based targets
that form the basis of the performance-related pay for executive directors,
that is, the annual bonus and share element awards described on page 69,
to ensure they met an independent, objective standard. They also
provided audit, audit-related and taxation services for the group.

Group chief executive
As stated in previous years' reports, Lord Browne is eligible for consideration for an ex-gratia lump sum superannuation payment equivalent to one
year's base salary. This is in line with the company's past practice for directors retiring on or after age 55 having accrued at least 30 years' service. The
remuneration committee has approved the payment of this sum to Lord Browne immediately following his retirement. This payment will be in addition
to his pension entitlements under the scheme described above. No other executive director is eligible for consideration for an ex-gratia payment on
retirement because in 1996 the remuneration committee decided that appointees to the board after that time should cease to be eligible.
