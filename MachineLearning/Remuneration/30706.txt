Part 1: Summary
Dear Shareholder
This year has been a period of transition for the group and so the
long-standing principles that guide the remuneration committee have
been particularly in evidence. These centre on a demanding performance
link, for the majority of executive directors' remuneration, to support
the creation of long-term shareholder value; and the application of
informed judgement by the committee, using both quantitative and
qualitative assessments, to ensure a fair and appropriate reward
for the executive directors.
Executive changes
Key among the transitions was the appointment of Dr Hayward as
group chief executive. Mr Inglis was appointed chief executive of our
exploration and production business and Mr Conn assumed the role of
chief executive of our refining and marketing business. They, along with
Dr Grote in his continuing role as chief financial officer, make up the new
top team for the company. The committee considered both the scale and
importance of their roles as well as the operating style of the new team
in reviewing their remuneration during the year. Dr Hayward's salary
was increased to  950,000 per annum and the salary of both Mr Inglis
and Mr Conn was set at  650,000 per annum. Dr Grote's salary was
increased to $1,300,000 per annum. All will have a target bonus
opportunity of 120% of salary and long-term performance share awards
of 5.5 times salary. These performance shares only vest to the extent
that demanding performance conditions are met. In addition to these
ongoing plans, Mr Inglis and Mr Conn were each recently granted
one-off retention awards in the form of restricted shares to a value of
 1,500,000. These will vest in equal tranches after three and five years,
subject to their continued service and satisfactory performance.
Both Lord Browne and Mr Manzoni left the company during the year.
Lord Browne remained eligible for a lump sum ex gratia superannuation
payment equal to one year's salary but, in light of his resignation,
received no other compensation on his retirement. Mr Manzoni received
one year's salary in line with his contractual entitlement. Both were
eligible for a pro-rata bonus for 2007, reflecting the results achieved as
well as their time employed during the year. Both retain full participation
in the 2005-2007 and 2006-2008 share element but forfeit any
participation in the 2007-2009 plan. They both retain outstanding share
options granted in earlier years.
2007 performance
Overall performance for the year was constrained by the continuing
impact of past operating challenges. Bonuses awarded reflect the
balance of somewhat disappointing financial results coupled with
good progress on non-financial measures, including health, safety
and environment (HSE), and very committed efforts by the executive
directors to resolve past issues, advance the forward agenda and deliver
results. These are set out in the summary table opposite, along with
all remuneration paid to executive directors in 2007.
The impact of past operating problems affected the Executive
Directors' Incentive Plan (EDIP) share element. Shares vest in this
element based principally on the total shareholder return (TSR) relative
to the oil majors over the three-year performance period. Performance
failed to meet satisfactory levels and consequently no shares will vest
in the 2005-2007 plan. Although Lord Browne similarly did not receive
shares under the main 2005-2007 plan, around 15% of the shares of
the separate leadership portion vested.
Review of policy
With a new top team in place and having come through a testing time
in terms of company performance, the committee decided to review
remuneration policy during the year. The key area of review was the
performance conditions applied to the EDIP share element. In particular,
the committee considered whether additional performance measures or
non-financial measures, such as health and safety indicators, should be
included. The review included consultation with major shareholders and
a comparison with other companies' remuneration policies. The review
reinforced our confidence in the current plan, approved by shareholders
in 2005, in particular in the flexibility it gives us to exercise our judgement
with regard to underlying performance and non-financial indicators
without being formulaic. No changes to the policy are planned.
For 2008, therefore, our policy is as follows:
- Salary Salaries are reviewed annually, based on independent advice,
with regard to comparator companies and market conditions.
- Annual bonus  On-target' bonus is set at 120% of salary. The normal
maximum bonus, also unchanged, is 150% of salary but, as in past
years, the committee may in exceptional circumstances award bonus
above that level if deemed justified by performance. Bonus for 2008
will reflect the business priorities of safety, people and performance
as articulated by Dr Hayward. Of the 120%  on-target' bonus, 50 will
be measured on financial results, principally earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), return on average
capital employed and cash flow; 25 will be based on safety as
assessed by the safety, ethics and environment assurance committee
(SEEAC); 25 on people, behaviour and values; and 20 on individual
performance, which will primarily reflect relevant operating results
and leadership.
- EDIP The share element will provide the primary long-term
remuneration vehicle. Shares will be awarded to a level of 5.5 times
salary for each executive director. These will vest after three years to
the extent that performance relative to the other oil majors merits it.
Performance is measured principally on TSR versus ExxonMobil, Shell,
Total and Chevron. 100% of shares vest if first, 70% if second, 35%
if third and nothing if fourth or fifth. The committee will also apply
informed judgement, looking at overall performance in determining
the final vesting level. Shares that vest must be retained for a further
three years before being released to the executive director. In
addition, each executive director is expected to build a significant
personal shareholding in BP.
- Pensions Executive directors are eligible to participate in the
appropriate pension schemes applying to their home countries.
With this policy, the majority of executive directors' target
remuneration is performance-based. Recognizing that unforeseen
developments mean no remuneration structure is perfect, the committee
will continue to apply its judgement in the implementation of the policy
so as to reflect shareholders' interests and also engage and retain our
talented team of executives.

Part 2: Executive directors' remuneration
2007 remuneration
Salary increases
During the year, salary increases were awarded reflecting promotions
and changed job responsibilities as well as regular market movement.
The remuneration committee seeks to position salaries competitively
relative to appropriate comparators in Europe and the US oil and gas
sectors, as well as to reflect the operating style of the  team at the
top'. At the end of 2007, annual salaries were as follows: Dr Hayward
 950,000, Dr Allen  510,000, Mr Conn  650,000, Dr Grote $1,300,000
and Mr Inglis  650,000.
Annual bonus result
Performance measures and targets were set at the beginning of the year
and formed the main basis for determining the 2007 bonus. Financial
measures accounted for 50% weighting and focused on EBITDA, cash
costs and capital expenditure. Non-financial measures carried 30%
weight and centred on HSE performance, growth and reputation.
Individual performance, including segment deliverables and living the
values of the group, made up the final 20%.
Financially, underlying EBITDA results reflected a favourable price
environment but also some performance shortfall, related largely to
reduced refining availability at Whiting and Texas City, as well as delays
in start-up of some major exploration and production projects. Overall it
was below expectation. Cash costs were marginally above plan, largely
due to higher expenditures in refining, especially Texas City. Capital
expenditure was near plan, despite higher than expected sector inflation.
On the non-financial side, safety was maintained as the highest priority
of the executive top team. Significant progress was made on many
aspects of process safety, ranging from development and testing of a
process safety index, addressing specific recommendations of the Baker
Panel, implementing a holistic operating management system (OMS) and
ensuring clear accountability. Personal safety metrics and greenhouse
gas emissions were also good.
Growth was led by upstream, which had the strongest year of
resource access since the early 1990s and reserves replacement in
excess of 100%. Refinery throughput was below target, due to reduced
availability at Texas City and Whiting. BP Alternative Energy met plan
targets, achieving some 40% growth compared with 2006.
External assessments indicate that significant progress has been
made to rebuild the company's reputation.
In terms of individual performance during a transition year, the
committee recognized very high levels of personal and team effort
to produce results, resolve past issues and position the company
for future success.
The strong individual performances, combined with above-target
non-financial and near-target financial performance, led the committee to
award bonuses generally around or just above target, as set out in the
summary table on page 65.
2005-2007 share element result
Performance for the 2005-2007 share element was assessed relative
to the TSR of the company compared with the other oil majors -
ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and Chevron. BP's TSR result, reflecting past
operating problems, was last relative to the other majors. The committee
also reviewed the underlying business performance relative to
competitors, including financial (ROACE, EPS, cash flow etc.) and non-
financial (HSE etc.) indicators. While this showed some areas of strong
performance, the committee's overall assessment, considering both the
TSR result and the underlying performance, was that performance failed
to meet satisfactory levels and consequently no shares will vest in the
Plan for 2005-2007.
Lord Browne also held an award under the 2005-2007 share element
related to long-term leadership measures. These focused on sustaining
BP's financial, strategic and organizational health. Performance relative
to the award was assessed by the chairman's committee and, based
on this assessment, 80,000 shares vested, representing about 15%
of the award.
Remuneration policy
Our remuneration policy for executive directors aims to ensure there
is a clear link between the company's purpose, its business plans and
executive reward, with pay varying with performance. In order to achieve
this, the policy is based on these key principles:
- The majority of executive remuneration will be linked to the
achievement of demanding performance targets, independently
set to support the creation of long-term shareholder value.
- The structure will reflect a fair system of reward for all the
participants.
- The remuneration committee will determine the overall amount of
each component of remuneration, taking into account the success
of BP and the competitive environment.
- There will be a quantitative and qualitative assessment of
performance, with the remuneration committee making an informed
judgement within a framework approved by shareholders.
- Remuneration policy and practice will be as transparent as possible.
- Executives will develop a significant personal shareholding in order
to align their interests with those of shareholders.
- Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the group will be taken
into account, especially in setting annual salary increases.
- The remuneration policy for executive directors will be reviewed
regularly, independently of executive management, and will set
the tone for the remuneration of other senior executives.
- The remuneration committee will actively seek to understand
shareholder preferences.
Executive directors' total remuneration consists of salary, annual
bonus, long-term incentives, pensions and other benefits. The
remuneration committee reviews this structure regularly to ensure
it is achieving its aims and did so in 2007.
The main part of the review centred on the share element of the EDIP.
The committee investigated alternative and additional measures to TSR,
in particular those representing underlying operational performance, and
also considered the inclusion of non-financial measures, most notably
those relating to HSE.
In the process of the review, input was sought from key institutional
investors and their representative bodies.
After thorough review, the committee concluded that, for the long-
term metrics, there was no  perfect' measure and, on balance, no strong
reason for change. TSR remains an appropriate measure to reflect
long-term shareholder value. The detailed rationale behind the current
scoring system, as set out in the notes to the resolution in 2005 that
was approved by shareholders, still remained relevant and valid. The
committee felt that this system gives an optimal balance of quantitative
assessment relative to oil major performance as well as the ability of
the committee to make qualitative evaluation of underlying business
performance, including non-financial factors (such as HSE). Finally,
the committee felt that, in BP's current circumstances, there is merit
in maintaining the stability of the plan.
Salary
The remuneration committee reviews salaries annually, taking into
account other large Europe-based global companies and companies in
the US oil and gas sector. These groups are each defined and analysed
by the committee's independent remuneration advisers. The committee
makes a judgement on salary levels based on its assessment of market
conditions and the external advice.
Annual bonus
All executive directors are eligible to take part in an annual performance-
based bonus scheme. The remuneration committee sets bonus targets
and levels of eligibility each year.
The target level for 2008 is 120% of base salary. In normal
circumstances, the maximum payment for substantially exceeding
performance targets will continue to be 150% of base salary.
66 Filename: U54368_doc4.3d Time: 14:49:45 Date: 25/02/08
Checksum: -801865243
Annual bonus awards for 2008 will be based on a mix of demanding
financial targets, based on the annual plan and the leadership objectives
set at the beginning of the year. The target-level bonus of 120% of base
salary is split as follows:
- 50% financial metrics from the annual plan, principally EBITDA, cash
costs and capital expenditure.
- 25% safety performance, including satisfactory and improving key
metrics as well as progress on OMS implementation.
- 25% people, including behaviour, values and culture.
- 20% individual performance, principally on relevant operating results
and personal leadership.
The remuneration committee will also review carefully the underlying
performance of the group in light of company business plans and will
look at competitors' results, analysts' reports and the views of the
chairmen of other BP board committees when assessing results.
In exceptional circumstances, the remuneration committee can decide
to award bonuses moderately above the maximum level. The committee
can also decide to reduce bonuses where this is warranted and, in
exceptional circumstances, bonuses could be reduced to zero. We
have a duty to shareholders to use our discretion in a reasonable and
informed manner, acting to promote the success of the company, and
also to be accountable and transparent in our decisions. Any significant
exercise of discretion will be explained in the subsequent directors'
remuneration report.
Long-term incentives
Each executive director participates in the EDIP. It has three elements:
shares, share options and cash. The remuneration committee did not use
either share option or cash elements in 2007 and does not intend to do
so in 2008. We intend that executive directors will continue to receive
performance shares under the EDIP, barring unforeseen circumstances,
until it expires or is renewed in 2010.
Policy for performance share awards
The remuneration committee can award shares to executive directors
that will only vest to the extent that demanding performance conditions
are satisfied at the end of a three-year period. The maximum number of
these performance shares that can be awarded to an executive director
in any year is at the discretion of the remuneration committee, but will
not normally exceed 5.5 times base salary.
In exceptional circumstances, the committee also has an overriding
discretion to reduce the number of shares that vest or to decide that no
shares vest.
The compulsory retention period will also be decided by the
committee and will not normally be less than three years. Together with
the performance period, this gives executive directors a six-year incentive
structure, as shown in the timeline below, which is designed to ensure
their interests are aligned with those of shareholders.
TIMELINE FOR 2008-2010 EDIP SHARE ELEMENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014
Performance period Retention period
Release Vesting Award
Where shares vest, the executive director will receive additional
shares representing the value of the reinvested dividends.
The committee's policy continues to be that each executive director
build a significant personal shareholding, with a target of shares
equivalent in value to five times his or her base salary within a reasonable
timeframe from appointment as an executive director. This policy is
reflected in the terms of the EDIP, as shares awarded will normally only
be released at the end of the three-year retention period, described
above, if these minimum shareholding guidelines are met.
Performance conditions
For performance share awards in 2008, the performance conditions
will continue to relate to BP's TSR compared with the other oil majors -
ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and Chevron - over three years. We have the
discretion to alter this comparison group if circumstances change - for
example, if there are significant consolidations in the industry.
We consider this relative TSR to be the most appropriate measure
of performance for the purpose of long-term incentives for executive
directors. It best reflects the creation of shareholder value while
minimizing the impact of sector-specific effects such as the oil price.
TSR is calculated as share price performance over the relevant period,
assuming dividends are reinvested. All share prices are averaged over
the three months before the beginning and end of the performance
period. They are measured in US dollars. At the end of the performance
period, the companies' TSRs will be ranked. Executive directors'
performance shares will vest at 100%, 70% and 35% if BP is ranked
first, second or third respectively; none will vest if BP is in fourth or
fifth place.
As the comparator group is small and as the oil majors' underlying
businesses are broadly similar, a simple ranking could sometimes distort
BP's underlying business performance relative to the comparators. The
committee is therefore able to exercise discretion in a reasonable and
informed manner to adjust the vesting level upwards or downwards to
reflect better the underlying health of BP's business. This would be
judged by reference to a range of measures including ROACE, growth
in EPS, reserves replacement and cash flow, as well as non-financial
reasons such as safety. The need to exercise discretion is most likely to
arise when the TSR of some companies is clustered, so that a relatively
small difference in TSR performance would produce a major difference
in vesting levels.
The remuneration committee will explain any adjustments in the next
directors' remuneration report following the vesting, in line with its
commitment to transparency.
Special retention awards
The committee reviews on an ongoing basis the overall approriateness
of the long-term incentive arrangements in ensuring the retention of key
executives. After careful review, the committee considered that it was
appropriate to strengthen the retention element of remuneration for
Mr Inglis and Mr Conn. Accordingly, the committee in February 2008
granted, on a one-off basis, a restricted stock award to both Mr Inglis
and Mr Conn of shares worth  1,500,000 each. These awards recognize
the importance of these individuals' leadership in re-establishing the
company's competitive performance as well as their personal
attractiveness for top jobs externally. The shares will vest, subject to
continued service, in equal tranches after three and five years. Vesting
of each tranche is dependent on the committee being satisfied, at
each vesting date, with the performance of the individual.
These retention awards have been granted under the EDIP, which
permits awards to be made, on an exceptional basis, subject to a
requirement of continued service over a specified period.
Pensions
Executive directors are eligible to participate in the appropriate pension
schemes applying in their home countries. Additional details are given
on page 68.
UK directors
UK directors are members of the regular BP Pension Scheme. The core
benefits under this scheme are non-contributory. They include a pension
accrualof1/60thofbasic salaryfor eachyearofservice,uptoa
maximum of two-thirds of final basic salary and a dependant's benefit
of two-thirds of the member's pension. The scheme pension is not
integrated with state pension benefits.
The rules of the BP Pension Scheme were amended in 2006 such
that the normal retirement age is 65. Prior to 1 December 2006, scheme
members could retire on or after age 60 without reduction. Special early
retirement terms apply to pre-1 December 2006 service for members
with long service as at 1 December 2006.

Pension benefits in excess of the individual lifetime allowance set by
legislation are paid via an unapproved, unfunded pension arrangement
provided directly by the company.
US directors
Dr Grote participates in the US BP Retirement Accumulation Plan
(US plan), which features a cash balance formula. Pension benefits are
provided through a combination of tax-qualified and non-qualified benefit
restoration plans, consistent with US tax regulations as applicable.
The Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefit (supplemental
plan) is a non-qualified top-up arrangement that became effective on
1 January 2002 for US employees above a specified salary level. The
benefit formula is 1.3% of final average earnings, which comprise base
salary and bonus in accordance with standard US practice (and as
specified under the qualified arrangement), multiplied by years of service.
There is an offset for benefits payable under all other BP qualified and
non-qualified pension arrangements. This benefit is unfunded and
therefore paid from corporate assets.
Dr Grote is eligible to participate under the supplemental plan. His
pension accrual for 2007, shown in the table below, includes the total
amount that could become payable under all plans.
Other benefits
Executive directors are eligible to participate in regular employee benefit
plans and in all-employee share saving schemes and savings plans
applying in their home countries. Benefits in kind are not pensionable.
Expatriates may receive a resettlement allowance for a limited period.
Mr Inglis is currently based in Houston, US, and the company provides
accommodation in London.

Service contracts are expressed to expire at a normal retirement age of
60 (subject to age discrimination). The contracts have a notice period of
one year.
The service contracts of UK directors may be terminated by the
company at any time with immediate effect on payment in lieu of notice
equivalent to one year's salary or the amount of salary that would have
been paid if the contract had terminated on the expiry of the remainder
of the notice period.
Dr Grote's contract is with BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. He is seconded
to BP p.l.c. under a secondment agreement of 7 August 2000, which
expires on 31 March 2010. The secondment can be terminated by one
month's notice by either party and terminates automatically on the
termination of Dr Grote's service contract.
There are no other provisions for compensation payable on early
termination of the above contracts. In the event of the early termination
of any of the contracts by the company, other than for cause (or under
a specific termination payment provision), the relevant director's then-
current salary and benefits would be taken into account in calculating
any liability of the company.
Since January 2003, new service contracts include a provision to allow
for severance payments to be phased, when appropriate. The committee
will also consider mitigation to reduce compensation to a departing
director, when appropriate to do so.
Directors leaving the board
2007
Both Lord Browne and Mr Manzoni, who were employed by the
company under service contracts dated 11 November 1993 and
29 January 2003 respectively, left the company during the year. Lord
Browne, who left on 1 May 2007, was eligible for an ex gratia lump
sum superannuation payment equal to one year's salary ( 1,575,000)
but, in light of his resignation, did not receive the compensation for
loss of office previously notified to shareholders. Mr Manzoni, who
left on 31 August 2007, was entitled to one year's salary ( 485,000)
as compensation on termination in accordance with his contractual
entitlement. Both individuals were eligible for a pro-rata bonus for 2007,
reflecting achievement of bonus targets and their period of employment
during the year. As regards long-term incentives, both individuals retain
their performance awards under the EDIP in respect of 2005-2007 and
2006-2008 share element and these will vest at the normal time to the
extent the performance targets are met. Both individuals forfeited their
participation in the 2007-2009 share element. Further details of these
awards are set out in the table on page 69. Both individuals retained their
outstanding share options, as set out in the table on page 70.
In connection with the shareholder derivative actions brought in the US
against the directors of the company, the company has agreed with the
plaintiffs in the Alaska action, with the consent of Lord Browne and
Mr Manzoni, to defer the release of certain amounts and preserved share
awards to those individuals (other than Lord Browne's ex gratia
superannuation payment) pending resolution of the action. The company
has agreed to pay the individuals simple interest at the rate of 6.5% in
respect of the period of deferral.
2008
As has been announced, Dr Allen will leave the company at the end
of March 2008. He will be entitled to one year's salary ( 510,000) as
compensation in accordance with his contractual entitlement, as well
as a pro-rata bonus for 2008 and continued full participation in the
2006-2008 and 2007-2009 share elements, according to the normal
rules of the plan.
Executive directors - external appointments
The board encourages executive directors to broaden their knowledge
and experience by taking up appointments outside the company. Each
executive director is permitted to accept one non-executive appointment,
from which they may retain any fee. External appointments are subject
to agreement by the chairman and must not conflict with a director's
duties and commitments to BP.
During the year, the fees received by executive directors for external
appointments were as follows:

Remuneration committee
All the members of the committee are independent non-executive
directors. Throughout the year, Dr Julius (chairman), Mr Davis,
Sir Tom McKillop and Sir Ian Prosser were members. Mr Bryan retired
as a member in April 2007. The group chief executive at the time was
consulted on matters relating to the other executive directors who report
to him and on matters relating to the performance of the company;
he was not present when matters affecting his own remuneration
were discussed.
Tasks
The remuneration committee's tasks are:
- To determine, on behalf of the board, the terms of engagement and
remuneration of the group chief executive and the executive directors
and to report on these to the shareholders.
- To determine, on behalf of the board, matters of policy over which
the company has authority regarding the establishment or operation
of the company's pension scheme of which the executive directors
are members.
- To nominate, on behalf of the board, any trustees (or directors of
corporate trustees) of the scheme.
- To review the policies being applied by the group chief executive in
remunerating senior executives other than executive directors to
ensure alignment and proportionality.
Constitution and operation
Each member of the remuneration committee is subject to annual re-
election as a director of the company. The board considers all committee
members to be independent (see page 75).
They have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders,
in the committee's decisions.
The committee met six times in the period under review. There was a
full attendance record. Mr Sutherland, as chairman of the board, attended
all the committee meetings.
The committee is accountable to shareholders through its annual
report on executive directors' remuneration. It will consider the outcome
of the vote at the AGM on the directors' remuneration report and
take into account the views of shareholders in its future decisions.
The committee values its dialogue with major shareholders on
remuneration matters.

Advice
Advice is provided to the committee by the company secretary's office,
which is independent of executive management and reports to the
chairman of the board. Mr Aronson, an independent consultant, is the
committee's secretary and special adviser. Advice was also received
from Mr Jackson, the company secretary.
The committee also appoints external advisers to provide specialist
advice and services on particular remuneration matters. The
independence of the advice is subject to annual review.
In 2007, the committee continued to engage Towers Perrin as its
principal external adviser. Towers Perrin also provided limited ad-hoc
remuneration and benefits advice to parts of the group, principally
changes in employee share plans and some market information on
pay structures.
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer provided legal advice on specific
matters to the committee, as well as providing some legal advice to
the group.
Ernst & Young reviewed the calculations on the financial-based
targets that form the basis of the performance-related pay for executive
directors, that is, the annual bonus and share element awards described
on page 66, to ensure they met an independent, objective standard. They
also provided audit, audit-related and taxation services for the group.
Part 3: Non-executive directors' remuneration
Policy
The board sets the level of remuneration for all non-executive directors
within a limit approved from time to time by shareholders. In accordance
with BP's board governance principles, the remuneration of the chairman
is set by the board rather than by the remuneration committee, as the
performance of the chairman is seen as a matter for the board as a
whole rather than any one committee.
Key elements of BP's non-executive director remuneration policy
include:
- Remuneration should be sufficient to attract and retain world-class
non-executive talent.
- Remuneration of non-executive directors is set by the board and
should be proportional to their contribution towards the interests
of the company.
- Remuneration practice should be consistent with recognized best
practice standards for non-executive directors' remuneration.
- Remuneration should be in the form of cash fees, payable monthly.
- Non-executive directors should not receive share options from the
company.
- Non-executive directors are encouraged to establish a holding in BP
shares of the equivalent value of one year's base fee.
Remuneration review
In 2007, an ad-hoc board committee was formed to review the structure
and quantum of BP non-executive directors' remuneration (having
previously been reviewed in 2004).
The committee considered the existing BP policy on non-executive
directors' remuneration and concluded that it should remain unchanged.
The committee evaluated non-executive director remuneration levels and
trends in both the UK and internationally, using a number of external data
sources. Outside the UK, particular focus was given to the remuneration
practices for non-executive directors in the US. The committee also
examined how the time commitment and workload for the board and its
committees had changed in the three years since the previous review.
Following the review, the committee proposed a revised structure
and level of remuneration for BP non-executive directors. Key changes
included:
- Increases to the fees for the chairman and deputy chairman/senior
independent director to reflect the market rates paid for those
positions in companies of comparable size to BP.
- The introduction of a flat fee for membership of the audit, the safety,
ethics and environment assurance, the remuneration and the
nomination committees (but not the chairman's committee) to reflect
the increased time commitment for board committees over the past
three years.
- An increase in the fee for the chairmen of the audit committee and
SEEAC to reflect the increase in time commitment and market rates
for those committees.
Consideration was also given to abolishing the transatlantic attendance
allowance, but the committee concluded that this would be to the
detriment of non-executives based outside Europe, who would not
otherwise be compensated for the additional travel time required for
UK meetings.
Changes to the structure and an increase to the level of non-executive
directors' fees were approved by the board and became effective
1 November 2007.

b
Appointed on 6 June 2007.
c
Also received a superannuation gratuity of  21,000.
No share or share option awards were made to any non-executive
director in respect of service on the board during 2007.
Non-executive directors have letters of appointment, which
recognize that, subject to the Articles of Association, their service
is at the discretion of shareholders. All directors stand for re-election
at each AGM.
Superannuation gratuities
Until 2002, BP maintained a long-standing practice whereby non-
executive directors who retired from the board after at least six years'
service were eligible for consideration for a superannuation gratuity.
The board was, and continues to be, authorized to make such payments
under the company's Articles of Association and the amount of the
payment is determined at the board's discretion, having regard to the
director's period of service as a director and other relevant factors.
In 2002, the board revised its policy with respect to superannuation
gratuities so that:
- Non-executive directors appointed to the board after 1 July 2002
would not be eligible for consideration for such a payment.
- While non-executive directors in service at 1 July 2002 would remain
eligible for consideration for a payment, service after that date
would not be taken into account by the board in considering the
amount of any such payment.
The board made a superannuation gratuity of  21,000 during the year
to Mr John Bryan, who retired in April 2007. This payment was in line
with the policy arrangements agreed in 2002 and outlined above.
Non-executive directors of Amoco Corporation
Non-executive directors who were formerly non-executive directors of
Amoco Corporation have residual entitlements under the Amoco Non-
Employee Directors' Restricted Stock Plan. Directors were allocated
restricted stock in remuneration for their service on the board of Amoco
Corporation prior to its merger with BP in 1998. On merger, interests in
Amoco shares in the plan were converted into interests in BP ADSs. The
restricted stock will vest on the retirement of the non-executive director
at the age of 70 (or earlier at the discretion of the board). Since the
merger, no further entitlements have accrued to any director under the
plan. The residual interests, as interests in a long-term incentive scheme,
are set out in the table below, in accordance with the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.

J H Bryan 5,546 5 October 2006
a
No awards were granted and no awards lapsed during the year. The awards were
granted over Amoco stock prior to the merger but their notional weighted average
market value at the date of grant (applying the subsequent merger ratio of 0.66167
of a BP ADS for every Amoco share) was $27.87 per BP ADS.
b
For the purposes of the regulations, the date on which the director retires from the
board at or after the age of 70 is the end of the qualifying period. If the director
retires prior to this date, the board may waive the restrictions.
c
Mr Bryan retired from the board on 12 April 2007. He had received awards of
Amoco shares under the plan between 25 April 1989 and 28 April 1998 prior to
the merger. These interests had been converted into BP ADSs at the time of the
merger. In accordance with the terms of the plan, the board exercised its discretion
over this award on 12 April 2007 and the shares vested on that date (when the BP
ADS market price was $66.79) without payment by him.
Past directors
Mr Miles (who was a non-executive director of BP until April 2006) was
appointed as a director and non-executive chairman of BP Pension
Trustees Limited in October 2006 for a term of three years. During 2007,
he received  150,000 for this role.
This directors' remuneration report was approved by the board and
signed on its behalf by David J Jackson, Company Secretary, on
22 February 2008.
