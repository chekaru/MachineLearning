Executive directors' remuneration
Remuneration committee
During the year the committee met seven times, and was made up of the 
following independent non-executive directors:
Mr Antony Burgmans (chairman from 2011 Annual General Meeting (AGM))
Mr George David
Mr Ian Davis
Dr DeAnne Julius was chairman of the committee until her retirement at 
the 2011 AGM. Mr Svanberg has attended all meetings. 
The group chief executive is consulted on matters relating to the other 
executive directors and senior executives who report to him and on 
matters relating to the performance of the company; neither he nor the 
chairman of the board participate in decisions on their own remuneration.
The committee's tasks are set out in the board governance principles:

remuneration of the group chief executive and the executive directors 
and to report on these to the shareholders.

company has authority regarding the establishment or operation of 
the company's pension schemes of which the executive directors are 
members.

corporate trustees) of such schemes.

group chief executive in remunerating senior executives other than 
executive directors to ensure alignment and proportionality.

for the chairman of the board.
The committee operates with a high level of independence. The board 
considers all committee members to be independent (see page 121). They 
have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the 
committee's decisions. Each member of the remuneration committee is 
subject to annual re-election as a director of the company.
Gerrit Aronson, an independent consultant, is the committee's 
independent adviser as well as secretary. He is engaged directly by the 
committee and not by executive management. Advice is also received 
from David Jackson, the company secretary, and from the company 
secretary's office, which is independent of executive management and 
reports to the chairman of the board. 
The committee also appoints external advisers to provide specialist advice 
and services on particular remuneration matters. The independence of 
the advice is subject to periodic review. In 2011, the committee continued 
to engage Towers Watson as its principal external adviser, primarily for 
market information. Towers Watson also provided other remuneration and 
benefits advice to parts of the group. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP 
provided legal advice on specific matters to the committee, as well as 
providing some legal advice to the group.
The committee values its dialogue with major shareholders  
on remuneration matters. The committee is accountable to shareholders 
through its annual report on executive directors' remuneration. It will 
consider the outcome of the vote at the AGM on the directors' 
remuneration report and take into account the views of shareholders in its 
future decisions. 
Executive directors' remuneration 2011
This section contains detail on executive directors' remuneration including 
salary, annual bonus and deferred bonus relating to 2011 and the share 
element for the performance period 2009-2011.
Salary
Mr Dudley's current salary of $1,700,000 was unchanged during 2011. 
As reported in last year's remuneration report, Mr Conn's and Dr Grote's 
salaries were increased in April 2011 to  730,000 and $1,442,000 
respectively, their first increase since 2008.
Annual bonus
Framework
All executive directors were eligible for an overall annual bonus, including 
deferral, of 150% of salary at target and a maximum of 225% of salary. 
Mr Dudley's annual bonus was based entirely on group results and 
Mr Conn's and Dr Grote's based 70% on group results and 30% on their 
respective segment and function.
Measures and targets for the annual bonus were set at the start of 
the year and were derived from the company's annual plan which, in turn, 
reflected its strategic priorities of reinforcing safety and risk management, 
rebuilding trust and reinforcing value creation. Targets are set so that 
meeting plan equates to on-target bonus.
At group level, the safety and risk management component 
included targets for recordable injury frequency, loss of primary 
containment and implementation of change programmes. Rebuilding trust 
was focused on external reputation as measured by external surveys and 
internal morale as measured by surveys. Finally, the value component 
included measures for underlying replacement cost profit, total cash 
costs, upstream operating cash and downstream profitability.
Mr Conn's Refining and Marketing segment similarly included 
targets for various safety measures, onstream availability, cost efficiency 
and profitability. Dr Grote's functional segment included measures for IST 
compliance, succession and divestments.
Apart from the specific measures set out, the committee may 
consider any other results that it deems relevant and apply its judgement 
in determining final bonus scores.

Outcomes for the year are summarized in the table below, with a more 
detailed explanation following.

Safety and risk management performance was strong with most targets 
exceeded. Loss of primary containment showed a 14% reduction on 
the number of incidents that occurred in the previous year and process 
safety related high potential incidents dropped 26% - both metrics 
are important indicators of process safety performance. Recordable 
injury frequency was better than target. A major change programme 
related to safety and risk management progressed very well. A central 
part of this was the completed implementation of the safety and 
operational risk function as a group-wide organization independent of line 
management. The change programme also included a major upstream 
reorganization, the introduction of a contractor management process, 
global rollout of a values and behaviours charter, implementation of a new 
individual performance and reward framework and completion of a risk 
management review.
Rebuilding trust showed some early signs of improvement but 
with clear work remaining to be done related to the long-term impact 
of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Independent external surveys 
reflect some recovery of trust and reputation in key markets as the 
year progressed. Internal employee alignment and morale remained 
encouragingly strong through a difficult period for the company. Employee 
satisfaction, as measured by survey, was near pre-Deepwater Horizon 
levels and a new  progress index' was implemented to track specific 
employee alignment related to the company's strategic priorities.
Rebuilding value measures were at or near target. Relative to 
target, underlying replacement cost profit was around 90% and total cash 
costs were 7% above. Upstream operating cash was some 3% better 
than target and Refining and Marketing profitability met its plan level. 
Refining and Marketing had a strong year overall with record earnings, 
good safety, and high utilization availability. 
Based on these results, the committee assessed group 
performance to be on-target. Mr Dudley therefore received a total bonus 
of 150% of salary including deferral, reflecting on-target performance. 
Mr Conn's total bonus of 165% of salary reflected achievements above 
target for the Refining and Marketing segment. Dr Grote's total bonus of 
150% of salary reflects on-target results at both group and function level.
Of the total bonuses referred to above, one-third is paid in cash, 
one-third is deferred on a mandatory basis and one-third is paid either 
in cash or voluntarily deferred at the individual's discretion. Amounts, as 
received by the individuals, are shown in the table on page 141.
Deferred bonus
One-third of the total bonus awarded to the executive directors is deferred 
into shares on a mandatory basis under the terms of the deferred bonus 
element. Their deferred shares are matched on a one-for-one basis 
and will vest in three years contingent on an assessment of safety and 
environmental sustainability over the three-year deferral period. 
Individuals may elect to defer an additional one-third into shares 
on the same basis as the mandatory deferral. All three executive directors 
chose to participate in the voluntary deferral. Again this is reflected in the 
table on page 141.
All deferred bonuses will be converted to shares based on the 
average price of BP shares over the three days following the company's 
announcement of 2011 results ( 4.91/share, $46.70/ADS).
2009-2011 share element
Framework
Performance shares were awarded to each executive director in early 
2009 with vesting after three years dependent on performance relative 
to measures reflecting the company's strategic priorities at the time. For 
the 2009 plan, vesting was based 50% on total shareholder return (TSR) 
versus the oil majors, and 50% on a balanced scorecard of underlying 
performance factors versus the same peers. The underlying performance 
factors were production growth, Refining and Marketing profitability, and 
underlying net income growth. The peer group included ExxonMobil, 
Shell, Total, Chevron and ConocoPhillips. Vesting was set at 100%, 70% 
and 35% for performance equivalent to first, second, and third rank 
respectively and none for fourth or fifth place.

Results
Reflecting the impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the TSR, 
production growth and net income growth measures for the three-year 
period 2009-2011 were all below the third place required for vesting.  
Refining and Marketing profitability was strong and based on a first 
place ranking achieved full vesting for that portion. Based on the agreed 
formula, this resulted in a vesting of 16.67% of the original award. 
The committee considered this result was a fair reflection of 
overall performance over the period. The resulting shares and value of the 
vesting is shown in the table on page 149.
2011 total remuneration outcomes
The charts below summarize the actual total remuneration outcome of 
2011 for each of the executive directors. 
The salary is the amount actually received during the year and  
the cash bonus reflects the portion of total bonus for 2011 that is  
received in cash. 
The deferred bonus reflects that portion of total bonus for 2011 
that is deferred, either on a mandatory or voluntary basis. The value 
shown is converted to shares, matched one-for-one and vests after three 
years contingent on the review of safety and environmental sustainability 
over the three years. 
Finally the share element portion reflects the value of the vesting 
that occurred for the 2009-2011 plan. These shares now enter a further 
three-year retention period before they are released to the individual. Directors' remuneration report

Remuneration policy
This section provides information on principles underlying the company's 
remuneration policy followed by an overview and an in-depth review of 
the policy.
Remuneration principles
Remuneration policy for executive directors is guided by key principles:
 Link to strategy - A substantial portion of executive remuneration 
should be linked to success in implementing the company's business 
strategy.
 Performance linked - The major part of total remuneration should vary 
with performance, with the largest elements share based, further 
aligning interests with shareholders.
 Long-term based - The structure of pay should reflect the long-term 
nature of BP's business and the significance of safety and 
environmental risks.
 Rigorous process - Performance conditions for variable pay should be 
set by the committee at the start of each year and assessed by the 
committee at the end of each performance period. Assessment should 
take into account material changes in the market environment 
(predominantly oil prices) and BP's competitive position (primarily 
vis- -vis other oil majors).
 Informed judgement - There should be both quantitative and qualitative 
assessments of performance with the committee making an informed 
judgement within a framework approved by shareholders.
 Fair treatment - The committee reviews the pay policy and levels for 
executives below board, as well as pay and conditions of employees 
throughout the group. These are considered when determining 
executive directors' remuneration. Salaries should be reviewed annually, 
in the context of the total quantum of pay, and taking into account both 
external market and internal company conditions.
 Personal shareholding - Executives should develop and be required to 
hold a significant shareholding as this represents the best way to align 
their interests with those of shareholders.
 Shareholder engagement - The remuneration committee will actively 
seek to understand shareholder preferences and be transparent in 
explaining its remuneration policy and practices.
These principles result in a remuneration policy that is directly linked to 
strategy, strongly performance related and heavily weighted towards long 
term.
The chart below shows the range of results possible for the group chief 
executive depending on performance outcomes. 
The on-target column assumes one-third of total bonus is deferred 
and matched, and the share element is valued at half the award. 
The maximum column assumes that two-thirds of the total bonus 
is deferred and matched, and full vesting of the share element.
Remuneration is strongly performance dependent:

 vesting based on additional safety and environment 
sustainability assessment.
 It is also heavily weighted towards the long term:

Remuneration policy overview
Component Policy 2012 application
Salary Base salaries should be competitive relative to relevant market 
peer groups.
Peer group for executive directors includes large European 
multinationals and the oil majors.
Pension and other 
benefits
Executive directors should participate in the normal pension and 
benefit schemes applying in their home countries. 
Both UK and US executive directors remain on defined benefit 
pension plans reflecting respective national norms. UK 
directors, as for all UK employees who exceed the annual 
allowance set by legislation, may receive a cash supplement in 
lieu of future service pension accrual.
Variable remuneration
Annual bonus Annual bonus should be based on performance relative to 
measures and targets reflecting the annual plan. 
Achieving plan results should equate to on-target bonus.
On-target bonus is set at 150% of salary for executive directors 
with a maximum of 225% of salary.
Bonus measures for 2012 are:
 Safety and risk management (30%).
 - Recordable injury frequency.
 - Loss of primary containment.
 -  Process safety related major incident announcements 
and high potential incidents.
 Rebuilding trust (20%).
 - External reputation.
 - Internal morale and alignment.
 Value creation (50%).
 - Operating cash flow.
 - Underlying replacement cost profit.
 - Total cash costs.
 - Gearing.
 - Divestments.
 - Upstream production efficiency.
 - Upstream major project delivery.
 - Refining and Marketing net income per barrel.
Deferred bonus A portion of annual bonus should be paid in shares and deferred 
to add long-term sustainability and shareholder alignment to 
short-term performance achievement.
One-third of annual bonus is deferred on a mandatory basis and 
a further one-third can be deferred on a voluntary basis.
All deferred shares are matched on a one-for-one basis.
All deferred and matched shares vest after three years 
contingent on an assessment of safety and environmental 
sustainability over the three-year deferral period.
Performance 
shares
A large portion of total remuneration for executive directors 
should be tied to the long-term performance of the company.
Shares to a value of 5.5 times salary for the group chief 
executive and 4 times salary for the other executive directors 
are normally awarded annually.
Vesting of the shares after three years is dependent on 
performance relative to measures reflecting the strategic 
priorities of the company.
Those shares that vest are held for an additional three-year 
retention period, after payment of tax on vesting.
The 2012-2014 share element will vest based equally on the 
following three performance metrics:
 Total shareholder return versus oil majors.
 Operating cash flow.
 Strategic imperatives.
 - Reserves replacement versus oil majors.
 - Process safety.
 - Rebuilding trust.
Personal 
shareholding 
in BP
Executive directors should develop significant personal 
shareholding in order to align their interests with shareholders.
Executive directors are required to develop, and maintain, a 
shareholding equivalent to five times salary, within a reasonable 
time of appointment. Directors' remuneration report
146    BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2011
Remuneration policy for 2012 in more depth
This section contains a more detailed explanation of the components of  
total remuneration for executive directors and how they will be 
implemented in 2012.
Salary
The committee normally reviews salaries annually, taking into account 
other large Europe-based global companies, other oil majors, and relevant 
US companies. It also considers salary treatment throughout the company 
when determining appropriate increases for executive directors.
Annual bonus
The group strategy provides the context for the company's annual plan, 
from which measures and targets are derived at the start of the year for 
senior managers including executive directors. Measures typically include 
a range of financial and operating metrics as well as those relating to 
safety and environment, and people.
At the end of each year, performance is assessed relative to the 
measures and targets established at the start of the year, adjusted for any 
material changes in the market environment (predominantly oil prices).  
Assessment includes both quantitative and qualitative views as well as 
input from the other committees on relevant aspects. The committee 
considers that this informed judgement is important to establishing a fair 
overall assessment.  
The chart below shows the average annual bonus result (before 
any deferral) and relative to an on-target level for executive directors for 
the current year and previous five.

% of target
For 2012, all executive directors will again be eligible for a total bonus 
(including deferral) of 150% of salary at target and 225% at maximum. 
Mr Dudley's bonus will be based entirely on group measures. Mr Conn, 
Dr Gilvary and Dr Grote will have 70% of their bonus based on group 
results and 30% on their respective segment or function.
The measures used to determine bonus results flow directly from 
the group's annual plan which reflects the strategic priorities of reinforcing 
safety and risk management, rebuilding trust, and reinforcing value 
creation. 
At group level, safety and risk management measures include 
recordable injury frequency, loss of primary containment and process 
related major incident announcements and high potential incidents. 
Rebuilding trust will be measured via surveys to assess both external 
reputation and internal staff alignment and morale. Restoring value will 
provide the dominant set of measures and include operating cash flow, 
underlying replacement cost profit, total cash costs, gearing, divestments, 
upstream production efficiency, major project delivery and Refining and 
Marketing profitability.
The Refining and Marketing segment will include specific safety 
metrics for the segment. Value metrics will include availability, efficiency, 
and profitability metrics, as well as divestments and major project 
delivery. Finance function measures will include divestments, gearing 
and major project delivery. The corporate business function will include 
profitability and compliance measures for IST and Alternative Energy.
In all cases, targets for each measure are set so that achieving plan 
levels of performance equates to an on-target bonus. As in past years, 
in addition to the specific bonus metrics, the committee will also review 
the underlying performance of the group in light of competitors' results, 
analysts' reports and the views of the chairmen of the other committees. 
Based on this broader view, the committee can decide to adjust bonuses 
where it is warranted and, in exceptional circumstances, to pay no 
bonuses.
Deferred bonus
The structure of deferred bonus, paid in shares, places increased focus 
on long-term alignment with shareholders, and reinforces the critical 
importance of maintaining high safety and environmental standards. It 
effectively translates the outcome of a portion of the annual performance 
bonus into a long-term plan with additional performance hurdles. As 
shown below, the results of 2012 will form the basis for determining the 
deferred bonus in 2013.

Performance period
For 2012, as last year, one-third of the annual bonus will be deferred 
into shares for three years and matched by the company on a one-for-
one basis. Under the rules of the plan, the average share price over 
the three days following announcement of full-year results is used to 
determine the number of shares. Both deferred and matched shares 
will vest in February 2016 contingent on an assessment of safety and 
environmental sustainability over the three-year deferral period. If the 
committee assesses that there has been a material deterioration in safety 
and environmental metrics, or there have been major incidents revealing 
underlying weaknesses in safety and environmental management, then it 
may conclude that shares should vest in part, or not at all. In reaching its 
conclusion, the committee will obtain advice from the safety, ethics and 
environment assurance committee (SEEAC).
Executive directors may voluntarily defer a further one-third of their 
annual bonus into shares, which will be capable of vesting, and will qualify 
for matching, on the same basis as set out above. Where shares vest, 
the executive director will also receive additional shares representing the 
value of the re-invested dividends.
Performance shares
The performance share element reflects the committee's policy that a 
large proportion of total remuneration is tied to long-term performance. 
Performance shares are awarded at the start of each year and vesting, 
after three years, is based on performance relative to measures and 
targets derived from the company's strategic priorities. Those shares 
that vest are then held for a further three-year retention period before 
being released to the executive after payment of tax on vesting. 
This gives executive directors a six-year incentive structure, which is 
designed to ensure their interests are aligned with those of shareholders. 
Where shares vest, the executive director will receive additional shares 
representing the value of the re-invested dividends.

Performance conditions
Performance conditions for the 2012-2014 share element will be aligned 
with the company's strategic agenda which continues to focus on value 
creation, reinforcing safety and risk management, and rebuilding trust. 
Vesting of shares will be based one-third on BP's total shareholder return 
(TSR) compared to the other oil majors, reflecting the central importance 
of restoring the value of the company. A further one-third will be based 
on the operating cash flow of the company, reflecting a central element 
of value creation. The final one-third will be based on a set of strategic 
imperatives; in particular, reserves replacement, process safety, and 
rebuilding trust. 
For the relative measures, TSR and the reserves replacement ratio, 
the comparator group will consist of ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and Chevron. 
This group can be altered if circumstances change, for example, if there is 
significant consolidation in the industry. While a narrow group, it continues 
to represent the comparators that both shareholders and management 
use in assessing relative performance. 
The TSR will be calculated as the share price performance over 
the three-year period, assuming dividends are re-invested. All share prices 
will be averaged over the three-month period before the beginning and 
end of the performance period. They will be measured in US dollars. 
The reserves replacement ratio is defined according to industry standard 
specifications and its calculation is audited. As in previous years, the 
methodology used for the relative measures will rank each of the five 
oil majors on each measure. Performance shares for each component 
will vest at levels of 100%, 70% and 35% respectively, for performance 
equivalent to first, second and third rank. No shares will vest for fourth or 
fifth place. 
Operating cash flow has been identified as a core strategic priority 
of the company. As has been communicated publicly, the target is to 
grow operating cash flow to $33 billion by 2014 based on $100/bbl oil 
price assumption. Below $31 billion, there will be no vesting under this 
component. Between $31 billion and $35 billion there will be a straight 
line vesting from 60% to 100% respectively. 
Finally the remaining strategic imperatives relating to process 
safety and rebuilding trust will be determined by a mixture of internal 
targets and external assessment. In the case of process safety, high 
potential incidents and major incident announcements will provide 
the key factual data as well as the input of the SEEAC. The rebuilding 
trust component will include both external and internal surveys that 
will be used by the committee, along with input from the other board 
committees, to judge performance. The results will be explained in 
subsequent directors' remuneration reports.
The committee considers that this combination of quantitative 
and qualitative measures reflects the long-term value creation priorities of 
the company as well as the key underpinnings for business sustainability. 
As in previous years, the committee may exercise its discretion, in a 
reasonable and informed manner, to adjust vesting levels upwards or 
downwards if it concludes that the formulaic approach does not reflect 
the true underlying health and performance of BP's business relative to its 
peers. It will explain any adjustments in the directors' remuneration report 
following vesting, in line with its commitment to transparency. 
Shareholding policy
The committee's policy, reflected in the Executive Directors' Incentive 
Plan (EDIP), continues to be that each executive director builds and 
maintains a significant personal shareholding in BP to create strong 
alignment with shareholders. Executive directors, under the policy, are 
required to build a share base equating to five times salary, within a 
reasonable time from their appointment. Each director's shareholding as 
at 31 December 2011 is set out on page 117. Directors' remuneration report
148    BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2011
Pensions
Executive directors are eligible to participate in the appropriate pension 
schemes applying in their home countries. Details are set out in the 
table below.
UK directors
UK directors are members of the regular BP pension scheme. The core 
benefits under this scheme are non-contributory. They include a pension 
accrual of 1/60th of basic salary for each year of service, up to a maximum 
of two-thirds of final basic salary and a dependant's benefit of two-thirds of 
the member's pension. The scheme pension is not integrated with state 
pension benefits.
The rules of the BP pension scheme were amended in 2006 such 
that the normal retirement age is 65. Prior to 1 December 2006, scheme 
members could retire on or after age 60 without reduction. Special early 
retirement terms apply to pre-1 December 2006 service for members with 
long service as at 1 December 2006.
Until the end of March 2011, pension benefits in excess of the 
individual lifetime allowance set by legislation were paid via an unapproved, 
unfunded pension arrangement provided directly by the company.
With the reduction in the annual allowance applicable to plans such 
as the BP pension scheme in 2011 the company reviewed the options 
available for employees who might wish to limit the increase in the value of 
their pension to remain within the new limit. To provide employees with 
flexibility, should they wish to limit the value of the increase in their 
pension to within the new limit, those impacted are able to elect a lower 
accrual rate and in addition receive a cash supplement so that the total cost 
to BP remains equivalent to the cost of providing 1/60th of basic salary. 
Some employees have had to cease pension accrual for future service to 
remain within the new annual allowance. For these employees the cash 
supplement is equal to 35% of basic salary.
Mr Conn has elected to cease to accrue pension benefits for future 
service in order to keep within the new annual allowance and has received 
a cash supplement of 35% of his basic salary from 1 April 2011. This is 
included in the remuneration table on page 141.
US directors
Mr Dudley and Dr Grote participate in the US BP retirement accumulation 
plan (US pension plan), which features a cash balance formula. Pension 
benefits are provided through a combination of tax-qualified and 
non-qualified benefit restoration plans, consistent with US tax regulations 
as applicable. 
BP also provides a supplemental executive retirement benefits plan 
(supplemental plan), which is a non-qualified arrangement that became 
effective on 1 January 2002 for US employees with salary above a 
specified salary grade level. Mr Dudley and Dr Grote are eligible to 
participate under the supplemental plan. The benefit formula is a target of 
1.3% of final average earnings (base pay plus bonus) for each year of 
service, inclusive of all other BP (US) qualified and non-qualified pension 
arrangements. This benefit is unfunded and therefore paid from corporate 
assets.
Mr Dudley retains the heritage Amoco retirement plan, which 
provides benefits on a final average pay formula of 1.67% of highest 
average earnings (base pay plus bonus in accordance with standard US 
practice) for each year of service, reduced by 1.5% of the primary social 
security benefit for each year of service. The highest benefit of the plans 
produced by the different formulas will be payable and this is currently the 
benefit determined under the Amoco heritage terms.
Their pension accrual for 2011, shown in the table below, takes into 
account the total amount that could be payable under relevant plans.
Other benefits

Service contracts
Service contracts have a notice period of one year and may be terminated 
by the company at any time with immediate effect on payment in lieu of 
notice equivalent to one year's salary or the amount of salary that would 
have been paid if the contract had been terminated on the expiry of the 
remainder of the notice period. Other than in the case of Dr Gilvary (who 
became a director on 1 January 2012), the service contracts are expressed 
to expire at a normal retirement age of 60 (subject to age discrimination).

Mr Dudley's contract is with BP Corporation North America Inc. He is 
seconded to BP p.l.c. under a secondment agreement of 15 April 2009, 
which expires on 15 April 2012. Dr Grote's contract is with BP Exploration 
(Alaska) Inc. He is seconded to BP p.l.c. under a secondment agreement 
of 7 August 2000, which expires at the date of the 2013 AGM. Both 
secondments can be terminated by one month's notice by either party and 
terminate automatically on the termination of their service contracts.
There are no other provisions for compensation payable on early 
termination of the above contracts. In the event of the early termination of 
any of the contracts by the company, other than for cause (or under a 
specific termination payment provision), the relevant director's then current 
salary and benefits would be taken into account in calculating any liability of 
the company. The committee will consider mitigation to reduce 
compensation to a departing director, when appropriate to do so.
Executive directors - external appointments
The board encourages executive directors to broaden their knowledge and 
experience by taking up appointments outside the company. Each 
executive director is permitted to accept one non-executive appointment, 
from which they may retain any fee. External appointments are subject to 
agreement by the chairman and reported to the board. Any external 
appointment must not conflict with a director's duties and commitments 
to BP.
During the year, the fees received by executive directors for 
external appointments were as follows:
