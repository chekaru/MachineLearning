Non-executive directors' 
remuneration
Policy
The board sets the level of remuneration for all non-executive directors 
within a limit approved from time to time by shareholders. Key elements of 
BP's policy on non-executive director remuneration include:

world-class non-executive talent.
 -executive directors is proposed by the chairman 
of the board and agreed by the board and should be proportional to their 
contribution towards the interests of the company.
 zed best 
practice standards for non-executive directors' remuneration.

 -executive directors should not receive share options from the 
company.
 -executive directors are encouraged to establish a holding in BP 
shares of the equivalent value of one-year's base fee.
Process
BP reviews the quantum and structure of chairman of the board and 
non-executive remuneration on an annual basis. The chairman's 
remuneration is reviewed by the remuneration committee, who makes a 
recommendation to the board; the chairman does not vote on his own 
remuneration. Non-executive director remuneration is reviewed by the 
chairman, who makes a recommendation to the board; non-executive 
directors do not vote on their own remuneration.
Following the 2011 review of non-executive remuneration, it was 
concluded that in light of wider economic circumstances, an increase 
would not be appropriate and therefore no adjustment would be made to 
fee levels. It was agreed that the policy of annual review would continue 
and that the transatlantic attendance allowance be renamed the 
intercontinental travel allowance to better reflect when the allowance 
is awarded.

This figure excludes a superannuation gratuity of  1,543.
While fees were held at 2010 levels, in 2011 actual fees paid to 
non-executive directors were affected by changes in chairmanship and 
committee membership and the number of intercontinental meetings for 
which an attendance allowance was paid.
No share or share option awards were made to any non-executive 
director in respect of service on the board during 2011.
Non-executive directors have letters of appointment which 
recognize that, subject to the Articles of Association, their service is at the 
discretion of shareholders. All directors stand for re-election at each AGM.
Superannuation gratuities
Until 2002, BP maintained a long-standing practice whereby non-executive 
directors who retired from the board after at least six years' service were 
eligible for consideration for a superannuation gratuity. The board was, and 
continues to be, authorized to make such payments under the company's 
Articles of Association and the amount of the payment is determined at the 
board's discretion, taking into consideration the director's period of service 
and other relevant factors.
In 2002, the board revised its policy with respect to superannuation 
gratuities so that:
 Non-executive directors appointed to the board after 1 July 2002 would 
not be eligible for consideration for such a payment.
 While non-executive directors in service at 1 July 2002 would remain 
eligible for consideration for a payment, service after that date would 
not be taken into account by the board in considering the amount of any 
such payment.
Dr DeAnne Julius who retired on 14 April 2011 was paid a superannuation 
gratuity of  1,543, in line with the policy arrangements agreed in 2002 and 
outlined above. With the retirement of Dr Julius from the board, no other 
non-executive directors are eligible for superannuation gratuities.
