Chairman's introduction
Dear shareholder
BP made many further positive steps in its recovery journey during 2012.  
The remuneration committee recognizes the patience of investors during 
this period since the 2010 Deepwater Horizon accident. Equally we 
recognize the persistence of our executives in embedding safe and 
effective operations deeply into the fabric of the company while 
systematically restoring value. Progress is being made, reflecting a clear 
strategy and disciplined execution.
Our remuneration system for executive directors is tied closely to this 
progress. The company's strategy forms the basis for an annual plan and 
the measures and targets used for both annual and long-term variable pay. 
Variable pay, based on performance, makes up the vast majority of total 
potential remuneration for executive directors, and of that, most is 
long-term, reflecting the nature of BP's business and providing strong 
alignment with shareholders.
Our process for determining pay is both rigorous and independent. I have 
met with a number of our key shareholders again this year to understand 
their perspectives. We seek to reflect shareholders' interests as well as 
to fairly reward the achievements of our executives, recognizing the 
contentious nature of top executive pay while ensuring competitiveness 
for our talented leadership. We believe informed, balanced judgement, 
and transparency of our decisions is vital. These principles continue to 
guide the committee's operation and have led to large variability in total 
remuneration for our executive directors over the past decade, reflecting 
the underlying performance of the company. 
2012 outcomes
The outcomes of the various plans that make up 2012 total remuneration 
for executive directors are summarized in the table on page 130. 
Annual bonus
Overall group performance was assessed at just below target. Annual 
bonus results were based on performance assessed against targets 
established at the start of the year and reflected the strategic priorities of 
safety and operational risk management, rebuilding trust and restoring 
value. 
Safety and risk management results, accounting for 30% of bonus, were 
generally at or better than plan, with significant improvement and high 
standards in both loss of primary containment and process safety tier 1 
incidents - both key indicators of process safety. 
Rebuilding trust accounted for 20% of bonus, and the company continued 
to make important gains as measured by independent surveys.
Restoring value metrics accounted for 50% of bonus with somewhat 
mixed results. Upstream major project delivery was on target, and 
divestment targets were exceeded but operating cash flow, underlying 
replacement cost profit and total cash costs did not achieve plan targets.
Performance shares
No shares vested in the 2010-2012 share element. Performance 
measures for this plan related to total shareholder return, production, net 
income, and downstream profitability - all relative to the other oil majors. 
As the starting point for these metrics was prior to the Deepwater Horizon 
accident, performance failed to meet the level required for vesting.
Other elements
Salaries were increased 3% mid-year for Bob Dudley, Iain Conn and 
Dr Byron Grote. The deferred bonus component was first introduced 
following shareholder approval in 2010, and so no plan is yet eligible for 
vesting and will not be until early 2014. Pension increases reflect the 
application of relevant plan rules. As Bob Dudley's defined benefit pension 
is based on three-year average remuneration, its increased value reflects a 
catching up with his promotion, first to the board in 2009 and secondly to 
group chief executive in 2010. Similarly, Dr Brian Gilvary's pension increase 
reflects his promotion to chief financial officer at the start of 2012.
2013 policy
For 2013 our overall policy for executive directors will remain largely 
unchanged, and is summarized on page 136. The continuity of our pay 
structure comprising salary, annual bonus, deferred bonus, performance 
shares, and pension, provides a relatively simple, performance-based 
system tied directly to strategy. Salaries will be reviewed mid-year taking 
into consideration both external and internal relativities. Annual bonus will 
operate in the same way as last year but the metrics have evolved slightly 
to reflect annual plan priorities and with increased weight on restoring 
value. Performance shares follow the same format as last year with minor 
change in the metrics to align with strategy. 
Report format
The UK government has issued draft regulations on revised reporting for 
directors' remuneration which are expected to be finalized later this year. 
We support many of the changes planned and have incorporated these 
into the current report to the extent we believe is appropriate while still 
complying with current regulations.
We hope that you find this report both informative and reassuring. Our 
commitment to both shareholder interests and executive engagement 
continues, and we are confident that our approach to executive pay aligns 
well with the recovery of BP's business.
The continuity of our pay structure provides a 
relatively simple, performance-based system 
tied directly to strategy.

Linked to strategy A substantial portion of executive remuneration should be linked to success in implementing the company's 
business strategy.
Performance related The major part of total remuneration should vary with performance, with the largest elements share based, 
further aligning interests with shareholders.
Long-term based The structure of pay should reflect the long-term nature of BP's business and the significance of safety and 
environmental risks. 
Informed judgement There should be both quantitative and qualitative assessments of performance with the committee making an 
informed judgement within a framework approved by shareholders.
Shareholder engagement The remuneration committee will actively seek to understand shareholder preferences and be transparent in 
explaining its remuneration policy and practices.
Fair treatment The total quantum of pay should take account of both external market and company conditions to achieve a 
balanced  fair' outcome.

As reflected in the diagram below, the company's strategy forms the core from which key performance indicators are established. The total 
remuneration for executive directors is then tied to this via the four elements of total remuneration identified in the diagram below. Three of the four 
vary with performance and the majority of their remuneration is long term. For ease of reference page numbers in the report have been identified for 
each element where further detail can be found. Corporate governance

2012 total remuneration in more depth
This section contains detail on executive directors' remuneration including salary, annual bonus and deferred bonus relating to 2012 and performance 
shares for 2010-2012.
The charts below summarize the actual total direct remuneration outcome of 2012 for each of the executive directors compared to the potential that would 
have been realised if variable plans had paid out at maximum.
The definitions for both the charts above and the summary table on the page opposite reflect those that are contained in the draft remuneration reporting 
regulations proposed by the UK government's Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS). In summary:
 Salary - actual salary received during 2012 both for actual and potential.
 Cash bonus - actual cash bonus received for 2012 compared to potential cash bonus if maximum of 225% of salary had been achieved and 
one-third mandatory deferral applied.
 Deferred bonus - as per the draft regulations, this reflects deferred bonus from previous years that vested in 2012. The first potential vesting will be 
in 2014.
 Performance shares - shows the actual value of the performance shares that vested at the end of 2012. The potential shows the value that would 
have been attained if all shares had vested. The same share price was used for both calculations. For Iain Conn, the information also reflects 
restricted shares awarded in 2008, and for Dr Brian Gilvary an award prior to him joining the board. Further detail can be found on page 133.

Salary - 2012 outcomes
Salaries were reviewed in May 2012 relative to other oil majors, other large 
UK and Europe-based international companies and key US companies. The 
committee also considered the level of pay increases for executives below 
board level, as well as different employee groups across the business. 
Based on this review, salaries were increased by 3% for Bob Dudley (to 
$1,751,000), Iain Conn (to  752,000) and Dr Byron Grote (to $1,485,000) 
effective 1 July 2012. Dr Brian Gilvary's salary of  690,000, which had been 
set on his appointment on 1 January, was unchanged. Corporate governance
BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012

Annual bonus - 2012 outcomes
Framework
All executive directors were eligible for an overall annual bonus, including 
deferral, of 150% of salary at target and a maximum of 225% of salary.  
Bob Dudley's annual bonus was based entirely on group results and Iain 
Conn's, Dr Brian Gilvary's, and Dr Byron Grote's were based 70% on group 
results and 30% on their respective segment or function.
Measures and targets for the annual bonus were set at the start of the year 
and were derived from the company's annual plan which, in turn, reflected 
its strategy and key performance indicators. Measures were grouped under 
the three dominant strategy themes of safety and operational risk 
management (S&OR), rebuilding trust, and restoring value. Targets were set 
so that meeting plan equates to on-target bonus.
At group level, S&OR was set to account for 30% of total bonus and 
included targets for loss of primary containment, process safety tier 1 
events, and recordable injury frequency. Rebuilding trust was weighted at 
20% of the total and included external reputation, and internal morale and 
engagement. Both components were assessed via results of surveys. 
Finally, restoring value was set to account for 50% of total bonus and 
included targets for operating cash flow, underlying replacement cost profit, 
total cash costs, gearing, divestments, upstream unplanned deferrals, 
upstream major project delivery, and Downstream net income per barrel.
Additional measures and targets were set for Iain Conn's, Dr Brian Gilvary's 
and Dr Byron Grote's respective segments or functions. These focused on 
safety, operating efficiency and profitability for the Downstream segment 
and key strategic priorities and outcomes for the functions.
As well as the specific measures set out, the committee considers any other 
results or factors it deems relevant and applies its judgement in determining 
final bonus outcomes.
Performance outcomes for the year are summarized in the table above,  
with a more detailed explanation following. 
Safety and operational risk management performance was strong. Loss  
of primary containment showed a 19% improvement and process safety 
tier 1 events dropped by 42% over last year. Both metrics are important 
indicators of process safety performance. Recordable injury frequency 
(RIF) included, for the first time, the biofuels business acquired last year. 
Demanding targets had been set to bring overall safety standards in the 
biofuels business to a level consistent with the rest of the company. In the 
end, performance in that business improved significantly but failed to 
meet the targets set and this meant that overall company targets were 
missed. Excluding biofuels, RIF performance was strong and improved 
over 2012.
Rebuilding trust showed overall satisfactory results. In terms of external 
reputation, independent external surveys showed important progress 
towards rebuilding reputation in both the US and UK. Internally, the  pulse 
survey' reflected good and improving overall engagement with 11 of 12 
areas of specific ongoing monitoring all showing like-for-like better results 
than last year.
Performance related to restoring value was somewhat mixed, in part 
reflecting the priority throughout the company's business of continuing to 
embed safe and effective operations. Operating cash flow, underlying 
replacement cost profit and total cash costs all came in between threshold 
and target. Divestment targets were far exceeded and gearing just below 
target. Upstream major project delivery was on target but unplanned deferrals 
missed threshold levels. Downstream net income per barrel also achieved 
between threshold and target.
Based on these results, the formulaic outcome for group results was 97%  
of target. The remuneration committee concluded that this represented 
fairly the overall performance of the business during the year, and 
confirmed the score for group purposes. Bob Dudley's total overall bonus 
therefore was 97% of target, resulting in 146% of salary. The same score 
was applied to each of the other executive directors for 70% of their 
bonus that was determined by group results. Combined with the results 
for their respective segments and functions the total overall scores were 
101% of target for Iain Conn, 106% for Dr Brian Gilvary and 97% for 
Dr Byron Grote.
Of the total bonuses referred to above, one-third is paid in cash, one-third  
is deferred on a mandatory basis, and one-third is paid either in cash or 
voluntarily deferred at the individual's discretion. As all four executive 
directors chose to participate in the voluntary deferral, amounts received 
by each of the individuals are shown below (as well as in the total 
remuneration summary chart on page 130).

Deferred bonus - 2012 outcomes
Framework
One-third of the total bonus awarded to the executive directors is deferred 
into shares on a mandatory basis under the terms of the deferred bonus 
element. Deferred shares are matched on a one-for-one basis and both 
deferred and matched shares vest after three years contingent on an 
assessment of safety and environmental sustainability over the three-year 
deferral period.
Individuals may elect to defer an additional one-third of total bonus into 
shares on the same basis and subject to the same contingency as the 
mandatory deferral.
Outcomes
No plans matured in 2012 for executive directors. The deferred element for 
executive directors was approved by shareholders and implemented in 2010. 
Therefore the first plan will be eligible to vest in early 2014 following the 
three-year deferral period and contingent on the assessment of safety and 
environmental sustainability over the same period.
Dr Brian Gilvary participated in a deferred bonus plan prior to his 
appointment as an executive director and details of this are provided in the 
table on page 144.
Performance shares - 2012 outcomes
Framework
Performance shares were awarded to each executive director in early 
2010 with vesting after three years dependent on performance relative  
to measures reflecting the company's strategic priorities at the time. For 
the 2010-2012 plan, vesting was based one-third on total shareholder 
return (TSR) compared to the other oil majors, and two-thirds on a 
balanced scorecard of underlying performance factors compared to the 
same peers. The underlying performance factors were production 
growth, Downstream profitability, and underlying net income growth. The 
peer group includes ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, Total and ConocoPhillips. 
Vesting was set at 100%, 70% and 35% for performance equivalent to 
first, second and third rank respectively and none for fourth or fifth place 
of the peer group, with BP's position interpolated amongst them.
Outcomes
As the starting point for all measures was before the Deepwater Horizon 
accident, the impact of this continues to be dominant. Results for all 
measures were below the third place required and so no shares vested. 
The resulting shares and value of the vesting for each individual are shown 
to the right (as well as in the total remuneration summary chart on 
page 130).

continued service and satisfactory performance. The first tranche of these 
vested in February 2011 and the second in February 2013. This final 
tranche has been included in this year's disclosure for completeness. 
Dr Brian Gilvary's vesting reflects awards granted prior to him joining the 
board under equivalent plans below board level which vest at the same 
time as the executive director performance shares.
Pensions - 2012 outcomes
Framework
Executive directors are eligible to participate in regular company pension 
schemes that apply in their home countries which follow national norms in 
terms of structure and levels. 
Bob Dudley and Dr Byron Grote both participate in the US plan and Iain Conn 
and Dr Brian Gilvary in the UK plan. Full details on these plans are set out in 
the policy section of this report (page 141).
Outcomes
The table below sets out the change in pension for 2012. This table follows 
the format required by current UK reporting regulations rather than the draft 
regulations that are expected to come into effect in late 2013. 
Bob Dudley's pension increase is largely due to his promotion to group chief 
executive in late 2010. Since his pension is based on three-year average 
salary and bonus, the impact of a promotion takes a number of years to be 
fully reflected in his pension. Dr Brian Gilvary's pension, based on final 
salary, also shows a significant increase due to his promotion in January 
2012. 
Under the draft regulations, the disclosure of total pension includes any cash 
in lieu of additional accrual that is paid to individuals in the UK scheme who 
have exceeded the annual allowance or lifetime allowance under UK 
regulations. Both Iain Conn and Dr Brian Gilvary fall into this category and in 
2012 received cash supplements of 35% of salary in lieu of future service 
accrual. 
In terms of calculating the increase in pension value both a column on 20 
times additional pension earned during the year as per the draft regulations, 
as well as the transfer value increase as currently stipulated have been 
included in the table below. The summary table on page 130 uses the 
increase in transfer value (last column below) to which the cash 
supplements are separately identified.

Remuneration committee
The committee was made up of the following independent  
non-executive directors: 
Antony Burgmans - chairman
George David 
Ian Davis
Professor Dame Anne Dowling (appointed July 2012)
Carl-Henric Svanberg normally attends the meetings. 
Tasks
The committee's tasks are formally set out in the board governance 
principles as follows:
 To determine, on behalf of the board, the terms of engagement  
and remuneration of the group chief executive and the executive 
directors and to report on these to the shareholders.
 To determine, on behalf of the board, matters of policy over which  
the company has authority regarding the establishment or operation  
of the company's pension schemes of which the executive directors 
are members.
 To nominate, on behalf of the board, any trustees (or directors  
of corporate trustees) of such schemes.
 To review and approve the policies and actions being applied by  
the group chief executive in remunerating senior executives other  
than executive directors to ensure alignment and proportionality.
 To recommend to the board the quantum and structure of remuneration 
for the chairman of the board.
Committee activities
During the year, the committee met five times. Key discussions  
and decision items are shown in the table below. 
The committee again undertook an evaluation of its operations using an 
external questionnaire administered by an external consultant. The 
committee discussed the findings at its January 2013 meeting. Almost all 
processes were rated as good to excellent in the report and in discussion 
the committee identified a number of areas for inclusion in 2013 agendas.

Independence
The committee operates with a high level of independence. The board 
considers all committee members to be independent (see page 112)  
with no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the 
committee's decisions. 
The group chief executive is consulted on matters relating to the other 
executive directors and senior executives who report to him and on 
matters relating to the performance of the company; neither he nor the 
chairman of the board participate in decisions on their own remuneration. 
Both the company's head of human resources and head of group reward 
attend relevant sections of meetings to ensure appropriate input on 
matters related to executives below board level.
Gerrit Aronson, an independent consultant, is the committee's 
independent adviser as well as secretary. He is engaged directly by the 
committee and not by executive management. Advice is also received 
from the company secretary, who reports to the chairman of the board; 
and from other external advisers appointed by the committee for 
specialist advice and services on particular remuneration matters. In  
2012 the committee continued to engage Towers Watson as its principal 
external adviser, primarily for market information. Freshfields Bruckhaus 
Deringer LLP provided legal advice on specific matters to the committee. 
Both firms provide other advice in their respective areas to the group. The 
independence of the advice is periodically reviewed by David Jackson,  
the company secretary to ensure it meets a high standard.
Shareholder engagement
The committee values its dialogue with major shareholders on 
remuneration matters. During the year the committee's chairman and the 
committee's independent adviser personally met with key shareholders 
holding around 20% of the company's shares to ascertain their views and 
discuss important aspects of the committee's policy. They also met key 
proxy advisers to similarly engage. This engagement provides the 
committee with an important direct perspective of shareholder interests 
and, along with the vote at the AGM on the directors' remuneration 
report, is considered when making decisions. Corporate governance

2013 remuneration policy
Overview
Remuneration policy summary
Component Policy and opportunity 2013 operation and performance metrics
Salary Base salaries should be competitive relative to relevant  
market peer groups and are normally reviewed annually.
Salaries as at 1 January 2013 are: Bob Dudley $1,751,000,  
Iain Conn  752,000, Dr Brian Gilvary  690,000 and Dr Byron 
Grote $1,485,000.
Annual bonus Annual bonus should be based on performance relative  
to measures and targets reflecting the annual plan, which  
in turn reflects the strategic priorities of the company.
Achieving plan results should equate to on-target bonus.  
On-target bonus is set at 150% of salary for executive 
directors with a maximum of 225% of salary.
Bonus measures for 2013 are:
 operational risk management (30%).
- Loss of primary containment. 
- Process safety tier 1 events.
- Recordable injury frequency. 

- Operating cash flow. 
- Underlying replacement cost profit. 
- Total cash costs.
- Upstream unplanned deferrals.
- Upstream major project delivery.
- Downstream net income per barrel.
No change from last year on safety and operational risk 
management. Weight on value creation increased from 50% 
last year by eliminating rebuilding trust as a measure.
Deferred bonus A portion of annual bonus should be paid in shares and 
deferred to add long-term sustainability and shareholder 
alignment to short-term performance achievement.
One-third of annual bonus is deferred on a mandatory basis 
and a further one-third can be deferred on a voluntary basis.
All deferred shares are matched on a one-for-one basis.
All deferred and matched shares vest after three years 
contingent on an assessment of safety and environmental 
sustainability over the three-year deferral period.
No change from last year.
Performance shares A large portion of total remuneration for executive directors 
should be tied to the long-term performance of the company.
Shares to a value of 5.5 times salary for the group chief 
executive and 4 times salary for the other executive directors 
are normally awarded annually.
Vesting of the shares after three years is dependent on 
performance relative to measures reflecting the strategic 
priorities of the company.
Those shares that vest are held for an additional three-year 
retention period, after payment of tax on vesting.
The 2013-2015 share element will vest based equally on the 
following three performance metrics:



- Reserves replacement versus oil majors. 
- Process safety. 
- Major project delivery.
Executive directors are expected to develop a personal 
shareholding of five times salary before shares are released.
No change from last year with the exception of major project 
delivery replacing rebuilding trust as one of the strategic 
imperatives, to align with strategy.
Pension and other 
benefits
Executive directors should participate in the normal company 
pension and benefit schemes applying in their home 
countries.
Both UK and US executive directors remain on defined benefit 
pension plans. UK directors, as for all UK employees who 
exceed the annual allowance set by legislation, may receive a 
cash supplement in lieu of future service pension accrual.
See pages 28-29 for how our bonus measures for 2012 
and 2013 are directly linked to business KPIs. Corporate governance

2013 remuneration policy in more depth
Total remuneration is made up of the five components summarized in the table opposite. Each of these is explained in more detail in this section of the 
report. The total remuneration opportunity for executive directors is strongly performance based and weighted to the long term. As shown below over 
90% of the group chief executive's total direct remuneration opportunity (that is at maximum) requires the achievement of demanding performance 
requirements, and over 80% is long term - three years in the case of deferred bonus and six years for the performance shares.
The two charts above provide scenarios for what executive directors may 
get paid for different levels of performance, consistent with the draft UK 
regulations on remuneration reporting. Dr Byron Grote's chart shows 
full-year values for illustration and does not reflect the impact of his 
announced retirement from the board.
The minimum amount reflects current base salary which is the only part 
of total direct remuneration that is not performance related. 
On-target amounts are based on the following assumptions:
 Current salary.
 Cash bonus reflecting  on-target' level of 150% of salary of which 
two-thirds is paid in cash.
 Deferred bonus reflecting one-third of  on-target' bonus of 150% which 
is deferred on a mandatory basis and matched on a one-for-one basis.
 Performance shares that vest to a value of one half of the maximum.
 Share prices are assumed to remain constant for calculation purposes.
Maximum amounts are based on the following assumptions:
 Current salary.
 Cash bonus reflecting maximum level of 225% of salary of which 
one-third is paid in cash.
 Deferred bonus reflecting two-thirds of maximum bonus of 225% 
which is deferred on a mandatory and voluntary basis, and matched 
one-for-one.
 Performance shares that fully vest amounting to 5.5 times salary for the 
group chief executive and 4 times salary for other executive directors.
 Share prices are assumed to remain constant for calculation purposes. 
 
 
Salary - 2013 policy
As most components of total remuneration are determined as multiples of 
salary, the remuneration committee makes careful reviews of salaries, 
normally annually. These reviews include thorough consideration of other 
large UK and Europe-based global companies, other oil majors, and 
relevant US companies. They also include similar consideration of the 
salary treatment throughout the company, as well as company 
performance and investor perspectives. It is expected that salaries for 
executive directors will be reviewed mid-year in this context. Corporate governance
BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012
138
Operation
For 2013, all executive directors will again be eligible for a total bonus 
(including deferral) of 150% of salary at target and 225% at maximum.  
Bob Dudley's bonus will be based entirely on group measures as will 
Dr Brian Gilvary's and Dr Byron Grote's. Iain Conn will have 70% of his 
bonus based on group results and 30% on his business segment.
The group strategy provides the overall context for the company's key 
performance indicators and the focus for the annual plan. From this, 
measures and targets are selected at the start of the year for senior 
managers, including executive directors, to reflect the key priorities of the 
business. Measures typically include a range of financial and operating 
metrics as well as those relating to safety and environment.
The committee has a preference for quantifiable, hard targets that can be 
factually measured and objectively assessed according to well understood 
principles and definitions. Where it is more appropriate to have more 
qualitative measures, the information that will be reviewed to arrive at 
conclusions is established at the start of the year. Targets are set so that 
achieving plan levels of performance results in on-target bonus.
At the end of each year, performance is assessed relative to the measures and 
targets established at the start of the year, adjusted for any material changes in 
the market environment (predominantly oil prices).
As in past years, in addition to the specific bonus metrics, the committee 
will also review the underlying performance of the group in light of the 
overall business plan, competitors' results, analysts' reports, and seek 
input from other committees on relevant aspects. When appropriate, the 
committee may make adjustments to a straight formulaic result based on 
this fuller information. The committee considers that this informed 
judgement is important to establishing a fair overall assessment.
The rigorous process followed by the committee has resulted in  
bonus levels varying considerably over the past several years, reflecting 
the changing fortunes of the company during the period. 
The chart below shows the average annual bonus result (before any 
deferral) and relative to an on-target level for executive directors  
for 2012 as well as the previous five years. 
 
Performance measures
The measures used to determine bonus results flow directly from the 
group's annual plan which reflects the strategic priorities of safety and 
operational risk management, and reinforcing value creation. 
A central strategic priority continues to be safety and managing risk.  
As last year, performance in this area will account for 30% of group 
results for bonus purposes. The primary measures used to assess 
performance will be loss of primary containment, process safety tier 1 
events, and recordable injury frequency. The first two of these track 
process safety while the third reflects personal safety and this balance 
gives an overall perspective on performance. The committee will also 
seek the input of the safety, ethics and environment assurance committee 
(SEEAC) to determine if there are any other factors or metrics that should 
be considered in arriving at a final assessment at year end.
A second set of measures will track performance relative to value creation 
and account for 70% of group results for bonus purposes. This reflects 
increased emphasis on restoring value from last year when it accounted 
for 50%. The  rebuilding trust' set of measures, accounting for 20% last 
year, will not feature in 2013. Three financial measures for value creation 
include operating cash flow, underlying replacement cost profit, and total 
cash cost. Three additional operating metrics include upstream major 
project delivery, upstream planned deferrals, and Downstream net income 
per barrel. This set of metrics provides a balance of financial and operating 
priorities, as well as significant continuity from last year.
The Downstream segment will include specific safety metrics for the 
segment. Value metrics will include availability, efficiency, and profitability 
measures, as well as divestments and major project delivery.

Operation
For 2013, as last year, one-third of the annual bonus will be deferred  
on a mandatory basis into shares for three years. Under the rules of the 
plan, the average share price over the three days following announcement 
of full-year results is used to determine the number of shares. Deferred 
shares are matched by the company on a one-for-one basis.
Executive directors may defer a further one-third of their annual bonus  
into shares on a voluntary basis, which will be capable of vesting, and  
will qualify for matching, on the same basis as set out above. 
Both deferred and matched shares will vest in early 2017 contingent on an 
assessment of safety and environmental sustainability over the three-year 
deferral period. Where shares vest, the executive director will also receive 
additional shares representing the value of the re-invested dividends.
Deferred bonus - 2013 policy
The structure of deferred bonus, paid in shares, places increased focus on long-term alignment with shareholders, and reinforces the critical importance 
of maintaining high safety and environmental standards. It effectively translates the outcome of a portion of the annual bonus into a long-term plan with 
additional performance hurdles. As shown below, the performance results of 2013 will form the basis for determining the deferred bonus in 2014.
Performance measures
Since 2010, the deferred bonus has been subject to a safety and 
environmental sustainability hurdle, and this will again be applied  
this coming year. 
If the committee assesses that there has been a material deterioration  
in safety and environmental metrics, or there have been major incidents 
revealing underlying weaknesses in safety and environmental 
management, then it may conclude that shares should vest in part, or not 
at all. In reaching its conclusion, the committee will obtain advice from  
the SEEAC. 
The committee believes that this safety and environmental hurdle is 
appropriate for several reasons. First, high standards in this area are  
an important priority of BP's strategy. Second, maintaining safety  
and environmental standards over the long-term is a good qualitative 
determinant of the sustainability of the business. Third, this non-financial 
hurdle will complement the financial and operational performance 
conditions applicable to performance share awards.

Performance shares - 2013 policy
The performance share element reflects the committee's policy that a large proportion of total remuneration is tied to long-term performance.  
A three-year performance period, combined with a further three-year retention period for those shares that vest, creates a six-year incentive structure 
which is designed to ensure executive interests are aligned with those of shareholders.
For the relative measures, TSR and the reserves replacement ratio,  
the comparator group will consist of ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and Chevron. 
This group can be altered if circumstances change, for example, if there is 
significant consolidation in the industry. While a narrow group, it continues 
to represent the comparators that both shareholders and management 
use in assessing relative performance. 
The TSR will be calculated as the share price performance over the 
three-year period, assuming dividends are reinvested. All share prices  
will be averaged over the three-month period before the beginning and 
end of the performance period. They will be measured in US dollars.
The reserves replacement ratio is defined according to industry standard 
specifications and its calculation is audited. As in previous years, the 
methodology used for the relative measures will rank each of the five 
oil majors on each measure. Performance shares for each component 
will vest at levels of 100%, 70% and 35% respectively, for performance 
equivalent to first, second and third rank. No shares will vest for fourth  
or fifth place.
Operating cash flow has been identified as a core strategic priority of  
the company. Targets have been established reflecting agreed plans, 
$100/bbl oil price and other normal operating assumptions.
Finally the remaining strategic imperatives relating to process safety and 
major project delivery will be determined by a mixture of internal targets 
and external assessment. In the case of safety, loss of primary 
containments, process safety tier 1 incidents and recordable injury 
frequency will provide the key factual data as well as the input of the 
SEEAC. Major project delivery component will be based on the 
commissioning success of major projects.
The committee considers that this combination of quantitative  
and qualitative measures reflects the long-term value creation priorities of 
the company as well as the key underpinnings for business sustainability. 
As in previous years, the committee may exercise its discretion, in a 
reasonable and informed manner, to adjust vesting levels upwards or 
downwards if it concludes that the formulaic approach does not reflect 
the true underlying health and performance of BP's business relative to its 
peers. It will explain any adjustments in the directors' remuneration report 
following vesting, in line with its commitment to transparency.
Operation
Performance shares are awarded conditionally at the start of each year. 
For 2013, as last year, shares have been awarded to a value of 5.5 times 
salary for the group chief executive and 4 times salary for the other 
executive directors (the maximum allowed under the plan). 
Performance shares will only vest to the extent that performance 
conditions, as described below, are met. The committee also has an 
overriding discretion, in exceptional circumstances, to reduce the number 
of shares that vest.
Where shares vest, the executive director will receive additional shares 
representing the value of the re-invested dividends on those shares. 
Sufficient shares may be sold at vesting to discharge tax liabilities. 
The remaining vested shares will normally be subject to a compulsory 
retention period of a further three years. Furthermore, these shares will 
only be released once the company's minimum shareholding target of five 
times salary has been met.
The history of vesting of the share element for the past plan and the 
five previous ones is shown below, reflecting both demanding 
performance conditions and poor company performance during this 
period.

Performance conditions for the 2013-2015 share element will be aligned 
with the company's strategic agenda which continues to focus on value 
creation and reinforcing safety and operational risk management. Vesting 
of shares will be based one-third on BP's total shareholder return (TSR) 
compared to other oil majors, reflecting the central importance of 
restoring the value of the company. A further third will be based on the 
operating cash flow of the company, reflecting a central element of value 
creation. The final third will be based on a set of strategic imperatives; in 
particular, reserves replacement, safety and operational risk, and major 
project delivery.

As of 31 December 2012, Dr Byron Grote will also receive a benefit from 
the BP Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefit Plan (SERB). The 
benefit payable under this supplemental plan is based on a target of 1.3% 
of final average earnings (including for this purpose base salary plus cash 
bonus and bonus deferred into a compulsory or voluntary award under the 
deferred matching element of the EDIP) for each year of service (without 
regard for tax limits) less benefits paid under all other BP (US) qualified 
and non-qualified pension arrangements. The benefit payable under SERB 
is unreduced at age 60 but reduced by 5% per year if separation occurs 
before age 60. Benefits payable under this plan are unfunded and 
therefore paid from corporate assets. As of 31 December 2012, Bob 
Dudley will not receive a benefit from this plan due to the value of his 
benefits under the other plans.
UK executive directors
Iain Conn and Dr Brian Gilvary are members of the regular BP pension 
scheme in respect of service prior to 1 April 2011. The core benefits 
under this scheme are non-contributory. They include a pension accrual 
of 1/60th of basic salary for each year of service, up to a maximum of 
two-thirds of final basic salary and a dependant's benefit of two-thirds of 
the member's pension. The scheme pension is not integrated with state 
pension benefits. Higher accrual rules are offered to employees on the 
payment of personal contributions.
Since 1 April 2011 the UK directors, Iain Conn and Dr Brian Gilvary, have 
received a cash supplement in lieu of future service pension accrual in 
the BP pension scheme. This follows the reduction in the annual 
allowance applicable to plans such as the BP pension scheme in 2011. 
Some employees, including the UK directors, have had to cease pension 
accrual for future service to remain within the new annual allowance. For 
all these employees the cash supplement is equal to 35% of basic salary.
Until the end of March 2011, pension benefits in excess of the individual 
lifetime allowance set by legislation were paid via an unapproved, 
unfunded pension arrangement provided directly by the company. From 
April 2011 only increases in accrued benefits due to increases in salary in 
excess of the individual lifetime allowance are covered by their 
arrangements. Both Iain Conn and Dr Brian Gilvary are covered under this 
arrangement. 
The rules of the BP pension scheme were amended in 2006 such that 
the normal retirement age is 65. Prior to 1 December 2006, scheme 
members could retire on or after age 60 without reduction.
Both Iain Conn and Dr Brian Gilvary were in service at 1 December 2006, 
and therefore special early retirement terms apply to them. In the event 
of retirement between 60 and 65, they are entitled to an immediate 
unreduced pension. In the event of retirement between 55 and 60, they 
are entitled to an immediate unreduced pension in respect of the 
proportion of their benefit for service up to 30 November 2006, and are 
subject to such reduction as the scheme actuary certifies in respect of 
the period of service after 1 December 2006. For retirees leaving in 
circumstances approved by the committee the scheme actuary has to 
date applied a reduction of 3% per annum in respect of the period of 
service from 1 December 2006 up to the leaving date; a greater reduction 
can be applied in other circumstances. Those leaving before 55 are 
entitled to a deferred pension that becomes payable from 55 or later, on 
the basis set out above. Irrespective of the above, an individual leaving in 
circumstances of total incapacity is entitled to an immediate unreduced 
pension as from the leaving date.
Executive directors are eligible to participate in the appropriate pension 
schemes that apply in their home country and that follow national norms 
in terms of structure and levels. Details of pension accrual are set out in 
the table on page 133 and take into account the total amount that could be 
payable under relevant plans as described further below.
US executive directors
Pension benefits are provided to Bob Dudley and Dr Byron Grote through 
a combination of tax-qualified and non-qualified benefit plans, consistent 
with US tax regulations, as applicable.
The BP Retirement Accumulation Plan (US pension plan) is a US tax-
qualified plan that features a cash balance formula and includes 
grandfathering provisions under final average pay formulas for certain 
members of acquired companies, including Bob Dudley, who participated 
in the predecessor Amoco pension plan, which was merged into the BP 
US pension plan effective 1 July 2000. 
Bob Dudley was an active member of the Employee Retirement Plan of 
Amoco Corporation on 30 June 2000 and is classified as an Amoco 
heritage participant under the US pension plan. As with all Amoco 
heritage participants, he is entitled to receive the greater of (a) the cash 
balance benefit under the US pension plan; and (b) the sum of (i) his 
accrued benefit as of 31 December 2012 under the Amoco heritage plan 
formula (described below) and (ii) a new cash balance account 
(established 1 January 2013 with a zero balance). Bob Dudley's benefit 
under the Amoco heritage plan is based on his average annual eligible 
earnings (being base salary plus cash bonus, subject to the IRS 
compensation limit) over the better of (i) the last consecutive 36 months 
of benefit service preceding his termination date, and (ii) the highest three 
consecutive calendar years out of his last 10 years of benefit service. Bob 
Dudley's retirement benefit under the US pension plan is unreduced at 
age 60 but reduced by 5% per year if taken before age 60.
Dr Byron Grote was an active member of the BP America Retirement 
Accumulation Plan on 30 June 2000 and is classified as a BP heritage 
participant. As a BP heritage participant, he is entitled to receive the cash 
balance benefit under the US pension plan with additional payment 
options.
BP also provides a number of non-qualified pension plans in which Bob 
Dudley and Dr Byron Grote participate.
Bob Dudley will receive a benefit under the TNK-BP Supplemental 
Retirement Plan which is a lump sum benefit based on the same 
calculation as his benefit under the US pension plan but reflecting his 
service and earnings at TNK-BP. 
The BP Excess Compensation (Retirement) Plan (excess compensation 
plan) provides a supplemental benefit which is the difference between (a) 
the benefit accrual under the US pension plan and the TNK-BP 
Supplement Retirement Plan without regard to the IRS compensation 
limit (including for this purpose base salary, cash bonus and bonus 
deferred into a compulsory or voluntary award under the deferred 
matching element of the EDIP), and (b) the actual benefit payable under 
the US pension plan and the TNK-BP Supplemental Retirement Plan, 
applying the IRS compensation limit. The benefit calculation under the 
heritage Amoco formula includes a reduction of 5% per year if taken 
before age 60.
Dr Byron Grote will receive a benefit under the BP America Inc. 
Supplemental Retirement Accumulation Plan (SRAP), which is a lump 
sum cash balance that only grows with interest based on the greater of 
the 30-year US Treasury bond interest rate or 5%.
Other benefits - 2013 policy
Executive directors are eligible to participate in regular employee benefit plans and in all-employee share saving schemes applying in their home 
countries. Benefits in kind are not pensionable. Corporate governance

Service contracts
Summary details of each executive director's service agreement are  
as follows:
Table of contracts
Service agreement date
Salary as at  
1 Jan 2013
Bob Dudley 6 Apr 2009 $1,751,000
Iain Conn  22 Jul 2004  752,000
Dr Brian Gilvary 22 Feb 2012  690,000
Dr Byron Grote 7 Aug 2000 $1,485,000
Bob Dudley's contract is with BP Corporation North America Inc. He  
is seconded to BP p.l.c. under a secondment agreement dated 15 April 
2012, which expires on 15 April 2014. Dr Byron Grote's agreement is with 
BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. He is seconded to BP p.l.c. under a 
secondment agreement of 7 August 2000, which expires at the date of 
the 2013 AGM. Both secondments can be terminated by one month's 
notice by either party and terminate automatically on the termination of 
their service agreements. Iain Conn's and Dr Brian Gilvary's service 
agreements are with BP p.l.c.
Each executive director is entitled to pension provision, details of which 
are summarized on page 133 of this report.
Each executive director is entitled to the following contractual benefits:
 A company car for business and private use, on terms that the company 
bear all normal servicing, insurance and running costs. Alternatively, the 
executive director is entitled to a car allowance in lieu.
 Medical and dental benefits; sick pay during periods of absence; tax 
preparation assistance.
 Indemnification in accordance with applicable law.
Each executive director participates in bonus or incentive arrangements at 
the committee's sole discretion. Currently, each participates in the 
discretionary bonus scheme and the EDIP, described on pages 138 and 
139 and 140 of this report respectively.
Each executive director may terminate his employment by giving his 
employer 12 months' written notice. In this event, for business reasons, 
the employer would not necessarily hold the executive director to his full 
notice period. 
Other than in the case of Dr Brian Gilvary (who became a director on 
1 January 2012), the service agreements are expressed to expire at a 
normal retirement age of 60; however, such executive directors could not, 
under UK law, be required to retire at this (or any other) age following 
abolition of the default retirement age.
The employer may lawfully terminate the executive director's employment 
in the following ways:
 By giving the director 12 months' written notice.
 Without compensation, in circumstances where the employer is 
entitled to terminate for cause, as defined for the purposes of his 
service agreement.
Additionally, in the case of Iain Conn and Dr Brian Gilvary, the company 
may lawfully terminate employment by making a lump sum payment in 
lieu of notice equal to 12 months' base salary. The company may elect to 
pay this sum in monthly instalments rather than as a lump sum.
The lawful termination mechanisms described above are without 
prejudice to the employer's ability in appropriate circumstances to 
terminate in breach of the notice period referred to above, and thereby to 
be liable for damages to the executive director. 
In the event of termination by the company, each executive director may 
have an entitlement to compensation in respect of his statutory rights 
under employment protection legislation in the UK and potentially 
elsewhere. 
The committee considers that its policy on termination payments arising 
from the contractual provisions summarised above provides an 
appropriate degree of protection to the director in the event of termination, 
and is consistent with UK market practice.
Exit payment policy
If it became necessary for the company to terminate an executive 
director's employment, and therefore to determine a termination payment, 
the committee's policy would be as follows in relation to the matters 
described below:
 The director's primary entitlement would be to a termination payment in 
respect of his service agreement, as set out above. The committee will 
consider mitigation to reduce the termination payment to a leaving 
director when appropriate to do so, having regard to the circumstances 
and the law governing the agreement. Mitigation would not be 
applicable where a contractual payment in lieu of notice is made. In 
addition, the director may be entitled to a payment in respect of his 
statutory rights. Other potential elements are as follows. First, the 
committee would consider whether the director should be entitled to an 
annual bonus in respect of the financial year in which the termination 
occurs; normally, any such bonus would be restricted to the director's 
actual period of service in that financial year. Second, the committee 
would consider whether conditional share awards held by the director 
under the EDIP should lapse on leaving or should, at the committee's 
discretion, be preserved (in which event the award would normally 
continue until the normal vesting date and be treated in the manner 
described on pages 139 and 140 of this report). Any such determination 
will be made in accordance with the rules of the EDIP, as approved by 
shareholders. Third, if the departing director is eligible for an early 
retirement pension, the committee would consider, if relevant under 
the terms of the plan in which the director participates, the extent of 
any actuarial reduction that should be applied.
 In determining the overall termination arrangements, the committee 
would have regard to all relevant circumstances, and would therefore 
distinguish between types of leaver and the circumstances under 
which the director left the company. This is primarily relevant to 
consideration of how discretion would be exercised in relation to 
conditional share awards under the EDIP. It is also relevant where a 
departing director has a right to an early retirement pension. UK 
directors who leave in circumstances approved by the committee may 
have a favourable actuarial reduction applied to their pensions (which 
has to date been 3%). Departing directors who leave in other 
circumstances are subject to a greater reduction.
 The performance of the leaving director would be taken into account in 
various respects. In particular, in deciding whether to exercise 
discretion to preserve EDIP awards, the committee would have regard 
to the director's performance during the performance cycle of the 
relevant awards, as well as a range of other relevant factors, including 
the proximity of the award to its maturity date.
 The committee would also have regard to all other relevant factors, 
including consideration of whether a contractual provision in the 
director's arrangements complied with best practice at the time the 
director's employment was terminated as well as at the time the 
provision was agreed to.
Director leaving the board
Dr Byron Grote will be retiring from the board at the 2013 AGM, and 
ceasing employment with the company soon after. Under the rules of the 
EDIP, his outstanding performance share awards pertaining to the 
2011-2013, 2012-2014 and 2013-2015 performance periods, as well as the 
matching share awards in respect of 2010, 2011 and 2012 deferred bonus 
will all be prorated to reflect actual service during the applicable three-year 
performance periods. These share awards will vest at the normal time to 
the extent the performance targets or hurdles are met. His 2013 bonus 
eligibility will likewise be prorated to reflect his service and based on 
group results for the year. He will not receive any termination payments 
on leaving service. Corporate governance

  BP's performance is measured against the oil sector. For awards under the 2010-2012 plan, performance conditions were measured one-third on TSR against ExxonMobil, Shell, Total, ConocoPhillips 
and Chevron and two-thirds on a balanced scorecard of underlying performance. For awards under the 2011-2013 plan, performance conditions are measured 50% on TSR against ExxonMobil, Shell, 
Total, ConocoPhillips and Chevron; 20% on reserves replacement against the same peer group; and 30% against a balanced scorecard of strategic imperatives. For awards under the 2012-2014 plan, 
performance conditions are measured one-third on TSR against ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and Chevron; one-third on safety and operational risk management; and one-third on a balanced scorecard of 
strategic imperatives. Each performance period ends on 31 December of the third year.

Policy
The board sets the level of remuneration for all non-executive directors 
within a limit approved from time to time by shareholders. Key elements 
of BP's policy on non-executive director remuneration include:
 Remuneration should be sufficient to attract, motivate and retain 
world-class non-executive talent.
 Remuneration of non-executive directors should be proportional to their 
contribution towards the interests of the company.
 Remuneration practice should be consistent with recognized best 
practice standards for non-executive directors' remuneration.
 As a UK-listed company, the quantum and structure of non-executive 
director remuneration will primarily be compared against best UK 
practice.
 Remuneration should be in the form of cash fees, payable monthly.
 Non-executive directors should not receive share options from the 
company.
 Non-executive directors are encouraged to establish a holding in BP 
shares of the equivalent value of one year's base fee.
 Remuneration for non-executive directors is reviewed annually.
Process
BP reviews the quantum and structure of chairman and non-executive 
remuneration on an annual basis. The chairman's remuneration is 
reviewed by the remuneration committee, which makes a 
recommendation to the board; the chairman does not vote on his own 
remuneration. Non-executive director remuneration is reviewed by the 
chairman, who makes a recommendation to the board; non-executive 
directors do not vote on their own remuneration.
The review of non-executive remuneration undertaken in 2012 
benchmarked the structure and fees of BP non-executive directors against 
the ten largest companies by market capitalization in the FTSE100. The 
review concluded that fee levels, which had not been increased since 
2007, had fallen below the comparator group and changes were made to 
the following fee elements:
 Increase in the basic board member fee from  75,000 to  90,000.
 Increase in committee membership fees from  5,000 to  20,000.
 Increase in the remuneration committee chairmanship fee from 
 20,000 to  30,000.
All other fees remained unchanged.
The review also concluded that the company should be willing to 
reimburse professional fees up to  5,000 per annum incurred by 
non-executive directors based outside the UK in connection with advice 
and assistance on UK tax compliance matters.
