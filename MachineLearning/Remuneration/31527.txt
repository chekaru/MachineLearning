Remuneration Committee
The Group has established a Remuneration Committee, comprising the three non-executive directors, Ken Ford, Simon 
Godfrey and Mark Muth.
The Committee's main role and responsibilities are as follows:
To review, and determine on behalf of the Board, the specific remuneration and incentive packages for each of the   
Company's executive directors;
To review, and approve on behalf of the Board, the remuneration and benefits of senior management;   
To review, and make recommendations to the Board in respect of, the design of remuneration structures and levels of   
pay and other incentives for employees of the Group, including share option awards and any adjustments to the terms 
of share ownership and share option schemes;
To be responsible for reporting to the Group's shareholders in relation to remuneration policies applicable to the   
Group's executive directors.
The Committee may invite the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Finance Officer to attend meetings of the Remuneration 
Committee. The Chief Executive Officer is consulted on proposals relating to the remuneration of the Chief Finance 
Officer and of other senior executives of the Group. The Chief Executive Officer is not involved in setting his own 
remuneration.
The Committee may use remuneration consultants to advise it in setting remuneration structures and policies. The 
Committee is exclusively responsible for appointing such consultants and for setting their terms of reference.
The Committee's terms of reference are reviewed and approved by the Board. These are available for inspection at the 
Company's registered office.
Remuneration policy
The Group's policy on remuneration is to provide a package of benefits, including salary, performance-related bonuses 
and share options, which reward success and individual contributions to the Group's overall performance appropriately, 
while avoiding paying more than is necessary for this purpose. The Group's Articles of Association do not permit directors' 
remuneration to exceed  750,000 per annum in aggregate. In addition, the Remuneration Committee takes into account 
remuneration packages of comparable companies when making recommendations to the Board. 
Performance-related elements of remuneration are designed to align the interests of executive directors with those of 
shareholders and accordingly are set as a significant proportion of total remuneration.
Stock options
The Group considers that active participation in a share option plan is an effective means of incentivising and retaining 
high quality people. Directors and employees are eligible to participate in the scheme. Further details of the option plan 
and outstanding options as at 31 December 2008 are given in note 11 to the financial statements.
Service agreements
The executive directors entered into service agreements with BrainJuicer Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the 
Company on 22 January 2003. The agreements include restrictive covenants which apply during employment and for a 
period of twelve months after termination. 
John's agreement can be terminated on six month's notice in writing by either the Company or by John. James' agreement 
can be terminated on twelve months notice in writing by the Company and six months' notice by James.
Non-executive directors
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the executive directors.
Ken, Mark and Simon's appointments can be terminated on six months' notice in writing by either the Company or by the 
non-executive director. However, the Company has entered into an agreement not to exercise its right to terminate Mark's 
appointment while for so long as Unilever UK Holdings Limited remains the registered holder of not less than 10 per cent 
of the issued share capital of the Company.
