 23  BRAMMER REMUNERATION REPORT
The remuneration committee (the committee ) members are Chris Conway, David Dunn and Kevin Mellor,
who are all independent non-executive directors. Kevin Mellor is the chairman of the committee. Members of the
committee have no personal financial interest in the company other than as shareholders and the fees paid to them
as non-executive directors. They are not involved in the day-to-day running of the company.
Ian Fraser, as chief executive, although not a member of the committee, on occasions and for matters not related
to himself, may be invited to attend meetings. He is consulted by the committee on proposals relating to the
remuneration of the other executive directors and appropriate senior executives.
Role of the committee
The committee, on behalf of the board, determines and approves remuneration policy for the group and all elements
of the remuneration arrangements for executive directors.
On the board's behalf, the committee approves the general recruitment terms, remuneration benefits, employment
conditions and severance terms for senior executives and determines the specific recruitment terms, remuneration
benefits, employment conditions, pension rights, compensation payments and severance terms for the executive
directors. It also approves the rules and associated guidelines for the granting of executive share options, savings
related share options and the performance share plan.
The remuneration committee has its own terms of reference which are periodically reviewed by the committee and
the board. These will be reviewed during the year, to ensure compliance with the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance and once approved by the remuneration committee and the board will be displayed on the company's
web site.
The chairman of the company and the chairman of the remuneration committee are available to shareholders to
discuss remuneration policy.
In its deliberations, the committee gives full consideration to the principles of good governance and the code of
best practice within the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
General policy
The committee and the board recognise that in order to attract, retain and motivate talented senior executives it
is necessary to operate a competitive pay and benefits structure. The committee aims to reward executives fairly
and responsibly for their contribution to the company's performance but avoids paying more than necessary to
achieve this objective.
In setting all elements of remuneration, the committee is guided both by published surveys and by specific studies
commissioned from time to time by the committee from independent specialist consultants. It takes professional
advice from within and outside the company. During the year, the committee has taken advice from Monks
Partnership (the Executive & Management Pay Group of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP) on market practice with
regard to basic salary and for above earnings cap pension provision. Advice has been taken from Eversheds LLP on
certain aspects of executive directors' contracts.
The committee does receive and consider general information on pay and employment conditions around the
group, especially when determining annual salary increases.
Performance related pay
The committee and the board seek to link a significant proportion of the remuneration package to individual specific
performance and to the financial performance of the group. The policy of the committee is to align directors' interests
with those of shareholders and to give these executives keen incentives to perform at the highest levels. 
Performance related elements of the remuneration package are the annual bonus schemes and the awards made
under the performance share plan. Further details of these benefits are set out below.
All directors are encouraged to be shareholders of the company.
Total shareholder return graph
Set out to the left is the graph showing the company's total shareholder return (TSR ) over the last five years. It
is compared to the TSR of the FTSE support services sector of which Brammer is a member. As the company has two
distinct divisions there are no direct comparative companies. The committee has selected this group as it combines
a wide number of diverse businesses which collectively provide a comparator group. 24  BRAMMER REMUNERATION REPORT
Remuneration of executive directors
The components of the remuneration packages for the executive directors are set out below. Mel Porter and Robert
Hough resigned during the year. Jean-Marie Fink resigned on 1 April 2004.
Basic salary
The committee seeks to pay salaries which take account of individual performance and are similar to those paid
in comparable companies. The committee uses comparisons with caution to avoid increasing remuneration levels
without a corresponding improvement in performance. Basic salary is reviewed at 31 December each year.
Annual bonus
The committee sets bonus targets to create incentives for executive directors to perform at the highest level and
to align their interests with those of shareholders. Bonuses are not pensionable.
On the achievement of quantified financial and non-financial targets, awards of up to 60% of annual salary can be
made. Maximum bonus will only be paid in years of exceptional performance. For 2003 the remuneration committee
set a performance related bonus scheme for executive directors based on achieving stretching earnings per share
and cash production targets. Up to 35% of salary will be payable for achieving the earnings per share target and
15% for achieving the group cash production target. A maximum of 10% of salary would be awarded, for the
achievement of challenging personal objectives. Targets are based on group performance for the year. In considering
executive bonus payments for 2003 the committee was mindful of group performance during the year.
The bonus scheme for 2004 is set on principles similar to those in the 2003 scheme save that Ian Fraser will be entitled
to a maximum award of 70% of annual salary.
Executive share option schemes 
The company currently operates executive share option schemes which were approved by shareholders in 1995 and
1997. The 1997 scheme has been approved by the Inland Revenue. Under these schemes executive directors and
senior executives have been granted options to acquire ordinary shares in the company after a period of three
years from date of grant. The committee considers the performance criteria on each occasion that options are
granted. It seeks to set targets which are in line with market practice and align the interests of these directors with
shareholders. Options may not be granted at an option price less than the market value at the date of grant. Details
of the performance targets are set out in the notes to the share option table below. On each occasion that options
are granted, the committee reviews the performance targets taking account of market practice. When the
committee believes it to be appropriate it will take external advice.
In determining whether performance targets have been met the earnings per share figures are taken from the
published accounts and the published retail price index for the same period.
There are a small number of executive share options which do not have attaching performance targets. These
options were granted in 1994 and 1995 when best practice did not require performance targets to be set.
Performance share plan
The Brammer plc Performance Share Plan (the Plan ) enables executive directors and senior executives to acquire
shares in the company, at no cost, upon the achievement of performance targets. Awards under the Plan are
subject to earnings per share growth targets. The target is set by the committee having taken external advice on
market practice. Participants only receive the full award, which for directors equates to 75% of their basic salary,
if the company's earnings per share over three financial years has increased by 40% in real terms. Earnings per share
has to increase by at least 15% in real terms for the director or executive to receive any shares. If shares are awarded,
directors and executives are expected to retain at least 50% of them for three years. Participants in the Plan will
not receive options under the company's executive share option schemes.
The UK executive directors may participate in the savings related share option scheme which was approved by
shareholders in 1999. This scheme is approved by the Inland Revenue.
In the light of the management restructure, following the disposal of the Livingston division, the remuneration
committee is undertaking a comprehensive review of the short term and long term reward structure.

Notes
1 No performance related conditions apply to these options.
2 Performance related conditions apply to these options. These criteria provide that options can normally only be
exercised if, in any period of three consecutive financial years commencing no earlier than the beginning of the
financial year in which the option is granted, the growth in the earnings per share of the company has exceeded
the retail price index by 2% per annum during the same period.
3 The performance target for these options is based on the growth in normalised consolidated fully diluted earnings
per share, before goodwill, of the group. Growth will be tested after three years. The options will be exercisable
if the growth has exceeded the retail price index by at least 9%. If the condition is not met, it can be retested
in the fourth or fifth financial year when growth must be at least 12% or 15% respectively.
4 These options are subject to a similar performance target to note 3 above, save that the growth has to exceed
the growth in the retail price index by at least 5% per annum.
5 The middle market price of an ordinary share at the close of business on 7 April 2004 was 126.5p. The range of
prices during the year was 75p to 178p and at 31 December 2003 the price was 141p.
6 It is not appropriate to apply a future notional value to these share options as the option prices are below the
current share price. 26  BRAMMER REMUNERATION REPORT

There were no changes in the above-mentioned interests between 1 January 2004 and 7 April 2004.
No director was materially interested in any contract of significance with the company during the year, save that
Jean-Marie Fink had an interest in four properties which are leased to Roulement Service SAS. The terms of the
leases were agreed prior to Jean-Marie Fink becoming a member of the board and all of them are considered by
the directors to be on acceptable terms and at fair market rents. The total annual rental cost of these properties
during the year was  321,240 (2002  302,113).
Remuneration of non-executive directors
The chairman and the other non-executive directors are paid fees for their services. These directors are paid a standard
fee of  17,500 with further fees being payable for additional responsibilities such as being a member or chairman
of a committee. These fees are related to the time spent on the company's business and are set at levels similar to
those of comparable companies. The non-executive directors, including the chairman, do not participate in bonus,
option or pension schemes and they do not receive any benefits in kind.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors, other than the chairman, is determined by the board on the
recommendation of the chairman and the chief executive. The remuneration of the chairman is determined by
the board on the recommendation of the other non-executive directors. In both cases the recommendations are
supported by independent advice. Consideration is given to the time commitment and responsibilities of the roles.
Service contracts
Each of the executive directors has a service contract with the company.
Contract date Notice period
Jean-Marie Fink 6 August 1992 Renewable for 1 year periods from 6 August
Ian Fraser 1 July 1998 Rolling 2 years
David Hollywood 22 October 1990 Rolling 2 years
Paul Thwaite 24 January 2002 Rolling 1 year 27  BRAMMER REMUNERATION REPORT
When considering these contracts, the committee has due regard to the provisions of the Combined Code. The
committee does consider it desirable to reduce notice periods to one year. In line with this policy when Paul
Thwaite was appointed a director in May 2002 his contract included a one-year notice period. It is the committee's
intention, where appropriate, to follow this policy for any future appointments.
If a contract is to be terminated, the committee will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in
each circumstance and the compensation that may be paid. It will take into account the best practice provisions of
the Combined Code and it will take legal advice on the company's liability to pay compensation and the appropriate
amount. For the executive directors who have left the company in recent years, the remuneration committee has
adopted a robust policy and has applied mitigation as far as it fair and reasonable in each circumstance.
During the year, the service contracts for Ian Fraser, David Hollywood and Paul Thwaite were extended to each contain
a liquidated damages clause. In the event of a change of control of the company, save in circumstances where their
employment is terminated by reason of retirement or where summary dismissal is warranted, the company is
obliged to pay to the director a sum representing basic salary, pension benefit, car allowance and bonus (based on
the average bonus payments made over the previous three years) for a period of one year.
The company's practice is to appoint non-executive directors under letters of engagement rather than under service
contracts. These letters of engagement set out terms of appointment, usually three years, and it is anticipated that
the period will be extended for a second term of three years with the agreement of the board and the non-executive
director, although re-appointment is not automatic. In certain circumstances non-executive directors may be invited
to serve for further terms if their continued appointment is considered to be in the interests of the company.
David Dunn was appointed in November 2001. His appointment is for a period of three years from 30 April 2002.
Kevin Mellor's initial term of appointment expired in February 2000 and was extended for a further term of three
years. Chris Conway was appointed in October 1997 again for an initial term of three years. His appointment was
extended for a further term of three years in November 2000.
Shareholders renewed both of these appointments, for a third period of three years, at the annual general meeting
in 2003.
Robert Hough retired on 18 December 2003 having served ten years as a non-executive director.
Directors' remuneration and emoluments
The remuneration and taxable benefits in kind of the directors in the year ended 31 December 2003 are set out below.
In addition to these emoluments, Ian Fraser, David Hollywood, Mel Porter and Paul Thwaite received payments in
respect of salary in excess of the earnings cap. Details of these payments are set out in the pension section below.

4 Mel Porter resigned as a director on 11 March 2003 and left the company on this date. He received  100,100
compensation for loss of office and a payment of  1,847 for loss of medical insurance.
5 Full details of payments made in lieu of pension contributions are set out in the directors' pension entitlements
section below.
6 The total amount paid to directors, including amounts paid to Mel Porter after his resignation as a director, were
 1,228,947 (2002  1,319,000).
Directors' pension entitlements
Paul Thwaite participates in an approved defined contribution pension scheme (DC Scheme ) which the company
introduced in January 2002. The scheme is open to UK employees joining the group after 1 January 2002. The
company has contracted to contribute 15% of the earnings cap, representing  14,783, into the DC Scheme for him.
The other UK based executive directors participate in a defined benefit non-contributory pension scheme governed
by an independent trust. The scheme is approved by the Inland Revenue. The scheme provides, at normal retirement
age of 62, and subject to length of service, a pension of up to 2/3rds of pensionable salary at retirement, subject
to a minimum of 20 years' service with the company and to Inland Revenue limits. Details of the pension benefits
accrued during the year are set out below.
The following directors are members of this scheme and have accrued defined benefits during 2003

For both the defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements, pension entitlement is calculated by reference
to basic salary only (subject to the earnings cap) and neither annual bonuses nor benefits in kind are pensionable.
The dependants of each of the UK executive directors are eligible for dependants' pensions and payments of a lump
sum in the event of death in service.
Ian Fraser, David Hollywood, Mel Porter and Paul Thwaite's pensions from the pension schemes are affected by the
Inland Revenue earnings cap on approved pension benefits. The company established funded unapproved top-up
arrangements (FURB ) for Ian Fraser, David Hollywood and Mel Porter. The contributions in 2003 were
