1 Introduction
This report has been prepared in compliance
with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority and the disclosure provisions under
Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985.
In accordance with these provisions, a
resolution to approve the report will be
proposed at the Company's Annual General
Meeting in July.  Details of the resolution can
be found in the notice set out on page 65 
of this report.  
As identified in the headings, 
certain of the following information has 
been audited by the Company's auditors,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , as required by
Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
2 Remuneration Committee (unaudited)
During the year, the Remuneration Committee
comprised of Non-Executive Directors and
includes the Non-Executive Chairman.  They
are as follows: Dr J Rowell, Sir C T Evans
and Dr D R Pearce.  In June 2007, the
Remuneration Committee was restructured 
to comprise two independent Non-Executive
Directors.  They are Peter Jensen, Chairman
of the Remuneration Committee, and
Nicholas Badman.  The Company Secretary
is the secretary of the Committee.  The
Committee met three times during the year
and seeks independent advice, where
appropriate, for the purpose of determining
all aspects of the remuneration of Executive
Directors.  No Director is directly involved 
in determining his or her own level of
remuneration. 
The Company's Remuneration
Committee decides the remuneration policy
that applies to all Executive Directors
(including the award of annual bonuses 
and share options) and the terms of their
service agreements.  The Committee also
recommends to the Board the fees paid 
to the Non-Executive Chairman.
3 Remuneration policy (unaudited)
3.1 Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors have letters of
appointment with the Company, which are
reviewed on an annual basis with no fixed
term.  The remuneration of the Non-Executive
Directors is set by the Remuneration
Committee by reference to fees paid by other 
companies of similar size and complexity.  
The Non-Executive Chairman's fee 
is  40,000 per annum ($76,380) and the
Non-Executive Directors' fees are  22,000
per annum ($42,009) plus  3,000 per
annum ($5,728) as a supplement when a
Non-Executive Director chairs a Board sub-
committee.  Non-Executive Directors are not
eligible to participate in bonus or share
incentive arrangements and their service
does not qualify for pension purposes or
other benefits.  No element of their fees 
is performance-related.
3.2 Remuneration policy for Executive
Directors (unaudited)
The Remuneration Committee in its
deliberations on the remuneration policy for
the Group's Directors gives full consideration
to the Combined Code including the
provisions set out in Schedule A to that code.
The Committee also monitors developments
in the accounting for equity-based
remuneration on an ongoing basis.
In setting the remuneration policy 
the Committee considers a number of factors
including:
(a) the basic salaries and benefits
available to Executive Directors of
comparable companies;
(b) the need to attract and retain
Executive Directors of an appropriate calibre;
and
(c) the need to ensure Executive
Directors' commitment to the continued
success of the Company by means of
incentive schemes.
Consequently, the Company's
remuneration policy for Executive Directors
is:
(a) having regard to the Directors'
experience and the nature and complexity 
of their work, to pay a competitive salary
that attracts and retains management of 
the highest quality;
(b) to link individual remuneration
packages to the Company's long-term
performance through the award of share
options and establishment of incentive
schemes;
(c) to provide post-retirement benefits;
(d) to provide employment related
benefits, including the provision of a
company car and life assurance.
3.3 Salary and benefits (unaudited)
The Remuneration Committee considers 
and sets the annual salaries for Executive
Directors.  The nature of the Group's
development has meant that there has 
been a good deal of focus on the attainment
of short-term objectives with a certain level 
of variable remuneration.  Currently, the
variable remuneration consists of two
fundamental elements: annual cash bonus
and discretionary share options.  Both 
these incentives are performance-related.
3.4 Annual cash bonus (unaudited)
For payments to be earned by Executive
Directors under the performance-related 
cash incentive plan, specific objectives
relating to Company performance must be
met.  The maximum amount payable on
target performance is 50% of annual salary.
During the year payments were made under
the scheme which comprise an overall 43%
of annual salary (2006: 33.75% of annual
salary).  The objectives are primarily focused
on profitability measures and are decided 
for each individual on a case by case basis.
3.5 Share options (unaudited)
Share options are granted by the
Remuneration Committee to employees and
Directors of the Company in order to provide
appropriate incentives and to promote
employee ownership in the Company.
Specific details of individual Directors' 
share options are detailed on page 23.
3.5.1 Long term incentive plan (unaudited)
The 2005 Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
was approved by shareholders in July 2005.
Vesting of awards will be triggered if, over
the first three years following the date of
award, earnings per share (EPS) and total
shareholder return (TSR) performance targets
are met.
2005 Performance shares (unaudited)
Each year the Executive Directors or 
any Senior Manager selected by the
Remuneration Committee are eligible to
receive an award worth up to 100% of their
annual base salary.  Under exceptional
circumstances the Remuneration Committee
may award up to a maximum of 200% of
any eligible director's or employee's annual
base salary.

Performance targets (unaudited)
EPS Target
50% of the initial award will be subject to
EPS growth target measured over the three
financial years ending within three years of
the award date.  30% of this part of the
award will vest where growth in EPS is equal
to RPIX+5% per annum (where RPIX is the
retail price index excluding mortgage interest
payments), and 100% of this part of the
award will vest where growth in EPS is equal
to or greater than RPIX+12.5% per annum.
Between these levels the proportion
of the award that vests will be calculated on
a straight line basis.  EPS growth will be
measured on an average basis, taking into
account each year the relevant measurement
period.
TSR Target
50% of the initial awards will be subject 
to TSR targets measured over a three year
period.  If the Company's TSR at the end of 
the measurement period is ranked within the
upper quartile of the companies which form
the techMARK Mediscience Index at the start
of the measurement period then the whole of
this part of the award will vest. 
If the Company's TSR is at or above
the median of the comparator companies,
30% of this part of the award will vest.
Between these levels the award will vest 
on a straight line basis.
EPS and TSR are the chosen
performance measures as the Committee 
has considered that it provides a clear link 
to the growth of the Group's activities and
the creation of shareholder value.
The techMARK Mediscience
comparator index has been chosen as it 
is a large enough group to give meaning 
to a quartile-analysis and comprises a fair
balance of companies with a greater and
smaller market capitalisation to that of the
Company.
3.5.2 1996 Unapproved Share Option Plan
(unaudited)
Options granted prior to July 2005 to the
Executive Directors were under the 1996
Unapproved Share Option Plan.  Options
granted under this plan can only be
exercised if the growth in pre-tax earnings
per share exceeds RPIX by 12.5% per
annum.
3.5.3 2006 Unapproved Share Option Plan
(unaudited)
The 2006 Share Option Plan Performance
Share Plan (PSP) was approved by
shareholders on 26 July 2006 for Executive
Directors and other senior employees to
replace the 1996 Unapproved Share Option
Scheme, which expired in 2006.  Vesting 
of awards will be triggered if, over the first
three years following the date of award,
performance targets are met.
All options granted at 1 April 2005 were
granted under the 1996 Unapproved
Scheme (see note 23).
All options granted after 1 April
2005 were granted under the Performance
Share Plan adopted on 26 July 2005.
All options initially granted for shares
of 1p have been converted into 5p shares
and their original number divided by 5 on
31 August 2005.
The market price of the Company's
shares at the end of the financial year was
222p and the range of market prices during
the year was between 158p and 233p.
None of the terms and conditions of
the share options was varied during the year.
Both Executive Directors beneficially own, 
or have options over, 1% or more of the
outstanding shares under the Performance
Share Plan and the Approved and
Unapproved Celsis share options schemes,
but they do not have different voting rights 
to other shareholders.

6 Service contracts (unaudited)
For both Executive Directors their contracts
are terminable at any time by the Company
giving 12 months' notice or by the Director
giving six months' notice.  The calculation of
early termination payments are based on
these contractual provisions.  These service
contracts provide for each of the Directors to 
provide services to the Group on a full-time
basis. 
The agreements contain restrictive
covenants for a period of 12 months
following termination of employment relating
to non-competition and non-solicitation of 
the Group's employees.  In addition, each
service contract contains an express
obligation of confidentiality in respect of 
the Group's trade secrets and confidential
information and provides for the Group to
own any intellectual property rights created
by the Directors in the course of their
employment.
The dates of the service contracts 
of each person who served as an Executive
Director during the financial year are as
follows:
The Directors' beneficial interests in the

8 Performance graph (unaudited)
A performance graph showing 
the Group's total shareholder return (TSR)
together with the FTSE All Share Index from
11 June 2002 is shown below.  The TSR 
is being calculated in accordance with the
Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations
