Company's auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ,
as required by Schedule 7A to the Companies Act
1985.
2 Remuneration committee (unaudited)
During the first quarter of the year, the
Remuneration Committee comprised of Non-
Executive Directors and included the Non-Executive
Chairman.  They were as follows: D Pearce, 
Dr J Rowell and Sir Christopher Evans.  In June
2007, the Remuneration Committee was
restructured to comprise two independent Non-
Executive Directors.  They are P Jensen, Chairman
of the Remuneration Committee, and N Badman.
The Company Secretary is the secretary of the
Committee.  The Committee met three times during
the year, with each member attending.  The
Committee seeks independent advice, where
appropriate, for the purpose of determining all
aspects of the remuneration of Executive Directors.
No Director is directly involved in determining his
or her own level of remuneration. 
The Company's Remuneration Committee
decides the remuneration policy that applies to all
Executive Directors (including the award of annual
bonuses and share options) and the terms of their
service agreements.  The Committee also
recommends to the Board the fees paid to the
Non-Executive Chairman.
3 Remuneration policy (unaudited)
3.1 Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Chairman and Non-Executive
Directors have letters of appointment with the
Company, which are reviewed on an annual basis
with no fixed term.  The remuneration of the Non-
Executive Directors is set by the Remuneration
Committee by reference to fees paid by other
companies of similar size and complexity.  
The Non-Executive Chairman's fee 
is  40,000 per annum ($80,524) and the Non-
Executive Directors' fees are  22,000 per annum
($44,288) plus  8,000 per annum ($16,105) as
a supplement when a Non-Executive Director
chairs a Board sub-committee.  Non-Executive
Directors are not eligible to participate in bonus or
share incentive arrangements and their service
does not qualify for pension purposes or other
benefits.  No element of their fees is performance-
related.
3.2 Remuneration policy for Executive Directors
(unaudited)
The Remuneration Committee in its deliberations
on the remuneration policy for the Group's
Directors gives full consideration to the Combined
Code including the provisions set out in Schedule
A to that code.  The Committee also monitors
developments in the accounting for equity-based
remuneration on an ongoing basis.
In setting the remuneration policy the
Committee considers a number of factors
including:
(a) the basic salaries and benefits
available to Executive Directors of comparable
companies;
(b) the need to attract and retain
Executive Directors of an appropriate calibre; and
(c) the need to ensure Executive Directors'
commitment to the continued success of the
Company by means of incentive schemes.
Consequently, the Company's
remuneration policy for Executive Directors is:
(a) having regard to the Directors'
experience and the nature and complexity of their
work, to pay a competitive salary that attracts and
retains management of the highest quality;
(b) to link individual remuneration
packages to the Company's long-term
performance through the award of share options
and establishment of incentive schemes;
(c) to provide post-retirement benefits;
(d) to provide employment related
benefits, including the provision of a company car
and life assurance.
3.3 Salary and benefits (unaudited)
The Remuneration Committee considers and sets
the annual salaries for Executive Directors.  The
nature of the Group's development has meant that
there has been a good deal of focus on the
attainment of short-term objectives with a certain
level of variable remuneration.  Currently, the
variable remuneration consists of two fundamental
elements: annual cash bonus and discretionary
share options.  Both these incentives are
performance-related.
3.4 Annual cash bonus (unaudited)
For payments to be earned by Executive Directors
under the performance-related cash incentive plan,
specific objectives relating to Company
performance must be met.  The maximum amount
payable on target performance is 75% of annual
salary.  During the year payments were made
under the scheme which comprise an overall 35%
of annual salary (2007: 43% of annual salary).
The objectives are primarily focused on profitability
measures and are decided for each individual on
a case by case basis.
3.5 Share options (unaudited)
Share options are granted by the Remuneration
Committee to employees and Directors of the
Company in order to provide appropriate
incentives and to promote employee ownership in
the Company.  Specific details of individual
Directors' share options are detailed on page 20.
3.5.1 Long term incentive plan (unaudited)
The 2005 Performance Share Plan (PSP) was
approved by shareholders in July 2005.  Vesting
of awards will be triggered if, over the first three
years following the date of award, earnings per
share (EPS) and total shareholder return (TSR)
performance targets are met.
2005 Performance shares (unaudited)
Each year the Executive Directors or any Senior
Manager selected by the Remuneration Committee
are eligible to receive an award worth up to
100% of their annual base salary.  Under
exceptional circumstances the Remuneration
Committee may award up to a maximum of 200%
of any eligible director's or employee's annual
base salary.
Performance targets (unaudited)
EPS target
50% of the initial award will be subject to EPS
growth target measured over the three financial
years ending within three years of the award date.
30% of this part of the award will vest where
growth in EPS is equal to RPIX+5% per annum
(where RPIX is the retail price index excluding
mortgage interest payments), and 100% of this
part of the award will vest where growth in EPS is
equal to or greater than RPIX+12.5% per annum.
Between these levels the proportion of the
award that vests will be calculated on a straight
line basis.  EPS growth will be measured on an
average basis, taking into account each year the
relevant measurement period.
TSR target
50% of the initial awards will be subject to TSR
targets measured over a three year period.  If the
Company's TSR at the end of the measurement
period is ranked within the upper quartile of the
companies which form the techMARK Mediscience
Index at the start of the measurement period then
the whole of this part of the award will vest. 
If the Company's TSR is at or above the
median of the comparator companies, 30% of this
part of the award will vest.  Between these levels
the award will vest on a straight line basis.
EPS and TSR are the chosen performance
measures as the Committee has considered that it
provides a clear link to the growth of the Group's
activities and the creation of shareholder value.
Remuneration Report Celsis International plc Annual Report 2008 20
The techMARK Mediscience comparator
index has been chosen as it is a large enough
group to give meaning to a quartile-analysis and
comprises a fair balance of companies with a
greater and smaller market capitalisation to that 
of the Company.
3.5.2 1996 Unapproved Share Option Plan
(unaudited)
Options granted prior to July 2005 to the
Executive Directors were under the 1996
Unapproved Share Option Plan.  Options granted
under this plan can only be exercised if the growth
in pre-tax earnings per share exceeds RPIX by
12.5% per annum.
3.5.3 2006 Unapproved Share Option Plan
(unaudited)
The 2006 Share Option Plan Performance Share
Plan (PSP) was approved by shareholders on 26
July 2006 for Executive Directors and other senior
employees to replace the 1996 Unapproved
Share Option Scheme, which expired in 2006.
Vesting of awards will be triggered if, over the first
three years following the date of award,
performance targets are met.
