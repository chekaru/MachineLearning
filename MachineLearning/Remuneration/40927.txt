THE FIGURES 22
1 Introduction
This report has been prepared in compliance
with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority and the disclosure provisions under
Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985. In
accordance with these provisions, a resolution
to approve the report will be proposed at the
Company's Annual General Meeting in July.
Details of the resolution can be found in the
notice set out on page 63 of this report.
As identified in the headings, certain of the
following information has been audited by the
Company's auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, as required by Schedule 7A to the
Companies Act 1985.
2 Remuneration Committee (unaudited)
During the year, the Remuneration Committee
comprised of the independent Non-Executive
Directors, Peter Jensen, Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee, and Nicholas
Badman. Subsequent to Mr Badman's and Mr
Jensen's resignations, Mr Barnes has been
appointed chairman of the Remuneration
Committee. The Company Secretary is the
secretary of the Committee. The Committee met
six times during the year, with each member
attending. The Committee seeks independent
advice, where appropriate, for the purpose of
determining all aspects of the remuneration of
Executive Directors. No Director is directly
involved in determining his or her own level of
remuneration.
The Company's Remuneration Committee
decides the remuneration policy that applies to
all Executive Directors (including the award of
annual bonuses and share options) and the
terms of their service agreements. The
Committee also recommends to the Board the
fees paid to the Non-Executive Chairman.
3 Remuneration policy (unaudited)
3.1 Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors have letters of appointment
with the Company, which are reviewed on an
annual basis with no fixed term. The
remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is
set by the Remuneration Committee by
reference to fees paid by other companies of
similar size and complexity.
The Non-Executive Chairman's fee is  50,000
per annum ($85,185) and the Non-Executive
Directors' fees are  22,000 per annum
($37 ,481) plus  8,000 per annum ($13,630)
as a supplement when a Non-Executive
Director chairs a Board sub-committee. Non-
Executive Directors are not eligible to
participate in bonus or share incentive
arrangements and their service does not qualify
for pension purposes or other benefits. No
element of their fees is performance-related.
3.2 Remuneration policy for Executive Directors
(unaudited)
The Remuneration Committee in its
deliberations on the remuneration policy for the
Group's Directors gives full consideration to the
Combined Code including the provisions set
out in Schedule A to that code. The Committee
also monitors developments in the accounting
for equity-based remuneration on an ongoing
basis.
In setting the remuneration policy the
Committee considers a number of factors
including:
(a) the basic salaries and benefits available to
Executive Directors of comparable
companies;
(b) the need to attract and retain Executive
Directors of an appropriate calibre; and
(c) the need to ensure Executive Directors'
commitment to the continued success of the
Company by means of incentive schemes.
Consequently, the Company's remuneration
policy for Executive Directors is:
(a) having regard to the Directors' experience
and the nature and complexity of their
work, to pay a competitive salary that
attracts and retains management of the
highest quality;
(b) to link individual remuneration packages to
the Company's long-term performance
through the award of share options and
establishment of incentive schemes;
(c) to provide post-retirement benefits; and
(d) to provide employment related benefits,
including the provision of a company car
and life assurance.
3.3 Salary and benefits (unaudited)
The Remuneration Committee considers and
sets the annual salaries for Executive Directors.
The nature of the Group's development has
meant that there has been a good deal of
focus on the attainment of short-term objectives
with a certain level of variable remuneration.
Currently, the variable remuneration consists of
two fundamental elements: annual cash bonus
and discretionary share options. Both these
incentives are performance-related.
3.4 Annual cash bonus (unaudited)
For payments to be earned by Executive
Directors under the performance-related cash
incentive plan, specific objectives relating to
Company performance must be met. The
maximum amount payable on target
performance is 75% of annual salary. During
the year payments were made under the
scheme which comprise an overall 42% of
annual salary (2008: 35% of annual salary).
The objectives are primarily focused on
profitability measures and are decided for each
individual on a case by case basis.
3.5 Share options (unaudited)
Share options are granted by the Remuneration
Committee to employees and Directors of the
Company in order to provide appropriate
incentives and to promote employee ownership
in the Company. Specific details of individual
Directors' share options are detailed on
page 23.
3.5.1 Long-term incentive plan - 2005
Performance shares (unaudited)
The 2005 Performance Share Plan (PSP) was
approved by shareholders in July 2005.
Vesting of awards will be triggered if, over the
first three years following the date of award,
earnings per share (EPS) and total shareholder
return (TSR) performance targets are met.
Each year the Executive Directors or any Senior
Manager selected by the Remuneration
Committee are eligible to receive an award
worth up to 100% of their annual base salary.
Under exceptional circumstances the
Remuneration Committee may award up to a
maximum of 200% of any eligible director's or
employee's annual base salary.
Performance targets (unaudited)
EPS Target
50% of the initial award will be subject to EPS
growth target measured over the three financial
years ending within three years of the award
date. 30% of this part of the award will vest
where growth in EPS is equal to RPIX+5% per
annum (where RPIX is the retail price index
excluding mortgage interest payments), and
100% of this part of the award will vest where
growth in EPS is equal to or greater than
RPIX+12.5% per annum.
Between these levels the proportion of the
award that vests will be calculated on a
straight line basis. EPS growth will be
measured on an average basis, taking into
account each year the relevant measurement
period.

HIGHLIGHTS
AND OVERVIEW 23
All options granted at 1 April 2005 were
granted under the 1996 Unapproved Scheme
(see note 23).
All options granted after 1 April 2005 were
granted under the Performance Share Plan
adopted on 26 July 2005.
The market price of the Company's shares at
the end of the financial year was 165.00p
and the range of market prices during the year
was between 129.0p and 179.0p .
None of the terms and conditions of the share
options was varied during the year. Both
Executive Directors beneficially own, or have
options over, 1% or more of the outstanding
shares under the Performance Share Plan and
the Approved and Unapproved Celsis share
option schemes, but they do not have different
voting rights to other shareholders.
5 Pension schemes (unaudited)
J LeCoque and C Madrolle are currently
members of the Group's defined contribution
pension scheme. The cost of the Company's
contributions to this scheme in relation to
J LeCoque and C Madrolle is disclosed on
page 25.
6 Service contracts (unaudited)
For both Executive Directors their contracts are
terminable at any time by the Company giving
12 months' notice or by the Director giving six
months' notice. The calculation of early
termination payments are based on these
contractual provisions. These service contracts
provide for each of the Directors to provide
services to the Group on a full-time basis.
The agreements contain restrictive covenants for
a period of 12 months following termination of
employment relating to non-competition and
non-solicitation of the Group's employees. In
addition, each service contract contains an
express obligation of confidentiality in respect
of the Group's trade secrets and confidential
information and provides for the Group to own
any intellectual property rights created by the
Directors in the course of their employment.
TSR target
50% of the initial awards will be subject to TSR
targets measured over a three year period. If
the Company's TSR at the end of the
measurement period is ranked within the upper
quartile of the companies which form the
techMARK Mediscience Index at the start of
the measurement period then the whole of this
part of the award will vest.
If the Company's TSR is at or above the
median of the comparator companies, 30% of
this part of the award will vest. Between these
levels the award will vest on a straight line
basis.
EPS and TSR are the chosen performance
measures as the Committee has considered
that it provides a clear link to the growth of the
Group's activities and the creation of
shareholder value.
The techMARK Mediscience comparator index
has been chosen as it is a large enough group
to give meaning to a quartile-analysis and
comprises a fair balance of companies with a
greater and smaller market capitalisation to
that of the Company.
3.5.2 1996 Unapproved Share Option Plan
(unaudited)
Options granted prior to July 2005 to the
Executive Directors were under the 1996
Unapproved Share Option Plan. Options
granted under this plan can only be exercised
if the growth in pre-tax earnings per share
exceeds RPIX by 12.5% per annum.
3.5.3 2006 Unapproved Share Option Plan
(unaudited)
The 2006 Share Option Plan Performance
Share Plan (PSP) was approved by
shareholders on 26 July 2006 for Executive
Directors and other senior employees to
replace the 1996 Unapproved Share Option
Scheme, which expired in 2006. Vesting of
awards will be triggered if, over the first three
years following the date of award,
performance targets are met.
