REMUNERATION REPORT

The Directors submit their report on remuneration for the financial year ended 30 June 2003. This report has been 
approved and adopted by the Board and prepared in accordance with applicable regulations and the Listing Rules. The 
information contained within the tables on pages 19 and 20 and the paragraphs entitled Pension  and Share options  
below is subject to audit in accordance with The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. 
 
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee ) 
 
The Committee had 4 members during the year: Dermot F Desmond (Chairman), Brian Quinn, Sir Patrick Sheehy and 
Tom Allison and meets at least 3 times each year. It considers, for recommendation to the Board, Company policy on 
remuneration of Directors and approves on behalf of the Board,  the content and level of the remuneration packages of 
executive directors and certain other senior executives.  
 
Remuneration Policy 
 
The Company complies with the provisions of the Combined Code in connection with executive remuneration in force 
during this financial year. In determining policy, the main objective is to ensure, without paying more than is reasonable 
or necessary, that the Company can attract, retain and motivate experienced and capable individuals who will make a 
significant contribution to the Company's success. When determining policy and remuneration account is taken of  levels 
of packages available within other comparable companies, the Company's overall corporate performance, achievement of 
corporate objectives and individual  performance. 
 
The Committee has received information and advice in the course of the year from Macdonald Kinnaird, Recruitment 
Consultants on executive director and senior executive remuneration levels.  This firm also provided recruitment services 
to the Company during the financial year.  It is Company policy that executive Directors' service contracts should be 
terminable on no more than one year's notice and that pre-determined compensation on termination, or for loss of office, 
should not exceed one year's salary and benefits. 
 
Appointments may, for the purpose of continuity, provide for an initial period of up to two years but reverting thereafter 
to rolling periods, terminable as explained above. 
 
Performance related remuneration for executive directors and senior executives is assessed through an annual bonus 
scheme (see below) and the operation of the Celtic plc Executive Share Option Scheme. 
 
Remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Executives 
 
Payments to Directors in the financial year are set out in the table on page 20 and demonstrate the relative values of basic 
salary and performance based remuneration. Executive remuneration packages consist of several elements: 
 
Basic salary and benefits 
 
The Committee reviews base salaries for executive directors and senior executives annually, on promotion and 
exceptionally during the year if significant additional responsibilities have been undertaken. Benefits for executive 
directors include the provision of a company vehicle, fuel, relocation allowance, private medical insurance and critical 
illness cover and may be extended to senior executives. Those receiving such benefits are assessed for income tax on 
them.  
 
The Company allows all regular employees  a discount on Company merchandise and products. 
 
Annual Performance Related Bonus Scheme 
 
The Group  operates a bonus scheme for all full and part time employees on regular contracts with the following key 
objectives: 
 
(A) Improving and sustaining the financial performance of the Group from year to year; 
 
(B) Delivering and enhancing shareholder value;  
 
(C) Enhancing the reputation and standing of Celtic; 
 
(D) Delivering consistently high standards of service to Celtic and its customers; and

(E) Attracting, retaining and motivating talented individuals whose skills and services will enable Celtic to meet its 
strategic objectives. 
 
 
Performance conditions reflect both corporate financial performance and satisfaction of personal objectives. Corporate 
financial performance incorporates both performance against budget and the previous year's results.  Maximum award 
levels depend upon seniority and contractual entitlements. The maximum award under the scheme for executive directors 
is 75% of salary.  The Committee reviews the bonus scheme structure and performance conditions annually. Football 
players are subject to a separate bonus scheme that rewards on-field success. 
 
Pension 
 
The Company  operates a group personal pension plan, with defined contributions, in which the Financial Director,  
several  senior executives and a number of other employees participate. Pension contributions for Ian McLeod during his 
tenure as Chief Executive were made  to independent pension providers. Stakeholder arrangements are available to 
qualifying employees.  The Company does not operate any defined benefit (final salary) schemes.  
 
Share options 
 
The Celtic  plc Executive Share Option Scheme (the Scheme ) is operated by the Company as part of remuneration  
policy and to assist in aligning the interests of executive Directors and selected employees  with the Company's financial 
performance. The Scheme was first established in December 1994 and last amended in September 2001 and has 2 parts; 
an Approved Scheme and an Unapproved Scheme. The Unapproved Scheme operates to permit the grant of options 
where the value of subsisting options at the date of grant exceeds the Inland Revenue threshold of  30,000.  
 
Employees in participating group companies and directors devoting substantially all of their working time to the group's 
affairs are eligible to participate, subject to the discretion of the Committee.  
 
The last grant of options over Ordinary Shares of 1p  under the Scheme was on 15 September 2001, all  at an option price 
of  107.5p. Those options,  including those of the Directors, are exercisable in total only after 3 years from the date of 
grant (in effect, only after 15 September 2004), and provided that over 3 consecutive financial years 
 
 the increase in market value of the Company's shares would place the Company in the top one third of companies 
within the Leisure, Entertainment and Hotels sector of the FTSE; and 
  
 if the percentage growth in earnings per share over 3 consecutive financial years exceeds percentage growth in RPI 
over the same period by an average of at least 3% per year.  
  
The performance criteria stated above were selected by the Committee as a realistic test of comparative financial 
performance, with a view to securing consistent growth and shareholder return against the sector. In accordance with the 
rules of the Scheme these options, unless exercised or lapsing earlier, lapse on the tenth anniversary of the date of the 
grant. 
 
The interests of executive Directors serving during the year under the Scheme are set out in the table below:

A total of 1,140,093 options over Ordinary Shares of 1p from the grant in September 2001, including those granted to 
executive Directors,  lapsed during the year, leaving 1,278,120 outstanding. 
 
Options over 1,538,461 Convertible Preferred Ordinary Shares of  1 were granted to the Football Manager in September 
2001 at an exercise price of 130p.  These options, in addition to parameters stated above, are also subject to conditions 
relating to football success and remain current. 
 
On 24 April 1997, certain employees were granted options over Ordinary Shares (then having a nominal value of  1.00 
each, now 1p each) at the market value on that date of  3.00.  At the balance sheet date, options from that grant over 
90,000 Ordinary Shares of 1p were in existence.  These options are exercisable at any time between 24 April 2002 and 24 
April 2007 and are not subject to performance conditions.

The market price of  Ordinary Shares on 30 June 2003 was 40.0p (2002: 51.5p).  The price range during the year was 
31.5p to 52.0p. 
 
The market price of the Convertible Preferred Ordinary Shares on 30 June 2003 was 97.5p (2002: 123.5p)  and the price 
range during the year was 97.5p to 123.5p. 
 
Service Agreements 
 
Executive Directors 
The service agreement of Ian McLeod was brought to an end on 30 April 2003. Mr McLeod had a contractual entitlement 
that if on the second anniversary of the date of grant of his share options in September 2001, the options did not have a 
built in gain of at least  400,000, the Company would pay Mr McLeod a cash sum equal to the shortfall.  The service 
agreement also provided for that payment to be made if the agreement terminated prior to the second anniversary of the 
date of grant. In consequence, the Company  made a payment to Mr McLeod after deduction of tax in relation to the 
underwritten capital gain obligations. Provision had previously been made on a pro rata basis against the likelihood of 
this payment arising as a result of the prevailing market price of the Ordinary Shares. 
 
Under severance terms agreed with Mr McLeod an additional payment of  100,000 was made to him in respect of 
liabilities which the Company considered and was advised would have arisen as a consequence of his contract being 
brought to an end. Mr McLeod remained entitled to the use of a fully expensed Company car for the period up to 31 July 
2003. All other benefits ceased with effect from 30 April 2003. 
 
The Financial Director's service agreement commenced on 19 August 1994 and continues subject to termination on 
twelve months' notice from the Company or three months' notice from the Financial Director.  Termination by the 
Company on shorter notice, other than for misconduct, would be likely to create a requirement for payment of 
compensation related to the unexpired element of the notice period. 
 
Non-executive Directors 
The Chairman and non-executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company. Individual letters govern 
their appointments. Although typically expected to serve for at least 3 years, non-executive Directors are not appointed 
for specific periods.

Bonus
Pension 
Contributions
 
The bonus payment awarded to Mr Riley includes a payment for additional temporary responsibilities undertaken during 
the year. 
 
Remuneration of non-executive Directors consists of fees for service on the Board and its committees and is reviewed by 
the Board as a whole each year against fees in comparable companies of a similar size and taking account of overall 
financial performance of the Company. The non-executive Directors have no personal financial interest other than as 
shareholders.  They are not members of the Company's pension scheme and do not participate in any bonus scheme, 
share option or other profit schemes.  All Directors are entitled to one seat in the Presidential  Box for each home match, 
without charge to assist them in performing their duties. 
 
The Company Chairman is entitled to take up to 50% of his fees in Ordinary Shares of the Company and has the use of a 
Company car and driver on Company business.    Celtic plc

Shareholder Return 
 
The graph below compares the total shareholder return for and investment in the Ordinary Shares of Celtic plc with the 
return for the same investment in FTSE Leisure and Hotels index over a five year period commencing on 1 July 1998.  In 
the opinion of the Directors, the FTSE Leisure and Hotels index, of which the Company is a constituent, is currently the 
most appropriate index against which the total shareholder return of the Company should be measured, as it is most likely 
to be used by investors, shareholders and management as a measure of performance.  This index includes other listed 
football clubs and is currently utilised as the benchmark against which performance under the Company's Executive 
Share Option Scheme is assessed.  Total shareholder return represents the increase in value of a share held by an investor 
assuming immediate reinvestment of dividends.

Review 
 
Stock market conditions remained difficult for the whole of the last financial year and in March 2003, the FTSE 100 
reached 3300 points, its lowest level since July 1995.  This also marked the low point for Celtic's share price for the 
period.  However, as at the the year end Company's share price had recovered by approximately 23 per cent and as at 13 
August 2003 by approximately 37%. 
 
The Board remains hopeful that continued success on the pitch combined with improving market conditions will see 
Celtic's share price moving in an upward direction. 
 
The Committee's Chairman will be available to answer questions concerning Directors' remuneration at the Company's 
Annual General Meeting.
