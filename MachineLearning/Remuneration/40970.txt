Remuneration
Report
This Report has been prepared in
accordance with applicable regulations
and the Listing Rules of the United
Kingdom Listing Authority. It has been
approved and adopted by the Board. The
information contained within the tables
on pages 20 and 22 and the paragraphs
entitled Pension  and Share options 
below has been subject to audit in
accordance with The Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
(the Committee )
The Committee met five times during the
year and has formal terms of reference
which are published on the Company's
website. The Committee members 
serving during the year are identified 
on page 16.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Company has complied with the
Combined Code, as applicable to the
financial year ended 30 June 2005, in
connection with executive remuneration
in force during this financial year. 
The main policy objective remains to
attract, retain and motivate experienced
and capable individuals who will make a
significant contribution to the Company's
success but without paying more than is
reasonable or necessary. 
When determining remuneration, account
is taken of the level of packages available
within other comparable companies and
sectors, the Company's performance
against budget in the year and against
actual performance from year to year.
Specific corporate and personal objectives
are used.
The Committee sought advice from
external consultants, Macdonald Kinnaird,
during the year and also obtained
independent research information. It is
also advised by the Company Secretary. 
The service contracts of executive
Directors are terminable on no more than
one year's notice and do not provide for
pre-determined compensation on
termination, or for loss of office.
Compensation due, if any, is determined
by reference to the applicable notice
period and reason for termination.
The Company believes that there should
be a performance related element to the
remuneration of its employees in order to
encourage and reward out-performance.
The Company therefore operates an
annual bonus scheme for all of its 
regular employees. 
The Celtic plc Executive Share Option
Scheme expired during the year. Existing
option grants are not affected. 
REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS AND SENIOR EXECUTIVES
Payments made to Directors in the
financial year are set out in the table on
page 22 and demonstrate the relative
values of basic salary and performance-
based remuneration. There are several
main elements to the Company's
executive remuneration packages:
Basic salary and benefits
The Committee reviews base salaries for
executive Directors and senior executives
annually, on promotion and exceptionally
during the year if significant additional
responsibilities have been undertaken. 
Benefits for executive Directors include
the provision of a fully expensed company
vehicle or equivalent non-pensionable
vehicle allowance, relocation allowance,
private medical insurance and critical
illness cover. These benefits may be, but
are not automatically, extended to senior
executives. Those receiving such benefits
are assessed for income tax on them. 
ANNUAL PERFORMANCE RELATED 
BONUS SCHEME
The Group continues to operate a
bonus scheme for executive
Directors and all full and part-time
employees on regular contracts,
with the following key objectives:
(A) Improving and sustaining the
financial performance of the Group
from year to year;
(B) Delivering and enhancing
shareholder value; 
(C) Enhancing the reputation and
standing of Celtic;
(D) Delivering consistently high
standards of service to Celtic and its
customers; and 
(E) Attracting, retaining and
motivating talented individuals
whose skills and services will enable
Celtic to meet its strategic
objectives. 20
The Company allows all regular
employees a discount on Company
merchandise and products.
Performance conditions reflect
corporate financial performance and
satisfaction of personal objectives.
Corporate financial performance
incorporates both performance
against budget and the previous
year's results. Maximum award levels
depend upon seniority and
contractual entitlements. The awards
range from a maximum of 20% salary
to a maximum of 60% salary. The
Committee reviews the bonus scheme
structure and performance conditions
annually. Bonus payments are not
pensionable.
Football players and the football
management team are subject to a
separate bonus scheme that rewards
on-field success.
Pension
The Company operates a Group
pension plan, with defined
contributions, in which the Financial
Director, several senior executives and
a number of other employees
participate. Pension contributions for
Peter Lawwell are made to an
independent pension provider.
Stakeholder arrangements are available to
qualifying employees. 
The Company does not operate any
defined benefit (final salary) schemes. 
Share options
The Celtic plc Executive Share Option
Scheme (the Scheme ) was first
established in December 1994 and was
last amended in September 2001. It
expired in December 2004, having been in
place for ten years. No further grants of
options can be made under the Scheme.
The only Directors participating in the
Scheme are Peter Lawwell and Eric Riley.
The last grant of options over Ordinary
Shares of 1p under the Scheme was on 27
October 2003 to Peter Lawwell at an
option price of 51p. The options granted
then and in the preceding grant in
September 2001, including those granted
to the Directors, are exercisable in total
only after three years from the date of
grant and provided that over three
consecutive financial years:
  the increase in market value of the
Company's shares would place the
Company in the top one third of
companies within the Leisure,
Entertainment and Hotels sector 
of the FTSE; and
 if the percentage growth in earnings
per share over three consecutive
financial years exceeds percentage
growth in RPI over the same period by
an average of at least 3% per year. 
The performance criteria stated above are
regarded as a challenging and realistic
test of comparative financial
performance, with a view to securing
consistent growth and shareholder return
against the sector. These options, unless
exercised or lapsing earlier, lapse on the
tenth anniversary of the date of the
grant.
The interests of executive Directors
serving during the year under the Scheme
are set out in the table below:

Options over 1,538,461 Convertible
Preferred Ordinary Shares of  1 were
granted to Martin O'Neill in September
2001 at an exercise price of 130p. These
options lapsed without being exercised,
on his departure from the Company
during the year. 
On 24 April 1997, a limited number of
employees were granted options over
Ordinary Shares (then having a nominal
value of  1.00 each, now 1p each) at the
market value on that date of  3.00. During
the year 10,000 of those options lapsed.
At the balance sheet date, options from
that grant over 60,000 Ordinary Shares of
1p remained. These options are
exercisable at any time between 24 April
2002 and 24 April 2007 and are not
subject to performance conditions.
293,478 options over Ordinary Shares
from the grant in September 2001 lapsed
during the year. At 30 June 2005, the total
number of options outstanding over
Ordinary Shares, including those of the
executive Directors and those remaining
from the grant in 1997 was 1,283,704.
The market price of Ordinary Shares on 
30 June 2005 was 61.5p (2004: 59.0p). 
The price range during the year was 
44.0p to 68.0p.
The market price of the Convertible
Preferred Ordinary Shares on 30 June 2005
was 130.0p (2004: 124.0p) and the price
range during the year was 120.0p to130.0p.
Service Agreements
Executive Directors
Peter Lawwell's service contract as Chief
Executive commenced on 25 October
2003. It continues subject to 12 months'
notice by him to the Company or by the
Company to him. Mr Lawwell is, with the
consent of the Company, non-executive
chairman of Electronic Document
Services Limited. He retains the annual
fee of  17,500 payable for that post.
The Financial Director's service
agreement commenced on 19 August
1994 and continues subject to
termination on twelve months' notice
from the Company, or three months'
notice from the Financial Director. He
serves as a non-executive director of the
Scottish Football Association Limited. 
No fee is payable.
Termination by the Company of the
contracts of these Directors on shorter
notice than provided for in the contracts,
other than for misconduct, would be likely
to create a requirement for payment of
compensation related to the unexpired
element of the notice period. 
Non-executive Directors
Individual letters govern the
appointments of the Chairman and the
non-executive Directors. Typically, non-
executive Directors are expected to serve
for at least three years. The appointment
letters of Mr Hagman, Mr McBride and Mr
Wilson all provide for that period. Future
non-executive Director appointments will
also be for a stated duration, in
accordance with best practice.
Remuneration of Directors
Directors' remuneration and benefits are
set out in the table opposite.

Remuneration of non-executive
Directors is for service on the Board
and its Committees and is reviewed
by the Board as a whole each year
against fees in comparable companies
of a similar size and taking account of
overall financial performance of the
Company. No increase in non-
executive Director fees was applied
during the year. There has been no
increase in non-executive Directors'
fees since 1998.
The non-executive Directors have no
personal financial interest other than
as shareholders. They are not
members of the Company's pension
scheme and do not participate in any
bonus scheme, share option or other
profit schemes. All Directors are
entitled to one seat in the Presidential
Box without charge for each home
match, to assist them in performing 
their duties.
The Company Chairman is entitled to 
take up to 50% of his fees in Ordinary
Shares of the Company and has the 
use of a Company car and driver on
Company business. 
Shareholder Return
The graph below compares the total
shareholder return on an investment of
 100 in the Ordinary Shares of Celtic plc
over a five year period commencing on 1
July 2000 with the total shareholder
return over the same period on a notional
investment of  100 made up of shares of
the same kinds and number as those by
PERFORMANCE GRAPH
reference to which the FTSE Leisure and
Hotels index is calculated. In the opinion
of the Directors, the FTSE Leisure and
Hotels index, of which the Company is a
constituent, is currently the most
appropriate index against which the total
shareholder return of the Company should
be measured, as it is most likely to be
used by investors, shareholders and
management as a measure of
performance in the leisure and hotel
sector. This index includes other listed
football clubs and is currently utilised as
the benchmark against which
performance under the Company's
Executive Share Option Scheme is
assessed. Total shareholder return
represents the change in value of a
holding of shares over the relevant 
period assuming immediate reinvestment
of dividends. 
The Chairman of the Committee will be
available to answer questions concerning
Directors' remuneration at the Company's
Annual General Meeting.
