This Report has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable law. It has been approved and adopted by the 
Remuneration Committee and the Board. 
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee )
The Committee has formal terms of reference which are 
published on the Company's website. The Committee 
members serving during the year are identified on  
pages 14 and 19.
Remuneration Policy
Although not obliged to apply the Combined Code, the 
Company has again elected to report against the Code for 
the year ended 30 June 2007. The Company has complied 
with the Code during that period in connection with 
executive remuneration in force during that time. 
The main objective of the policy remains to attract, retain 
and motivate experienced and capable individuals who will 
make a significant contribution to the Company's success 
but without paying more than is reasonable or necessary. 
Account is taken of remuneration packages within other 
comparable companies and sectors, the Company's 
performance against budget in the year and against actual 
performance from year to year. Specific corporate and 
personal objectives are used for executive Directors and 
certain senior executives. A similar appraisal system is also 
applied to regular employees throughout the Company.
The Committee obtains advice from the Company 
Secretary and from independent research. External 
consultants, Macdonald Kinnaird, were also used during  
the year. 
The service contracts of executive Directors can be 
terminated on no more than one year's notice and 
do not provide for pre-determined compensation on 
termination, or for loss of office. Compensation due, if any, 
is determined by reference to the applicable notice period 
and reason for termination.
The Company operates an annual bonus scheme for 
all of its regular employees in order to encourage out-
performance and motivate and retain staff.
The Celtic plc Executive Share Option Scheme expired 
in December 2004. Options granted prior to then are 
not affected, although have been adjusted as a result 
of the share issue in December 2005. Further details on 
outstanding share options are given below.
The Company proposes, subject to shareholder approval, 
to introduce a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP ) as 
a replacement for the share option scheme. Further 
information is given below.
Remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior 
Executives
Payments made to Directors in the financial year are set 
out in the table on page 24. 
There are several main elements to the Company's 
executive remuneration packages:
Basic salary and benefits
The Committee reviews basic salaries for executive 
Directors and senior executives annually.
Benefits for executive Directors include a fully expensed 
car or equivalent non-pensionable car allowance, relocation 
allowance, private medical insurance and critical illness 
cover. These benefits may be, but are not automatically, 
extended to senior executives. Those receiving such 
benefits are assessed for income tax on them. 
The Company allows all regular employees a discount on 
Company merchandise and products.
Annual Performance Related Bonus Scheme
The Group operates a bonus scheme for executive 
Directors and all full and part-time employees on regular 
contracts, with the following key objectives:
  Improving and sustaining the financial performance of 
the Group from year to year;
  Delivering and enhancing shareholder value; 
  Enhancing the reputation and standing of Celtic;
  Delivering consistently high standards of service to 
Celtic and its customers; and 
  Attracting, retaining and motivating talented 
individuals whose skills and services will enable Celtic to 
meet its strategic objectives.
Performance conditions cover corporate financial 
performance and personal objectives. Corporate financial 
performance includes performance against budget and 
against the previous year's results. Maximum award levels 
depend upon seniority and contractual entitlements, 
ranging from 20% of basic salary to 60% of basic salary. 
The Committee reviews the bonus scheme structure and 
performance conditions each year. Bonus payments are not 
pensionable.
Football players and the football management team are 
subject to a separate bonus scheme that rewards on-field 
success.
Pension
The Company operates a Group pension plan, with defined 
contributions, in which the Financial Director, several 
senior executives and a number of other employees 
participate. Pension contributions for Peter Lawwell are 
made to an independent pension provider. Stakeholder 
arrangements are available to qualifying employees. The 
Company does not operate any defined benefit (final salary) 
schemes. 
Share options
The Celtic plc Executive Share Option Scheme (the 
Scheme ) expired in December 2004, having been in place 
for ten years. No further grants of options can be made 
under it.
Options granted, unless exercised or lapsing earlier, lapse 
on the tenth anniversary of the date of the grant.
The only Directors participating in the Scheme are Peter 
Lawwell and Eric Riley.
remuneration report 22
Performance Conditions 
All outstanding options are exercisable in total only after 
three years from the date of grant and provided that over 
three consecutive financial years:
  the increase in market value of the Company's shares 
would place the Company in the top one third of 
companies within the Leisure, Entertainment and 
Hotels sector of the FTSE; and
 
  if the percentage growth in earnings per share over 
three consecutive financial years exceeds percentage 
growth in RPI over the same period by an average of at 
least 3% per year. 
 
The performance criteria stated above were regarded as 
a challenging test of comparative financial performance, 
with a view to securing consistent growth and shareholder 
return against the sector.
Option Grants
1997 Grant
On 24 April 1997, a number of employees were granted 
options over Ordinary Shares (then having a nominal 
value of  1.00 each, now 1p each) at the market value on 
that date of  3.00. At the beginning of the year, options 
from that grant over 60,000 Ordinary Shares of 1p were in 
place. These options were exercisable at any time between 
24 April 2002 and 24 April 2007 and were not subject to 
performance conditions. Those options have since expired, 
with none having been exercised.
2001 Grant
Options were granted over Ordinary Shares of 1p each on 
15 September 2001 at a price of 107.5p. No options over 
Ordinary Shares from the grant in September 2001 lapsed 
during the year. The total number outstanding at 1 July 
2006 was 635,470. 
 
2003 Grant
Options over 588,234 Ordinary Shares of 1p under the 
Scheme were granted on 27 October 2003 to Peter 
Lawwell, at an option price of 51p. None of these options 
lapsed during the year.
At the beginning of the financial year (1 July 2006), the 
total number of options outstanding over Ordinary Shares, 
including those of the executive Directors and those 
remaining from the grant in 1997 was 1,283,704.
Option adjustment
In December 2005 50,000,000 new Ordinary Shares of 1p 
each were allotted and issued to shareholders under an 
Open Offer and Offer for Subscription. Under the terms of 
the Scheme, in such circumstances the number of shares 
over which options subsist and the acquisition price, are 
to be adjusted in such manner as the Company's auditors 
consider is fair and reasonable. The consent of H M 
Revenue and Customs to any adjustment is also required. 
During the financial year ending 30 June 2007, H M 
Revenue and Customs consented to a reduction in 
exercise price of 18.6% to reflect the dilutive impact of 
the December 2005 share issue, and required also that 
the number of options granted be increased by such 
amount as was necessary to maintain the original value of 
the option grants. The Company's auditors, PKF (UK) LLP, 
concurred with this position.
Accordingly, adjustments were made to all options 
outstanding at that time. At 30 June 2007, options were 
outstanding over 1,504,497 Ordinary Shares of 1p each, the 
options granted in April 1997 having lapsed. A summary of 
the outcome of the adjustments made is shown below.

The closing market price of Ordinary Shares on 29 June 
2007 (the last business day of the financial year) was 60.0 p 
(2006: 27.0p). The closing price range during the year was 
22.50p to 62.75 p.
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP )
The Board considers that it is appropriate to introduce 
a new long term incentive plan as a replacement for the 
share option scheme which expired in December 2004. The 
main objective of an LTIP is to retain and reward, through 
financial incentives, key executives within the Company 
over the medium to long term. This proposal is subject 
to approval of shareholders at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting.
Under the terms of the proposed LTIP, in return for these 
individuals remaining with the Company for a minimum of 
4 years and during that period also meeting performance 
criteria imposed by the Board, annual awards would be 
made, which would then accrue and be released at the end 
of the 4 year period. 
The LTIP, if approved, would apply to financial years 
2007/2008 onwards. The performance conditions to be 
applied will be those personal performance conditions 
applied as part of the annual bonus scheme together with 
such further conditions as the Board, acting through the 
Remuneration Committee consider appropriate. Those 
conditions are required to be challenging but achievable. 
Performance conditions under the annual scheme have 
both personal and corporate performance elements. 
These parameters have been selected because the Board 
believes that the objectives of the annual scheme for 
senior executives are also substantially based on the 
medium to longer term strategic objectives of the 
Company, taking account of the rolling 5 year business 
plan and the nature of the Company's business. Projects, 
such as the Lennoxtown training facility, may take a 
number of years to complete, with various milestones 
through that period, or have a longer term impact.
The executive Directors, Peter Lawwell and Eric Riley, 
are both participants in the proposed LTIP. Satisfaction 
of performance conditions would be determined by the 
Remuneration Committee at the end of the financial year. 
Further details of the proposed LTIP are included in the 
Explanatory Notes accompanying the Notice of the Annual 
General Meeting.
Service Agreements
Executive Directors
Chief Executive 
Peter Lawwell's service contract commenced on 25 
October 2003. It continues subject to 12 months' notice 
by him to the Company or by the Company to him. 
Mr Lawwell is, with the consent of the Company, non-
executive Chairman of Intelligent Office Limited (formerly 
Electronic Document Services Limited). He retains the 
annual fee of  17,500 payable for that post. Mr Lawwell 
is entitled to a maximum payment under the Company's 
bonus scheme of 60% of basic salary, if all performance 
conditions are satisfied.
Financial Director 
Eric Riley's service contract commenced on 19 August 
1994 and continues subject to termination on twelve 
months' notice from the Company, or three months' notice 
from Mr Riley. Mr Riley is entitled to a maximum payment 
under the Company's bonus scheme of 50% of basic 
salary, if all performance conditions are satisfied. Mr Riley 
served as a non-executive director of the Scottish Football 
Association Limited during the year and of The Scottish 
Premier League Limited. No fee was payable for either post. 
Mr Riley has been reappointed to the Board of the Scottish 
Premier League Limited. 
Termination by the Company of the contracts of these 
Directors on shorter notice than provided for in the 
contracts, other than for misconduct, would be likely to 
create a requirement for payment of compensation related 
to the unexpired element of the notice period. 
Non-executive Directors
Individual letters govern the appointments of the 
Chairman and the non-executive Directors. Typically, 
non-executive Directors are appointed for an initial 
period of three years and expected to serve for at least 
two three year terms but appointments may be extended 
beyond that at the discretion of the Board, and subject 
to re-election by shareholders in accordance with the 
Articles of Association. These appointments are terminable 
immediately on written notice, without requirement for 
payment of compensation.
Brian Quinn has been a director of the Company since 
1 March 1996. In accordance with the Combined Code, 
having served more than 9 years, he retires from office 
annually. Dermot Desmond has been a director since 12 
May 1995 and also retires from office annually. Tom Allison 
was appointed on 15 September 2001 and is completing 
the last year of his second three year term of office. Brian 
McBride was appointed on 5 January 2005 with four 
months of the initial term of 3 years remaining. Brian 
Wilson joined the Board on 1 June 2005, with eight months 
of the initial period of three years remaining. Each of Tom 
Allison, Brian McBride and Brian Wilson will continue in 
office, at the invitation of the Board, for a further three 
years after expiry of the current periods.
Remuneration of Directors
Directors' remuneration and benefits for the year to 30 
June 2007 are set out in the table opposite. 
Remuneration of non-executive Directors is for service 
on the Board and its Committees and is reviewed by the 
Board as a whole each year against fees in comparable 
companies of a similar size and taking account of overall 
financial performance of the Company. No increase in 
non-executive fees was applied for the year ending 30 June 
2006. 
There has been no increase in non-executive Directors' 
fees since 1998, as result of which non-executive fees have 
been eroded by inflation and have also fallen significantly 
behind applicable market rates. Following a detailed 
review, which took account of independent external survey 
data and the advice of independent external consultants, 
an increase in non-executive fees to  25,000 per year, 
and in the Chairman's fee, to  50,000 per year has been 
applied with effect from 1 July 2007. The decision on 
non-executive fees was taken by the Chairman and the 
executive Directors. The Chairman did not participate in 
the decision-making process in connection with his own 
fee.
The Board also decided that the post of Chairman of the 
Audit Committee should attract an additional fee of  5,000 
per year, reflecting the significant additional responsibility 
and workload attached to that post. 
The non-executive Directors have no personal financial 
interest other than as shareholders. They are not members 
of the Company's pension scheme and do not participate 
in any bonus scheme, share option or other profit schemes. 
All Directors are entitled to one seat in the Presidential Box 
without charge for each home match, to assist them in 
performing their duties. 24

The Company Chairman is entitled to take up to 50% of his

not done so. The Chairman also has the use of a Company 
car and driver on Company business. 
Shareholder Return
The graph below compares the total shareholder return 
on an investment of  100 in the Ordinary Shares of Celtic 
plc over a five year period commencing on 1 July 2002 
with the total shareholder return over the same period on 
a notional investment of  100 made up of shares of the 
same kinds and number as those by reference to which the 
FTSE Leisure and Hotels index is calculated. 
In the opinion of the Directors, the FTSE Leisure and 
Hotels index, of which the Company was a constituent, 
is currently the most appropriate index against which 
the total shareholder return of the Company should be 
measured, as it is most likely to be used by investors, 
shareholders and management as a measure of 
performance in the leisure and hotel sector. This index 
includes other listed football clubs and is utilised as 
the benchmark against which performance under the 
Company's Executive Share Option Scheme is assessed. 
Total shareholder return represents the change in value 
of a holding of shares over the relevant period assuming 
immediate reinvestment of dividends. 
The Chairman of the Committee will be available to answer 
questions concerning Directors' remuneration at the 
Company's Annual General Meeting.
