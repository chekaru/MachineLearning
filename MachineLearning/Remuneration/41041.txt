Internal Financial Control
The Board has ultimate responsibility for ensuring that a 
balanced and understandable assessment of the Group's 
financial position and prospects is presented. The Annual 
Report and Financial Statements are an essential part 
of this presentation. The Directors are committed to 
achieving high levels of disclosure within the confines 
of preserving the Group's competitive position and 
maintaining commercial confidentiality.
The internal financial control procedures are designed  
to give reasonable but not absolute assurance that the 
assets of the Company and the Group are safeguarded 
against material misstatement or loss and that proper 
accounting records are maintained. The Group employs 
an internal auditor who attends and reports at each Audit 
Committee meeting.
The key features of the control environment are as 
follows:
The work undertaken of the Internal Audit function is 
consistent with previous years and covers the key risk and 
systems of control within the business. 
In addition to an ongoing assessment of the effectiveness 
of the Company's system of internal financial controls, 
a framework is in place to plan, monitor and control the 
Group's activities including an annual budget and a rolling 
5 year planning process. 
An annual review process is in place to consider the 
financial implications of significant business risks upon 
the business. Regular meetings of the Business Continuity 
Team take place throughout the year. 
A comprehensive internal forecasting process is in place 
and updated on a regular basis. Monthly management 
accounts are produced and significant variances from 
budget and forecast are investigated. 
In addition to the core areas Internal Audit has made 
recommendations in respect of the development of the 
Company's IT infrastructure. During the year an electronic 
Purchase Order system was introduced, a computerised 
Fixed Asset Register is in progress and improvements have 
been made to the control framework surrounding the IT 
department.
The effectiveness of the system of internal financial 
control takes account of any material developments that 
have taken place in the Group and in applicable rules and 
legislation. The review is currently performed on the basis 
of the criteria in the Turnbull Guidance. 
BY ORDER OF THE BOARD
Robert Howat
Company Secretary
Nomination Committee
This Committee comprises Dr John Reid as Chairman, 
Dermot Desmond and Tom Allison. It meets as necessary, 
principally to consider and recommend new appointments 
to the Board and senior positions in the Company for 
succession purposes. The Committee met twice during 
the financial year. 
Executive search consultants and open advertising were 
not used by the Committee when considering succession 
planning issues associated with the retirement of the 
Chairman. An interest in football and support for the Club 
itself are important (although not conclusive factors), 
combined with expertise in fields which complement the 
existing skills and experience of the Board members and 
the nature and profile of the Company's business. In what 
is already a relatively small sector, the required attributes 
result in a limited field of potential candidates in any 
event and accordingly the Board have not considered it 
necessary to engage the services and meet the cost of 
external agencies.
INVESTOR COMMUNICATION
Matchday events and investor dinners are used as 
informal, but effective methods of communicating with 
major shareholders. A number of the Company's major 
shareholders attend matches regularly and have the 
opportunity to meet the Board and any new Director. The 
Annual General Meeting in particular is used to encourage 
participation of shareholders. At each of these events 
shareholders are invited to ask questions and to meet with 
the Directors informally. 
Regular consultation meetings also take place with 
supporters' associations, supporter clubs, shareholder 
groups and customer groups on general issues, as well as 
on specific proposals. The Company's website is used to 
provide information on an ongoing basis and the Group 
Financial Statements and other information are published 
there shortly after release. 
REPORTING AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
The Board's Review of Internal Control
Risk management, compliance and internal control 
programmes are approved, monitored and reviewed by  
the Audit Committee throughout the year on behalf of 
the Board. The results of these programmes are reported 
to the Audit Committee in detail at its meetings and  
then communicated to the Board at the next following 
Board meeting. 
The Board is satisfied that there is an ongoing and 
effective process for identifying, assessing and managing 
all significant risks facing the Group.
Corporate Governance

Benefits for executive Directors include a fully  
expensed car or equivalent non-pensionable car  
allowance, private medical insurance, pension 
contributions and critical illness cover. These benefits 
may be, but are not automatically, extended to senior 
executives. Those receiving such benefits are assessed  
for income tax on them. 
The Company allows all regular employees a discount on 
Company merchandise and products.
Annual Performance Related Bonus Scheme
The Group operates a bonus scheme for executive 
Directors and most full and part-time employees on 
regular contracts, with the following key objectives:
1   Improving and sustaining the financial performance of 
the Group from year to year;
2  Delivering and enhancing shareholder value; 
3  Enhancing the reputation and standing of Celtic;
4   Delivering consistently high standards of service to 
Celtic and its customers; and 
5   Attracting, retaining and motivating talented 
individuals whose skills and services will enable Celtic 
to meet its strategic objectives.
Performance conditions cover corporate financial 
performance and personal objectives. Corporate financial 
performance includes performance against budget and 
against the previous year's results. Maximum award levels 
depend upon seniority and contractual entitlements, 
ranging from 20% of basic salary to 60% of basic salary. 
The Committee reviews the bonus scheme structure and 
the corporate performance conditions each year. Bonus 
payments are not pensionable.
Football players, the football management team and 
football backroom staff are subject to separate bonus 
schemes that reward on-field success.
Pension
The Company operates a Group pension plan, with defined 
contributions, in which the Financial Director, several 
senior executives and a number of other employees 
participate. Pension contributions for the Chief Executive 
are made to an independent pension provider. Stakeholder 
arrangements are available to qualifying employees. The 
Company does not operate any defined benefit (final 
salary) schemes. 
Share options
The Celtic plc Executive Share Option Scheme (the 
Scheme ) expired in December 2004, having been in place 
for ten years. No further grants of options can be made 
under it. Options already granted, unless exercised or 
lapsing earlier, lapse on the tenth anniversary of the date 
of the grant.
The only Directors participating in the Scheme are Peter 
Lawwell and Eric Riley.
This Report has been approved and adopted by the 
Remuneration Committee and the Board. 
The Remuneration Committee 
The Committee has formal terms of reference which are 
published on the Company's website. The Committee 
members serving during the year are identified on page 24.
As part of its continuing commitment to provide 
meaningful information to shareholders, this report 
continues to contain data that the Board and 
Remuneration Committee have elected to disclose, even 
although the Company is not obliged by law or the AIM 
Rules to make that information available. 
Remuneration Policy
The Company has complied with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code during the year in connection with 
executive remuneration in force during that time. 
The main objective of the policy remains to attract, 
retain and motivate experienced and capable individuals 
who will make a significant contribution to the Group's 
success but, taking account of the marketplace, without 
paying more than is reasonable or necessary. Account is 
taken of remuneration packages within other comparable 
companies and sectors, particularly other large football 
clubs, the Group's performance against budget in the year 
and against actual performance from year to year. Specific 
corporate and personal objectives are used for executive 
Directors and certain senior executives. A similar appraisal 
system is also applied to most regular employees 
throughout the Group.
The Committee obtains advice from the Company 
Secretary, from independent research report and from the 
published accounts of a number of other companies. No 
external consultants were used during the year. 
The service contracts of executive Directors can be 
terminated on no more than one year's notice and 
do not provide for pre-determined compensation on 
termination, or for loss of office. Compensation due, if any, 
is determined by reference to the applicable notice period 
and reason for termination.
The Group operates an annual bonus scheme for most 
of its regular employees in order to encourage out-
performance, motivate, and retain staff. The scheme is 
reviewed each year by the Committee, monitored to 
ensure fairness and consistency in application. Changes 
are made when considered appropriate, or to reflect 
changes in the Group's performance or business plan.
Remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Executives
Payments made to Directors in the financial year are set 
out on page 27.
There are several main elements to the Company's 
executive remuneration packages:
Basic salary and benefits
The Committee reviews basic salaries for executive 
Directors and certain senior executives annually. The salaries 
of senior members of the football management team and 
senior players are considered directly by the Board.

E Riley 508,045 87.4p - - 508,045 Ordinary 1p Sept 2004/11
Performance Conditions 
All outstanding options are exercisable in total only after 
three years from the date of grant and provided that over 
three consecutive financial years:
1   the increase in market value of the Company's shares 
would place the Company in the top one third of 
companies within the Leisure, Entertainment and 
Hotels sector of the FTSE; and
2   if the percentage growth in earnings per share over 
three consecutive financial years exceeds percentage 
growth in RPI over the same period by an average of at 
least 3% per year. 
The performance criteria stated above were regarded at 
the time of grant as a challenging test of comparative 
financial performance, with a view to securing consistent 
growth and shareholder return against the sector.
Outstanding Option Grants
2001 Grant
Options were granted over Ordinary Shares of 1p each on 
15 September 2001 at a price of 107.5p. The number and 
exercise price of these options were adjusted to 87.4p, 
with the consent of H M Revenue & Customs and following 
advice from the Company's auditors, in the financial 
year to 30 June 2007 to reflect the dilutive impact of the 
share issue that took place in December 2005. No options 
over Ordinary Shares from the grant in September 2001, 
as adjusted, lapsed during the year. The total number 
outstanding at 30 June 2011 was 752,901 (2010: 752,901). 
These will all lapse, if not exercised, on 15 September 2011.
2003 Grant
Options over Ordinary Shares of 1p were granted under 
the Scheme on 27 October 2003 to Peter Lawwell, at 
an option price of 51p. These were also adjusted in the 
year to 30 June 2007 to reflect the dilutive impact of the 
December 2005 share issue. No options from this grant 
lapsed during the year. The total number outstanding at 
30 June 2011 was 722,889 (2010: 722,889).
Details of the options held by executive Directors are 
given below. 
The closing market price of Ordinary Shares on 30 June 2010 was 45.0p (2008: 40.5p). The closing price range during the year was 39.5 p to 47.0p.
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP )
An LTIP was introduced in 2007 as a replacement for the 
share option scheme which expired in December 2004. 
The LTIP was approved by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting in November 2007. The main objective 
of the LTIP is to retain and reward, through financial 
incentives, key executives within the Company over the 
medium to long term. 
Under the terms of the LTIP, in return for these individuals 
remaining with the Company for a minimum of 4 years 
and during that period also meeting performance criteria 
imposed by the Board, annual awards are made, which 
then accrue and are released at the end of the 4 year 
period, assuming the LTIP conditions have been met. 
The LTIP applies to the financial years from 2007/2008 
onwards, the financial year 2010/2011 being the fourth and 
last year of its initial operation. The performance conditions 
applied are those personal performance conditions applied 
as part of the annual bonus scheme together with such 
further conditions as the Board, acting through the 
Remuneration Committee, consider appropriate. Those 
conditions are required to be challenging but achievable. 
Performance conditions under the annual scheme have 
both personal and corporate performance elements. 
These parameters have been selected because the Board 
believes that the objectives of the annual scheme for senior 
executives are also substantially based on the medium to 
longer-term strategic objectives of the Company, taking 
account of the rolling 5-year business plan and the nature 
of the Company's business. Some projects may take a 
number of years to complete, with various milestones 
through that period, or have a longer term impact.
Peter Lawwell and Eric Riley participate in the LTIP. The 
Remuneration Committee was satisfied that each of these 
individuals had satisfied the applicable criteria for the 
financial year to 30 June 2011. Accordingly, the awards set 
out in the table below have been made conditionally for 
the benefit of Mr. Lawwell and Mr. Riley, respectively for the 
2010/11 financial year. Subject to Mr Lawwell and Mr Riley 
being employed at the time, payment of their accumulated 
LTIP interest will be released at the end of August 2011.

Following on from the end of the remuneration package 
approved in 2008/2009 Mr Lawwell's maximum annual 
bonus entitlement reverts to 60% of salary (uncapped). 
Financial Director 
Eric Riley's service contract commenced on 19 August 
1994 and continues subject to termination on twelve 
months' notice from the Company, or three months' 
notice from Mr Riley. Mr Riley is entitled to a maximum 
payment under the Company's bonus scheme of 50% of 
basic salary, if all performance conditions are satisfied. 
Mr Riley served on the Council of the Scottish Football 
Association during the year and as a director of the 
Scottish Premier League Limited. No fee is payable for 
either post. 
Termination by the Company of the contracts of these 
Directors on shorter notice than provided for in the 
contracts, other than for misconduct or material breach, 
would be likely to create a requirement for payment of 
compensation related to the unexpired element of the 
notice periods and additionally in Mr Lawwell's case, a 
prorated amount of the loyalty bonus.
Non-executive Directors
Individual letters govern the appointments of the 
Chairman and the non-executive Directors. Typically, 
non-executive Directors are appointed for an initial period 
of three years and are expected to serve for at least two 
three-year terms but appointments may be extended 
beyond that at the discretion of the Board, and subject to 
re-election by shareholders in accordance with the Articles 
of Association. These appointments are terminable 
immediately on written notice, without requirement for 
payment of compensation.
Service Agreements
Executive Directors
Chief Executive 
Peter Lawwell's service contract commenced on 25 
October 2003. It continues subject to 12 months' notice 
by him to the Company or by the Company to him. In 
September 2008 amendments were made to Mr Lawwell's 
remuneration package in order to retain his services and 
reflect remuneration being paid elsewhere within the 
football sector. Potential entitlements under the LTIP 
were taken into account. As a result of these changes 
Mr Lawwell's basic salary was increased, and was fixed 
for 2008/2009 and the 2 following financial years at that 
increased level.
For the financial year to 30 June 2011, Mr Lawwell continued 
to be entitled to a maximum payment under the Company's 
bonus scheme of 60% of basic salary, if all performance 
conditions were satisfied, but this is subject to an overall 
maximum of  200,000, notwithstanding the increase in his 
basic salary that took place in 2008. Mr Lawwell's maximum 
participation in the LTIP is subject to the conditions of that 
scheme. Subject to the outcome of the LTIP, an additional 
loyalty award of  150,000 was payable to Mr Lawwell if he 
remained employed by the Company throughout the period 
from 15 September 2008 to 30 June 2011. The amount (if 
any) of the loyalty award was dependent upon the outcome 
of the LTIP but the aggregate of payments due under the 
loyalty award and LTIP could not exceed  650,000. As Mr 
Lawwell's total LTIP entitlement, subject to satisfaction of 
the scheme terms and conditions, is  650,000, no additional 
loyalty award is payable. 
Mr Lawwell deferred payment of an element ( 152,288) 
of his bonus for financial year 2009/10 for an unspecified 
period. He has deferred payment of his entire bonus award 
for 2010/11 ( 200,000) on a similar basis. Both deferred 
amounts remain payable at Mr Lawwell's instance.

*Although entitled to a bonus of  190,359 for the financial year to 30 June 2010 under the terms of the Company's bonus scheme, Mr Lawwell 
unilaterally waived  38,071 of that entitlement. Mr Lawwell voluntarily deferred payment of the remaining amount of  152,288 until a future, as yet 
unspecified, date. Mr Lawwell has also deferred payment of his entire bonus entitlement ( 200,000) awarded for financial year 2010/11 until a future,  
as yet unspecified, date.
