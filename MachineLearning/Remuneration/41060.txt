Remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Executives
Payments made to Directors in the financial year are set 
out on page 25.
There are several main elements to the Company's 
executive remuneration packages:
Basic salary and benefits
The Committee reviews basic salaries for executive 
Directors and certain senior executives annually. The salaries 
of senior members of the football management team and 
senior players are considered directly by the Board.
Benefits for executive Directors include a fully expensed 
car or equivalent non-pensionable car allowance, private 
medical insurance, pension contributions and critical illness 
cover. These benefits may be, but are not automatically, 
extended to senior executives. Those receiving such 
benefits are assessed for income tax on them. 
The Company allows all regular employees a discount on 
Company merchandise and products.
Annual Performance Related Bonus Scheme
The Group operates a bonus scheme for executive 
Directors and most full and part-time employees on 
regular contracts, with the following key objectives:
1   Improving and sustaining the financial performance  
of the Group from year to year;
2  Delivering and enhancing shareholder value; 
3  Enhancing the reputation and standing of Celtic;
4   Delivering consistently high standards of service to 
Celtic and its customers; and 
5   Attracting, retaining and motivating talented 
individuals whose skills and services will enable Celtic 
to meet its strategic objectives.
Performance conditions cover corporate financial 
performance and personal objectives. Corporate financial 
performance includes performance against budget and 
against the previous year's results. Maximum award levels 
depend upon seniority and contractual entitlements, 
ranging from 20% of basic salary to 60% of basic salary. 
The Committee reviews the bonus scheme structure and 
the corporate performance conditions each year. Bonus 
payments are not pensionable.
Football players, the football management team and 
football backroom staff are subject to separate bonus 
schemes that reward on-field success.
Pension
The Company operates a Group pension plan, with 
defined contributions, in which several senior executives 
and a number of other employees participate. Pension 
contributions for the Financial Director and Chief 
Executive are made to independent pension providers. 
Stakeholder arrangements are available to qualifying 
employees. The Company does not operate any defined 
benefit (final salary) schemes. 
This Report has been approved and adopted by the 
Remuneration Committee and the Board. 
The Remuneration Committee 
The Committee has formal terms of reference which  
are published on the Company's website. The Committee 
members serving during the year are identified on  
page 21.
As part of its continuing commitment to provide 
meaningful information to shareholders, this report 
continues to contain data that the Board and 
Remuneration Committee have elected to disclose, even 
although the Company is not obliged by law or the AIM 
Rules to make all of that information available. 
Remuneration Policy
The Company has complied with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code during the year in connection with 
executive remuneration in force during that time. 
The main objective of the Company's remuneration policy 
remains to attract, retain and motivate experienced 
and capable individuals who will make a significant 
contribution to the Group's success but, taking account of 
the marketplace, without paying more than is reasonable 
or necessary. Account is taken of remuneration packages 
within other comparable companies and sectors, 
particularly other large football clubs, the Group's 
performance against budget in the year and against actual 
performance from year to year. Specific corporate and 
personal objectives are used for executive Directors and 
certain senior executives. A similar appraisal system is also 
applied to most regular employees throughout the Group.
The Committee obtains advice from the Company 
Secretary, from independent research reports and from 
the published accounts of a number of other companies. 
No external consultants were used during the financial 
year on remuneration matters. 
The service contracts of executive Directors can be 
terminated on no more than one year's notice and 
do not provide for pre-determined compensation on 
termination, or for loss of office. Compensation due, if any, 
is determined by reference to the applicable notice period 
and reason for termination.
The Group operates an annual bonus scheme for most 
of its regular employees in order to encourage out-
performance, motivate, and retain staff. The scheme is 
reviewed each year by the Committee, and monitored to 
ensure fairness and consistency in application. Changes 
are made when considered appropriate, or to reflect 
changes in the Group's performance or business plan.

Report 24
Share options
The Celtic plc Executive Share Option Scheme (the 
Scheme ) expired in December 2004, having been in place 
for ten years. No further grants of options can be made 
under it. Options already granted, unless exercised or 
lapsing earlier, lapse on the tenth anniversary of the date 
of the grant.
The only Directors participating in the Scheme are Peter 
Lawwell and Eric Riley.
Performance Conditions 
All outstanding options are exercisable in total only after 
three years from the date of grant and provided that over 
three consecutive financial years:
1   the increase in market value of the Company's shares 
would place the Company in the top one third of 
companies within the Leisure, Entertainment and 
Hotels sector of the FTSE; and
2   if the percentage growth in earnings per share over 
three consecutive financial years exceeds percentage 
growth in RPI over the same period by an average of at 
least 3% per year. 
The performance criteria stated above were regarded at 
the time of grant as a challenging test of comparative 
financial performance, with a view to securing consistent 
growth and shareholder return against the sector.
Option Grants
2001 Grant
Options were granted over Ordinary Shares of 1p each 
on 15 September 2001. The total number outstanding at 
30 June 2011 was 752,901. None of these options were 
exercised during the year and all those remaining lapsed 
on 15 September 2011.
2003 Grant
Options over Ordinary Shares of 1p were granted under 
the Scheme on 27 October 2003 to Peter Lawwell, at 
an option price of 51p. These were also adjusted in the 
year to 30 June 2007 to reflect the dilutive impact of the 
December 2005 share issue. No options from this grant 
lapsed during the year. The total number outstanding at 
30 June 2012 was 722,889 (2011: 722,889).
Details of the options held by executive Directors are 
summarised below. 
The closing market price of Ordinary Shares on 30 June 
2012 was 34.50p (2011: 39.50p). The closing price range 
during the year was 29.0p to 41.50p.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Company's Long Term Incentive Plan concluded at the 
end of financial year 2010/11. Peter Lawwell and Eric Riley 
were participants. Amounts due to these individuals under 
the Plan were provided for in financial year 2010/2011 and 
were disclosed in the 2010/11 Annual Report. 
The sums due were released in August 2011, as follows:
P Lawwell   650,000 
E Riley    250,000 
All payments were subject to normal statutory deductions.
Service Agreements
Executive Directors
Chief Executive 
Peter Lawwell's service contract commenced on  
25 October 2003. It continues subject to 12 months' 
notice by him to the Company or by the Company to 
him. For the financial year to 30 June 2012, Mr Lawwell 
continued to be entitled to a maximum payment under 
the Company's bonus scheme of 60% of basic salary, if  
all performance conditions were satisfied. 
The Remuneration Committee decided to make an 
additional bonus award to Mr Lawwell, on an ex gratia 
basis, for the financial year having taken account of the 
scale of incremental value delivered for the benefit of  
the Company through his fulfilment of the objectives  
set for him.
Mr Lawwell deferred payment of an element  
( 152,288) of his bonus for financial year 2009/10  
for an unspecified period. He deferred payment of his 
entire bonus award for 2010 /11 ( 200,000) on a similar 
basis. Both deferred amounts remain payable at Mr 
Lawwell's instance. 
Financial Director 
Eric Riley's service contract commenced on 19 August 
1994 and continues subject to termination on twelve 
months' notice from the Company, or three months' 
notice from Mr Riley. Mr Riley is entitled to a maximum 
payment under the Company's bonus scheme of 50% of 
basic salary, if all performance conditions are satisfied. 
Mr Riley served on the Council of the Scottish Football 
Association during the year and as a director of the 
Scottish Premier League Limited. No fee is payable for 
either post.

Non-executive Directors' fees have remained static  
since July 2007. No increase is being applied for 2012/2013. 
The post of Chairman of the Audit Committee carries  
an additional fee of  5,000 per year, reflecting the 
significant additional responsibility and workload attached 
to that post. 
The non-executive Directors have no personal financial 
interest other than as shareholders. They are not 
members of the Company's pension scheme and do not 
participate in any bonus scheme, share option or other 
profit schemes. All Directors are entitled to one seat in the 
Presidential Box without charge for each home match, to 
assist them in performing their duties.
The Chairman of the Committee will be available to 
answer questions concerning Directors' remuneration at 
the Company's Annual General Meeting.
BY ORDER OF THE BOARD
Robert Howat, Secretary
18 September 2012
Celtic Park, Glasgow G40 3RE
Termination by the Company of the contracts of these 
Directors on shorter notice than provided for in the 
contracts, other than for misconduct or material breach, 
would be likely to create a requirement for payment of 
compensation related to the unexpired element of the 
notice periods.
Non-executive Directors
Individual letters govern the appointments of the 
Chairman and the non-executive Directors. Typically,  
non-executive Directors are appointed for an initial  
period of three years and are expected to serve for at  
least two three-year terms but appointments may be 
extended beyond that at the discretion of the Board,  
and subject to re-appointment by shareholders in 
accordance with the Articles of Association. These 
appointments are terminable immediately on 
written notice, without requirement for payment of 
compensation.
Unexpired periods of service for non-executive Directors 
as at 30 June 2012:
Ian Bankier  First term  2 years remaining
Brian Duffy First term  7 months remaining 
Ian Livingston  Second term  1 year and 3 months remaining 
Brian Wilson  Third term  1 year and 11 months remaining
Tom Allison and Dermot Desmond each retire annually.
Remuneration of Directors
Directors' remuneration and benefits for the year to  
30 June 2012 are set out in the table above. 
Remuneration of non-executive Directors is for service 
on the Board and its Committees and is reviewed by the 
Board as a whole each year against fees in comparable 
companies of a similar size and taking account of overall 
financial performance of the Company.
