 The principal function of the Remuneration Committee is to determine, on behalf of the Board, the remuneration and other benefits of the
executive Directors, including pension contributions, share options, bonus payments and service contracts. The fees paid to non-executive
Directors are determined by the Board as a whole. Non-executive Directors do not receive bonuses or pension contributions.
The Committee gives full consideration to the provisions set out in Schedule B of the Combined Code annexed to the Listing Rules of the
London Stock Exchange in determining appropriate remuneration packages.
The Remuneration Committee now comprises of Mr Ronald Irwin and Mr Tim Wright the non-executive Directors and also the Chairman, 
Mr Alan Goodman.
The Remuneration package
The Remuneration Committee is aware that it must attract and retain individuals of the highest calibre by continuing to offer packages that
are fair and reasonable for the responsibilities involved. The Committee endeavours to ensure that such packages are sufficiently dependent
on achievement to motivate individuals to continue to contribute to the success of the Company. The Remuneration Committee is sensitive
to the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Company when considering executive pay and annual salary increases. The
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee is Mr Ronald Irwin.
Basic salary - the basic salary of each executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the individual's
performance, the achievement of personal objectives and basic salaries in companies whose activities and size are comparable to those of
CeNeS Pharmaceuticals plc.
Bonus arrangements - Director' bonuses are discretionary and are approved by the Remuneration Committee. No bonuses were awarded
to Directors in 2001 or 2002.
Pension contributions - the group makes defined contributions to personal pension arrangements on behalf of the executive Directors at a
defined percentage of salary, excluding bonus, car allowance or other forms of remuneration.
Share options - all executive Directors are entitled to participate in the Company's share option schemes. The performance criteria for the
share option schemes are disclosed on page 25. Any options granted thereunder are approved by the Remuneration Committee.

(1) Each of Mr A G Goodman, Mr A G Goodman's spouse, Mrs E Goodman, Mr N R Clark and Dr J W Buckle have entered into option
agreements with CeNeS Limited pursuant to which they have a right to subscribe at par for a number of shares in CeNeS Limited. In the
event that the option is exercised (the end date for exercising being seven years from the date of grant of the option) the optionholder will be
under an obligation to transfer his ordinary shares in CeNeS Limited to CeNeS Pharmaceuticals plc in return for approximately 20.31 10p
ordinary shares for each CeNeS Limited ordinary share.

900 companies (excluding investment companies) ranked according to the growth in TSR over that period. Options may be exercised over

price over a three year period (starting with the date of the grant of the option) must exceed the growth in total shareholder return (TSR ) for
the FTSE A All-Share 900 (excluding investment companies) over that period. Options may be exercisable in full only if the growth in the
Company's share price over a fixed three year period commencing on the date of grant would put the Company at the same level or above
the median company of the FTSE All-Share 900 Companies (excluding investment companies) ranked according to the growth in TSR over
that period. If the performance target is not met over the fixed three year period, it may be re-tested over a four year period or a five year
period (each period having the same start date).
