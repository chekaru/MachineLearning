 CeNeS Pharmaceuticals plc Annual Report 2004 27
The principal function of the Remuneration Committee is to determine, on behalf of the Board, the remuneration and other benefits of the
Executive Directors, including pension contributions, share options, bonus payments and service contracts. The fees paid to Non-executive
Directors are determined by the Board as a whole. Non-executive Directors do not receive bonuses or pension contributions.
The Committee gives full consideration to the provisions set out in Schedule B of the Combined Code annexed to the Listing Rules of the
London Stock Exchange in determining appropriate remuneration packages.
The Remuneration package
The Remuneration Committee is aware that it must attract and retain individuals of the highest calibre by continuing to offer packages that
are fair and reasonable for the responsibilities involved. The Committee endeavours to ensure that such packages are sufficiently dependent
on achievement to motivate individuals to continue to contribute to the success of the Company. The Remuneration Committee is sensitive
to the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Company when considering executive pay and annual salary increases. The
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee is Dr Peter Johnson.
Basic salary - the basic salary of each executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the individual's
performance, the achievement of personal objectives and basic salaries in companies whose activities and size are comparable to those of
CeNeS Pharmaceuticals plc.
Bonus arrangements - Director' bonuses are discretionary and are approved by the Remuneration Committee. The bonuses are linked to
performance against specific targets for the group. The maximum achievable bonus is not normally to be above 50%. Details of bonuses
awarded for 2004 are shown in the table on page 29.
Pension contributions - the group makes defined contributions to personal pension arrangements on behalf of the Executive Directors at a
defined percentage of 10% of salary, excluding bonus, car allowance or other forms of remuneration.
Share options - all Executive Directors are entitled to participate in the Company's share option schemes. The performance criteria for the
share option schemes are disclosed on page 30. Any options granted thereunder are approved by the Remuneration Committee.

(1) Each of Mr A G Goodman, Mr A G Goodman's spouse, Mrs E Goodman and Mr N R Clark have entered into option agreements with
CeNeS Limited pursuant to which they have a right to subscribe at par for a number of shares in CeNeS Limited. In the event that the
option is exercised (the end date for exercising being seven years from the date of grant of the option) the optionholder will be under an
obligation to transfer his ordinary shares in CeNeS Limited to CeNeS Pharmaceuticals plc in return for approximately 20.31 1p ordinary
shares for each CeNeS Limited ordinary share.
(2) These options have been granted under the CeNeS Pharmaceuticals plc Executive Share Option Plan and have a performance target
linked to the FTSE A All-Share 900 companies' performance over a period of three years (see note 5).
(3) Options granted under the CeNeS Pharmaceuticals plc Unapproved Share Option Scheme (see note 6).
(4) Subject to the rules of the relevant option scheme and the agreement of the Remuneration Committee, Directors and employees may
have the right to exercise their options awarded under the relevant schemes within a six month period following the termination of their
employment contracts.
(5) Performance condition schedule for the CeNeS Pharmaceuticals plc Executive Share Option Plan - The Performance Target is that the
growth in the Company's share price over a three year period (starting with the date of grant of the Option) must exceed the growth in total
shareholder return (TSR ) for the FTSE A All-Share 900 companies (excluding investment companies) over that period. Options may be
exercised in full only if the growth of the Company's share price over a three year period commencing on the date of grant would put the
Company at the same level or above the Company which is ranked 225th (with the Company being granted 1st) of the FTSE A All-Share
900 companies (excluding investment companies) ranked according to the growth in TSR over that period. Options may be exercised over
half the number of shares in the Company to which they relate if the growth in the Company's share price over a fixed three year period
commencing on the date of grant would put the Company at the same level or above the median company of the FTSE A All-Share 900
companies (excluding investment companies) ranked according to growth in TSR over that period. If the Performance Target is not met over
the fixed three year period, it shall be re-tested over a four year period or a five year period (each period having the same start date). If the
Performance Target is not met, the Option will lapse.
(6) Performance condition schedule for the CeNeS Pharmaceuticals plc Approved and Unapproved Share Option schemes - The exercise of
the option will be subject to the satisfaction of a performance target. The performance target is that the growth in the Company's share
price over a three year period (starting with the date of the grant of the option) must exceed the growth in total shareholder return (TSR ) for
the FTSE A All-Share 900 (excluding investment companies) over that period. Options may be exercisable in full only if the growth in the
Company's share price over a fixed three year period commencing on the date of grant would put the Company at the same level or above
the median company of the FTSE All-Share 900 Companies (excluding investment companies) ranked according to the growth in TSR over
that period. If the performance target is not met over the fixed three year period, it may be re-tested over a four year period or a five year
period (each period having the same start date).
The market price of the Company's shares at 31 December 2004 was 7.25p.
The highest and lowest prices during the year were 15.0p and 7.25p respectively.
