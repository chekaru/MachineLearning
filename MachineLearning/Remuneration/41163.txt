fair and reasonable for the responsibilities involved. the Committee endeavours to ensure that such packages are sufficiently dependent on 
achievement to motivate individuals to continue to contribute to the success of the Company. The Remuneration Committee is sensitive to the 
pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Company when considering executive pay and annual salary increases. the Remuneration 
Committee comprises dr peter Johnson (Chairman) and Mr Ronald irwin. Mr Alan goodman is an ex officio member who exempts himself 
from meetings where his own remuneration is considered.
There were three meetings in 2007 and all members were present.

performance, the achievement of personal objectives and basic salaries in companies whose activities and size are comparable to those of 
CeNeS Pharmaceuticals plc.
Bonus arrangements - directors' bonuses are discretionary and are approved by the Remuneration Committee. the bonuses are linked 
to performance against specific targets for the group. the maximum achievable bonus is not normally to be above 50% of basic salary.
