7. TAX
Tax recognised in profit is summarised as follows:
Tax consolidation
Relevance of tax consolidation to the consolidated entity
The Company and its wholly-owned Australian resident entities formed a tax-consolidated Group with effect from 1 July 
2003. The head entity within the tax-consolidated Group is Centamin Egypt Limited. The members of the tax-consolidated 
Group are identified at Note 21.
Nature of tax funding arrangements and tax sharing agreements
Entities within the tax-consolidated Group have entered into a tax funding arrangement and a tax-sharing agreement with 
the head entity. Under the terms of the tax funding agreement, Centamin Egypt Limited and each of the entities in the tax-
consolidated Group has agreed to pay a tax equivalent payment to or from the head entity, based on the current tax liability 
or current tax asset of the entity. Such amounts are reflected in amounts receivable from or payable to other entities in the 
tax-consolidated Group.
The tax sharing agreement entered into between members of the tax-consolidated Group provides for the determination of 
the allocation of income tax liabilities between the entities should the head entity default on its tax payment obligations. No 
amounts have been recognised in the financial statements in respect of this agreement as payment of any amounts under 
the tax sharing agreement is considered remote.
8. SEGMENT REPORTING
The Group is engaged in the business of exploration and mining of precious and base metals only, which represents a 
single operating segment. The Board is the Group's chief operating decision maker within the meaning of IFRS 8.

During the year US$295,000 (2010: US$ nil) of inventory has been written off to other operating costs. 
The tax rate used in the above reconciliation is the corporate tax rate of 30% payable by Australian corporate entities on 
taxable profits under the Australian tax law. There has been no change in the corporate tax rate when compared to the 
previous financial period.
Trade and other receivables are classified as loans and receivables and are therefore measured at amortised cost. The 
average age of the receivables is 32 days (2010: 1 day). No interest is charged on the receivables. There are no trade 
receivables past due and impaired at the reporting date, and thus no allowance for doubtful debts has been recognised. 
Of the trade receivables balance, the gold sales debtor is all receivable from Johnson Matthey of Canada. The amount due 
has been received subsequent to year-end and was considered to be fully recoverable. 
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables is approximately equal to their fair value.

In the prior year the commencement of the commercial production of the open pit mine has resulted in US$41,360,000 of 
exploration and evaluation assets being transferred to mine development properties. The costs transferred were incurred 
before commercial production commenced and were capitalised to exploration and evaluation assets in note 13.
The available for sale financial asset at year-end relates to a 14% equity interest in Nyota Minerals Limited (NYO ), a listed 
public company. Management are not planning on divesting from this investment in the foreseeable future. Subsequent to

been recorded as there is no financial information available for the associate since the acquisition. The associate holds 
exploration rights and continues to explore.

the tax advisory services and the IPO and related services, than the team performing the audit.
The Audit Committee and the external auditor have safeguards in place to avoid the possibility that the auditor's objectivity

external auditor for non-audit related services. 
Where it is deemed that the work to be undertaken is of a nature that is generally considered reasonable to be completed 
by the auditor of the Company for sound commercial and practical reasons, the conduct of such work will be permissible

(CONTINUED)
Capital commitments arising from the Group's interests in joint ventures are disclosed in Note 19.
Through its wholly owned subsidiary, PGM, the Company entered into the Concession Agreement with EMRA and the 
Arab Republic of Egypt granting PGM and EMRA the right to explore, develop, mine and sell gold and associated minerals 
in specific concession areas located in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. The Concession Agreement came into effect under 
Egyptian law on 13 June 1995. 
In 2001 PGM, together with EMRA, were granted an Exploitation Lease over 160 square kilometers surrounding the Sukari 
Project site. The Exploitation Lease was signed by PGM, EMRA and the Egyptian Minister of Petroleum and gives tenure 
for a period of 30 years, commencing 24 May 2005 and extendable by PGM for an additional 30 years upon PGM providing 
reasonable commercial justification. 
In 2006 SGM, was incorporated under the laws of Egypt. SGM was formed to conduct exploration, development, 
exploitation and marketing operations in accordance with the Concession Agreement. Responsibility for the day-to-day 
management of the Project rests with the General Manger, who is appointed by PGM. 
The fiscal terms of the Concession Agreement require that PGM solely funds the SGM. PGM is however entitled to recover 
from sales revenue recoverable costs, as defined in the Concession Agreement. EMRA is entitled to a share of SGM's 
net production surplus (defined as revenue less payment of the fixed royalty to ARE and recoverable costs). As at 31 
December 2011, PGMs has not recovered its cost and accordingly, no EMRA entitlement has been recognized to date, It 
is anticipated that the first payment to EMRA will become payable during 2012, Any payment made to EMRA pursuant to 
these provisions of the Concession Agreement will be recognised as a variable royalty charge to the income statement. 
The Concession Agreement grants certain tax exemptions, including the following: 
   From 1 April 2010, being the date of Commercial Production, the Sukari Project is entitled to a 15 year exemption from 
any taxes imposed by the Egyptian government on the revenues generated from the Sukari Project. PGM and EMRA 
intend that SGM will in due course file an application to extend the tax-free period for a further 15 years. The extension 
of the tax-free period requires that there has been no tax problems or disputes in the initial period and that certain 
activities in new remote areas have been planned and agreed by all parties; 
   PGM and SGM are exempt from custom taxes and duties with respect to the importation of machinery, equipment and 
consumable items required for the purpose of exploration and mining activities at the Sukari Project. The exemption 
shall only apply if there is no local substitution with the same of similar quality to the imported machinery, equipment or 
consumables. Such exemption will also be granted if the local substitution is more than 10% more expensive than the 
imported machinery, equipment or consumables after the additional of the insurance and transportation costs; 
   PGM, EMRA and SGM and their respective buyers will be exempt from any duties or taxes on the export of gold and 
associated minerals produced from the Sukari Project; 
   PGM at all times is free to transfer in US dollars or other freely convertible foreign currency any cash of PGM 
representing its share of net proceeds and recovery of costs, without any Egyptian government limitation, tax or duty; 
and 
   PGM's contractors and sub-contractors are entitled to import machinery. Equipment and consumable items under the 
Temporary Release System  which provided exemption from Egyptian customs duty. 
No potential ordinary shares were excluded from the calculation of weighted average number of ordinary shares for the 
purpose of diluted earnings per share.

(b) Financial risk management and objectives
The Group's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise 
potential risk adverse effects and ensure that net cash flows are sufficient to support the delivery of the Group's financial 
targets whilst protecting future financial security. The Group continually monitors and tests its forecast financial position 
against these objectives.
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market; commodity; credit; liquidity; foreign exchange; 
and interest rate. These risks are managed under Board approved directives through the Audit Committee. The Group's 
principal financial instruments comprise interest bearing cash and cash equivalents. Other financial instruments include 
trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, Group policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments be 
undertaken.
