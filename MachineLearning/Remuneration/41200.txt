Remuneration Report
The following section of this remuneration report  
has not been audited by Deloitte LLP. 
Introduction from Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee
During the Financial Year ended 31 December 2012 the 
Remuneration Committee comprised three independent 
non-executive Directors and myself as Chairman. The 
Committee met three times during the year and was 
supported by the Company Secretary who also acts as 
secretary to the Committee.
Mindful of the feedback from some institutional 
shareholders the Committee undertook a review of 
all aspects of the executives' remuneration and in 
particular the introduction of safety targets which if not 
achieved would reduce any bonus otherwise payable 
by a proportionate amount. In conducting this review 
the Committee was conscious not only of the need to 
balance the return to shareholders with the need to 
motivate and retain the executive team but also of the 
need to create a remuneration structure that would:
 Lock in the key individuals
 Reduce the overall remuneration potential for the 
Chairman and other directors 
 Enhance the link between individual and  
corporate performance
 Be simpler to operate 
 Address certain governance issues relating  
to notice periods
The work the Committee has undertaken to take account 
of the above has been to:
 Change the annual bonus arrangements
 Agree a new service agreement with the Chairman
 Establish new long-term incentive arrangements 
under which the executive directors are no longer 
able to participate
In addition, base salaries have been adjusted to be  
in line with those of similar sized mining companies 
and we have introduced both short and long term 
incentive plans for senior management with defined key 
performance indicators. These changes are described  
in more detail below.
In considering levels of remuneration, the Committee 
took into account the performance of the Company, 
which saw an improvement in all the major  
operational indicators.
 Gold production: up 5.2% on expectations
 Cost of production: US$30 lower per ounce  
than targeted
 Revenue: 25% increased to US$426million  
from US$340million in 2011
 An increase in profit since 2011
 Improved health and safety performance
The executive directors have been very supportive 
of these initiatives, including in particular the 
Chairman Josef El-Raghy, who with no corresponding 
compensation, voluntarily agreed to sacrifice his 2011 
share award over 1 million shares as well as to the 
acceptance of substantial changes to his employment 
conditions, including the removal of a 24 month notice 
period which had been applicable in the event of  
a change of control.
Finally, the Committee again discussed the combining 
of the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive under 
one person. Whilst recognizing that this does not 
conform to best practice, the Committee concluded, 
nevertheless, that the current arrangement remained 
in the shareholders' best interests but agreed that as 
Senior Independent Director I would, as detailed in the 
Chairman's Statement on page 14, take on additional 
responsibilities that will include the chairmanship of the 
Company's meetings. 
G. Edward Haslam
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 73
Remuneration Governance
The Committee
As mentioned above, the Committee currently comprises 
four non-executive directors all of whom are regarded as 
wholly independent. 
No member of the Committee has any financial interest, 
other than as shareholder, in the matters decided by 
the Committee. None of the members of the Committee 
participate in any bonus scheme, long term incentive, 
pension or other form of remuneration other than the fees 
disclosed below (other than statutory superannuation 
for the Australian resident directors). There is no actual 
or potential conflict of interest arising from the other 
directorships held by members of the Committee.
The members of the Committee, joining dates and 
number of meetings attended during the year are shown 
in the table below. The Company Secretary acts as 
secretary to the Committee.

Terms of Reference
The responsibilities of the Committee include:
 Framework of remuneration for the company and in 
particular the executive team
 Remuneration of executive directors 
 Long term incentives
Advisers
During the year the Committee was supported by the 
Company Secretary. Centamin commissioned research 
papers from Meis on executive remuneration levels and 
share scheme practice, which were made available to 
the Committee. Meis was subsequently appointed as 
adviser to the Committee. Advice was also received from 
the Company's legal counsel, Norton Rose in London 
and Canada in respect of the deferred bonus plan and 
service agreements. Other than advice on executive 
remuneration Meis provides no other services to the 
Company. Norton Rose provides on going legal advice to 
the Company.
The Chairman attends meetings of the Committee to 
make recommendations relating to the performance and 
remuneration of his direct reports. The Chairman and the 
Company Secretary are not in attendance at meetings 
when their own remuneration is under consideration.
Matters Considered by the Committee
The Committee considered the following items during  
the year:
 Review of executive director remuneration 
 The proposed structure of the share scheme 
arrangements for employees and the executive team 
 The introduction of the new deferred bonus plan and 
the grant of awards under the plan 
 New service agreement for the Chairman
 The provision of advice to the Committee
 The annual bonus plan for 2012
 The annual bonus plan for 2013
Remuneration policy for 2012 and 2013
Introduction
In developing its remuneration policy the Committee has 
had regard to the fact that the business of the Company  
is operated outside the UK and in a market which requires 
very particular operational and managerial skills.  
The remuneration policy therefore seeks to:
 Position remuneration packages to ensure that they 
remain competitive, taking account of all elements  
of remuneration and reflective of the performance  
of the Company
 Use external benchmark data on a transparent and 
open basis using comparator groups that reflect the 
industry and size of the Company
 Provide incentive arrangements for relevant 
employees that are based upon pre agreed 
performance criteria that individuals will then be 
tested against.  Such incentives should be relevant 
and stretching. A balanced score card  approach  
to annual bonuses will generally be adopted
 Provide long term incentives that encourage the 
involvement, in the long term, of the performance of 
the Company. Performance criteria should be relevant 
and capable of being influenced. Executive directors 
will, from 2012, no longer be offered participation in 
any long term incentive arrangements 
 Encourage executives, and in particular executive 
directors, to build and then maintain a meaningful 
shareholding in the Company 74 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Remuneration Summary for Executive Directors
ELEMENT OBJECTIVE DETAILS
Base pay Base pay to be set competitively 
so as to allow the motivation and 
retention of executives
Normally reviewed in the first quarter  
of year with changes effective as  
of 1st January.
Salaries are benchmarked against 
a number of comparator groups as 
described below to provide a balanced 
approach.
Pension Positioned to ensure competitive 
packages. 
The Chairman receives a cash payment in 
lieu of a pension equivalent to 20% of his 
base salary. A 20% contribution rate is 
the market median for the FTSE 250.
Benefits There are no benefits
Annual Bonus To provide a reward for short term 
performance
Performance criteria set at the beginning 
of the year based upon a balanced 
score card approach. For the Chairman 
a maximum annual bonus opportunity is 
175% and for other executive director, 
whose performance criteria are strongly 
linked to the completion of Stage 4, a 
multi-year project , no annual bonus 
opportunity has been fixed.
Share Ownership Requirement To encourage ownership of shares 
and thereby create a link of interest 
between shareholder and executive
Although the Company has no formal 
policy, executive directors are encouraged 
over time, to acquire shares of a value of 
not less than 100% of their base salary. 
This is consistent with the market practice 
for the FTSE 250. Executive directors 
already exceed this requirement.
Long Term Incentive To link an executives interest to the 
longer term share performance
The current intention is to make no 
further awards under the loan funded 
schemes. For management, but not 
directors, the Company has introduced 
a deferred bonus scheme as part of the 
annual bonus. The Company can require 
up to 100% of a bonus to be deferred into 
shares. Such shares will then be released 
as to a third at the end of each of 12, 24 
and 36 month period. For the executive 
directors the Committee is of the view, 
following the review, that the existing 
shareholdings of the directors already 
create sufficient union of interest between 
executives and shareholders.

Balance of Remuneration
The balance of remuneration for 2013 is shown in the graph below and is based upon maximum pay-out for Josef 
El-Raghy. The graph does not however show the bonus opportunity for Trevor Schultz, which has not yet been fixed. 
Please refer to the text under the heading 2012 Bonus  below for more detail.

Base Pension Annual Variable
0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%
Relationship between pay and performance
It is important that executive pay is grounded in the good performance of the Company. While the operational 
performance of the Company over 2012 (a summary of which is set out in the Performance Highlights  section above) 
has been impressive, the pre-tax profit growth and share price performance over the longer term were also taken into 
account by the Committee. Total shareholder return performance against the FTSE 250 and the FTSE 350 Mining 
indices, which are regarded as being appropriate comparator groups for the Company are shown in the graph below.

Remuneration Paid 
Remuneration History for Josef El-Raghy
The remuneration packages of the executive directors, and in particular Josef El-Raghy, have been restructured  
so as to reduce the overall remuneration opportunity. The following table shows the remuneration history and future 
potential for Josef El-Raghy. The table shows both the maximum opportunity under the remuneration package and the 
actual achieved/paid. As can be seen the total remuneration opportunity has been substantial reduced in 2012 and  
is further reduced in 2013.

Remuneration Report 77
Base salaries 
Base salaries are usually reviewed in the first quarter 
of each year. However, as part of the remuneration 
review that was undertaken in the middle of 2012, 
Josef El-Raghy's remuneration was considered against 
companies of similar complexity and size (bespoke 
group) and, as was noted in last year's remuneration 
report, his remuneration was shown to be materially 
below the median. Consideration was also given to  
the remuneration information obtained from four 
additional groups of comparable companies in order  
to gain a balanced view of the market data. The groups 
are the FTSE 250, the Mining Sector, companies with  
a similar market capitalisation, and finally companies 
with a similar turnover. As a result of this exercise,  
Josef El-Raghy base salary was increased with effect 
from July 2012 to bring him into line with the median  
of the data and allow the restructuring of his 
remuneration package.
In deciding to increase the base pay of Josef El-Raghy 
his position against the market data was only one of the 
factors taken into account.  The following factors were 
also taken into account:
 When appointed in 2010 he was given an increase 
which did not take his base pay to the median position 
for his new position. In the subsequent year his base 
pay was frozen and without an increase in 2012 his 
base pay would fall further behind the market.
 The removal of long term incentives substantially 
reduce the overall value of his package and therefore 
it was appropriate to position the base pay at no lower 
than the median.
 A desire to maintain a consistency across the 
business of the Company by paying a market rate  
at about the median.
The base of Trevor Schultz was A$ 550,000 ( 351,000) 
in 2012.
Approach to Annual Bonuses
The bonus plan for the executive directors is based upon 
a balanced score card approach designed to encourage 
and reward the delivery of operational performance.  
The bonus is split 70% business and 30% individual 
targets. In particular:
 The business targets are based on financial, 
operational, strategic measures and specific business 
tasks. These targets therefore capture both the 
normal financial targets as well as operational targets 
such as health and safety, production targets and 
efficiency, new exploration and M&A opportunities 
and business diversity. 
 The individual targets reflect the delivery of individual 
task as well as leadership and management.
Furthermore in assessing the bonus to be paid to Josef 
El-Raghy, the Committee took into consideration the fact 
that his overall remuneration opportunity was reduced 
in the course of 2012 by the voluntary forfeiture, without 
payment, of shares awarded to him under the Director 
Loan Funded Share Plan 2011.
2012 Bonus 
The Committee during the year reviewed the annual 
bonus scheme and the bonus scheme that operated for 
substantially all of 2012 which was based upon the same 
balanced score card approach as above. On this basis the 
Committee determined that 80% of the maximum bonus 
of 175% of Josef El-Raghy's 2012 base salary had been 
achieved by Josef El-Raghy. This reflects the operational 
performance of the Company with many of the targets 
being met or exceeded. No bonus was awarded to Trevor 
Schultz as his remuneration structure is strongly linked to 
the stage 4 expansion project and whilst good progress 
was made it was decided that only upon satisfactory 
completion of stage 4 will any bonus become payable. 
The sum of A$750,000 (US$777,847) has been provided 
for as at 31 December 2012 representing that amount of 
the bonus which may become payable to Trevor Schultz 
upon satisfactory completion of the Stage 4 project.
2013
The bonus for 2013 will be based upon the balanced 
score card approach above. 78 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Pension Arrangements and Benefits in Kind
Josef El-Raghy is entitled to a payment in respect  
of pension entitlement equal to 20% base pay.  
Trevor Schultz has no such entitlement. Other than 
statutory superannuation for Australian resident 
directors, Professor Robert Bowker and Mr. Mark 
Arnesen and the payments in lieu of pension above,  
no pensions or payments in lieu of pensions are made. 
No benefits in kind are provided to any director.
Service Agreements for Executive Directors
During the year, and as part of the review, Josef El-Raghy 
voluntarily agreed to the early cancellation of his service 
agreement, without compensation, and agreed to enter 
into a new service agreement. The new contract, dated 
24 September 2012, provides for 12 months' notice by 
either party to terminate the contract and does not provide 
for an enhanced notice period in the case of a change  
of control. However, in the case of notice given in 
connection with and shortly following a change of control, 
Josef El-Raghy will be entitled to payment in lieu of an 
amount equal to 12 month's basic salary together with  
any bonus that, in the opinion of the Remuneration 
Committee, would have been due to him in the 12 month 
period following the giving of the notice.
The service agreement for Trevor Schultz dated  
15 August 2008 provides for six months' notice from  
the company and three months from Trevor Schultz  
to terminate the agreement.
Shareholding Requirement
While the Board has not adopted a formal shareholding 
requirement for executive directors it is keeping this matter 
under review and further monitors the actual shareholding 
to ensure that the actual holding is equal to or exceeds 
the current market practice for the FTSE 250, which is 
typically that such number of shares should be held the 
aggregate market value of which on the date of purchase 
is greater than 100% of the annual base salary.  
Both Josef El-Raghy's and Trevor Schultz's shareholdings 
significantly exceed this amount.
Non-Executive Directors
Under the Articles of Association adopted by the 
Company all directors are now subject to annual 
re-election. All members of the Board offered 
themselves for either election or re-election at the  
last Annual General Meeting of the Company.
Long Term Incentive Arrangements 
Introduction
Centamin has a number of share schemes intended to 
facilitate employee and executive participation in the 
capital value of the Company. A number of these share 
schemes were developed to take account of Australian 
tax law. With the review this year the Committee felt that 
the existing schemes were too complex and failed to 
provide any meaningful motivation or link to shareholder 
interests. The following table shows a summary of the 
plans and details on their operation.
This year a new, simple deferred bonus share plan has 
been adopted to replace participation in the other plans.

Employee Loan Funded Share Plan 2011
This is the roll-over plan for the Centamin Egypt Ltd 
2011 Employee Loan Funded Share Plan.  Under the 
plan, employees receive a loan to buy shares in the 
Company.  The shares are then held in trust for the 
employee and at the end of three years the employees 
can repay the loan and receive the shares. The loan 
is subject to a maximum repayment period of 3 years.  
Shares under this plan vest in tranches on the first, 
second and third year following grant and vesting is 
subject to the satisfaction of applicable performance 
criteria and the performance criteria in respect of senior 
management are based upon share price, financial, 
production or key tasks.  Comparator companies, where 
used, are selected by the Remuneration Committee from 
peers in the mining sector.
As indicated above, there is no current intention to make 
further awards under this scheme.
Director Loan Funded Share Plan 2011
This is again a roll-over plan of the Centamin Egypt 2011 
Executive Director Loan Funded Share Plan.  The plan 
operates in exactly the same way as the Employee Plan, 
except that there are mandatory performance conditions 
attached to the Director Plan, and that the shares vest 
in one tranche, three years from the date of grant.  The 
release of award is dependent upon the achievement of 
comparative Total Shareholder Return with 50% based 
upon the FTSE 250 and 50% based upon comparator 
companies.  25% of the award will vest for median 
performance and 100% for upper quartile performance 
under each element.   Comparator companies are selected 
by the Remuneration Committee from peers in the mining 
sector and are as follows: New Gold Inc, Centerra Gold 
Inc; Randgold Resources; Hochschild Mining; Alamos 
Gold Inc; European Goldfields Ltd; Eldorado Gold Corp; 
African Barrick Gold; Petropavlovsk Plc.
As indicated above, there is no current intention to make 
further awards under this scheme.
Employee Share Option Plan
This plan was introduced for UK participants in order to 
provide similar benefits to those which were available to 
participants in the other plans. This plan was established 
as part of the re-domicile given that the provision of loans 
and the holding of shares was not appropriate for UK 
participants. Performance criteria are included in respect 
of senior management based upon share price, financial, 
production or key tasks. Comparator companies are 
selected by the Remuneration Committee from peers in 
the mining sector.
Shareholding 
There is no formal shareholding requirement but the 
directors are encouraged to hold a meaningful quantity 
of shares. The following table shows the current 
shareholding of each of the directors. Josef El-Raghy's 
holding is 6.44%.

AUDITED SECTION
The following section of this remuneration report has been audited by Deloitte LLP.
Non-Executive Director Fees
Non-Executive directors receive annual fees within an aggregate Directors' fee pool limited to an amount which is 
approved by shareholders. The Committee reviews and recommends, for Board approval, remuneration levels and 
policies for Directors within this overall Directors' fee pool. The fees which are paid are also periodically reviewed.  
The current annual fee rate for non-executive directors is as follows:
Previous (until early 2011) As at 31 December 2012
Annual Base Fee
A$40,000 (US$41,316)  50,000 (US$79,235)

Senior Independent  
Non-Executive Director
A$Nil (US$Nil)  10,000 (US$15,847)
These amounts include any statutory superannuation payments where applicable.
The Company has not reviewed the fees of the non-executive directors during the year but has determined to 
commission a review in 2013. No increase in non-executive director fees was awarded during the year save that, with 
effect from 1 March 2013, the fees payable to Gordon Edward Haslam in his capacity as Senior Independent Director 
were increased such that, for so long as the roles of CEO and Chairman are combined, the total fees paid to him, on an 
annual basis, would be  125,000 (US$198,088) per year. In keeping with the Company's policy, G. Edward Haslam 
did not participate in any meeting during which his fees were discussed.
The non-executive directors do not participate in any of the Company's share plans or incentive plans.
