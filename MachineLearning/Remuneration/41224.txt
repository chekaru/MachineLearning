Remuneration report
Statement by the Chairman of the  
Remuneration Committee, Ed Haslam
Edward Haslam
Chairman of the  
Remuneration Committee
Dear shareholders
1. Introduction and annual statement
Background to remuneration decisions
While this year has continued to be challenging, the Company has been 
successful in a number of important ways: 
 	 year gold production 356,943 oz (36% increase on 2012);
 	 cash operating costs of under US$663 per ounce (below budget of US$700 
per ounce);
 	 safety record of 0.36 LTIFR in 2013 (48% reduction on the prior year);
 	 Stage 4 expansion project largely on time and on budget (total capital 
expenditure estimate of US$331.2 million);
 	 strong financial position US$106 million cash and liquid assets at year end;
 	 systematic exploration continued both at Sukari and Ethiopia, although 
only low grade mineralisation discovered resulting in the write down and 
relinquishing of the licence areas; and
 	 M&A activity culminated in a recommended takeover offer of Ampella Mining 
Ltd to extend exploration into prospective and stable Burkina Faso.
Therefore, while there are still challenges in respect of the litigation, details of 
which are set out in Note 20 to the financial statements, from an operational and 
financial perspective this has been a successful year and it is within that context 
that the key remuneration decisions for 2013 described below have been taken.
Last year some shareholders expressed concerns about certain aspects of the 
remuneration policy and practice. We have been working on those concerns and 
I would like to thank the shareholders, whom I had an opportunity to meet this 
year, for their constructive feedback on the Remuneration Report. I will continue 
to engage with shareholders throughout 2014. 
Simple approach to remuneration
We continue to be wedded to a simpler remuneration structure for the executive 
directors with only three elements of remuneration for Josef El Raghy, base pay, 
contribution to a pension and annual bonus and two elements for Trevor Schultz, 
base pay and annual bonus. As described below we are not proposing any changes 
in this policy for the coming year. We believe this simple approach allows a cleaner 
line of sight for the delivery of performance in the short term while meaningful 
actual shareholdings means the executives' wealth is directly linked to the fortunes 
of other shareholders. There is no better union of interest between shareholder and 
executives than for executives to be substantial shareholders in their own right.
As reported last year Josef El Raghy no longer participates in any long term 
incentive plans, the committee being of the view the his significant shareholding is 
a sufficient link to shareholders' interests. Trevor Schultz award of 1,000,000 shares 
under the terms of the Directors Loan Funded Share Plan failed to achieve the 
necessary performance criteria, after the year end and therefore it was agreed that 
these awards lapse. He will receive no further awards for long term incentives.
For employees the complex loan funded arrangements that previously existed 
have been replaced with one simple Deferred Bonus Share Plan. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Changes in the Board
Trevor Schultz is due to stand down as an executive director 
prior to the AGM in 2014. This will coincide with the final 
stages of commissioning and handover to operations of the 
Stage 4 expansion project. Trevor Schultz is expected to be 
appointed as a non executive director and put forward for 
re election at the AGM to be held on 16 May 2014.
Key remuneration decisions for 2013
Base salary for Josef El Raghy was GB 500,000 
(US$782,112) for 2013 and remains at this level for 
2014. The next review will make any changes with effect 
from January 2015. Trevor Schultz base was A$550,000 
(US$526,768) for 2013 and this will continue for 2014 at the 
same rate while holding the position of executive director.
For 2013 a pension is provided as a cash supplement 
of 20% of base for Josef El Raghy. He receives no other 
benefits. For Trevor Schultz there is no pension or benefit 
provision. This will remain the same in both cases for 2014. 
The bonus opportunity and structure for 2013 will remain 
the same as 2014. For Josef El Raghy a maximum bonus 
opportunity is 175%. The bonus calculation is made 
by reference to a balanced scorecard which comprises 
a combination of financial, operational and individual 
performance criteria. 
The bonus outcome for Josef El Raghy for 2013 was a 
bonus of 75% of the maximum opportunity which equates 
to GB 656,250 (US$1,082,028) and represents 131.25% of 
base salary.
For Trevor Schultz, as disclosed last year, a bonus of 
A$750,000 (US$777,847) was accrued in 2012 in respect 
of performance in 2012 and payment of this was approved 
by the Remuneration Committee in December 2013. 
A further bonus of A$500,000 (US$443,616) for 2013 and 
2014 performance may be paid in 2014 (representing 90% 
of base pay). The bonus amounts were and are based 
upon progress towards and the successful commissioning 
and hand over to operations of Stage 4 (see section 4,  
annual bonus ).

Advisers to the Committee
During the year the Committee was supported by the 
Company Secretary. Following a review in 2012 Meis was 
appointed as adviser to the Committee in respect of its 
work on executive remuneration. Meis does not provide 
any other service to the Company and is regarded as 
independent by the Committee. Meis is engaged on an 
annual retainer for GB 7,000 for a twelve month period.
Josef El Raghy may attend meetings of the Committee to 
make recommendations relating to the performance and 
remuneration of his direct reports but neither he nor the 
Company Secretary are in attendance at meetings when 
their own remunerations are under consideration.
3. Our remuneration policy
Introduction
The remuneration policy will be subject to a non binding 
advisory vote at the AGM on 16 May 2014.
In developing its remuneration policy the Committee has 
had regard to the fact that the business of the Company 
is operated outside the UK and in a market which requires 
the engagement; motivation and retention of very 
particular operational and managerial personnel and skills. 
The remuneration policy therefore seeks to:
 	 position remuneration packages to ensure that they 
remain competitive, taking account of all elements of 
remuneration and be reflective of the performance of 
the Company;
 	 use external benchmark data on a transparent and open 
basis using comparator groups that reflect the industry 
and size of the Company;
 	 provide incentive arrangements for relevant employees 
that are based upon pre agreed performance criteria 
against which individuals will then be tested. Such 
incentives should be relevant and stretching;
 	 other than for executive directors, provide long term 
incentives that encourage the involvement, in the long 
term, of the performance of the Company; and
 	 encourage executives, and in particular executive 
directors, to build and then maintain a meaningful 
shareholding in the Company.

ordinarily takes effect from the 1 January.
Salaries are benchmarked against a number 
of comparator groups as described below to 
provide a balanced approach. Increases will take 
account of those of the general workforce.
Increases will take account of the performance 
of the individual and the benchmarked data but 
any increase which exceeds that of the general 
work force may only normally be awarded in 
cases as a result of change in responsibility, or 
the complexity and nature of the role or size of 
the organisation or the pay level becoming out 
of line with the market data.

Remuneration arrangement across the Company
Our remuneration policy for executive directors is consistent 
with that across the Company and intends to attract and 
retain high performing individuals and to reward success. 
Base pay and benefits are set competitively taking account 
of the individual' s performance and market data. Annual 
incentives are typically linked to local business performance 
with a focus on performance against key strategic business 
objectives. Key management team members may also 
receive some of their annual bonus in shares which are 
deferred. At this time there are no all employee share 
arrangements but this is kept under review on a regular basis 
taking account of the locations the Company operates in and 
the appropriateness of share base rewards in such locations.
All employees of Sukari Gold Mine Company (the majority 
of whom are based at the Sukari mine site) are subject to a 
performance related bonus which is linked to the underlying 
operation performance and cost control measures at the 
mine. Further details on employee relations can be found 
on the CSR Report.
Policy if a new director is appointed
The Company has a track record of succession planning and 
growing and promoting talent internally.
When hiring a new executive director, or promoting an 
individual to the Board, the Committee will offer a package 
that is sufficient to attract and motivate while aiming to pay 
no more than is necessary taking account of market data, 
the impact on other existing remuneration arrangements, 
the candidate's location and experience, external market 
influences and internal pay relativities.
The structure of the remuneration package of a new 
executive director will follow the policy above, however 
in certain circumstances, the Committee may use other 
elements of remuneration if it considers appropriate, 
with due regard to the best interests of the shareholders. 
In particular, a service contract that contains a longer initial 
notice period, tapering down to twelve months over a 
set period of time, the buyout of short and or long term 
incentive arrangements (taking account of the performance 
measures on such incentives) as close as possible on a 
comparable basis, the provision of long term incentives 
and the provision of benefits such as housing allowance or 
similar particularly where it is an expatriate appointment.
The Committee may, where necessary and in the interest of 
shareholders, also offer recruitment incentives to facilitate 
the recruitment of an appropriate individual.
Policy on payment for loss of office
The Company's approach to payment on loss of office 
will take account of the circumstances of the termination 
of employment. In the case of a good leaver then the 
individual will be expected to work through the notice 
period and will be entitled to all the benefits under the 
service agreement during that period.
In the case of a termination as a result of poor performance 
or a breach of any of the material terms of the agreement 
then the Company may terminate with immediate effect 
without notice and with no liability to make any further 
payment to the individual other than in respect of amounts 
accrued due at the date of termination.
In the case that the Company wishes to terminate 
the agreement and make a payment in lieu of notice, 
this payment shall be phased in monthly or quarterly 
installments over a period of no longer than twelve months 
(or the notice period if less) and that any payment should 
be reduced in accordance with the duty on the executive 
to mitigate his loss. The Company will consider if any 
bonus amount is to be included in the calculation when 
determining the payment in lieu of notice. Normally, any 
bonus (if included at all) would be restricted to the director's 
actual period of service only.
In the case of notice given in connection with and shortly 
following a change of control then in the case of Josef 
El Raghy he is entitled to payment in lieu of an amount 
equal to twelve month's basic salary plus bonus. Any bonus 
that may be due to him at the completion of the change 
of control, shall be determined by the Remuneration 
Committee, and such bonus (if any) would be based on 
the period only up to the completion of the change of 
control, taking account of all the relevant key performance 
indicators.
The only claw back provisions for executive directors relate 
to holiday taken in advance. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Policy on external Board appointments
The Company encourages the executive directors to 
have non executive external appointments provided that 
such appointments do not adversely impact on the duties 
required to be performed to the Company. Where there are 
external appointments the director will retain any fees for 
such appointments and will not be liable to account to the 
Company for such fees.
Of the executives, Trevor Schultz received remuneration 
from another external appointment. 
For Josef El Raghy the graphs assumes a base salary 
as disclosed in this report of GB 500,000, pension 
contributions of 20% of base being GB 100,000 and bonus 
from zero at the minimum, to 50% of 175% at target, and 
175% of base for the maximum. There are no benefits or 
long term incentive elements. 
For Trevor Schultz a base salary of A$550,000 is assumed 
and a bonus of zero at the minimum, 50% of 90% at target, 
and 90% of base for the maximum. For T. Shultz there are 
no benefits, pension or long term incentives included.

amount accrued in 2013 referred to in this report may be payable in 2014 (see section 4, annual bonus ).
Non executive director fees
Non executive directors receive annual fees within an 
aggregate directors' fee pool limited to an amount which 
is approved by shareholders. The Committee reviews and 
recommends, for Board approval, remuneration levels and 
policies for directors within this overall directors' fee pool. 
The fees which are paid are also periodically reviewed. 
The current annual fee rate for non executive directors is 
as follows:
1. With effect from 1 April 2013, the fees payable to Gordon 
Edward Haslam in his capacity as Senior Independent Director 
were increased such that, for so long as the roles of CEO and 
Chairman are combined, the total fees paid to him, on an annual 
basis, would be GB 150,000 (US$247,231) per year 2012: 
GB 125,000 (US$198,088). In keeping with the Company's 
policy, Edward Haslam did not participate in any meeting during 
which his fees were discussed.
2. These amounts include any statutory superannuation payments 
where applicable.
3.  The Company reviewed the NED fees during 2013. The 
increases in non executive director fees took effect from 
1 April 2013.
4. The non executive directors do not participate in any of the 
Company's share plans or incentive plans. 
Base pay
Remuneration of the executive directors and the senior 
management team is considered against three criteria 
- general pay levels and pay increases throughout the 
Company, the performance and skills of the individual and 
market data.
In respect of market data for the executive directors and 
the senior management team, a selection of five different 
comparator groups are used in order to gain a balanced 
view of the market data. These comparator groups consist 
of a bespoke list of UK and international mining companies, 
companies with a similar market capitalisation, companies 
with a similar turnover, the mining sector and the FTSE 250.

4. Annual remuneration report continued
Base pay continued
Any increase which exceeds that of the general work force 
may only normally be awarded in cases as a result of change 
in responsibility, or the complexity and nature of the role or 
size of the organisation or the pay level becoming out of 
line with the market data. 
Pay is reviewed annually and any change takes effect from 
the 1 January.
While performance of the executive directors has been 
satisfactory the Committee, taking account of market data 
has determined that there will be no increases in base 
pay for 2014. Therefore the base pay for Josef El Raghy 
of GB 500,000 (US$782,112) will remain at this level 
during 2014. The base pay for Trevor Schultz of A$550,000 
(US$526,768) will remain at this level in 2014 and there is no 
increase for 2014 whilst Trevor Schultz holds the position of 
executive director.
Annual bonus
The bonus plan for the executive directors is based upon a 
balanced score card approach designed to encourage and 
reward the delivery of operational performance. For Josef 
El Raghy the bonus is split 70% business and 30% individual 
targets as follows:
 	 70% - the business targets are based on: 
 	 40% - financial (profitability, cost against  
budget and operational efficiency);
 	 20% strategic measures (M&A opportunities, 
exploration in Egypt and other locations, 
project delivery); and
 	 10% corporate (corporate governance improvements, 
health and safety, production guidance and CSR 
development).
 	 30% - the individual tasks are based on building 
management team and motivation, formalisation 
and communications of business strategy, in country 
stakeholder management and shareholder relations.
For Trevor Schultz the structure is weighted to the Stage 4 
expansion project. In 2012, no bonus was paid, but a 
bonus was provided for and after review this was paid to 
Trevor Schultz in 2013. This was based upon the substantial 
satisfactory completion of the Stage 4 expansion project. 
The bonus payable in 2014 is dependent upon the 
successful hand over and commissioning of Stage 4.
The following graph shows the balance of the 
performance criteria.
2013 bonus 
The Committee during the year reviewed the annual 
bonus scheme and the bonus scheme that operated for 
substantially all of 2013, which was based upon the same 
balanced score card approach as above. On this basis 
the Committee determined that 75% of the maximum 
bonus of 175% of Josef El Raghy's 2013 base salary had 
been achieved. This resulted in a payment of GB 656,250 
(US$1,082,028).
In 2012 the Company reserved A$750,000 in respect of 
the satisfactory progression of Stage 4 for Trevor Schultz. 
Notwithstanding considerable adversities it was determined 
that this had been achieved and as a result this sum had 
been earned and was paid in 2013. 
2014 bonus
The bonus for 2014 will be based upon the balanced score 
card approach above.
 	 70% - the business targets:
 	 40% - financial (an improvement in profitability, cost 
against budget and operational efficiency); 
 	 20% strategic measures (M&A opportunities, 
exploration in In Egypt and other locations, project 
delivery); and 
 	 10% corporate (corporate governance improvements, 
health and safety, production guidance CSR 
development).
 	 30% - the individual tasks are based on building 
management team and motivation, formalisation 
and communications of business strategy, in country 
stakeholder management and shareholder relations.
For Trevor Schultz the bonus is based upon the 
satisfactory final commissioning of Stage 4 and hand 
over to Operations. The maximum amount is A$500,000 
(US$443,616).

Pension arrangements and benefits in kind
Josef El Raghy is entitled to a payment in respect of pension 
entitlement equal to 20% of base pay. Trevor Schultz has no 
such entitlement. Other than statutory superannuation for 
Australian resident directors, Bob Bowker and Mark Arnesen 
and the payments in lieu of pension above, no pensions or 
payments in lieu of pensions are made. No benefits in kind 
are provided to any director.
Long term incentives - shares award table
Neither executive director currently participates in any long 
term incentive arrangement. In 2012 Josef El Raghy waived 
his outstanding share award as part of the restructuring of 
his remuneration package. He therefore has no outstanding 
award under any Company share arrangement. Josef 
El Raghy holds a substantial shareholding in the Company 
and this is deemed to be sufficient to create a union of 
interest between the executive and other shareholders. The 
awards held by Trevor Schultz under the EDLFSP did not 
meet the performance criteria and therefore at the date of 
this report neither executive director has any outstanding 
awards under any Company share scheme.

6. Long term incentive arrangements
Introduction
The Company has had a number of share schemes intended to facilitate employee and executive participation in the 
capital value of the Company. A number of these share schemes were developed to take account of Australian tax law. 
With the review last year and Committee concluding that the schemes were too complex and failed to provide any 
meaningful motivation or link to shareholder interests those scheme are no longer being used.
The existing executive directors no longer participate in any long term incentive arrangement and neither executive 
director has any outstanding award under any company share scheme.
There is a deferred share plan for senior management detailed below. 
Deferred Bonus Scheme (not for directors)
This plan, introduced in 2013, allows the annual bonus to be matched with shares which are then ordinarily released in 
three annual tranches, conditional upon the continued employment with the Group. The plan was introduced as a review of 
annual bonus arrangements for management with the objectives of:
(1) increasing the variable pay element of remuneration;
(2) introducing a new retention element in the remuneration package; and 
(3)  linking part of that reward to the medium term share performance of the Company.
For the initial year and to introduce the plan, on 4 June 2013, the Company offered to participants of existing plans the 
opportunity to replace awards with an initial one off award under the Deferred Bonus Share Plan.
The plan is not open to directors of the Company.  CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

6. Long term incentive arrangements continued
Historic long term incentive plan summary
Employee Loan Funded Share Plan 2011
There are no outstanding awards under this Plan and there is no current intention to make further awards under this plan. 
This was the rollover plan for the Centamin Egypt Ltd 2011 Employee Loan Funded Share Plan. Under the plan, employees 
receive a loan to buy shares in the Company. The shares are then held in trust for the employee and at the end of three 
years the employees can repay the loan and receive the shares. 
Director Loan Funded Share Plan 2011
After the year end, there were no outstanding awards under this Plan as the performance criteria were not met and awards 
lapsed. There is no current intention to use this Plan. The plan operated in the same way as the Employee Plan, except that 
there are mandatory performance conditions attached to the Director Plan, and that the shares vested in one tranche, three 
years from the date of grant. 
At 31 December 2013, having carried out initial calculations, the participants had no prospect of the performance 
conditions being met, however the plan operated in the following way. The awards were due to vest three years from the 
date of grant, dependent on the achievement of comparative total shareholder return, with 50% based upon the FTSE 250 
and 50% based upon comparator companies. 25% of the award would vest for median performance and 100% for upper 
quartile performance under each element. Comparator companies were selected by the Remuneration Committee from 
peers in the mining sector and were as follows: New Gold Inc; Centerra Gold Inc; Randgold Resources; Hochschild Mining; 
Alamos Gold Inc; European Goldfields Ltd; Eldorado Gold Corp; African Barrick Gold and Petropavlovsk Plc. 
Employee Share Option Plan
There are no outstanding awards under this plan and there is no current intention to use the plan. Awards under the plan 
were subject to performance criteria for senior management based upon share price, financial, production or key tasks.
