Directors' report on remuneration
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consisted of
Patrick Taylor (Chairman), Tom Scruby and
Colin Morrison (all Non-Executive Directors)
and together they considered all matters for the
period as reported below. No other party
materially assisted the Committee during the
period.
Directors' remuneration policy
The policy of the Group for the remuneration of
Executive Directors is that it should be
sufficient to attract and retain the Directors
needed to run the Company successfully. The
remuneration package consists of basic salary,
benefits, bonuses, pension and share options. 
It is the intention of the Committee to review at
least annually the remuneration packages
(including, but not limited to, pension
arrangements, the determination of any targets
for any performance-related pay schemes
operated by the Company - asking the Board,
when appropriate, to seek shareholder approval
for any long-term incentive arrangements,
bonuses, incentive payments and any
compensation payments and share option
entitlements) for each of the Executive Directors
and Company Secretary. The objective of such
policy being to ensure that such are provided
with appropriate remuneration and incentives to
encourage enhanced performance and are, in a
fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their
individual contributions to the success of the
Company.
The policy with regard to bonus schemes for
the Executive Directors and Company
Secretary is to set demanding performance
targets that are normally based on the
Company's key profit measure of Earnings per
share (formerly EBTA). The Earnings per share
target levels may be set with regard to a
number of factors, including year on year
growth. The maximum bonuses payable are
capped at 75% and 50% of annual salary for
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer respectively.
The Directors' service agreements
The contract date for Executive Directors'
existing service agreements is 27 February
2004 and provides for notice periods of 12
months; they do not have a fixed term of office. 
Patrick Taylor, Colin Morrison and Tom Scruby
are the Non-Executive Directors. The Non-
Executive Directors do not have service
contracts; they have a letter of appointment
with the Company. Their appointments are for
an initial three year period and provide for
notice period of one month. All retiring
Directors are eligible for re-election. Any Non-
Executive Director who has held office for a
nine year period or more shall be subject to 
re-election at each AGM.
Pension arrangements
There is no Group executive pension scheme.
The Company makes contributes to Directors'
individual pension schemes.
Share options
The Committee grants share options to members
of the senior management. Options granted
require that future corporate performance targets
be achieved before they can be exercised. The
same performance targets, which are based on
Earnings before taxation & amortisation (EBTA),
are common to all Executive Directors and senior
management. The Board's objective in granting
options is to increase shareholders value in
growth in earnings.
In determining the target EBTA, the base year's
profitability of Centaur Holdings plc and its
subsidiaries will be the financial year ended 30
June 2004. In respect of the year of exercise,
for the purposes of settling the adjusted
achieved EBTA the principal criteria to be
applied is:
a To exclude exceptional gains, losses or
other exceptional items;
b To exclude profits or losses arising from the
disposal of assets;
c To apply an appropriate and equitable
treatment to the recognition of profits or losses
arising from acquisitions within a maximum
period of two years from their purchase;
d That the EBTA will be expressed as an
amount per ordinary share for the time being
in issue in Centaur Holdings plc and where
the number of shares will be the weighted
average in issue throughout the relevant year
upon which the performance is based, and
e That the starting point for the number of
shares in issue is 147,994,118 being the total
number of ordinary shares of 10 pence in
each issue, fully paid, as at 10 March 2004
being the date of admission to the AIM.
The option plan is made up of two parts. Part I
is approved by the Inland Revenue and takes
advantage of the legislation to encourage
employees to own shares in the Company in a
tax efficient manner. Part II of the plan has not
been approved by the Inland Revenue.
The Rollover Plan 
Centaur Holdings plc Executive Directors and
certain senior employees elected to rollover
existing (old ) Centaur Communications Ltd
share options into new rollover  share options
in Centaur Holdings plc. The options were
exchanged for options each at various exercise
prices in Centaur Holdings plc. In addition, for
each share option held in Centaur
Communications Ltd, the employee (other than
Graham Sherren) received matching options in
Centaur Holdings plc. The exercise price for the
matching options is set equal to the market
value at date of listing, 10 March 2004.
Rollover option holders have been entitled to
exercise the former Centaur Communications
Ltd options which were rolled over from 10
March 2004 and are excluded from any
performance conditions.
