Directors' report on remuneration 
Information not subject to audit
The Directors' report on remuneration has been
prepared in accordance with the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consisted of
Patrick Taylor (Chairman), Tom Scruby, Colin
Morrison and Alton Irby (all Non-Executive
Directors) and together they considered all
matters for the period as reported below. 
During the year New Bridge Street Consultants
(NBSC) were appointed as remuneration
consultants to the Remuneration Committee.
NBSC advises the Committee directly on matters
within the Committee's terms of reference on
which the Committee chooses to consult NBSC.
NBSC advises the Board (or those Directors
charged by the Board to make
recommendations) from time to time on the
remuneration of Non-Executive Directors.
Directors' remuneration policy
The policy of the Group for the remuneration of
Executive Directors is that it should be sufficient
to attract and retain the Directors needed to run
the Group successfully.
In addition to the advice given by NBSC and in
order to assist in ascertaining the proper levels of
remuneration for Directors the Company Secretary
provides regular independent remuneration
research reference material to the Committee.
The remuneration package consists of basic
salary, benefits, bonuses, pension and share
options. It is the intention of the Committee to
review at least annually the remuneration
packages (including, but not limited to, pension
arrangements, the determination of any targets for
any performance-related pay schemes operated
by the Company - asking the Board, when
appropriate, to seek shareholder approval for any
longterm incentive arrangements, bonuses,
incentive payments and any compensation
payments and share option entitlements) for each
of the Executive Directors and Company secretary.
The objective of such policy being to ensure that
Directors are provided with appropriate
remuneration and incentives to encourage
enhanced performance and are, in a fair and
responsible manner, rewarded for their individual
contributions to the success of the Group.
The policy with regard to bonus schemes for the
Executive Directors and Company Secretary is to
set demanding but motivational performance targets
that are normally based on one of the Company's
key profit measures of Adjusted earnings per
share. The Adjusted earnings per share target
levels may be set with regard to a number of
factors, including year on year growth. The
maximum bonuses payable are capped at 75%
and 50% of annual salary for the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer respectively. 
At these levels of bonus the Committee consider
that there is a reasonable link between the
Executive Directors' remuneration and the
performance of the Group.
Non-Executive Directors receive a fee for their
services, and the reimbursement of incidental
expenses. In addition a payment of  1,500 per
working day is made in respect of any period
during which it is agreed by the Board that the time
commitment is significantly longer than envisaged
under the terms of the appointment as a result of,
for example, a major corporate transaction.
The Directors' service agreements
The contract date for Executive Directors' existing
service agreements is 27 February 2004. Notice
periods are 12 months and Executive Directors
do not have a fixed term of office. 
Their contracts provide for termination of their
employment within 14 days of which payment
shall be made in lieu of notice. Where the
Company terminates the contracts any damages
to which the Executive Director may be entitled
shall be calculated in accordance with ordinary
common law principles including those relating to
mitigation of loss.
Patrick Taylor, Colin Morrison, Tom Scruby and
Alton Irby are the Non-Executive Directors. The
Non-Executive Directors do not have service
contracts; they have a letter of appointment with
the Company. Their appointments are for an initial
three-year period and provide for a notice period
of one month. All retiring Directors are eligible for
re-election. Any Non-Executive Director who has
held office for a nine-year period or more shall be
subject to re-election at each AGM.
Their letters of appointment provide for
termination of Non-Executive Director's
employment with one month's notice.
Pension arrangements
There is no Group executive pension scheme.
The Group makes contributions to Directors'
individual pension schemes.
Long term incentive plans
The Group has four long term incentive
arrangements in place. Three of these plans (the
Long-term incentive plan, the Share option plan
and the Rollover plan) are available only to
Executive Directors and other key employees.
The Share incentive plan is open to all employees.
(i) Long term incentive plan
Following a review by the Remuneration Commit-
tee of the long-term incentive provision for Exec-
utive Directors and other key employees of the
Group, a resolution to replace the Share Option
plan with The Long-Term Incentive Plan 2006 (the
LTIP ) was approved at an Extraordinary General
Meeting of the Company on 4 May 2006, and
awards were made on 13 June 2006. 
The LTIP is intended to be the sole long-term
incentive arrangement for the Company's key
management, although in exceptional
circumstances further options may be granted
under the Share Option Plan. The Board believes
that the LTIP will provide a better link between
reward and performance and incentivise key
management to deliver long-term shareholder
value. 
Awards may be granted under the LTIP either as
a conditional allocation of ordinary shares in the
Company, a nil (or nominal) cost options with a
short exercise window or as forfeitable shares.
Awards will normally vest three years after,
subject to continuing employment and the
achievement of performance conditions. 
The maximum market value of shares over which
awards may be granted to any individuals in any
financial year will not exceed 100% of that
individual's base salary.
The initial awards on 13 June 2006 took the form
of conditional grants of free shares in the
Company. Vesting will be based on a condition
measuring the Company's Total Shareholder
Return (TSR ) against a comparator group of
companies over a fixed three year Performance
Period commencing on the first day of the
financial year in which the Award is granted. 
The TSR comparator group for the 2006 awards
is as follows:
 
EMAP plc
 
ITE plc
 
Reuters plc
 
Pearson plc
 
UBM plc
 
Reed Elsevier plc
 
Informa plc
 
Euromoney plc
 
Incisive Media Plc
 
Metal Bulletin plc
 
Wilmington Plc
 
Future Plc
 
Huveaux Plc
Centaur Media plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 32
Directors' report on remuneration 
Centaur Media plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006
Irrespective of the Company's TSR performance,
no award will vest unless the Committee is
satisfied that this is warranted by the financial
performance of the Company since grant, with
average growth in the Company's adjusted
Earnings per share of RPI plus 2% considered a
minimum level of financial performance, unless
the Committee considers that it would be
inappropriate to apply this underpin .
(ii) Share option plan
The Committee has previously granted share op-
tions under the Share option plan to members of
senior management. The Board's objective in
granting options was to increase shareholders
value in growth in earnings.
Options granted have a three year vesting period
and require that future corporate performance
targets be achieved before they can be exercised.
The same performance targets, which are based
on Earnings before taxation & amortisation
(EBTA), are common to all Executive Directors
and senior management. In order to determine
the number of shares that optionholders will be
entitled to acquire on exercise of their options,
EBTA per Ordinary Share is required to grow at a
series of compound rates of growth between 19
and 44 per cent over a three-year performance
period, or 26 and 63 per cent over a four-year
performance period.
In determining the target EBTA, the base year's
profitability of Centaur Media plc and its
subsidiaries will be the financial year ended 30
June 2004. In respect of the year of exercise, for
the purposes of settling the adjusted achieved
EBTA the principal criteria to be applied is:
(a) To exclude exceptional gains, losses or
other exceptional items,
(b) To exclude profits or losses arising from the
disposal of assets,
(c) To apply an appropriate and equitable
treatment to the recognition of profits or
losses arising from acquisitions within a
maximum period of two years from their
purchase,
(d) That the EBTA will be expressed as an
amount per ordinary share for the time being
in issue in Centaur Media plc and where the
number of shares will be the weighted
average in issue throughout the relevant year
upon which the performance is based, 
(e) That the starting point for the number of
shares in issue is 147,994,118 being the total
number of ordinary shares of 10 pence each
is issue, fully paid, as at 10 March 2004 being
the date of admission to the AIM.
The option plan is made up of two parts. Part I is
approved by the Inland Revenue and takes
advantage of the legislation to encourage
employees to own shares in the Company in a
tax efficient manner. Part II of the plan has not
been approved by the Inland Revenue.
There is a limit on the grant of options under the
Share Option Schemes. Options may not be
granted if the numbers of Ordinary Shares over
which they are granted (together with any
Ordinary Shares which are subject to options
granted pursuant to the Rollover Plan) exceed 5
per cent of the Ordinary Shares in issue
immediately prior to the date of grant of the
options.
(iii) The Rollover plan 
Centaur Media plc Executive Directors and
certain senior employees elected to rollover
existing (old ) Centaur Communications Ltd
share options into new rollover  share options in
Centaur Media plc. The options were exchanged
for options each at various exercise prices in
Centaur Media plc. In addition, for each share
option held in Centaur Communications Ltd, the
employees (other than Graham Sherren) received
matching options in Centaur Media plc. The
exercise price for the matching options is set
equal to the market value at date of listing, 10
March 2004.
Rollover option holders have been entitled to
exercise the former Centaur Communications Ltd
options from 10 March 2004 and are excluded
from any performance conditions.

(iv) Share incentive plan
During the year, the Company introduced a Share
Incentive Plan. The scheme is open to all
employees who have been employed by the
Group for more than 12 months. Employees may
invest up to  1,500 per annum (or 10% of their
salary if less) in shares in the Company which are
held in trust and can be withdrawn with tax paid
at any time, or tax-free after five years. Other than
continuing employment, there are no other
performance conditions attached to the plan.
The Executive Directors are eligible to participate
in the Share Incentive Plan.
