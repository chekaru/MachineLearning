  
Directors' Report on Remuneration
 
Information Not Subject to Audit
 
The Directors' report on remuneration has been 
prepared in accordance with the Directors' 
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. 
The Remuneration Committee 
Details of the Remuneration Committee are found 
on page 42. 
Directors' remuneration policy 
The policy of the Group for the remuneration of 
Executive Directors is that it should be sufficient to 
attract and retain the Directors needed to run the 
Group successfully. 
In addition to the advice given by NBSC and in 
order to assist in ascertaining the proper levels of 
remuneration for Directors the Company Secretary 
provides regular independent remuneration 
research reference material to the Committee. 
Centaur's primary focus is on organic, profitable 
growth. Its key strategic objectives include a 
target of double digit revenue growth across the 
cycle and an increase in adjusted EBITDA margins 
to 25%. In light of this, the Remuneration 
Committee considers it important that a significant 
proportion of the Executive Directors' 
remuneration packages should be linked to 
growth in profits and shareholder value. 
The remuneration package consists of basic 
salary, benefits, bonuses, pension and share 
options. It is the intention of the Committee to 
review at least annually the remuneration 
packages (including, but not limited to, pension 
arrangements, the determination of any targets 
for any performance-related pay schemes 
operated by the Company - asking the Board, 
when appropriate, to seek shareholder approval 
for any long-term incentive arrangements, 
bonuses, incentive payments and any 
compensation payments and share option 
entitlements) for each of the Executive Directors 
and Company Secretary. The objective of such 
policy being to ensure that Directors are provided 
with appropriate remuneration and incentives to 
encourage enhanced performance and are, in 
a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for 
their individual contributions to the success 
of the Group. 
The policy with regard to bonus schemes for the 
Executive Directors and Company Secretary is to 
set demanding but motivational performance 
targets that are normally based on one of the 
Company's key profit measures of Adjusted 
earnings per share. The Adjusted earnings per 
share target levels may be set with regard to a 
number of factors, including year on year growth. 
The maximum bonuses payable in respect of the 
year to 30 June 2008 are capped at 75%, 75% 
and 40% of annual salary for the Chairman, Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO) and Group Finance 
Director (GFD) respectively. The Chairman's bonus 
in respect of that year is based on his salary at 
30 June 2007, but the amount payable will be 5.2 
/ 12 of the calculated figure to reflect the fact that 
on 6 December 2007 he becomes a Non-
Executive Chairman. 
Bonuses payable to the Chairman, CEO and GFD 
in respect of the year amounted to 57.5%, 57.5% 
and 31.3% of their salaries at 30 June 2007 i.e. 
just over 75% of the maximum bonus limit. These 
were calculated by reference to growth in 
Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) for the year. 
Adjusted EPS of less than 7.0p (implying growth 
of up to 13%) would have resulted in no bonus 
being paid. Maximum bonus would have been 
paid for achieving Adjusted EPS of 8.8p, 
representing growth of 42%. Actual Adjusted EPS 
achieved of 8.2p represented growth of 32%. 
Details of the Company's long-term incentive 
plans (LTIP) are outlined below. During the year, 
LTIP awards granted to the CEO and GFD of 
85,000 shares and 30,000 shares respectively 
were valued at the time of grant at 51% and 30% 
of their respective salaries compared with the 
100% maximum limit set in the plan approved 
by shareholders. 
At these levels of bonus the Committee consider 
that there is a reasonable link between the 
Executive Directors' remuneration and the 
performance of the Group. 
The Non-Executive Directors receive a fee for 
their services, and the reimbursement of 
incidental expenses. In addition a payment of 
 1,500 per working day is made in respect 
of any period during which it is agreed by the 
Board that the time commitment is significantly 
longer than envisaged under the terms of the 
appointment as a result of, for example, a major 
corporate transaction. 
Alton Irby has waived his fees from 1 January 
2007, however, the Group pays his travel and 
accommodation expenses in the UK when he 
travels from the United States of America to 
attend Board and Committee meetings. 
The Directors' service agreements 
The contract date for Executive Directors' existing 
service agreements is 27 February 2004, with the 
exception of Michael Lally whose present 
agreement is dated 2 April 2007. Notice periods 
are 12 months and Executive Directors do not 
have a fixed term of office.

Their contracts provide for termination of their 
employment within 14 days of which payment 
shall be made in lieu of notice. Where the 
Company terminates the contracts any damages 
to which the Executive Director may be entitled 
shall be calculated in accordance with ordinary 
common law principles including those relating to 
mitigation of loss. 
Patrick Taylor, Colin Morrison, Tom Scruby, Alton 
Irby and Colin Satterthwaite (appointed 1 July 
2007) are the Non-Executive Directors. The Non-
Executive Directors do not have service contracts; 
they have a letter of appointment with the 
Company. Their appointments are for an initial 
three-year period and provide for a notice period 
of one month. All retiring Directors are eligible for 
re-election. Any Non-Executive Director who has 
held office for a nine-year period or more shall be 
subject to re-election at each AGM. 
Their letters of appointment provide for termination 
of Non-Executive Director's employment with one 
month's notice. 
Pension arrangements 
There is no Group executive pension scheme. 
The Group makes contributions to Executive 
Directors' individual pension schemes; 17.5% 
of salary for Geoffrey Wilmot and 9% of salary for 
Michael Lally. The Group makes contributions 
of between 3% and 9% of salary for other 
employees, dependent on their seniority. 
Long-term incentive plans 
The Group has four long-term incentive 
arrangements in place. Three of these plans 
(the Long-term incentive plan, the Share option 
plan and the Rollover plan) are available only to 
Executive Directors and other key employees. 
The Share incentive plan is open to all employees. 
(i) Long-term incentive plan (LTIP ) 
The LTIP is intended to be the sole long-term 
incentive arrangement for the Company's key 
management, although in exceptional 
circumstances further options may be granted 
under the Share Option Plan. The Board believes 
that the LTIP will provide a better link between 
reward and performance and incentivise key 
management to deliver long-term shareholder value. 
Awards may be granted under the LTIP either as a 
conditional allocation of ordinary shares in the 
Company, as nil (or nominal) cost options with a 
short exercise window or as forfeitable shares. 
Awards will normally vest three years after grant, 
subject to continuing employment and the 
achievement of performance conditions. 
The maximum market value of shares over which 
awards may be granted to any individuals in any 
financial year will not exceed 100% of that 
individual's base salary. 
The awards made in 2006 and 2007 took the 
form of conditional grants of free shares in the 
Company. Vesting will be based on a condition 
measuring the Company's Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR ) against a comparator group of 
companies over a fixed three year Performance 
Period commencing on the first day of the 
financial year in which the award is granted. 
The TSR comparator group for the 2007 
awards is as follows: 
  EMAP plc   Pearson plc 
  Euromoney plc   Reed Elsevier plc 
  Future Plc   Reuters plc 
  Huveaux Plc   UBM plc 
  Informa plc   Wilmington Plc 
  ITE plc 
The TSR comparator group for the 2006 Awards 
included Metal Bulletin and Incisive Media, both of 
which have been de-listed. The percentage of 
an award that will vest is as follows: 
Ranking of the Company's 
TSR when compared Percentage of 
against the TSR of the Award that 
comparator companies Vests 
Below median 0% 
Median 30% 
Upper quartile 100% 
Between median and Straight-line vesting 
upper quartile between 30% and 
100% based on 
ranking plus interpolation 
between rankings 
Irrespective of the Company's TSR performance, 
no award will vest unless the Remuneration 
Committee is satisfied that this is warranted by the 
financial performance of the Company since grant, 
with average growth in the Company's adjusted 
Earnings per share of RPI plus 2% considered a 
minimum level of financial performance, unless the 
Remuneration Committee considers that it would 
be inappropriate to apply this underpin . 
(ii) Share option plan 
The Committee has previously granted share 
options under the Share option plan to members 
of senior management. The Board's objective in 
granting options was to increase shareholder 
value through growth in earnings. 
Options granted have a three year vesting period 
and require that future corporate performance 
targets be achieved before they can be exercised. 
The same performance targets, which are based 
on Earnings before taxation and amortisation 
(EBTA), are common to all Executive Directors 
and Senior Management. In order to determine 
the number of shares that optionholders will be 
entitled to acquire on exercise of their options, 
EBTA per Ordinary Share is required to grow at a 
series of compound rates of growth between 19 
and 44 per cent over a three-year performance 
period, or 26 and 63 per cent over a four-year 
performance period. 
In determining the target EBTA, the base year's 
profitability of Centaur Media plc and its 
subsidiaries will be the financial year ended 30 
June 2004. In respect of the year of exercise, for 
the purposes of settling the adjusted achieved 
EBTA the principal criteria to be applied is: 
(a) To exclude exceptional gains, losses or other 
exceptional items. 
(b) To exclude profits or losses arising from the 
disposal of assets. 
(c) To apply an appropriate and equitable 
treatment to the recognition of profits or losses 
arising from acquisitions within a maximum period 
of two years from their purchase. 
(d) That the EBTA will be expressed as an amount 
per ordinary share for the time being in issue in 
Centaur Media plc and where the number of 
shares will be the weighted average in issue 
throughout the relevant year upon which the 
performance is based. 
(e) That the starting point for the number of 
shares in issue is 147,994,118 being the total 
number of ordinary shares of 10 pence each is 
issue, fully paid, as at 10 March 2004 being the 
date of admission to the AIM. 
The option plan is made up of two parts. Part I is 
approved by the Inland Revenue and takes 
advantage of the legislation to encourage 
employees to own shares in the Company in a tax 
efficient manner. Part II of the plan has not been 
approved by the Inland Revenue.

There is a limit on the grant of options under the 
Share Option Schemes. Options may not be 
granted if the numbers of Ordinary Shares over 
which they are granted (together with any Ordinary 
Shares which are subject to options granted 
pursuant to the Rollover Plan) exceed 5 per cent 
of the Ordinary Shares in issue immediately prior to 
the date of grant of the options. 
(iii) The Rollover plan 
Centaur Media plc Executive Directors and certain 
senior employees elected to rollover existing 
(old ) Centaur Communications Ltd share options 
into new rollover  share options in Centaur Media 
plc. The options were exchanged for options each 
at various exercise prices in Centaur Media plc. 
Rollover option holders have been entitled to 
exercise the former Centaur Communications Ltd 
options from 10 March 2005 and are excluded 
from any performance conditions. 
(iv) Share incentive plan 
During the previous year, the Company introduced 
a Share Incentive Plan. The scheme is open to all 
employees who have been employed by the 
Group for more than 12 months. Employees may 
invest up to  1,500 per annum (or 10% of their 
salary if less) in shares in the Company which are 
held in trust and can be withdrawn with tax paid 
at any time, or tax-free after five years. Other than 
continuing employment, there are no other 
performance conditions attached to the plan. 
The Executive Directors are eligible to participate 
in the Share Incentive Plan.
