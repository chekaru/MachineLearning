 DIRECTORS' REPORT ON REMUNERATION
Centaur Media plc - Annual Report
Year ended 30 June 2008 40
The Directors' report on remuneration has been
prepared in accordance with the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The Remuneration Committee
Details of the Remuneration Committee are found
on page 38.
Directors' remuneration policy
The policy of the Group for the remuneration of
Executive Directors is that it should be sufficient
to attract and retain the Directors needed to run
the Group successfully.
In addition to the advice given by HNBSC and in
order to assist in ascertaining the proper levels of
remuneration for Directors the Company Secretary
provides regular independent remuneration
research reference material to the Committee.
Centaur's primary focus is on organic, profitable
growth. Its key strategic objectives include a
target of double digit revenue growth across the
cycle and an increase in adjusted EBITDA margins
to 25%. In light of this, the Remuneration
Committee considers it important that a significant
proportion of the Executive Directors'
remuneration packages should be linked to
growth in profits and shareholder value. 
The remuneration package consists of basic
salary, benefits, bonuses, pension and share
options. It is the intention of the Committee to
review at least annually the remuneration
packages (including, but not limited to, pension
arrangements, the determination of any targets for
any performance-related pay schemes operated
by the Company - asking the Board, when
appropriate, to seek shareholder approval for any
long term incentive arrangements, bonuses,
incentive payments and any compensation
payments and share option entitlements) for each
of the Executive Directors and Company
Secretary. The objective of such policy being to
ensure that Directors are provided with appropriate
remuneration and incentives to encourage
enhanced performance and are, in a fair and
responsible manner, rewarded for their individual
contributions to the success of the Group.
The policy with regard to bonus schemes for the
Executive Directors and Company Secretary is to
set demanding but motivational performance
targets that are normally based on one of the
Company's key profit measures of Adjusted
earnings per share. The Adjusted earnings per
share target levels may be set with regard to a
number of factors, including year on year growth.
The maximum bonuses payable in respect of the
year to 30 June 2009 are capped at 100% and
50% of annual salary for the Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) and Group Finance Director (GFD)
respectively, with a higher growth target set for
the CEO than the GFD. 
Bonuses payable to the CEO and GFD in respect
of the year amounted to 15.6% and 8.0% of their
salaries respectively at 30 June 2008. The
Chairman's bonus in respect of the year was
15.6% of his salary for the period 1 July 2007 to 6
December 2007 at which point he became a
Non-Executive Chairman. These were calculated
by reference to growth in Adjusted earnings per
share (EPS) for the year. Adjusted EPS of less
than 8.6p (implying growth of up to 10.3%) would
have resulted in no bonus being paid. Maximum
bonus would have been paid for achieving
Adjusted EPS of 10.9p, representing growth of
40%. Actual Adjusted EPS achieved of 9.2p
represented growth of 12%. 
Details of the Company's long-term incentive
plans (LTIP) are outlined below. During the year,
LTIP awards granted to the CEO and GFD of
300,000 shares and 120,000 shares respectively
were valued at the time of grant at 92.8% and
62.0% of their respective salaries compared with
the 100% maximum limit set in the plan approved
by shareholders.
At these levels of bonus the Committee consider
that there is a reasonable link between the
Executive Directors' remuneration and the
performance of the Group.
The Non-Executive Directors receive a fee for 
their services, and the reimbursement of 
incidental expenses. In addition a payment of
 1,500 per working day is made in respect of 
any period during which it is agreed by the Board
that the time commitment is significantly longer
than envisaged under the terms of the
appointment as a result of, for example, a major
corporate transaction. 
The Directors' service agreements
Geoffrey Wilmot's service agreement is dated 27
February 2004, amended on 23 November 2006
to reflect his appointment as Chief Executive
Officer, and Michael Lally's agreement is dated 
2 April 2007. Notice periods are 12 months 
and Executive Directors do not have a fixed term
of office. 
Their contracts provide for termination of their
employment within 14 days of which payment
shall be made in lieu of notice. Where the
Company terminates the contracts any damages
to which the Executive Director may be entitled
shall be calculated in accordance with ordinary
common law principles including those relating to
mitigation of loss.
Graham Sherren is the Non- Executive Chairman.
His service contract has been amended to reflect
his status as a Non-Executive and continues to
provide for a notice period of twelve months.
Patrick Taylor, Colin Morrison, Tom Scruby and
Colin Satterthwaite are the Non-Executive
Directors. The Non-Executive Directors do not
have service contracts; they have a letter of
appointment with the Company. Their
appointments are for an initial three-year period
and provide for a notice period of one month. 
All retiring Directors are eligible for re-election. 
Any Non-Executive Director who has held office
for a nine-year period or more shall be subject 
to re-election at each AGM. Their letters of
appointment provide for termination of 
Non-Executive Director's employment with one
month's notice.

Year ended 30 June 2008 41
Pension arrangements
There is no Group executive pension scheme. 
The Group makes contributions to Executive
Directors' individual pension schemes; 17.5% 
of salary for Geoffrey Wilmot and 9% of salary 
for Michael Lally. The Group makes contributions
of between 3% and 9% of salary for other
employees, dependent on their seniority.
Long-term incentive plans
The Group has five long-term incentive
arrangements in place. Three of these plans 
(the Long-term incentive plan, the Share option
plan and the Rollover plan) are available only to
Executive Directors and other key employees. 
The Share incentive and Sharesave plans are
open to all employees.
(i) Long-term incentive plan (LTIP )
The LTIP is intended to be the sole long-term
incentive arrangement for the Company's key
management, although in exceptional
circumstances further options may be granted
under the Share option plan. The Board believes
that the LTIP will provide a better link between
reward and performance and incentivise key
management to deliver long-term shareholder
value. The maximum market value of shares over
which awards may be granted to any individuals
in any financial year will not exceed 100% of that
individual's base salary.
Awards may be granted under the LTIP either as a
conditional allocation of ordinary shares in the
Company, as nil (or nominal) cost options with a
short exercise window or as forfeitable shares.
Awards will normally vest three years after grant,
subject to continuing employment and the
achievement of performance conditions. All
awards made under this plan take the form of
conditional grants of free shares in the Company.
Vesting is based on a condition measuring the
Company's Total Shareholder Return (TSR )
against a comparator group of companies over a
fixed three year Performance Period commencing
on the first day of the financial year in which the
award is granted (save for the three year
performance period applying to the initial awards
which commenced on the date of grant). TSR is
the increase in the Net Return Index (as
calculated by a specific financial information
provider as selected by the Committee) for each
company over the Performance Period, calculated
as the increase in the average Net Return Index
during the last three month period of the
Performance Period compared to the average Net
Return Index during the three month period
ending on the day before the start of the
Performance Period.
The comparator group for the 2008 awards was
as follows:
  Euromoney plc   Pearson plc
  Future Plc   Reed Elsevier plc
  Huveaux Plc   Trinity Mirror plc
  Informa plc   UBM plc
  ITE plc   Wilmington Plc
  Johnston Press plc   Yell Group Plc
  Mecom Group Plc
Since the grant of the 2006 awards, four
companies (namely EMAP, Reuters, Metal Bulletin
and Incisive Media) that were included in the
original comparator group have been de-listed.
Two of these companies (namely EMAP and
Reuters) also formed part of the 2007 comparator
group. For consistency, and to maintain a
sufficient number of comparator companies in
these groups, Johnston Press plc, Mecom Group
Plc, Trinity Mirror plc and Yell Group Plc have
been added to these comparator groups. 
The percentage of an award that will vest is 
as follows:
Irrespective of the Company's TSR performance,
no award will vest unless the Remuneration
Committee is satisfied that this is warranted by
the financial performance of the Company since
grant, with average growth in the Company's
adjusted Earnings per share of RPI plus 2%
considered a minimum level of financial
performance, unless the Remuneration Committee
considers that it would be inappropriate to apply
this underpin.

(ii) Share option plan
The Committee has previously granted share
options under the Share option plan to members
of senior management. The Board's objective in
granting options was to increase shareholder
value through growth in earnings.
Options granted have a three year vesting period
and require that future corporate performance
targets be achieved before they can be exercised.
The same performance targets, which are based
on Earnings before taxation & amortisation
(EBTA), are common to all Executive Directors 
and senior management. In order to determine
the number of shares that option-holders will be
entitled to acquire on exercise of their options,
EBTA per ordinary share is required to grow at a
series of compound rates of growth between 19
and 44 per cent over a three-year performance
period, or 26 and 63 per cent over a four-year
performance period.
In determining the target EBTA, the base year's
profitability of Centaur Media plc and its
subsidiaries will be the financial year ended 30
June 2004. In respect of the year of exercise, for
the purposes of settling the adjusted achieved
EBTA the principal criteria to be applied is:
(a) To exclude exceptional gains, losses or other
exceptional items.
(b) To exclude profits or losses arising from the
disposal of assets.
(c) To apply an appropriate and equitable
treatment to the recognition of profits or losses
arising from acquisitions within a maximum period
of two years from their purchase.
(d) That the EBTA will be expressed as an 
amount per ordinary share for the time being in
issue in Centaur Media plc and where the number
of shares will be the weighted average in issue
throughout the relevant year upon which the
performance is based.
(e) That the starting point for the number of
shares in issue is 147,994,118 being the total
number of ordinary shares of 10 pence each is
issue, fully paid, as at 10 March 2004 being the
date of admission to the AIM.
The option plan is made up of two parts. Part I is
approved by the Inland Revenue and takes
advantage of the legislation to encourage
employees to own shares in the Company in a tax
efficient manner. Part II of the plan has not been
approved by the Inland Revenue.
There is a limit on the grant of options under the
Share Option Schemes. Options may not be
granted if the numbers of ordinary shares over
which they are granted (together with any ordinary
shares which are subject to options granted
pursuant to the Rollover Plan) exceed 5 per cent
of the ordinary shares in issue immediately prior to
the date of grant of the options.
(iii) Rollover plan 
Centaur Media plc Executive Directors and certain
senior employees elected to rollover existing
(old ) Centaur Communications Ltd share options
into new rollover  share options in Centaur Media
plc. The options were exchanged for options each
at various exercise prices in Centaur Media plc.
Rollover option holders have been entitled to
exercise the former Centaur Communications Ltd
options from 10 March 2005 and are excluded
from any performance conditions.
(iv) Share incentive plan
The Share Incentive Plan is open to all employees
who have been employed by the Group for more
than 12 months. Employees may invest up to
 1,500 per annum (or 10% of their salary if less)
in shares in the Company which are held in trust
and can be withdrawn with tax paid at any time,
or tax-free after five years. Other than continuing
employment, there are no other performance
conditions attached to the plan.
The Executive Directors are eligible to participate
in the Share incentive plan 
(v) Sharesave plan
During the year, the Company introduced a
Sharesave plan (the 'SAYE Scheme'). The SAYE
Scheme is an HMRC approved all-employee plan
and is open to all employees who have been
employed by the Group for more than 12 months.
Employees may invest up to  3,000 per annum
for a period of either 3 or 5 years, after which they
may exercise SAYE options within 6 months of the
anniversary date of the contract commencement
date. The Option price of the 2008 grants made
was 64.7 pence, a discount of 20% on the share
price determined at the pricing date. Other than
continuing employment, there are no other
performance conditions attached to the plan.
The Executive Directors are eligible to participate
in the Sharesave Plan.  DIRECTORS' REPORT ON REMUNERATION
