 DIRECTORS' REPORT ON REMUNERATION 
INFORMATION NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT
46 Centaur Media plc - Annual Report 
Year ended 30 June 2009
The Directors' report on remuneration has been
prepared in accordance with SI 2008/410 of the
Companies Act 2006.
The Remuneration Committee
Details of the Remuneration Committee are
found on page 44.
Directors' remuneration policy
The policy of the Group for the remuneration
of Executive Directors is that it should be
sufficient to attract and retain the Directors
needed to run the Group successfully.
In addition to the advice given by HNBSC
and in order to assist in ascertaining the
proper levels of remuneration for Directors
the Company Secretary provides regular
independent remuneration research
reference material to the Committee.
Centaur's primary focus is on organic,
profitable growth. Its key strategic
objectives include a target of long term
double digit revenue growth and an
increase in adjusted EBITDA margins to
25%. In light of this, the Remuneration
Committee considers it important that a
significant proportion of the Executive
Directors' remuneration packages should
be linked to growth in profits and
shareholder value.
The remuneration package consists of 
basic salary, benefits, bonuses, pension
and share options. It is the intention of 
the Committee to review at least annually
the remuneration packages (including, 
but not limited to, pension arrangements,
the determination of any targets for any
performance-related pay schemes operated
by the Company - asking the Board, when
appropriate, to seek shareholder approval
for any long term incentive arrangements,
bonuses, incentive payments and any
compensation payments and share option
entitlements) for each of the Executive
Directors and Company Secretary. The
objective of such policy being to ensure 
that Directors are provided with appropriate
remuneration and incentives to encourage
enhanced performance and are, in a fair
and responsible manner, rewarded for their
individual contributions to the success of
the Group.
The policy with regard to bonus schemes 
for the Executive Directors and Company
Secretary is to set demanding but
motivational performance targets that are
normally based on one of the Company's
key profit measures of adjusted earnings
per share. The adjusted earnings per share
target levels may be set with regard to a
number of factors, including year on year
growth. The maximum bonuses payable 
in respect of the year to 30 June 2010 are
capped at 100% and 50% of annual salary
for the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and
Group Finance Director (GFD) respectively,
with a higher growth target set for the CEO
than the GFD.
There were no bonuses payable to the CEO
or the GFD in respect of the year as EPS
growth targets, on which the entitlement 
to bonuses were calculated, were not met.
They were calculated by reference to growth
in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) for the
year. Adjusted EPS of less than 6.3p would
have resulted in no bonus being paid.
Maximum bonus would have been paid for
achieving adjusted EPS of 7.7p. Actual
adjusted EPS achieved was 2.1 p.
Details of the Company's long-term
incentive plans (LTIP) are outlined below.
During the year, share options were granted
to the Chief Executive Officer and Group
Finance Director as detailed on pages 50
and 51.
At these levels of bonus the Committee
consider that there is a reasonable link
between the Executive Directors'
remuneration and the performance of 
the Group.
The Committee has exercised its discretion
with regard to certain long-term incentive
awards granted to four senior members 
of management whose roles were made
redundant in 2008. In all these cases the
exercise period for their unapproved share
options was extended from six to twelve
months and it was agreed that their LTIP
awards would vest on the normal dates
without being scaled-down. At 30 June
2009 the revised exercise period had
expired for three of the four individuals 
and none of the LTIP's awarded will vest.
The revised option exercise period for the
remaining individual will expire in
September 2009.
The Non-Executive Directors receive a fee
for their services, and the reimbursement of
incidental expenses. In addition a payment
of  1,500 per working day is made in
respect of any period during which it 
is agreed by the Board that the time
commitment is significantly longer than
envisaged under the terms of the
appointment as a result of, for example, 
a major corporate transaction. 
The Directors' service agreements
Geoffrey Wilmot's service agreement is
dated 27 February 2004, amended on 23
November 2006 to reflect his appointment
as Chief Executive Officer, and Michael
Lally's agreement is dated 2 April 2007.
Notice periods are 12 months and Executive
Directors do not have a fixed term of office. 
Their contracts provide for termination of
their employment within 14 days of which
payment shall be made in lieu of notice.
Where the Company terminates the
contracts any damages to which the
Executive Director may be entitled shall 
be calculated in accordance with ordinary
common law principles including those
relating to mitigation of loss.
Graham Sherren is the Non- Executive
Chairman. His service contract has been
amended to reflect his status as a Non-
Executive and continues to provide for 
a notice period of twelve months.
Patrick Taylor, Colin Morrison, Tom 
Scruby and Colin Satterthwaite are the 
Non-Executive Directors. The Non-Executive
Directors do not have service contracts;
they have a letter of appointment with the
Company. Their appointments are for an DIRECTORS' REPORT ON REMUNERATION

Year ended 30 June 2009
initial three-year period and provide for 
a notice period of one month. All retiring
Directors are eligible for re-election. Any
Non-Executive Director who has held office
for a nine-year period or more shall be
subject to re-election at each AGM. 
Their letters of appointment provide for
termination of Non-Executive Director's
employment with one month's notice.
Pension arrangements
There is no Group executive pension
scheme. The Group makes contributions 
to Executive Directors' individual pension
schemes; 17.5% of salary for Geoffrey
Wilmot and 9% of salary for Michael Lally.
The Group makes contributions of between
3% and 9% of salary for other employees,
dependent on their seniority.
Long-term incentive plans
The Group has four long-term incentive
arrangements in place. Three of these 
plans (the Long-term incentive plan, the
Share option plan and the Rollover plan)
are available only to Executive Directors
and other key employees. The Share
incentive and Sharesave plans are open 
to all employees.
It is intended that the awards will be funded
from the employee benefit trust and shares
held in treasury.
(i) Long-term incentive plan (LTIP )
The LTIP is intended to be the sole long-term
incentive arrangement for the Company's
key management, although in exceptional
circumstances further options may be
granted under the Share option plan. The
Board believes that the LTIP will provide a
better link between reward and performance
and incentivise key management to deliver
long-term shareholder value. 
However, it was decided by the
Remuneration Committee in October 
2008 to grant further share options to
certain Directors and key members of
management. In considering the grant the
Committee noted that in the Notice of the
EGM at which the LTIP was approved it
stated that The Remuneration Committee
believes that the existing ESOP should be
replaced with a new LTIP  and that only in
exceptional circumstances (such as the
recruitment of a senior executive) further
options may be granted under the ESOP .
The Committee, however, was of the opinion
that the current lack of value in the LTIP 
and the disincentive that this created
constituted exceptional circumstances 
and thus further options should be granted
under the ESOP . Details of these grants 
are found at page 50.
The maximum market value of shares 
over which awards may be granted to any
individuals in any financial year will not
exceed 100% of that individual's base
salary. Awards may be granted under the
LTIP either as a conditional allocation of
ordinary shares in the Company, as nil (or
nominal) cost options with a short exercise
window or as forfeitable shares. Awards 
will normally vest three years after grant,
subject to continuing employment and the
achievement of performance conditions. 
All awards made under this plan take the
form of conditional grants of free shares 
in the Company. Vesting is based on a
condition measuring the Company's 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR ) against 
a comparator group of companies over 
a fixed three year Performance Period
commencing on the first day of the financial
year in which the award is granted (save for
the three year performance period applying
to the initial awards which commenced on
the date of grant). 
TSR is the increase in the Net Return Index
(as calculated by a specific financial
information provider as selected by the
Committee) for each company over the
Performance Period, calculated as the
increase in the average Net Return Index
during the last three month period of the
Performance Period compared to the
average Net Return Index during the three
month period ending on the day before 
the start of the Performance Period.
The comparator group for the LTIP awards
was as follows:
  Euromoney plc
  Future Plc
  Huveaux Plc
  Informa plc
  ITE plc
  Johnston Press plc
  Mecom Group Plc
  Pearson plc
  Reed Elsevier plc
  Trinity Mirror plc
  UBM plc
  Wilmington Plc
  Yell Group Plc
Irrespective of the Company's TSR
performance, no award will vest unless 
the Remuneration Committee is satisfied
that this is warranted by the financial
performance of the Company since grant,
with average growth in the Company's
adjusted Earnings per share of RPI plus 2%
considered a minimum level of financial
performance, unless the Remuneration
Committee considers that it would be
inappropriate to apply this underpin.  
The performance period for the 2006
awards ended on 12 June 2009, and for the
2007 awards ended on 30 June 2009. The
Company's TSR was below median for both
of these periods and therefore none of the
shares subject to these awards will vest. 
Below median 0%
Median 30%
Upper quartile 100%
Between median and upper quartile Straight-line vesting between 30% 
and 100% based on ranking plus
interpolation between rankings

(ii) Share option plan
The Committee granted share options under
Part II of the plan to Directors and members
of senior management in October 2008. 
The options granted will be exercisable
upon the achievement of certain adjusted
EPS targets in respect of the financial year
ending 30 June 2012.
The Committee has previously granted
share options under the Share option plan
to members of senior management. The
Board's objective in granting options was to
increase shareholder value through growth
in earnings. All these options can now be
exercised as the corporate performance
targets relating to them have been met.
Details of these targets were set out in 
the 2008 Report.
The option plan is made up of two parts.
Part I is approved by the Inland Revenue
and takes advantage of the legislation to
encourage employees to own shares in the
Company in a tax efficient manner. Part II of
the plan has not been approved by the
Inland Revenue.
There is a limit on the grant of options
under the Share Option Schemes. Options
may not be granted if the numbers of
ordinary shares over which they are granted
(together with any ordinary shares which
are subject to options granted pursuant to
the Rollover Plan) exceed 5 per cent of the
ordinary shares in issue immediately prior
to the date of grant of the options.
(iii) Rollover plan 
Centaur Media plc Executive Directors and
certain senior employees elected to rollover
existing (old ) Centaur Communications
Ltd share options into new rollover  share
options in Centaur Media plc. The options
were exchanged for options each at various
exercise prices in Centaur Media plc.
Rollover option holders have been 
entitled to exercise the former Centaur
Communications Ltd options from 10 
March 2005 and are excluded from any
performance conditions.
(iv) Share incentive plan
The Share incentive plan is open to all
employees who have been employed by the
Group for more than 12 months. Employees
may invest up to  1,500 per annum (or
10% of their salary if less) in shares in the
Company which are held in trust and can 
be withdrawn with tax paid at any time, 
or tax-free after five years. Other than
continuing employment, there are no 
other performance conditions attached 
to the plan. 
The Executive Directors are eligible to
participate in the Share incentive plan. 
(v) Sharesave plan
The Company has a Sharesave plan 
(the 'SAYE Scheme'). The SAYE Scheme 
is an HMRC approved all-employee plan 
and is open to all employees who have
been employed by the Group for more than
12 months. Employees may invest up to
 3,000 per annum for a period of either 
3 or 5 years, after which they may exercise
SAYE options within 6 months of the
anniversary date of the contract
commencement date. The Option price 
of the 2009 grants made was 20.92p, 
a discount of 20% on the share price
determined at the pricing date. Other 
than continuing employment, there are 
no other performance conditions attached
to the plan.
The Executive Directors are eligible to
participate in the Sharesave plan.  DIRECTORS' REPORT ON REMUNERATION
