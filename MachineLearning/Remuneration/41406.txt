Directors' Remuneration Report
The Remuneration Committee presents its remuneration report for the 52 weeks ended 21 April 2005. 
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, published in
July 2003 by the Financial Reporting Council and Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. The report is not
audited except where shown.
This report will be put to an advisory vote of the Company's shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on
21 September 2005.
Remuneration Committee
The composition and operation of the Committee are set out on page 45. The Committee makes
recommendations to the Board, within formal terms of reference, on the policy and framework of executive
remuneration and its cost to the Company. It has access to the Group HR Director (Judi Leavor) and the
Company Secretary (Mary Edgerton). During the year the Committee appointed and received material advice
and assistance from CJW Consultants on the design and implementation of the executive and all-employee
share schemes which were approved at the 2004 AGM. No Director is involved in the determination of, or
votes on any matter relating to, his or her own remuneration.
Remuneration Policy
In constructing the remuneration policy, the Committee aims to provide appropriate and competitive reward
for the Executive Directors and other senior executives, taking into account the Company's performance and
the markets in which it operates.
Senior remuneration packages are designed to achieve a balance between fixed and variable compensation,
with a proportion of the package being dependent on demanding short and long-term performance
objectives.
Non-executive Directors are remunerated in cash for their services plus expenses incurred in the course of
their duties. They are not eligible to participate in the Group's share option schemes, long-term incentive plan
or pension schemes and do not receive any other benefits. The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is
a matter for the executive members of the Board.
If all targets were met, the composition of each Director's remuneration would be as follows:
Non-performance related Performance related
A M Robinson 56% 44%
M P Dalby 56% 44%
S P Lane 67% 33%
J W Matthews 100% 0%
D C Mace 100% 0%
G North 100% 0%
Executive Directors
The remuneration of the Executive Directors during the period consisted of the following:
Basic Salary & Benefits - In addition to their basic salary, each Executive Director received a cash allowance
sufficient to fund an appropriate private contract purchase vehicle, private health insurance for themselves
and their immediate family, permanent health insurance and fully expensed telephone costs or an
appropriate contribution. In addition, Martin Robinson and Martin Dalby receive a private fuel allowance.
Performance related bonus scheme - The Committee has put in place an annual bonus scheme for Executive
Directors. These bonuses are subject to a cap and are only paid on the achievement of challenging short and
medium term individual and corporate objectives, which are subject to scrutiny and approval by the
Committee. All bonus payments paid in the year were performance-related based on certain profit targets and
personal objectives. The bonus payments did not contain any non-performance related elements.
Long-term incentives - At the 2004 AGM, shareholders approved four all-employee and executive incentive
schemes. With the exception of the Sharesave Scheme, no awards have been made under any of the schemes
during the year.

Subsequent to the year end, the Remuneration Committee has approved the introduction of the Long Term
Incentive Plan (LTIP) and Equity Partnership Plan (EPP) following announcement of results on 13 July 2005.
In anticipation of making these awards, the Committee has made arrangements to establish the Center Parcs
Employee Benefit Trust.
Pension Arrangements - The Executive Directors are members of the Center Parcs Senior Pension Scheme, 
a non-contributory final salary scheme with life assurance. Further details are provided on pages 48 to 49.
Directors' Service Contracts 
The Non-Executive Directors all entered into service agreements on 5 December 2003 for an initial three year
term, of which one year and eight months were unexpired as at 21 April 2005.
The Executive Directors are on rolling service contracts whereby they are required to give six months' notice
and the Company 12 months' notice. The Executive Chairman is employed to work for the Company two days
per week. He holds external directorships and undertakes these roles in his own time when not employed by
Center Parcs. Consequently, formal release and disclosure of earnings is not required under the Code.

service to the end of the current period and pensionable salary as at 21 April 2005.

The increase in the additional pension earned during the period excludes any increase for inflation. 
The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance
Note GNII, less directors' contributions. It does not represent a sum payable to individual directors and it,
therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
Martin Robinson, in addition to his membership of the Center Parcs Senior Pension Scheme (the Scheme), 
is entitled under his service contract to a cash payment equal to 0.316 times the excess of his annual salary
over the   earnings cap'' (currently  102,000). This payment is designed to compensate him for his salary
exceeding the statutory cap on the level of earnings that may be treated as pensionable under the Scheme.
This arrangement will be reviewed in light of legislative changes to the taxation of pensions, including
among other changes abolition of the   earnings cap''.
