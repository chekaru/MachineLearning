Remuneration Policy
The Board, as a whole, establishes the remuneration policy. The 
Remuneration Committee assists the Board in carrying out its 
responsibilities in relation to remuneration, including making 
recommendations to the Board on CRG's policy on executive 
remuneration, determining the individual remuneration and benefits 
package of each of the Executive Directors, and recommending and 
monitoring the remuneration of senior management below Board 
level.
The remuneration of the Executive Directors and the Chairman of the 
Board is the responsibility of the Remuneration Committee, and the 
remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is the responsibility of 
the Board as a whole. No Director is involved in determining or voting 
on their own remuneration.
In determining the policy for the Executive Directors, the Remuneration 
Committee's objective is to ensure that individuals are provided with 
appropriate incentives (on a market competitive basis) for enhanced 
performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, having regard 
to the performance of the Company, rewarded for their individual 
contributions to the success of the Company. 30 31
