Remuneration report 
Composition and role of the remuneration committee
The board has established a remuneration committee,
which is chaired by Patricia Mann. The other members of
the committee in 2002 were Roger Carr, Sir Sydney Lipworth
(until his retirement on 13 May 2002), Sir Michael Perry and
Sir Brian Shaw. Helen Alexander and Robert T obin became
members of the committee when they joined the board
on 1 January 2003. All of the members of the committee
are independent non-executive directors.
The committee makes recommendations to the
board, within formal terms of reference, on the policy
and framework of executive remuneration and its cost
to the company. The committee is also responsible
for the implementation of remuneration policy and
determining specific remuneration packages for each
of the executive directors. The committee has access
to advice provided by the group head of reward
(Mike New), the group human resources director
(Anne Minto), the company secretary (Grant Dawson),
the chief executive (Sir Roy Gardner) and external
consultants. During 2002, the committee consulted,
but did not formally appoint, T owers Perrin, who provided
survey and other information on executive compensation
to assist in the formulation of the committee's
recommendations. T owers Perrin also provided advice
to the group on retirement benefits and change management
processes during the year.
This report explains how the company has applied the
principles in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance
that relate to directors' remuneration. It will be submitted
to the forthcoming AGM for approval. No director votes
on any matter relating to his or her own remuneration.
Framework and policy on executive directors' remuneration
The group's remuneration policy is designed to provide
competitive rewards for its executive directors and other
senior executives, taking into account the company's
performance, the markets in which the group operates
and pay and conditions elsewhere in the group.
In constructing the remuneration packages, the
committee aims to achieve a balance between fixed and
variable compensation for each director. Accordingly,
a significant proportion of the remuneration package
depends on the attainment of demanding performance
objectives, both short and long term. In agreeing the level
of base salaries and the annual performance bonus scheme,
the committee takes into consideration the total remuneration
that executives could receive. The committee reviews the
packages and varies individual elements when appropriate
from year to year.
The current practice is to make conditional awards each
year under both the executive share option scheme (ESOS)
and the long term incentive scheme (LTIS). These schemes
are designed to align the interests of executive directors and
other senior executives with the longer term interests of
shareholders by rewarding them for delivering increased
shareholder value.
As a matter of policy, all executive directors and certain
senior executives are expected to retain a minimum
shareholding in the company at least equal in value
to the executive's base salary.
The committee believes that these arrangements, which
are further explained below, are important in providing a
potential remuneration package that will attract, retain and
continue to motivate executive directors and senior executives
in a marketplace that is increasingly challenging and competitive
in both commercial and human resource terms. It is intended
that the current remuneration policy, which has previously
been approved by shareholders, will continue for 2003 and
succeeding years.
In 2002, the total compensation of the executive directors,
detailed on page 27, consisted of components in the
following proportions:
Note: Salary and benefits are amounts received during 2002; pension is the increase
in transfer value less director's contributions during 2002; performance bonus is that
paid in respect of 2002; and ESOS and L TIS is the estimated value of the awards made
in 2002 based on a Black Scholes model, provided that all performance conditions
are met, at the end of the relevant performance periods.
Components of remuneration
Base salary
The committee seeks to establish a base salary for each
executive director determined by individual performance and
external market data from independent sources, in particular
salary levels for similar positions in comparable companies.
Base salaries are reviewed annually. Base salary is the only
element of remuneration that is pensionable.
Annual performance bonus
T o recognise performance against agreed objectives, the
committee has put in place an annual bonus scheme for
executive directors similar to that applying to other senior
executives in the group. Annual bonuses for executive
directors are determined by the achievement of demanding
individual, business and corporate objectives. The scheme
provided the potential for a maximum bonus payment of 60%
of base salary should every element of every objective be
achieved in full. Annual bonus objectives and targets are
approved by the committee and, in 2002, related to financial
performance, customer and employee satisfaction and
personal performance, each at 20% of base salary.
For executive directors with business unit responsibilities,
the scheme is structured to reflect the performance of their
business unit as well as that of the group. No bonus at all
is payable to an individual if their agreed minimum
personal performance target is not met.
Executive share option scheme (ESOS)
Options granted under the ESOS only become exercisable
if and to the extent that performance conditions are satisfied
three years after the date of grant. If exercisable, they remain
so until the tenth anniversary of grant. Performance conditions
are based on the extent to which growth in the company's
earnings per share (EPS growth) exceeds growth in the Retail
Prices Index (RPI growth) over a three year performance
period. EPS is calculated as fully-diluted earnings per share
adjusted for exceptional charges and goodwill amortisation.
The committee believes that this method of calculating EPS
provides an independent and verifiable measure of the
company's performance.
In respect of each grant of options, the committee has
determined that, for the option to be exercisable in full, EPS
growth must exceed RPI growth by 18 percentage points or
more over the three year performance period. No part of the
option grant will be exercisable if EPS growth fails to exceed
RPI growth by at least 9 percentage points over the performance
period. The proportion of the option grant exercisable by the

executive will increase on a sliding scale between 40%
and 100% if EPS growth exceeds RPI growth by between
9 and 18 percentage points over the performance period.
The company's EPS growth may be re-measured
annually for a further two years, but always from the date
of grant of the options, with the performance conditions
increasing proportionately. The committee believes that,
in relation to the ESOS, EPS growth in excess of RPI
growth is the most appropriate measure for determining
the increase in value delivered to shareholders by the
company's executive directors and senior executives.
The committee reviews the appropriateness of the
performance measure and the specific targets set
when considering each new grant of options.
In April 2002, options were granted to each executive
director equal to twice his base salary and, at the same or
lower rates, to certain other senior executives. Details of
options granted to executive directors are shown on page
30. It is the company's intention that new shares be issued,
subject to institutional guidelines, to satisfy the exercise
of options granted under the ESOS.
Three of the executive directors hold options under
the restructured executive share option scheme (RESOS).
The RESOS was put in place to replace options which
executives had previously held over British Gas plc
shares and which were cancelled at demerger. There
are no performance conditions attaching to options
under the RESOS. Further details are given on page 30.
Long term incentive scheme (L TIS)
Allocations of shares are made annually to executive directors
and other senior executives under the LTIS. These awards are
subject to challenging performance conditions based on the
company's total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the returns
of a comparator group, since this ensures that the executives
are not rewarded unless the company has outperformed its
peers in creating shareholder value. The committee has
determined that, in the absence of a meaningful  natural'
comparator group for the company, the companies comprising
the FTSE 100 at the start of the relevant performance period
(the LTIS comparator group) constitute the most appropriate
comparator group for the purpose of the LTIS. The committee
reviews the appropriateness of the performance measure and
the specific target set when considering each new allocation
of shares under the LTIS. In assessing the extent of satisfaction
of the performance condition, the committee uses data
provided by Hoare Govett.
Allocations made prior to May 2001 are subject to
a performance period of either three or four years (at the
participant's choice), followed by a retention period of two
years. Changes to these arrangements were approved at
the 2001 AGM. Allocations made from May 2001 will be
released to the participant under normal circumstances
after the three year performance period, provided the
performance conditions have been met.
The actual number of shares eventually released to the
participant depends on the company's TSR over the entire
performance period relative to the LTIS comparator group.
The maximum annual allocation of shares only vests and
is released to the executive if the company's TSR over the
performance period is ranked in 25th position or above
relative to the 99 other companies in the LTIS comparator
group. No shares vest if the TSR over the performance period
is ranked below 50th position in the LTIS comparator group.
Between 25th and 50th position, shares vest on a sliding
scale from 100% to 40%.
In April 2002, LTIS allocations equal to three quarters
of base salary were awarded to executive directors and,
at the same or lower rates, to certain other senior executives.
The maximum number of shares that could eventually be
transferred to each executive director upon satisfaction
of the performance criteria appears on page 29.
Prior to 2002, the trustee bought shares in the market
to match the likely future requirements for shares under
LTIS releases. Any shortfall will be satisfied by the issue
of new shares.
TSR: Centrica and FTSE 100: 1997 to 2002
The following table shows graphs of the company's TSR
performance and that of the FTSE 100 index. As required by
the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, this uses
a rolling definition of the FTSE 100, whereas the definition used
for the purposes of the LTIS is the FTSE 100 as constituted at
the beginning of the period. In order to demonstrate the delivery
of shareholder value during the respective performance periods,
TSR graphs for LTIS awards that vested in March and October
2002 are shown in the tables on page 29.
Other employment benefits
In common with other senior management, executive directors
are entitled to a range of benefits, including a contributory, final
salary pension (see pages 27 and 28), a company car, life
assurance, private medical insurance and a financial counselling
scheme. They are also eligible, on the same basis as other
employees, to participate in the company's Inland Revenue-
approved sharesave and share incentive plans. These are open
to all eligible employees and provide a long term savings and
investment opportunity.
Service contracts
It is the company's policy for the notice period in executive
directors' service contracts not to exceed one year. The
committee retains a level of flexibility in order to offer
contracts to new executive directors that contain an initial
notice period in excess of one year, provided that after the
first such period the notice period reduces to one year. 
The executive directors' service contracts have no
fixed term but provide that either the director or the company
may terminate the employment by giving one year's written
notice and that the company may pay compensation
in lieu of notice. Phillip Bentley's contract provides for
an initial notice period of two years, which reverted in
November 2002 to one year on the same basis as the other
executive directors. The dates of the executive directors'
service contracts are disclosed in the table on page 27 .
Upon Mike Alexander's retirement from the board on
28 February 2003, he will forfeit all of the options granted
to him under the ESOS (see the table on page 30) and the
conditional allocations of shares made to him under the
LTIS on 2 October 2000, 1 October 2001 and 2 April 2002
(see the table on page 29). The performance targets in
respect of the allocations of shares made to him under the
LTIS on 1 October 1998 and 7 October 1999 have previously
been achieved and those shares will be released to him at
the end of the retention periods on 30 September 2003 and
30 September 2004, respectively. Mike Alexander will not
receive any payments other than his pension, the details
of which are disclosed on pages 27 and 28.

External appointments of executive directors
The board believes that experience of other companies' practices and challenges is valuable both for the personal development
of its executive directors and for the company. It is therefore the company's policy to allow each executive director to accept one 
non-executive directorship of another company, although the board retains the discretion to vary this policy. Fees are retained by
the individual director. Details of individual directors' external appointments are given in their biographies on page 21.
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors do not hold service contracts. The dates of their appointment are shown in the table below. Their
appointment is subject to the articles of association. Their fees are determined having regard to the need to attract individuals 
of the right calibre and experience, the time and responsibilities entailed and the fees paid by other companies. Their fees are
approved by the board, upon the recommendation of the executive committee, whose members are the executive directors listed 
in the table below, together with Grant Dawson, general counsel and company secretary. The executive committee received survey
and other information from the remuneration consultants, T owers Perrin. The non-executive directors, including the chairman,
do not participate in any of the company's share schemes, incentive plans or pension schemes.
In addition to their fees as non-executive directors of the company, Sir Brian Shaw received fees for consultancy services to the
AA Motoring Policy Unit and Sir Sydney Lipworth received fees for services as a non-executive director of Goldfish Bank Limited.
The remuneration report from page 25 to page 27 up to this statement has not been audited. From this point until the end of the report
on page 30, the disclosures, with the exception of the two line graphs on page 29, have been audited.

Directors' pensions
The pension arrangements for the executive directors, who are all members of the Centrica staff pension scheme, are shown below.
The staff pension scheme is a funded, Inland Revenue-approved, final salary, occupational pension scheme. Its rules provide for the
following main features:
  normal retirement at age 65;
  right to an immediate, unreduced pension on retirement at age 60;
  right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service after age 55, subject to 10 years' service and company consent;
  right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service on reorganisation or for redundancy after age 50;
  life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary;
  spouse's pension on death in service payable at the rate of two thirds of the member's prospective pension and, on death after
retirement, two thirds of accrued pension. Children's pensions are also payable;
  members' contributions payable at the rate of 4% of pensionable earnings;
  pension payable in the event of retirement due to ill health;
  pensions in payment and in deferment guaranteed to increase in line with the increase in the RPI; and
  no discretionary practices are taken into account in calculating transfer values. 28 Centrica plc report 2002
Remuneration report continued
All benefits are subject to Inland Revenue limits. Where such limitation is due to the earnings  cap', benefits are increased to the level
that would otherwise have been paid and are provided via the Centrica unapproved pension scheme. This scheme is unfunded but
the benefits are secured by a charge over Centrica's assets to give security equivalent to the pensions provided to other employees.
An appropriate provision in respect of their accrued value has been made in the company's balance sheet.

(i) At the end of the respective performance periods (2 March 2000 and 30 September 2000), the company ranked in sixth and fourth
positions respectively in the relevant LTIS comparator groups. Accordingly, 100% of the allocations were released on the vesting
dates (4 March 2002 and 1 October 2002 respectively) following the expiry of the two year retention period. These shares were
subject to income tax at the individual's marginal rate, based on the market value of the shares at the date of vesting. The income
tax liability was satisfied by the sale of sufficient shares and, accordingly, the directors only received the net number of shares
following disposal, which is reflected in the shareholdings as at 31 December 2002 in the second table on page 28.
(ii) At the end of the respective performance periods (30 September 2001 and 30 September 2002), the company ranked fourth
in the relevant LTIS comparator groups. Accordingly, 100% of the allocations are being held in trust for a further two years
at the end of which time they will be released to the directors at the trustee's discretion.
(iii) The performance period relating to this allocation will end on 1 October 2003. If and to the extent that the performance
condition is met, the relevant number of shares will then be held in trust for two years, at the end of which time they will
be released to the directors at the trustee's discretion.
(iv) The respective performance periods relating to these allocations will end on 30 September 2004 and 1 April 2005.
If and to the extent that the performance conditions are met, the allocations will vest and the relevant number
of shares will be released to the directors, at the trustee's discretion.
(v) The end of the qualifying period is the date on which it is judged whether or not the qualifying conditions
(see LTIS section on page 26) have been fulfilled.
(vi) The vesting date was the next business day after the end of the qualifying period.

(i) Restructured executive share option scheme (RESOS)
Options granted to company employees under the British Gas plc executive share option scheme prior to February 1997 were
cancelled and replaced at demerger by non-Inland Revenue-approved options to acquire Centrica shares. The replacement
options were granted on the same terms as British Gas executive share options, with the same exercise date and aggregate
exercise price per share, and the number of shares placed under option was adjusted to take account of the demerger.
No further options have been or will be granted under this scheme.
(ii) Executive share option scheme (ESOS)
Options were granted to executives under the terms of the Centrica executive share option scheme on 31 May 2001
and 2 April 2002. For details of the operation of this scheme see page 25.
(iii) Sharesave scheme
The company operates an Inland Revenue-approved all-employee savings-related share option scheme. The scheme
is designed to provide a long term savings and investment opportunity for employees and is described on page 22.
(iv) Exercise of share options
Options were exercised at the following dates and prices: (a) 5 April 2002 at 225 pence; (b) 5 June 2002 at 207.5 pence; and 
(c) 1 July 2002 at 202.75 pence.
No director's options lapsed during the year.
The closing price of a Centrica ordinary share on the last trading day of 2002 (31 December) was 171 pence. The range during
the year was 239 pence (high) and 150 pence (low).
