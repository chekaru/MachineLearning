 Remuneration report 
Composition and role of the remuneration committee
The board has established a remuneration committee,
which is chaired by Patricia Mann. Helen Alexander , 
Roger Carr , Sir Michael Perry and Robert T obin were
members of the committee throughout 2003. Paul Walsh
became a member when he joined the board on 1 March
2003. All members are non-executive directors and, with
the exception of Sir Michael Perry , are independent.
The committee makes recommendations to the
board, within formal terms of reference, on the policy
and framework of executive remuneration and its cost
to the company . The committee is also responsible
for the implementation of remuneration policy and
determining specific remuneration packages for each
of the executive directors. It has access to advice
provided by the group human resources director
(Anne Minto), the group head of reward (Mike New), 
the company secretary (Grant Dawson), the chief
executive (Sir Roy Gardner) and external consultants.
During 2003, the committee consulted, but did not
formally appoint, T owers Perrin, who provided information
and advice on executive compensation to assist in the
formulation of the committee' s recommendations.
T owers Perrin also provided advice to the group 
on retirement benefits and non-executive directors' 
fees during the year .
This report explains how the company has applied 
the principles in the 1998 Combined Code on Corporate
Governance that relate to directors' remuneration. 
It will be submitted to the forthcoming AGM for approval.
No director votes on any matter relating to his or her 
own remuneration.
Framework and policy on executive directors'
remuneration
The group' s remuneration policy is designed to provide
competitive rewards for its executive directors and other
senior executives, taking into account the company' s
performance, the markets in which the group operates
and pay and conditions elsewhere in the group.
In constructing the remuneration packages, the
committee aims to achieve a balance between fixed and
variable compensation for each director . Accordingly ,
a significant proportion of the remuneration package
depends on the attainment of demanding performance
objectives, both short and long term. In agreeing the 
level of base salaries and the annual performance 
bonus scheme, the committee takes into consideration 
the total remuneration that executives could receive. 
The committee reviews the packages and varies individual
elements when appropriate from year to year .
T o recognise performance against agreed objectives, 
the committee has put in place an annual bonus scheme
for executive directors similar to that applying to other
senior executives in the group. Annual bonuses for
executive directors are determined by the achievement 
of demanding individual, business and corporate
objectives.
Under both the executive share option scheme (ESOS)
and the long term incentive scheme (L TIS) the current
practice is to make conditional awards each year up to a
maximum of 200% and 75% of base salary respectively .
These schemes are designed to align the interests of
executive directors and other senior executives with the
longer term interests of shareholders by rewarding them 
for delivering increased shareholder value.
As a matter of policy , all executive directors and certain
senior executives are expected to retain a minimum
shareholding in the company at least equal in value
to the executive' s base salary .
Executive directors also participate in a contributory , 
final salary pension scheme (details of which are given 
on pages 35 and 36).
The committee believes that these arrangements, which
are further explained below, are important in providing 
a potential remuneration package that will attract, retain
and continue to motivate executive directors and senior
executives in a marketplace that is increasingly challenging
and competitive in both commercial and human resource
terms. It is intended that the current remuneration policy , the
ESOS and L TIS elements of which have been approved by
shareholders, will continue for 2004 and succeeding years.
In 2003, the total compensation of the executive directors,
detailed on page 32, consisted of components in the
following proportions:
Note: Salary and benefits are amounts received during 2003; pension is the increase
in transfer value less directors' contributions during 2003; performance bonus is that
paid in respect of 2003; and ESOS and L TIS are the estimated value of the awards made 
in 2003 based on a Black Scholes model, provided that all performance conditions
are met at the end of the relevant performance periods. In 2003, Mike Alexander served
as a director for January and February only . Because of his retirement he was not eligible
to participate in ESOS grants and L TIS allocations made in 2003, nor did he receive a bonus
in respect of the year . Accordingly , no part of his remuneration was performance related.
Components of remuneration
Base salary
The committee seeks to establish a base salary for each
executive director determined by individual performance
and having regard to market salary levels for similar positions
in comparable companies derived from independent
sources. Base salaries are reviewed annually . Base salary
is the only element of remuneration that is pensionable.
Annual performance bonus
At the beginning of each year , the committee reviews the
bonus scheme to ensure that it remains competitive in the
market and continues to incentivise the executive directors

Remuneration report continued
and align their interests with those of shareholders. For
2003, having reviewed comparative data provided by
T owers Perrin, the committee increased the relative weight
given to financial performance targets and adjusted the
maximum bonus payable should every element of every
objective be achieved in full from 60% to 100% of base
salary . In 2003, 50% of the maximum bonus achievable
related to financial performance targets, 25% to customer
and employee satisfaction and 25% to personal
performance. For executive directors with business unit
responsibilities, the scheme is structured to reflect the
performance of their business unit as well as that of the
group. No bonus at all is payable to an individual whose
agreed minimum personal targets are not met.
Executive share option scheme (ESOS)
Options granted under the ESOS only become 
exercisable if and to the extent that performance
conditions are satisfied three years after the date 
of grant. If exercisable, they remain so until the tenth
anniversary of grant. Performance conditions are 
based on the extent to which growth in the company' s
earnings per share (EPS growth) exceeds growth in 
the Retail Prices Index (RPI growth) over a three year
performance period. EPS is calculated as fully diluted
earnings per share adjusted for exceptional charges 
and goodwill amortisation. The committee believes 
that this method of calculating EPS provides an
independent and verifiable measure of the 
company' s performance.
In respect of each grant of options, the committee has
determined that, for the option to be exercisable in full, 
EPS growth must exceed RPI growth by 18 percentage
points or more over the three year performance period. 
No part of the option grant will be exercisable if EPS 
growth fails to exceed RPI growth by at least 9 percentage
points over the performance period. The proportion 
of the option grant exercisable by the executive will
increase on a sliding scale between 40% and 100% 
if EPS growth exceeds RPI growth by between 9 and 
18 percentage points over the performance period.
The company' s EPS growth may be re-measured
annually for a further two years, but always from the 
date of grant of the options, with the performance
conditions increasing proportionately . The committee
believes that, in relation to the ESOS, EPS growth in 
excess of RPI growth is the most appropriate measure 
for determining the increase in value delivered to
shareholders by the company' s executive directors
and senior executives. The committee reviews the
appropriateness of the performance measure and
the specific targets set when considering each 
new grant of options.
In March 2003, options were granted to each executive
director equal to 200% of his base salary and, at the same
or lower rates, to certain other senior executives. Details 
of options granted to executive directors are shown on
page 34. It is the company' s intention that new shares be
issued, subject to institutional guidelines, to satisfy the
exercise of options granted under the ESOS.
One executive director holds an option under the
restructured executive share option scheme (RESOS).
The RESOS was put in place to replace options which
executives had previously held over British Gas plc
shares and which were cancelled at demerger . There
are no performance conditions attaching to options
under the RESOS. Further details are given on page 34.
Long term incentive scheme (L TIS)
Allocations of shares are made annually to executive
directors and other senior executives under the L TIS.
These awards are subject to challenging performance
conditions based on the company' s total shareholder
return (TSR) relative to the returns of a comparator
group, since this ensures that the executives are not
rewarded unless the company has outperformed its 
peers in creating shareholder value. The committee has
determined that, in the absence of a meaningful  natural'
comparator group for the company , the companies
comprising the FTSE 100 at the start of the relevant
performance period (the L TIS comparator group) 
constitute the most appropriate comparator group for 
the purpose of the L TIS. The committee reviews the
appropriateness of the performance measure and 
the specific target set when considering each new
allocation of shares under the L TIS. In assessing the
extent of satisfaction of the performance condition,
the committee uses data provided by Alithos Limited.
Allocations made prior to May 2001 are subject to
a performance period of either three or four years 
(at the participant' s choice), followed by a retention 
period of two years. Changes to these arrangements 
were approved at the 2001 AGM. Allocations made 
from May 2001 will be released to the participant 
under normal circumstances after the three year
performance period, provided the performance 
conditions have been met.
The actual number of shares eventually released to the
participant depends on the company' s TSR over the entire
performance period relative to the L TIS comparator group.
The maximum annual allocation of shares only vests and
is released to the executive if the company' s TSR over the
performance period is ranked in 25th position or above
relative to the 99 other companies in the L TIS comparator
group. No shares vest if the TSR over the performance
period is ranked below 50th position in the L TIS
comparator group. Between 25th and 50th position, 
shares vest on a sliding scale from 100% to 40%.
In April 2003, L TIS allocations equal to 75% of base 
salary were awarded to executive directors and,
at the same or lower rates, to certain other senior
executives. The maximum number of shares that 
could eventually be transferred to each executive 
director upon satisfaction of the performance criteria
appears on page 33.
Prior to 2002, the trustee of the L TIS bought shares 
in the market to match the likely future requirements 
for shares under L TIS releases. Any shortfall will be 
satisfied by the issue of new shares. Centrica plc report 2003 31
TSR - Centrica and FTSE 100: 1999-2003
The table above shows graphs of the company' s TSR
performance and that of the FTSE 100 Index for the five
years ended 31 December 2003. As required by the
Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, this
uses a rolling definition of the FTSE 100, whereas the
definition used for the purposes of the L TIS is the FTSE 100
as constituted at the beginning of the period. In order to
demonstrate the delivery of shareholder value during the
relevant performance period, the TSR graph for the L TIS
award that vested in October 2003 is shown on page 33.
Pension
Executive directors also participate in a contributory , final
salary pension scheme (details of which are given on pages
35 and 36).
Other employment benefits
In common with other senior management, executive
directors are entitled to a range of benefits, including a
company car , life assurance, private medical insurance 
and a financial counselling scheme. They are also eligible,
on the same basis as other employees, to participate in
the company' s Inland Revenue approved sharesave 
and share incentive plans. These are open to all eligible
employees and provide a long term savings and
investment opportunity .
Service contracts
It is the company' s policy for the notice period in executive
directors' service contracts not to exceed one year . The
committee retains a level of flexibility in order to offer
contracts to new executive directors that contain an initial
notice period in excess of one year , provided that after the
first such period the notice period reduces to one year . 
The executive directors' service contracts have no fixed
term but provide that either the director or the company
may terminate the employment by giving one year' s 
written notice and that the company may pay
compensation in lieu of notice.
The dates of the executive directors' service contracts 
are set out in the table on page 32.
Upon Mike Alexander' s retirement from the board on
28 February 2003, he forfeited all of the options granted
to him under the ESOS (see the table on page 34) and the
conditional allocations of shares made to him under the
L TIS on 2 October 2000, 1 October 2001 and 2 April 2002
(see the table on page 33). The performance targets in
respect of the allocations of shares made to him under the
L TIS on 1 October 1998 and 7 October 1999 had previously
been achieved and those shares were or will be released to
him at the end of the retention periods on 30 September
2003 and 30 September 2004 respectively . Mike Alexander
has not received and will not receive any payments other
than his pension, the details of which are disclosed
on pages 35 to 36.
External appointments of executive directors
The board believes that experience of other companies'
practices and challenges is valuable both for the personal
development of its executive directors and for the
company . It is therefore the company' s policy to allow 
each executive director to accept one non-executive
directorship of another company , although the board
retains the discretion to vary this policy . Fees are retained
by the individual director . 
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors do not hold service contracts. 
The dates of their appointment are shown in the table on
page 32. Their appointment is subject to the articles of
association. Their fees are determined having regard 
to the need to attract individuals of the right calibre and
experience, the time and responsibilities entailed and the
fees paid by other companies. Their fees are approved 
by the board, upon the recommendation of the executive
committee, whose members are the executive directors
listed in the second table on page 32, together with 
Grant Dawson, general counsel and company secretary .
The executive committee received survey and other
information from the remuneration consultants, T owers
Perrin. The non-executive directors, including the
chairman, do not participate in any of the company' s 
share schemes, incentive plans or pension schemes.
In addition to his fees as a non-executive director of the
company , Sir Brian Shaw received fees for consultancy
services to The Automobile Association Limited.
The remuneration report from page 29 to page 31 up to this
statement has not been audited. From this point until the
end of the report on page 36, the disclosures, with the
exception of the line graph on page 33, have been audited.

(i) At the end of the performance period to 30 September 2001, the company ranked in fourth position in the relevant
L TIS comparator group. Accordingly , 100% of the allocations were released on the vesting date of 1 October 2003
following the expiry of the two year retention period. These shares were subject to income tax at the individual' s
marginal rate and national insurance contributions (NICs) at the rate of 1%, based on the market value of the shares at
the date of vesting. The income tax and NICs liability was satisfied by the sale of sufficient shares and, accordingly , the
directors only received the net number of shares following disposal, which is reflected in the shareholdings as at
31 December 2003 in the second table on page 32.
(ii) At the end of the performance period to 30 September 2002, the company ranked fourth in the relevant L TIS
comparator group. Accordingly , 100% of the allocations are being held in trust for a further two years, at the end
of which time they will be released to the directors at the trustee' s discretion.
(iii) At the end of the performance period to 1 October 2003, the company ranked in fortieth position in the relevant L TIS
comparator group. Accordingly , 75% of the original allocations are being held in trust for a further two years, at the end
of which time they will be released to the directors at the trustee' s discretion.
(iv) The respective performance periods relating to these allocations will end on 30 September 2004, 1 April 2005 and
31 March 2006. If, and to the extent that, the performance conditions are met, the allocations will vest and the relevant
number of shares will be released to the directors at the trustee' s discretion.
(v) Details of the treatment of allocations on Mike Alexander' s retirement from the board on 28 February 2003 appear

Options were granted to executives under the terms of the Centrica executive share option scheme on 31 May 2001,
2 April 2002 and 24 March 2003. Details of the operation of this scheme are provided on page 30.
(ii) Sharesave scheme
The company operates an Inland Revenue approved all-employee savings related share option scheme. The scheme
is designed to provide a long term savings and investment opportunity for employees and is described on page 26.
(iii) Restructured executive share option scheme (RESOS)
Options granted to company employees under the British Gas plc executive share option scheme prior to February
1997 were cancelled and replaced at demerger by non-Inland Revenue approved options to acquire Centrica shares.
The replacement options were granted on the same terms as British Gas executive share options, with the same
exercise date and aggregate exercise price per share, and the number of shares placed under option was adjusted to
take account of the demerger . No further options have been or will be granted under this scheme.
(iv) Exercise of share options
Options were exercised at the following dates and prices: 
(a) 28 August 2003 at 177 pence; and
(b) 4 April 2003 at 158 pence.
The closing price of a Centrica ordinary share on the last trading day of 2003 (31 December) was 211 pence. The range 
during the year was 212.75 pence (high) and 131.5 pence (low). Centrica plc report 2003 35
Directors' pensions
The pension arrangements for the executive directors, all of whom are members of the Centrica pension scheme, 
are shown below.
The Centrica pension scheme is a funded, Inland Revenue approved, final salary , occupational pension scheme. 
Its rules provide for the following main features:
  normal retirement at age 65 (see note on normal retirement age below);
  right to an immediate, unreduced pension on retirement at age 60;
  right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service after age 55, subject to 10 years' service and 
company consent;
  right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service on reorganisation or for redundancy after age 50;
  life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary;
  spouse' s pension on death in service payable at the rate of two thirds of the member' s prospective pension and, 
on death after retirement, two thirds of accrued pension. Children' s pensions are also payable;
  members' contributions payable at the rate of 4% of pensionable earnings;
  pension payable in the event of retirement due to ill health;
  pensions in payment and in deferment guaranteed to increase in line with the increase in the RPI; and
  no discretionary practices are taken into account in calculating transfer values.
All benefits are subject to Inland Revenue limits. Where such limitation is due to the earnings  cap', benefits are increased
to the level that would otherwise have been paid and are provided via the Centrica unapproved pension scheme. This
scheme is unfunded but the benefits are secured by a charge over Centrica' s assets to give security equivalent to the
pensions provided to other employees. An appropriate provision in respect of their accrued value has been made in the
company' s balance sheet.
Normal retirement age
Having considered external market practice and the retirement provision made within Centrica for other senior managers, 
it has been agreed that the executive directors and certain other senior executives will be offered a one-off opportunity to
leave the Centrica pension scheme and join the Centrica management pension scheme. This offer is consistent with the
historical treatment of the Centrica senior management population.
The Centrica management pension scheme has a normal retirement age of 62. Individual accrual rates in respect of past 
and future service will be increased so that the pension expectations of individuals transferring across will be the same 
at the retirement age of 62 as they would have been had they retired at age 65. No individual transferring will receive benefits
from Centrica which when added to their retained benefits elsewhere exceed two thirds of their final pensionable salary .
Further , any request for early retirement will require company consent.
For those members who are affected by the operation of the earnings  cap', Centrica provides top up benefits via 
an unapproved arrangement. The benefits that arise under this are treated as being subject to the same rules 
as apply in respect of the approved portion of the members' benefits.

(i) Accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age 65, based on eligible service to
31 December 2003.
(ii) The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes any pension arising from additional voluntary contributions.
The increase in accrued pension adjusted to exclude inflation may be derived by discounting the figure in the first
column by the rate of inflation (2.8% - see note (iv)) and subtracting the figure in the second column.
(iii) Contributions were paid in the year by the directors under the terms of the scheme up to the maximum rate of 15% 
of the earnings  cap'.
(iv) The rate of inflation used was 2.8%, the annual rate to 30 September 2003, the date used for pension increases 
under the scheme.
(v) The accrued pension shown for Mike Alexander includes a credit in relation to a transfer from a previous 
employer' s pension scheme.
