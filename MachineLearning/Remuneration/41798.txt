 Remuneration Report 
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 28 
Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee 
During 2005, the Remuneration Committee comprised Helen 
Alexander, Mary Francis, Patricia Mann, Paul Rayner and Paul 
Walsh, all of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The Committee met six times during the year and was chaired 
by Patricia Mann until 30 June 2005 when Helen Alexander 
was appointed Chairman of the Committee. Andrew 
Mackenzie was appointed a member of the Committee on  
21 February 2006. The Remuneration Committee's terms  
of reference are available at www.centrica.com.  
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board, 
within formal terms of reference, on the policy and framework 
of executive remuneration and its cost to the Company.  
The Committee is also responsible for the implementation of 
remuneration policy and determining specific remuneration 
packages for each of the Executive Directors. It has access  
to the advice and views of the Group Reward Director (Cathy 
Aldwinckle, who replaced Mike New in July 2005), the Group 
Human Resources Director (Anne Minto), the General Counsel 
& Company Secretary (Grant Dawson), the Chief Executive  
(Sir Roy Gardner) and external consultants.  
In 2005, the Committee consulted, but did not formally 
appoint, Towers Perrin. During the year, the Committee 
conducted a review of a number of external remuneration 
consultants. This process resulted in the selection and  
formal appointment by the Committee in September of  
Kepler Associates (Kepler) as independent executive 
remuneration adviser to the Company and the Committee. 
Both remuneration consultants provided advice on  
executive compensation to assist in the formulation of the 
Committee's recommendations. 
This report, which will be submitted to the forthcoming 
AGM for approval, explains how the Company has applied the 
principles of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
(the  Code') that relate to Directors' remuneration during the 
year. No Director is involved in the determination of, or votes 
on any matter relating to, his or her own remuneration. 
 
Executive Directors' remuneration policy and framework 
It is the role of the Committee to ensure that the Group's 
remuneration policy and framework provides competitive 
reward for its Executive Directors and other senior executives, 
taking into account the Company's performance, the markets 
in which it operates and pay and conditions elsewhere in  
the Group. 
In constructing the remuneration packages, the Committee 
aims to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and 
variable compensation for each executive. Accordingly, a 
significant proportion of the remuneration package depends  
on the attainment of demanding performance objectives, both 
short- and long-term. The annual bonus scheme is designed 
to incentivise and reward the achievement of demanding 
financial and non-financial corporate and individual objectives. 
Long-term share-based incentives are designed to align the 
interests of Executive Directors and other senior executives 
with the longer-term interests of shareholders by rewarding 
them for delivering sustained increased shareholder value.  
In agreeing the level of base salaries and the performance-
related elements of the remuneration package, the Committee 
considers the potential maximum remuneration that executives 
could receive. The Committee reviews the packages and 
varies individual elements when appropriate from year to year. 
The Group's current remuneration policy and framework  
for Executive Directors and other senior executives, which  
has been in place since it was approved by shareholders at  
the 2001 AGM, comprises base salary, annual performance 
bonus and participation in the Executive Share Option Scheme 
(ESOS) and Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS).  
In the second half of 2005, assisted by Kepler and the internal 
advisers named above, the Committee conducted a thorough 
review of the Group's executive incentive arrangements to 
ensure that they: provide a strong alignment with the delivery 
of value to shareholders; reflect current best practice, while 
meeting the Group's particular business needs; and enable the 
Group to continue to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre 
management in a highly-challenging business environment. 
Following this review, the Committee has proposed 
changes to the future policy and framework of annual and 
long-term incentive arrangements. The aim of the proposals  
is to re-balance total remuneration by strengthening the 
performance-related elements and encouraging executives  
to invest some of their bonuses in direct shareholdings in  
the Company. The Committee has consulted with the ABI
1
,  
the RREV
2
 and the Company's major shareholders on  
these proposals. 
Subject to shareholder approval at the 2006 AGM of  
new long-term share-based incentives (full details of which  
are included in the Notice of Meeting for the 2006 AGM)  
the Committee has agreed that, in the future, executive 
remuneration should comprise base salary, annual 
performance bonus, a new LTIS and a new Deferred and 
Matching Share Scheme (DMSS). The performance targets,  
in respect of each of the new schemes (details of which are 
included in  Components of remuneration' below) reflect 
present trading conditions, existing market expectations and 
current inflation rates. In a period of considerable uncertainty  
in the global energy markets, the Committee believes that 
these new targets are stretching, but will review the targets  
at the beginning of each performance period to ensure they 
remain so. Performance targets will not be materially adjusted 
without prior consultation with major shareholders and will  
be published in the Annual Report. In line with current policy, 
none of the new schemes will allow the retesting of 
performance targets. 
As a result of these changes, the Committee expects  
that total remuneration for median performance will remain 
unchanged, but that total remuneration for upper quartile 
performance will be increased in line with market practice. 
Pursuant to this new policy, it is proposed that awards 
under the new LTIS commence in 2006 and that the DMSS  
is operated from 2007 (to replace ESOS), based on the annual 
performance bonus payable in respect of 2006. From 2006, 
the maximum payment under the annual performance bonus 
scheme will be increased by 25% to reflect the proportion of 
bonus that will be automatically invested in the DMSS. 
A grant of options under ESOS will be made in April 2006  
in accordance with the 2001 policy, following which, if the new 
LTIS and the DMSS are approved by shareholders, no further 
ESOS grants will be made on a regular basis. However, the 
Committee will retain a general discretion to make grants 
under ESOS in the future if there are exceptional 
circumstances in which it considers it appropriate to do so. 
As a matter of policy, all Executive Directors and those 
senior executives immediately below Board level are expected 
to retain a minimum shareholding in the Company at least 
equal in value to the executive's base salary. Under the new 
policy the minimum shareholding requirement will increase to 
two times base salary for the Chief Executive and 1.25 times 
base salary for the other Executive Directors. The requirement 
remains unchanged for senior executives immediately below 
Board level.

Executive Directors also participate in a contributory, final 
salary pension scheme (details of which are given on page 36). 
The Committee believes that these arrangements, which 
are further explained below, are important in providing a 
potential remuneration package that will attract, retain and 
continue to motivate Executive Directors and other senior 
executives in a marketplace that is challenging and competitive 
in both commercial and human resource terms. It is intended 
that this new remuneration policy and framework, which is fully 
endorsed by the Board, will continue for 2006 and succeeding 
years.  
In 2005, the total emoluments of the Executive Directors, 
detailed on page 32, consisted of components in the  
following proportions:

transfer value for 2004 less the Director's contributions during 2005; 
performance bonus is that payable in respect of 2005; and ESOS and LTIS 
are the estimated value, based on a Black-Scholes model, of the awards 
made in 2005, provided that all performance conditions are met in full at 
the end of the relevant performance periods. 
 
The total emoluments of the Executive Directors are disclosed 
on page 32. The total emoluments of the four senior 
executives immediately below Board level for 2005, calculated 
on the same basis as those of the Executive Directors, fell into 
the following bands:

 200-300 1
 
Note: One senior executive served for only six months of the year and 
accordingly only the amount received by the individual in respect of that 
period is shown above. 
 
Components of remuneration 
Base salary 
The Committee seeks to establish a base salary for each 
Executive Director and other senior executives, determined  
by individual performance and having regard to market salary 
levels for similar positions in comparable companies derived 
from independent sources. Base salaries are reviewed  
annually. Base salary is the only element of remuneration  
that is pensionable. 
 
Annual performance bonus 
At the beginning of each year, the Committee reviews the 
annual performance bonus scheme to ensure that it remains 
competitive in the marketplace, continues to incentivise the 
Executive Directors and other senior executives and aligns 
their interests with those of shareholders. For 2005, the 
maximum bonus payable to Executive Directors, should  
every single element of every objective be achieved in full,  
was 100% of base salary. In 2005, 65% of the maximum 
bonus achievable related to financial performance targets, 
25% to customer and employee satisfaction levels and 10%  
to personal performance. For Executive Directors with specific 
business responsibilities, the scheme is structured to reflect 
the performance of their business as well as that of the Group. 
The maximum bonus payable to other senior executives 
immediately below Board level, assuming all objectives are 
achieved in full, ranges between 80% and 100%, with the 
three performance categories in the same proportions as 
those for the Executive Directors. 
Pursuant to the new policy (described on pages 28 and 29) 
and commencing in respect of 2006, the Committee has 
agreed to increase the maximum amount of annual bonus 
payable to Executive Directors, upon the attainment in full of 
challenging targets, from 100% of base salary to 125% of 
base salary. Similarly, the maximum bonus payable to other 
senior executives will increase from a range of between 80% 
and 100% to a range of between 100% and 125% of base 
salary. 20% of any annual bonus paid (representing the 
increased portion of the annual bonus) will be invested 
automatically in the DMSS. The Committee has also changed 
the bonus structure for Executive Directors and executives 
immediately below Board level. The maximum achievable 
bonus will relate to financial performance targets and 
business-related targets split, 65% and 35% respectively  
for Executive Directors and 60% and 40% respectively for 
executives immediately below Board level. In line with current 
policy, a bonus will be forfeited if overall performance is 
deemed to be unsatisfactory. 
Following the adoption of IFRS in 2005, the Committee 
agreed, having taken advice from Kepler and having consulted 
with the ABI and the RREV, to continue with the financial  
target of economic profit calculated in accordance with  
IFRS adjusted for exceptional items and certain re-
measurements arising on the application of IAS 32 and IAS 39 
(see the footnote to the Group Income Statement on page 40, 
note 3 on pages 51 and 52 and note 7 on pages 57 and 58) 
excluded on the grounds that such standards do not represent 
the underlying performance of the business. 
 
Deferred and Matching Share Scheme (DMSS) 
Subject to shareholder approval at the 2006 AGM, it is 
proposed to introduce a DMSS pursuant to which 20%  
of the annual bonus paid to Executive Directors and other 
senior executives will be deferred automatically for a period of 
three years and invested in Centrica shares (deferred shares), 
during which time they cannot normally be withdrawn. 
Participants may elect to invest an additional amount in the 
DMSS to be contributed from actual bonus paid or shares 
released from the LTIS only, which when added to the value  
of the deferred shares, will bring the total amount invested  
up to 50% of the individual's maximum bonus entitlement in 
respect of the preceding year. Deferred and invested shares 
will be matched with conditional shares, which will be released 
to the extent that demanding Group economic profit 
performance targets are achieved over a three-year period. 
The number of matching shares that would vest will be 
determined on a straight-line basis from a zero match for  
no growth in economic profit to a two-times match for growth 
of 25% or above. To provide a closer alignment with the 
interests of shareholders, the number of conditional matched 
shares that are released following the satisfaction of the 
performance condition will be increased to reflect the  Remuneration Report continued 
 
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 30 
dividends that would have been paid during the three-year 
performance period. 
It is proposed that the DMSS will operate in 2007, based  
on the annual performance bonus paid in respect of 2006. 
 
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) 
In accordance with the remuneration policy adopted in 2001, 
grants of options have been made annually to Executive 
Directors and other senior executives under ESOS. If, and to 
the extent that, performance conditions are satisfied, options 
normally become exercisable three years after the date of 
grant and remain so until the tenth anniversary of grant. 
Performance conditions are based on the extent to which 
growth in the Company's earnings per share (EPS growth) 
exceeds growth in the Retail Prices Index (RPI growth) over  
a three-year performance period. 
Following the adoption of IFRS in 2005, the Committee 
agreed that EPS remains an appropriate, objective, 
independent and verifiable measure of the Company's 
performance. However, having taken advice from Kepler and 
having consulted with the ABI and the RREV, the Committee 
agreed that EPS should be calculated as fully-diluted earnings 
per share, adjusted for exceptional items and certain re-
measurements arising on the application of IAS 32 and IAS 39 
(see the footnote to the Group Income Statement on page 40, 
note 3 on pages 51 and 52, note 7 on pages 57 and 58 and 
note 12 on pages 61 and 62) excluded on the grounds that 
such standards do not represent the underlying performance 
of the business. 
In respect of each grant of options, the Committee has 
determined that, for the option to be exercisable in full, EPS 
growth must exceed RPI growth by 18 percentage points or 
more over the three-year performance period. No part of the 
option grant will be exercisable if EPS growth fails to exceed RPI 
growth by at least 9 percentage points over the performance 
period. The proportion of the option grant exercisable by the 
executive will increase on a sliding scale between 40% and 
100% if EPS growth exceeds RPI growth by between 9 and  
18 percentage points over the performance period. 
Options granted from 2001 to March 2004 under the  
ESOS permitted the Company's EPS to be measured annually 
for a further two years from the date of grant of the options, 
with the performance conditions increasing proportionately. 
Having reviewed market practice regarding the retesting of 
performance measures, the Committee removed this element 
in respect of all option grants from September 2004. The 
Committee continues to believe that, in relation to the ESOS, 
EPS growth in excess of RPI growth is the most appropriate 
measure for determining the increase in value delivered to 
shareholders by the Company's Executive Directors and other 
senior executives. The Committee reviews the appropriateness 
of the performance measure and the specific targets set when 
considering each new grant of options. 
In April 2005, options were granted to each Executive 
Director equal to 200% of base salary and, at the same or 
lower rates, to certain other senior executives. Details of 
options granted to Executive Directors are shown on page 35.  
As reported in the section on policy and framework above, 
it is not intended to make further grants under this scheme 
after April 2006, other than in exceptional circumstances. 
 
Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS) 
In accordance with the remuneration policy adopted in 2001, 
allocations of shares have been made annually to Executive 
Directors and other senior executives under the LTIS. These 
awards are subject to challenging performance conditions 
based on the Company's total shareholder return (TSR) relative 
to the returns of a comparator group over a three-year period. 
Accordingly, executives are not rewarded unless the  
Company has outperformed its peers in respect of share  
price movements and dividend payments. The Committee  
has determined that, for the purpose of the LTIS, the most 
appropriate comparator group for the Company is the 
companies comprising the FTSE 100 at the start of the 
relevant performance period (the LTIS comparator group).  
The Committee reviews the appropriateness of the 
performance measure and the specific target set when 
considering each new allocation of shares under the LTIS. 
Allocations made prior to May 2001 were subject to  
a performance period of either three or four years (at the 
participant's choice), followed by a retention period of two 
years. Changes to these arrangements were approved at  
the 2001 AGM. Allocations made from May 2001 are released 
to the participant under normal circumstances after the three-
year performance period, provided, and to the extent that,  
the performance conditions have been met. However, prior  
to the release of share allocations, the Committee reviews 
whether the extent to which the performance condition has 
been achieved is a genuine reflection of the Company's 
financial performance. In assessing the extent of satisfaction  
of the performance condition, the Committee uses data 
provided by Alithos Ltd. 
The actual number of shares released to the participant 
depends on the Company's TSR over the performance period 
relative to the LTIS comparator group. The maximum annual 
allocation of shares only vests and is released to the executive 
if the Company's TSR over the performance period is ranked 
in 25th position or above relative to the 99 other companies in 
the LTIS comparator group. No shares vest if the TSR over the 
performance period is ranked below 50th position in the LTIS 
comparator group. Between 25th and 50th position, shares 
vest on a sliding scale from 100% to 40%. 
In April 2005, LTIS allocations equal to 75% of base salary 
were awarded to Executive Directors and, at the same or  
lower rates, to certain other senior executives. The maximum 
number of shares that could be transferred to each Executive 
Director upon satisfaction of the performance conditions 
appears on page 34. 
Subject to shareholder approval at the 2006 AGM,  
it is proposed to introduce a new LTIS pursuant to which 
conditional allocations of shares up to a maximum of 200%  
of base salary may be made to Executive Directors and other 
senior executives. However, the maximum award in 2006 will 
be limited to 150%.  
The release of allocations made under the new LTIS  
will be subject to performance over a three-year period:  
  half of the shares in each allocation will be subject to a 
performance condition based on the Company's growth in 
EPS relative to the growth in RPI. To vest in full, EPS growth 
must exceed RPI growth by 30 percentage points or more 
over the performance period. No part of the award will vest  
if EPS growth fails to exceed RPI growth by at least  
9 percentage points over the performance period. The 
proportion of the award that will vest will increase on a 
straight-line basis between 25% and 100% if EPS growth 
exceeds RPI growth by between 9 and 30 percentage 
points over the performance period; and 
  the other half of the shares in each allocation will be subject 
to a performance condition based on the Company's  
TSR performance relative to the other 99 companies in the 
FTSE 100 on the date of award with vesting reducing on a 
straight-line basis from 100% for upper quintile ranking to 
25% for median-ranking performance. 
  
In order to create a closer alignment with the interests of 
shareholders, the number of shares that are released following  Remuneration Report continued 
 
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 31
the satisfaction of the performance conditions will be increased 
to reflect the dividends that would have been paid during the 
three-year performance period. 
 
Funding of share schemes  
In order to satisfy the release of shares under the LTIS in 2005, 
the trustee of the scheme used shares that had been acquired 
in the market, both prior to and during the year. Newly-issued 
shares were used throughout the year to meet the 
requirements of the ESOS. 
It is the Company's current intention to satisfy the share 
requirements of the above schemes by either acquiring shares 
in the market or, subject to institutional guidelines, using 
shares held in treasury. However, new shares may be used, 
subject to institutional guidelines, if it is in the interests of the 
Company to do so.

The above graph compares the Company's TSR performance 
with that of the FTSE 100 Index for the five years ended  
31 December 2005. 
As required by Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985,  
a rolling definition of the FTSE 100 has been used, whereas 
the definition used for the purposes of the LTIS is the  
FTSE 100 as constituted at the beginning of the period.  
In order to demonstrate the delivery of shareholder value 
during the relevant performance periods, the TSR graphs  
for the LTIS awards that vested in April and October 2005  
are shown on page 34. 
 
Pension 
Executive Directors also participate in a contributory, final 
salary pension scheme (details of which, including the changes 
brought about by the Finance Act 2004, are given on page 36). 
 
Other employment benefits 
In common with other senior management, Executive  
Directors are entitled to a range of benefits, including a 
company car, life assurance, private medical insurance  
and a financial counselling scheme. They are also eligible  
to participate in the Company's HMRC-approved Sharesave 
Scheme and Share Incentive Plan, which are open to all 
eligible employees on the same basis, providing a long-term 
savings and investment opportunity. 
 
Service contracts 
It is the Company's policy that the notice period in Executive 
Directors' service contracts does not exceed one year.  
As permitted by the Code, the Committee retains a level of 
flexibility in order to offer contracts to new Executive Directors 
that contain an initial notice period in excess of one year, 
provided that after the first such period the notice period 
reduces to one year. 
The Executive Directors' service contracts have no fixed term 
but provide that either the Director or the Company may 
terminate the employment by giving one year's written notice 
and that the Company may pay compensation in lieu of notice. 
The dates of the Executive Directors' service contracts are 
set out in the table on page 32. 
It was announced on 15 September 2005 that  
Sir Roy Gardner will retire as the Company's Chief Executive  
in the summer of 2006. In view of his forthcoming retirement, 
Sir Roy Gardner will not participate in any further awards  
under the long-term share-based incentive arrangements. 
Upon retirement, he will be entitled to a pension based on  
his accrued pension entitlement at that date (see page 36)  
and, subject to the relevant rules and performance conditions, 
shares in each of the share incentive arrangements in which  
he participates (see pages 34 and 35). No other payments  
will be made to him. 
 
External appointments of Executive Directors 
The Board believes that experience of other companies' 
practices and challenges is valuable both for the personal 
development of its Executive Directors and for the Company.  
It is therefore the Company's policy to allow each Executive 
Director to accept one non-executive directorship of another 
company, although the Board retains the discretion to vary  
this policy. Fees received in respect of external appointments 
are retained by the individual Director. 
In 2005, Phil Bentley received  52,000 as a Non-Executive 
Director of Kingfisher plc, Mark Clare received  58,500 as  
a Non-Executive Director of BAA plc and Sir Roy Gardner 
received  66,667 as Chairman of Manchester United plc and 
 25,000 as a Non-Executive Director of Compass Group plc  
(a position he accepted after his departure from Manchester 
United plc). 
 
Non-Executive Directors 
Non-Executive Directors including the Chairman do not hold 
service contracts. Their appointment is subject to the Articles 
of Association and the dates they joined the Board are shown 
in the table on page 32. Roger Carr's letter of appointment 
contains a six-month notice period. The fees of the Non-
Executive Directors are approved by the Board, upon the 
recommendation of the Executive Committee, whose 
members are: the Executive Directors (Phil Bentley, Mark Clare, 
Sir Roy Gardner and Jake Ulrich); and four other senior 
executives (Grant Dawson, General Counsel & Company 
Secretary, Deryk King, Managing Director, North America, 
Anne Minto, Group Human Resources Director and Chris 
Weston, Managing Director, British Gas Services). 
Centrica's policy on Non-Executive Directors' fees takes 
into account not only the need to attract individuals of the right 
calibre and experience, but also their responsibilities and time 
commitment, as envisaged in the Code, and the fees paid by 
other companies.  
The current annual fees payable to the Non-Executive 
Directors are:  
 
Chairman  250,000
Other Non-Executive Directors: 
Base fee  50,000
Chairman of Audit Committee  15,000
Chairman of Remuneration Committee  10,000
 
The fees are normally reviewed every two years. The Non-
Executive Directors, including the Chairman, do not participate 
in any of the Company's share schemes, incentive plans or 
pension schemes.  Remuneration Report continued

(i) At the end of the performance period to 1 October 2003, the Company ranked fortieth in the relevant comparator group. 
Accordingly, 75% of the original allocations were released following the expiry of the two-year retention period. 
(ii) At the end of the performance period to 1 April 2005, the Company ranked thirty-ninth in the relevant comparator group. 
Accordingly, 76.7% of the original allocations were released to participants. 
(iii) The released shares were subject to income tax at the individual's marginal rate and National Insurance contributions (NICs) 
at the rate of 1%, based on the market value of the shares at the date of vesting. The income tax and NICs liability was 
satisfied by the sale of sufficient shares and, accordingly, the Executive Directors only received the net number of shares 
following disposal, which, to the extent retained, is reflected in the shareholdings as at 31 December 2005 on page 33. 
(iv) At the end of the performance period the Company's TSR performance will be assessed against that of the relevant LTIS 
comparator group. If, and to the extent that, the performance conditions are met, the relevant number of shares will be 
released to the Directors at the Trustee's discretion as soon as practicable thereafter. 
(v) The vesting date was 3 October 2005 in relation to the 2000 allocation and 7 April 2005 in relation to the 2002 allocation.

Directors' pensions 
The pension arrangements for the Executive Directors, all of whom are now members of the Centrica Management Pension 
Scheme, are shown below. The Centrica Management Pension Scheme is a funded, HMRC-approved, final salary, occupational 
pension scheme. Its rules provide for the following main features: 
  normal retirement at age 62; 
  right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service after age 60 at own request with employer consent, or on 
leaving service at the Company's request after age 55;  
  life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary for death in service; 
  spouse's pension on death in service payable at the rate of 50% of the member's prospective pension and, on death after 
retirement, half of the accrued pension. Children's pensions are also payable; 
  members' contributions payable at the rate of 6% of pensionable earnings; 
  pension payable in the event of retirement due to ill health; 
  pensions in payment and in deferment guaranteed to increase in line with the increase in the RPI (a maximum of 6% applies 
to pension accrued after 6 April 2004); and 
  no discretionary practices are taken into account in calculating transfer values. 
 
All benefits are subject to HMRC limits and the Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme (CUPS) provides benefits on the salary  
in excess of the earnings cap to the level that would otherwise have been paid by the approved scheme. The benefits that  
arise under this are treated as being subject to the same rules as apply in respect of the approved portion of members' benefits.  
No individual will receive benefits from Centrica which, when added to their retained benefits elsewhere, exceed two-thirds  
of their final pensionable earnings. CUPS is unfunded but the benefits are secured by a charge over certain Centrica assets.  
An appropriate provision in respect of their accrued value has been made in the Company's balance sheet.  
 
Finance Act 2004 
As a result of the changes brought about by the Finance Act 2004, Centrica intends to maximise the scope within the new  
Life Time Allowance (LTA) of  1.5 million, by delivering some of the benefits currently provided via CUPS through the approved 
arrangement, the Centrica Management Pension Scheme. Centrica will not however transfer any CUPS liabilities in excess of  
this Allowance which would result in a higher tax rate being paid on the benefits. With effect from 6 April 2006, the contributions 
made by members of CUPS will not be restricted to the maximum rate of 15% of the earnings cap and from that date their 
contributions will be based at the rate of 6% of their total pensionable earnings.

(i) Accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age 62, based on eligible service to 31 December 2005. 
(ii) The increase in accrued pension has been adjusted to exclude inflation by revaluing the figure in the second column by the 
rate of inflation (2.7% - see note iv) and deducting this from the figure in the first column. 
(iii) Member contributions paid in the year were restricted to the maximum rate of 15% of the earnings  cap'. 
(iv) The rate of inflation used was 2.7%, the annual rate to 30 September 2005, the date used for pension increases under  
the scheme. The actual transfer value of the increase in accrued pension at 31 December 2005 excludes inflation. 
(v) The pension accrual rates applicable in the Centrica Management Pension Scheme for Phil Bentley, Mark Clare,  
Sir Roy Gardner and Jake Ulrich were, respectively, 2.65%, 2.46%, 4.11% and 3.71% of pensionable earnings for each year 
of pensionable employment. 
(vi) Jake Ulrich was appointed to the Board of Directors with effect from 1 January 2005.
