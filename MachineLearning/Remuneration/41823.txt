Remuneration Report

Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee 
During 2006, the Remuneration Committee comprised Helen 
Alexander (Chairman), Mary Francis, Paul Rayner, Paul Walsh  
and, from 21 February, Andrew Mackenzie. Patricia Mann was  
a member of the Committee until 19 May and, by way of early 
adoption of the 2006 revision to the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance (the  Code'), Roger Carr was a member from 26 July. 
The Committee met seven times during 2006. The Remuneration 
Committee's terms of reference are available at www.centrica.com.  
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board, within 
formal terms of reference, on the policy and framework of executive 
remuneration and its cost to the Company. The Committee is also 
responsible for the implementation of remuneration policy and 
determining specific remuneration packages for each of the 
Executive Directors. It has access to the advice and views of the 
Group Reward Director (Cathy Aldwinckle), the Group Human 
Resources Director (Anne Minto), the General Counsel & Company 
Secretary (Grant Dawson), the Chief Executive (Sam Laidlaw, who 
replaced Sir Roy Gardner in July 2006) and external consultants.  
During the year, Kepler Associates (Kepler) acted as 
independent executive remuneration adviser to the Company  
and the Committee, having been formally appointed in 2005. The 
Committee also consulted, but did not formally appoint, Towers 
Perrin. Both remuneration consultants provided advice on 
executive compensation to assist in the formulation of the 
Committee's recommendations. 
This report, which will be submitted to the forthcoming AGM 
for approval, explains how the Company has applied the principles 
of the Code that relate to Directors' remuneration during the year. 
No Director is involved in the determination of, or votes on any 
matter relating to, his or her own remuneration. 
Executive Directors' remuneration policy and framework 
It is the role of the Committee to ensure that the Group's 
remuneration policy and framework provides competitive reward 
for its Executive Directors and other senior executives, taking into 
account the Company's performance, the markets in which it 
operates and pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group. 
In constructing the remuneration packages, the Committee 
aims to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and variable 
compensation for each executive. Accordingly, a significant proportion 
of the remuneration package depends on the attainment of 
demanding performance objectives, both short- and long-term. 
The annual bonus scheme is designed to incentivise and reward 
the achievement of demanding financial and business related 
objectives. Long-term share-based incentives are designed to align 
the interests of Executive Directors and other senior executives 
with the longer-term interests of shareholders by rewarding them 
for delivering sustained increased shareholder value.  
In agreeing the level of base salaries and the performance-
related elements of the remuneration package, the Committee 
considers the potential maximum remuneration that executives 
could receive. The Committee reviews the packages and varies 
individual elements when appropriate from year to year. 
The Committee, assisted by Kepler and the internal advisers 
named above, conducted a thorough review of the Group's 
executive incentive arrangements in late 2005 and early 2006.  
The purpose of this review was to ensure that the incentive 
arrangements: provided a strong alignment with the delivery of 
value to shareholders; reflected current best practice, while 
meeting the Group's particular business needs; and would enable 
the Group to continue to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre 
management in a highly-challenging business environment. 
Following this review, the Committee proposed changes  
to the future policy and framework of executive remuneration 
arrangements in line with the above objectives and these were 
endorsed by shareholders upon the approval of new share-based 
incentive schemes at the 2006 AGM.  
In 2006, executive remuneration comprised base salary, 
annual performance bonus, an allocation of shares under the new 
Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS), which was approved at the 
2006 AGM and, as part of the transitional arrangements to the new 
policy, a grant of options in April under the Executive Share Option 
Scheme (ESOS). In 2007, executive remuneration will comprise the 
above, but participation in the new Deferred and Matching Share 
Scheme (DMSS), based on the annual performance bonus in 
respect of 2006, will replace the ESOS. 
No further ESOS grants will be made on a regular basis, 
although the Committee will retain the discretion to make grants 
under the ESOS in the future if there are exceptional circumstances 
in which it considers it appropriate to do so. 
As a result of the changes under the new policy, the Committee 
expects that total remuneration for median performance will remain 
unchanged, but that total remuneration for upper quartile 
performance will be increased in line with market practice. 
A minimum shareholding policy requires the retention of a value 
of shares as follows: the Chief Executive - twice his base salary; all 
other Executive Directors - 1.25 times their base salary; and those 
senior executives immediately below Board level - base salary. 
The Centrica Management Pension Scheme (a contributory 
final salary arrangement) was closed to new employees on 30 June 
2003. Executive Directors in office prior to this date participated in 
that scheme during 2006. Alternative arrangements are made for 
new employees, including Executive Directors, after that date. Full 
disclosure of the pension arrangements for the Executive Directors 
are given on page 41. 
The Committee believes that these arrangements, which are 
further explained below, are important in providing a potential 
remuneration package that will attract, retain and continue to 
motivate Executive Directors and other senior executives in a 
marketplace that is challenging and competitive in both commercial 
and human resource terms. It is intended that this remuneration 
policy and framework, which is fully endorsed by the Board, will 
continue for 2007 and succeeding years. 
In 2006, the total compensation of the Executive  
Directors, detailed on page 37, consisted of components  
in the following proportions:

Note: Salary and benefits are the actual amounts received during 2006; other payments 
include an initial payment and salary supplement in lieu of pension paid to Sam Laidlaw -  
see page 41; pension, for those directors in the Centrica Management Pension Scheme,  
is the increase in actual transfer value for 2006 over the notional transfer value for 2005 less 
the Director's contributions during 2006; pension for Sam Laidlaw is the actual amount  
of the contribution made by the Company to his personal pension; performance bonus  
is that payable in respect of 2006; and ESOS and LTIS are the estimated value, based  
on a Black-Scholes model, of the awards made in 2006, provided that all performance 
conditions are met in full at the end of the relevant performance periods.  Directors' Report - Business Review p05 Directors' Report - Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

Components of remuneration 
Base salary 
The Committee seeks to establish a base salary for each Executive 
Director and other senior executives, determined by individual 
performance and having regard to market salary levels for similar 
positions in comparable companies derived from independent 
sources. Base salaries are reviewed annually. Base salary is the 
only element of remuneration that is pensionable. 
Annual performance bonus 
At the beginning of each year, the Committee reviews the annual 
performance bonus scheme to ensure that it remains competitive 
in the marketplace, continues to incentivise the Executive Directors 
and other senior executives and aligns their interests with those of 
shareholders. For 2006, the maximum bonus payable to Executive 
Directors, should every element of every objective be achieved in 
full, was 125% of base salary. The maximum bonus payable to 
other senior executives immediately below Board level, assuming 
all objectives are achieved in full, ranges between 100% and 
125%. In 2006, the maximum achievable bonus related to financial 
performance targets and business-related targets split, 64% and 
36% respectively for Executive Directors and 60% and 40% 
respectively for executives immediately below Board level. 20%  
of any annual bonus paid in 2007 will be deferred automatically  
and invested in the DMSS (see below). In line with current policy,  
a bonus will be forfeited if overall performance is deemed to 
Deferred and Matching Share Scheme (DMSS) 
The initial award under the DMSS will be made in 2007 based  
on the 2006 annual bonus. 20% of the annual bonus payable to 
Executive Directors and other senior executives will be deferred 
automatically for a period of three years and invested in Centrica 
shares (deferred shares), during which time they cannot be 
withdrawn. Participants may elect to invest an additional amount 
in Centrica shares (investment shares) to be funded from actual 
bonus payable or the release of LTIS shares only which, when 
added to the value of the deferred shares, will bring the total 
amount invested up to 50% of the individual's maximum bonus 
entitlement in respect of the preceding year. Deferred and 
investment shares will be matched with conditional shares 
(matching shares), which will be released upon the achievement, 
over a three-year period, of demanding three-year cumulative 
group economic profit performance targets. The number of 
matching shares that vest will be determined on a straight-line 
basis from a zero match for no growth in economic profit to  
a two-times match for growth of 25% or above. To provide a  
closer alignment with the interests of shareholders, the number of 
matching shares that are released following the satisfaction of the 
performance condition will be increased to reflect the dividends 
that would have been paid during the three-year performance 
period. In the event of a change of control the number of matching 
shares that vest will be subject to time apportionment in line with 
best practice. 
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) 
As part of the transitional arrangements from the old remuneration 
policy adopted in 2001 and the new policy as outlined above and 
adopted in 2006, a grant of options was made in April, equal to 
200% of base salary and, at the same or lower rates, to certain 
other senior executives. Details of options granted to Executive 
Directors are shown on page 40.  
If, and to the extent that, performance conditions are satisfied, 
options normally become exercisable three years after the date of 
grant and remain so until the tenth anniversary of grant. Performance 
conditions are based on the extent to which growth in the 
Company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS growth) exceeds 
growth in the Retail Prices Index (RPI growth) over a three-year 
performance period. 
In respect of each grant of options, the Committee has 
determined that, for the option to be exercisable in full, EPS growth 
must exceed RPI growth by 18 percentage points or more over the 
three-year performance period. No part of the option grant will be 
exercisable if EPS growth fails to exceed RPI growth by at least  
9 percentage points over the performance period. The proportion 
of the option grant exercisable by the executive will increase on a 
sliding scale between 40% and 100% if EPS growth exceeds RPI 
growth by between 9 and 18 percentage points over the 
performance period. 
Options granted from 2001 to March 2004 under the ESOS 
permitted the Company's EPS to be measured annually for a 
further two years from the date of grant of the options, with the 
performance conditions increasing proportionately. Having 
reviewed market practice regarding the retesting of performance 
measures, the Committee removed this element in respect of all 
option grants from September 2004.  
Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS) 
Following shareholder approval at the 2006 AGM, a new LTIS was 
introduced pursuant to which conditional allocations of shares up 
to a maximum of 200% of base salary may be made to Executive 
Directors and other senior executives.  
In 2006, LTIS allocations equal to 150% of base salary were 
awarded to Executive Directors and, at lower rates, to certain other 
senior executives. The maximum number of shares that could be 
transferred to each Executive Director upon satisfaction of the 
performance conditions in full appears on page 39. 
The release of allocations will be subject to performance 
conditions over a three-year period:  
 half the shares in each allocation are subject to a performance 
condition based on the Company's EPS growth relative to the 
growth in RPI. To vest in full, EPS growth must exceed RPI 
growth by 30 percentage points or more over the performance 
period. No part of the award will vest if EPS growth fails to 
exceed RPI growth by at least 9 percentage points over the 
performance period. The proportion of the award that will vest 
will increase on a straight-line basis between 25% and 100%  
if EPS growth exceeds RPI growth by between 9 and 30 
percentage points over the performance period; and 
 the other half of the shares in each allocation are subject  
to a performance condition based on the Company's Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) performance relative to the other 99 
companies in the FTSE 100 on the date of award with vesting 
reducing on a straight-line basis from 100% for upper quintile 
ranking to 25% for median ranking performance. 
To create a closer alignment with the interests of shareholders, 
the number of shares that are released following the satisfaction of 
the performance conditions will be increased to reflect the dividends 
that would have been paid during the three-year performance period. 
In the event of a change of control the number of shares that vest 
will be subject to time apportionment in line with best practice.

Prior to 2006, allocations of shares were made annually to Executive 
Directors and other senior executives under the old LTIS, in 
accordance with the remuneration policy adopted in 2001.  
Such allocations are released to the participant under normal 
circumstances after the three-year performance period, provided, 
and to the extent that, the performance conditions have been met. 
The actual number of shares released to the participant 
depends on the Company's TSR over the performance period 
relative to the LTIS comparator group. The maximum annual 
allocation of shares only vests and is released to the executive if 
the Company's TSR over the performance period is ranked in 25th 
position or above relative to the 99 other companies in the LTIS 
comparator group. No shares vest if the TSR over the performance 
period is ranked below 50th position in the LTIS comparator group. 
Between 25th and 50th position, shares vest on a sliding scale 
from 100% to 40%. 
The Committee has determined that, for the pre 2006 LTIS 
and for that part of the new LTIS subject to the comparative TSR 
performance conditions, the most appropriate comparator group 
for the Company is the companies comprising the FTSE 100 at the 
start of the relevant performance period (the LTIS comparator group). 
The Committee reviews the appropriateness of the performance 
measures and the specific targets set when considering each new 
allocation of shares under the LTIS. 
Prior to the release of share allocations under both the old  
and new LTIS arrangements, the Committee reviews whether the 
extent to which the performance conditions have been achieved is 
a genuine reflection of the Company's financial performance. In 
assessing the extent of satisfaction of the performance conditions, 
the Committee uses data provided by Alithos Ltd (an independent 
third party) in respect of comparative TSR and audited figures in 
respect of adjusted EPS. 
Performance conditions under IFRS 
Following the adoption of IFRS in 2005, the Committee agreed, 
having taken advice from Kepler and having consulted with the ABI 
and the RREV, to continue with the financial target of economic 
profit in respect of the annual performance bonus and new DMSS 
and EPS in respect of the ESOS and the new LTIS, subject to 
certain adjustments to the figures calculated in accordance with 
IFRS. It was agreed that for the purposes of determining 
performance in respect of those schemes the relevant figures 
produced under IFRS should be adjusted for exceptional items  
and certain re-measurements arising on the application of IAS 32 
and IAS 39.

The above table compares the Company's TSR performance  
with that of the FTSE 100 Index for the five years ended  
31 December 2006. 
As required by Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985, a rolling 
definition of the FTSE 100 has been used, whereas the definition 
used for the purposes of the LTIS is the FTSE 100 as constituted 
at the beginning of the period. In order to demonstrate the delivery 
of shareholder value during the relevant performance period, the 
TSR graph for the LTIS award that vested in April 2006 is shown 
on page 39. 
Funding of share schemes  
In order to satisfy the release of shares under the LTIS and meet the 
requirements of the ESOS in 2006 newly-issued shares were used. 
It is the Company's current intention to satisfy the requirements  
of its share schemes, in a method best suited to the interests of  
the Company, either by acquiring shares in the market or, subject 
to institutional guidelines, issuing new shares or using shares held 
in treasury. 
Pension 
The pension arrangements of the Executive Directors are fully 
disclosed on page 41. 
Other employment benefits 
In common with other senior management, Executive Directors  
are entitled to a range of benefits, including a company car, life 
assurance, private medical insurance and a financial counselling 
scheme. Such benefits are subject to financial limits as set out in 
appropriate policies. They are also eligible to participate in the 
Company's HMRC-approved Sharesave Scheme and Share 
Incentive Plan, which are open to all eligible employees on the same 
basis, providing a long-term savings and investment opportunity. 
Service contracts 
It is the Company's policy that the notice period in Executive 
Directors' service contracts does not exceed one year. The 
Executive Directors' service contracts have no fixed term but 
provide that either the Director or the Company may terminate  
the employment by giving one year's written notice and that the 
Company may pay compensation in lieu of notice.  
In the case of new external appointments to the Board, the 
Committee retains a level of flexibility, as permitted by the Code,  
in order to attract and retain suitable candidates. It therefore 
reserves the right to offer contracts which contain an initial notice 
period in excess of one year, provided that after the first such 
period the notice reduces to one year. The Committee exercised 
this discretion in respect of the appointment of Sam Laidlaw, 
whose service contract allows for an initial notice period of two 
years. His notice period will reduce to one year in July 2008.  
The dates of the Executive Directors' service contracts are  
set out in the table on page 37. 
External appointments of Executive Directors 
The Board believes that experience of other companies' practices 
and challenges is valuable both for the personal development of  
its Executive Directors and for the Company. It is therefore the 
Company's policy to allow each Executive Director to accept one 
non-executive directorship of another company, although the Board 
retains the discretion to vary this policy. Fees received in respect of 
external appointments are retained by the individual Director.  Directors' Report - Business Review p05 Directors' Report - Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

In 2006, Phil Bentley received  57,417 as a Non-Executive Director 
of Kingfisher plc, and in respect of the period they were a director 
of the Company, Sam Laidlaw received  29,000 as a Non-
Executive Director of Hanson plc, Mark Clare received  28,250 as 
a Non-Executive Director of BAA plc and Sir Roy Gardner received 
 50,000 as a Non-Executive Director of Compass Group plc. 
Non-Executive Directors 
Non-Executive Directors including the Chairman do not hold 
service contracts. Their appointment is subject to the Articles  
of Association and the dates they joined the Board are shown  
in the table below. Roger Carr's letter of appointment contains  
a six-month notice period. The fees of the Non-Executive Directors 
are approved by the Board upon the recommendation of the 
Executive Committee, whose members are: the Executive Directors 
(Sam Laidlaw, Phil Bentley and Jake Ulrich); and four other senior 
executives (Grant Dawson, General Counsel & Company Secretary; 
Deryk King, Managing Director, North America; Anne Minto, Group 
Human Resources Director; and Chris Weston, Managing Director, 
British Gas Services). 
Centrica's policy on Non-Executive Directors' fees takes into 
account the need to attract individuals of the right calibre and  
experience, their responsibilities and time commitment, as 
envisaged in the Code, and the fees paid by other companies. 
The current annual fees payable to the Non-Executive 
Directors are:  
The fees are normally reviewed every two years. The Non-Executive 
Directors, including the Chairman, do not participate in any of the 
Company's share schemes, incentive plans or pension schemes. 
The Remuneration Report from page 34 to page 37 up to this 
statement has not been audited. From this point until the end of 
the report on page 41, the disclosures, with the exception of the 
graph on page 39, have been audited by the Company's auditors,

of employee share trusts for the purposes of the LTIS and the Share Incentive Plan. As with other employees, the Directors are  
deemed to have a potential interest in those shares, being beneficiaries under the trust. As at 21 February 2007, 12,255 shares  
and 12,371 shares were held by the respective trustees. 
From 1 January 2006 to 22 February 2007, none of the Directors had any beneficial interests in the Company's securities  
other than ordinary shares, nor any non-beneficial interests in any of the Company's securities, nor in those of its subsidiary  
or associated undertakings.  Directors' Report - Business Review p05 Directors' Report - Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

(i) At the end of the performance period to 1 April 2006, the Company ranked 40th in the relevant comparator group. Accordingly,  
75% of the original allocations were released to participants on 6 April 2006. The released shares were subject to income tax at the 
individual's marginal rate and National Insurance contributions (NICs) at the rate of 1%, based on the market value of the shares at 
the date of vesting. The income tax and NICs liability was satisfied by the sale of sufficient shares and, accordingly, the Executive 
Directors only received the net number of shares following disposal, which, to the extent retained, is reflected in the shareholdings  
as at 31 December 2006 on page 38. 
(ii) At the end of the performance period the Company's TSR performance will be assessed against that of the relevant LTIS comparator 
group. If, and to the extent that, the performance conditions are met, the relevant number of shares will be released to the Directors 
at the Trustee's discretion as soon as practicable thereafter. 
(iii) The percentage of the allocation eventually to vest is dependent on the satisfaction of performance criteria over a three-year 
performance period: half of the shares (EPS shares) will be subject to a performance condition based on Centrica's EPS growth 
relative to the growth in RPI (All Items) over three financial years. EPS growth will be calculated by comparing the Company's 
adjusted EPS figure for the financial period preceding the date of allocation with that for the financial period three years later; and  
half of the shares will be determined by the Company's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance relative to the other companies 
comprising the LTIS comparator group - the FTSE 100 at the start of the three-year performance period (the TSR shares). At the  
end of the performance period, the TSR performance condition will be measured, the same calculation made for all the other 99 
companies in the LTIS comparator group and a ranking list will be compiled. 
(iv) Following the resignation of Mark Clare on 30 September 2006, his LTIS awards made on 1 April 2004, 1 April 2005 and 3 April 2006 
were automatically forfeited. 
(v) Sir Roy Gardner did not receive an award of LTIS in 2006 due to his impending retirement. Having retired on 30 June 2006 the LTIS 
allocations made to him on 1 April 2004 and 1 April 2005 will be transferred at the end of their respective performance periods, 
subject to the achievement of performance conditions and they will be time-apportioned in accordance with the rules of the LTIS. 
(vi) As explained in the Notice of Meeting to convene the AGM held on 19 May 2006 (at which approval was sought and given by 
shareholders in respect of the new LTIS) the first awards under the new LTIS were made to participants other than the Executive 
Directors on 3 April 2006 (on the date that allocations would normally be made under the previous LTIS and within the 42 day period 
following the release of the Company's annual results). The awards to the Executive Directors then in office could only be made after 
shareholder approval, but in order to align their awards with those of other participants, their first awards were deemed to have been 
made on 3 April 2006 for all purposes of the new LTIS, including the calculation of the number of shares, the adjusted EPS and 
relative TSR performance tests and the three-year vesting period.

18 March 2004, 1 April 2005 and 3 April 2006. Details of the operation of the scheme are provided on page 35. 
(ii) Sharesave Scheme  
The Company operates an HMRC-approved all-employee savings-related share option scheme in the UK. The scheme is designed 
to provide a long-term savings and investment opportunity for employees. 
(iii) Mark Clare 
Mark Clare resigned on 30 September 2006. In accordance with the rules of the ESOS his outstanding options at this date lapsed.  
In accordance with the rules of the Sharesave his outstanding Sharesave option is exercisable within 6 months of his leave date as 
the options had been held for more than three years at the date of resignation. Mark Clare may only exercise those options to the 
extent of the savings made and interest due. 
(iv) Sir Roy Gardner 
Sir Roy Gardner retired on 30 June 2006. In accordance with the rules of the ESOS he exercised all his options except for those 
granted in 2005 which had not met the relevant performance conditions. Under the rules of the Sharesave, he was able to exercise 
his options to the extent of the savings made and interest due. 
The closing price of a Centrica ordinary share on the last trading day of 2006 (29 December) was 354.50 pence. The range during the 
year was 248.25 pence (low) and 359.75 pence (high).  Directors' Report - Business Review p05 Directors' Report - Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

Directors' pensions 
The pension arrangements for the Executive Directors all of whom are members of the Centrica Management Pension Scheme, are 
shown below (with the exception of the Sam Laidlaw who joined the Company during the year and is not a member of any of Centrica's 
pension schemes). The Centrica Management Pension Scheme is a funded, HMRC-registered, final salary, occupational pension scheme. 
Its rules provide for the following main features: 
 normal retirement at age 62 (see note on normal retirement age below); 
 right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service after age 60 at own request with employer consent, or on leaving service 
at Company's request after age 55;  
 life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary for death in service; 
 spouse's pension on death in service payable at the rate of 50% of the member's prospective pension and, on death after retirement, 
half of the accrued pension. Children's pensions are also payable; 
 members' contributions payable at the rate of 6% of pensionable earnings; 
 pension payable in the event of retirement due to ill health; 
 pensions in payment and in deferment guaranteed to increase in line with the increase in the RPI (a maximum of 6% applies to pension 
accrued after 6 April 2004); and 
 no discretionary practices are taken into account in calculating transfer values. 
All registered scheme benefits are subject to HMRC limits. Where these limits would restrict the pension promise due the Centrica 
Unapproved Pension Scheme (CUPS) provides benefits on the salary in excess of the Scheme earnings cap to the level that would otherwise 
have been paid by the registered scheme. The benefits that arise under this are treated as being subject to the same rules as apply in respect 
of the registered portion of members' benefits. No individual will receive benefits from Centrica which, when added to their retained benefits 
elsewhere, exceed two-thirds of their final pensionable earnings. CUPS is unfunded but the benefits are secured by a charge over certain 
Centrica assets. An appropriate provision in respect of their accrued value has been made in the Company's balance sheet.  
Finance Act 2004 
As a result of the changes brought about by the Finance Act 2004, Centrica transferred a portion of the unregistered element of Executive 
Directors' pension benefits in CUPS to the registered Centrica Management Pension Scheme, thereby delivering some of the benefits 
previously provided via CUPS through the registered arrangement, up to the new Lifetime Allowance (LTA). Centrica did not however 
transfer any CUPS liabilities in excess of the LTA, which would have resulted in a higher tax rate being paid on the value of the benefits at 
5 April 2006. With effect from 6 April 2006, the contributions made by the Executive Directors are not restricted to the rate of 15% of the 
earnings cap and are based on the rate of 6% of their total pensionable earnings.

(i) Accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age 62, based on eligible service to and pensionable salary at  
31 December 2006, with the exception of the values shown for Sir Roy Gardner and Mark Clare, which represent the total of their 
accrued pension at their dates of leaving of 30 June 2006 and 30 September 2006 respectively. The pension accrual rates for 2006  
as a percentage of pensionable salary are as follows for Phil Bentley, Mark Clare, Sir Roy Gardner and Jake Ulrich were 2.65%, 
2.46%, 4.11% and 3.71% respectively. 
(ii) The increase in accrued pension has been adjusted to exclude inflation by revaluing the accrued pension as at 31 December 2005  
by the rate of inflation (3.6%) and deducting this from the accrued pension as at 31 December 2006. The rate of inflation used was 
3.6%, the annual rate to 30 September 2006, the date used for pension increases under the scheme. 
(iii) Sir Roy Gardner retired on 30 June 2006. The transfer value as at 31 December 2006 includes an uplift of  1,062,100 as a result of  
a change in the method of calculation of the transfer value for pensioners which did not apply at 31 December 2005 when he was still 
in service.  
(iv) Member contributions paid in the year were restricted to the maximum rate of 15% of the earnings  cap' up to 5 April 2006.  
This restriction was removed from 6 April 2006 so that contributions were deducted against total uncapped pensionable salary. 
Sam Laidlaw does not participate in the Centrica pension scheme. Under the terms of his contract of employment, he is entitled to a 
salary supplement of 40% of base salary in lieu of any pension provisions. On joining the Company, a payment of  215,000 was made to 
his personal pension arrangements.  
This report on remuneration has been approved by the Board of Directors and signed on its behalf by:
