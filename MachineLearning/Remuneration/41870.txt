Remuneration  
Report  
Governance 
continued 
This report details the Company's executive remuneration policy 
and includes information on the remuneration of the Directors for 
the financial year ended 31 December 2008. 
Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee 
Throughout 2008, the Remuneration Committee comprised  
Helen Alexander (Chairman), Roger Carr, Mary Francis, Andrew 
Mackenzie, Paul Rayner and Paul Walsh. The Committee  
met five times during the year. The formal terms of reference  
were reviewed during the year and are available on the  
Company's website. 
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board,  
within formal terms of reference, on the policy and framework  
of executive remuneration and its cost to the Company.  
The Committee is also responsible for the implementation of 
remuneration policy and determining specific remuneration 
packages for each of the Executive Directors. It has access to  
the advice and views of the Group Human Resources Director,  
the Group Reward Director, the Chief Executive, the General 
Counsel & Company Secretary and external consultants.  
At its meetings in 2008, the Committee considered, amongst  
other things, the following: 
 the 2007 Remuneration Report; 
 achievement of performance targets in respect of the 2007 
Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS) and the vesting of existing 
awards made under the long-term share-based incentive 
arrangements; 
 levels of base salary; 
 setting award levels and performance targets in respect of the 
2008 AIS and awards made under the long-term share-based 
incentive arrangements; 
 proposed terms of appointment of the new Managing Director 
Centrica Energy and Europe;  
 effectiveness of the AIS;  
 changes to the eligibility criteria of the Sharesave Scheme; and 
 the impact of the extended prohibited period for dealing in 
shares and the subsequent Rights Issue on the operation of the 
Group's Share Schemes. 
During the year, Kepler Associates (Kepler) acted as independent 
executive remuneration adviser to the Committee, having been 
formally appointed in 2005. Kepler provided advice on executive 
compensation to assist in the formulation of the Committee's 
recommendations. The Committee also consulted, but did not 
formally appoint, Towers Perrin.  
This report, which will be submitted to the forthcoming AGM for 
approval, explains how the Company has applied the principles  
of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code) that 
relate to Directors' remuneration during the year. No Director is 
involved in the determination of, or votes on, any matter relating  
to his or her own remuneration. 
Executive Directors' remuneration policy and framework 
It is the role of the Committee to ensure that the Group's 
remuneration policy and framework provides competitive reward 
for its Executive Directors and other senior executives, taking into 
account among other things, the Company's performance, the 
markets in which it operates and pay and conditions elsewhere in 
the Group. 
In constructing the remuneration packages, the Committee aims  
to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and variable 
compensation for each executive. Accordingly, a significant 
proportion of the remuneration package depends on the 
attainment of demanding performance objectives, both short  
and long term. The AIS is designed to incentivise and reward  
the achievement of demanding financial and business-related 
objectives. Long-term share-based incentives are designed  
to align the interests of Executive Directors and other senior 
executives with the longer-term interests of Centrica's 
shareholders by rewarding them for delivering sustained,  
increased shareholder value.  
The Committee reviews the packages and varies individual 
elements when appropriate from year to year. Those reviews are 
conducted with the assistance of Kepler and the internal advisers 
to: ensure that the remuneration arrangements continue to provide 
a strong alignment with the achievement of strategic objectives 
and the delivery of value to shareholders; reflect current best 
practice, while meeting the Group's particular business needs;  
and enable the Group to continue to attract and retain high calibre 
management in a highly challenging business environment. In 
agreeing the level of base salaries and the performance-related 
elements of the remuneration package, the Committee considers 
the potential maximum remuneration that executives could receive. 
The Committee recently conducted a review against the above 
criteria and proposed changes to the future policy and framework 
of executive remuneration arrangements and, in particular, 
consulted with a number of major shareholders regarding changes 
to the operation of the AIS and Deferred and Matching Share 
Scheme (DMSS) going forward, as outlined later in this report. 
These changes become effective during 2009. 
In 2008, executive remuneration comprised base salary, AIS, an 
allocation of shares under the Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS), 
and an allocation of shares under the DMSS. No Executive Share 
Option Scheme (ESOS) grants were made during the year, 
although the Committee retains the discretion to make grants 
under the ESOS in the future if there are exceptional 
circumstances in which it considers it is appropriate to do so.  
A one-off allocation of shares under the Special Long Term 
Incentive Scheme (SLTIS) and a grant of options under the Special 
Executive Share Option Scheme (SESOS) were made to Mark 
Hanafin in accordance with the terms of his engagement. 
A minimum shareholding policy requires the retention of a value  
of shares as follows: the Chief Executive - twice his base salary;  
all other Executive Directors - 1.25 times their base salary;  
and, executives immediately below Board level - base salary. 
Achievement against this requirement for Executive Directors  
is set out in the table on page 51.

Directors' Report - Business Review Directors' Report - Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
 
The Centrica Pension Plan (CPP) which was formerly known as the 
Centrica Management Pension Scheme (CMPS) (a contributory 
final salary arrangement) was closed to new employees on  
30 June 2003. Phil Bentley and Jake Ulrich, having been 
employed prior to this date participated in the scheme during 
2008. Alternative arrangements are made for new employees, 
including Executive Directors, after the closing date referred to 
above. Full disclosure of the pension arrangements for the 
Executive Directors is given on page 55. 
The Committee believes that these arrangements, which are 
further explained below, are important in providing a potential 
remuneration package that will attract, retain and continue to 
motivate Executive Directors and other senior executives in  
a marketplace that is challenging and competitive in both 
commercial and human resource terms. It is currently intended 
that this remuneration policy and framework, which is fully 
endorsed by the Board, will continue for 2009. 
In 2008, the total emoluments of the Executive Directors, detailed 
on page 50, consisted of components in the following proportions: 
Relative proportions of the components of each Executive 
Director's remuneration (%) in 2008 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note: Salary and benefits are the actual amounts received during 2008, in the case of Mark 
Hanafin since 14 July 2008, his date of appointment; AIS is that paid in respect of 2008 as 
reflected in the emoluments table on page 50; additional payments include interest payments  
as a result of the delayed operation of the DMSS; a salary supplement in lieu of pension paid  
to Mark Hanafin, Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff; a cash payment to Mark Hanafin in lieu of bonus 
payable by his previous employer and a payment to Nick Luff in lieu of provision of a company 
car - see page 50; DMSS and LTIS are the estimated value in accordance with note 2 to the 
Financial Statements on pages 62 to 71, of the awards made in 2008, provided that all 
performance conditions are met in full at the end of the relevant performance periods; and 
pension, for Phil Bentley and Jake Ulrich in the Centrica Pension Plan (CPP), is the increase in 
actual transfer value for 2008 over the notional transfer value for 2007 less the Director's 
contributions during 2008; pension for Sam Laidlaw is the actual amount of the contribution made 
by the Company to his personal pension. 
The total emoluments of the five senior executives immediately 
below Board level for 2008, calculated on the same basis as  
the emoluments of the Executive Directors detailed on page 50,  
fell into the following bands: 
Bands  000  Number of senior executives
900 - 1,000 1
800 - 899 1
700 - 799 -
600 - 699 2
500 - 599  -
400 - 499 1
 
Components of remuneration 
Base salary 
The Committee establishes a base salary for each Executive 
Director and other senior executives, determined by individual 
performance and having regard to market salary levels for similar 
positions in comparable companies based on information from 
independent sources. Base salaries are reviewed annually. In 
respect of 2009 it has been decided that no base salary increases 
will be awarded to the Executive Directors or to other members  
of the senior management team except where individuals have 
had a significant change to their responsibilities. For members  
of CPP, base salary is the only element of remuneration that  
is pensionable. 
Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS) 
At the beginning of each year, the Committee reviews the AIS to 
ensure that it remains competitive in the marketplace, continues  
to incentivise the Executive Directors and other senior executives 
and aligns their interests with those of Centrica's shareholders. For 
2008, the target and maximum bonus opportunity, together with 
the relative proportions of the components that made up the 
maximum bonus opportunity, were as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As shown in the chart above, a balanced range of measures is 
used to determine overall AIS performance. In 2008, the primary 
financial measure was Group Economic Profit (EP). In addition, 
each Business Unit had a number of business metrics focusing  
on  their key strategic priorities for the year. Example metrics 
include cost reduction targets, project completion and customer 
satisfaction levels. The Committee will also take into consideration 
performance in relation to corporate responsibility including health, 
safety and environmental matters when determining the level of 
bonuses to be paid. In line with current policy, a bonus will be 
forfeited if overall performance is deemed to be unsatisfactory.  
Twenty per cent of annual bonuses paid in respect of 2006 and 
2007 were deferred automatically and invested in the DMSS (see 
pages 46 and 47). To incentivise Executive Directors to focus on 
creating long-term value for shareholders and to deliver sustained 
high performance, the deferral in respect of 2008 and thereafter 
will increase from 20% to 40% of any AIS award for the Chief 
Executive and to 30% for Executive Directors and executives 
immediately below board level. 
In 2009, the maximum and target bonus opportunity will remain 
180% and 90% of base salary respectively for the Chief Executive 
and 150% and 75% of base salary respectively for the other 
Executive Directors.

Deferred and Matching Share Scheme (DMSS) 
An award under the DMSS is normally made to Executive 
Directors and other senior executives in April of each year. 
However, in 2008 the award was delayed due to the Executive 
Directors and other senior executives being subject to prolonged 
dealing restrictions as a result of the Company being in a 
prohibited period under the Company's Model Code. 20% of the 
AIS paid in April 2008 was, however, deferred automatically at  
that time and subsequently invested in Centrica shares (deferred 
shares) once the Company had ceased to be in a prohibited 
period. Participants were also given the opportunity to invest an 
additional amount in Centrica shares (investment shares) funded 
from the actual bonus paid which, when added to the value of the 
deferred shares, would bring the total amount invested up to 50% 
of the individual's maximum bonus entitlement in respect of 2007. 
In order to restore participants to the position they would have 
been in had the Company been able to operate the scheme under 
the normal timetable, the Committee determined that the three-
year period during which time the deferred and investment shares 
cannot be withdrawn would be deemed to have commenced in 
April 2008. Deferred and investment shares were matched with 
conditional shares (matching shares), which will only be released 
upon the achievement of a performance target (see table on page 
47). The performance target, is based on performance over three 
financial years and is unaffected by the delayed operation of the 
DMSS.  
For the purposes of matching, the investment shares are  
grossed up for income tax and National Insurance contributions. 
To provide a closer alignment with the interests of Centrica's 
shareholders, the number of matching shares that are released 
following the satisfaction of the performance condition will be 
increased to reflect the dividends that would have been paid 
during the three-year performance period. In the event of a change 
of control the number of matching shares that vest will be subject 
to time-apportionment in line with best practice.  
Following consultation with major shareholders there will be a 
change to the operation of the DMSS for 2009 and thereafter.  
The performance condition for awards of matching shares will 
remain as three-year growth in EP. However, EP growth will be 
measured on a three-year point-to-point basis going forward, 
rather than a three-year cumulative calculation of growth.  
No changes are being proposed to the maximum bonus 
opportunities, the maximum matching opportunity of 2:1, the 
straight-line vesting criteria or the three-year EP growth target of 
25%. The Company believes that this change will encourage 
executives to invest in the scheme and so align their interests with 
Centrica's shareholders and help drive long-term performance. 
Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS) 
Under the LTIS conditional allocations of shares up to a maximum 
of 200% of base salary may be made to Executive Directors and 
other senior executives.  
In 2008, LTIS allocations equal to 200% of base salary were 
awarded to Executive Directors and, at lower rates, to other senior 
executives. Before approving the maximum permitted allocation 
for the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee carefully 
considered the total shareholder return (TSR) and diluted adjusted 
earnings per share (EPS) performance conditions attaching to the 
award to ensure they were sufficiently stretching. Having reviewed 
the challenging growth and cost reduction targets inherent in the 
strategic plan, the Committee concluded that the proposed EPS 
growth target (ie to exceed the Retail Prices Index (RPI) by 30% or 
more over the performance period for full vesting) was sufficiently 
stretching. The maximum number of shares that could be 
transferred to each Executive Director upon satisfaction of the 
performance conditions in full appears on page 53. The release  
of allocations will be subject to the performance conditions as set 
out in the table on page 47.  
To create a closer alignment with the interests of Centrica's 
shareholders, the number of shares that are released following  
the satisfaction of the performance conditions will be increased to 
reflect the dividends that would have been paid during the three-
year performance period. In the event of a change of control the 
number of shares that vest will be subject to time-apportionment 
in line with best practice. 
Prior to 2006, allocations of shares were made annually to 
Executive Directors and other senior executives under the old 
LTIS, in accordance with the remuneration policy adopted in 2001. 
Such allocations were subject to a performance condition as set 
out in the table on page 47. 
Prior to the release of share allocations under both the old and 
new LTIS arrangements, the Committee reviews whether the 
extent to which the performance conditions have been achieved  
is a genuine reflection of the Company's financial performance.  
In assessing the extent of satisfaction of the performance 
conditions, the Committee uses data provided by Alithos Limited 
(an independent third party) in respect of comparative TSR and 
audited figures in respect of EPS.

Special Long Term Incentive Scheme (SLTIS) 
During 2008, under the SLTIS a one-off allocation was made to 
Mark Hanafin to replace awards from his previous employer, in 
accordance with the terms of his engagement. The SLTIS rules 
were based on the existing LTIS rules and enable an allocation to 
be made that will vest in two equal tranches on 28 February 2009 
and 2010, respectively. In accordance with the rules of the SLTIS 
there are no performance conditions attaching to the shares other 
than continued employment with the Company. In the event of a 
change of control the number of shares that vest will not be 
subject to time-apportionment. 
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) 
No grants of options under the ESOS were made during 2008. 
Details of options granted prior to 2008 and still held by Executive 
Directors are shown on page 54. 
If, and to the extent that, performance conditions are satisfied, 
options normally become exercisable three years after the date of 
grant and remain so until the tenth anniversary of grant. 
The EPS performance conditions in respect of options granted 
from 2001 to March 2004 under the ESOS (as set out in the table 
on page 47) could be measured annually for a further two years 
from the third anniversary of the date of grant of the options, with 
the performance conditions increasing proportionately. Having 
reviewed market practice, the Committee removed the provision 
for re-testing of performance measures in respect of all option 
grants from September 2004.  
Special Executive Share Option Scheme (SESOS) 
In 2008, a grant of unapproved options was made under the 
SESOS to Mark Hanafin to replace awards from his previous 
employer, in accordance with the terms of his engagement. The 
SESOS rules were based on the existing ESOS rules. However,  
in accordance with the rules of the SESOS the grant is not subject 
to any performance conditions and is immediately exercisable  
and will remain so until the tenth anniversary of grant. 
Performance conditions under IFRS 
Following the adoption of IFRS in 2005, the Committee agreed, 
having taken advice from Kepler and having consulted with the 
ABI and RREV, to continue with the financial target of EP  
in respect of the AIS and DMSS; and diluted adjusted EPS in 
respect of the ESOS and the new LTIS, both subject to certain 
adjustments to the figures calculated in accordance with IFRS.  
It was agreed that for the purposes of determining performance in 
respect of those schemes, the relevant figures produced under 
IFRS should be adjusted for exceptional items and certain  
re-measurements arising on the application of IAS 32 and IAS 39. 
Rights Issue 
In December 2008 the performance conditions under the LTIS, 
ESOS and the DMSS were reviewed by the Committee and 
appropriate adjustments were made to reflect the dilutive effect  
of the Rights Issue. Previously reported EPS was restated in 
accordance with IAS 33 and dividends per share for the six 
months ended 30 June 2008, and the preceding five years  
were also restated to take account of the bonus element of  
the Rights Issue. TSR was similarly adjusted by a rate of 0.8902, 
being the formally agreed Rights Issue adjustment formula 
determined by dividing the theoretical ex-rights price (238.36p)  
by the closing share price on the last date the shares traded  
cum-rights (267.75p).

Funding of share schemes  
It is the Company's current intention to satisfy the requirements of 
its share schemes, in a method best suited to the interests of the 
Company, either by acquiring shares in the market or, subject to 
institutional guidelines, issuing new shares or using shares held in 
treasury. To satisfy the release of shares under the LTIS and in 
order to meet the requirements of the ESOS in 2008, newly 
issued shares were used. Shares were bought in the market and 
are held in Trust to satisfy allocations made under the SLTIS and 
SESOS during 2008. 
Pension 
The pension arrangements of the Executive Directors are fully 
disclosed on page 55. 
Other employment benefits 
In common with other senior management, Executive Directors 
are entitled to a range of benefits, including a company car, life 
assurance, private medical insurance and a financial counselling 
scheme. During the year, Mark Hanafin, Sam Laidlaw and Jake 
Ulrich were also provided with a driver for limited personal 
mileage. Such benefits are subject to financial limits as set  
out in appropriate policies. They are also eligible to participate  
in the Company's HMRC-approved Sharesave Scheme and 
Share Incentive Plan, which are open to all eligible employees  
on the same basis, providing a long-term savings and  
investment opportunity. 
Service contracts 
It is the Company's policy that the notice period in Executive 
Directors' service contracts does not exceed one year. The 
Executive Directors' service contracts have no fixed term but 
provide that either the Director or the Company may terminate  
the employment by giving one year's written notice and that the 
Company may pay compensation in lieu of notice.  
In the case of new external appointments to the Board, the 
Committee retains a level of flexibility, as permitted by the Code,  
in order to attract and retain suitable candidates. It therefore 
reserves the right to offer contracts which contain an initial notice 
period in excess of one year, provided that at the end of the first 
such period the notice reduces to one year. The Committee 
exercised this discretion in respect of the appointment of Sam 
Laidlaw on 1 July 2006, Nick Luff on 1 March 2007 and Mark 
Hanafin on 14 July 2008. Each has a service contract that 
contains a notice period of two years, which reduces to one year 
on the second anniversary of their respective date of appointment. 
The notice period contained in Sam Laidlaw's contract has now 
reduced to one year. 
The dates of the Executive Directors' service contracts are set out 
in the table on page 50. 
External appointments of Executive Directors 
The Board believes that experience of other companies' practices 
and challenges is valuable both for the personal development of 
its Executive Directors and for the Company.  
It is therefore the Company's policy to allow each Executive 
Director to accept one non-executive directorship of another 
company, although the Board retains the discretion to vary this 
policy. Fees received in respect of external appointments are 
retained by the individual Director. 
In 2008, Phil Bentley received  67,250 as a non-executive 
director of Kingfisher plc, Sam Laidlaw received  76,667 as  
a non-executive director of HSBC Holdings plc and Nick Luff 
received  47,000 as a non-executive director of QinetiQ  
Group plc. 
Non-Executive Directors 
Non-Executive Directors including the Chairman do not have 
service contracts. Their appointment is subject to the Articles of 
Association and the dates they joined the Board are shown in the 
table on page 50. Roger Carr's letter of appointment contains a 
six-month notice period. The Chairman's fees are approved by 
the Remuneration Committee. The fees of the Non-Executive 
Directors are approved by the Executive Committee, whose 
current members are: the Executive Directors (Sam Laidlaw,  
Phil Bentley, Mark Hanafin and Nick Luff) and five other senior 
executives (Grant Dawson, Deryk King, Catherine May, Anne 
Minto and Chris Weston) all of whose biographies are included  
on pages 36 and 37. 
Centrica's policy on Non-Executive Directors' fees takes into 
account the need to attract individuals of the right calibre and 
experience, their responsibilities and time commitment, as 
envisaged in the Code, and the level of fees paid by other 
companies.  
The annual fees currently payable to the Non-Executive  
Directors are:  
Chairman  450,000
Other Non-Executive Directors  60,000
Additional fees: 
Chairman of Audit Committee  18,000
Chairman of Remuneration Committee  12,000
Chairman of Corporate Responsibility Committee  12,000
Senior Independent Director  20,000
 
The fees are normally reviewed every two years and were last 
reviewed in July 2007. The Non-Executive Directors, including  
the Chairman, do not participate in any of the Company's share 
schemes, incentive plans or pension schemes. 
The Remuneration Report from page 44 to page 49 up to this 
statement has not been audited. From this point until the end of 
the report on page 55, the disclosures, with the exception of the 
graph on page 53, have been audited by the Company's auditors, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

(i) Of the AIS bonus agreed by the Committee in respect of Sam Laidlaw and other Executive Directors, 60% and 70% respectively is paid in cash and  
is included above. 40% of the agreed bonus for Sam Laidlaw ( 419,436) and 30% of the agreed bonus for each Executive Director (range between  86,045 and 
 195,876) is deferred automatically and invested as deferred shares in the Deferred and Matching Share Scheme (DMSS) - see pages 51 and 52. Mark Hanafin was 
appointed to the Board on 14 July 2008 and received AIS pro-rated for the period from his date of appointment, subject to 30% deferral and investment as deferred 
shares, as outlined above. Jake Ulrich retired from the Company on 31 July 2008 and received AIS pro-rated for the period to his date of retirement subject to 20% 
deferral in accordance with the rules of the AIS at that time (AIS figure shown is for the period from 1 January to 12 May 2008, being his date of resignation from the 
Board). Jake Ulrich was not entitled to participate in the DMSS during 2008. 
(ii) Sam Laidlaw is contractually entitled to a salary supplement of 40% of base pay in lieu of any pension provision. This amounted to  362,560 in 2008 (2007:  349,180) of 
which  232,500 (2007:  168,750) was paid directly by the Company into his personal pension plan and is disclosed in the notes on page 55. The balance of  130,060 
(2007:  180,430) is included above under the heading  Additional payments'. Mark Hanafin and Nick Luff are contractually entitled to a salary supplement of 40% and 
30% of base pay respectively in lieu of any pension provision. In addition, cash payments to Mark Hanafin in lieu of bonus payable by his previous employer (for the 
period 1 January to 14 July 2008) and Nick Luff in lieu of the provision of a company car are also included above under the heading 'Additional payments'. 
(iii) Executive and past Directors received a taxable interest payment in October 2008 at the rate of 6.25% in respect of the notional interest accrued on the 20% of the 
annual bonus, paid in April 2008 under the AIS, which was deferred automatically at that time in accordance with the rules of the DMSS and held until the DMSS could 
be operated. The purchase of deferred and investment shares and the conditional award of matching shares were made on 13 October 2008.  
(iv) Benefits include all taxable benefits arising from employment by the Company, including the provision of a car (Mark Hanafin, Sam Laidlaw and Jake Ulrich were also 
provided with a driver for limited personal mileage), financial counselling, medical insurance and life assurance premiums. 
(v) The following are excluded from the table above: 
(a) pensions - see page 55; 
(b) share options - see page 54. No Executive Director exercised share options during the year. The aggregate of the amount of gains made by Executive Directors  
on the exercise of share options for 2007 was  615,839; and 
(c) Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS) - see pages 51 and 53. The aggregate value of shares vested to Executive Directors under the LTIS was  587,332 
(2007:  1,000,974). 
(vi) The 2008 total emoluments figure in respect of Mark Hanafin is for the period from 14 July 2008 (being the date of his appointment to the Board) to 31 December 2008. 
(vii) The 2007 total emoluments figure in respect of Nick Luff is for the ten-month period from 1 March 2007 (being the date of his appointment to the Board) to  
31 December 2007. It includes an additional payment of  145,000 (being a salary supplement of 30% of base pay in lieu of any pension provision). 
(viii) The 2008 total emoluments figure in respect of Jake Ulrich is for the period from 1 January 2008 to 12 May 2008 (being the date of his resignation from the Board).  
He was also paid  77,164 under the rules of the AIS in respect of the period 13 May to 31 July 2008, the date he left the Company.

(i) Shareholdings, DMSS matching shares, LTIS and SLTIS allocations shown as at 31 December 2008, incorporate the impact of the Rights Issue, effective from  
15 December 2008. For every eight existing Centrica plc shares held on 14 November 2008, shareholders received the right to buy three new Centrica plc shares at 160 
pence per share. Conditional share awards, including the DMSS matching shares and LTIS allocations, were subject to an adjustment to reflect the dilutive effect of the 
Rights Issue on these awards and were multiplied by a factor of 1.1233.  
(ii) DMSS matching shares and LTIS allocations for Jake Ulrich have been time-apportioned to his date of leaving the Company on 31 July 2008, and adjusted to 
incorporate the impact of the Rights Issue, as outlined in note (i). 
(iii) Shareholdings, DMSS matching shares and LTIS allocations are shown as at 1 January 2008 or in the case of Mark Hanafin, at 14 July 2008, his date of appointment. 
(iv) As at 25 February 2009, the shareholdings of Phil Bentley, Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff had each increased by 138 shares acquired through the Share Incentive Plan. 
(v) Executive and past Directors' shareholdings shown above include those held in the Share Incentive Plan and the deferred and investment shares held in the DMSS. 
Matching shares held in the DMSS and shares held in the LTIS and SLTIS are provided separately in the table above and in more detail in their respective tables on pages 
52 and 53. 
(vi) LTIS allocations for Mark Hanafin include an allocation of 372,382 shares made for the year under the LTIS and subject to the performance conditions set out in the table 
on page 47. An additional 188,260 shares were awarded to Mark Hanafin under SLTIS as part of the terms of his engagement; vesting of these shares will occur in two 
equal tranches, on 28 February 2009 and 2010 respectively, provided that he remains in continued employment with the Company. 
From 1 January 2008 to 25 February 2009, none of the Directors had any interests in the securities of the Company's subsidiary or 
associated undertakings. During the period from 1 January 2009 to 25 February 2009 there were no changes to the Directors' interests 
in shares apart from the acquisitions of shares under the Share Incentive Plan as outlined in note (iv) above. 
Executive Directors' minimum shareholding policy 
As stated on page 44, the Executive Directors are required to hold shares with a value based on a multiple of their base salary. Under 
that policy the Executive Directors have a period of five years in which to achieve their minimum shareholding requirement. The table 
below sets out, in respect of each Executive Director, their individual requirement and achievement as at 31 December 2008 against 
that requirement.

(i) Executive and past Directors' DMSS allocations are shown as at 31 December 2008 and incorporate the impact of the Rights Issue, effective from 15 December 2008. 
For every eight existing DMSS deferred and investment shares held on 14 November 2008, Executive Directors received the Right (the Rights) to three new Centrica plc 
shares at 160 pence per share. The Rights attaching to deferred shares were automatically tail-swallowed (ie such number of Rights were sold as was necessary to raise 
sufficient funds to take up the balance of unsold Rights), in accordance with the rules of the scheme, and the Rights attaching to investment shares were treated in 
accordance with the instructions of the Executive or past Director, who had the same choices as ordinary shareholders. Conditional share awards, including the DMSS 
matching shares, were subject to an adjustment to reflect the dilutive effect of the Rights Issue and were multiplied by a factor of 1.1233 and their respective market 
prices at allocation were multiplied by a factor of 0.8902. 
(ii) In 2007 and 2008, 20% of gross bonus paid (before the deduction of income tax and National Insurance contributions) was automatically deferred and invested in 
Centrica shares (deferred shares). Participants have the opportunity to make a further investment (investment shares), funded from net annual bonus, so that the 
maximum total investment (on a gross basis) is 50% of the individual's maximum bonus entitlement for the preceding year. 
(iii) At allocation the calculation of the conditional matching shares is made on a gross basis. Investment shares are grossed up (to reflect the impact of income tax and 
National Insurance contributions) for the calculation of the matching shares so that the deferred and investment shares are matched on the same basis. The number of 
matching shares that vest will be determined on a straight-line basis from a zero match for no growth in economic profit to a two-times match for growth of 25% or 
above over a three-year period. The number of matching shares that will be released following the satisfaction of the performance condition will be increased to reflect the 
dividends that would have been paid during the three-year performance period. Dividends are paid on the deferred and investment shares to the participants on the 
normal dividend payment date. 
(iv) During 2008, operation of the DMSS was delayed due to the Executive Directors and other senior executives being subject to dealing restrictions as a result of the 
Company being in a prolonged prohibited period under the Company's Model Code. 20% of the annual bonus payable in April 2008 under the AIS was, however, 
deferred automatically at that time and held until the DMSS could be operated. The purchase of deferred and investment shares and the conditional award of matching 
shares were made on 13 October 2008. 
(v) DMSS matching shares awarded to Jake Ulrich on 4 April 2007 have been time-apportioned to his date of leaving the Company on 31 July 2008, and adjusted  
to incorporate the impact of the Rights Issue, as outlined in note (i).

(i) Executive and past Directors' vested and unvested LTIS and SLTIS allocations are shown, for comparative purposes, as at 31 December 2008 and incorporate the 
impact of the Rights Issue, effective from 15 December 2008. Allocations were subject to an adjustment to reflect the dilutive effect of the Rights Issue and were 
multiplied by a factor of 1.1233 and the respective market price at allocation and vesting date, where applicable, were multiplied by a factor of 0.8902. 
(ii) At the end of the performance period to 31 March 2008, the Company ranked 45th in the relevant comparator group. Consequently, 57.5% of the original allocations 
were released to participants on 3 April 2008. The released shares were subject to income tax at the individual's marginal rate and National Insurance contributions (NICs) 
at the rate of 1%, based on the unadjusted market value of the shares at the date of vesting. The income tax and NICs liability was satisfied by the sale of sufficient 
shares and, accordingly, the Executive Directors only received the net number of shares following disposal, which, to the extent retained and subject to the impact of the 
Rights Issue effective on 15 December 2008, is reflected in the shareholdings as at 31 December 2008 on page 51. 
(iii) At the end of the performance period the Company's TSR performance will be assessed against that of the relevant LTIS comparator group. If, and to the extent that the 
performance conditions are met, the relevant number of shares will be released to the Directors at the Trustee's discretion as soon as practicable thereafter. 
(iv) The percentage of the allocation eventually to vest is dependent on the satisfaction of performance criteria over a three-year performance period: half of the shares (EPS 
shares) will be subject to a performance condition based on the Group's adjusted EPS growth relative to the growth in RPI. EPS growth will be calculated by comparing 
the Group's adjusted EPS figure for the financial period preceding the date of allocation with that for the financial period three years later; and half of the shares will be 
determined by the Company's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance relative to the other companies comprising the LTIS comparator group - the FTSE 100 at the 
start of the performance period (the TSR shares). At the end of the performance period, the TSR performance condition will be measured, the same calculation made for 
all the other 99 companies in the LTIS comparator group and a ranking list will be compiled. 
(v) The first awards under the new LTIS (approval was sought and given by shareholders at the AGM held on 19 May 2006) were made to participants other than the 
Executive Directors on 3 April 2006 (on the date that allocations would normally be made under the previous LTIS and within the 42-day period following the release  
of the Company's annual results). The awards to the Executive Directors then in office could only be made after shareholder approval, but in order to align their awards 
with those of other participants, their first awards were deemed to have been made on 3 April 2006 for all purposes of the new LTIS, including the calculation of the 
number of shares, the adjusted EPS and relative TSR performance tests and the three-year vesting period.  
(vi) Shares were awarded to Mark Hanafin under the terms of the SLTIS on 26 September 2008. In accordance with the rules of the SLTIS there are no performance 
conditions attaching to the shares other than continued employment with the Company. In the event of a change of control the number of shares that vest  
will not be subject to time-apportionment. 
(vii) Allocations made to Jake Ulrich on 3 April 2006 (278,849) and 4 April 2007 (295,851), which remained outstanding on 12 May 2008, being the date of his resignation 
from the Board, have been time-apportioned to his date of leaving the Company on 31 July 2008 and adjusted to incorporate the impact of the Rights Issue, as outlined 
in note (i). 
The following graph, provided by Alithos Limited (an independent third party), shows the TSR performance of the Company and that of

3 April 2006. Details of the operation of the scheme are provided on pages 47 and 48. 
(ii) Special Executive Share Option Scheme (SESOS) 
 Options were granted to Mark Hanafin under the terms of the SESOS on 26 September 2008. In accordance with the rules of the SESOS the grant is not subject  
to any performance conditions and is immediately exercisable and will normally remain so until the tenth anniversary of grant. 
(iii) Sharesave Scheme  
The Company operates an HMRC-approved all-employee savings-related share option scheme in the UK. The scheme is designed to provide a long-term savings and 
investment opportunity for employees. 
(iv) Executive and past Directors' ESOS, SESOS and Sharesave grants and their respective option prices are shown as at 1 January 2008 or in the case of Mark Hanafin, at 
14 July 2008, his date of appointment. 
(v) Executive and past Directors' ESOS, SESOS and Sharesave grants and their respective option prices are shown as at 31 December 2008, and incorporate the impact  
of the Rights Issue, effective from 15 December 2008. Conditional awards, including ESOS, SESOS and Sharesave grants were subject to an adjustment to reflect the 
dilutive effect of the Rights Issue and the number of shares under option was multiplied by a factor of 1.1233 and the respective option price was multiplied by a factor  
of 0.8902. 
(vi) The Committee exercised its discretion, in accordance with the rules of the ESOS, to permit Jake Ulrich to exercise his options up to six months from the third 
anniversary of the last date on which an option was granted ie at any time before 3 October 2009. All of his options are exercisable except those granted in 2006  
which have not yet met the relevant performance conditions. Under the rules of the Sharesave his outstanding options were exercisable until 31 January 2009. 
The closing price of a Centrica ordinary share on the last trading day of 2008 (31 December) was 266 pence. The range during the  
year was 207.50 pence (low) and 316 pence (high), (355 pence prior to adjustment for the bonus element of the Rights Issue).

Directors' pensions 
Of the five Executive Directors who served during 2008, Phil Bentley and Jake Ulrich are members of the Centrica Pension Plan (CPP) 
which was formerly known as the Centrica Management Pension Scheme (CMPS). Mark Hanafin, Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff, who all 
joined the Company in recent years, are not members of any of Centrica's pension schemes.  
Centrica Pension Plan (CPP) 
The CPP is a funded, HMRC-registered, final salary, occupational pension scheme. Its rules provide for the following main features: 
 normal retirement at age 62; 
 right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service after age 60 at own request with employer consent, or on leaving 
service at Company's request after age 55;  
 life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary for death in service; 
 spouse's pension on death in service payable at the rate of 50% of the member's prospective pension and, on death after retirement, 
half of the accrued pension. Children's pensions are also payable; 
 members' contributions payable at the rate of 6% of pensionable earnings. Contributions made by the Executive Directors who are 
also members of the Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme (CUPS) are payable at the rate of 6% of their total pensionable earnings 
above the scheme earnings cap;  
 pension payable in the event of retirement due to ill health; 
 pensions in payment and in deferment guaranteed to increase in line with the increase in the RPI (a maximum of 6% applies to 
pension accrued after 6 April 2004); and 
 no discretionary practices are taken into account in calculating transfer values. 
All registered scheme benefits are subject to HMRC guidelines. As a result of the changes introduced by Centrica following the 2004 
Finance Act, benefits at 6 April 2006 from the registered scheme, the CPP, could not exceed the Lifetime Allowance ( 1.5 million for  
the 2006/07 tax year) after taking account of retained benefits from all other sources notified to Centrica at this time. The CUPS 
provides any additional benefits in excess of the maximum amount that could be provided through the CPP on the members' 
uncapped pensionable earnings. The benefits that arise under CUPS are treated as being subject to the same rules as apply in respect 
of the registered portion of members' benefits. No individual will receive benefits from Centrica which, when added to their retained 
benefits elsewhere at 6 April 2006, exceed two-thirds of their final pensionable earnings. CUPS is unfunded but the benefits are 
secured by a charge over certain Centrica assets. An appropriate provision in respect of the accrued value of these benefits has been 
made in the Company's balance sheet.

(i) Accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age 62, based on eligible service to, and pensionable salary at, 31 December 2008. The pension 
accrual rates for 2008 for Phil Bentley and Jake Ulrich were 2.65% and 3.71% respectively. 
(ii) The increase in accrued pension has been adjusted to exclude inflation by revaluing the accrued pension as at 31 December 2007 by the rate of inflation (5.0%) and 
deducting this from the accrued pension as at 31 December 2008. The rate of inflation used was 5.0%, the annual rate to 30 September 2008, the date used for pension 
increases under the scheme. 
(iii) Jake Ulrich retired on 31 July 2008. Under the rules of the CPP and CUPS Jake Ulrich (aged 55 years 5 months on leaving) was entitled to an actuarially reduced pension 
on the standard terms for a normal deferred leaver taking payment of their pension before normal retirement age.  
(iv) The reduction in the transfer values less contributions at 31 December 2008 is due to the change in market conditions which determine the calculation of transfer values. 
A change in the transfer value calculation basis was also introduced in September 2008. Had the transfer value been calculated on the accrued pension at 31 December 
2008 but using the calculation basis in force at 31 December 2007, the transfer value of the accrued pension would have amounted to  1,032,100 for Phil Bentley and 
 4,437,900 for Jake Ulrich. The difference in the transfer value less contributions would have amounted to ( 399,620) for Phil Bentley and  1,217,155 for Jake Ulrich. 
 
Pay in lieu of pension provision 
Under the terms of their contracts of employment, Mark Hanafin, Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff are entitled to a salary supplement in lieu 
of pension provision. Mark Hanafin and Sam Laidlaw are each entitled to 40% of base salary, while Nick Luff is entitled to 30% of base 
salary. With the exception of  232,500 paid directly by the Company into Sam Laidlaw's personal pension plan, these amounts are 
disclosed in the Directors' emoluments table on page 50. 
This report on remuneration has been approved by the Board of Directors and signed on its behalf by:
