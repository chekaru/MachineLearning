Remuneration Report
 
In 2009, the Remuneration Committee (the 
Committee) reviewed the remuneration 
arrangements for Executive Directors. The 
proposed changes for 2010 are summarised in 
the letter to shareholders shown on this page.  
 
Letter to shareholders 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Committee's 
Report on Remuneration for 2009 for which we will be seeking 
approval from shareholders at our Annual General Meeting in  
May 2010. 
Remuneration principles 
In considering remuneration for our senior executives the 
Remuneration Committee has developed the following framework 
of principles. This has also formed the basis for the review of 
remuneration which began in 2009 and will continue in 2010. 
  Incentives will reinforce key business objectives, promote an 
ownership culture, and align executive and shareholder interests. 
  Senior executive remuneration levels will be benchmarked and 
structured to ensure Centrica's total remuneration levels (i.e. 
including all fixed and variable pay components) are competitive.  
  The Committee will take into account market practice, best 
practice and best fit for Centrica when determining the 
appropriate structure of pay. 
  A significant proportion of senior executive remuneration will be 
delivered through long-term share-based pay. 
  Incentive structures will be simple, transparent and robust, and 
structured to avoid encouraging excessive risk-taking. 
  Annual and long-term incentives will be based on Group, 
Business Unit and individual performance. Measures will include 
leading indicators of sustainable performance with health, safety 
and environmental objectives. 
  Incentive targets may be adjusted at the discretion of the 
Committee to take account of  non-performance items' outside 
management control that would otherwise distort the 
measurement of management performance. 
Background and principles for proposed changes 
The Committee commenced a review of senior executive 
remuneration arrangements during 2009, to ensure that our 
remuneration principles continue to support the business. The 
review will continue in 2010 and any significant changes will be 
discussed with shareholders. 
The main changes proposed to date are described below: 
Rebalancing short-term incentives 
Recognising the continued importance of meeting our Health, 
Safety and Environmental (HS&E) objectives, in 2010 each 
Executive Director will have an element of their Annual Incentive 
Scheme determined by the achievement of HS&E objectives.  
As a result of the introduction of HS&E objectives, the bonus 
opportunity for on target performance will remain unchanged at 
90% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 75% for the other 
Executive Directors. 
Performance measurement 
The measurement of Total Shareholder Return (TSR) under the 
Long Term Incentive Scheme will be amended going forward so 
that the Group's TSR will be measured as a percentage of out-
performance of the FTSE 100 index. To provide greater simplicity 
and transparency in the measurement process, companies which 
have been de-listed from the London Stock Exchange will be 
removed from the comparator group in future. 
Giving greater flexibility for tax planning 
In order to provide employees with greater flexibility, from 2010 
awards made under the Long Term Incentive Scheme, and 
matching awards made under the Deferred and Matching Share 
Scheme, will be structured as nil-cost options. This change in 
structure will not affect any other conditions or the total value of 
awards made.   
Managing the balance of amount and risk 
The economic crisis emphasised the need to ensure that the 
potential amount of remuneration and the stretch of performance 
targets do not encourage excessive risk-taking. We are satisfied 
that our proposed structure does not do this. 
Aligning pay with the relevant market benchmark 
We will continue to benchmark the remuneration of our senior 
executives against a UK cross-industry comparator group. We  
will also take into account international comparators within  
our industry.  
Board membership 
Chris Weston was promoted to the Board as an Executive Director 
midway through 2009 and this Report describes his remuneration 
arrangements in detail for the first time. Paul Walsh was a member 
of the Committee until he retired from the Board at the Annual 
General Meeting on 11 May 2009. We thank Paul for his valuable 
contribution to the Committee's work during recent years.  
The Committee believes that the proposed changes represent a 
step forward in supporting the future direction of the business, are 
aligned to our values and are in the best interests of shareholders.

Introduction to the Report 
This Report details the Company's executive remuneration policy 
and includes information on the remuneration of the Directors for 
the financial year ended 31 December 2009. 
The Report will be presented to the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) for approval. It explains how the Company has 
applied the principles of the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance (the Code) that relate to Directors' remuneration 
during the year. No Director is involved in the determination of,  
or votes on, any matter relating to his or her own remuneration. 
The Remuneration Committee 
The role of the Committee 
The Committee is a committee of the Board and its terms of 
reference are available from the General Counsel & Company 
Secretary and are also published on the Company's website 
www.centrica.com. 
The principal role of the Committee is to determine and make 
recommendations to the Board on the Company's framework  
and broad policy for the remuneration of the Chairman of the 
Board, the Company's Executive Directors and other senior 
executives, and the associated costs. 
Members of the Committee during 2009 
Throughout 2009 Helen Alexander was Chairman of the 
Committee and Roger Carr, Mary Francis, Andrew Mackenzie and 
Paul Rayner were members of the Committee. Paul Walsh was a 
member of the Committee until he retired from the Board at the 
AGM on 11 May 2009. The Board has determined that each of  
the Non-Executive Directors who are members of the Committee 
is independent. 
Advice provided to the Committee 
During 2009, the Committee had access to the advice and  
views of: 
  the Group Director, Human Resources; 
  the Group Director, Reward; 
  the Chief Executive;  
  the Head of Audit and Risk; 
  the General Counsel & Company Secretary; 
  Kepler Associates (Kepler) who acted as independent external 
adviser to the Committee; and  
  Towers Watson who were consulted but not formally appointed  
as advisers to the Committee. 
Neither Kepler nor Towers Watson provided any other advice to 
the Company.  
The Committee's activities during 2009 
The Committee under its terms of reference usually meets at least 
four times a year. In 2009 the Committee met six times and some 
of the key items which were considered are described in the table 
opposite.

Executive Directors' remuneration policy  
and framework 
How reward is aligned to our strategy 
The Committee believes alignment between Centrica's business 
strategy and the remuneration of its Executive Directors and senior 
executives to be essential.  
  The fixed elements of our remuneration packages are 
competitive, but not excessive, against the markets in which we 
compete for talent. This avoids building unnecessary current and 
future costs into the business.  
  A significant proportion of the total remuneration opportunity 
depends upon delivering business performance. Total 
remuneration will increase with strong performance and go 
down if the business performs poorly. 
  Short-term incentives are focused on the delivery of strategically 
aligned performance measures, determined on a role-by-role 
basis. These include demanding financial and business-related 
objectives.  
  Longer-term incentives reward the creation of shareholder value 
over a three-year period. Performance is measured using a 
combination of earnings per share (EPS) growth, relative Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) performance and Group Economic 
Profit (EP). 
Remuneration policy  
The remuneration policy aims to deliver a remuneration package:  
  that will attract and retain Executive Directors and other senior 
executives in a challenging business environment that is 
competitive in both commercial and human resource terms; 
  that delivers an appropriate balance between fixed and variable 
compensation for each executive; 
  in which a significant proportion depends on the attainment of 
demanding performance objectives, both short and long term;  
  that provides a strong alignment with the achievement of 
strategic objectives and the delivery of value to shareholders; and 
  that seeks to avoid creating excessive risks in the achievement 
of performance targets. 
Remuneration framework 
The remuneration framework reflects current best practice, 
including the provisions on the design of performance related 
remuneration as set out in Schedule A to the Code, while meeting 
the Group's particular business needs: 
  the Committee reviews the packages and varies individual 
elements when appropriate from year to year; 
  in agreeing the level of base salaries and the performance-
related elements of the remuneration package, the Committee 
considers the potential maximum remuneration that executives 
could receive; 
  the AIS is designed to incentivise and reward the achievement  
of demanding financial and business-related objectives; and 
  long-term share-based incentives are designed to align the 
interests of Executive Directors and other senior executives  
with the longer-term interests of Centrica's shareholders  
by rewarding them for delivering sustained, increased 
shareholder value. 
Remuneration mix 
In 2009, the total remuneration package of the Executive Directors 
comprised elements in the following proportions: 
Relative proportions of the components of each Executive 
Director's remuneration (%) in 2009 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Shareholding guidelines 
A minimum shareholding policy requires the retention of a value of 
shares as follows:  
  Chief Executive - 2 times his base salary;  
  other Executive Directors - 1.25 times their base salary; and  
  executives immediately below Board level - 1 times their  
base salary.  
The level of achievement measured against this requirement for 
Executive Directors is set out in the table on page 56. 
Pension and other benefits 
Executive Directors, with the exception of Phil Bentley and Chris 
Weston, are entitled under the terms of their contracts of 
employment to receive a salary supplement in lieu of pension 
provision. The salary supplements are paid in cash, with the 
exception of part of the supplement for Sam Laidlaw which is paid 
directly into his personal pension plan. The cash amounts paid in 
the year are disclosed within the Directors' emoluments table and 
related footnotes on page 53.  
Phil Bentley and Chris Weston participate in the Centrica Pension 
Plan (CPP) (a contributory final salary arrangement) and in the 
Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme (CUPS). Full disclosure of 
the pension arrangements for the Executive Directors is given on 
pages 51, 58 and 59. 
Emoluments of senior executives below Board level 
The total emoluments of the five senior executives immediately 
below Board level during 2009, calculated on the same basis as 
the emoluments of the Executive Directors detailed on page 53, fell 
into the following bands: 
Bands  000  Number of senior executives  
600 - 699 2
500 - 599  1
400 - 499 2
The Committee takes into consideration the remuneration 
arrangements for the wider employee population in making its 
decisions on remuneration for senior executives.

The Committee establishes a base salary for each Executive 
Director and other senior executives. Base salaries are determined 
by individual performance and having regard to market salary 
levels for similar positions in comparable companies. Base salaries 
are reviewed annually.  
Changes in 2009 
There were no base salary increases for Executive Directors in 
2009 other than when a significant change in role took place.  
Phil Bentley received a base salary increase when his role 
increased significantly when he took on responsibility for the UK 
downstream business. Chris Weston received a base salary 
increase when he was promoted to the Board on 1 July 2009. 
Changes in 2010 
It has been decided that base salary increases averaging 5% will 
be awarded to the Executive Directors in 2010, two of whom have 
assumed additional responsibilities. This maintains salaries at 
around median of the market and follows a year of significant 
delivery including the consolidation of British Gas into one 
business, the acquisition of Venture Production plc and the 
completion of the investment in British Energy. 
Annual performance measures in 2009 
The annual performance metrics used in the AIS in 2009 were 
designed to reward the delivery of our key strategic priorities for 
the year. Some examples of performance metrics used in 2009 
include: EP; meeting cost reduction targets; project completion 
and customer satisfaction measured by third party, industry 
recognised surveys.

Deferred and Matching Share Scheme (DMSS) 
Assists with employee retention and incentivises the creation of 
long-term value for shareholders and delivery of sustained high 
performance. 
 
In 2009, the primary financial measure was EP. In addition, each 
Business Unit had a number of business metrics focusing on their 
key strategic priorities for the year: Business Unit Economic Profit, 
cost reduction targets, project completion and customer 
satisfaction levels.  
Performance is also assessed against a corporate responsibility 
scorecard that includes Health, Safety and Environment (HS&E) 
performance indicators. If overall performance against the 
corporate responsibility scorecard was not satisfactory, the overall 
Business Unit metric results for the year would have been reduced. 
A bonus will be forfeited if overall performance is deemed to be 
unsatisfactory.  
Annual incentive opportunities in 2009 
At the beginning of each year, the Committee reviews the AIS  
to ensure that the incentive opportunity remains competitive in  
the marketplace. For 2009, the target and maximum bonus 
opportunity, together with the relative proportions of the 
components that made up the target bonus opportunity,  
were as follows:  
Percentage bonus opportunities at target and maximum 
Performance for 2009 
The annual bonus outcomes of the 2009 AIS were determined  
by performance against each of the metrics used. Annual bonus 
levels ranged from 106% to 185% of target for the Executive 
Directors. Annual bonus awards for Executive Directors were 
between 79% and 165% of base salary. 
Changes for 2010 
In 2010, performance against an HS&E metric will replace part of 
the Business Unit metrics as a core element of the AIS. The bonus 
opportunity for on target performance will remain unchanged at 
90% of base salary for the Chief Executive, and 75% of base 
salary for the other Executive Directors.  
Deferral of annual incentives 
Part of an Executive Director's AIS award is compulsorily deferred 
and invested in DMSS (see below). 40% of any AIS award for the 
Chief Executive and 30% for Executive Directors and executives 
immediately below Board level will be deferred. 
Compulsory deferral 
Part of the bonus earned under AIS for the previous year is 
compulsorily deferred into Centrica shares (deferred shares).  
If these shares are held for three years the deferred shares  
will be matched to the extent that a long-term performance 
condition is met. 
Voluntary deferral 
Executives may make an additional voluntary deferral of AIS into 
Centrica shares (investment shares). The maximum total deferral 
that may be made, including the compulsory deferral, is up to 50% 
of the maximum annual incentive opportunity which may be earned  
for a year.

Performance measures attaching to the DMSS awards 
The performance conditions attaching to DMSS awards made for 2007 to 2009 are shown in the table below. 
Vesting criteria 2009 Performance condition over three-year period 
Level at which shares matched depends on point-to-point  
EP performance targets 
  2 for 1 match for point-to-point EP growth of 25% or more 
  Zero match for no point-to-point EP growth 
  Vesting of matching shares will increase on a straight-line basis 
between these points 
Vesting criteria 2007 and 2008   
Level at which shares matched depends on cumulative  
EP performance targets 
  2 for 1 match for cumulative EP growth of 25% or more 
  Zero match for no cumulative EP growth 
  Vesting of matching shares will increase on a straight-line basis 
between these points 
 
Share matching 
Share matching increases on a straight-line basis from zero 
matching for no EP growth to a maximum of 2 for 1 matching for 
three-year EP growth of 25% or more.  
For the purposes of matching, the investment shares are  
grossed up for income tax and employees' National Insurance 
contributions. To provide a closer alignment with the interests of 
Centrica's shareholders, the number of matching shares that are 
released will be increased to reflect the dividends that would have 
been paid during the three-year performance period on the 
matching shares that vest.  
In the event of a change of control the number of matching  
shares that vest will be subject to time-apportionment in line  
with best practice.  
For awards made from 2010 onwards it is intended that the 
matched shares will be awarded in the form of nil-cost options. 
 
DMSS awards delayed in 2009 
In 2009 the Executive Directors, and a number of senior 
executives, were subject to dealing restrictions under the 
Company's Share Dealing Code. 40% of AIS payable in 2009  
to the Chief Executive, and 30% for Executive Directors and 
executives immediately below Board level, was deferred and 
automatically invested in deferred shares, in accordance with  
the normal timetable. Participants were given the opportunity to 
indicate if they wished to invest in investment shares and the 
investment took place in May 2009, once the Company had 
ceased to be in a prohibited period. 
In order to restore participants to the position they would have 
been in had the Company been able to operate the scheme  
under the normal timetable in 2009, the Committee determined 
that the three-year performance period will be deemed to have 
commenced in April 2009. Deferred and investment shares will  
be matched with shares only to the extent that the performance 
condition is met (see table above). The performance condition is 
based on performance over three financial years and is unaffected 
by the delayed operation of the DMSS. 
Under the LTIS conditional allocations of shares up to a maximum of 200% of base salary may be made to Executive Directors and 
other senior executives. In 2009, LTIS allocations equal to 200% of base salary were awarded to Executive Directors and, at lower 
levels, to other senior executives. The performance measures attaching to the LTIS awards made for 2008 and 2009 are shown in  
the table below. 
Vesting criteria Performance condition over three-year period 
One half on EPS growth against RPI growth 
  If EPS growth does not exceed RPI growth by 9%, zero vesting 
  If EPS growth exceeds RPI growth by 9%, then 25% will vest 
  If EPS growth exceeds RPI growth by between 9% and 30%, 
then vesting will increase on a straight-line basis between 25% 
and 100%  
  Full vesting for EPS growth exceeding RPI growth by 30% 
EPS is the Group's diluted adjusted earnings per share 
One half on TSR measured against a comparator group of the 
FTSE 100 as constituted at the beginning of the performance 
period 
  Full vesting for upper quintile ranking 
  Zero vesting for sub-median ranking 
  Vesting will increase on a straight-line basis between 25% and 
100% for ranking between median and upper quintile

The maximum number of shares that could be transferred to each 
Executive Director upon satisfaction of the performance conditions 
appears on page 54.  
In assessing the extent to which the performance conditions have 
been met, the Committee uses data provided by Alithos Limited 
(an independent third party) for comparative TSR performance and 
audited results for EPS performance. The TSR graphs for the LTIS 
awards that vested in April and September 2009 are shown on 
page 56. 
The Committee also reviews whether the extent to which the 
performance conditions have been achieved is a genuine reflection 
of the Company's underlying financial performance.  
TSR payout   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To the extent that the performance condition is met, the number of 
shares that are released will be increased to reflect the dividends 
that would have been paid on those shares during the three-year 
performance period.  
For LTIS awards made in 2007 the vesting criteria were largely  
as above. The TSR element was unchanged. For the 50% of the 
award for which the performance criteria was EPS growth, the 
performance criteria was as above for 37.5% of the award. For the 
remaining 12.5%, if EPS growth does not exceed RPI growth by 
20%, there is zero vesting. If EPS growth exceeds RPI growth by 
20%, then 25% will vest. If EPS growth exceeds RPI growth by 
between 20% and 40%, then vesting will increase on a straight-line 
basis between 25% and 100%. There is full vesting for EPS growth 
exceeding RPI growth by 40%.  
LTIS awards made in 2006 were subject to the same vesting 
criteria and performance conditions as set out in the table on  
page 50. 
Each year, before making LTIS awards, the Committee considers 
the performance conditions attaching to them, to ensure that they 
are aligned with the challenging growth and cost reduction targets 
inherent in the strategic plan. 
Changes for 2010 
In respect of LTIS awards in 2010 and in subsequent years, it is 
intended that these will be structured as nil-cost options.  
The measurement of TSR will also be amended going forward 
such that the Group's TSR will be measured as a percentage out-
performance of the FTSE 100 Index. Vesting will increase on a 
straight-line basis between 25% and 100% for out-performance of 
between 0.1% and 7% p.a.  To provide greater simplicity and 
transparency in the measurement process, companies which have 
been de-listed from the London Stock Exchange will be removed 
from the comparator group in future. 
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) 
No grants of options under the ESOS were made during 2009. 
Details of options granted prior to 2009 and still held by Executive 
Directors are shown on page 57. 
If, and to the extent that, performance conditions are satisfied, 
options normally become exercisable three years after the date  
of grant and remain so until the tenth anniversary of grant. 
Funding of share schemes  
It is the Company's current intention to satisfy the requirements of 
its share schemes in a method best suited to the interests of the 
Company, either by acquiring shares in the market or, subject to 
institutional guidelines, issuing new shares or using shares held in 
treasury. To satisfy the release of shares under the LTIS and in 
order to meet the requirements of the ESOS in 2009, newly issued 
shares were used. Shares were bought in the market and are held 
in trust to satisfy allocations made under the Special Long Term 
Incentive Scheme (SLTIS) and Special Executive Share Option 
Scheme (SESOS) during 2008. 
Retirement benefits 
Executive Directors, with the exception of Phil Bentley and Chris 
Weston, are entitled under the terms of their contracts of 
employment to receive a salary supplement in lieu of pension 
provision. Mark Hanafin and Sam Laidlaw are each entitled to 40% 
of base salary, while Nick Luff is entitled to 30% of base salary, 
increasing to 40% with effect from April 2010.  
The salary supplements are paid in cash, with the exception of part 
of the supplement for Sam Laidlaw which is paid directly into his 
personal pension plan. The cash amounts paid in the year directly 
to individuals are disclosed within the Directors' emoluments table 
on page 53.  
Phil Bentley and Chris Weston continue to participate in the 
Centrica Pension Plan (CPP) (a contributory final salary 
arrangement), as they were employed in the Group before the  
plan was closed to new employees on 30 June 2003. They also 
participate in the Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme (CUPS). 
Disclosure of the pension arrangements for the Executive Directors 
is given on pages 58 and 59. 
Other employment benefits 
In common with other senior management, Executive Directors  
are entitled to a range of benefits, including a company car, life 
assurance premiums, private medical insurance and a financial 
counselling scheme. During the year, Mark Hanafin and Sam 
Laidlaw were also provided with a driver for limited personal 
mileage. Nick Luff is provided with a cash allowance in lieu of a 
company car. Such benefits are subject to financial limits as set 
out in appropriate policies.  
They are also eligible to participate in the Company's HMRC-
approved Sharesave Scheme and Share Incentive Plan, which  
are open to all eligible employees on the same basis, providing  
a long-term savings and investment opportunity. 
All taxable benefits arising from employment by the Company  
have been included in the  Benefits and other cash' column of

Service contracts 
It is the Company's policy that the notice period in Executive 
Directors' service contracts does not exceed one year. The 
Executive Directors' service contracts have no fixed term but 
provide that either the Director or the Company may terminate  
the employment by giving one year's written notice and that  
the Company may pay compensation in lieu of notice.  
On a change of control, conditional awards under DMSS and LTIS 
will vest to the extent that the performance conditions have been 
met at the vesting date and pro-rated for the time elapsed since 
the start of each performance period, until the vesting date, 
subject to the overriding discretion of the Committee. 
In the case of new external appointments to the Board, the 
Committee retains a level of flexibility, as permitted by the Code, in 
order to attract and retain suitable candidates. It therefore reserves 
the right to offer contracts which contain an initial notice period in 
excess of one year, provided that at the end of the first such 
period the notice period reduces to one year. The Committee 
exercised this discretion in respect of the appointment of Sam 
Laidlaw on 1 July 2006, Nick Luff on 1 March 2007 and Mark 
Hanafin on 14 July 2008. Each has a service contract that contains 
a notice period of two years, which reduces to one year on the 
second anniversary of their respective date of appointment. The 
contractual notice periods for Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff reduced 
to one year in 2008 and 2009 respectively. 
External appointments of Executive Directors 
The Board believes that experience of other companies' practices 
and challenges is valuable both for the personal development of its 
Executive Directors and for the Company.  
It is therefore the Company's policy to allow each Executive 
Director to accept one non-executive directorship of another 
company, although the Board retains the discretion to vary this 
policy. Fees received in respect of external appointments are 
retained by the individual Director. 
In 2009, Phil Bentley received  68,300 as a non-executive director 
of Kingfisher plc, Sam Laidlaw received  85,000 as a non-
executive director of HSBC Holdings plc and Nick Luff received 
 47,000 as a non-executive director of QinetiQ Group plc.  
Non-Executive Directors 
Remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors 
Centrica's policy on Non-Executive Directors' fees takes into 
account the need to attract individuals of the right calibre and 
experience, their responsibilities and time commitment and the 
level of fees paid by other companies.  
Fees  
The annual fees currently payable to the Non-Executive  
Directors are:   
Base fees 
Chairman  450,000
Non-Executive Directors  60,000
Additional fees 
Chairman of Audit Committee  18,000
Chairman of Remuneration Committee  12,000
Chairman of Corporate Responsibility Committee  12,000
Senior Independent Director  20,000
 
The fees are usually reviewed every two years and were reviewed 
in June 2009. In line with our decision to award no base salary 
increases to Executive Directors in 2009 (except where individuals 
have had a significant change to their responsibilities), no increases 
in fees were awarded to Non-Executive Directors. The fee levels 
will next be reviewed in 2010. 
The Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, do not 
participate in any of the Company's share schemes, incentive 
plans or pension schemes. 
Terms of appointment 
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, do not have 
service contracts. Their appointment is subject to the Articles of 
Association and the dates they joined the Board are shown in the 
table on page 53. Roger Carr's letter of appointment contains a 
six-month notice period. The Chairman's fees are approved by the 
Remuneration Committee. The fees of the Non-Executive Directors 
are approved by the Executive Committee, whose current 
members are: the Executive Directors (Sam Laidlaw, Phil Bentley, 
Mark Hanafin, Nick Luff and Chris Weston) and three other senior 
executives (Grant Dawson, Catherine May and Anne Minto) all of 
whose biographies are included on pages 36 and 37. 
Other matters in 2009 
Promotion to the Board 
Chris Weston was appointed to the Board on 1 July 2009. His 
base salary on appointment was  500,000 per annum. His AIS is 
subject to 30% deferral and investment as deferred shares under 
DMSS. His opportunity to participate in LTIS increased on his 
appointment, in line with our policy. He received an LTIS award of 
150% of base salary in April 2009 and a further LTIS award of 50% 
of salary in September 2009. 
Enlargement of roles 
Phil Bentley's role as Managing Director, British Gas, broadened 
significantly in 2009 as the residential energy, services and 
business energy activities were combined into a single customer-
focused retail operation. In recognition of this change he received 
an increase in his base salary. In addition, a commitment was 
made that if he remains with the Group at least until January 2012, 
the accrued value of his pension under CPP will be increased 
progressively over time. 
Mark Hanafin and Nick Luff assumed responsibilities for the 
Company's nuclear investments in 2009. 
Other matters in 2008 
Rights Issue adjustments 
Under the Rights Issue effective 15 December 2008, for every 
eight existing Centrica plc shares held on 14 November 2008, 
shareholders received the right to buy three new Centrica plc 
shares at 160 pence per share. Existing conditional share awards, 
including DMSS matching shares and LTIS allocations, were 
adjusted to reflect the dilutive effect of the Rights Issue and were 
multiplied by a factor of 1.1233. 
The performance conditions under the LTIS, ESOS and the DMSS 
were also reviewed by the Committee and appropriate 
adjustments were made to reflect the dilutive effect of the Rights 
Issue. Previously reported EPS was restated in accordance with 
IAS 33 and dividends per share for the six months ended 30 June 
2008, and the preceding five years, were restated to take account 
of the bonus element of the Rights Issue. TSR was adjusted by a 
rate of 0.8902, being the agreed Rights Issue adjustment formula 
determined by dividing the theoretical ex-rights price (238.36 
pence) by the closing share price on the last date the shares 
traded cum-rights (267.75 pence).

Recruitment to the Board 
Mark Hanafin was appointed to the Board on 14 July 2008. 
A one-off allocation was made to him under the SLTIS to replace 
awards from his previous employer, in accordance with the terms 
of his engagement. The SLTIS rules were based on the existing 
LTIS rules. An allocation of shares was made to vest in two equal 
tranches on 28 February 2009 and 2010. The first tranche vested 
in 2009. In accordance with the rules of the SLTIS, there are no 
performance conditions attaching to the remaining unvested  
shares other than continued employment with the Company. In the 
event of a change of control, the number of shares that vest will 
not be subject to time-apportionment. 
A grant of unapproved options was also made under the SESOS 
to him in 2008 to replace awards from his previous employer, in 
accordance with the terms of his engagement. The SESOS rules 
were based on the existing ESOS rules. However, in accordance 
with the rules of the SESOS, the grant is not subject to any 
performance conditions, is exercisable immediately and will remain 
so until the tenth anniversary of grant.

Notes on information shown in the DMSS tables 
(i) Allocations for 2007 and 2008 were adjusted in 2008 to take account of the dilutive effect of the Rights Issue. 
(ii) At allocation the calculation of the conditional matching shares is made on a gross basis. For the calculation of the matching shares, investment shares are grossed up (to reflect the impact of income 
tax and employees' National Insurance contributions) so that the deferred and investment shares are matched on the same basis. The number of matching shares that will be released following the 
satisfaction of the performance condition will be increased to reflect the dividends that would have been paid during the three-year performance period, as if they had been paid on the normal dividend 
payment dates. Dividends are paid on the deferred and investment shares to the participants on the normal dividend payment date. 
(iii) In 2008 the operation of DMSS was delayed due to the Executive Directors and other senior executives being subject to prolonged dealing restrictions under the Company's Share Dealing Code.  
20% of the AIS paid in April 2008 was deferred automatically. The investment in deferred and investment shares and the conditional award of matching shares were made on 13 October 2008, once 
the Company had ceased to be in a prohibited period.  
(iv) In 2009 40% of the AIS paid to Sam Laidlaw, and 30% for the other Executive Directors, was deferred automatically.  The investment in deferred shares and the conditional award of matching shares 
were made on 3 April 2009. The voluntary element of the DMSS was delayed due to the Executive Directors and other senior executives being subject to dealing restrictions under the Company's 
Share Dealing Code. The purchase of investment shares and the conditional award of matching shares were made on 26 May 2009, once the Company had ceased to be in a prohibited period.

Notes on information shown in the table 
(i) LTIS awards made in April 2006 were subject to EPS and TSR performance conditions. As at 31 December 2008, the Company's EPS growth had exceeded RPI by 25.1% and as a result 82.14% of 
the EPS shares allocated vested. At the end of the performance period to 2 April 2009, the Company ranked 19th against the FTSE 100 comparator group as constituted at the start of the performance 
period and as a result 100% of the TSR shares vested. Consequently, overall 91.07% of the original allocations were released to participants on 7 April 2009.  
(ii) LTIS awards made in September 2006 were subject to EPS and TSR performance conditions. As at 31 December 2008, the Company's EPS growth had exceeded RPI by 25.1% and as a result 
82.14% of the EPS shares allocated vested. At the end of the performance period to 3 September 2009, the Company ranked 34th against the FTSE 100 comparator group as constituted at the start 
of the performance period and as a result 65% of the TSR shares vested. Consequently, overall 73.57% of the original allocations were released to participants on 9 September 2009.  
(iii) Additional shares were released to reflect the value of the dividends that would have been paid over the respective three-year period. The total shares released were subject to income tax at the 
individual's marginal rate and employees' National Insurance contributions (NICs) at the rate of 1%, based on the market value of the shares at the date of vesting. The income tax and NICs liability was 
satisfied by the sale of sufficient shares and, accordingly, the Executive Directors only received the net number of shares following the sale, which, to the extent retained, is reflected in the shareholdings 
as at 31 December 2009 on page 54. 
(iv) 188,260 shares (made in two equal tranches) were awarded to Mark Hanafin under SLTIS as part of the terms of his appointment in 2008. In accordance with the rules of the SLTIS there are no 
performance conditions attaching to the award other than continued employment with the Company. In the event of a change of control the number of shares that vest will not be subject to time-
apportionment. The first tranche of 94,130 shares were released on 2 March 2009 and were subject to the same income tax and NICs treatment as set out in note (iii) above, with the sale of sufficient 
shares to satisfy the liabilities. The remaining 94,130 shares will vest on 28 February 2010. 
(v) At the end of each performance period the Company's EPS and TSR performance will be assessed. If, and to the extent that the performance conditions are met, the relevant number of shares will be 
released to the Executive Directors, at the Trustee's discretion, as soon as practicable thereafter.

Notes on information shown in the table of Directors' interests in share options 
(i) Executive Directors' ESOS, SESOS and Sharesave grants and their respective option prices at the start of the year are shown as at 1 January 2009 or, in the case of Chris Weston, at 1 July 2009, his 
date of appointment to the Board.  
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS)  
  Options were granted to the Executive Directors under the terms of the ESOS on 31 May 2001, 2 April 2002, 24 March 2003,  
18 March 2004, 1 April 2005 and 3 April 2006.  
  No options were granted in 2007, 2008 or 2009. 
  During 2009 the Committee considered whether the performance test had been met in respect of the grants made in 2006. Over  
the three-year performance period EPS growth was 25.1% in excess of RPI and the options granted in 2006 vested in full. The 
performance criteria have now been met in respect of all of the outstanding grants under ESOS, and the Executive Directors  
have a 10 year period from each date of grant during which they can exercise their options.  
Special Executive Share Option Scheme (SESOS) 
  Options were granted to Mark Hanafin under the terms of the SESOS on 26 September 2008. In accordance with the rules of  
the SESOS, the grant is not subject to any performance conditions and is exercisable and will normally remain so until the tenth 
anniversary of the grant date.  
The closing price of a Centrica ordinary share on the last trading day of 2009, which was 31 December 2009, was 281.10 pence.  
The range during the year was 214.75 pence (low) and 285.75 pence (high).

Share Plan arrangements for Venture employees 
Following the acquisition of Venture Production plc (Venture) in 2009, employees previously employed by Venture were awarded shares 
under the Centrica Share Award Scheme 2007 on 1 October 2009. Such awards will vest on 1 August 2010 and in accordance with the 
scheme rules there are no performance conditions other than continued employment within the Group. In addition, a new Centrica 
Deferred Bonus Plan was introduced for the same population of Venture employees under which they are given the opportunity to defer 
up to 100% of their actual bonus paid for the four month period ended on 31 December 2009, and receive an award of conditional 
shares. Such awards would vest after two years at which time they are eligible for matching shares on a 1.5 for 1 basis, subject to 
continued employment within the Group. No Executive Directors participated in these arrangements. 
Past Directors 
The Committee exercised its discretion, in accordance with the rules of the ESOS, to permit Jake Ulrich to exercise his options up to six 
months from the third anniversary of the date on which an option was last granted to him i.e. at any time before 3 October 2009. All of 
his options were exercised before this date. Under the Sharesave rules, his outstanding options were exercisable until 31 January 2009, 
and were exercised before this date.

The graph above compares the Company's TSR performance with that of the FTSE 100 Index for the five years ended 31 December 2009 
as required by Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. A rolling 
definition of the FTSE 100 has been used. This is not the same as the definition used for the purposes of the LTIS. 
Directors' pensions 
Of the five Executive Directors who served during 2009, Phil Bentley and Chris Weston are members of the Centrica Pension Plan (CPP) 
which was formerly known as the Centrica Management Pension Scheme (CMPS). Mark Hanafin, Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff, who all 
joined the Company in recent years, are not members of any of Centrica's pension schemes.  
Centrica Pension Plan (CPP) 
The CPP is a funded, HMRC-registered, final salary, contributory occupational pension scheme. Its rules have the following main 
features: 
  normal retirement at age 62; 
  right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service after age 60 at own request with employer consent, or on leaving service 
at the Company's request after age 55;  
  life assurance cover of four times pensionable earnings for death in service; 
  spouse's pension on death in service payable at the rate of 50% of the member's prospective pension and, on death after retirement, 
half of the accrued pension. Children's pensions on death are also payable at 25% of the member's prospective pension at normal 
retirement age; 
  members' contributions payable at the rate of 6% of pensionable earnings. Contributions made by the Executive Directors who are 
also members of the Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme (CUPS) are payable at the rate of 6% of their total pensionable earnings 
above the scheme earnings cap;  
  pension payable in the event of retirement due to ill health; 
  pensions in payment and in deferment guaranteed to increase in line with the increase in the RPI (a maximum of 6% applies to 
pension accrued after 6 April 2004); and 
  no discretionary practices are taken into account in calculating transfer values.

Centrica Unfunded Pension Scheme (CUPS) 
All registered scheme benefits are subject to HMRC guidelines. As a result of the changes introduced by Centrica following the 2004 
Finance Act, benefits at 6 April 2006 from the registered scheme, the CPP, could not exceed the Lifetime Allowance ( 1.75 million for 
the 2009/10 tax year) after taking account of retained benefits from all other sources notified to Centrica at this time. The CUPS provides 
any additional benefits in excess of the maximum amount that could be provided through the CPP on the members' uncapped 
pensionable earnings. The benefits that arise under CUPS are treated as being subject to the same rules as apply in respect of the 
registered portion of members' benefits. No individuals will receive benefits from Centrica which, when added to their retained benefits 
elsewhere at 6 April 2006, exceed two-thirds of their final pensionable earnings. CUPS is unfunded but the benefits are secured by a 
charge over certain Centrica assets. An appropriate provision in respect of the accrued value of these benefits has been made in the 
Company's Balance Sheet.

Notes on information shown in the table 
  The accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age 62, based on eligible service to, and pensionable earnings at, 31 December 2009.  
The pension accrual rates for 2009 for Phil Bentley and Chris Weston were 2.65% and 2.22% of final pensionable earnings respectively.  For Chris Weston the increase in 
the accrued pension covers the period since his appointment to the Board on 1 July 2009. 
  As at 31 December 2008 the accrued pension for Chris Weston as an employee of the Group was  68,700. 
  The figures shown for the increase in the accrued pension excludes inflation as the annual rate to 30 September 2009 was below the minimum of 0.0%. This is consistent 
with the rate used for pension increases for the CPP and CUPS.
