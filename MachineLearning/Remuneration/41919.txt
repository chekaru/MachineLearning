 Governance // Remuneration Report
50
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration 
Committee' s Report for 2010 for which we will be seeking approval 
from shareholders at our Annual General Meeting in May 2011. 
The management team has made a great deal of progress towards 
achieving our strategic goals in what has been a very challenging 
year, as highlighted in the Chairman' s statement on pages 2 and 3. 
The strong financial and operational performance achieved in 2010 
and the measurable progress made towards the strategic priorities 
were achieved by meeting demanding performance objectives. The 
Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the overall remuneration 
for the Executive Directors, as set out in the following pages, is 
appropriate given the performance of the business for the year.  
The performance targets for 2011 are similarly challenging and 
aligned with the delivery of value to shareholders. T aking into 
account external economic conditions, the Committee has agreed 
that none of the Executive Directors will receive a salary increase in 
the 2011 calendar year. 
In considering remuneration for our senior executives, the 
Remuneration Committee has used the framework of principles 
established last year in its review of executive remuneration: 
  Incentives will reinforce key business objectives, promote an 
ownership culture, and align executive and shareholder interests. 
  Senior executive remuneration levels will be benchmarked and 
structured to ensure that Centrica' s total remuneration (i.e. 
including all fixed and variable pay) is competitive.  
  The Remuneration Committee will take into account both best 
practice and employment conditions throughout Centrica when 
determining the appropriate structure of executive remuneration. 
  A significant proportion of senior executive remuneration will be 
delivered through long-term share-based pay. 
  Incentive structures will be simple, transparent and robust, and 
structured to avoid encouraging excessive risk-taking. 
  Annual incentives will be based on Group, business unit, Health, 
Safety & Environment and individual performance.  
  Long-term incentives will be aligned with the wider interests 
of shareholders. 
  Incentive targets may be adjusted at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee to take account of  non-performance 
items' outside management control that would otherwise distort 
the measurement of management performance. 
Review of executive remuneration 
During the year the Committee reviewed our executive remuneration 
arrangements and considered their alignment with the Group' s 
strategic priorities. In light of the prevailing economic climate, the 
Committee concluded that no changes would be made at the 
present time, but that we would continue to keep the situation 
under review. 
Managing the balance of amount and risk 
The Committee asked the Head of Audit & Risk to consider links 
between risk and remuneration within Centrica. We do not believe 
the remuneration arrangements encourage excessive risk-taking. 
We will continue to monitor the situation. 
Talent and reward 
We have a strong senior management team in place and we are 
keen to attract and retain high calibre individuals to lead the Group. 
We will continue to benchmark the remuneration of our senior 
executives against a UK cross-industry comparator group. We will 
also take into account international comparators within our industry 
and the reward structures in place throughout the Group. 
T wo Non-Executive Directors have been appointed to the 
Committee since the last Report. Ian Meakins joined during 2010 
and Margherita Della Valle joined in January 2011, each following 
their appointment to the Board. 
The Remuneration Committee continues to be committed to 
ensuring executive remuneration is structured so that it supports the 
future direction of the business, is aligned to our values and is in the 
best interests of shareholders.

This Report details the Company' s executive remuneration policy 
and includes information on the remuneration of the Directors for 
the financial year ended 31 December 2010. 
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is a committee 
of the Board. Its terms of reference are available from the General 
Counsel & Company Secretary and are also published on the 
Company' s website www.centrica.com. 
The principal role of the Committee is to determine and make 
recommendations to the Board on the Company' s framework and 
broad policy for the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board, 
the Company' s Executive Directors and other senior executives. 
The Committee' s Report will be presented to the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting (AGM) for approval. It explains how the 
Company has applied the principles of the Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance (the Code) that relate to Directors' 
remuneration during the year. No Director is involved in the 
determination of, or votes on, any matter relating to his or her 
own remuneration. 
Throughout 2010 Helen Alexander was Chairman of the Committee 
and Sir Roger Carr, Mary Francis, Andrew Mackenzie and Paul 
Rayner were members of the Committee. Ian Meakins became a 
member of the Committee when he joined the Board on 1 October 
2010. The Board has determined that each of the Non-Executive 
Directors who are members of the Committee is independent. 
During 2010, the Committee had access to the advice and views of: 
  the Group Director, Human Resources; 
  the Group Director, Reward; 
  the Chief Executive;  
  the Head of Audit & Risk; 
  the General Counsel & Company Secretary; 
  Kepler Associates (Kepler), who acted as independent external 
adviser to the Committee during the year;  
  Deloitte & T ouche LLP (Deloitte) who were consulted during the 
year and were formally appointed as the Committee' s 
independent external adviser with effect from 1 January 2011; 
and 
  T owers Watson who were consulted but not formally appointed 
as advisers to the Committee. 
Kepler did not provide any other advice to the Company. Deloitte 
was consulted as part of the review of senior executive 
remuneration, ahead of their appointment as external adviser to 
the Committee and also provide a number of consulting services 
throughout the Group. T owers Watson provided actuarial services to 
the Company. The Committee took into account the Remuneration 
Consultants Group' s Code of Conduct when appointing Deloitte as 
adviser to the Committee. 
Key issues reviewed by the Remuneration Committee 
In 2010 the Committee met eight times and considered a number 
of key issues. In particular it reviewed: 
  total remuneration, including base salaries for 2010; 
  the link between risk and remuneration; 
  amendments to the rules of the Long T erm Incentive Scheme 
(LTIS) and Deferred and Matching Share Scheme (DMSS) to 
enable awards to be delivered as nil cost options; 
  senior executive remuneration (in conjunction with advisers); and 
  appointment of Deloitte as external adviser to the Committee with 
effect from 1 January 2011. 
Regular items reviewed by the Remuneration Committee 
The Committee regularly considers a number of items which, 
for 2010, included: 
  2009 Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS) payments; 
  Executive Directors' AIS objectives for 2010; 
  2009 Remuneration Report; 
  vesting for 2007 LTIS and DMSS awards; 
  allocation of 2010 LTIS and DMSS awards; 
  annual valuation of the Centrica Unapproved Pension 
Scheme (CUPS); and 
  draft Executive Directors' AIS objectives for 2011.

The following sections outline the policy and framework surrounding 
the Executive Directors' remuneration. 
The Committee believes alignment between Centrica' s business 
strategy and the remuneration of its Executive Directors and senior 
executives is essential.  
  The fixed elements of our remuneration packages are 
competitive, but not excessive, against the markets in which we 
compete for talent. This avoids building unnecessary current and 
future costs into the business.  
  A significant proportion of the total remuneration opportunity 
continues to depend upon delivering business performance in line 
with the strategic priorities. T otal remuneration will increase with 
strong performance and decrease if the business performs poorly. 
  Short-term incentives are focused on delivery against 
strategically-aligned performance measures, determined on a 
role-by-role basis. These include demanding financial and non-
financial business-related objectives.  
  Longer-term incentives reward the creation of shareholder value 
over a three to four-year period. Performance is measured using 
a combination of earnings per share (EPS) growth, relative total 
shareholder return (TSR) performance and Group economic 
profit (EP) growth. 
The remuneration policy aims to deliver a remuneration package:  
  that will attract and retain Executive Directors and other senior 
executives in a challenging business environment that is 
competitive in both commercial and human resource terms; 
  that delivers an appropriate balance between fixed and variable 
compensation for each executive; 
  in which a significant proportion depends on the attainment of 
demanding performance objectives, both short and long term;  
  that provides a strong alignment with the achievement of strategic 
objectives and the delivery of value to shareholders; and 
  that seeks to avoid creating excessive risks in the achievement 
of performance targets. 
The remuneration framework reflects current best practice, including 
the provisions on the design of performance-related remuneration 
as set out in the Code, while meeting the Group' s particular 
business needs: 
  the Committee reviews the packages and varies individual 
elements, when appropriate, from year to year; 
  in agreeing the level of base salaries and the performance- 
related elements of the remuneration package, the Committee 
considers the potential maximum remuneration that executives 
could receive; 
  the Committee takes account of, and is sensitive to, employment 
conditions throughout the Company, and to the current economic 
climate as a whole; 
  the AIS is designed to incentivise and reward the achievement 
of demanding financial and business-related objectives; and 
  long-term share-based incentives are designed to align the 
interests of Executive Directors and other senior executives with 
the longer-term interests of Centrica' s shareholders, by rewarding 
them for delivering sustained, increased shareholder value. 
In 2010, the total remuneration package of the Executive Directors 
comprised elements in the following proportions: 
A minimum shareholding policy requires the retention of a value 
of shares as follows: 
  Chief Executive - 2 times base salary; 
  other Executive Directors - 1.25 times base salary; and 
  other Executive Committee members - 1 times base salary. 
The Executive Directors and Executive Committee members have 
achieved, and in some cases materially exceeded, their minimum 
shareholding requirements. 
Mark Hanafin and Sam Laidlaw are entitled under the terms of their 
contracts of employment to receive a salary supplement in lieu of 
pension of 40% of base salary. Nick Luff' s entitlement was increased 
from 30% to 40% of base salary, with effect from April 2010.  
The salary supplements are paid in cash, with the exception of part 
of the supplement for Sam Laidlaw which is paid directly into his 
personal pension plan. The cash amounts paid in the year directly 
to individuals are disclosed within the Directors' emoluments table 
on page 58.  
Phil Bentley and Chris Weston participate in the Centrica Pension 
Plan (CPP) (a contributory final salary arrangement) and in the 
Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme (CUPS). Full disclosure 
of the pension arrangements for the Executive Directors is given 
on page 63. 
The total emoluments of the three remaining members of the 
Executive Committee during 2010, calculated on the same basis 
as the emoluments of the Executive Directors detailed on page 58, 
fell into the following bands:

The AIS provides a focus on the delivery of the financial targets 
set out in the operating plan. It rewards the achievement of 
strategic priorities for the year that position the Group well for 
strong future performance and the delivery of HS&E and 
personal objectives. 
Reflects the role and the sustained value of the individual in terms 
of skills, experience and contribution. 
How pay and employment conditions across the Group are 
taken into account when setting the remuneration of the 
Executive Directors 
 
The Group operates in a number of different environments and 
has many employees who carry out diverse jobs across a number 
of countries.  
  All employees, including directors, are paid by reference to the  
market rate. 
  Performance is measured and rewarded through a number 
of performance-related bonus schemes across the Group. 
  Business unit performance measures are cascaded down 
through the organisation. 
  The Group offers employment conditions which are 
commensurate with a large listed company, including high 
standards of health and safety and equal opportunities. 
  The Group operates all-employee share plans which are open 
to all employees and Executive Directors alike. 
  The Group offers a range of benefits which are available 
to everyone. 
The Committee establishes base salaries for the Executive Directors 
and other senior executives, determined by individual performance 
and having regard to market salary levels for similar positions in 
comparable companies and wider pay awards across the Group. 
Base salaries are reviewed annually. 
In 2010, the Chief Executive was awarded a base salary increase 
of 3.8%. All other Executive Directors were awarded increases 
averaging between 2.0% and 8.9%. 
No base salary increases will be awarded to the Executive 
Directors in the calendar year 2011, reflecting the current 
economic conditions. 
Annual performance measures in 2010 
The annual performance metrics used in the AIS in 2010 were 
designed to reward the delivery of our key strategic priorities for 
that year.

Assists with employee retention and incentivises the creation 
of long-term value for shareholders and delivery of sustained 
high performance. 
In 2010, the primary financial measure was EP growth and each 
business unit had a number of metrics focusing on their key 
strategic priorities for the year: cost reduction targets, operating 
reliability and customer satisfaction levels.  
Further, each business unit head, Phil Bentley, Mark Hanafin, Chris 
Weston and the General Counsel & Company Secretary had an 
individual business unit target based on business unit EP growth. 
A separate HS&E metric for 2010 was applied to each of the above, 
as well as to the Chief Executive and a number of the executives 
immediately below Board level. 
HS&E performance was assessed against a corporate responsibility 
scorecard that includes HS&E performance indicators and incident 
rates. If overall business performance, including HS&E performance 
is not deemed satisfactory, the individual' s bonus for the year may 
be reduced or forfeited, at the discretion of the Committee. 
Annual incentive opportunities in 2010 
At the beginning of each year, the Committee reviews the AIS to 
ensure that the incentive opportunity remains competitive in the 
marketplace. There was no change to the target and maximum 
bonus opportunity for 2010. These, as well as the relative 
proportions of the components that made up the target bonus 
opportunity, were as follows:  
 
 
 
Performance for 2010 
The annual bonus outcomes of the 2010 AIS were determined 
by performance against each of the metrics used. Annual bonus 
outcomes in respect of 2010 performance, before the compulsory 
deferral into Centrica shares outlined below, ranged from 135% to 
158% of base salary and between 181% and 195% of on-target 
performance, for the Executive Directors and Chief Executive. For 
2011, the bonus opportunity for on-target performance will remain 
unchanged at 90% of base salary for the Chief Executive, and 75% 
of base salary for the other Executive Directors. 
Deferral of annual incentives 
Part of an Executive Director' s AIS award will be compulsorily 
deferred and invested in the DMSS (see below). 40% of any AIS 
award for the Chief Executive and 30% for Executive Directors and 
executives immediately below Board level will be deferred.  
 
Compulsory deferral 
Part of the bonus earned under AIS for the previous year is 
compulsorily deferred into Centrica shares (deferred shares). If these 
shares are held for three years the deferred shares will be matched 
to the extent that a long-term performance condition is met. 
Voluntary deferral 
Executives may make an additional voluntary deferral of AIS into 
Centrica shares (investment shares). The maximum total deferral 
that may be made, including the compulsory deferral, is up to 50% 
of the maximum annual incentive opportunity which may be earned 
for a year.

Rewards long-term value creation via longer-term earnings, share price and dividend growth, and the delivery of total returns  
to shareholders. 
Performance measures attaching to the DMSS awards 
The performance conditions attaching to DMSS awards made for 2008, 2009 and 2010 are shown in the table below. 
Share matching 
Share matching increases on a straight-line basis from zero 
matching for no EP growth to a maximum of 2 for 1 matching 
for three-year EP growth of 25% or more.  
For the purposes of matching, the investment shares are grossed 
up for income tax and employee' s National Insurance contributions. 
T o provide a closer alignment with the interests of Centrica' s 
shareholders, the number of matching shares that are released will 
be increased to reflect the dividends that would have been paid 
during the three-year performance period on the matching shares 
that vest.  
In the event of a change of control, the number of matching 
shares that vest will be subject to time-apportionment in line 
with best practice.  
For awards made in 2010 matched shares were structured 
as nil-cost options for all UK resident participants. 
Under the LTIS conditional allocations of shares up to a maximum of 200% of base salary may be made to Executive Directors and other 
senior executives. In 2010, LTIS allocations equal to 200% of base salary were awarded to Executive Directors and, at lower levels, to other 
senior executives. The performance measures attaching to the LTIS awards made for 2008, 2009 and 2010 are shown in the table below.  
 
(i) EPS is the Group's diluted adjusted earnings per share.

between these points 
Level at which shares are matched depends on growth in 
cumulative EP performance 
  2 for 1 match for cumulative EP growth of 25% or more

The maximum number of shares that could be transferred to each 
Executive Director upon satisfaction of the performance conditions 
appears on page 59. 
In assessing the extent to which the performance conditions have 
been met, the Committee uses data provided by Alithos Limited 
(an independent third party) for comparative TSR performance and 
audited results for EPS performance. The TSR graph for the LTIS 
award that vested in April 2010 is shown on page 61. 
The Committee also reviews whether the extent to which the 
performance conditions have been achieved is a genuine reflection 
of the Company' s underlying financial performance.  
T o the extent that the performance condition is met, the number 
of shares that are released will be increased to reflect the dividends 
that would have been paid on those shares during the three-year 
performance period.  
Details of the vesting for LTIS awards made in 2007 are included 
on page 61.  
Each year, before making LTIS awards, the Committee considers 
the performance conditions attaching to them, to ensure that they 
are aligned with the challenging growth and cost reduction targets 
inherent in the strategic plan.  
The measurement of TSR was amended in 2010 so that the 
Group' s TSR would be measured as a percentage out-performance 
of the FTSE 100 Index. Vesting will increase on a straight-line basis 
between 25% and 100% for out-performance of between 0.1% and 
7% per annum.  
In respect of LTIS awards in 2010 these were structured as nil-cost 
options for all UK resident participants. 
No grants of options under the ESOS were made during 2010. 
Details of options granted prior to 2010 and still held by Executive 
Directors are shown on page 62. 
If, and to the extent that, performance conditions are satisfied, 
options normally become exercisable three years after the date of 
grant and remain so until the tenth anniversary of the grant date. 
It is the Company' s intention to satisfy the requirements of its share 
schemes by a method best suited to the interests of the Company, 
either by acquiring shares in the market or, subject to institutional 
guidelines, issuing new shares or using shares held in treasury. T o 
satisfy the release of shares under the DMSS and LTIS and to meet 
the requirements of the ESOS in 2010, newly-issued shares were 
used. Shares previously bought in the market are held in trust to 
satisfy outstanding allocations made under the DMSS (deferred and 
investment shares) and the Special Executive Share Option Scheme 
(SESOS). 
In common with other senior management, Executive Directors 
are entitled to a range of benefits, including a company car, life 
assurance premiums, private medical insurance, health screening 
and a financial counselling scheme. During the year, Sam Laidlaw 
was also provided with a driver for limited personal mileage. Nick 
Luff is provided with a cash allowance in lieu of a company car. 
Such benefits are subject to financial limits as set out in 
appropriate policies. 
Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Company' s 
HMRC-approved Sharesave Scheme and Share Incentive Plan, 
which are open to all eligible UK employees on the same basis, 
providing a long-term savings and investment opportunity. 
All taxable benefits arising from employment by the Company have 
been included in the  Benefits and other cash' column of the table 
shown on page 58. 
It is the Company' s policy that the notice period in Executive 
Directors' service contracts does not exceed one year. The 
Executive Directors' service contracts have no fixed term but 
provide that either the Director or the Company may terminate the 
employment by giving one year' s written notice and that the 
Company may pay compensation in lieu of notice.  
On a change of control, conditional awards under DMSS and LTIS 
will vest to the extent that the performance conditions will have been 
met at the vesting date and pro-rated for the time elapsed since the 
start of each performance period, until the vesting date, subject to 
the overriding discretion of the Committee. 
In the case of new external appointments to the Board, the 
Committee retains a level of flexibility, as permitted by the Code, in 
order to attract and retain suitable candidates. It therefore reserves 
the right to offer contracts which contain an initial notice period in 
excess of one year, provided that at the end of the first such period 
the notice period reduces to one year. The Committee exercised this 
discretion in respect of the appointment of Mark Hanafin on 14 July 
2008. His service contract contained a notice period of two years, 
which reduced to one year on the second anniversary of his date of 
appointment in 2010.

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 57
 
 
The Board believes that experience of other companies' practices 
and challenges is valuable both for the personal development of its 
Executive Directors and for the Company.  
It is therefore the Company' s policy to allow each Executive Director 
to accept one non-executive directorship of another company, 
although the Board retains the discretion to vary this policy. Fees 
received in respect of external appointments are retained by the 
individual Director. 
In 2010, Phil Bentley received  15,083 as a non-executive director 
of Kingfisher plc until March 2010 and Nick Luff received  47,000 
as a non-executive director of QinetiQ Group plc until 31 December 
2010. Sam Laidlaw received  85,000 as a non-executive director of 
HSBC Holdings plc and from December 2010 was also appointed 
as lead non-executive director of the Department of Transport and 
has waived his right to receive a fee. 
Centrica' s policy on Non-Executive Directors' fees takes into 
account the need to attract individuals of the right calibre and 
experience, their responsibilities and time commitment and the level 
of fees paid by other companies. 
The fee levels for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors, which 
had remained unchanged since 2007, were reviewed and increased 
in May 2010. The increases reflected the growing demands on 
Non-Executive Directors' time.  
The annual fees payable to the Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors are in the table below.  
The Non-Executive Directors (including the Chairman) do not 
participate in any of the Company' s share schemes, incentive plans 
or pension schemes. 
Non-Executive Directors (including the Chairman) do not have 
service contracts. Their appointment is subject to the Articles of 
Association and the dates they joined the Board are shown in the 
table on page 58. Sir Roger Carr' s letter of appointment contains 
a six-month notice period. The Chairman' s fees are reviewed and 
approved by the Remuneration Committee. The fees of the Non-
Executive Directors are approved by the Executive Committee, 
whose current members are: the Executive Directors (Sam Laidlaw, 
Phil Bentley, Mark Hanafin, Nick Luff and Chris Weston) and three 
other senior executives (Grant Dawson, Catherine May and Anne 
Minto) all of whose biographies are included on pages 38 and 39. 
Mark Hanafin was appointed to the Board on 14 July 2008. 
A one-off allocation was made to him under the Special Long T erm 
Incentive Scheme (SLTIS) to replace awards from his previous 
employer, in accordance with the terms of his engagement. The 
SLTIS rules were based on the existing LTIS rules, subject only to 
continued employment. An allocation of shares was made to vest 
in two equal tranches which vested on 28 February 2009 and 
2010 respectively.  
A grant of unapproved options was also made to him under the 
SESOS in 2008 to replace awards from his previous employer, in 
accordance with the terms of his engagement. The SESOS rules 
were based on the existing ESOS rules. However, in accordance 
with the rules of the SESOS, the grant is not subject to any 
performance conditions, is exercisable immediately and will remain 
so until the tenth anniversary of the grant date. 
Phil Bentley' s role as Managing Director, British Gas, broadened 
significantly in 2009 and in recognition of this change he received 
an increase in his base salary. In addition, a commitment was made 
that if he remains with the Group at least until January 2012, the 
accrued value of his pension under CPP will be increased 
progressively over time.

Notes on information shown in the table 
(i) Ian Meakins was appointed to the Board on 1 October 2010. 
(ii) Executive Directors' shareholdings shown above include those held in the Share Incentive Plan and the deferred and investment shares held in the DMSS. Due to local tax laws in Canada, 
shareholdings for Chris Weston include 54,898 notional deferred shares allocated for 2010 under the DMSS. These shares will remain notional until the end of the three-year deferral period. 
(iii) Matching shares held in the DMSS and shares held under the LTIS are provided separately in the table above and in more detail in their respective tables on pages 60 and 61. From 2010, 
matching shares awarded under the DMSS and shares awarded under the LTIS have been structured as nil-cost options for all UK resident participants.
From 1 January 2010 to 24 February 2011, none of the Directors had any interests in the securities of the Company' s subsidiary or 
associated undertakings. 
Changes since 1 January 2011 
During the period from 1 January to 24 February 2011, the only changes to the Directors' interests in shares were in respect of shares

Notes on information shown in the DMSS tables 
(i) Allocations for 2007 and 2008 were adjusted to take account of the dilutive effect of the Rights Issue in 2008. 
(ii) At allocation the calculation of the conditional matching shares is made on a gross basis. For the calculation of the matching shares, investment shares are grossed up (to reflect the impact 
of income tax and employee's National Insurance contributions (NICs)) so that the deferred and investment shares are matched on the same basis. The number of matching shares that will be 
released following the satisfaction of the performance condition will be increased to reflect the dividends that would have been paid during the three-year performance period, as if they had been 
paid on the normal dividend payment dates. Dividends are paid on the deferred and investment shares to the participants on the normal dividend payment date.  
(iii) DMSS conditional matching shares granted in April 2007 were subject to cumulative EP growth. As at 31 December 2009, the Company's cumulative EP growth over the three-year performance 
period was 44% and as a result the conditional matching shares vested in full on a two for one basis. Additional shares (26,933 for Phil Bentley, 40,376 for Sam Laidlaw, 25,176 for Nick Luff and 
9,307 for Chris Weston) were released to reflect the value of dividends that would have been paid on the matching shares during the three-year performance period. On release, the deferred and 
matching shares were subject to income tax at the individual's marginal rate and employee's NICs at the rate of 1%, based on the market value of the shares on 6 April 2010 (296.89 pence) 
being the lower of the two dealing days immediately prior to and after the date of vesting which was not a dealing day. The income tax and NICs liability was satisfied by the sale of sufficient 
shares and accordingly, the Executive Directors only received the net number of shares following the sale along with the transfer of their investment shares, which to the extent retained, is 
reflected in the shareholdings as at 31 December 2010 on page 59. 
(iv) In 2008 the operation of DMSS was delayed due to the Executive Directors and other senior executives being subject to prolonged dealing restrictions under the Company's Share Dealing Code. 
20% of the AIS paid in April 2008 was deferred automatically. The investment in deferred and investment shares and the conditional award of matching shares were made on 13 October 2008, 
once the Company had ceased to be in a prohibited period.  
(v) In 2009 40% of the AIS paid to Sam Laidlaw, and 30% for the other Executive Directors, was deferred automatically. The investment in deferred shares and the conditional award of matching 
shares were made on 3 April 2009. The voluntary element of the DMSS was delayed due to the Executive Directors and other senior executives being subject to dealing restrictions under the 
Company's Share Dealing Code. The purchase of investment shares and the conditional award of matching shares were made on 26 May 2009, once the Company had ceased to be in a 
prohibited period. 
(vi) In 2010 the award of matching shares were structured as nil-cost options for all UK resident participants. In respect of Chris Weston, who is based in Toronto, no deferred shares were acquired. 
Due to local tax laws, these must only be held as a notional entitlement. In this respect, 54,898 shares are included above.

Notes on information shown in the table 
(i) LTIS awards made in April 2007 were subject to EPS and TSR performance conditions. As at 31 December 2009, the Company's EPS growth had exceeded RPI by 39% and as a result 99.1% 
of the EPS shares allocated vested for the Executive Directors in post at the time of allocation (Phil Bentley, Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff) as a more stretching EPS target was set in respect of one 
quarter of the EPS shares. For Chris Weston, 100% of EPS shares vested. At the end of the performance period to 3 April 2010, the Company ranked 52
nd
 against the FTSE 100 comparator 
group as constituted at the start of the performance period and as a result zero TSR shares vested. Consequently, overall 49.5% and 50% respectively of the original allocations were released 
on 4 April 2010.  
(ii) Additional shares were released to reflect the value of the dividends that would have been paid over the respective three-year period. The total shares released were subject to income tax at the 
individual's marginal rate and employee's National Insurance contributions (NICs) at the rate of 1%, based on the market value of the shares at the date of vesting. The income tax and NICs 
liability was satisfied by the sale of sufficient shares and, accordingly, the Executive Directors only received the net number of shares following the sale, which, to the extent retained, is reflected 
in the shareholdings as at 31 December 2010 on page 59. 
(iii) 188,260 shares (made in two equal tranches) were awarded to Mark Hanafin under SLTIS as part of the terms of his appointment in 2008. In accordance with the rules of the SLTIS there were 
no performance conditions attaching to the award other than continued employment with the Company. The second tranche of 94,130 shares were released on 1 March 2010 and were subject

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 63
 
 
Of the five Executive Directors who served during 2010, Phil Bentley and Chris Weston are members of the Centrica Pension Plan (CPP). 
Mark Hanafin, Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff, who all joined the Company in recent years, are not members of any of Centrica' s 
pension schemes.  
Centrica Pension Plan (CPP) 
The CPP is a funded, HMRC-registered, final salary, contributory occupational pension scheme. Its rules have the following main features: 
  normal retirement at age 62; 
  right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service after age 60 at own request with employer consent, or on leaving service at 
the Company' s request after age 55;  
  life assurance cover of four times pensionable earnings for death in service; 
  spouse' s pension on death in service payable at the rate of 50% of the member' s prospective pension and, on death after retirement, 
half of the accrued pension. Children' s pensions on death are also payable at 25% of the member' s prospective pension at normal 
retirement age; 
  members' contributions payable at the rate of 6% of pensionable earnings. Contributions made by the Executive Directors who are also 
members of the Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme (CUPS) are payable at the rate of 6% of their total pensionable earnings above 
the scheme earnings cap;  
  pension payable in the event of retirement due to ill health; 
  pensions in payment and in deferment guaranteed to increase in line with the increase in the RPI (a maximum of 6% applies to pension 
accrued after 6 April 2004); and 
  no discretionary practices are taken into account in calculating transfer values. 
Centrica Unfunded Pension Scheme (CUPS) 
All registered scheme benefits are subject to HMRC guidelines. As a result of the changes introduced by Centrica following the 2004 
Finance Act, benefits at 6 April 2006 from the registered scheme, the CPP , could not exceed the Lifetime Allowance ( 1.8 million for the 
2010/11 tax year) after taking account of retained benefits from all other sources notified to Centrica at this time. The CUPS provides any 
additional benefits in excess of the maximum amount that could be provided through the CPP on the members' uncapped pensionable 
earnings. The benefits that arise under CUPS are treated as being subject to the same rules that apply in respect of the registered portion 
of members' benefits. No individuals will receive benefits from Centrica which, when added to their retained benefits elsewhere at  
6 April 2006, exceed two-thirds of their final pensionable earnings. CUPS is unfunded but the benefits are secured by a charge over  
certain Centrica assets. An appropriate provision in respect of the accrued value of these benefits has been made in the Company's 
Balance Sheet.

Notes on information shown in the table 
(i) The accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age 62, based on eligible service to, and pensionable earnings at, 31 December 2010. The pension accrual rates for 
2010 for Phil Bentley and Chris Weston were 2.65% and 2.22% of final pensionable earnings respectively.  
(ii) The increase in accrued pension has been adjusted to exclude inflation by revaluing the accrued pension as at 31 December 2009 by the rate of inflation (4.6%) and deducting this from the 
accrued pension as at 31 December 2010. The rate of inflation used was 4.6%, the annual rate to 30 September 2010, the date used for pension increases under both the CPP and CUPS. 
(iii) The change in the transfer value calculation basis was also introduced in August 2010. Had the transfer value been calculated on the accrued pension at 31 December 2010 but using the 
calculation basis in force at 31 December 2009, the transfer value of the accrued pension would have amounted to  2,709,700 for Phil Bentley and  1,118,600 for Chris Weston. The difference 
in the transfer value less contributions would have amounted to  425,100 for Phil Bentley and  211,550 for Chris Weston.
