 THE COMMITTEE AIMS TO PROVIDE 
CLEAR, TRANSPARENT REPORTING 
OF PERFORMANCE AND RESULTING 
REMUNERATION.  
Lesley Knox
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
 
On behalf of the Board I am pleased 
to present the Remuneration 
Committee's report for 2012.  
The report has been designed to move towards the new 
requirements for remuneration reporting, as proposed 
by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) 
as part of their consultation process, and also to comply 
with existing requirements. 
As we move towards separate votes on remuneration policy 
and the implementation of that policy, as required by the proposed 
new rules, we will look to segment the report so that 
it is clear which aspects shareholders will be asked to approve. 
This year we have included a two page quick view summary 
of performance targets, outcomes, total remuneration opportunity 
and total remuneration received in 2012 for Executive Directors, 
together with the prior year for comparison purposes. The 
Committee aims to provide clear, transparent reporting of 
performance and resulting remuneration and believes that 
this report meets that objective. 
As noted in the 2011 Remuneration Report, during the first 
quarter of 2012, the Committee adjusted the measurement 
and weighting of the key performance drivers within the existing 
incentive arrangements. We also introduced a formal mechanism 
for clawback of deferred rewards if it is subsequently discovered 
that results have been achieved by behaviour which fails to reflect 
the governance and values of the business. We have engaged 
with a number of shareholders during the year on our remuneration 
arrangements and remain committed to holding early discussions 
with shareholders in advance of any future changes. 
T otal variable earnings opportunity in 2012 remained unchanged 
from last year and the performance targets were both stretching 
and aligned with the Group' s strategic objectives. The key 
performance drivers are based on simple measures and the 
arrangements require substantial deferral of short-term reward. 
As we move forward the Committee intends to continue to strive 
for greater simplicity and transparency , to ensure alignment 
between the Group' s strategic direction and the measures of 
performance, and to maintain a responsible approach to both fixed 
and variable remuneration, which respects both the social climate 
in which we operate and the demands of our business model.
