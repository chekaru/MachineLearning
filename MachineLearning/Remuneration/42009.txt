The Committee is 
working towards  
greater simplicity  
and transparency  
in remuneration  
plan design.
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present the 
Remuneration Committee's report for 2013.
My summary of the year extends over the following two pages and includes  
a quick overview of performance targets, outcomes, the total remuneration 
opportunity and total remuneration received in respect of the 2013 performance 
year for Executive Directors, together with the prior year for comparison purposes.
Total variable earnings opportunity in 2013 remained unchanged from the  
prior year. However, the prior year figures for both opportunity and actual 
remuneration received have been restated to ensure the presentation complies 
with the most recent legislation finalised during the year.
For 2013, the results achievement has fallen below the stretching targets set by  
the Committee for British Gas, Direct Energy, Centrica Storage and the Group as  
a whole. Centrica Energy exceeded its 2013 operating plan targets following  
a particularly strong performance in midstream and power generation.
Performance against long-term targets for the three-year period ending with 2013 
failed to meet the minimum threshold and, therefore, none of the awards originally 
granted in 2011 will vest. Total shareholder return (TSR) performance exceeded  
the FTSE 100 Index throughout the majority of the performance period. However, 
proposals for future price controls and the potential for further political intervention 
had a material detrimental impact on the Group's share price in the final quarter  
of the year. The Committee considered the formulaic result in the context of the 
current climate and alignment with shareholder experience and decided not to 
exercise any discretion in favour of the impacted executives.
The Committee noted Sam Laidlaw's personal desire to donate any annual 
incentive award for the year to charity and took the necessary steps to facilitate 
that. As a result, Sam will not be required to defer the usually mandatory portion 
(40%) of his Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS) award and will instead donate the 
entire award received in cash.
The Board accepted Nick Luff's resignation on 7 January 2014 and he is working 
through his notice period. In accordance with the rules of the AIS, as Nick tendered 
his resignation prior to the award date for the 2013 performance year, any award  
is forfeited unless the Committee decides otherwise. Having considered the matter 
carefully and in the context of his contribution to the Group and consistent high 
individual performance, the Committee determined that Nick would receive an 
award in respect of 2013 performance. However, in accordance with policy set  
by the Committee in 2011, the portion of his award that ordinarily would be 
mandatorily deferred, being 30%, would be forfeited. The Committee also 
confirmed that in accordance with its policy, Nick would not be eligible for  
an annual incentive award for the 2014 year.

The Committee monitors the relationship between the Directors' total remuneration and cash outflows to other stakeholders. As demonstrated 
by the chart below, the Directors' aggregate total remuneration for the year equates to 0.1% (2012: 0.2%) of the Group's operating cash flow.

f utur E PoLicy
As noted in the 2012 Remuneration Report and discussed with a number of shareholders during that year, the Committee is working  
towards greater simplicity and transparency in remuneration plan design and will present a new set of arrangements for discussion with 
shareholders during 2014 prior to seeking shareholder approval at the AGM in 2015 when the current plans approach the end of their  
ten-year life. Therefore, whilst the Committee is seeking formal approval for the current policy as set out on pages 68 to 75 of this report, 
it is anticipated that these arrangements will apply for only one further year.
The new arrangements are expected to be significantly more simple and maintain the existing underlying principle of requiring substantial 
deferral of short-term performance related reward to ensure alignment with the Group's strategic objectives and shareholder value creation.

The Remuneration Committee believes that our remuneration 
arrangements appropriately incentivise and reward strong 
performance and shareholder value creation, whilst ensuring 
behaviours remain consistent with Centrica's principles and values.
remuneration principles
The Remuneration Policy aims to deliver a remuneration package:
 	 to attract and retain high calibre Executive Directors (Executives)  
in a challenging and competitive business environment;
 	 that delivers an appropriate balance between fixed and variable 
compensation for each Executive;
 	 that places a strong emphasis on performance, both short 
and long-term;
 	 strongly aligned to the achievement of strategic objectives  
and the delivery of sustainable value to shareholders; and
 	 that seeks to avoid creating excessive risks in the achievement  
of performance targets.
reward framework and objectives
The core design of the total remuneration framework for Executives 
ensures that a substantial portion of the maximum opportunity is 
dependent upon performance as indicated below. Total remuneration 
comprises fixed pay and variable performance-related pay, which  
is further divided into short-term incentives (with a one-year 
performance period) and long-term incentives (with a three  
to four-year performance period).

In addition, Executives are subject to a minimum shareholding 
requirement, with holding periods of five years from grant or award  
date, to provide further alignment with the returns to our shareholders.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have been selected that align with  
and allow progress towards our vision: to be the leading integrated 
energy company with customers at our core and also support our 
strategic priorities. In addition, our underlying principles of operating 
safely and with an engaged workforce are measured.
The KPIs, which are set out in detail on pages 16 and 17, underpin 
the selection of performance criteria used within the incentive 
arrangements as demonstrated in the table below. If overall 
performance is not deemed satisfactory, the award for any year  
may be reduced or forfeited, at the discretion of the Committee.

t he key objectives
 	 The potential maximum remuneration that Executives could receive 
is a key consideration when agreeing the level of base pay and  
the performance related elements of the remuneration package;
 	 the Committee takes account of, and is sensitive to, shareholder 
views, market changes, skills availability, competitive pressure and/
or the economic climate when considering executive remuneration. 
In so doing, the Committee follows similar principles that apply 
when remuneration is considered for all other employees within  
the Group; and
 	 benchmarking against UK cross-industry comparator 
organisations of similar size and complexity is used to assist  
the Committee in evaluating market movement and the relative 
competitive position of executive remuneration to ensure that 
packages offered support the attraction and retention of high 
calibre individuals.

Company's strategy.
Base salaries are reviewed annually, taking account of performance, 
market conditions and pay in the Group as a whole. Changes are 
usually effective from 1 April each year. 
Current base salaries for the Chief Executive and the Group Finance

percentage terms 
will be in line with 
increases awarded 
to other employees 
of the Group. 
Increases may be

(calculated as a percentage of base salary, which is excluded from 
any bonus calculation) in lieu of pension entitlement.
The Group's policy is not to offer defined benefit arrangements to 
new employees at any level, unless this is specifically required by 
applicable legislation or an existing contractual agreement.

annual incentive 
Scheme (aiS)
Designed to reward  
the delivery of key 
strategic priorities  
for the year.
These priorities position 
the Group well for strong 
future performance, 
reinforcing the 
importance of balancing 
growth with economic 
profit returns in a 
business which is more 
vertically integrated  
and capital intensive.
AIS is designed to incentivise and reward the achievement of 
demanding financial and individual strategically aligned performance 
objectives.
A significant proportion of the AIS is required to be deferred into  
the Deferred and Matching Share Scheme (DMSS) for three years. 
Details of the DMSS are shown on page 71.
If overall business performance is not deemed satisfactory, an 
individual's AIS payment for the year may be reduced or forfeited,  
at the discretion of the Committee.
Chief Executive: 
0% to 180% of 
base salary.
Other Executive 
Directors: 
0% to 150% of 
base salary.
Half the maximum  
is payable for

Up to 40% based 
on individuals'

aligned to the 
Group's strategic 
priorities, with the 
remainder based 
on EP.
Assessed over 
one financial year.
all-employee 
share plans
Provide an opportunity 
for employees to 
voluntarily invest in 
the Company.
UK-based Executives are entitled to participate in the HMRC-
approved Sharesave and Share Incentive Plan (SIP) on the same 
terms as all other eligible employees. The Sharesave plan offers  
a three or five-year savings period, with up to a 20% discount to the 
market value of the shares at the point of grant. 
The SIP currently offers partnership and matching shares.  
Dividends paid on SIP shares may be reinvested in the plan.
Maximum contribution 
limits are set by 
legislation. Levels of 
participation allowed 
by the Board are 
within these limits 
and apply to all 
participants. The  
SIP currently awards 
one free matching 
share for every two 
partnership shares 
purchased, up to  
a maximum of 22 
matching shares  
per month, although 
the plan allows  
for higher levels 
of match.

DMSS
The Chief Executive is required to defer 40% of any AIS payment  
into the DMSS each year. All other Executive Directors are required  
to defer 30% of any AIS payment into the DMSS.
An additional voluntary deferral may be made, taking the total deferral 
to up to 50% of maximum bonus opportunity.
Up to two matching shares are awarded for each deferred share 
subject to performance over a three-year period. Matching awards 
for UK-based Executives are delivered as nil cost options at the end 
of the performance period and the options are exercisable for seven 
years. Matching awards for non UK-based Executives are structured 
as conditional share awards and shares are released at the end of 
the performance period.
Dividends are paid on the deferred shares during the three-year 
performance period. Notional dividend equivalents are calculated at 
the end of the performance period on any conditional matching share 
awards or at the point of exercise for nil cost options. Dividend 
equivalents are paid as additional shares or as cash.
All deferred awards can be clawed back if it is subsequently 
discovered that the results have been achieved by behaviour  
which fails to reflect the governance and values of the business.
LTIS
LTIS awards are granted based on a percentage of base salary at  
the point of award. Shares are released at the end of a three-year 
performance period, depending on the achievement against the 
Company performance targets.
LTIS awards for UK-based Executives are delivered as nil cost 
options at the end of the performance period and the options are 
exercisable for seven years. LTIS awards for non UK-based 
Executives are structured as conditional share awards and the 
shares are released at the end of the performance period.
Notional dividend equivalents are calculated at the end of the 
performance period on any conditional LTIS awards or at the point  
of exercise for nil cost options. Dividend equivalents are paid as 
additional shares or as cash.
If none of the EP shares are due to vest, then the KPI shares will not 
vest unless the Committee confirms that this would not be reflective 
of the true underlying performance of the Group.
If overall performance is not deemed satisfactory, the award for any 
year may be reduced or forfeited, at the discretion of the Committee.

remuneration Policy continued
Policy table notes
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration 
payments and payments for loss of office, notwithstanding  
that they are not in line with the policy set out above, where  
the terms of the payment were agreed
 
before the policy came  
into effect, at a time when the relevant individual was not an 
Executive of the Company or, in the opinion of the Committee, 
the payment was not in consideration for the individual 
becoming an Executive of the Company. For these purposes 
payments include the Committee satisfying awards of variable 
remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms 
of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
Centrica Pension Plan (CPP)
The CPP is a funded, HMRC-registered, final salary, contributory 
occupational pension scheme. Members' contributions are 
payable at the rate of 6% of pensionable earnings. Contributions 
made by the Executives who are also members of the Centrica 
Unfunded Pension Scheme are payable at the rate of 6% of their 
total pensionable earnings above the scheme earnings cap. 
No discretionary practices are taken into account in calculating 
transfer values.
Centrica Unfunded Pension Scheme (CUPS)
All registered scheme benefits are subject to HMRC guidelines 
and the Lifetime Allowance. The CUPS defined benefit section 
provides any additional benefits in excess of the maximum 
amount that could be provided through the CPP on the 
members' uncapped pensionable earnings. Pensionable  
pay increases are limited to pay reviews up to a maximum  
of 2% per annum with effect from 1 March 2012 for members  
of the CPP and CUPS defined benefit section.
The CUPS defined contribution section provides benefits for 
individuals not eligible to join the CUPS defined benefit section  
and for whom registered scheme benefits are expected to exceed 
the Lifetime Allowance. The CUPS defined contribution section 
is offered as a direct alternative to a cash salary supplement.
The CUPS defined benefit section was closed to new members 
in October 2002. 
CUPS is unfunded but the benefits are secured by a charge 
over certain Centrica assets. An appropriate provision in 
respect of the accrued value of these benefits has been  
made in the Company's balance sheet.
Economic profit (EP)
EP is adjusted operating profit (after share of joint venture interest) 
less a tax charge based on the tax rate relevant to the different 
business segments and after deduction of a capital charge.  
The capital charge is calculated as capital employed multiplied  
by the Group's weighted average cost of capital.
Where appropriate, expenditure on assets (and related costs)  
that are not yet in use (pre-productive capital) is excluded from 
capital employed. 
Earnings per share (EPS)
EPS is the Company's fully diluted earnings per share adjusted  
for exceptional items and certain re-measurements.
Non-financial KPIs
The non-financial KPI dashboard is designed to reward sustained 
high performance over the entire three-year performance period. 
The equally weighted measures are:
 	 lost time injury frequency rate;
 	 significant process safety event;
 	 British Gas net promoter score (NPS);
 	 Direct Energy NPS; and
 	 employee engagement.
For each measure, three performance zones have been 
established, represented by the following indicators:
  High performance zone
  Median performance zone
  Low performance zone
Total shareholder return (TSR)
TSR is calculated as the annualised percentage increase in the  
Net Return Index of the Company above the Net Return Index  
of the FTSE 100 over the three-year performance period. The 
Net Return Index reflects movements in the share price and 
dividends reinvested over the performance period. In the opinion 
of the Directors, the FTSE 100 Index is the most appropriate index 
against which the TSR of Centrica plc should be measured, as  
it is an index of similar sized companies.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy set 
out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative 
purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without 
obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.

total remuneration by performance scenario
The charts below indicate the minimum, on-target and maximum remuneration that could be received by each Executive, excluding  
share price movement and dividends. Assumptions made for each scenario are:
 	 minimum - fixed remuneration only (base salary, pension and benefits as disclosed in the single figure for total remuneration table  
on page 76);
 	 on-target - fixed remuneration plus target AIS (as set out in the Remuneration Policy table) assuming maximum deferral and expected value 
under the long-term incentive plans (DMSS matching award based on vesting of 60% and LTIS award based on vesting of 56.5%); and
 	 maximum - fixed remuneration plus maximum AIS opportunity (as set out in the Remuneration Policy table) assuming maximum deferral 
and maximum levels of vesting under DMSS and LTIS.
Discretion and judgement
It is crucial that the Committee maintains the flexibility to apply 
discretion and judgement to achieve fair outcomes as no 
remuneration policy and framework, however carefully designed and 
implemented, can pre-empt every possible scenario. The Committee 
needs to be able to exercise appropriate discretion to determine 
whether mechanistic or formulaic outcomes are fair, in context and 
can be applied in an upward or downward manner when required. 
Judgement is applied appropriately by the Committee, for example 
when considering the political and social pressures on the business, 
in setting Company and individual performance targets to ensure 
they are considered sufficiently stretching and that the maximum 
and minimum levels are appropriate.
The Committee has absolute discretion to decide who receives 
awards, the level of the awards under the long-term incentive plans 
and the timing, within the parameters set in the rules. 
In the case of a corporate action, the Committee can agree when a 
corporate action applies to a share award, whether awards pay out 
or are rolled over in this situation and how any special dividend might 
apply. The Committee also maintains the discretion to adjust any 
awards in the event of a variation of capital, for example to maintain 
the incentive value at the level originally intended.
The Committee retains discretion, consistent with market practice,  
regarding the operation and administration of the long-term incentive 
plans including, but not limited to, the following in relation to the LTIS 
and the DMSS:
 	 determination of the result of any disputes relating to the 
interpretation of the rules;
 	 alteration of the terms of the performance targets if it feels that  
they are no longer a fair measure of the Company's performance, 
as long as the new targets are not materially less challenging than 
the original ones;
 	 determination that any award is forfeit in whole or in part; and
 	 setting the level of the mandatory deferral of the DMSS, which 
must be at least 20% of annual bonus and deciding the maximum 
level of voluntary investment up to the limits set out in the rules.
The Committee also retains the discretion to forfeit deferred, 
investment or matching awards under the DMSS if it determines  
that prior performance which resulted in the annual bonus being 
awarded was discovered to be a misrepresentation of results or 
inappropriate management behaviour which fails to reflect the 
governance or values of the business.

r ecruitment policy
The Committee will apply the same remuneration policy during  
the policy period as that which applies to existing Executives when 
considering the recruitment of a new Executive in respect of all elements 
of remuneration as set out in the Remuneration Policy table. 
Whilst the maximum level of remuneration which may be granted 
would be within plan rules and ordinarily subject to the maximum 
opportunity set out in the Remuneration Policy table, in certain 
circumstances, an arrangement may be established specifically to 
facilitate recruitment of a particular individual up to 25% above the 
maximum opportunity, albeit that any such arrangement would  
be made within the context of minimising the cost to the Company.  
The policy for the recruitment of Executives during the policy period 
includes the opportunity to provide a level of compensation for 
forfeiture of bonus entitlements and/or unvested long-term incentive 
awards from an existing employer, if any, and the additional provision 
of benefits in kind, pensions and other allowances, as may be  
required in order to achieve a successful recruitment. 
The policy on the recruitment of new Non-Executive Directors 
(Non-Executives) during the policy period would be to apply the 
same remuneration elements as for the existing Non-Executives.  
It is not intended that variable pay, day rates or benefits in kind be 
offered, although in exceptional circumstances such remuneration 
may be required in currently unforeseen circumstances. The 
Committee will include in future Remuneration Reports details  
of the implementation of the policy as utilised during the policy 
period in respect of any such recruitment to the Board.
termination policy
The Committee carefully considers compensation commitments in 
the event of an Executive's termination. The aim is to avoid rewarding 
poor performance and to reduce compensation to reflect the 
departing Executive's obligations and to mitigate losses.
Save for summary dismissal, the policy is to either continue to 
provide base pay, pension and other benefits for any unworked 
period of notice or, at the option of the Company, to make a 
payment in lieu of notice comprising base pay only. Typically any 
payment in lieu of notice will be made in monthly instalments and 
reduce, or cease completely, in the event that remuneration from 
new employment is received. An AIS award for the year in which  
the termination occurs may be made following the normal year  
end assessment process, subject to achievement of the agreed 
performance measures and time apportioned for the period worked. 
Any award would be payable at that time without deferral and no 
new long-term incentive plan awards would be made. 
Except in cases of death in service, the policy is not to vest  
any existing long-term incentive plan awards earlier than their  
normal vesting date. In all cases any vesting remains subject  
to satisfaction of the associated performance conditions and 
will be time-apportioned for the period worked. 
Executives leaving following resignation will forfeit any potential  
AIS award for the performance year in which the resignation occurs 
and all unvested long-term incentive plan awards. In addition, 
Executives summarily dismissed will also forfeit any voluntary 
investment shares. Deferred awards can also be clawed back if  
it is subsequently discovered that the results have been achieved  
by behaviour which fails to reflect the governance and values of  
the business.
On a change of control, existing long-term incentive plan awards  
will be exchanged on similar terms or vest to the extent that the 
performance conditions have been met at the vesting date and  
be time-apportioned to the vesting date, subject to the overriding 
discretion of the Committee.
Pay and employment conditions across the Group
The Group operates in a number of different environments and  
has many employees who carry out diverse roles across a number 
of countries. All employees, including Executives, are paid by reference 
to the market rate and base pay is reviewed annually. The ratio 
between fixed and variable pay for employees differs by level, 
geographic location and business unit.
A number of performance-related incentive schemes and all-employee 
share plans are operated across the Group which differ in terms of 
structure and metrics from those applying to Executives.
Performance measures applying to Executives are cascaded  
down through the organisation and Group employment conditions 
include high standards of health and safety and employee 
wellbeing initiatives.
No consultation in respect of Executive remuneration took place  
with employees during the year.
Shareholding guidelines
Minimum shareholding guidelines are in place for Executive Directors 
and senior executives to build and maintain a value of shares over  
a five year period from date of appointment as follows:
 	 Chief Executive - 2 times base salary;
 	 other Executive Directors - 1.25 times base salary; and
 	 senior executives - 1 times base salary.
In addition to the guidelines above and to align with investor 
preference, for awards made after 1 January 2011, the guidelines 
provide that all transferred shares under the Group's long-term 
incentive arrangements be retained for a minimum period of five 
years from the original award or grant date.
External appointments of Executive Directors
It is the Company's policy to allow each Executive to accept one 
non-executive directorship of another company, although the  
Board retains the discretion to vary this policy.
Fees received in respect of external appointments are retained  
by the individual Executive.
implementation in the next financial period
Base salary increases for Executives in 2014 will be in line with the 
increases awarded to the general UK employee population during 
the year.
AIS awards will be made to the Executives in line with the limits set 
out in the Remuneration Policy. Sixty per cent of the award will be 
linked to financial performance and 40% will be subject to the 
achievement of individual strategic objectives aligned to the Group's 
strategic priorities. Performance measures will be disclosed 
retrospectively due to their commercial sensitivity.
Awards will be made to the Executives under the LTIS and the 
DMSS, in line with the limits set out in the Remuneration Policy. 
Performance measures and weightings are unchanged from  
the prior year.

SEr VicE coN tract S
The Executive Directors' service contracts expire on their 65th birthday. Service contracts provide that either the Executive or the Company 
may terminate the employment by giving one year's written notice and that the Company may pay base pay only in lieu of notice.
All Executive and Non-Executive Directors are required to be re-elected at each AGM.
The Committee retains a level of flexibility, as permitted by the Code, in order to attract and retain suitable candidates. It reserves the right 
to offer contracts which contain an initial notice period in excess of one year, provided that at the end of the first such period the notice 
period reduces to one year.

(i)  Phil Bentley resigned as an Executive Director on 30 June 2013 and remained an employee of Centrica until 31 December 2013. During the period between 31 July and 31 December 2013,  
he received basic salary and benefits. The figures in this table include his emoluments for the period to 30 June 2013. The bonus was calculated in accordance with Group EP and  
British Gas EP performance and strategic priorities.
(ii)  Rick Haythornthwaite was appointed as a Non-Executive Director on 14 October 2013 and as Chairman on 1 January 2014.
(iii) Mike Linn was appointed as a Non-Executive Director on 1 June 2013.
(iv)  Andrew Mackenzie resigned as a Non-Executive Director on 10 May 2013.
(v)  Each Executive apart from Phil Bentley, Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff has deferred part of their AIS award on a gross basis and invested these funds into DMSS in accordance with  
the rules for minimum mandatory and voluntary maximum deferral. 
(vi)  Benefits include car and fuel, health and medical, financial planning advice, matching shares received under the Share Incentive Plan and the gain from any options exercised under the 
HMRC-approved Sharesave plan. Benefits for Chris Weston include expenses and benefits paid under the terms of his international assignment agreement including for his relocation  
from the US to the UK.
(vii)  The long-term incentives include a forecast of the value of the LTIS and DMSS matching awards due to vest in April 2014, relating to the three-year performance period ending in 2013.  
The LTIS awards were valued using the latest TSR projection as at 1 February 2014, which was 0% and the projected EPS performance outcome of 0%. The DMSS awards were valued  
using the projected EP performance outcome of 0%.
(viii)  The value of the increase in defined benefit pension accrual for Phil Bentley and Chris Weston has been calculated using the BIS methodology of 20 times the increase in accrued pension  
for the year (less an allowance for the contributions paid by the member and CPI inflation of 5.2% in 2012 and 2.2% in 2013). Notional contributions to the CUPS DC Scheme for Sam Laidlaw,  
Mark Hanafin and Nick Luff have been included in this table as if CUPS DC were a cash balance scheme.
(ix)  The 2012 total remuneration figures have been recalculated and restated to comply with the new regulations. The share price on the date of release of the LTIS and DMSS matching conditional 
awards was 369.28p and the share price at the point of vesting of the LTIS and DMSS matching nil cost options was 372.04p (the 3 month average share price used to calculate the awards  
in the 2012 remuneration report was 328.6p). The value of dividend equivalents accrued up until the date of vesting have been calculated for the LTIS and DMSS matching nil cost options and  
the value of the pension salary sacrifice waiver into the CUPS DC plan has been added.
(x)  As indicated on page 65 Sam Laidlaw has elected to donate his entire 2013 bonus to charity.

Base pay/salary
There were no increases to the base salary of Sam Laidlaw and  
Nick Luff in 2013, thus maintaining the levels originally set in 2010. 
Salaries for Mark Hanafin, Managing Director International Upstream 
and Chris Weston, Managing Director International Downstream 
were set at the time of their appointment into those roles in 
July 2013. 
Base salaries will be reviewed during the course of 2014.

Pension 
Chris Weston and Phil Bentley participate in the Centrica Pension 
Plan (CPP), a contributory final salary arrangement and in the 
Centrica Unfunded Pension Scheme (CUPS) defined benefit (DB) 
section. Full disclosure of the pension arrangements for Phil Bentley 
and Chris Weston is given below.
Sam Laidlaw, Mark Hanafin and Nick Luff are entitled to receive  
a salary supplement of 40% of base pay or participate in the CUPS 
defined contribution (DC) section. During the year, the three Executives 
participated in the CUPS DC section and received an unfunded 
promise equal to 40% of base pay. Notional contributions to the 
CUPS DC Scheme have been included in the single figure for total 
remuneration table on page 76 as if it was a cash balance scheme.

Earnings per share (EPS)
EPS growth during the three-year period ending with 2012 did not 
exceed RPI growth by 9%. Consequently, the EPS portion of the 
2010 LTIS award did not vest.

termination arrangements for Phil Bentley
As announced on 27 February 2013, Phil Bentley stepped down 
from his role as Managing Director of British Gas and, therefore,  
as an Executive Director on 30 June 2013 and he left the Company 
on 31 December 2013. 
Phil Bentley was paid according to his contractual arrangements 
including a pro-rata performance bonus award through to the expiry 
of his accrued vacation on 31 July 2013. Thereafter he was paid  
a basic salary and all bonus earning opportunities ceased. He did  
not participate in any new long-term awards granted in 2013. 
On completion of his employment, he was deemed to have worked 
his contractual notice period and no lump sum was paid in lieu of 
notice. His remuneration for the period up to 30 June 2013 is 
included in the single figure for total remuneration table on page 76.
In accordance with the termination policy on page 74, Phil Bentley  
is entitled to all accrued allocations that had been earned during his 
employment under the long-term incentive plans in the normal way. 
The value of the long-term incentive plans will be time apportioned 
and will remain subject to the performance conditions and, therefore, 
the number of shares which will vest will be lower than the maximum 
potential. The actual value of the awards will be determined at the 
end of each performance measurement period.
Phil Bentley left with a pension entitlement consistent with his 
contractual rights which reflects his length of service and includes 
accrued rights transferred in from his prior employment commencing 
in September 1980. Under the pension arrangements he is entitled 
to retire at age 55 on a reduced pension or at age 58 on an 
unreduced pension.

Percentage change in cEo remuneration compared with  
other employees
The table below shows the percentage change in base pay/salary, 
taxable benefits and AIS payments between 2012 and 2013 for  
Sam Laidlaw, compared with a comparator group of UK employees, 
over the same period of time.

The comparator group includes management employees based in  
the UK in Level 2 to Level 5 (where Level 1 is the CEO). The employees 
selected have been employed in their role throughout 2012 and 2013 
to give a meaningful comparison. The group has been chosen as the 
employees have a remuneration package with a similar structure  
to the CEO, including base salary, benefits and annual bonus.
The increase in Sam Laidlaw's taxable benefits is not as a result of  
his entitlement increasing but is due to a change in the Company 
provided vehicle.

The membership of the Remuneration Committee during 2013  
is set out in the Governance Report on page 61.
Sam Laidlaw, Grant Dawson (General Counsel & Company Secretary), 
Jill Shedden (Group Director, Human Resources) and David House 
(Group Reward and HR Operations Director) are normally invited to 
attend each Committee meeting and provide advice and guidance 
to the Committee, other than in respect of their own remuneration. 
No additional fees are paid for this advice and guidance in addition 
to the salaries of these employees under their service contracts.
The Committee also has access to detailed external information  
and research on market data and trends from independent 
consultants. Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) was appointed by the Committee 
in 2011 as independent external adviser and provided support to  
the Committee on executive remuneration design, benchmarking 
and market data during 2013. The fees amounted to  15,000.
Deloitte has also provided advice to Centrica globally during 
2013 in the areas of employment taxes, share schemes, pensions, 
corporate finance, management consulting and internal audit.
The Committee is satisfied with the performance of Deloitte and  
has determined that it is not necessary to seek a tender for the 
services currently provided. 
Alithos was appointed by the Company in 2002 to provide a TSR 
monitoring and reporting service. The fees for TSR reports provided 
to the Committee on completion of the LTIS performance cycles 
during 2013 and the TSR performance graphs provided for inclusion 
in the Remuneration Report, amounted to  6,000. Alithos also 
provided monthly TSR reports and updates to the Company  
which were used to keep the general LTIS population regularly 
updated with TSR performance. The fees for this service  
amounted to  27,000.
The Committee takes into account the Remuneration Consultants 
Group's Code of Conduct when dealing with its advisers. The 
Committee is satisfied that the advice it received during the year  
was objective and independent and that the provision of those  
other services by Deloitte and Alithos in no way compromises  
their independence.
