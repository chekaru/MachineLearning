CERES POWER HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008
Remuneration Report
The Board of Directors is pleased to present the Company's 
first Remuneration Report. As the Company's shares are listed 
on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London 
Stock Exchange, the Company is not required to report in 
accordance with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985, 
Schedule B of the Combined Code and the Directors' Report 
Regulations 2002. This report, while not complying fully with 
these requirements, has been presented to disclose the  
key aspects of Directors' remuneration and the Board  
hopes that this report will provide shareholders with a  
greater understanding of the rationale behind the current 
remuneration arrangements for senior management and  
the link between Group strategy and future potential rewards 
for executives.
All sections of the Remuneration Report, other than those 
specifically marked as audited, are unaudited.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the  Committee') consists 
exclusively of Non-Executive Directors and presently 
comprises Brian Count and Alan Wood and is chaired by 
Sir David Brown. The Committee met nine times during the 
year. Dr Peter Bance attended all meetings in order to assist 
on matters concerning remuneration of other senior 
executives within the Group; however he was not present 
during the part of the meetings where his own remuneration 
was discussed. 
Since the year end the Committee has received 
independent executive remuneration advice, principally  
in relation to the design of incentive arrangements, from 
remuneration consultants Hewitt New Bridge Street (HNBS). 
Neither HNBS nor any other part of Hewitt Associates provided 
any other services to the Group during the year. 
Role of the Committee
The Committee is responsible for determining, on behalf  
of the Board, an appropriate remuneration policy for the 
Executive Directors and for designing a remuneration 
framework for them that is consistent with that policy. The 
Committee also monitors remuneration practice amongst 
other senior executives, recommends the Chairman's fee 
level and oversees the compensation philosophy of Ceres 
Power generally.
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors
The Committee's policy is that Executive Directors' 
remuneration packages should:
provide the Directors with the opportunity to receive  
a share in the future growth and development of the 
Group that is regarded as fair by other employees and  
by shareholders;
provide appropriate alignment between the Group's 
strategic goals for which the Directors have collective 
responsibility, shareholder returns and executive reward;
be, as far as possible, simple to understand and administer;
be determined taking into account external market 
benchmarks so that the total value of remuneration 
packages (calculated on a  target' basis) should be 
broadly competitive with mid-market practice compared to 
listed companies of a similar size within similar sectors. This 
should allow the Group to attract and retain key individuals 
critical to the future success of the business;

be appropriate given pay levels within the Group  
more generally; and
be structured so as to comply with key corporate 
governance best practice guidelines.
Remuneration structure for Executive Directors
Overview
Before the Group reaches the volume production phase,  
the Committee believes that the remuneration structure  
for Executive Directors should be weighted more towards 
performance-related pay than would be the market norm  
for an  established' company with, for example, circa 60%  
of the Chief Executive Officer's  target' remuneration 
package being determined by the Group's performance.
To achieve this, the Committee proposes a structure which 
would see Directors receive below market levels of fixed pay 
(salary and benefits) in return for above market levels of 
performance-related pay potential. Accordingly, if the Group 
performs poorly then the Directors will receive significantly 
below market levels of total remuneration whereas if the 
Group performs strongly then the Directors will benefit along 
with shareholders.
Base salary
As noted above, the Committee currently aims to set salary 
levels at below market levels. The agreed salaries for 2008/09 
are: Dr Peter Bance  196,833; Rex Vevers  162,225; Dr Andrew 
Baker  162,225. 
Benefits
Executive Directors receive a pension contribution from  
the Group worth 8% of salary (with Executive Directors 
contributing 3% of salary) and life assurance of four  
times salary. 
Performance-related pay
To date, performance-related pay for the Executive Directors 
has been discretionary and has consisted of annual cash 
bonuses and periodic grants of market value share options 
with associated performance conditions at the discretion of 
the Committee.
The Committee is aware that this existing arrangement does 
not provide executives with a particularly clear  line-of-sight' 
between performance and reward and is not consistent with 
corporate governance best practice due to the absence  
of measurable performance conditions on the share 
options. Accordingly, the Committee, assisted by HNBS, 
has developed new incentive arrangements that it is 
intended will apply from the 2008/09 financial year onwards. 
Details of these proposed new arrangements are outlined in 
the accompanying Notice of Meeting for the 2008 AGM.
Share ownership guideline
To be consistent with best practice, a formal share ownership 
guideline will be introduced for Executive Directors requiring 
them to retain at least half of any shares arising from the 
exercise of any future option grant (after selling sufficient 
shares to pay the exercise price and to fund any tax due  
on the options) until they have a holding of Group shares 
worth at least 100% of their base salary (200% of salary for  
the Chief Executive Officer).

Service contracts
Each Executive Director has a service contract with the Group which contains details regarding remuneration, restrictions and 
disciplinary matters. Executive Directors are appointed on contracts terminable by the Group or the Director on not more than 
12 months' notice. 
Non-Executive Directors
The Board aims to recruit and retain Non-Executive Directors of a high calibre with the requisite experience required to achieve
