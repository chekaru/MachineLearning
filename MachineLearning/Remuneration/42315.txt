Remuneration Report
The Board of Directors presents the Company's 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 June 2009.  
As the Company's shares are listed on the Alternative 
Investment Market ( AIM') of the London Stock Exchange, 
the Company is not required to report in accordance  
with the remuneration disclosure requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and relevant regulations. This  
report, while not complying fully with these requirements, 
has been presented to disclose the key aspects of 
Directors' remuneration and the Board hopes that  
this report will provide shareholders with a better 
understanding of the rationale behind the current 
remuneration arrangements for senior management  
and the link between the performance of the Company 
and the rewards for executives.
All sections of the Remuneration Report, other than those 
specifically marked as audited, are unaudited.
Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee
Throughout the year the Remuneration Committee 
comprised the Non-Executive Directors and was chaired 
by Sir David Brown. The Committee met 9 times during the 
year. Dr Peter Bance is invited to attend meetings to assist 
the Committee on matters concerning remuneration of 
other senior executives within the Group, however he was 
not present during the part of the meetings where his own 
remuneration was discussed.
The Committee is responsible for determining, on behalf  
of the Board, an appropriate remuneration policy for the 
Executive Directors and for designing a remuneration 
framework for them that is consistent with that policy. The 
Committee also monitors remuneration practice amongst 
other senior executives, determines the Chairman's fee 
level and oversees the compensation philosophy of Ceres 
Power generally. The Board, excluding the Non-Executive 
Directors, determines the remuneration levels of the 
Non-Executive Directors.
At its meetings during the year, the Committee completed 
an extensive programme of work, considering amongst 
other matters the following:
the 2008 Remuneration Report; >
design and implementation of the Company's medium- >
term incentive arrangements that were approved by 
shareholders at the Company's Annual General 
Meeting on 5 December 2008;
the level of achievement of the Alpha Phase of the CHP  >
Project Bonus Plan; 
setting performance targets in respect of the Beta  >
Phase of the CHP Project Bonus Plan;
design and implementation of a new company-wide  >
Sharesave scheme;
levels of base salary for executives; >
terms of employment for all senior executives; >
proposed terms of appointment of senior executives;  >
and 
review of rewards and benefits available to all  >
employees in the Group.
During the year the Committee has been advised on the 
above matters by independent remuneration consultants 
Hewitt New Bridge Street ( HNBS') whose services were 
approved by the Remuneration Committee. Neither HNBS 
nor any other part of Hewitt Associates provided any other 
services to the Group during the year.
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors
The Committee's policy is that Executive Directors' 
remuneration packages should:
provide the Directors with the opportunity to receive   >
a share in the future growth and value of the Group  
that is regarded as fair by other employees and  
by shareholders;
provide appropriate alignment between the Group's  >
strategic and operational goals for which the Directors 
have collective responsibility, shareholder returns and 
executive reward;
be, as far as possible, simple to understand and  >
administer;
be determined taking into account external market  >
benchmarks so that the total value of remuneration 
packages (calculated on a  target' basis) should be 
broadly competitive with mid-market practice 
compared to listed companies of a similar size within 
similar sectors. This should allow the Group to attract 
and retain key individuals critical to the future success 
of the business;
include below market levels of fixed pay (salary and  >
benefits) in return for above market levels of 
performance-related pay potential;
be appropriate given pay levels within the Group more  >
generally; and
be structured so as to comply with key corporate  >
governance best practice guidelines.
Remuneration structure for Executive Directors
Overview
As noted in last year's Remuneration Report, the 
Committee believes that at this stage of the  
Group's development the remuneration structure for 
Executive Directors should be weighted more towards 
performance-related pay than would be the market 
 norm' for an  established' company. 
Base salary
Executive Directors' base salaries are reviewed annually. In 
respect of 2009 the Committee has decided that no base 
salary increases will be awarded to Executive Directors. 
The agreed salaries for 2009/10 are: Dr Peter Bance 
 196,833 (2008/09:  196,833) and Rex Vevers  162,225 
(2008/09:  162,225).
Benefits
In line with all other employees, Executive Directors receive 
a pension contribution worth 8% of salary (with Executive 
Directors contributing at least 3% of salary) and employer's 
National Insurance saved on employee pension 
contributions from the Group and life assurance of four 
times salary. 20

Sharesave scheme
During the year the Committee implemented an HMRC-approved Sharesave scheme. The Executive Directors are eligible 
to participate in this scheme, which is open to all eligible employees on the same basis, providing a long-term savings 
and investment opportunity.
Performance-related pay
During the year the Committee, assisted by HNBS, consulted extensively with shareholders and institutions and 
formulated new incentive arrangements that will apply until the end of June 2011. Rather than the traditional listed 
company combination of: i). an annual bonus (where performance is measured over one year); and ii). annual grants of 
long-term share awards (where performance is typically measured over three years), the Committee has implemented 
two medium-term incentive arrangements that will operate until the financial year ending in June 2011. These medium-
term incentive arrangements are designed to more closely match the Company's strategy.
These incentive arrangements, which were approved by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 5 
December 2008, provide executives with a clear  line-of-sight' between performance and reward with measurable 
performance conditions directly linked to the successful delivery of the Company's key strategic and operational goals 
and growth of the Company. The arrangements reward executives through a mixture of cash, deferred shares and share 
options and achieve an appropriate balance between incentive, reward and retention.
Details of the two medium-term incentive arrangements are outlined below:
One-off grant of share options
On 11 December 2008, the Executive Directors and other senior executives were granted a one-off award of share 
options under the Company's existing 2004 Employees' Share Option Scheme. It is intended that, other than in 
settlement of the deferred element of the CHP Project Bonus Plan (see below), no further share options will be granted  
to existing Executive Directors and senior executives either under this scheme or under any similar scheme until after 
June 2011. 
The terms of this grant were as outlined to shareholders in last year's Notice of Annual General Meeting other than that 
the share options were granted with an exercise price of  2 per share, being the higher of the average market price over 
the 20 trading days ending on 9 December 2008 (being  0.92) and  2. This  out of the money' exercise price, a more 
challenging requirement than was stated in the Notice of Annual General Meeting, was considered appropriate by the 
Committee in order to create an additional hurdle for executives. Exercise of the options is subject to the prior 
achievement of absolute share price targets and normally is dependent on continued employment until the initial 
exercise point. The Committee felt that this provided the clearest alignment between the interests of shareholders and 
executives given the absence of any obvious comparator group of companies against which a Total Shareholder Return 
measure could be constructed. 
The options granted to the Executive Directors and other senior executives can only be exercised if the following share 
price targets are achieved over 20 consecutive trading days at some point during the exercise period:
     Percentage   Exercise 
     of options  Share price period 
     exercisable target (post grant)
Tranche 1     25%  4 2-10 years
Tranche 2     37.5%  5 3-10 years
Tranche 3     37.5%  6 4-10 years
The Chief Executive Officer, Dr Peter Bance, was awarded 850,000 one-off share options and the Finance Director, Rex 
Vevers, was awarded 637,500 options. Other senior executives were awarded one-off share options of no more than 75% 
of the Chief Executive Officer's award. 21

CHP Project Bonus Plan
The CHP Project Bonus Plan replaces the previous bonus arrangements and will operate for a further two years ending in 
June 2011. 
Under this plan, Executive Directors and selected other senior executives and staff are eligible to receive a bonus at the 
completion of each of the Alpha, Beta and Gamma phases of the CHP Project. The maximum potential bonus payment 
at the end of each phase is 100% of annual salary for Dr Peter Bance and for all other eligible participants no more than 
75% of their salary. All awards for the successful completion of each phase made under this plan are payable in two 
instalments; 50% of any award is payable immediately in cash and the remaining 50% as a deferred award in the  
form of nominal value share options which vest to the individual no earlier than 30 June 2012, subject normally to 
continued employment within the Group.
The amount of any award granted under this plan is subject to the Committee's assessment of the level and quality of 
delivery of each of the Alpha, Beta and Gamma phases of the CHP Project at the completion of each phase of the 
project (known as  milestone targets'). 
The Committee reviewed the delivery of all of the Alpha phase milestone targets and, taking into account the successful 
sign-off of the Alpha phase and the receipt of the  2 million payment from British Gas, determined that the bonus 
payments would be 75% of the available maximum.
The Committee has also agreed the Beta phase milestone targets for the coming year. These milestone targets are 
based on the delivery of key product, manufacturing, commercial and financial metrics and ensure that the CHP Project 
Bonus Plan continues to align the interests of executives and shareholders by rewarding successful delivery of key 
strategic and operational goals.
Share ownership guideline
To be consistent with best practice, the Committee has implemented a formal share ownership guideline for Executive 
Directors requiring them to retain at least half of any shares arising from the exercise of any options under the one-off 
award and any future option grant (after selling sufficient shares to pay the exercise price and to fund any tax due on the 
options) until they have a holding of Company shares worth at least 100% of their base salary (200% for the Chief 
Executive Officer).
Service contracts
Each Executive Director has a service contract with the Group which contains details regarding remuneration, restrictions 
and disciplinary matters. Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial period of three years. All Directors are 
appointed on contracts terminable by the Group on not more than 12 months notice. 22

Non-Executive Directors
The Board aims to recruit and retain Non-Executive Directors of a high calibre with the requisite experience required to 
achieve success for the Group and its shareholders. 
The fees of the Chairman are determined by the Committee and the fees of the Non-Executive Directors are determined by 
the Board following a recommendation from the Chairman after consulting with the Chief Executive. It should be noted that 
neither the Chairman nor the Non-Executive Directors take part in the determination of their own remuneration.
The annual fee levels as at 30 June 2009 are as follows:
        2009 
          
Chairman          100,000
Senior Non-Executive Director         45,000
Other Non-Executive Directors        40,000
 
Chairs of Board sub-committees, other than the Chairman, earn an additional  5,000 per annum per committee, and 
each of Sir David Brown, Alan Wood and John Nicholas chaired one committee during the year. 
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Group's incentive schemes.
