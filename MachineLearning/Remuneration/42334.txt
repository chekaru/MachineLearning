Remuneration Report
The Board of Directors presents the Company's Remuneration 
Report for the year ended 30 June 2010. As the Company's 
shares are registered on the Alternative Investment Market ( AIM') 
of the London Stock Exchange, the Company is not required to 
report in accordance with the remuneration disclosure 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and relevant regulations. 
This report, while not complying fully with these requirements, has 
been presented to disclose the key aspects of Directors' 
remuneration and the Board hopes that this report will provide 
shareholders with a better understanding of the rationale behind 
the current remuneration arrangements for senior management 
and the link between the performance of the Group and the 
rewards for executives.
All sections of the Remuneration Report, other than those 
specifically marked as audited, are unaudited.
Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is comprised of the Non-Executive 
Directors and is chaired by Sir David Brown. The Committee met 
four times during the year. Dr. Peter Bance is invited to attend 
meetings to assist the Committee on matters concerning 
remuneration of other senior executives within the Group, however 
he was not present during the part of the meetings where his own 
remuneration was discussed.
The Committee is responsible for determining, on behalf of the 
Board, an appropriate remuneration policy for the Executive 
Directors and for designing a remuneration framework for them 
that is consistent with that policy. The Committee also monitors 
remuneration practice amongst other senior executives, 
determines the Chairman's fee level and oversees the 
compensation philosophy of Ceres Power generally.
At its meetings during the year, the Committee considered, 
amongst other matters, the following:
the 2009 Remuneration Report;  	
the level of achievement of the Beta Phase of the CHP Project  	
Bonus Plan;
setting performance targets in respect of the 2010-2011 Phase  	
of the CHP Project Bonus Plan;
implementation of a second company-wide Sharesave scheme;  	
levels of base salary for executives;  	
terms of employment for all senior executives;  	
proposed terms of appointment of senior executives; and  	
review of rewards and benefits available to all employees   	
in the Group.
During the year the Committee has been advised by independent 
remuneration consultants Hewitt New Bridge Street ( HNBS'). 
Neither HNBS nor any other part of Hewitt Associates provided 
any other services to the Group during the year.
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors
The Committee's policy is that Executive Directors' remuneration 
packages should:
provide the Directors with the opportunity to receive a share in  	
the future growth and value of the Group that is regarded as fair 
by other employees and by shareholders;
provide appropriate alignment between the Group's strategic  	
and operational goals for which the Directors have collective 
responsibility, shareholder returns and executive reward;
be, as far as possible, simple to understand and administer;  	
be determined taking into account external market benchmarks  	
so that the total value of remuneration packages (calculated  
on a  target' basis) should be broadly competitive with mid-
market practice compared to listed companies of a similar  
size within similar sectors. This should allow the Group to 
attract and retain key individuals critical to the future success  
of the business;
include below market levels of fixed pay (salary and benefits)   	
in return for above market levels of performance-related  
pay potential;
be appropriate given pay levels within the Group more  	
generally; and
be structured so as to comply with key corporate governance  	
best practice guidelines.
Remuneration structure for Executive Directors
Overview
The Committee continues to believe that at this stage of the 
Group's development the remuneration structure for Executive 
Directors should be weighted more towards performance-related 
pay than would be the market  norm' for an  established' company.
Base salary
Executive Directors' base salaries are reviewed annually. The 
Committee has decided to award no base salary increase for Dr. 
Peter Bance and Rex Vevers for a second year in succession. The 
Committee has decided to award an increase of 4.7% to Dr. Phil 
Whalen to recognise the increase in his scope of responsibility 
since his appointment to the Board in January 2010. The agreed 
salaries for 2010/11 are: Dr. Peter Bance  196,833 (2009/10: 
 196,833), Rex Vevers  162,225 (2009/10:  162,225) and Dr. Phil 
Whalen  162,225.
Benefits
In line with all other employees, Executive Directors receive a 
pension contribution from the Group worth 8% of salary (with 
Executive Directors contributing at least 3% of salary) plus 
employer's National Insurance saved on employee pension 
contributions from the Group and life assurance of four  
times salary.
Sharesave scheme
During the year the Committee implemented a second HMRC-
approved Sharesave scheme. The Executive Directors are eligible 
to participate in this scheme, which is open to all eligible 
employees on the same basis, providing a long-term savings and 
investment opportunity.
Performance-related pay
As noted in last year's Remuneration Report, the Committee, 
assisted by HNBS, implemented two medium-term incentive 
arrangements that provide executives with a clear  line-of-sight' 
between performance and reward. The scheme rewards 
executives through a mixture of cash, deferred shares and share 
options and achieves an appropriate balance between incentive, 
reward and retention. Measurable and demanding performance 
conditions are directly linked to the successful delivery of the 
Group's key strategic and operational goals and growth  
of the Group. 21 Ceres Power Holdings plc Annual Report 2010
Details of the two medium-term incentive arrangements and any awards made thereunder are outlined below:
One-off grant of share options
On 11 December 2008, Dr. Peter Bance, Rex Vevers and other senior executives were granted a one-off award of share options under 
the Company's existing 2004 Employees' Share Option Scheme.
The share options were granted with an exercise price of  2 per share, being the higher of the average market price over the 20 trading 
days ending on 9 December 2008 (being  0.92) and  2. This  out of the money' exercise price was considered appropriate by the 
Committee in order to create an additional hurdle for executives. Exercise of the options is subject to the prior achievement of an absolute 
share price target and normally is dependent on continued employment until the initial exercise point. The Committee felt that this 
provided the clearest alignment between the interests of shareholders and executives given the absence of any obvious comparator 
group of companies against which a Total Shareholder Return measure could be constructed.
During the year, 212,500 new one-off share options were granted to Dr. Phil Whalen in September 2009 on his joining the Group. 
Dr. Peter Bance holds 850,000 one-off share options (2009/10: 850,000) and Rex Vevers holds 637,500 options (2009/10: 637,500). 
Other senior executives hold options of no more than 75% of the Chief Executive Officer's award.
The options granted to the Executive Directors and other senior executives can only be exercised if the following share price targets are 
achieved over 20 consecutive trading days at some point in the period between the second and 10th anniversaries of the grant:
     Percentage Share  Exercise 
     of options price  period 
     exercisable target  (post grant)
Tranche 1     25%  4  2-10 years
Tranche 2     37.5%  5  3-10 years
Tranche 3     37.5%  6  4-10 years
CHP Project Bonus
The CHP Project Bonus plan replaced all previous bonus arrangements and is the only bonus scheme for Executive Directors that 
operates for the period up to December 2011.
Under this plan, Executive Directors and selected other senior executives, senior managers and staff are eligible to receive a bonus at the 
completion of relevant phases of the CHP Project. The maximum potential bonus award at the end of each phase is 100% of annual 
salary for Dr. Peter Bance and for all other eligible participants no more than 75% of their salary. All awards for the successful completion 
of each phase made under this plan are payable in two instalments; 50% of any award is payable immediately in cash and the remaining 
50% as a deferred award in the form of nominal value share options which vest to the individual no earlier than 30 June 2012 subject 
normally to continued employment within the Group.
The amount of any award granted under this plan is subject to the Committee's assessment of the level and quality of delivery of each of 
the phases of the CHP Project at the completion of each phase of the project (known as  milestone targets').
The Committee has reviewed and verified the successful delivery of the majority of the Beta phase milestone targets including technology, 
manufacturing, commercial and financial metrics. However, as noted in the Chairman's Statement and Chief Executive's Review on pages 
2 to 9, in July 2010 the Company announced a delay in completing the Beta phase and as a consequence, a delay in the expected CHP 
product launch from H2 2011 to mid 2012. Accordingly, the Committee has determined that no bonus award should be made to the 
Executive Directors. Notwithstanding the delay in the overall CHP timeline, the Group has achieved a number of the key Beta phase 
milestone targets that underpin the progress towards completing the Beta phase. The Committee has therefore approved bonus awards 
ranging between 10% and 24% of salary to participating senior managers and staff and the Committee would like to express its thanks 
for the substantial contribution and effort that these employees have made during a challenging year. This bonus was approved in July 
2010, at which time the options were granted.
The Committee has also agreed the milestone targets for the 2010-2011 period. These milestone targets are based on the delivery of key 
product, manufacturing, commercial and financial metrics and ensure that the CHP Project Bonus plan continues to align the interests of 
executives and shareholders by rewarding successful delivery of key strategic and commercial goals.
Share ownership guideline
Executive Directors are required to retain at least half of any shares arising from the exercise of any options under the one-off award and 
any future option grant (after selling sufficient shares to pay the exercise price and to fund any tax due on the options) until they have a 
holding of Company shares worth at least 100% of their base salary (200% for the Chief Executive Officer). 22 Ceres Power Holdings plc Annual Report 2010
