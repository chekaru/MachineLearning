Remuneration Report
The Board of Directors presents the Company's Remuneration 
Report for the year ended 30 June 2011. As the Company's shares 
are registered on the Alternative Investment Market ( AIM') of the 
London Stock Exchange, the Company is not required to report in 
accordance with the remuneration disclosure requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and relevant regulations. This report, while 
not complying fully with these requirements, has been presented 
to disclose the key aspects of Directors' remuneration and the 
Board hopes that this report will provide shareholders with a better 
understanding of the rationale behind the current remuneration 
arrangements for senior management and the link between the 
performance of the Group and the rewards for executives.
All sections of the Remuneration Report, other than those 
specifically marked as audited, are unaudited.
Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Non-Executive 
Directors and is chaired by Sir David Brown, Senior Independent 
Director. The Committee met five times during the year. The Chief 
Executive Officer is invited to attend meetings to assist the 
Committee on matters concerning remuneration of other senior 
executives within the Group; however he is not present during the 
part of the meetings where his own remuneration is discussed.
The Committee is responsible for determining, on behalf of the 
Board, an appropriate remuneration policy for the Executive 
Directors and for designing a remuneration framework for them 
that is consistent with that policy. The Committee also monitors 
remuneration practice amongst other members of the senior 
management team, determines the Chairman's fee level and 
oversees the compensation philosophy of Ceres Power generally.
At its meetings during the year, the Committee considered, 
amongst other matters, the following:
 	 the 2010 Remuneration Report;
 	 the level of achievement of the final phase of the Combined 
Heat and Power ( CHP') Project Bonus Plan targets;
 	 the design of a new incentive scheme for the executive team 
members and other senior managers;
 	 setting performance targets in respect of the 2011/12  
Bonus Plan;
 	 implementation of a third Company-wide Sharesave scheme;
 	 levels of base salary for Executive Directors;
 	 terms of employment for all members of the senior 
management team;
 	 proposed terms of appointment of members of the senior 
management team;
 	 the annual review of rewards and benefits available to all 
employees in the Group; and
 	 the termination arrangements for the CEO, Dr Peter Bance, 
who resigned on 13 June 2011.
During the year the Committee has been advised by independent 
remuneration consultants Hewitt New Bridge Street ( HNBS'). 
Neither HNBS nor any other part of Aon Hewitt provided any other 
services to the Group during the year.
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors
The Committee's policy is that Executive Directors' remuneration 
packages should:
 	 provide the Directors with the opportunity to receive a share in 
the future growth and value of the Group that is regarded as fair 
by other employees and by shareholders;
 	 provide appropriate alignment between the Group's strategic 
and operational goals for which the Directors have collective 
responsibility, shareholder returns and executive reward;
 	 be, as far as possible, simple to understand and administer;
 	 be determined taking into account external market 
benchmarks, so that the total value of remuneration packages 
(calculated on a  target' basis) should be broadly competitive 
with mid-market practice compared to listed companies of a 
similar size within similar sectors. This should allow the Group 
to attract and retain key individuals critical to the future success 
of the business;
 	 include below market levels of fixed pay (salary and benefits)  
in return for above market levels of performance-related  
pay whilst the Group continues its development towards 
commercialisation. The Committee envisages that a more 
standard pay structure, with market levels of fixed and 
performance-related pay, will be introduced once the Group 
has reached a commercial stage;
 	 be appropriate given pay levels within the Group more 
generally; and
 	 be structured so as to comply with key corporate governance 
best practice guidelines.
Remuneration structure for Executive Directors
Overview
The Committee continues to believe that at this stage of the 
Group's development the remuneration structure for Executive 
Directors should be weighted more towards performance-related 
pay than would be the market  norm' for an  established' company. 
The Committee envisages that a more standard pay structure, with 
market levels of fixed and performance-related pay, will be 
introduced once the Group has reached a commercial stage.
Base salary
Executive Directors' base salaries are reviewed annually although 
they have been frozen (other than for new appointments) since 
1 July 2008. The Committee decided to award an increase 
effective on 1 July 2011 of 5% to Rex Vevers and Dr Philip Whalen. 
The agreed salaries for 2011/12 are: Rex Vevers  170,350 (2010/11: 
 162,225) and Dr Philip Whalen  170,350 (2010/11:  162,225).
Dr Peter Bance, Chief Executive Officer, stepped down from  
the Board and left the Company on 13 June 2011. He received  
his contractual entitlement of one year's salary ( 196,833) on 
termination plus a further  88,550 compensation in respect of his 
UK statutory employment rights. The Remuneration Committee 
has treated Dr Bance as a  good leaver' under the Group's Option 
scheme rules. He therefore retains all of his share options, except 
those options where the exercise period commences more than 
twelve months after the date of resignation. 17 Ceres Power Holdings plc Annual Report 2011
David Pummell was appointed Chief Executive Officer on 17 August 2011 and took up the post on 5 September 2011. Under the terms of 
his service contract, he will receive a base salary of  250,000 per annum, terminable by the Group on not more than twelve months' 
notice, and he will be eligible to participate in the Group's 2011/12 incentive plans.
Benefits
In line with all other employees, Executive Directors receive a pension contribution from the Group worth 8% of salary (with Executive 
Directors contributing at least 3% of salary) plus employer's National Insurance saved on employee pension contributions from the Group. 
They also receive life assurance of four times salary.
Sharesave scheme
During the year the Committee implemented a third HMRC-approved Sharesave scheme. The Executive Directors are eligible  
to participate in this Scheme, which is open to all eligible employees on the same basis, providing a long-term savings and  
investment opportunity.
Performance-related pay
2010/11 Incentive arrangements
Details of the two incentive arrangements that operated in respect of 2010/11 and any awards made thereunder are outlined below:
One-off grant of share options
Dr Peter Bance, Rex Vevers and other senior executives were granted a one-off award of share options under the Company's existing 
2004 Employees' Share Option Scheme in 2008. Dr Phil Whalen was granted a one-off award of share options on joining the Company 
in 2009.
The share options were granted with an exercise price of  2 per share, being the higher of the average market price over the twenty 
trading days ending on 9 December 2008 (being  0.92) and  2. Exercise of the options is subject to the prior achievement of an absolute 
share price target and normally is dependent on continued employment until the initial exercise point. 
The options granted in 2008 and 2009 to the Executive Directors and other senior executives can only be exercised if the following share 
price targets are achieved over twenty consecutive trading days at some point in the period between the second and tenth anniversaries 
of the grant: 
Percentage 
of options 
exercisable
Share  
price  
target
Exercise  
period  
(post grant)
Tranche 1 25%  4 2-10 years
Tranche 2 37.5%  5 3-10 years
Tranche 3 37.5%  6 4-10 years
CHP Project Bonus Plan
The CHP Project Bonus Plan is the only bonus scheme for Executive Directors that operated during the year. 
Under this plan, Executive Directors and selected other senior executives and staff are eligible to receive a bonus at the completion of 
relevant phases of the CHP Project over the period 2008/09-2010/11. The maximum potential bonus award at the end of each phase is 
100% of annual salary for the Chief Executive Officer and for all other eligible participants no more than 75% of their base salary. All 
awards for the successful completion of each phase made under this plan are payable in two instalments; 50% of any award is payable 
immediately in cash and the remaining 50% as a deferred award in the form of nominal value share options which vest to the individual 
no earlier than 30 June 2012 subject normally to continued employment within the Group.
The amount of any award granted under this plan is subject to the Committee's assessment of the level and quality of delivery of each 
of the phases of the CHP Project at the completion of each phase of the project (known as  milestone targets'). 
The Committee has reviewed achievement of the 2010/11 milestone targets including technology, manufacturing, commercial and 
financial metrics and concluded that the Company has not met the key milestones. Accordingly, the Committee has determined that  
the Executive Directors should be awarded a zero bonus award for the period. Notwithstanding the failure to achieve the key milestones, 
the Group has achieved a number of important targets that underpin its progress. The Committee has therefore approved bonus awards 
up to 18% of salary to participating senior managers and staff and the Committee would like to express its thanks for the substantial 
contribution and effort that these employees have made during a challenging year. This bonus was approved in July 2011, at which time 
the options were granted. 18 Ceres Power Holdings plc Annual Report 2011

2011/12 Incentive arrangements
During the year the Committee, assisted by HNBS, has formulated new incentive arrangements that will operate for the 2011/12 
financial year. The Committee has decided to move towards the approach associated with a more traditional listed company. The new 
arrangements comprise a combination of: i) an annual bonus (where performance is measured over one year); and ii) annual grant of 
long-term share awards (where performance is typically measured over three years). The incentive arrangements provide executives with 
a clear  line-of-sight' between reward and performance. 
Details of the new incentive arrangements in place for the 2011/12 financial year are as follows:
Annual bonus
This scheme succeeds the CHP Project Bonus Plan and is the only bonus scheme for Executive Directors that will operate in 2011/12. 
Under the bonus scheme, Executive Directors and selected other senior executives and staff are eligible to receive a bonus payable 
wholly in cash based upon the successful achievement of key milestones that underpin the Company's progress towards the successful 
launch of a residential CHP product. The maximum potential annual bonus award is 100% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer, 
Finance Director and Technology Director and for all other eligible participants no more than 75% of their base salary. 
Share options
In respect of long-term share awards, the Committee concluded that:
 	 a policy of granting share options remained appropriate for 2011/12;
 	 options should have a market value exercise price;
 	 the adoption of an annual grant policy was appropriate (rather than another large one-off award as was granted in 2008/09  
and 2009/10);
 	 options should be subject to challenging absolute share price targets; and
 	 there should be no facility to retest the share price targets beyond the third anniversary of grant.
Accordingly, the Committee intends to grant Executive Directors and certain senior managers an award of share options following the 
publication of the Group's 2010/11 Annual Report, which is anticipated to be by the end of October 2011.
The share options will be granted at an exercise price to be determined based on the mid-market closing share price on the second  
trading day following the publication of the 2010/11 Annual Report on the Group's website. The options granted will vest on the third 
anniversary subject to the following share price targets having been achieved over twenty consecutive trading days within three years from 
the date of grant:
Share price Percentage of options vesting
Less than  1.50 Zero
 1.50 50%
At least  2.50 100%
Between  1.50 and  2.50 50% to 100% on a straight-line basis
The share options will lapse on the third anniversary of the date of grant unless the share price performance targets have been achieved. 
To the extent that the targets are satisfied, the options will be exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the grant.
Full details of the options awarded to Executive Directors will be published via the Regulatory News Service of the London Stock Exchange.
Share ownership guideline 
Executive Directors are required to retain at least half of any shares arising from the exercise of any options under the one-off award and 
any future option grant (after selling sufficient shares to pay the exercise price and to fund any tax due on the options) until they have a 
holding of Company shares worth at least 100% of their base salary (200% for the Chief Executive Officer). Compliance with this guideline 
is reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee. 
Service contracts 
Each Executive Director has a service contract with the Group which contains details regarding remuneration, restrictions and disciplinary 
matters. Executive Directors are appointed on contracts terminable by the Group on not more than twelve months' notice. 19 Ceres Power Holdings plc Annual Report 2011
Non-Executive Directors
The fees of the Chairman are determined by the Committee and the fees of the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board 
following a recommendation from the Chairman after consulting with the Chief Executive Officer. The Chairman and the Non-Executive 
Directors are not involved in any discussions or decisions about their own remuneration.
The annual fee levels as at 30 June 2011 (unchanged since 30 June 2009) are as follows:
2011 
 
Chairman 100,000
Senior Non-Executive Director 45,000
Other Non-Executive Directors 40,000

Alan Wood and John Nicholas chaired one Committee during the year. 
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Group's incentive schemes. 
Dr Brian Count received no additional fee for the period during which he served as Executive Chairman, between the resignation of 
Dr Peter Bance on 13 June 2011 and the date David Pummell took up his post on 5 September 2011.
