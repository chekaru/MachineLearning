 Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises three Non-Executive Directors - Nick Kuenssberg, Chairman, John Eccles
and John Bather. The Committee meets when necessary and is responsible for determining the remuneration policy
and packages of the Executive Directors.
Policy on remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Executives
The Committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages offered are designed to attract, maintain and motivate
high calibre Directors and senior executives. The remuneration policy attempts to match the interests of the
executives with those of shareholders by providing:-
(a) Basic salary and benefits
Executive Directors' basic salaries are reviewed each year, taking into account the performance of the
individual and rates of salary for similar jobs in companies of comparable size. The main benefits provided are
company cars and health insurance.
The Company operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes for the majority of its
employees, including Executive Directors. No performance related bonuses nor benefits in kind are included
in pensionable salary.
(b) Annual performance related bonus scheme
Barrie Williams and Peter Bell receive annual bonus payments dependent on improvement in earnings per
share and the end of year cash position. The maximum amount of bonus payable is 60% of their basic salary.
Adam Vicary receives annual bonus payments dependent on both annual profit targets and on the improvement
in earnings per share and the end of year cash position. The maximum amount payable is 60% of his basic salary. 
(c) Share options
An incentive to achieve longer-term improvements in shareholder value is afforded through share options. An
Approved Scheme and an Unapproved Scheme for Senior Executives were established in 1997. 
Option grants are exercisable only upon the achievement of performance targets to be determined by the
Committee when options are granted. Currently performance targets are that growth in the normalised
earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years of the company (commencing no earlier
than the financial year in which the option is granted) shall exceed the growth in the Retail Prices Index for
the same period by at least 6%.
Performance Graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance compared to the performance of the FTSE engineering and
machinery index over a five year period, measured by total shareholder return. This index has been selected as an
appropriate benchmark because it represents the market sector in which the Company operates.
Total shareholder return is calculated to show the theoretical growth in the value of a shareholding over a specified
period, assuming that dividends are re-invested to purchase additional shares.

Service contracts
Barrie Williams and Peter Bell have written service contracts dated 25 April 1996 containing provision for
termination on giving two years' notice, which in the opinion of the Board is consistent with the need for
Directors to take a long-term rather than a short-term view in their conduct and planning of the Company's affairs.
Adam Vicary has a one year rolling contract dated 28 June 1999.
Non-Executive Directors
Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is approved from time to time by the Board as a whole within the limits
set out in the Articles of Association. The Non-Executive Directors do not have formal contracts.
