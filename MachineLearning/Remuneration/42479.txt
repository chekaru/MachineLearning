Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the three non-executive directors; Tom Brown (Chairman), 
Nick Kuenssberg and Keith Jackson. The Committee meets when necessary, usually twice per year, and is
responsible for determining the remuneration packages of the executive directors and of the Chairman.
Policy on remuneration of executive directors and senior executives
The Committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages offered are designed to attract, retain and motivate
high calibre directors and senior executives, without paying more than necessary for the purpose. The remuneration
policy attempts to match the interests of the executives with those of shareholders by providing:-
(a) Basic salary and benefits
Executive directors' basic salaries are reviewed each year, taking into account the performance of the
individual and rates of salary for similar jobs in companies of comparable size. The main benefits provided are
company cars and health insurance.
The Company operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes for the majority of its
employees, including executive directors. No performance related bonuses nor benefits in kind are included
in pensionable salary.
(b) Annual performance related bonus scheme
In order to link executive remuneration to Group performance, executive directors participate in bonus
schemes appropriate to their objectives. Barrie Williams and Simon Duckworth receive annual bonus
payments dependent on improvement in group profit before tax, adjusted where considered necessary for
exceptional items and goodwill. The maximum amount of bonus payable is 50% of their basic salary.
Adam Vicary's annual bonus for the year to 31 March 2006 was dependent on the annual combined profits
of the foundry divisions. The maximum amount payable is 50% of his basic salary. 
(c) Share options
An incentive to achieve longer-term improvements in shareholder value is afforded through share options. An
Inland Revenue approved scheme and an unapproved scheme for senior executives were established in 1997. 
Options granted are exercisable only upon the achievement of performance targets to be determined by 
the Committee at the time that options are granted. Currently, performance targets are that growth in 
the underlying earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years of the Company
(commencing no earlier than the financial year in which the option is granted) shall exceed the growth in the
Retail Prices Index for the same period by at least 6%. The Remuneration Committee considered that this
performance condition was appropriate at the time the relevant options were granted, and that the use of
options aligns the rewards of directors with the long term interests of shareholders.
Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance compared to the performance of the FTSE engineering and
machinery index over a five year period, measured by total shareholder return. This index has been selected as an
appropriate benchmark because it represents the market sector in which the Company operates.
Total shareholder return is calculated to show the theoretical growth in the value of a shareholding over a specified
period, assuming that dividends are re-invested to purchase additional shares.

Service contracts
Barrie Williams has a written service contract dated 25 April 1996 containing provision for termination on giving 
2 years notice, or such shorter period beyond his 61st birthday as would coincide with his normal retirement date
of his 63rd birthday. His contract is therefore due to terminate on his normal retirement date of 20 September 2006. 
All new executive directors are expected to have rolling service contracts terminable on no more than 1 year's
notice. Simon Duckworth, who was appointed in November 2004, has such a rolling 1 year contract, as does Adam
Vicary, whose contract was updated and re-signed on 31 March 2005. Tim Hair has, initially, a fixed 12 month
contract. This is due to become a rolling 12 month contract on or before 1 September 2006.
Non-Executive Directors
Remuneration of the non-executive directors, apart from the Chairman, is approved from time to time by the
Chairman and the executive directors.
Tom Brown has entered into a letter of engagement with the Company, and Tom Brown & Company Limited has
entered into a service agreement with the Company both originally dated 12 September 2003 and updated on 
27 January 2005. The letter states that the term of his appointment by the Company will be three years from the
date of the letter unless terminated by either party giving to the other three months notice, or one year in the event
of a change in control of the Company. The other non-executive directors do not have formal contracts.

of death.
