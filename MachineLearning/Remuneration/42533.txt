Directors' Remuneration Report
Information not subject to audit
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the three non-executive Directors: Alan Howarth (Chairman), Tom Brown and Keith Jackson. The committee
meets when necessary, usually at least twice per year, and is responsible for determining the remuneration packages of the executive Directors and
of the Chairman.
Policy on remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Executives
The committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages offered are designed to attract, maintain and motivate high calibre Directors and senior
executives, without paying more than necessary for the purpose. The remuneration policy attempts to match the interests of the executives with
those of shareholders by providing:-
(a) Basic salary and benefits
Executive Directors' basic salaries are reviewed each year, taking into account the performance of the individual and rates of salary for similar jobs 
in companies of comparable size. The main benefits provided are company cars and health insurance.
The Company operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes for the majority of its employees, including executive Directors.
No performance related bonuses nor benefits in kind are included in pensionable salary.
(b) Annual performance related bonus scheme
In order to link executive remuneration to Group performance, executive Directors participate in bonus schemes appropriate to their objectives.
For the year ended 31 March 2009 the bonus in respect of Tim Hair and Mark Bache was linked to improvements in profitability of the Group.
The maximum amount of bonus payable is 50% of their basic salary.
Adam Vicary's annual bonus for the year to 31 March 2009 was dependent on the annual profit target of Chamberlin & Hill Castings Ltd. The 
maximum amount payable is 50% of his basic salary.
(c) Share options
An incentive to achieve longer-term improvements in shareholder value is afforded through share options. Two schemes have been in place since
1997 and two further schemes were established in 2007. The key features of the schemes are summarised as follows:
(i) Inland Revenue approved scheme and an unapproved scheme. Options granted under these schemes are exercisable only upon the
achievement of performance targets to be determined by the Committee at the time that options are granted. Currently, performance targets
are that growth in the normalised earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years of the company (commencing no earlier 
than the financial year in which the option is granted) shall exceed the growth in the Retail Prices Index for the same period by at least 6%.
The Remuneration Committee considered that this performance condition was appropriate at the time the relevant options were granted, and
that the use of options aligns the rewards of Directors with the long term interests of shareholders. The option price is based on the average
mid-market price for the 5 trading days prior to grant.
(ii) A Performance Share Plan which grants nil cost options under an Enterprise Management Scheme (EMI Options ). The EMI Options will normally
become exercisable in three equal tranches on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant subject to the satisfaction
of a performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee of the Company. The proportion of awards that become exercisable under
each tranche of the EMI Option varies on a straight line basis, from 25% to 100%, for average growth in underlying fully diluted EPS of between
5% p.a. and 10% p.a. above RPI over the period between grant and exercise dates. No options are exercisable if growth is below this range.
(iii) Non-EMI qualifying options are also granted under the Performance Share Plan. Non-EMI options become exercisable on the third anniversary of
the date of grant subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee of the Company. The proportion
of Non-EMI awards that become exercisable varies on a straight line basis from 25% to 100% based on the Company's TSR ranking against a
comparator group between the median and upper quartile ranking. No options are exercisable if growth is below this range.
(iv) A Share Option Plan (SOP ) which issues options at the average quoted market price of the Company's shares over the three months prior to
grant. The options will normally become exercisable in three equal tranches on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of 
grant subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee of the Company. The proportion of awards that
become exercisable under each tranche of the SOP varies on a straight line basis, from 25% to 100%, for average growth in Total Shareholder 
Return of between 15% p.a. and 25% p.a. over the period between grant and exercise dates, subject to achieving a minimum average growth
in underlying fully diluted EPS of 5% p.a. above RPI. No options are exercisable if growth is below this range.

Performance Graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance compared to the performance of the FTSE Engineering and Machinery index over a five year
period, measured by total shareholder return. This index has been selected as an appropriate benchmark because it represents the market sector in
which the Company operates.
Total shareholder return is calculated to show the theoretical growth in the value of a shareholding over a specified period, assuming that dividends are
re-invested to purchase additional shares.

Service contracts
All executive Directors who served during the year have rolling service contracts terminable on no more than 1 year's notice.
Non-executive directors
Remuneration of the non-executive Directors, apart from the Chairman, is approved each year by the Chairman and the executive Directors. The
Chairman's remuneration is approved by the Remuneration Committee.
Tom Brown has entered into a letter of engagement with the Company, and Tom Brown & Company Limited has entered into a service agreement with the
Company both originally dated 12 September 2003 and updated on 27 January 2005. The letter states that the term of his appointment by the Company
will be three years from the date of the letter unless terminated by either party giving to the other three months notice, or one year in the event of a
change in control of the Company. At the Board Meeting held on 24 April 2008 it was resolved to extend this for a further 3 year term. The other
non-executive Directors have comprehensive letters of appointment but do not have formal contracts.
