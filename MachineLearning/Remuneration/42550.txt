Directors' Remuneration Report 
Information not subject to audit
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the three non-executive Directors: Alan Howarth (Chairman), Tom Brown and Keith Jackson. The 
committee meets when necessary, usually at least twice per year, and is responsible for determining the remuneration packages of the 
executive Directors and of the Chairman.
Policy on remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Executives
The committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages offered are designed to attract, maintain and motivate high calibre Directors 
and senior executives, without paying more than necessary for the purpose. The remuneration policy attempts to match the interests of the 
executives with those of shareholders by providing:
(a) Basic salary and benefits
 Executive Directors' basic salaries are reviewed each year, taking into account the performance of the individual and rates of salary for 
similar jobs in companies of comparable size. The main benefits provided are company cars and health insurance.
 
 The Company operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes for the majority of its employees, including executive Directors. 
No performance related bonuses nor benefits in kind are included in pensionable salary.
(b) Annual performance related bonus scheme
 In order to link executive remuneration to Group performance, executive Directors participate in bonus schemes appropriate to their 
objectives. For the year ended 31 March 2010 the bonus in respect of Tim Hair and Mark Bache was linked to the profitability and  
cash flow performance of the Group and the achievement of personal objectives. The maximum amount of bonus payable is 100% of  
their basic salary. 
 Adam Vicary's annual bonus for the year to 31 March 2010 was dependent on the profit and cash flow of Chamberlin & Hill Castings Ltd. 
The maximum amount payable is 50% of his basic salary. 
(c) Share options
 An incentive to achieve longer-term improvements in shareholder value is afforded through share options. Two schemes have been in place 
since 1997 and two further schemes were established in 2007. Under the rules of one of the schemes set up in 2007, option awards were 
to have been made in three tranches over a three year period. As a mathematical consequence of the fall in the Group's share price since 
the onset of recession in late 2008, a disproportionately large number of options would have been awarded in the final tranche. In order 
to avoid this, and in consultation with the Group's Nomad and larger shareholders, no final award was made and all options previously 
awarded under this scheme and the 1997 schemes were surrendered. The rules and performance conditions were amended, taking 
account of shareholder feedback, and a single new award was made as set out in paragraph (iv) below. 
 The key features of the schemes in operation during the year are summarised as follows:
(i) Inland Revenue approved scheme and an unapproved scheme. Options granted under these schemes are exercisable only upon the 
achievement of performance targets to be determined by the Committee at the time that options are granted. Currently, performance 
targets are that growth in the normalised earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years of the Company 
(commencing no earlier than the financial year in which the option is granted) shall exceed the growth in the Retail Prices Index for the 
same period by at least 6%. The Remuneration Committee considered that this performance condition was appropriate at the time the 
relevant options were granted, and that the use of options aligns the rewards of Directors with the long-term interests of shareholders. 
The option price is based on the average mid-market price for the five trading days prior to grant. All options granted under this 
scheme were surrendered during the period as noted on page 20.
(ii) A Performance Share Plan which grants nil cost options under an Enterprise Management Scheme (EMI Options ). The EMI Options will 
normally become exercisable in three equal tranches on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant subject 
to the satisfaction of a performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee of the Company. The proportion of awards that 
become exercisable under each tranche of the EMI Option varies on a straight-line basis, from 25% to 100%, for average growth in 
underlying fully diluted EPS of between 5% p.a. and 10% p.a. above RPI over the period between grant and exercise dates. No options 
are exercisable if growth is below this range.

(iii) Non-EMI qualifying options are also granted under the Performance Share Plan. Non-EMI options become exercisable on the third 
anniversary of the date of grant subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee of the 
Company. The proportion of Non-EMI awards that become exercisable varies on a straight-line basis from 25% to 100% based on the 
Company's TSR ranking against a comparator group between the median and upper quartile ranking. No options are exercisable if 
growth is below this range.
(iv) A Share Option Plan (SOP ) which issues options at the average quoted market price of the Company's shares over a period of up 
to 90 trading days prior to grant. The options will normally become exercisable on or after the third anniversary of the date of grant 
subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee of the Company. The proportion of awards 
that become exercisable varies on a straight-line basis, from 25% to 100%, for average growth in Total Shareholder Return of between 
23.8% and 50.7% per annum over the period between the grant and vesting dates. This is equivalent to achieving a share price in the 
range of 100p to 180p. No options are exercisable if growth is below this range. 
 Certain options were granted under this scheme (as detailed on page 20) in parallel to the options outstanding under schemes (ii) and 
(iii) above. These parallel options are only tested against the above vesting conditions, and hence are potentially eligible to vest, in the 
event that the options that they are granted in parallel to fail to vest. 
Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance compared to the performance of the FTSE Engineering and Machinery index over a 
five year period, measured by total shareholder return. This index has been selected as an appropriate benchmark because it represents the 
market sector in which the Company operates.
Total shareholder return is calculated to show the theoretical growth in the value of a shareholding over a specified period, assuming that 
dividends are re-invested to purchase additional shares.

Service contracts
All executive Directors who served during the year have rolling service contracts terminable on no more than one year's notice.
Non-executive Directors
Remuneration of the non-executive Directors, apart from the Chairman, is approved each year by the Chairman and the executive Directors. 
The Chairman's remuneration is approved by the Remuneration Committee.
Tom Brown has entered into a letter of engagement with the Company, and Tom Brown & Company Limited has entered into a service 
agreement with the Company both originally dated 12 September 2003 and updated on 27 January 2005. The letter states that the term of 
his appointment by the Company will be three years from the date of the letter unless terminated by either party giving to the other three 
months notice, or one year in the event of a change in control of the Company. At the Board Meeting held on 24 April 2008 it was resolved  
to extend this for a further three year term. The other non-executive Directors have comprehensive letters of appointment but do not have 
formal contracts.

Options marked # are granted in parallel to options in existence at 31 March 2009 and not surrendered during the period, as noted above. 
These options are only tested against the vesting conditions as set out on page 18 (and thus potentially become eligible to vest), in the event 
that the options that they are granted in parallel to fail to vest. Only the original options or the parallel options can vest, not both.
