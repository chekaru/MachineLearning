Directors' Remuneration Report
Information not subject to audit
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the three non-executive Directors: Alan Howarth (Chairman), T om Brown and Keith Jackson. The committee meets 
when necessary, usually at least twice per year, and is responsible for determining the remuneration packages of the executive Directors and of the Chairman.
Policy on remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Executives
The committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages offered are designed to attract, maintain and motivate high calibre Directors and senior 
executives, without paying more than necessary for the purpose. The remuneration policy attempts to match the interests of the executives with those 
of shareholders by providing:
(a) Basic salary and benefits
 Executive Directors' basic salaries are reviewed each year, taking into account the performance of the individual and rates of salary for similar jobs in 
companies of comparable size. The main benefits provided are company cars and health insurance.
 The Company operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes for the majority of its employees, including executive Directors. No 
performance related bonuses nor benefits in kind are included in pensionable salary.
(b) Annual performance related bonus scheme
 In order to link executive remuneration to Group performance, executive Directors participate in bonus schemes appropriate to their objectives.  
For the year ended 31 March 2011 the bonus in respect of Tim Hair and Mark Bache was linked to the profit performance of the Group and the 
achievement of personal objectives. The maximum amount of bonus payable is 100% of their basic salary.
(c) Share options
 An incentive to achieve longer-term improvements in shareholder value is afforded through two share option schemes which were established in 
2007. The key features of the schemes are summarised as follows:
(i) A Performance Share Plan which grants nil cost options under an Enterprise Management Scheme (EMI Options ). The EMI Options will normally 
become exercisable in three equal tranches on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant subject to the satisfaction of a 
performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee of the Company. The proportion of awards that become exercisable under each tranche 
of the EMI Option varies on a straight line basis, from 25% to 100%, for average growth in underlying fully diluted EPS of between 5% p.a. and 10% 
p.a. above RPI over the period between grant and exercise dates. No options are exercisable if growth is below this range.
(ii) Non-EMI qualifying options are also granted under the Performance Share Plan. Non-EMI options become exercisable on the third anniversary of 
the date of grant subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee of the Company. The proportion of 
Non-EMI awards that become exercisable varies on a straight line basis from 25% to 100% based on the Company's TSR ranking against a 
comparator group between the median and upper quartile ranking. No options are exercisable if growth is below this range. These options expire 
on the 10
th
 anniversary of grant.
(iii) A Share Option Plan (SOP ) which issues options at the average quoted market price of the Company's shares over a period of up to 90 trading 
days prior to grant. The options will normally become exercisable on or after the third anniversary of the date of grant subject to the satisfaction 
of performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee of the Company. The proportion of awards that become exercisable varies on a 
straight line basis, from 25% to 100%, for average growth in Total Shareholder Return of between 23.8% and 50.7% per annum over the period 
between the grant and vesting dates. This is equivalent to achieving a share price in the range of 100p to 180p. No options are exercisable if 
growth is below this range.
 Certain options were granted under this scheme (as detailed on page 32) in parallel to the options outstanding under schemes (ii) and (iii) above. 
These parallel options are only tested against the above vesting conditions, and hence are potentially eligible to vest, in the event that the options 
that they are granted in parallel to fail to vest.
Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance compared to the performance of the FTSE Engineering and Machinery index over a five year 
period, measured by total shareholder return. This index has been selected as an appropriate benchmark because it represents the market sector in 
which the Company operates.
Total shareholder return is calculated to show the theoretical growth in the value of a shareholding over a specified period, assuming that dividends are 
reinvested to purchase additional shares. 31

Service contracts
All executive Directors who served during the year have rolling service contracts terminable on no more than 1 year's notice.
n on-executive Directors
Remuneration of the non-executive Directors, apart from the Chairman, is approved each year by the Chairman and the executive Directors. The 
Chairman's remuneration is approved by the Remuneration Committee.
Tom Brown has entered into a letter of engagement with the Company, and Tom Brown & Company Limited has entered into a service agreement with 
the Company both originally dated 12 September 2003 and updated on 27 January 2005. The letter states that the term of his appointment by the 
Company will be three years from the date of the letter unless terminated by either party giving to the other three months notice, or one year in the 
event of a change in control of the Company. At the Board Meeting held on 24 April 2008 it was resolved to extend this for a further 3 year term and at 
the Board Meeting held on 24 March 2011 it was resolved to extend this for up to a further 1 year. The other non-executive Directors have 
comprehensive letters of appointment but do not have formal contracts.
