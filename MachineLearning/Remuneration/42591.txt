Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the three non-executive Directors: Alan Howarth (Chairman), Keith Butler-Wheelhouse and Keith Jackson. The 
committee meets when necessary, usually at least twice per year, and is responsible for determining the remuneration packages of the executive Directors and 
of the Chairman.
Policy on remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Executives
The committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages o ered are designed to attract, maintain and motivate high calibre Directors and senior executives, 
without paying more than necessary for the purpose. The remuneration policy attempts to match the interests of the executives with those of shareholders 
by providing:
(a) Basic salary and benefits
Executive Directors' basic salaries are reviewed each year, taking into account the performance of the individual and rates of salary for similar jobs in 
companies of comparable size. The main benefits provided are company cars and health insurance.
The Company operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes for the majority of its employees, including executive Directors. No 
performance related bonuses nor benefits in kind are included in pensionable salary.
(b) Annual performance related bonus scheme
In order to link executive remuneration to Group performance, executive Directors participate in bonus schemes appropriate to their objectives. For the 
year ended 31 March 2012 the bonus in respect of Tim Hair and Mark Bache was linked to the profit performance of the Group and the achievement of 
personal objectives. The maximum amount of bonus payable is 100% of their basic salary. 
(c) Share options
An incentive to achieve longer-term improvements in shareholder value is a orded through two share option schemes which were established in 2007. 
The key features of the schemes are summarised as follows:
(i) A Performance Share Plan which grants nil cost options under an Enterprise Management Scheme (EMI Options ). The EMI Options will normally 
become exercisable in three equal tranches on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant subject to the satisfaction of 
a performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee of the Company. The proportion of awards that become exercisable under each 
tranche of the EMI Option varies on a straight-line basis, from 25% to 100%, for average growth in underlying fully diluted EPS of between 5% p.a. 
and 10% p.a. above RPI over the period between grant and exercise dates. No options are exercisable if growth is below this range.
(ii) Non-EMI qualifying options are also granted at nil cost under the Performance Share Plan. Non-EMI options become exercisable on the third 
anniversary of the date of grant subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee of the Company. The 
proportion of Non-EMI awards that become exercisable varies on a straight-line basis from 25% to 100% based on the Company's TSR ranking 
against a comparator group of companies between the median and upper quartile ranking. No options are exercisable if growth is below this 
range. These options expire on the 10th anniversary of grant.
(iii) A Share Option Plan (SOP ) which issues options at the average quoted market price of the Company's shares over a period of up to ninety 
trading days prior to grant. The options will normally become exercisable on or after the third anniversary of the date of grant subject to the 
satisfaction of performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee of the Company. The proportion of awards that become exercisable 
varies on a straight-line basis, from 25% to 100%, for average growth in Total Shareholder Return of between 23.8% and 50.7% per annum over the 
period between the grant and vesting dates. This is equivalent to achieving a share price in the range of 100p to 180p. No options are exercisable if 
growth is below this range. 
Certain options were granted under this scheme (as detailed on page 28) in parallel to the options outstanding under schemes (i) and (ii) above. 
These parallel options are only tested against the above vesting conditions, and hence are potentially eligible to vest, in the event that the options 
that they are granted in parallel to fail to vest.

Performance Graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance compared to the performance of the FTSE Engineering and Machinery index over a five year period, 
measured by total shareholder return. This index has been selected as an appropriate benchmark because it represents the market sector in which the 
Company operates.
Total shareholder return is calculated to show the theoretical growth in the value of a shareholding over a specified period, assuming that dividends are 
re-invested to purchase additional shares.
