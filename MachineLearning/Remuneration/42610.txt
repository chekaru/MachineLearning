DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee comprises the three non-executive Directors: Alan Howarth (Chairman), Keith Butler-Wheelhouse and Keith Jackson.  
The committee meets when necessary, usually at least twice per year, and is responsible for determining the remuneration packages of the executive  
Directors and of the Chairman.
POLICY ON REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND SENIOR EXECUTIVES
The committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages offered are designed to attract, maintain and motivate high calibre Directors and senior executives, 
without paying more than necessary for the purpose. The remuneration policy attempts to match the interests of the executives with those of shareholders by 
providing:-
(a) Basic salary and benefits
  Executive Directors' basic salaries are reviewed each year, taking into account the performance of the individual and rates of salary for similar jobs in 
companies of comparable size. The main benefits provided are company cars and health insurance.
  The Company operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes for the majority of its employees, including executive Directors.  
No performance related bonuses nor benefits in kind are included in pensionable salary.
(b) Annual performance related bonus scheme
  In order to link executive remuneration to Group performance, executive Directors participate in bonus schemes appropriate to their objectives.  
For the year ended 31 March 2013 the bonus in respect of Tim Hair was linked to the profit performance of the Group and the achievement of personal 
objectives. The maximum amount of bonus payable is 100% of his basic salary. 
(c) Share options
  An incentive to achieve longer-term improvements in shareholder value is afforded through three share option schemes which were established in 2007. 
The key features of the schemes are summarised as follows:
i. A Performance Share Plan which grants nil cost options under an Enterprise Management Scheme (EMI Options ). The EMI Options will 
normally become exercisable in three equal tranches on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant subject to the 
satisfaction of a performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee of the Company. The proportion of awards that become exercisable 
under each tranche of the EMI Option varies on a straight line basis, from 25% to 100%, for average growth in underlying fully diluted EPS of 
between 5% p.a. and 10% p.a. above RPI over the period between grant and exercise dates. No options are exercisable if growth is below this range.
ii. Non-EMI qualifying options are also granted at nil cost under the Performance Share Plan. Non-EMI options become exercisable on the third 
anniversary of the date of grant subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee of the Company.  
The proportion of Non-EMI awards that become exercisable varies on a straight line basis from 25% to 100% based on the Company's TSR ranking 
against a comparator group of companies between the median and upper quartile ranking. No options are exercisable if growth is below this 
range. These options expire on the 10th anniversary of grant.
iii. A Share Option Plan (SOP ) which issues options at the average quoted market price of the Company's shares over a period of up to ninety 
trading days prior to grant. The options will normally become exercisable on or after the third anniversary of the date of grant subject to the 
satisfaction of performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee of the Company. The proportion of awards that become exercisable 
varies on a straight line basis, from 25% to 100%, for average growth in Total Shareholder Return of between 23.8% and 50.7% per annum over the 
period between the grant and vesting dates. This is equivalent to achieving a share price in the range of 100p to 180p. No options are exercisable if 
growth is below this range. 
  Certain options were granted under this scheme (as detailed on page 31) in parallel to the options outstanding under schemes (i) and (ii) above. These 
parallel options are only tested against the above vesting conditions, and hence are potentially eligible to vest, in the event that the options that they are 
granted in parallel to fail to vest.  22531.04    18 June 2013 12:20 PM    Proof 6

Options marked # are granted in parallel to options in existence at 31 March 2009, as noted above. These options are only tested against the vesting conditions 
as set out on page 29 (and thus potentially become eligible to vest), in the event that the options that they are granted in parallel to fail to vest. Only the original 
options or the parallel options can vest, not both.
Where applicable, option grants are exercisable only upon the achievement of the performance targets explained on page 29.
No consideration is payable for the grant of an option, which is exercisable at a price to be determined by the Remuneration Committee at the time when the 
option is granted as detailed above.
The exercise of share options resulted in a gain for Tim Hair of  10,000 (2012:  134,000) and a gain for Mark Bache of  nil (2012:  53,000). At the time of exercise 
the Company's share price was 119.5p (2012: 132p).
273,221 (2012: 287,334) options lapsed as the vesting criteria were not met. 419,078 options in favour of Mark Bache were forfeited following his removal from 
the Board.
There have been no changes in the interests set out above between 1 April 2013 and 21 May 2013 save the alteration to the exercise date of options outstanding 
for Tim Hair.
The mid-market price of the shares at 31 March 2013 was 102p and during the year ranged between 187.5p and 102p.
