Introduction
The Directors have 
included the annual 
financial review, which 
forms part of the Strategic 
Report, on the following 
pages as commentary on 
the primary statements.
Whilst the accounting policies adopted by 
the Company are an important part of our 
Annual Report, we recognise that many 
readers of the Financial Statements prefer to 
use these as a reference tool. These policies 
are now included towards the end of the 
Financial Statements, rather than at the 
beginning. 
We included 26 notes to the Group Financial 
Statements in the previous year and while 
all of this information is necessary to ensure 
we comply with International Financial 
Reporting Standards, it does not always make 
it easy to find what you are looking for. We 
have therefore restructured the notes into 
five new categories (as outlined in the table 
of contents on the previous page) for easier 
navigation.
Introduction and  
Table of Contents
These financial statements are presented in 
a manner which attempts to make them less 
complex and more relevant to shareholders. 
We have grouped notes in sections under five 
headings:  Basis of Preparation',  Results for the 
Year',  Operating Assets and Liabilities',  Capital 
Structure' and  other supporting notes'. The 
purpose of this format is to provide readers 
with a clearer understanding of what drives 
the financial performance of the Group. 
Notes to the financial statements provide 
additional information required by statute, 
accounting standards to explain a particular 
feature of the financial statements. The notes 
that follow will also provide explanations 
and additional disclosure to assist readers' 
understanding and interpretation of the 
Annual Report and the financial statements.
