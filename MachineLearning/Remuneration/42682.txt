Board report on remuneration
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, established in 1994, comprises the Group's Non-executive Directors. Accordingly, the members
of the Committee during the year were Mr C R Godwin (until 26 July 2002), Mr J Standen (from 1 June 2002) and Mr A B Reeve.
Prior to 26 July 2002 it was chaired by Mr C R Godwin and since that date by Mr J Standen.
The terms of reference of the Committee require and empower it to determine the total remuneration package of each of the
Executive Directors and also, after discussion with the Chief Executive, to agree with him the total remuneration package of each
of the senior executives in the Group.
During the year the Committee sought advice upon limited remuneration matters from Monks Partnership, a business
of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
The constitution and operation of the Committee complied throughout the year with Section 1B of the Combined Code
incorporated into the United Kingdom Listing Authority Listing Rules.
The disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 to be audited are those denoted by * .
Policy
The Committee's policy and objective are to contribute to the management of the Company in the best interests of shareholders
by encouraging senior executives to identify themselves with the business and to share in its growth in value.
The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is set by the Board on which matter the Non-executives play no part.
Service contracts
Mr B Leckie, the Chief Executive, has a contract dated 27 May 1999. It can be terminated by the Company giving two years' notice
or by Mr Leckie giving six months' notice. His contract provides for a predetermined or liquidated sum by way of damages (broadly
speaking, the remuneration which would have been payable during his contractual notice period less a suitable discount) if it is
terminated following a successful bid for the Company.
Mr A L Thompson has a contract dated 27 May 1999. It can be terminated by the Company giving two years' notice or by
Mr Thompson giving six months' notice. It does not give any right to a predetermined or liquidated sum by way of damages.
Mr Leckie and Mr Thompson were appointed to the Board in 1996 and 1997 respectively, when the Committee took the view that
two year notice periods for such senior positions were reasonable, having regard to prevailing practice at that time. The Committee
is aware of the requirements of the Combined Code for executive directors' contracts and conforms with best practice for any new
appointment. The contract agreed with Mr A P Weatherstone, upon his appointment as Finance Director in January 2003, provides
for a one year notice period to be given by the Company, but may be terminated by Mr Weatherstone giving six months' notice.
This contract, dated 27 November 2002, does not give any right to a predetermined or liquidated sum by way of damages.
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts.
Directors' emoluments
Particulars of Directors' total emoluments are disclosed later within this Board Report on Remuneration. Basic salaries are established
by reference to the competitive market place and are reviewed annually on 1 April or when a change in responsibilities occurs.
Annual performance bonus in cash
Executive Directors participate in an annual cash bonus scheme, providing a percentage of basic salary related to growth in profit
before tax when measured against the prior year, with a cap of 50% of basic salary, for achieving growth in excess of 25%.
Benefits in kind
The main elements, which are common within the industry, are the provision of a motor car for business and private use and
medical insurance. The benefits are valued in accordance with Inland Revenue rules.
Transactions with the Company
At no time during the year had any Director a material interest in any contract which was of significance to the Company's business.

Board report on remuneration
Pensions
Executive Directors are members of the Chapelthorpe plc Pension Fund, which is a defined benefit scheme with a maximum
pension of two thirds of final pensionable salary payable not earlier than age 62 and subject to satisfying service requirements.
Basic salary only is taken into account in calculating final pensionable salary under the rules of the scheme. However, each Executive
Director is subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap.
The Company set up the Chapelthorpe plc Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme ( 'FURBS'') for the benefit of Mr B Leckie
and Mr A L Thompson. The FURBS seeks to provide each of its members with the contractual entitlement to the pension to which
they would have been entitled but for the Inland Revenue earnings cap. A pension bonus is paid to cover the members' income tax
liabilities in respect of the Company's contributions to the FURBS.
Mr J D Riley received the pension bonus of  15,000 per annum in recognition of the pension benefits foregone as a result of the
Inland Revenue earnings cap.
Options and awards
Share incentives are in the form of Chapelthorpe's share option schemes, details of which are set out below. The Remuneration
Committee is responsible for the operation of these schemes and grants options (or where appropriate awards rights) based upon
each executive's remuneration, performance and contribution to the Group. The Committee considers that these schemes provide
a strong link between reward and performance, with an emphasis on producing sustained improvements in the underlying
performance of Chapelthorpe plc and in aligning the executive's performance and reward with the interests of shareholders.
Details of Directors', and all, outstanding options and awards are shown later within this Board Report on Remuneration, and
in Note 18 on page 37, respectively.
Options granted under the Chapelthorpe plc Executive Share Option Scheme 1994 and the Chapelthorpe plc 1996 Parallel Executive
Share Option Scheme are exercisable in the event that the percentage increase in normalised earnings per share, over a relevant
three year period exceeds the percentage increase in the Retail Prices Index over the same period plus 6% and 12%, respectively.
Under the Chapelthorpe plc 1998 Performance Related Share Plan, specific performance conditions are set, the attainment of which
will determine whether, and to what extent, the award will vest. In respect of awards made prior to 1 April 2001, the performance
criteria are based on the Company's Total Shareholder Return ( 'TSR'') over a three year period (the  'Performance Period'') beginning
at the commencement of the financial year in which the award is made.
Such awards will not vest unless:
i) there has been an increase in normalised earnings per share (being earnings per share before non-operating exceptional items)
of the Company during the Performance Period equal to or greater than the increase in the Retail Prices Index over the same
period; and
ii) the Company's TSR in the Performance Period relative to the average of that of a group of other comparable companies listed
on the London Stock Exchange (the  'Comparator Group''), having similarities to the Company in terms of market sector or
market capitalisation or turnover at the beginning of the Performance Period as determined by the Remuneration Committee,
is ranked at least at the median of the Comparator Group.
TSR is the annual compound return received on a share measured by reference to the increase in the price of a share over the
Performance Period and the gross value of dividends and other benefits received on the share and reinvested on the day that share
was declared ex-dividend. An award will vest in full if the Company is ranked in the top quartile of the Comparator Group; 30%
of an award will vest if the Company is ranked at the median and pro-rata between these two points.
Certain awards made under the 1998 Performance Related Share Plan matured on 31 March 2003. The Remuneration Committee
has determined that the performance conditions have not been met and that the awards will not vest. These were the final awards
under the Chapelthorpe plc 1998 Performance Related Share Plan to be assessed by reference to the TSR criteria. 
Following the receipt of independent advice, and recognising the difficulty in maintaining a fair Comparator Group listing, given the
significant reduction in comparable listed companies, the Committee decided that an earnings per share basis was more appropriate
in aligning the interests of shareholders with the recipients of the awards. 
Consequently, in respect of awards made under the 1998 Performance Related Share Plan during 2001 and 2002, the Remuneration
Committee has determined that the awards will vest after the Performance Period:
i) as to 30% if the normalised earnings per share in the final year of the Performance Period exceed 4.5 pence;
ii) as to 100% if the normalised earnings per share in the final year of the Performance Period exceed 6.5 pence;
iii) for normalised earnings per share in the final year of the Performance Period between 4.5 pence and 6.5 pence
the apportionment is on a straight line basis.
_1CHA_arb03.qxd  25/06/2003  09:06  Page 17 Options and awards (continued)
The future earnings per share targets are at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Under the normalised earnings per share
calculation, the loss per share for the year ended 31 March 2002 was (0.11) pence per share and for the year ended 31 March 2003
was earnings of 0.62 pence per share.
Given the inherent nature of those schemes, the exercise of options granted under the Chapelthorpe plc Savings Related Share
Option Scheme 1994 and the award of shares under the Chapelthorpe plc Invested Bonus Share Plan 1997, are not conditional
on any performance criteria.
In 1996 the Company established the Chapelthorpe plc 1996 Employee Benefit Trust (the  'Trust''). Since then, the trustees of the
Trust have been put in funds by the Company to enable them to buy, in the market, ordinary shares in the Company. These shares
have been used to make awards under the Invested Bonus Share Plan 1997 and the 1998 Performance Related Share Plan. At the
year end the market value of all ordinary shares held by the Trust was  245,000.
Performance graph
Change in value of a hypothetical  100 holding in Chapelthorpe plc ordinary shares:
The graphs illustrate the performance of Chapelthorpe plc ordinary shares measured by total shareholder return (share price growth
plus dividends paid) against a broad equity market index over the past five years and over the period since 1 April 2002.
The FTSE Household Goods & Textiles Index was considered by the Remuneration Committee to be the most relevant index
in this context as it represents the sector within which Chapelthorpe plc is quoted.
Directors' share interests
The Register of Directors' Interests is available for inspection by the public.
The interests (which are all beneficial) of the Directors who held office at 31 March 2003, and of their families, in the ordinary
