 Board report on remuneration
CHAPELTHORPE PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2004 16
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Group's Non-executive Directors, Mr J Standen and Mr A B Reeve. It is chaired by 
Mr J Standen.
The terms of reference of the Committee require and empower it to determine the total remuneration package of each of the
Executive Directors and also, after discussion with the Chief Executive, to agree with him the total remuneration package of each
of the senior executives in the Group.
During the year the Committee sought advice upon remuneration matters from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, who are retained
by the Company solely for the provision of advice on such matters.
The constitution and operation of the Committee complied throughout the year with Section 1B of the Combined Code
incorporated into the United Kingdom Listing Authority Rules.
The disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 to be audited are those denoted by *.
Policy
The Committee's policy and objective are to contribute to the management of the Company in the best interests of shareholders
by encouraging senior executives to identify themselves with the business and to share in its growth in value. 
The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is set by the Board on which matter the Non-executives play no part.
Service contracts
Mr B Leckie, the Chief Executive, has a contract dated 27 May 1999. It can be terminated by Mr Leckie giving six months' notice.
His contract provides for a predetermined or liquidated sum by way of damages (broadly speaking, the remuneration which would
have been payable during a specified notice period less a suitable discount) if it is terminated following a successful bid for the
Company. By a variation to his contract dated 22 January 2004, Mr Leckie has agreed to a reduction in this specified notice period
from two years to one year. This change was effective from 1 January 2004.
Mr A L Thompson has a contract dated 27 May 1999. It can be terminated by Mr Thompson giving six months' notice. It does not
give any right to a predetermined or liquidated sum by way of damages.
By variations to their service contracts dated 22 January 2004, Mr Leckie and Mr Thompson have agreed to a reduction in the notice
period to which they are entitled from the Company. This notice period will reduce from two years to one year over a 12 month period.
As a result, both Mr Leckie and Mr Thompson will be entitled to a one year notice period from the Company from December 2004.
Mr A P Weatherstone has a contract dated 27 November 2002 which provides for a one year notice period to be given by the
Company, but may be terminated by Mr Weatherstone giving six months' notice. It does not give any right to a predetermined
or liquidated sum by way of damages.
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts.
Directors' emoluments
Particulars of Directors' total emoluments are disclosed later within this Board Report on Remuneration. Basic salaries are established
by reference to the competitive market place and are reviewed annually on 1 April or when a change in responsibilities occurs.
Performance related bonus
Executive Directors participate in an annual cash bonus scheme. Consistent with the Committee's policy for linking performance
to delivering improved value for shareholders and meeting market expectations, the bonus scheme gives the Executive Directors
the potential to receive annual benefits up to a maximum value of 85% of basic salary for exceptional performance. The criteria
are agreed by the Committee each year and include up to 10% for achievement of personal objectives. Under the rules of the
performance related bonus scheme, 50% of the net (post-tax) bonus must be invested in ordinary shares of the Company through,
and in accordance with the rules of, the Invested Bonus Share Plan 1997. 
Benefits in kind
The main elements, which are common within the industry, are the provision of a motor car for business and private use and
medical insurance. The benefits are valued in accordance with Inland Revenue rules.
Transactions with the Company
At no time during the year had any Director a material interest in any contract which was of significance to the Company's business. Board report on remuneration
CHAPELTHORPE PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2004 17
Pensions
Executive Directors are members of the Chapelthorpe plc Pension Fund, which is a defined benefit scheme with a maximum
pension of two thirds of final pensionable salary payable not earlier than age 62 and subject to satisfying service requirements.
Basic salary only is taken into account in calculating final pensionable salary under the rules of the scheme. However, each Executive
Director is subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap.
The Company set up the Chapelthorpe plc Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme (FURBS) for the benefit of Mr B Leckie
and Mr A L Thompson. The FURBS seeks to provide each of its members with the contractual entitlement to the pension to which
they would have been entitled but for the Inland Revenue earnings cap. A pension bonus is paid to cover the members' income tax
liabilities in respect of the Company's contributions to the FURBS.
Options and awards
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the operation of the Company's share schemes and grants options (or where
appropriate awards rights) based upon each executive's remuneration, performance and contribution to the Group. The Committee
considers that these schemes provide a strong link between reward and performance, with an emphasis on producing sustained
improvements in the underlying performance of Chapelthorpe plc and in aligning the executive's performance and reward with the
interests of shareholders.
Details of Directors', and all, outstanding options and awards are shown later within this Board Report on Remuneration, and
in Note 18 on page 37, respectively.
Executive share option schemes
Options granted under the Chapelthorpe plc Executive Share Option Scheme 1994 and the Chapelthorpe plc 1996 Parallel Executive
Share Option Scheme are exercisable in the event that the percentage increase in normalised earnings per share, over a relevant
three year period exceeds the percentage increase in the Retail Prices Index over the same period plus 6% and 12%, respectively.
Performance Related Share Plan
Under the Chapelthorpe plc 1998 Performance Related Share Plan, specific performance conditions are set, the attainment of which
will determine whether, and to what extent, the award will vest. The performance criteria are assessed over a three year period
(the Performance Period) beginning at the commencement of the financial year in which the award is made.
In respect of awards made under the 1998 Performance Related Share Plan during 2001 and 2002, the Remuneration Committee
has determined that the awards will vest after the Performance Period:
i) as to 30% if the normalised earnings per share in the final year of the Performance Period exceed 4.5 pence;
ii) as to 100% if the normalised earnings per share in the final year of the Performance Period exceed 6.5 pence;
iii) for normalised earnings per share in the final year of the Performance Period between 4.5 pence and 6.5 pence the apportionment
is on a straight line basis;
where normalised earnings per share refers to earnings per share before non-operating exceptional items.
Awards made in 2001 under the 1998 Performance Related Share Plan matured on 31 March 2004. The Remuneration Committee
has determined that the performance conditions have not been met and that the awards will not vest.
In respect of awards made under the 1998 Performance Related Share Plan in 2003, the Remuneration Committee has determined
that the awards will vest after the Performance Period:
i) as to 15% if operating profit grows at an average rate of 7.5% per annum over the Performance Period;
ii) as to 100% if operating profit grows at an average rate of 15% per annum over the Performance Period;
iii) the awards will vest pro-rata for operating profit growth between these two points.
If the operating profit performance criteria is achieved, there is a further and predetermined minimum achievement in respect
of underlying earnings per share growth that must also be achieved, prior to an award vesting. Operating profit and underlying
earnings per share are calculated before taking account of goodwill amortisation and exceptional items (both operating and
non-operating). Options and awards (continued)
Invested Bonus Share Plan and SAYE
Given the inherent nature of these schemes, the exercise of options granted under the Chapelthorpe plc Savings Related Share
Option Scheme 1994 and the award of shares under the Chapelthorpe plc Invested Bonus Share Plan 1997, are not conditional
on any performance criteria.
New share option schemes
The Chapelthorpe plc Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1994 and Chapelthorpe plc Executive Share Option Scheme 1994
come to the end of their ten year lives this year. Having taken appropriate advice from its remuneration consultants, the Company
is seeking shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting to introduce a new Chapelthorpe plc Savings Related Share Option
Scheme 2004 and a new Chapelthorpe plc Executive Share Option Plan 2004. If approved, the Chapelthorpe plc 1996 Parallel
Executive Share Option Scheme will also be terminated. 
A description of the main features of these new employee share schemes is given in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
The key points to note are:
  the proposed Chapelthorpe plc Savings Related Share Option Scheme 2004 is very similar to the 1994 sharesave scheme save
for changes in the tax legislation over this period;
  the proposed Chapelthorpe plc Executive Share Option Plan 2004 will be used to grant options to senior executives and
directors, but excluding the Executive Directors of Chapelthorpe plc who will continue to participate in the Chapelthorpe plc
1998 Performance Related Share Plan;
  under the proposed Chapelthorpe plc Executive Share Option Plan 2004 the maximum option grant that can be made to any
individual in any financial year is over shares worth 80% of the individual's salary at the date of grant; and
  the exercise of options under the proposed Chapelthorpe plc Executive Share Option Plan 2004 will be subject to a performance
condition requiring the Company's earnings per share to exceed the increase in inflation plus 3% per annum over the three year
vesting period, and generally the individual's continued employment over the three years beginning with the date of grant. 
Employee Benefit Trust
In 1996 the Company established the Chapelthorpe plc 1996 Employee Benefit Trust (the Trust). Since then, the trustees of the
Trust have been put in funds by the Company to enable them to buy, in the market, ordinary shares in the Company. These shares
have been used to make awards under the Invested Bonus Share Plan 1997 and the 1998 Performance Related Share Plan. At the
year end the market value of all ordinary shares held by the Trust was  631,000.
Performance graph
Change in value of a hypothetical  100 holding in Chapelthorpe plc ordinary shares:
The graphs illustrate the performance of Chapelthorpe plc ordinary shares measured by total shareholder return (share price growth
plus dividends paid) against a broad equity market index over the past five years and over the period since 31 March 2003.
The FTSE Fledgling Index was considered by the Remuneration Committee to be the most relevant in this context as it represents
the index within which Chapelthorpe plc is quoted.
