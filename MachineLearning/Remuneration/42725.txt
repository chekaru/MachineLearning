 BOARD REPORT ON REMUNERATION
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Group's Non-executive Directors, Mr J Standen, Mr A B Reeve and, from 10 January 2005,
Mr J A Biles. It is chaired by Mr Standen.
The terms of reference of the Committee require and empower it to determine the total remuneration package of each of the Executive
Directors and also, after discussion with the Chief Executive, to agree with him the total remuneration package of each of the senior
executives in the Group.
During the year the Committee sought advice upon remuneration matters from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, who are retained
by the Company solely for the provision of advice on such matters.
The constitution and operation of the Committee complied throughout the year with Section 1B of the Combined Code incorporated into
the United Kingdom Listing Authority Rules, with the exception that only since the appointment of Mr J A Biles on 10 January 2005 has
the Committee comprised of two independent Non-executive Directors (excluding the Chairman). During 2004/05 the Committee met
five times, with each Committee member attending on each occasion.
POLICY
The Committee's policy and objective are to contribute to the management of the Company in the best interests of shareholders
by encouraging senior executives to identify themselves with the business and to share in its growth in value. 
The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is set by the Board on which matter the Non-executives play no part.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
Mr B Leckie, the Chief Executive, has a contract dated 27 May 1999 subsequently amended by a variation dated 22 January 2004.
It can be terminated by the Company giving one year's notice or by Mr Leckie giving six months' notice. His contract provides for
a predetermined or liquidated sum by way of damages (broadly speaking, the remuneration which would have been payable during
his contractual notice period less a suitable discount) if it is terminated following a successful bid for the Company. 
Mr A L Thompson has a contract dated 27 May 1999 subsequently amended by a variation dated 22 January 2004. It can be terminated
by the Company giving one year's notice or by Mr Thompson giving six months' notice. It does not give any right to a predetermined or
liquidated sum by way of damages.
Mr A P Weatherstone has a contract dated 27 November 2002 which provides for a one year notice period to be given by the Company,
but may be terminated by Mr Weatherstone giving six months' notice. It does not give any right to a predetermined or liquidated sum
by way of damages.
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts.
DIRECTORS' EMOLUMENTS
Particulars of Directors' total emoluments are disclosed later within this Board Report on Remuneration. Basic salaries are established
by reference to the competitive market place and are reviewed annually on 1 April or when a change in responsibilities occurs.
PERFORMANCE RELATED BONUS
Executive Directors participate in an annual cash bonus scheme. Consistent with the Committee's policy for linking performance to delivering
improved value for shareholders and meeting market expectations, the bonus scheme gives the Executive Directors the potential to receive
annual benefits up to a maximum value of 85% of basic salary for exceptional performance. The criteria are agreed by the Committee
each year and include elements for both profit and strategic objectives. Under the rules of the performance related bonus scheme,
50% of the net (post-tax) bonus must be invested in ordinary shares of the Company through, and in accordance with the rules of,
the Invested Bonus Share Plan 1997. 
15 Chapelthorpe plc Report & Accounts 2005 BENEFITS IN KIND
The main elements, which are common within the industry, are the provision of a motor car for business and private use and medical
insurance. The benefits are valued in accordance with Inland Revenue rules.
TRANSACTIONS WITH THE COMPANY
At no time during the year had any Director a material interest in any contract which was of significance to the Group's business.
PENSIONS
Executive Directors are members of the Chapelthorpe plc Pension Fund, which is a defined benefit scheme with a maximum pension
of two thirds of final pensionable salary payable not earlier than age 62 and subject to satisfying service requirements. Basic salary only
is taken into account in calculating final pensionable salary under the rules of the scheme. However, each Executive Director is subject
to the Inland Revenue earnings cap.
The Company set up the Chapelthorpe plc Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme (FURBS ) for the benefit of Mr B Leckie and
Mr A L Thompson. The FURBS seeks to provide each of its members with the contractual entitlement to the pension to which they would
have been entitled but for the Inland Revenue earnings cap. A pension bonus is paid to cover the members' income tax liabilities in respect
of the Company's contributions to the FURBS.
OPTIONS AND AWARDS
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the operation of the Company's share schemes and grants options (or where appropriate
awards rights) based upon each executive's remuneration, performance and contribution to the Group. The Committee considers that
these schemes provide a strong link between reward and performance, with an emphasis on producing sustained improvements in the
underlying performance of Chapelthorpe plc and in aligning the executive's performance and reward with the interests of shareholders.
Details of Directors', and all, outstanding options and awards are shown later within this Board Report on Remuneration, and in Note 18
on page 38, respectively.
EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
Options granted under the Chapelthorpe plc Executive Share Option Scheme 1994 and the Chapelthorpe plc 1996 Parallel Executive
Share Option Scheme are exercisable in the event that the percentage increase in normalised earnings per share over a relevant three
year period exceeds the percentage increase in the Retail Prices Index over the same period plus 6% and 12%, respectively.
The exercise of options under the Chapelthorpe plc Executive Share Option Plan 2004 is subject to a performance condition requiring
the Company's earnings per share to exceed the increase in inflation plus 3% per annum over the three year vesting period. To date
no options have been granted under this Plan.

OPTIONS AND AWARDS (CONTINUED)
PERFORMANCE RELATED SHARE PLAN
Under the Chapelthorpe plc 1998 Performance Related Share Plan, specific performance conditions are set, the attainment of which
will determine whether, and to what extent, the award will vest. The performance criteria are assessed over a three year period
(the Performance Period ) beginning at the commencement of the financial year in which the award is made.
In respect of awards made under the 1998 Performance Related Share Plan during 2002, the Remuneration Committee has determined
that the awards will vest after the Performance Period:
i) as to 30% if the normalised earnings per share in the final year of the Performance Period exceed 4.5 pence;
ii) as to 100% if the normalised earnings per share in the final year of the Performance Period exceed 6.5 pence;
iii) for normalised earnings per share in the final year of the Performance Period between 4.5 pence and 6.5 pence the apportionment
is on a straight line basis;
where normalised earnings per share refers to earnings per share before non-operating exceptional items.
Awards made in 2002 under the 1998 Performance Related Share Plan matured on 31 March 2005. The Remuneration Committee
has determined that the performance conditions have not been met and that the awards will not vest.
In respect of awards made under the 1998 Performance Related Share Plan in 2003 and 2004, the Remuneration Committee has determined
that the awards will vest after the Performance Period:
i) as to 15% if operating profit grows at an average rate of 7.5% per annum over the Performance Period;
ii) as to 100% if operating profit grows at an average rate of 15% per annum over the Performance Period;
iii) the awards will vest pro-rata for operating profit growth between these two points.
If the operating profit performance criteria is achieved, there is a further and predetermined minimum achievement in respect of underlying
earnings per share growth that must also be achieved, prior to an award vesting. Operating profit and underlying earnings per share are
calculated before taking account of goodwill amortisation and exceptional items (both operating and non-operating).
INVESTED BONUS SHARE PLAN AND SAYE
Given the inherent nature of these schemes, the exercise of options granted under the Chapelthorpe plc Savings Related Share Option
Scheme 1994 and the Chapelthorpe plc Savings Related Share Option Scheme 2004 and the award of shares under the Chapelthorpe plc
Invested Bonus Share Plan 1997, are not conditional on any performance criteria.
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUST
In 1996 the Company established the Chapelthorpe plc 1996 Employee Benefit Trust (the Trust ). Since then, the trustees of the Trust
have been put in funds by the Company to enable them to buy, in the market, ordinary shares in the Company. These shares have been
used to make awards under the Invested Bonus Share Plan 1997 and the 1998 Performance Related Share Plan. At the year end the
market value of all ordinary shares held by the Trust was  786,000.

The graphs illustrate the performance of Chapelthorpe plc ordinary shares measured by total shareholder return (share price growth plus
dividends paid) against a broad equity market index over the past five years and over the period since 31 March 2004.

within which Chapelthorpe plc is quoted.
