BOARD REPORT ON REMUNERATION
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Group's Non-executive Directors, Mr J Standen, Mr A B Reeve and Mr J A Biles. It is chaired
by Mr Standen.
The terms of reference of the Committee require and empower it to determine the total remuneration package of each of the Executive
Directors and also, after discussion with the Chief Executive, to agree with him the total remuneration package of each of the senior
executives in the Group.
During the year the Committee sought advice upon remuneration matters from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, who are retained
by the Company solely for the provision of advice on such matters. The Committee also sought advice upon pensions matters from the
Company's pensions adviser, KPMG LLP.
The constitution and operation of the Committee complied throughout the year with Section 1B of the Combined Code incorporated
into the United Kingdom Listing Authority Rules. During 2005/06 the Committee met six times, with each Committee member attending
on each occasion.
The only information within the Board Report on Remuneration that is required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985
to be audited is that as shown on pages 23 and 24.
POLICY
The Committee's policy and objective are to contribute to the management of the Company in the best interests of shareholders by
encouraging senior executives to identify themselves with the business and to share in its growth in value. 
The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is set by the Board on which matter the Non-executives play no part.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
Mr B Leckie, the Chief Executive, has a contract dated 27 May 1999 subsequently amended by a variation dated 22 January 2004. It can
be terminated by the Company giving one year's notice or by Mr Leckie giving six months' notice. His contract provides for a predetermined
or liquidated sum by way of damages (broadly speaking, the remuneration which would have been payable during his contractual notice
period less a suitable discount) if it is terminated following a successful bid for the Company. 
Mr A P Weatherstone has a contract dated 27 November 2002 which provides for a one year notice period to be given by the Company,
but may be terminated by Mr Weatherstone giving six months' notice. It does not give any right to a predetermined or liquidated sum by
way of damages.
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts.
DIRECTORS' EMOLUMENTS
Particulars of Directors' total emoluments are disclosed later within this Board Report on Remuneration. Basic salaries are established by
reference to the competitive market place and are reviewed annually on 1 April or when a change in responsibilities occurs.
PERFORMANCE RELATED BONUS
Executive Directors participate in an annual cash bonus scheme. Consistent with the Committee's policy for linking performance to
delivering improved value for shareholders and meeting market expectations, the bonus scheme gives the Executive Directors the
potential to receive annual benefits up to a maximum value of 85% of basic salary for exceptional performance. The criteria are agreed
by the Committee each year and include elements for both profit and strategic objectives. Under the rules of the performance related
bonus scheme, 50% of the net (post-tax) bonus must be invested in ordinary shares of the Company through, and in accordance with
the rules of, the Invested Bonus Share Plan 1997.

BENEFITS IN KIND
The main elements, which are common within the industry, are the provision of a motor car for business and private use and medical
and life insurance. The benefits are valued in accordance with Inland Revenue rules.
TRANSACTIONS WITH THE COMPANY
At no time during the year had any Director a material interest in any contract which was of significance to the Group's business.
PENSIONS
Mr B Leckie is a member of the Chapelthorpe plc Pension Fund, which is a defined benefit scheme with a maximum pension of two
thirds of final pensionable salary payable not earlier than age 62 and subject to satisfying service requirements. Basic salary only is taken
into account in calculating final pensionable salary under the rules of the scheme. However, Mr Leckie is subject to the Inland Revenue
earnings cap.
The Company previously set up the Chapelthorpe plc Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme (FURBS ) for the benefit of
Mr Leckie. The FURBS seeks to provide Mr Leckie with the contractual entitlement to the pension to which he would have been entitled
but for the Inland Revenue earnings cap. A pension bonus is paid to cover Mr Leckie's income tax liabilities in respect of the Company's
contributions to the FURBS.
Mr A L Thompson also remained a member of the Chapelthorpe plc Pension Fund and the FURBS throughout the period during which
he was an Executive Director of Chapelthorpe plc. 
During the year, the Committee sourced specific advice from KPMG LLP, the Company's pensions adviser, in relation to pension provision
for Executive Directors of the Company, given changes to pensions legislation, effective from 6 April 2006. This resulted in a number of
changes, as outlined below.
As a consequence of this new legislation relating to the tax simplification of pensions, the Company's contributions to the FURBS
have ceased and have been replaced by an annual cash sum payable directly to the individual. At the option of the individual this
may be paid into a personal pension arrangement. Under this new arrangement the Company no longer provides any guarantee
to Mr Leckie or Mr Thompson as to the value of their pension provision over the Inland Revenue earnings cap (which is deemed
to continue after 6 April 2006 for these purposes).
As a further consequence of the Remuneration Committee's review of pension arrangements for the Executive Directors, with effect from
1 February 2006 Mr Weatherstone transferred from the Chapelthorpe plc Pension Fund into a personal pension arrangement to which the
Company contributes at a rate of 20% of basic salary, excluding bonuses.
OPTIONS AND AWARDS
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the operation of the Company's share schemes and grants options (or where appropriate
awards rights) based upon each executive's remuneration, performance and contribution to the Group. The Committee considers that
these schemes provide a strong link between reward and performance, with an emphasis on producing sustained improvements in the
underlying performance of Chapelthorpe plc and in aligning the executive's performance and reward with the interests of shareholders.
Details of Directors', and all, outstanding options and awards are shown later within this Board Report on Remuneration, and in Note 30
on pages 57 and 58, respectively.
EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
Options granted under the Chapelthorpe plc Executive Share Option Scheme 1994 and the Chapelthorpe plc 1996 Parallel Executive Share
Option Scheme are exercisable in the event that the percentage increase in normalised earnings per share over a relevant three year period
exceeds the percentage increase in the Retail Prices Index over the same period plus 6% and 12% respectively.
The exercise of options under the Chapelthorpe plc Executive Share Option Plan 2004 is subject to a performance condition requiring
the Company's earnings per share to exceed the increase in inflation plus 3% per annum over the three year vesting period. To date
no options have been granted under this Plan.

OPTIONS AND AWARDS CONTINUED
PERFORMANCE RELATED SHARE PLAN
Under the Chapelthorpe plc 1998 Performance Related Share Plan, specific performance conditions are set, the attainment of which
will determine whether, and to what extent, the award will vest. The performance criteria are assessed over a three year period
(the Performance Period ) beginning at the commencement of the financial year in which the award is made.
In respect of awards made under the 1998 Performance Related Share Plan in 2003 and 2004, the Remuneration Committee has
determined that the awards will vest after the Performance Period:
i) as to 15% if operating profit grows at an average rate of 7.5% per annum over the Performance Period;
ii) as to 100% if operating profit grows at an average rate of 15% per annum over the Performance Period; and
iii) the awards will vest pro-rata for operating profit growth between these two points.
If the operating profit performance criteria is achieved, there is a further and predetermined minimum achievement in respect of
underlying earnings per share growth that must also be achieved, prior to an award vesting. Operating profit and underlying earnings
per share are calculated before taking account of goodwill amortisation and exceptional items (both operating and non-operating).
Awards made in 2003 under the 1998 Performance Related Share Plan matured on 31 March 2006. The Remuneration Committee
has determined that the performance conditions have not been met and that the awards will not vest.
In respect of awards made in 2005 under the 1998 Performance Related Share Plan, the Remuneration Committee has determined that
the awards will vest after the Performance Period:
i) 0% will vest if the total shareholder return of the Company is equal to or less than that of the FTSE Fledgling Index;
ii) 30% will vest if the total shareholder return of the Company is equal to the FTSE Fledgling Index plus 1% per annum; and
iii) 100% will vest if the total shareholder return of the Company is equal to the FTSE Fledgling Index plus 7.5% per annum.
A straight line pro-rata vesting will exist for performance between the above points.
INVESTED BONUS SHARE PLAN AND SAYE
Given the inherent nature of these schemes, the exercise of options granted under the Chapelthorpe plc Savings Related Share Option
Scheme 2004 and the award of shares under the Chapelthorpe plc Invested Bonus Share Plan 1997, are not conditional on any
performance criteria. To date no options have been granted under the Chapelthorpe plc Savings Related Share Option Scheme 2004.
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUST
In 1996 the Company established the Chapelthorpe plc 1996 Employee Benefit Trust (the Trust ). Since then, the trustees of the Trust
have been put in funds by the Company to enable them to buy, in the market, ordinary shares in the Company. These shares have
been used to make awards under the Invested Bonus Share Plan 1997 and the 1998 Performance Related Share Plan. At the year end
the market value of all ordinary shares held by the Trust was  518,000.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH
Change in value of a hypothetical  100 holding in Chapelthorpe plc ordinary shares:
The graphs illustrate the performance of Chapelthorpe plc ordinary shares measured by total shareholder return (share price growth plus
dividends paid) against a broad equity market index over the past five years and over the period since 31 March 2005.
The FTSE Fledgling Index was considered by the Remuneration Committee to be the most relevant in this context as it represents the
index within which Chapelthorpe plc is quoted.
