BOARD REPORT ON REMUNERATION 
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee comprises Mr B Leckie and Mr L D Goodman who now chairs the committee following the resignation 
of Mr J Standen.
The terms of reference of the Committee require and empower it to determine the total remuneration package of each of the 
Executive Directors and also, after discussion with the Chief Executive, to agree with him the total remuneration package of each 
of the senior executives in the Group.
During the year the Committee sought advice upon remuneration matters from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP , who are retained 
by the Company solely for the provision of advice on such matters. The Committee also sought advice upon pension matters from 
the Company's pensions adviser, KPMG LLP .
The constitution and operation of the Committee complied throughout the year with Section 1B of the Combined Code incorporated 
into the United Kingdom Listing Authority Rules. During 2006/7 the Committee met six times, with each Committee member 
attending on each occasion with the exception of two meetings that Mr A B Reeve was unable to attend.
The only information within the Board Report on Remuneration that is required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 
to be audited is that as shown on pages 19 and 20.
POLICY
The Committee's policy and objective are to contribute to the management of the Company in the best interests of shareholders 
by encouraging senior executives to identify themselves with the business and to share in its growth in value. 
The remuneration of the Chairman and the Non-executive Director is set by the Board on which matter they play no part.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
Mr I D Powell has a contract which provides for a three months' notice period to be given by the Company and Mr I D Powell. It does 
not give any right to a pre-determined or liquidated sum by way of damages.
Mr A P Weatherstone has a contract which provides for a one year notice period to be given by the Company but may be 
terminated by Mr A P Weatherstone giving six months' notice. It does not give any right to a pre-determined or liquidated sum 
by way of damages.
Neither the Chairman nor the Non-executive Director have service contracts.
DIRECTORS' EMOLUMENTS
Particulars of Directors' total emoluments are disclosed later within this Board Report on Remuneration. Basic salaries are established 
by reference to the competitive market place and are reviewed annually on 1 April or when a change in responsibilities occurs.
PERFORMANCE RELATED BONUS
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in an annual cash bonus scheme. Consistent with the Committee's policy for 
linking performance to delivering improved value for shareholders, the bonus scheme gives the Executive Directors the potential 
to receive annual benefits up to a maximum value of 100% of basic salary for exceptional performance. The criteria are agreed 
by the Committee each year and are focused on achieving strategic objectives. 
BENEFITS IN KIND
Mr A P Weatherstone is provided with a motor car for business and private use and medical and life insurance. The benefits are 
valued in accordance with Inland Revenue rules. The Company provides no benefits in kind to Mr I D Powell.
TRANSACTIONS WITH THE COMPANY
At no time during the year had any Director a material interest in any contract which was of significance to the Group's business. Chapelthorpe plc

PENSIONS
Following his resignation as Chief Executive, Mr B Leckie became a deferred member of the Chapelthorpe plc Pension Fund, which 
is a defined benefit scheme with a maximum pension of two thirds of final pensionable salary payable not earlier than age 62 and 
subject to satisfying service requirements. Basic salary only is taken into account in calculating final pensionable salary under the rules 
of the scheme. However, Mr B Leckie is subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap.
The Company previously set up the Chapelthorpe plc Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme (FURBS ) for the benefit 
of Mr B Leckie. The FURBS sought to provide Mr B Leckie with the contractual entitlement to the pension to which he would have 
been entitled but for the Inland Revenue earnings cap. This was replaced by a contribution to a personal pension plan of  85,000 
in the year ended 31 March 2007.
In respect of Mr A P Weatherstone the Company contributes at a rate of 20% of basic salary, excluding bonuses, into a personal 
pension arrangement.
The Company does not have any formal pension arrangements in respect of Mr I D Powell, although by agreement, Mr I D Powell 
at his choice can elect to sacrifice part of his basic salary and instead receive pension contributions directly into a personal 
pension arrangement.
OPTIONS AND AWARDS
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the operation of the Company's share schemes and grants options (or where 
appropriate awards rights) based upon each Executive's remuneration, performance and contribution to the Group. The Committee 
considers that these schemes provide a strong link between reward and performance, with an emphasis on producing sustained 
improvements in the underlying performance of Chapelthorpe plc and in aligning the Executive's performance and reward with 
the interests of shareholders.
Details of Directors and all outstanding options and awards are shown later within this Board Report on Remuneration, 
and in Note 30 on pages 53 and 54 respectively.
EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
Options granted under the Chapelthorpe plc Executive Share Option Scheme 1994 and the Chapelthorpe plc 1996 Parallel Executive 
Share Option Scheme are exercisable in the event that the percentage increase in normalised earnings per share over a relevant three 
year period exceeds the percentage increase in the Retail Prices Index over the same period plus 6% and 12% respectively.
The exercise of options under the Chapelthorpe plc Executive Share Option Plan 2004 is subject to a performance condition requiring 
the Company's earnings per share to exceed the increase in inflation plus 3% per annum over the three year vesting period. To date 
no options have been granted under this Plan.
PERFORMANCE RELATED SHARE PLAN
Under the Chapelthorpe plc 1998 Performance Related Share Plan, specific performance conditions are set, the attainment 
of which will determine whether, and to what extent, the award will vest. The performance criteria are assessed over a three year 
period (the Performance Period ) beginning at the commencement of the financial year in which the award is made.
In respect of awards made under the 1998 Performance Related Share Plan in 2004, the Remuneration Committee has determined 
that the awards will vest after the Performance Period:
i) as to 15% if operating profit grows at an average rate of 7.5% per annum over the Performance Period;
ii) as to 100% if operating profit grows at an average rate of 15% per annum over the Performance Period; and
iii) the awards will vest pro rata for operating profit growth between these two points.
If the operating profit performance criteria are achieved, there is a further and pre-determined minimum achievement in respect 
of underlying earnings per share growth that must also be achieved, prior to an award vesting. Operating profit and underlying 
earnings per share are calculated before taking account of goodwill amortisation and exceptional items (both operating 
and non-operating). Chapelthorpe plc

BOARD REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED
OPTIONS AND AWARDS CONTINUED
PERFORMANCE RELATED SHARE PLAN CONTINUED
Awards made in 2003 under the 1998 Performance Related Share Plan matured on 31 March 2007. The Remuneration Committee 
has determined that the performance conditions have not been met and that the awards will not vest.
In respect of awards made in 2005 under the 1998 Performance Related Share Plan, the Remuneration Committee has determined 
that the awards will vest after the Performance Period:
i) 0% will vest if the total shareholder return of the Company is equal to or less than that of the FTSE Fledgling Index;
ii) 30% will vest if the total shareholder return of the Company is equal to the FTSE Fledgling Index plus 1% per annum; and
iii) 100% will vest if the total shareholder return of the Company is equal to the FTSE Fledgling Index plus 7.5% per annum.
A straight line pro rata vesting will exist for performance between the above points.
INVESTED BONUS SHARE PLAN AND SAYE
Given the inherent nature of these schemes, the exercise of options granted under the Chapelthorpe plc Savings Related Share Option 
Scheme 2004 and the award of shares under the Chapelthorpe plc Invested Bonus Share Plan 1997, are not conditional on any 
performance criteria. To date no options have been granted under the Chapelthorpe plc Savings Related Share Option Scheme 2004.
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUST
In 1996 the Company established the Chapelthorpe plc 1996 Employee Benefit Trust (the Trust ). Since then, the trustees of the 
Trust have been put in funds by the Company to enable them to buy, in the market, ordinary shares in the Company. These shares 
have been used to make awards under the Invested Bonus Share Plan 1997 and the 1998 Performance Related Share Plan. At the 
year end the market value of all ordinary shares held by the Trust was  124,746.
PERFORMANCE GRAPH
Change in value of a hypothetical  100 holding in Chapelthorpe plc ordinary shares:
The graphs illustrate the performance of Chapelthorpe plc ordinary shares measured by total shareholder return (share price growth 
plus dividends paid) against a broad equity market index over the past five years and over the period since 31 March 2006.
The FTSE Fledgling Index was considered by the Remuneration Committee to be the most relevant in this context as it represents 
the index within which Chapelthorpe plc is quoted.
