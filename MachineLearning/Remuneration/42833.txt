REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
The following is a report from the Remuneration Committee, which has been approved and adopted by the
Board for submission to shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of two independent non-executive directors, Lord Birdwood and Mr
Fenn. The policy of the Remuneration Committee is framed to give consideration to the provisions as to best
practice set out in the Combined Code.
Remuneration of Directors
Each executive director is paid a basic salary and is entitled to benefits, namely payments of pension
contributions to a suitable scheme of his choice, the use of a company car, fuel and participation in a private
health care scheme.
Each of the executive directors is also entitled under the terms of his service contract to a bonus of an
amount up to his basic salary in the event that specified performance targets are met or exceeded. These
targets require increases in earnings per share in each financial year of the Group, adjusted to exclude certain
exceptional non-trading items.
The basic salaries referred to above are reviewed every year by the Remuneration Committee. The service
contracts of the executive directors incorporate notice periods of 12 months.
These arrangements were originally agreed by the Board of Directors in May 1995, just prior to the flotation
of the Company on the London Stock Exchange, in consultation with their legal and financial advisers and
have recently been reviewed and adjusted by the Remuneration Committee. In originally establishing these
arrangements and in the recent review, due account was taken of other listed companies of comparable size
and business complexity, and in particular of the need to put in place incentive arrangements for each
executive director which would be challenging and compatible with sustainable growth in shareholder value
whilst not being over-complicated or manipulable. The Board's policy on pension arrangements is to favour
money purchase schemes rather than defined benefit (final salary ) schemes. 
The Company believes that share ownership by executive directors and senior executives strengthens the links
between their personal interests and those of the shareholders. Executive directors holding less than 10% of
the Company's issued share capital are eligible to participate in the Company's Inland Revenue approved
executive share option scheme, details of which can be found in note 17 to the accounts. All executive
directors are entitled to participate in the Company's unapproved executive share option scheme, details of
which may also be found in note 17 to the accounts.
The non-executive directors are appointed for a fixed term expiring at each Annual General Meeting of the
Company, when they may offer themselves for re-election. Lord Birdwood, Mr Fenn and Mr Horvat are each
entitled to fees, currently at the rate of  15,000 per annum, plus expenses, without any right to compensation
on early termination. Mr E Preziosi does not receive any remuneration, and Mr Cellai did not receive any
remuneration to the date of his resignation. 10 The Character Group plc annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 August 2002
