REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS CONTINUED
Directors' Remuneration Report
The Board presents the Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 August 2003.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of two independent non-executive directors, Lord Birdwood and 
Mr Fenn. The policy of the Remuneration Committee is framed to give consideration to the provisions as 
to best practice set out in the Combined Code.
Remuneration of Directors
Each executive director is paid a basic salary and is entitled to benefits, namely payments of pension
contributions to a suitable scheme of his choice, the option of the use of a company car, fuel and participation
in a private health care scheme.
Each of the executive directors is also entitled under the terms of his service contract to a bonus of an
amount up to his basic salary in the event that specified performance targets are met or exceeded. These
targets require increases in earnings per share in each financial year of the Group, adjusted to exclude certain
exceptional non-trading items.
The basic salaries referred to above are reviewed every year by the Remuneration Committee. The service
contracts of the executive directors incorporate notice periods of 12 months.
These arrangements were originally agreed by the Board of Directors in May 1995, just prior to the flotation
of the Company on the London Stock Exchange, in consultation with their legal and financial advisers and
have recently been reviewed by the Remuneration Committee. In originally establishing these arrangements,
and in the recent review, due account was taken of other listed companies of comparable size and business
complexity, and in particular of the need to put in place incentive arrangements for each executive director
which would be challenging and compatible with sustainable growth in shareholder value, whilst not being
over-complicated or manipulable. The Board's policy on pension arrangements is to favour money purchase
schemes rather than defined benefit (final salary ) schemes. 
The Company believes that share ownership by executive directors and senior executives strengthens the links
between their personal interests and those of the shareholders. Executive directors holding less than 10% of
the Company's issued share capital are eligible to participate in the Company's Inland Revenue approved
executive share option scheme, details of which can be found in note 18 to the accounts. All executive
directors are entitled to participate in the Company's unapproved executive share option scheme and in the
Company's Enterprise Management Incentive Share Option Scheme, details of which may also be found in
note 18 to the accounts.
The non-executive directors are appointed for a fixed term expiring at each Annual General Meeting of the
Company, when they may offer themselves for re-election. Lord Birdwood, Mr Fenn and Mr Horvat are each
entitled to fees, currently at the rate of  20,000 per annum (2002:  15,000), plus expenses, without any right
to compensation on early termination. Mr E Preziosi does not receive any remuneration and Mr Cellai did
not receive any remuneration to the date of his resignation. 16 The Character Group plc annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 August 2003
