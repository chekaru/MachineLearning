Directors' Remuneration Report
The Board presents the Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 August 2004.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of three independent non-executive directors, Lord Birdwood, Mr Fenn 
and Mr Harris. The policy of the Remuneration Committee is framed to give consideration to the provisions as 
to best practice set out in the Combined Code.
Remuneration of Directors
Each executive director is paid a basic salary and is entitled to benefits, namely payments of pension 
contributions to a suitable scheme of his choice, the option of the use of a company car, fuel and/or mileage 
allowance and participation in a private health care scheme.
Each of the executive directors is also entitled under the terms of his service contract to a bonus of an amount 
up to his basic salary in the event that specified performance targets are met or exceeded. These targets require 
increases in earnings per share in each financial year of the Group, adjusted to exclude certain exceptional non-
trading items.
The basic salaries referred to above are reviewed every year by the Remuneration Committee. The service 
contracts of the executive directors incorporate notice periods of 12 months.
These arrangements were originally agreed by the Board of Directors in May 1995, just prior to the flotation of 
the Company on the London Stock Exchange, in consultation with their legal and financial advisers and have 
recently been reviewed by the Remuneration Committee. In originally establishing these arrangements, and in 
the recent review, due account was taken of other listed companies of comparable size and business complexity, 
and in particular of the need to put in place incentive arrangements for each executive director which would 
be challenging and compatible with sustainable growth in shareholder value, whilst not being over-complicated 
or manipulable. The Board's policy on pension arrangements is to favour money purchase schemes rather than 
defined benefit (final salary ) schemes. 
The Company believes that share ownership by executive directors and senior executives strengthens the links 
between their personal interests and those of the shareholders. Executive directors holding less than 10% of 
the Company's issued share capital are eligible to participate in the Company's Inland Revenue approved 
executive share option scheme, details of which can be found in note 17 to the accounts. All executive directors 
are entitled to participate in the Company's unapproved executive share option scheme and in the Company's 
Enterprise Management Incentive Share Option Scheme, details of which may also be found in note 17 to the 
accounts.
The non-executive directors are appointed for a fixed term expiring at each Annual General Meeting of the 
Company, when they may offer themselves for re-election. Lord Birdwood, Mr Fenn, Mr Harris and Mr Horvat 
are each entitled to fees, currently at the rate of  20,000 per annum (2003:  20,000), plus expenses, without any 
right to compensation on early termination. Mr E Preziosi does not receive any remuneration.  16 The Character Group plc  annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 August 2004
