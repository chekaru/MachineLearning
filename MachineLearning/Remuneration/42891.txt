Directors' Remuneration Report
The Board presents the Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 August 2006.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of three independent non-executive directors: Lord Birdwood, Mr Fenn and
Mr Harris. The policy of the Remuneration Committee is framed to give consideration to the provisions as to best
practice set out in the Combined Code.
Remuneration of Directors
Each executive director is paid a basic salary and is entitled to benefits, namely payments of pension contributions
to a suitable scheme of his choice, the option of the use of a company car, fuel and/or mileage allowance and
participation in a private health care scheme.
Each of the executive directors is also entitled under the terms of his service contract to a bonus of an amount up
to his basic salary in the event that specified performance targets are met or exceeded. These targets require
increases in earnings per share in each financial year of the Group, adjusted to exclude certain exceptional non-
trading items. Mr Diver is also entitled to a further bonus of 2% of pre-tax profits in the event that a specified
target is met.
The basic salaries referred to above are reviewed every year by the Remuneration Committee. The service
contracts of the executive directors incorporate notice periods of 12 months.
These arrangements were originally agreed by the Board of directors in May 1995, just prior to the flotation of the
Company on the London Stock Exchange, in consultation with their legal and financial advisers and have recently
been reviewed by the Remuneration Committee. In originally establishing these arrangements, and in the recent
review, due account was taken of other quoted companies of comparable size and business complexity, and in
particular of the need to put in place incentive arrangements for each executive director which would be
challenging and compatible with sustainable growth in shareholder value, whilst not being over-complicated or
manipulable. The Board's policy on pension arrangements is to favour money purchase schemes rather than
defined benefit (final salary ) schemes.
The Company believes that share ownership by executive directors and senior executives strengthens the links
between their personal interests and those of the shareholders. All executive directors are entitled to participate in
the Company's unapproved executive Share Option Plan, details of which may also be found in note 16 to the
accounts.
The non-executive directors are appointed for a fixed term expiring at each Annual General Meeting of the
Company, when they may offer themselves for re-election. Lord Birdwood, Mr Fenn and Mr Harris are each
entitled to fees, currently at the rate of  20,000 per annum (2005:  20,000), plus expenses, without any right
to compensation on early termination. Mr MacKay did not receive any remuneration in the year ended
31 August 2006.
