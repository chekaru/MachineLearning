The Board presents the Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 August 2007.  
 
The Remuneration Committee  
The Remuneration Committee consists of three independent non-executive directors: Lord Birdwood, Mr Fenn and Mr Harris. 
The policy of the Remuneration Committee is framed to give consideration to the provisions as to best practice set out in the 
Combined Code.  
 
Remuneration of Directors  
Each executive director is paid a basic salary and is entitled to benefits, namely payments of pension contributions to a suitable 
scheme of his choice, the option of the use of a company car, fuel and/or mileage allowance and participation in a private health 
care scheme.  
 
Each of the executive directors is also entitled under the terms of his service contract to a bonus of an amount up to his basic 
salary in the event that specified performance targets are met or exceeded. These targets require increases in earnings per share in 
each financial year of the Group, adjusted to exclude certain exceptional non trading items. Mr Diver is also entitled to a further 
bonus of 2% of pre-tax profits in the event that a specified target is met.  
 
The basic salaries referred to above are reviewed every year by the Remuneration Committee. The service contracts of the 
executive directors incorporate notice periods of 12 months.  
 
These arrangements were originally agreed by the Board of directors in May 1995, just prior to the flotation of the Company on 
the London Stock Exchange, in consultation with their legal and financial advisers and have recently been reviewed by the 
Remuneration Committee. In originally establishing these arrangements, and in the recent review, due account was taken of other 
quoted companies of comparable size and business complexity and, in particular, of the need to put in place incentive 
arrangements for each executive director which would be challenging and compatible with sustainable growth in shareholder 
value, whilst not being over-complicated or manipulable. The Board's policy on pension arrangements is to favour money 
purchase schemes rather than defined benefit (final salary ) schemes.  
 
The Company believes that share ownership by executive directors and senior executives strengthens the links between their 
personal interests and those of the shareholders. All executive directors are entitled to participate in the Company's unapproved 
executive Share Option Plan, details of which may also be found in note 16 to the accounts.  
 
The non-executive directors are appointed for a fixed term expiring at each Annual General Meeting of the Company, when they 
may offer themselves for re-election. Each of the non-executive directors is entitled to fees, currently at the rate of  20,000 per 
annum (2006:  20,000), plus expenses, without any right to compensation on early termination.
