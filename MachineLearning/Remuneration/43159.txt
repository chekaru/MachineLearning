Remuneration Committee Report
The Remuneration Committee takes responsibility for 
setting and reviewing the remuneration of executive 
directors. At Charles Taylor we believe that the interests 
of shareholders and executive directors should be aligned 
as much as possible. The Committee seeks to achieve this 
by incentivising executive directors to deliver success 
over time through sustainable and profitable growth.
INTRODUCTION
Set out below is the report of the Remuneration Committee (the 
Committee) for the year to 31 December 2012.
The Committee has continued to apply restraint to executive 
directors' remuneration. There have been no base salary 
increases at the 1 January 2013 review date. This is the third year 
in which salaries have been frozen. 
Annual bonus awards have been made in respect of the 2012 
performance year to all executive directors. The Group Chief 
Executive Officer, David Marock received a cash bonus payment 
for 2012 performance of  275,000 (86% of base salary; 57% of 
maximum bonus). Three other executive directors received 
bonuses in respect of performance in 2012 of not more than 26% 
of base salary.   
The 2009 Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards that were due 
to vest in May 2012 did not meet the performance conditions, 
and therefore lapsed in full. The Committee made LTIP grants in 
2012 with face values of between 19% and 64% of base salary, 
which is below the maximum permitted under the Plan; these are 
due to vest in 2015 provided the performance conditions are met.
The Committee has made two significant changes to 
remuneration policy for 2013 on which major shareholders have 
been consulted:
 Two performance metrics will apply to the 2013 LTIP grants, to 
provide a more rounded view of performance. These are: TSR 
relative to the constituents of the FTSE Small Cap index, which 
was used in previous years as a single metric; and EPS growth 
relative to retail price inflation; and
 New shareholding requirements have been introduced. 
Executive directors are now expected to build up a holding of 
Charles Taylor shares of at least 1x base salary. Until they have 
met this holding level, they are required to invest a portion of 
annual bonus in shares, and any LTIP shares or deferred 
bonus shares that vest must be retained in full (net of tax).
We were pleased to announce in January 2013 the appointment 
of Tito Soso as Group Chief Financial Officer. We have included 
details of Tito's remuneration in this report. 
The Committee aims to ensure that remuneration policy for 
executives is: clear and simple; emphasises pay-for-performance 
over time; and, is closely aligned to the business strategy and the 
interests of shareholders.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) and Schedule 
8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the Regulations), and 
the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority. The report describes 
how the Board has applied the principles and complied with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code relating to 
Directors' remuneration. As required by the Companies Act, a 
resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting of the Company at which the financial 
statements will be approved. 
This report has been divided into separate sections for unaudited 
and audited information. The Companies Act requires the 
auditors to report to the Company's members on the auditable 
part  of this report and to state whether in their opinion that part 
of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration Committee
The Company's Remuneration Committee is constituted in 
accordance with the recommendations of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The members of the Committee during the 
year were Julian Avery (Chairman), Julian Cazalet, Gill Rider and 
David Watson, all independent non-executive directors, and 
Rupert Robson who is the Non-Executive Group Chairman. None 
of the Committee members has any personal financial interest 
(other than as shareholders), conflicts of interest arising from 
cross-Directorships, or day-to-day involvement in the running of 
the business. 
The Committee is responsible for developing policy on 
remuneration for executive directors and senior management, for 
determining specific remuneration packages for each of the 
executive directors, and recommending to the Board changes to 
the fees of the Non-Executive Group Chairman. The Chief 
Executive Officer may attend meetings by invitation. The 
Committee met seven times during 2012. No director plays a part 
in any discussion or decision about his or her own remuneration.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available at the 
Company's website.
New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Hewitt Ltd) is retained 
as the independent adviser to the Remuneration Committee. 
Committee effectiveness
The Committee conducted a review of its effectiveness taking 
both direct feedback and also the findings of the Board review 
conducted by the Senior Independent Director. The review 
concluded that the Committee had received sufficient, reliable 
and timely information from management to enable it to fulfil its 
responsibilities. Charles Taylor plc

Governance
Remuneration policy
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors and senior management of high calibre. The 
Committee reviews the packages offered annually. The Committee believes that the interests of shareholders and executive directors 
should be aligned as far as possible. It seeks to achieve this by incentivising executive directors to deliver success over time through 
sustainable and profitable growth. This includes the use of annual bonus awards linked to clear personal and departmental objectives 
and to the overall performance of the Company, and awards under the LTIP linked to longer-term, sustained company performance. 
The Committee aims to structure incentives to encourage the prudent management of levels of risk. 
The Remuneration Committee is mindful of the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG ) implications when designing and 
operating remuneration practices. The incentive structures aim to avoid any ESG risks and encourage responsible behaviour. The 
Committee also considers the pay and employment conditions of other employees in the Company and its subsidiaries, below the 
executive director level, when determining directors' remuneration. This includes considering the base salary review and bonus 
outcomes (if applicable) for other senior employees, when reviewing base salaries and determining any bonus awards for executive 
directors.
Application of policy
The main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors are as follows:
 base salary and benefits;
 annual bonus awards;
 longer-term incentive arrangements; and
 pension arrangements.
Base salary
Executive directors' base salaries are determined by the Committee each year and/or when an individual changes position or 
responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee is mindful of pay and employment conditions in the Company as a whole, 
the individual's experience and performance and current market rates.
Executive directors' base salaries are reviewed at the start of each financial year. The annual salaries of executive directors were not 
increased at 1 January 2013. This is the third year in which there have been no increases.

Joe Roach Executive director US$606,419 US$606,419
Tito Soso GCFO (appointed 16 January 2013)  235,000 Not applicable
In addition to their base salary and pension entitlements and benefits in cash, executive directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, in 
some cases a car or car allowance and private medical insurance. 
Annual bonus awards
The Group Chief Executive Officer, David Marock was awarded a cash bonus payment for 2012 performance of  275,000 (86% of 
base salary; 57% of maximum bonus). This bonus reflected significant achievements by David Marock in his first full year of office, 
when measured against his agreed set of objectives. In particular, considerable progress has been made in defining and implementing 
Group strategy, the reduction of Group debt, outstanding WIP and trade debtors, the launching of new offices, products and services, 
the delivery of a cost reduction and efficiency programme, the improved management of banking and investor relationships, the 
strengthening of major client relationships, and greatly improved succession planning, talent management and HR processes. Three 
other executive directors were awarded bonuses in respect of performance in 2012 of not more than 26% of base salary. These 
bonuses will be partly paid in cash and partly paid in deferred shares. These bonuses reflect the strong performances of each Director 
against his objectives, his contribution to the success and development of the Company in the year, and the Company's overall 
performance.
Under the annual bonus arrangement for 2013, the Remuneration Committee has approved a set of individual performance objectives 
for each executive director as part of the company's performance management process. These objectives are tailored to the roles of 
each executive and consist of both financial and non-financial goals, including profit growth and new business development. In 
addition, all executive directors have shared responsibility for the overall performance of the Company. In assessing the entitlement to 
any bonus and calculating the quantum of any such award, the Committee takes into account the performance of each executive 
director against his objectives, his contribution to the success and development of the Company in the year and the Company's overall 
performance. Charles Taylor plc

Remuneration Committee Report
continued
The maximum annual bonus for the Group Chief Executive Officer for 2013 performance is 150% of base salary, subject to the 
performance assessment as outlined above. However, if the bonus award is more than 100% of base salary, which can only be 
awarded for above on target performance, the portion above 100% of base salary will be delivered entirely in deferred Charles Taylor 
plc shares, which will be released in three equal tranches after one, two and three years.
The maximum annual bonus for the other executive directors for 2013 performance varies but does not exceed 100% of base salary, 
and is subject to the performance assessment as outlined above. However, if any of the executive directors earns a bonus of more than 
67% of their maximum bonus, the portion above 67% of the maximum will be delivered entirely in deferred Charles Taylor plc shares. 
These will be released in three equal tranches after one, two and three years.
Performance-related annual bonus awards are discretionary and are non-pensionable.
Minimum Shareholding Requirement
The Remuneration Committee has introduced a Minimum Shareholding Requirement (MSR) for the executive directors. Each executive 
director is required to build up and maintain a holding of Charles Taylor plc shares equivalent to 1x base salary. Until they have achieved 
this shareholding, they are required to retain 100% of any LTIP shares that vest, net of tax, and invest 25% of the value of any cash 
bonus in shares, net of tax.
Long-term incentive arrangements
Charles Taylor Long-Term Incentive Plan 2007 (LTIP )
The Committee awards performance shares under the LTIP to tie a proportion of remuneration to the Company's longer-term 
performance to further align the executive directors' interests with those of shareholders. 
Awards totalling 280,000 shares were made on 27 April 2012, equating to an award with a face value of between 19% and 64% of base 
salary for each of the executive directors at a share price of  1.3633 (2011:  1.54). Details of these awards are set out in the table 
below. The maximum award level permitted under the LTIP is 75% of base salary per annum. 
2012 Awards 2011 Awards
(number of 
shares)
(number of 
shares)
David Marock - GCEO 150,000 300,000
Damian Ely - GCOO 30,000 50,000
George Fitzsimons - GFD (resigned 31 October 2012) - 50,000
Alistair Groom - Executive director 50,000 50,000
Joe Roach - Executive director 50,000 50,000
Total 280,000 500,000
These awards are subject to a three-year performance period and are due to vest on 27 April 2015 (2011 awards vest 27 April 2014) 
subject to the Company's relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR ) performance. 
The proportion of shares which may be transferred under the LTIP will be determined by the Company's Total Shareholder Return 
(TSR) relative to the constituent companies of the FTSE Small Cap Index (the comparator Group ) in accordance with the following 
table:
Ranking of the Company against the comparator Group by reference to TSR Percentage of shares which may vest
Below median Nil
Median 25%
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata on a straight-line basis between 25% and 100%
Upper quartile 100%
Prior to the 2013 awards, LTIP awards have been subject only to relative TSR performance. From 2013 onwards LTIP grants will be 
subject to two performance metrics to give a more rounded view of Company performance:
Half of the award will be subject to Total Shareholder Return relative to the constituents of the FTSE Small Cap index, as shown in the 
table above.
The other half of the award will be subject to Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth relative to UK RPI (Retail Price Index) inflation. There will 
be zero vesting of this element if performance is below RPI+3 percentage points per annum, 25% vesting for RPI+3 percentage points 
per annum, and 100% vesting for RPI+9 percentage points per annum (linear interpolation between threshold and maximum). 
The maximum annual award size (in face value) under the LTIP remains at 75% of base salary, unless there are exceptional 
circumstances. Charles Taylor plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Governance
The Committee also has the discretion to make a downward adjustment (including to zero if appropriate) to the vesting outcome under 
either performance metric, if it considers that this is necessary to take account of its broader assessment of the performance of the 
Company.
Executive share options (ESOS)
No options were granted during the 2012 financial year, and none has been granted since 2006. Previous grants of options became 
exercisable only if the total earnings per ordinary share increased by at least the rate of increase Retail Price Index plus six percentage 
points per annum, over the three-year vesting period and, may be exercised up to ten years after the date of the award.
Save As You Earn (SAYE )
The Company also operates SAYE share option schemes for eligible employees under which options may be granted at a discount of 
up to 20% of market value. The value of options over shares that participants can be granted is capped, and is based on a monthly 
contribution to a savings account of a maximum of  250 per participant. The executive directors are eligible to participate in the SAYE 
share option scheme.
Details of the share plan awards granted and exercised are shown on page 36.
Appointment of Tito Soso as Group Chief Financial Officer 
Tito Soso was recruited externally and appointed Group Chief Financial Officer with effect from 16 January 2013. The remuneration 
package for Tito Soso is as follows:
Base salary  235,000
Pension contribution: 15%
Notice period from Company: 6 months
Maximum annual bonus: 100% of base salary
One-off Recruitment Award
1
73% of base salary (100,000 shares at  1.725) (16 Jan 2013)
Initial LTIP grant
2
110% of base salary (150,000 shares at  1.725) (16 Jan 2013)
1  The Remuneration Committee approved a special, one-off award under Listing Rule 9.4.2R(2) of the FSA Handbook to secure Tito's recruitment (the Recruitment Award ) 
into this key role in the Company. Further details are provided below.
2 The Committee also agreed that Tito's initial grant under the Charles Taylor LTIP should be 150,000 shares (110% of base salary at a share price of  1.725). The Plan Rules 
permit an award above the normal 75% of base salary limit in exceptional circumstances - these circumstances are detailed below in the section entitled Recruitment 
Award. The LTIP award is subject to the LTIP Rules and performance condition, and vests three years from the date of grant. This grant was made on 16 January 2013, 
and is in lieu of any grant of LTIP Tito would have been eligible for in the normal 2013 grant round.
Recruitment Award to Tito Soso
Tito Soso's earnings from his previous employment, and future potential earnings from alternative career opportunities available to him, 
were substantially higher than the standard remuneration package Charles Taylor plc was able to offer. To secure his appointment into 
this key role, it was necessary to grant Tito a Recruitment Award of 100,000 shares. The award made on 16 January 2013 has a value 
on the date of grant of  172,500 representing 73% of his base salary. The Recruitment Award was granted on similar terms to the 
Charles Taylor Long-Term Incentive Plan 2007 (the LTIP ), save that the LTIP performance condition does not apply to the Recruitment 
Award.
Other key features of the Recruitment Award are summarised below:
 It is non-pensionable. 
 It is due to vest on the third anniversary of the award date (16 January 2013), providing that Tito Soso remains in service at the 
vesting date and is not under notice of termination of employment (whether given or received) at the vesting date. 
 If Tito Soso leaves the Company as a good leaver or there is a Corporate Action  (as defined in the LTIP rules) before the date when 
the Recruitment Award would normally have vested, then the Recruitment Award will be subject to a pro rata adjustment based on 
the number of whole months which have elapsed from the award date to the date Tito Soso ceased employment with the Company 
as compared to 36 months.
 To the extent that the Recruitment Award vests, it will be satisfied with existing shares, excluding treasury shares. 
 The number of shares subject to the Recruitment Award may be adjusted in the event of any variation of share capital or a special 
dividend or similar event. 
 The Recruitment Award cannot be amended to the advantage of Tito Soso in relation to: (i) who can acquire shares under the 
Recruitment Award; (ii) the basis for determining his entitlement to, and the terms of, the shares and/or cash to be provided under 
the Recruitment Award; and (iii) any adjustment that may be made in respect of any variation of share capital or special dividend or 
similar event without prior shareholder approval in general meeting. However, this requirement does not apply to any minor 
alterations to benefit the administration of the Recruitment Award, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain 
favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment.  Charles Taylor plc

The terms of the Recruitment Award will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company from the date that the 
Notice of AGM is sent until the close of the AGM, and at the place of the AGM for at least 15 minutes before and during the meeting.
George Fitzsimons
George Fitzsimons ceased to be a director of Charles Taylor plc and his employment ended on 31 October 2012, when he stepped 
down from his role as Group Finance Director. He will receive  138,250 as compensation for loss of office, recognising his contractual 
entitlement to six months' notice from the Company. This amount is payable in instalments during the period of six months from the 
date his employment terminated. His share awards under the executive share plans lapsed without compensation on the date 
employment ended, and he has not received an annual bonus payment in respect of 2012 performance.
Dilution
The ABI guidelines permit the Company to issue options and awards of shares of up to 10% of the issued share capital on a ten-year 
rolling basis, of which 5% can be applied against discretionary schemes (LTIP and ESOS). As at 31 December 2012, there were 
1,557,530 shares available for such awards, of which 695,026 shares were available for discretionary schemes. The following table sets 
out the calculation:
All shares

(LTIP and ESOS)
Issued shares 40,347,605 40,347,605

Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance, measured by reference to total shareholder return, compared with the 
performance of the FTSE Small Cap Index, also measured by reference to total shareholder return.
The FTSE Small Cap Index has been selected for this comparison as it is the current index used to determine performance under the 
LTIP scheme for executive directors and is considered to be the most appropriate index measure.
Pension and other arrangements
All of the executive directors are in receipt of either a defined contribution to a money purchase pension scheme, or an equivalent cash 
allowance. The table below details the defined contribution and cash allowance arrangements for each executive director.

Directors' contracts of service, which include details of their remuneration, are available for inspection at the registered office of the 
Company during normal business hours and will be available for inspection at the AGM.
External appointments
Executive directors may be required to serve as directors on a number of external organisations directly related to the Group's business 
activities, as detailed on page 23; they receive no fees or additional remuneration for these appointments. To further develop their skills 
and experience, executive directors are permitted, subject to approval of the Board, to have up to one external non-executive 
directorship, unrelated to Charles Taylor, and are allowed to retain the fees earned in relation to this.
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors have individual letters of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board in accordance 
with the Articles of Association and based on surveys of the fees paid to non-executive directors of similar companies. With the 
exception of the Board Chairman who received a total fee of  75,000 per annum, the basic fee paid to each non-executive director in 
the year was  35,000 per annum. An additional  10,000 was paid to the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and 
 5,000 to the Senior Independent Director. The fees paid to the non-executive directors are reviewed, and any changes made, with 
effect from 1 January each year. The fees paid to the non-executive directors apart from the Board Chairman were not increased at 1 
January 2013. This is the third year in which there have been no increases. The Board Chairman's fee was increased to  90,000 from 1 
January 2013; this remains below the market median level for companies in the FTSE Small Cap index.
Non-executive directors cannot participate in any of the Company's annual bonus or share plans and are not eligible to join the 
Company's pension scheme.
