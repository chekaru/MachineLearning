Directors' Remuneration Report
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN -  
ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present the Remuneration 
Report for the year to 31 December 2013. There are a number of 
new requirements this year in relation to the content of the 
Remuneration Report following changes made to the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 (as amended) and the layout of this report 
reflects the new regulations and contains:
  the Directors' Remuneration Policy in relation to future 
payments to the directors and former directors; and
  the Annual Report on Remuneration, which sets out payments 
made in the financial year ending 31 December 2013.
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) takes responsibility 
for setting and reviewing the remuneration of executive directors. 
At Charles Taylor, we believe that the interests of shareholders and 
executive directors should be aligned as much as possible. The 
Committee seeks to achieve this by incentivising executive 
directors to deliver success over time through sustainable and 
profitable growth.
The Committee continues to apply restraint to executive directors' 
remuneration. The executive directors received a base salary 
increase of 3% each at the 1 January 2014 review date, which is 
their first increase for four years. 
We follow a rigorous process to set objectives and measure 
performance. Annual bonus awards have been made in respect of 
the 2013 performance year to all executive directors. Taking 
account of overall performance the Committee has awarded 
bonuses at the on-target level. The Group Chief Executive Officer, 
David Marock was awarded a cash bonus payment for 2013 
performance of  320,000 (100% of base salary; 66.6% of 
maximum bonus). The other executive directors were awarded 
bonuses in respect of performance in 2013 of not more than 67% 
of base salary; 66.6% of maximum bonus. These bonuses are 
primarily a reflection of excellent financial performance with 
year-on-year growth in Group adjusted PBT (+9.2%), Group 
adjusted EPS (+9.4%) and the Professional Services Operating 
profit (+11.9%). They also reflect significant achievements by the 
executive directors when measured against their agreed set of 
personal objectives, their contribution to the success and 
development of the Company in the year and the Company's 
overall performance. 
Of the existing Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards, the 2010 
LTIP awards for which the TSR performance period was 
completed and that were due to vest in April 2013 did not meet the 
TSR performance condition and therefore lapsed in full. The 
Committee made LTIP grants in 2013 subject to our stretching 
TSR and EPS performance targets; these are due to vest in 2016 
provided the performance conditions are met. Full details of how 
the Committee will operate the policy in 2014 are set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration. 
The Committee aims to ensure that the remuneration policy for 
executive directors is: clear and simple, emphasises pay-for-
performance over time; and is closely aligned to the business 
strategy and the interests of shareholders. I commend to you our 
Remuneration Policy and Annual Report on Remuneration.

DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION POLICY
This part of the Directors' Remuneration Report sets out the 
remuneration policy for the Company and has been prepared in 
accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
(as amended). The policy has been developed taking into account 
the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 and the 
views of major investors and describes the policy to be applied 
from 2014 onwards. The Director's Remuneration Policy will be put 
to a binding shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM and the policy will 
take formal effect as an approved policy for the purposes of 
section 226D(6)(b) of the Companies Act 2006 from that date.
Policy overview
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, 
motivate and retain directors and senior management of high 
calibre. The Remuneration Committee (the Committee  hereafter) 
believes that the interests of shareholders and executive directors 
should be aligned as far as possible. It seeks to achieve this by 
incentivising executive directors to deliver success over time 
through sustainable and profitable growth. This includes the use of 
annual bonus awards linked to clear personal and departmental 
objectives and to the overall performance of the Company, and 
awards under the LTIP linked to longer-term, sustained 
company performance. 
The Committee undertakes periodic external comparisons to 
examine current market trends and practices and equivalent roles 
in similar companies taking into account their size, business 
complexity, international scope and relative performance.
How the views of shareholders are taken into account
The Company values dialogue with its shareholders. The 
Committee considers investor feedback and the voting results 
received in relation to relevant AGM resolutions, each year. This is 
considered alongside any additional feedback on remuneration 
received from shareholders and/or shareholder representatives 
from time to time. If the Committee contemplates making any 
material changes to the remuneration policy outlined in this 
section, we will consult with major shareholders and/or their 
representative bodies before putting changes to the remuneration 
policy to shareholders. 
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last 
year's remuneration report are set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the 
Company
The pay and employment conditions of Charles Taylor employees 
are taken into account when setting executive remuneration policy. 
The Company does not formally consult with employees in respect 
of the design of the executive directors' remuneration policy. 
Remuneration policy for directors
There are three main elements of the remuneration package for 
executive directors:
1. Fixed pay, comprising base salary, pension scheme 
contributions and other benefits.
2. Annual performance-related remuneration, including deferral 
into shares.
3. Long-term performance-related remuneration in the form of 
share awards.
The table on the following page provides a summary of the key 
aspects of the remuneration policy for executive directors: Charles Taylor plc

Directors' Remuneration Report continued
Executive directors' remuneration policy
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Base salary To provide a core level 
of reward sufficient to 
attract, motivate and retain 
directors of high calibre, able 
to develop and execute the 
Company's strategy.
Executive directors' base salaries 
are reviewed at the end of each 
financial year and are determined 
by the Committee taking account 
of base salaries and base salary 
increases in the Company as a 
whole, the individual's experience 
and performance, and current 
market rates.
Periodic reference is also 
made to median levels amongst 
relevant FTSE and industry 
comparators of similar size 
and scope.
The Committee considers the 
impact of any basic salary 
increase on the total 
remuneration package. 
Directors' salaries (and other 
elements of the remuneration 
package) may be paid in different 
currencies as appropriate to 
reflect their geographic location.
The Committee is guided by 
the general increase for the 
broader employee population, 
but on occasions may need to 
recognise, for example, 
development in role, change 
in position or responsibility, 
and market levels. For this 
reason the Committee does 
not feel it is appropriate to set 
a maximum salary as this 
would limit its ability to 
respond to market conditions 
and could set expectations of 
salary levels for future 
appointments. 
Salary levels may be changed 
from time to time by the 
Committee within this policy. 
Current salaries are set out 
in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
Benefits To provide cost-effective and 
market-competitive benefits to 
support the well-being 
of directors.
Executive directors receive 
certain benefits-in-kind such as 
a car or car allowance, private 
medical insurance and other 
insurance benefits. 
Other ancillary benefits may be 
provided, including relocation 
assistance (as required).
Benefits constitute only a 
small percentage of total 
remuneration and the value is 
not subject to a specific cap. 
The benefits provided may be 
subject to minor amendment 
from time to time by the 
Committee within this policy.
Pension To provide directors with a 
market competitive pension/
long-term savings option to 
assist with recruitment 
and retention.
A defined contribution to a 
money purchase pension 
scheme is provided, or an 
equivalent cash allowance. 
Any employer contribution is 
limited to maximum of 15% of 
base salary.
This is reviewed periodically 
by the Committee and may be 
subject to minor change 
within the policy. Charles Taylor plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Annual bonus To tie a proportion of 
remuneration to the 
Company's annual 
performance.
Compulsory partial deferral 
serves further to align the 
executive directors' interests 
with those of shareholders.
Each executive's annual bonus is 
determined based on group, 
divisional/functional and personal 
financial and non-financial goals. 
The main emphasis is on financial 
objectives. 
Where a bonus award is above a 
certain size, a proportion will be 
delivered in deferred Company 
shares which will be released in 
three equal tranches after one, 
two and three years.
For awards in respect of 2014, 
where a bonus award exceeds 
the on-target level, the portion 
above the on-target level will be 
deferred as described above.
Annual bonus awards are 
non-pensionable.
With effect from the 2014 bonus 
award year and onwards, there is 
a claw-back provision in place. 
This allows the Committee to 
seek to recoup paid and deferred 
bonus in exceptional 
circumstances.
Summary details of the 
performance targets set for the 
year under review and 
performance against them is 
provided in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration to the degree 
these are not commercially 
sensitive. 
The policy maximum is 150% 
of base salary for excellent 
performance, although the 
Committee may set individual 
limits on bonus that are below 
this policy maximum taking 
account of individuals' roles.
For on-target performance the 
bonus opportunity is usually 
limited to no more than 
two-thirds of the maximum.
Participants may be eligible to 
receive a payment in either 
cash or shares, following 
vesting, representing the 
dividends that have accrued 
during the vesting period. Charles Taylor plc

Governance
Directors' Remuneration Report continued
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Long-term incentive plan 
2007 (LTIP)
To tie a proportion of 
remuneration to the Company's 
longer-term performance to 
further align the executive 
directors' interests with those of 
shareholders.
Annual awards of performance 
shares or nil-cost options are 
made. These awards are subject 
to a three-year service and 
performance period.
The Committee sets performance 
conditions taking account of the 
business strategy. From 2013 
onwards LTIP grants are currently 
subject to two performance 
metrics, to give a more rounded 
view of Company performance:
Half of the award is currently 
subject to Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) relative to the 
constituents of a relevant 
comparator index or peer group 
and the other half of the award is 
currently subject to Earnings Per 
Share (EPS) growth. The 
Committee has authority to 
change the metrics for future 
awards, which will be subject to 
consultation in advance with major 
shareholders for material changes.
The Committee has the discretion 
to make a downward adjustment 
(including to zero if appropriate) to 
the vesting outcome under the 
performance metrics, if it 
considers that this is necessary to 
take account of its broader 
assessment of the performance of 
the Company.
With effect from awards in respect 
of the 2014 financial year and 
onwards, there is a claw-back 
provision in place. This allows the 
Committee to seek to recoup LTIP 
awards in exceptional 
circumstances.
The normal maximum annual 
award size (in face value) under 
the LTIP is 75% of base salary. 
The plan rules permit higher 
awards in exceptional 
circumstances. The Committee 
does not expect that any 
individual award would exceed 
125% of base salary.
For threshold performance, 25% 
of the award will vest, increasing 
on a straight line basis up to 
100% of the award for maximum 
performance.
Participants in the LTIP may be 
eligible to receive a payment in 
either cash or shares, following 
vesting representing the 
dividends that they would have 
accrued on the vested shares in 
the vesting period.
All employee share schemes To encourage employee share 
participation.
The Company may from time to 
time operate tax-approved share 
plans (such as HMRC-approved 
Save As You Earn scheme) for 
which executive directors could 
be eligible.
The schemes are subject to the 
limits set by tax authorities. Charles Taylor plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Minimum shareholding 
requirement (MSR)
To further align executive 
directors' interests with 
shareholders.
Each executive director will be 
required to build up and maintain a 
holding of Company shares 
equivalent to a multiple of base 
salary, as determined by the 
Committee.
Until an executive director has built 
up such a shareholding, they are 
required to retain 100% of any LTIP 
shares that vest, net of tax, and 
invest at least 25% of the value of 
any cash bonus in shares, net 
of tax.
N/A
Discretions retained by the Committee in operating the incentive plans
In operating the annual bonus plan and LTIP, the Committee will adhere to the respective plan rules and the Listing Rules where relevant. 
There are several areas with regards to the operation and administration of these plans for which the Committee will retain discretion. 
Consistent with market practice, these include (but are not limited to) the following:
  Selecting the participants;
  The timing of grant and/or payment;
  The size of grants and/or payments (within the limits set out in the policy table above);
  The extent of vesting based on the assessment of performance;
  Determination of a good leaver and where relevant the extent of vesting in the case of the share based plans;
  Treatment in exceptional circumstances such as a change of control, in which the Committee would act in the best interests of the 
Company and its shareholders;
  Making the appropriate adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring events, variation of 
capital and special dividends); 
  Cash settling awards; and
  The annual review of performance measures, weightings and setting targets for the annual bonus and discretionary share plans from 
year to year.
Any performance conditions may be amended or substituted if one or more events occur which cause the Committee to reasonably 
consider that the performance conditions would not without alteration achieve its original purpose. Any varied performance condition 
would not be materially less difficult to satisfy.
Choice of performance measures and approach to target setting
The performance metrics that are used for our annual bonus and long-term incentive plans are chosen to reflect the Group's key 
performance indicators and strategic aims. Performance objectives are designed to encourage continuous improvement and incentivise 
the delivery of stretch performance. A small percentage of the total opportunity is available for delivering threshold performance levels 
with maximum outcomes requiring exceptional performance.
Annual bonus
In determining any bonus award, the Committee takes into account the performance of each executive director against his objectives, his 
contribution to the success and development of the Company in the year and the Company's overall performance. The measures and 
criteria set may vary from year to year as appropriate to reflect the changing needs of the business.
LTIP 
The LTIP is currently based on EPS and TSR performance. Growth in EPS is a measure of the Company's overall financial success and 
closely aligns the executives' interests with those of our shareholders. TSR provides an external assessment of the Company's 
performance and captures the total return created for shareholders. Charles Taylor plc
40
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Governance
A sliding scale of targets is set for each measure that take account of corporate plans and external market expectations for the Company. 
The Committee will review the appropriateness of the performance targets prior to each LTIP grant. The Committee reserves the 
discretion within this policy to set different measures and targets for future awards, providing that, in the opinion of the Committee, the 
new targets are no less challenging and are appropriate to the strategy in light of the circumstances at the time than those used 
previously. Should there be a material change in the Company's performance conditions (e.g. introducing an additional or alternative 
performance metric) appropriate consultation with the Company's major shareholders would take place in advance along with a full 
explanation in the Annual Report on Remuneration to support any such change. The measures and targets for awards granted under this 
remuneration policy are set out for shareholder approval in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
All-employee schemes
No performance targets are set for awards under tax-approved share plans as these are non-discretionary plans designed for all 
employees. Any such plans are designed to encourage employees across the Group to purchase Company shares and applying 
performance targets to these awards would materially reduce the effect in this regard.
Differences in remuneration policy for executive directors compared to other employees
The remuneration policy for the executive directors is designed having regard to the pay and employment conditions of other employees 
in the Company and its subsidiaries. 
There are some differences in the structure of the remuneration policy for the executive directors (as set out above) compared to that for 
other employees within the organisation, which the Committee believes are necessary to reflect the differing levels of seniority and 
responsibility. The remuneration policy for the executive directors places a greater weight on performance-based variable pay through the 
long-term incentive scheme. This ensures the remuneration of the executives is aligned with both the long-term performance of the 
Company and therefore the interests of shareholders.
External non-executive director positions
Executive directors may be required to serve as directors on a number of external organisations directly related to the Group's business 
activities; they receive no fees or additional remuneration for these appointments. 
To further develop their skills and experience, executive directors are permitted, subject to approval of the Board, to have normally no 
more than one external non-executive directorship, unrelated to Charles Taylor, and are allowed to retain the fees earned in relation 
to this.
Details of external directorships held by the executive directors and any fees that they received are provided in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
Approach to new executive director appointments
The remuneration package for a new executive director will be set in accordance with the Company's approved remuneration policy as 
set out in this report, subject to the points below.
The base salary level of a newly appointed executive will be set taking into account the individual's experience and the nature of the role 
being offered. Dependent on the previous experience of the individual appointed, base salary may be initially positioned below the 
relevant market rate for the role and increased as the individual gains in relevant experience subject to their individual performance.
In the case of an external hire, the Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements when it considers these to be in 
the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, to compensate for remuneration foregone by the individual in order to take up the 
role. This includes the use of awards made under 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules. Such awards would take account of the form (cash or shares) 
and time horizons attaching to remuneration foregone and the impact of any performance conditions.
For an internal appointment, any outstanding variable pay awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out according to 
its terms of grant and the appointee will become subject to the minimum shareholding requirements policy on their appointment as an 
executive director.
Service contracts and payments for loss of office
All the executive directors have entered into service agreements with the Company, requiring notice of termination to be given by either 
party. It is the Company's policy that the period of notice for executive directors will not exceed 12 months.
Directors' Remuneration Report continued Charles Taylor plc
41
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
A director's service contract may be terminated without notice and without any further payment or compensation, except for sums 
accrued up to the date of termination, in the event of gross misconduct. If the Company terminates the employment of an executive 
director in other circumstances, compensation is limited to base salary due for any unexpired notice period, plus an amount in respect of 
contractual benefits and pension which would have been received during the unexpired notice period. In the event of a change of control 
of the Company there is no enhancement to contractual terms. 
Directors' contracts of service and letters of appointment, which include details of their remuneration, are available for inspection at the 
registered office of the Company during normal business hours and will be available for inspection at the AGM.

In addition, any statutory entitlements in connection with the termination would be paid

Remuneration entitlements An annual bonus may also become payable subject to performance, for the period of active 
service only. Outstanding share awards will vest in accordance with the provisions of the 
various scheme rules - see below.
In all cases, performance targets would apply to annual bonus and/or LTIP awards.
Change of control There are no enhanced terms in the contracts in relation to termination following a change 
of control. However, under the relevant plan rules, there is scope for accelerated vesting of 
any share awards.
*  Alistair Groom stepped down from the Board on 28 February 2014.
If an executive director leaves employment, any outstanding share awards will be treated in accordance with the relevant plan rules. 
Normally, any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment. However if an executive director ceases employment with the 
Group as a  good leaver' as defined in the various scheme rules or in the event of a takeover, any outstanding share awards will vest in 
accordance with those rules. In the case of the LTIP awards, vesting is normally subject to a performance condition, with a pro-rata 
reduction in the size of the award to reflect the period of time that the award has been held. Any remainder of the awards will lapse.
Under the bonus plan, the deferred shares for a good leaver will immediately vest in full and if the award is in the form of an option, there 
is a 12-month window in which the award can be exercised.
In determining whether an executive should be treated as a good leaver or not, the Committee will take into account the performance of 
the individual and the reasons for their departure.
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with 
current or former directors (such as the payment of a pension or the unwinding of legacy share schemes) that have been disclosed to 
shareholders in previous Directors' Remuneration Reports. This includes, for example, the recruitment awards made to both David 
Marock and Tito Soso.
Reward scenarios
Under the Company's remuneration policy, a significant portion of the remuneration received by executive directors is dependent on 
Company performance. The chart below illustrates how the total pay opportunities for the executive directors vary under three different 
performance scenarios: fixed pay only (minimum), on-target performance and maximum performance. The chart is only indicative, as the 
effect of share price movements and dividend accrual have been excluded. All the assumptions used are noted below the chart.  Charles Taylor plc

  Target = 67% of the annual bonus and 25% of the LTIP awards vesting
  Maximum = 100% of the annual bonus and LTIP awards vesting 
Base salary levels are based on those to applying on 1 January 2014. The value of taxable benefits is based on the cost of supplying 
those benefits (as disclosed) for the year ending 31 December 2013. The remuneration of Joe Roach has been converted from US dollars 
into pounds using the 2013 year average exchange rate of 0.637165. 
The on-target bonus potential used for David Marock, Tito Soso, Damian Ely and Joe Roach is 100%, 67%, 35% and 27.5% of base salary 
respectively. The maximum bonus potential used for David Marock, Tito Soso, Damian Ely and Joe Roach is 150%, 100%, 52.5% and 
41.25% of base salary respectively. The LTIP awards used for David Marock is 75% of base salary. Whilst under this policy awards can be 
higher, the customary award sizes used for Tito Soso, Damian Ely and Joe Roach are 50%, 50% and 31% of base salary respectively. 
The executive directors may participate in all-employee share schemes on the same basis as other employees. The value that may be 
received under these schemes is subject to tax approved limits. For simplicity, the value that may be received from participating in these 
schemes has been excluded from the above charts. 
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors have individual letters of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board in accordance with 
the Articles of Association.

Non-executive directors' fees policy
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Non-executive director fees To attract and retain a high- 
calibre chairman and non-
executive directors by offering 
market competitive fee levels. 
The Chairman is paid a single  
fee for all his responsibilities.  
The Non-executives are paid a 
basic fee. The Chairmen of the 
Board Committees and the  
Senior Independent Director are 
paid an additional fee to reflect 
their extra responsibilities.
The level of these fees is  
reviewed periodically by the 
Committee and Chief Executive 
for the Chairman and by the 
Chairman and Executive  
Directors for the Non-executive 
Directors, with reference to  
market levels in comparably  
sized FTSE companies, and a 
recommendation is then made  
to the Board. The Non-executive 
Directors have the option to 
forego their fees in exchange for 
shares in the Company. 
Non-executive directors cannot 
participate in any of the 
Company's annual bonus or  
share plans and are not eligible  
for any pension entitlements  
from the Company.
The Committee is guided in 
considering any increase in fees 
by reference to current market 
levels but on occasions may need 
to recognise, for example, 
changes in responsibility and/or 
time commitments.
For the appointment of a new chairman or non-executive director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved 
remuneration policy in force at that time.
All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with the Company and are subject to annual re-election at the AGM. The 
appointment letters for the Chairman and non-executive directors provide that no compensation is payable on termination, other than 
accrued fees and expenses. Charles Taylor plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
The figures in the single figure table are derived from the following:
Total salary and fees The amount of salary fees received in the year.
Taxable benefits The taxable value of benefits received in the year. These are car allowance, private medical 
insurance, life assurance, permanent health insurance and subscriptions.
Annual bonus Annual bonus that was earned in the year and can be split between cash and shares. Shares 
awarded will be released in three equal tranches after one, two and three years. This includes 
 18,000,  24,000 and  34,000 of the bonuses received by Damian Ely, Alistair Groom and Joe 
Roach for 2012.
Long-term incentives The value of LTIP awards that vest in respect of a performance period that is completed by the end 
of the relevant financial year. For 2013 this includes the 2010 LTIP award under which none has 
vested. For 2012 this includes the 2009 LTIP award under which none has vested.
Pension related benefits The pension figure represents the cash value of pension contributions received by the executive 
directors. 
Other Other includes the value of SAYE options vesting in the financial year.
Annual bonus for the year ending 31 December 2013 UK
At the start of each financial year the Remuneration Committee sets the bonus opportunity for the year and reviews and challenges the 
performance objectives for each executive director. They are predominately financial as exemplified below but also include some specific 
operational, people and client related objectives which are personal to the executives. The Committee challenges to ensure they are 
consistent with the strategy, budget and sufficiently stretching. The Group Chief Executive Officer and individual directors agree the 
objectives and all the objectives are shared in the executive team to ensure the team works collectively.
For 2013, the bonus opportunities for the executive directors were as follows:
On-target  
% of salary
Maximum  
% of salary
David Marock 100% 150%
Damian Ely 25% 37.5%
Alistair Groom 30% 45%
Joe Roach 25% 37.5%
Tito Soso 67% 100%
At the end of the year, the Group Chief Executive Officer and individual directors review the performance against the objectives. 
Quantifiable measures are used wherever possible. The Committee assesses the performance of the Company, each business and 
support service team and the individual and determines the performance level achieved. On-target performance is considered to be the 
achievement of objectives and in particular key financial objectives. Exceptional business performance would be required to achieve 
maximum performance. 
Given overall Group adjusted profits are 9.2% ahead of the prior year (which is slightly ahead of budget), the starting point for our 
discussions was on-target bonuses, with adjustments up or down depending on progress on other objectives. Charles Taylor plc

Adjusted PBT (attributable to owners of the Company)  9.1m  10.0m 9.2%
Adjusted EPS 18.33p 20.05p 9.4%
Examples of the personal objectives which relate to business, people and clients include: 
  Strive to deliver strong financial performance for mutual clients while maintaining client servicing and satisfaction levels.
  Create new business products and services to generate specified amounts of revenue and profit. 
  Ensure top team firmly established and operating effectively and that succession planning is well underway for key senior staff across 
the Group.
  Attract, retain and develop top talent within each business.
  Develop and gain buy-in for a co-ordinated group-wide marketing, public relations, business development and sales approach 
and culture.
  Ensure restructuring plans are agreed and drive delivery within the agreed timeframes of cost cutting targets.
  Drive down debt ratios through improved working capital and active management of the insurers in run-off business. 
Performance for some of these criteria was well ahead of target. However, looking at performance overall, the executive directors were 
judged to have achieved on-target performance.
The resulting bonuses for 2013 were as follows:

Vesting of LTIP awards
The LTIP awards granted on 29 April 2010 were based on performance to 28 April 2013 to vest 29 April 2013. As disclosed in previous 
annual reports, the performance condition for these awards measured the Company's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to the 
constituent companies of the FTSE Small Cap Index in accordance with the following table:
Ranking of the Company against the comparator 
Group by reference to TSR Percentage of shares which may vest
Below median Nil
Median 25%
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata on a straight-line basis between 25% and 100%
Upper quartile 100%
For this 2010 award, Charles Taylor's rank was below the median rank and accordingly no awards vested.

LTIP awards made in 2013
LTIP awards totalling 270,000 shares were made on 23 April 2013 at a share price of  1.69 (the middle market quotation share price prior 
to the gate of grant). As reported last year, on 16 January 2013, the Committee awarded Tito Soso an initial grant under the LTIP of 
150,000 shares and a one-off award of 100,000 shares under Listing Rule 9.4.2R(2) of the FCA Handbook, both at a share price 
of  1.725. 
Details of these awards are set out in the table below. The maximum award level permitted under the LTIP is 75% of base salary per 
annum, however, the Plan Rules permit an award above the normal 75% of base salary limit in exceptional circumstances (although the 
Committee does not expect that any individual award would exceed 125% of base salary).

1 The Tito Soso LTIP award is subject to the LTIP Rules and the TSR performance condition, and vests three years from the date of grant. This grant took into account any grant 
of a LTIP award Tito Soso would have been eligible for in the normal 2013 LTIP grant round.
2 The Recruitment Award was granted on similar terms to the LTIP, save that the LTIP performance condition does not apply to the Recruitment Award.
The April awards are subject to a three-year performance period ending 31 December 2015 and are due to vest on 23 April 2016. The 
proportion of shares which may be transferred under the LTIP will be determined by two performance metrics. Half of the award will be 
subject to the Company's TSR relative to the constituent companies of the FTSE Small Cap Index in accordance with the following table:
Ranking of the Company against the comparator 
Group by reference to TSR Percentage of shares which may vest
Below median Nil
Median 25%
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata on a straight-line basis between 25% and 100%
Upper quartile 100%
The other half of the award will be subject to Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth relative to UK RPI (Retail Price Index) inflation. There will be 
zero vesting of this element if performance is below RPI+3 percentage points per annum, 25% vesting for RPI+3 percentage points per 
annum, and 100% vesting for RPI+9 percentage points per annum (linear interpolation between threshold and maximum). 
The Committee also has the discretion to make a downward adjustment (including to zero if appropriate) to the vesting outcome under 
either performance metric, if it considers that this is necessary to take account of its broader assessment of the performance of 
the Company. Charles Taylor plc

Directors' interests and Minimum Shareholding Requirement (MSR)
There is a MSR for the executive directors. Each executive director is required to build up and maintain a holding of Charles Taylor plc 
shares equivalent in value to 1x base salary. Until they have achieved this shareholding, they are required to retain 100% of any LTIP 
shares that vest, net of tax, and invest 25% of the value of any cash bonus in shares, net of tax.

Executive share options (ESOS)
No options were granted during the 2013 financial year, and none have been granted since 2006. Previous grants of options became 
exercisable only if the total earnings per ordinary share increased by at least the rate of increase of the Retail Price Index plus 6 
percentage points per annum, over the three-year vesting period and may be exercised up to ten years after the date of the award. 
The executive directors are no longer permitted to participate in the ESOS.
Save As You Earn (SAYE)
The Company also operates SAYE share option schemes for eligible employees, under which options may be granted at a discount of 
up to 20% of market value. The value of options over shares that participants can be granted is capped, and is based on a monthly 
contribution to a savings account of a maximum of  250 per participant. The executive directors are eligible to participate in the SAYE 
share option scheme.
The Company's shares were trading at  2.52 at the year-end (2012:  1.69) and traded in the range  1.65 to  2.6825 throughout the year.
Pension and other arrangements
With effect from 1 July 2011, defined benefit pension accrual for future service ceased for any of the executive directors. All of the 
executive directors are now in receipt of either a defined contribution to a money purchase pension scheme, or an equivalent cash 
allowance. The table below details the defined contribution and cash allowance arrangements for each executive director.

The decreases in transfer values in 2013 were principally due to the impact of the rise in yields on gilts and bonds. The normal retirement

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration principles
The Committee believes that the interests of shareholders and executive directors should be aligned, as far as possible. It seeks to 
achieve this by incentivising executive directors to deliver success over time through sustainable and profitable growth. 
Remuneration Committee
The Company's Remuneration Committee is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. The members of the Committee during the year were Julian Avery (Chairman), Julian Cazalet, Gill Rider and David Watson, all 
independent non-executive directors, and Rupert Robson who is the Non-Executive Group Chairman. Gill Rider took over as Chairman of 
the Committee on the retirement of Julian Avery on 31 December 2013. Edward Creasy joined the Committee on his appointment as a 
director on 1 January 2014. None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of 
interest arising from cross-directorships, or day-to-day involvement in the running of the business. 
The Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for the executive directors and senior management, for determining 
specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors, and recommending to the Board changes to the fees of the Non-
Executive Group Chairman. The Group Chief Executive Officer may attend meetings by invitation. The Committee met six times during 
2013. No executive director plays a part in any discussion or decision about his or her own remuneration.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Company's website at www.ctplc.com under the Investor section - 
Corporate Governance or from the Company Secretariat department.
Committee effectiveness
The Committee conducted a review of its effectiveness taking both direct feedback and also the findings of the Board review conducted 
by the Senior Independent Director. The review concluded that the Committee had received sufficient, reliable and timely information to 
enable it to fulfil its responsibilities.
Advisers
New Bridge Street, (NBS), a trading name of Aon Hewitt Ltd, is retained as the adviser to the Remuneration Committee. NBS was 
appointed by the Committee to provide advice and information and is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants' Code of Conduct 
which requires that its advice be objective and impartial. NBS has not provided other services to the Company during the financial year.
New Bridge Street's fees for providing advice and information related to remuneration and employee share plans to the Committee 
amounted to  49,397.
In addition to New Bridge Street, the following people provided material advice or services to the Committee during the year:
David Marock Group Chief Executive Officer

External appointments
As detailed in the Remuneration Policy, to further develop their skills and experience, executive directors are permitted, subject to 
approval of the Board, to have up to one external non-executive directorship, unrelated to Charles Taylor, and are allowed to retain the 
fees earned in relation to this. No executive directors had an external directorship unrelated to Charles Taylor during the year under 
review, other than Tito Soso who was a director of Ceme SpA on his appointment, but resigned on 3 July 2013.
Dilution
The ABI guidelines permit the Company to issue options and awards of shares of up to 10% of the issued share capital on a ten-year 
rolling basis, of which 5% can be applied against discretionary schemes (LTIP and ESOS). As at 31 December 2013, there were 1,422,258 
shares available for such awards, of which 614,793 shares were available for discretionary schemes. The following table sets out

Annual bonus awards
Under the annual bonus arrangement for 2014, the Committee has approved the opportunities and a set of individual performance 
objectives for each executive director as part of the Company's performance management process. These objectives are tailored to the 
roles of each executive and consist of both financial and non-financial goals. They are predominately financial but also include some 
specific operational, people and client related objectives which are personal to the executives. The Committee believes these objectives 
to be commercially sensitive and has chosen not to disclose them in advance. Retrospective disclosure will be provided in next year's 
Annual Report on Remuneration. Charles Taylor plc

Damian Ely and Tito Soso and 31% of base salary for Joe Roach. These awards will be subject to two performance metrics. Half of the

Index (the comparator group) in accordance with the following table:

vesting of this element if performance is below RPI+3 percentage points per annum, 25% vesting for RPI+3 percentage points per 
annum, and 100% vesting for RPI+9 percentage points per annum (linear interpolation between threshold and maximum).
