 REMUNERATION REPORT 49
CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008
The Directors present the Remuneration report for the year
ended 31 December 2008. The report describes how the
Company has applied the principles of the Combined Code
with regard to remuneration. Sections 3(iv-viii) and 3(b) and the
notes to the Remuneration report on pages 53 to 55 are subject
to audit.
1 The Remuneration Committee
The Board has delegated authority to the Remuneration Committee
( the Committee') to review the remuneration trends across the
Company and its major businesses and to determine the
remuneration and other terms and conditions of the Executive
Directors, the Chairman, the Company Secretary and the Key
Management of the Company. The Committee is also
responsible for reviewing the remuneration of those individuals
identified as senior management by the Board of the Company.
The members of the Committee are the Hon. James Bruce
(Chairman), Lars Emilson, John Biles, Grey Denham and 
Andrew Osborne. There were no changes to the membership 
of the Committee of Charter plc between 1 January 2008 and 
22 October 2008 or to that of the Company since 22 October
2008 when the Scheme became effective. All members of the
Committee are deemed independent in accordance with the
Combined Code. Details of the number of meetings held by 
the Committee since 22 October 2008, as well as attendance
details, can be found in the table contained in the Corporate
Governance Report on page 44. The terms of reference 
of the Committee are available upon request from the 
Company Secretary and are on the Company's website at
www.charter.ie. The Committee had access to the advice of the
Chief Executive and the Company Secretary (neither of whom
participated in any discussion directly relating to their own
remuneration) and a number of external advisers in conducting
its duties. The Committee consulted the following: Hewitt
Associates, who provided the Company with actuarial advice in
relation to pensions and Hewitt New Bridge Street Consultants
( HNBS', part of Hewitt Associates), who were appointed to
advise the Committee and provided independent advice
regarding Executive Directors' remuneration and long-term
incentive arrangements (but no further services to the Company).
2 Remuneration policy
The policy for Executive Directors and Key Management is
designed to enable the Company to attract, motivate and retain
individuals by ensuring that their total reward is competitive and
linked to both individual and business performance. Consistent
with this policy, the remuneration of the Executive Directors 
is intended to be competitive and comprise both fixed and
performance-related elements. Performance-related elements
are designed to form a significant part of potential remuneration.
Executive Directors' remuneration is reviewed each year to
ensure that it is supportive of both the Company's business
objectives and the creation of shareholder value. It is the
intention of the Committee that there should be long-term
incentive plans for Executive Directors whereby they are
rewarded with interests in the Company's shares for sustained
performance over a period of time. The remuneration packages
for other Key Management are designed to operate on a basis
similar to that of the Executive Directors.
When setting remuneration levels for the Executive Directors
and Key Management, the Committee gives regard to general
pay policies across the Company as a whole as well as the
wider market, in order to ensure that a coherent policy applies. 
3 Remuneration
(a) Executive Directors
(i) Base salary
The base salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed
annually and following exceptional one-off events where the
individual responsibilities of the Executive Director change
significantly. Salaries are benchmarked against those paid 
to directors in companies in comparable sectors which are 
of a similar size and international complexity.
The base salaries of the Executive Directors were reviewed 
with effect from 1 January 2009 and a pay increase of 3 per cent 
was awarded. These increases were made taking into account
the Executive Directors' relative benchmark positioning and
were consistent with the average increase across the rest of 
the Company.
(ii) Bonus
The maximum bonus potential of the Executive Directors 
is 100 per cent of salary. For the achievement of target
performance in 2008, a bonus of 50 per cent of salary and in
2009 40 per cent of salary may be earned. 
In 2008, actual bonus payouts were assessed depending on 
the achievement of a number of corporate and individual targets
as discussed below. In order to align the interests of Directors
with those of the Company's shareholders, it is the Company's
policy that bonuses are only payable for the achievement of
stretching performance targets, the majority of which are linked
to Company financial performance. For the year ended 
31 December 2008, these targets were as follows:
1 64 per cent of bonus: EPS performance relative to budget;
2 16 per cent of bonus: Cash flow performance relative to
budget; and
3 20 per cent of bonus: Personal performance.
For targets 1 and 2, 50 per cent of the maximum bonus on 
each part would be payable for meeting budget, the maximum 
bonus would only become payable for performance that was
substantially in excess of budget and no bonus would be
payable for performance that was substantially below budget.
The Committee has reserved the overriding discretion to review
aggregate bonus levels payable to Executive Directors based 
on the above criteria to ensure that they are appropriate taking
into account the overall financial performance of the Company
and its performance relative to the market. No bonuses payable
to Executive Directors are pensionable. 
Following a review of the Executive Directors' performance
during the year ended 31 December 2008, the Committee
determined that the budgeted EPS target had been exceeded
but that the cash flow target had not been achieved.
Accordingly, no bonus payment was made in respect of the
cash flow target. Details of the bonuses paid to the Executive
Directors in respect of the year ended 31 December 2008 
are set out on page 53.
In respect of the year ending 31 December 2009, bonuses
payable to the Executive Directors will be measured against 
the same performance objectives as those used in determining
the 2008 bonus entitlements, save that, in respect of the EPS
target, 40 per cent of the maximum bonus for that part would 
be payable for meeting budget, the maximum bonus would 
only become payable for performance that was substantially 
in excess of budget and no bonus would be payable for
performance that was marginally below budget. 
DIRECTORS' AND OTHER REPORTS From 2009, the Committee has agreed that performance under
the EPS element of the bonus will be measured on a constant
currency basis. To date, performance had been measured using
actual rates of exchange. However, the Committee believes that
the revised approach will be a better reflection of management's
underlying performance since exchange rates are not within
management's control. 
(iii) Deferred Bonus Plan ( DBP')
One-quarter of any bonus paid to Executive Directors (i.e. up 
to 25 per cent of salary) will be paid in shares acquired in the
market and compulsorily deferred for three years under the DBP . 
If Executive Directors leave voluntarily or for cause during this
deferral period, their awards will normally lapse. These shares
are held in trust prior to their release on vesting following the
expiration of the three-year deferral period.
(iv) Long-term incentives
Michael Foster's Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  MF Plan')
As described in previous remuneration reports, Michael Foster
was granted an option over the Company's ordinary shares
pursuant to a one-off arrangement that was put in place
specifically to facilitate and secure his appointment as
Commercial Director in 2005. The option was granted pursuant
to paragraph 9.4.2 of the Stock Exchange Listing Rules, and 
so did not require shareholder approval. As a result no awards
were made in respect of the year under review and there is 
no intention to make any awards under this plan in the future.
The options have an exercise price of 217.99 pence, and were
subject to performance conditions based on the Company's
EPS and total shareholder return performance over the three
years from grant. Both conditions were met in full, and so the
option became exercisable on 13 March 2008. 
Charter International plc Long-Term Incentive Plan ( CI LTIP')
The CI LTIP was approved by the shareholders of the Company
on 27 August 2008 and by the shareholders of Charter plc at a
general meeting on 1 October 2008 and is substantially the
same as the Charter 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( 2005
LTIP') adopted by Charter plc prior to the Scheme becoming
effective.
Under the CI LTIP , Executive Directors and selected other
members of Key Management are eligible to receive awards
which vest at nil cost to the executive three years after grant,
subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions. 
An individual may not receive awards in any financial year over
shares having a market value in excess of 100 per cent of their
annual salary except in exceptional circumstances, such as
recruitment or retention, where an individual may receive an
award over shares worth up to 200 per cent of their annual
salary. The current grant policy for Executive Directors is to
grant annual awards of 100 per cent of salary.
Vesting is based on the Company's total shareholder return
performance compared with the constituents of the FTSE 250
Index (excluding investment trusts) over a single three-year
period beginning on the date of the grant of the award. No vesting
occurs for a below median ranking. At median, 25 per cent 
of the shares vest and at upper quartile 100 per cent of the
shares vest. Between median and upper quartile rankings,
awards vest on a straight line basis. In addition, awards 
only vest if the Committee is satisfied that there has been a
significant improvement in the Company's underlying financial
50 REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED)
CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008
performance over the three-year performance period. Awards
normally only vest on or after the third anniversary of the date 
of grant provided that the individual remains an employee of the
Company and the performance conditions and any other
objective conditions have been satisfied.
(v) Share ownership guidelines
The Executive Directors are encouraged to build and maintain 
a holding of 100 per cent worth of salary in shares in the Company.
This is expected to be built via the retention of at least 50 per cent 
of the net gain on vested awards under the Company's share
incentive schemes until the guideline has been achieved.
(vi) Dilution
Since its listing on 22 October 2008 to 31 December 2008, the
Company has remained within the headroom limits set out in the
ABI Guidelines  Executive Remuneration - Policies and Practices',
for the Company's existing share plans as set out below:
Total issued share capital at 31 December 2008 166,751,581
All schemes (10% in any rolling 10-year period) 5,188,220
Remaining headroom 11,486,938
Discretionary schemes (5% in any rolling 10-year period) 5,188,220
Remaining headroom 3,149,359
The Committee has the flexibility to satisfy awards pursuant to
the CI LTIP and the 2005 LTIP by either a market purchase or
new issue of the Company's shares. To date the Company has
not bought shares to hedge the exposure to the Company's
share price; however, the Committee keeps its hedging policy
under review. Awards under the DBP will be satisfied by shares
purchased in the market.
(vii) Pensions
All of the Executive Directors are members of the Charter HM
Revenue & Customs approved pension scheme. Mr Foster's
benefit is one-thirtieth of base salary, and Messrs Careless and
Deeley's benefits are one-forty-fifth of base salary, for each year
of service as an Executive Director. They are all subject to a 
cap on pensionable earnings of  105,600 per annum and are
entitled to receive, in lieu of pension over the cap, an additional
25 per cent of non-pensionable salary to the extent that their
base salaries exceed this cap. These payments are included 
in their emoluments shown on page 53. Mr Deeley has elected
that, from this amount, 9 per cent of his base salary in excess 
of the cap is paid by the Company to the Company's defined
contribution stakeholder pension scheme. Details of pension
entitlements can be found in the table on page 53.
(viii) Other benefits
Further benefits contained within the remuneration packages 
of the Executive Directors comprise tax assessable benefits
arising from employment and include car and petrol allowances,
medical insurance for the Executive Directors and their
immediate dependants and life assurance. (ix) Service contracts
Details of the service contracts of those individuals who served as Executive Directors from 27 August 2008 to 31 December 2008
are set out below. The normal retirement age of all the Executive Directors is 65. 
The Executive Directors entered into new service agreements with Charter Central Services Limited ( CCSL') on 27 August 2008
which became effective on the effective date of the Scheme, being 22 October 2008 (the  Service Agreements' and each a 
 Service Agreement'). The Service Agreements are terminable in writing by CCSL upon 12 months' prior written notice; by Messrs
Careless and Deeley on six months' prior written notice, and by Mr Foster on nine months' prior written notice. If the Service
Agreement of either Michael Foster or Robert Careless is terminated by CCSL except with notice, on retirement or for cause, 
then CCSL shall pay as liquidated damages an amount equal to the value of each Executive Director's annual salary, including
both pension allowance and the value of the Executive Director's lost pension benefits.
CCSL has agreed  tax equalisation' arrangements with each Executive Director under which, if the amount of any remuneration
paid by CCSL or any Associated Company to that Director is taxed in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom, CCSL or 
the Director will make a balancing payment so that the amount received by the Director after tax in respect of that remuneration 
is the same as it would have been had he only been subject to United Kingdom tax in respect of it. Similar  tax equalisation'
arrangements have been agreed between the Company and all of the Non-Executive Directors (including the Chairman). 
The Executive Directors entered into letters of appointment in respect of their duties as Directors of the Company which took effect
on 22 October 2008, being the effective date of the Scheme. Each such appointment will be subject to termination by either party
giving the other party not less than one month's notice in writing and will automatically cease if that Executive Director ceases to
be an employee of CCSL. 
(x) Total shareholder return ( TSR')
TSR calculations are carried out independently by HNBS by monitoring the percentage change in the Company's share price plus
dividends reinvested over a period of time. The chart below shows the value by 31 December 2008, of  100 invested in Charter plc
on 31 December 2003 and re-invested in Charter International plc on the 22 October 2008 as compared with  100 invested in the
FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts) index on the same date.
In the opinion of the Directors, the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) is the most appropriate index against which the
TSR of Charter should be measured because it is an index of similar-sized companies.

DIRECTORS' AND OTHER REPORTS (b) Non-Executive Directors
The Board has delegated authority to the Standing Committee to determine the fees payable to the Chairman and the Non-Executive
Directors. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Company's bonus, pension or share incentive schemes.
They have standard letters of appointment that comply with the recommendations of the Combined Code. Non-Executive appointment
letters are available for inspection at the Company's registered office and will be made available at the AGM.

1 month (Director)
With effect from 1 November 2008, the fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors were increased by 5 per cent from  55,000 to
 57,750 per annum and the fees payable to the chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees were increased by a further
 6,000 and  4,000 per annum respectively. The increases in the fees payable to the chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration
Committees reflect their additional duties as chairmen of those committees. This represents the first change to the fees payable 
to the Non-Executive Directors for three years and takes account of the disruption caused to the Directors as a result of attending
all Board and committee meetings in Ireland. The policy is to review Non-Executive Directors' fees on an annual basis.
(c) External appointments
No Executive Directors currently hold any external directorships of listed companies.
4 Transition arrangements following the Scheme
Prior to the Scheme becoming effective on 22 October 2008, the Executive Directors held a number of awards under share
incentive arrangements operated by Charter plc. These included awards under the 2005 LTIP , the DBP and a one-off option
awarded to Michael Foster. Details of these can be found in the table on page 55. Upon the Scheme becoming effective, 
in accordance with the rules of the 2005 LTIP and the DBP , all outstanding awards under these plans were automatically
exchanged for equivalent awards over ordinary shares in the Company. As the options under the MF Plan would have lapsed 
if not exercised by the effective date of the Scheme, at that time Mr Foster exchanged his option for an equivalent option over
ordinary shares in the Company. None of these awards vested as a result of the Scheme. The replacement awards have the 
same vesting periods, number of shares and other terms as the original awards, and any existing performance targets and/or
conditions will continue to apply as described above.

(1) With effect from the Scheme Effective Date, the remuneration of the Executive Directors was split so that in common with the Non-Executive Directors, they received fees from
Charter International plc of  55,000 in respect of their duties as Directors of Charter International plc. At the same time the salaries received by them from Charter Central
Services Limited in respect of their executive duties on behalf of the rest of the Charter Group were reduced by an equivalent amount so that in aggregate they received the
same remuneration before and after the Scheme Effective Date.
(2) With effect from 1 November 2008, the fees payable to all Directors in respect of their duties as Directors of Charter International plc were increased by 5 per cent from
 55,000 to  57,750 per annum and the fees payable to the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees were increased by a further  6,000 and  4,000 per annum
respectively. The increases in the fees payable to the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees reflect their additional duties as Chairmen of those committees.
These represent the first increases in the fees payable to Non-Executive Directors for three years and take into account the disruption caused to the Directors as a result 
of attending all Board and Committee meetings in Ireland. This increase had no impact on the aggregate remuneration of the Executive Directors since the salaries received 
by them from Charter Central Services Limited were reduced by an amount equal to the increase.
(3) With effect from the annual review on 1 January 2009, the remuneration of the Executive Directors was increased by 3 per cent such that the current base salary and fees 
of the Executive Directors are as follows:
Salary Fees Total
Directors  '000  '000  '000
Michael Foster 457 58 515
Robert Careless 236 58 294
James Deeley 200 58 258
(4) Two Executive Directors (2007:2) have waived their fees from a subsidiary undertaking. Fees waived by these Directors during the year amounted to  1,200 (2007:  1,200).

a Director. 
(2) The pension entitlement shown in the first row is the aggregate amount which would be paid annually on normal retirement based on service to the end of 2008 under the
approved Scheme.
(3) The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
(4) The transfer value of the accrued entitlement represents the value of assets that the pension schemes would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the
scheme's liabilities in respect of the Director's pension benefits. It does not represent sums payable to the individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully 
to annual remuneration.
(5) The transfer value of the increases in accrued benefits, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value of the increase in accrued benefits that the Director has earned 
in the period, whereas the change in its transfer value, required by the Companies Act, discloses the absolute increase or decrease in its transfer value and includes the change
in value of the accrued benefits that results from market volatility affecting the transfer value at the beginning of the period, as well as additional value earned in the year.

(1) Value of options under the MF Plan at 31 December 2008 shows the differences between the market price of the shares at 31 December 2008 and the exercise price 
of the options, multiplied by the number of options. The value of the awards under the LTIP shows the number of the awards held multiplied by the market price of the
Company's shares at 31 December 2008. The assumption is that the maximum number of options/awards vested in accordance with the performance conditions described
on page 50. It should be noted that the actual value may be less than the maximum, including zero if performance conditions are not met.
(2) The number of shares granted on 25 March 2008 is the share equivalent of 100 per cent of the base salary based on the average of the mid-market closing values of the
Company's shares for the five dealing days ending on 20 March 2008 of 771.6 pence.
