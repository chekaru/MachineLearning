* The period of notice from the employer for executive directors during the year was 24 months. Under their contractual terms this notice period
was scheduled to reduce to 12 months with effect from 6 June 2003 and 30 September 2003 for Mr Gawler and Mr Eilbeck respectively . At the
request of the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and in line with best practice, Mr Gawler agreed to reduce his notice period from the
employer to 12 months with effect from 6 March 2003. However Mr Eilbeck has decided to retain his existing contractual rights in this regard
until 30 September 2003 when the period of notice from the employer will automatically reduce to 12 months and the period of notice from the
executive to 6 months.
** Messrs Johnson and Taylor resigned on 24 April 2002 and, consequently , their contracts terminated. 23 Charter plc Annual Report 2002
The gross amount of the total payment payable in cash, will be calculated in accordance with the formula  1 x ((V-200) x 60V) where V is a
number , being the lesser of the number of pence in the Relevant Share Price  and 500.
For these purposes the Relevant Share Price  is generally based on an average share price in the 30 day period immediately following the
date the award vests or , in the event of a change of control, the price per share of the relevant offer or , in the case of some other major
corporate reorganisation, any amount of value per share which is returned to shareholders taken together with the average share price in the
subsequent 30 day period. In addition, the value per share of any equity subscriptions made by the Company's shareholders during the term
of the plan will be deducted from the Relevant Share Price for the purposes of calculating the payment to be made on vesting of the award.
At the last annual general meeting of the Company held on 24 April 2002, an incentive plan with the same terms as for Mr Gawler above,
with the exception that the potential benefits are a third of the level that apply to Mr Gawler , was approved for Mr Eilbeck.
Pensions
Mr Gawler is not a member of the Company's pension scheme. Since becoming an executive director a contribution of  125,000 per annum
is paid to him in lieu of a pension entitlement and is included in his emoluments on page 24. This contribution level is reviewable annually .
Mr Eilbeck is a member of the Company's Inland Revenue approved pension scheme providing pension benefits of one-thirtieth of salary for
each year of service. He is subject to the cap on pensionable earnings and, to the extent that the approved scheme is unable to provide
pension on his earnings in excess of the Inland Revenue earnings cap, a funded unapproved scheme has been established to make good
the shortfall. Because of the tax rules which apply to the unapproved scheme, he received an additional pension related payment being
compensation in relation to tax payable on the contribution to that scheme. The aggregate of benefit from the approved scheme, benefit from
the unapproved scheme and the pension related payment is equivalent to a pension of one-thirtieth of uncapped salary for each year of
service. The accrued entitlement given below includes entitlements earned as an employee, prior to becoming a director as well as those
earned for qualifying services after becoming a director .

(i) The pension entitlement shown in the first row is the aggregate amount which would be paid annually on normal retirement based on service
to the end of the year 2002 under the approved and unapproved schemes.
(ii) The transfer value of the benefit accrued during the year excludes any increase for inflation.
(iii) The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
(iv) The transfer value of the accrued entitlement represents the value of assets that the pension schemes would need to transfer to another
pension provider on transferring the schemes' liability in respect of the director's pension benefits. It does not represent sums payable to the
individual director and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
(v) The transfer value of the increase in accrued benefits, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value of the increase in accrued
benefits that the director has earned in the period, whereas the change in his transfer value, required by the Companies Act, discloses the
absolute increase or decrease in his transfer value and includes the change in value of the accrued benefits that results from market volatility
affecting the transfer value at the beginning of the period, as well as the additional value earned in the year . 24 Charter plc Annual Report 2002

*  The contribution of  102,000 (2001:  84,000) made to Mr Eilbeck's funded unapproved pension scheme is not included in the benefits column
of the directors' emoluments table, but is incorporated in the Director's Pension table relating to Mr Eilbeck on page 23.
** During the year the directors reviewed the disclosures relating to pension related payments. These payments compensate directors in relation
to tax payable by them on the contributions to their funded unapproved pension schemes. It has been decided that these payments should no
longer be incorporated in the pensions disclosures, but rather within the directors' emoluments table. As a result, the following directors'
emoluments for 2001 have been amended to reflect the pension related payments in respect of that year: Mr Eilbeck  56,000, Mr Robson
 384,000 and Mr Smith  68,000.
Aggregate emoluments as defined in the Companies Act, that is excluding compensation for loss of office, were  1,166,000 (2001:
 1,857,000).
The Company believes that it is in shareholders' interests to attract, motivate and retain high calibre executives and has to date believed that
two year contracts are important in this regard. Therefore, the current executive directors were given contracts in 2001 that initially had two
year rolling terms with predetermined liquidated damages provisions. However , Mr Gawler has agreed to reduce his notice period from the
employer to 12 months with effect from 6 March 2003. Mr Eilbeck has decided to retain his existing contractual rights in this regard until 30
September 2003 when the period of notice from the employer will automatically reduce to 12 months and the period of notice from the
executive to 6 months.
During the year an amount of  489,000 was paid to Mr Robson, a former director . This lump sum payment, which was provided for in 2001
and was reflected in the Directors' Pension table in that year , was made in connection with his retirement to cover part of the cost of purchasing
an annuity from an insurance company .
Equity Partnership Plan
The Equity Partnership Plan was approved by shareholders in 1997. Its objective was to strengthen the link between executive rewards and
the creation of value for shareholders. Under the Equity Partnership Plan, selected executives received two types of incentive awards (Bonus
Shares  and Performance Shares ) which, respectively , reflected the focus on medium and long term performance.
No new awards have been made under the Equity Partnership Plan since 1999. Details of the options granted in prior years in respect of
the Equity Partnership Plan awards are included in the table of options shown on page 25. As none of the performance targets associated
with any of the awards has been met, the awards would only be of value in the event of a change in control of the Company .
Employee Share Ownership Trust
T o facilitate the operation of the Equity Partnership Plan, the Company established the Charter Employee Share Ownership Trust (the Trust )
for the purpose (amongst other things) of acquiring and holding shares in the Company to satisfy awards made under the Equity Partnership
Plan. The funds to acquire the shares in the Company necessary to satisfy awards made under the Equity Partnership Plan will be contributed
from the group companies to the trustees of the Trust. Shares will be acquired by the Trust either by purchase from a third party or subscription
(at par or greater), at such time prior to release as shall be determined by the Company and the trustees.

Share options and interests in shares
Prior to his appointment as a director Mr Eilbeck was granted the options and awards under the Equity Partnership Plan disclosed in the table
below. Options were granted at the current market price and are normally exerciseable between three and ten years after the grant. The
exercise of options is subject to the achievement of a performance target. The target is that the growth in earnings per share must exceed the
increase in the retail price index by 1
1
 2% over a consecutive period of three years.
The interests of directors in shares and share options of the Company as at 31 December 2002, all of which are beneficial interests, are as
follows:
Options

* The exercise prices of these awards made under the Equity Partnership Plan are 831.2p, 710.5p and 376.0p. They would if exercised however ,
be funded by a cash bonus payable at the date of exercise of the options and therefore the effective cost to the director is nil. The share price
on 31 December 2001 was 126.0p and on 31 December 2002 was 75.0p. The high price for the year was 206.0p and the low 71.5p.
There was no change in the interests of current directors between 31 December 2002 and 7 March 2003. An update will be given in the notice
of the annual general meeting.
In the opinion of the directors, the FTSE Engineering and Machinery Sector Index is the most appropriate index against which the total
shareholder return of Charter plc should be measured because it is an index of companies in similar businesses.
