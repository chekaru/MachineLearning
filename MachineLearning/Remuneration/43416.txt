 Charter plc Annual Report 2007 47
Remuneration report
The Directors present the Remuneration report for the year ended 
31 December 2007. The report contains all of the information 
that is required by Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and
describes how the Company has applied the principles of the
Combined Code with regard to remuneration. Sections 3(iii), 3(iv), 
3(v), 3(vi), 3(b) and the notes to the Remuneration report on pages 
50 and 51 are subject to audit.
1 The Remuneration Committee 
The Board has delegated authority to the Committee to review the
remuneration trends across the Company and its major businesses
and to determine the remuneration and other terms and conditions 
of the Executive Directors, the Chairman, the Company Secretary and 
the Key Management of the Company, as shown on pages 36 to 38. 
The Committee is also responsible for reviewing the remuneration 
of those individuals identified as senior management by the Board 
of the Company.
Throughout 2007 the members of the Committee were as follows: 
The Hon. James Bruce (Chairman), John Biles, Grey Denham and
Andrew Osborne. Lars Emilson was appointed as a member of the
Committee on 14 September 2007 and, as Company Chairman, is
absent when his own fee is discussed by the Committee. All members
of the Committee are deemed independent in accordance with the
Combined Code (Lars Emilson was independent on appointment 
to the Company). Details of the number of meetings held by the
Committee during the year, as well as attendance details, can be
found in the table contained in the Corporate governance report 
on page 42.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available upon request 
from the Company Secretary and are on the Company' s website. 
The Committee has access to the advice of the Chief Executive and 
the Company Secretary (neither of whom participated in any discussion
relating to their own remuneration) and a number of external advisers
in conducting its duties. During 2007 the Committee consulted the
following: Hewitt Associates, who provided the Company with actuarial
advice in relation to pensions and New Bridge Street Consultants LLP
( NBSC'), who provided independent advice to the Committee
regarding Executive Directors' remuneration and long term incentive
arrangements (but no further services to the Company).
2 Remuneration policy 
The policy for Executive Directors and Key Management is designed 
to enable the Company to attract, motivate and retain individuals 
by ensuring that their rewards are both competitive and linked 
to individual and business performance.
Consistent with this policy, the remuneration packages of the
Executive Directors are intended to be competitive and comprise 
both fixed and performance-related elements. Performance-related
elements are designed to comprise a significant part of potential
remuneration. Executive Directors' remuneration is reviewed each 
year to ensure that it is supportive of the Company's business
objectives and the creation of shareholder value. It is the intention 
of the Committee that there should be long-term incentive plans for
Executive Directors whereby they are rewarded with interests in the
Company's shares for sustained performance over a period of time.
The remuneration packages for other Key Management are designed
to operate on a basis similar to that of the Executive Directors.
3 Remuneration
(a) Executive Directors
(i) Base salary
The base salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed annually 
and following exceptional one-off events where the individual
responsibilities of the Executive Director change significantly. Salaries 
are benchmarked against those paid to directors in companies of 
a similar size and international complexity as well as those operating 
within comparable sectors.
The salaries of the Executive Directors were reviewed with effect from
1 November 2007 taking into account the additional responsibilities
that they assumed following the appointment of a Non-Executive
Chairman rather than an Executive Chairman on 1 November 2007.
These reviews incorporated the annual review of Executive Directors'
salaries which would otherwise have taken place on 1 January 2008.
(ii) Bonus
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2007 the Executive
Directors were contractually entitled to receive a maximum bonus 
of 100 per cent of base salary depending on the achievement of 
a number of corporate and individual targets as discussed below. 
It is the Company' s policy that bonuses are only payable for the
achievement of stretching performance targets, the majority of which
are linked to the financial performance of the Company. For the year
ended 31 December 2007, these targets were as follows:
1. 64 per cent of bonus: EPS performance relative to budget
2. 16 per cent of bonus: Cash flow performance relative to budget
3. 20 per cent of bonus: Personal performance.
For targets 1 and 2, 50 per cent of the maximum bonus on each part
would be payable for meeting budget, the maximum bonus would 
only become payable for performance that was substantially in excess 
of budget and no bonus would be payable for performance that 
was substantially below budget. The Committee has reserved the
overriding discretion to review aggregate bonus levels payable 
to Executive Directors based on the above criteria to ensure that they 
are appropriate taking into account the overall financial performance 
of the Company and its performance relative to the market. No bonuses
payable to Executive Directors are pensionable. Bonuses equivalent 
to 99.2 per cent of salary were awarded to the Executive Directors 
in respect of the year ended 31 December 2007.
For the year ending 31 December 2008, bonuses payable to the
Executive Directors will be measured against the same performance
objectives as those used in determining the 2007 bonus entitlements
of the Executive Directors save that target 2 (cash flow performance
relative to budget) will be appraised both at the half year and the 
full year. Targets 1 (EPS performance in relation to budget) and 3
(Personal performance) will continue to be appraised at the year end.
Deferred Bonus Plan ( DBP')
One quarter of any bonus paid to Executive Directors (i.e. up to 
25 per cent of salary) will be paid in shares acquired in the market 
and compulsorily deferred for three years under the DBP . If the
Executive Director leaves voluntarily or for cause during this deferral
period, his awards will normally lapse. These shares are held in trust
prior to their release on vesting following the expiration of the three
year deferral period.  (iii) Long-term incentives
Michael Foster's Long-term Incentive Plan (the  MF Plan')
Michael Foster was granted an option over the Company's ordinary
shares pursuant to a one-off arrangement that was put in place
specifically to facilitate and secure his appointment as Commercial
Director in 2005. As a result no awards were made under the MF Plan
in respect of the year under review and there is no intention to make
any awards under this plan in the future.
The option vests on 13 March 2008, following the announcement of
the Company's Preliminary Results for the year ended 31 December
2007 and is exercisable for a period of 12 months thereafter. Two
performance conditions are attached to the MF Plan.
Exercise of 50 per cent of the option requires average real earnings 
per share growth of 3 per cent per annum over a single three-year
period whilst exercise of the remaining 50 per cent is dependent 
on the Company's Total Shareholder Return ( TSR') performance
compared to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding
Investment Trusts). No vesting will occur for a below median TSR
ranking, 50 per cent of the TSR portion of the grant will vest for a
median ranking and 100 per cent will vest for a ranking within the
upper quartile, with straight line vesting for intermediate performance.
Benefits under the MF Plan are not pensionable.
The Committee has determined, following advice from its external
remuneration consultants, NBSC, that the TSR ranking of the Company
was No. 2 in the FTSE 250 Index (excluding Investment Trusts) and
thus was in the upper quartile TSR ranking, and that the average 
real earnings per share growth over the performance period was 
229 per cent above the three per cent performance condition.
Accordingly the option will vest on 13 March 2008.
Charter 2005 Long-term Incentive Plan ( LTIP')
Under the LTIP , Executive Directors and selected other members of
Key Management are eligible to receive awards in one of three forms: 
(i) conditional allocations, where a participant receives free ordinary
shares in the Company automatically on vesting; (ii) nil (or nominal)
cost options, where a participant can decide when to exercise his
award during a short period after it has vested; or (iii) forfeitable shares
in the Company, which are similar to conditional shares except that 
the participant has certain shareholder rights prior to vesting. 
The Remuneration Committee may also decide to grant cash-based
awards of an equivalent value to share-based awards or to satisfy
share-based awards in cash (either in whole or in part), although 
it does not intend to do so except where it would be expedient 
in overseas jurisdictions.
An individual may not receive awards in any financial year over shares
having a market value in excess of 100 per cent of his annual salary
except, in exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or retention,
where an individual may receive an award over shares worth up to 
200 per cent of his annual salary.
Vesting is based on the Company's TSR performance compared to
the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts)
over a single three-year period beginning on the date of the grant 
of the award. No vesting occurs for a below median ranking. 
At median, 25 per cent of the shares vest and at upper quartile 
100 per cent of the shares vest. Between median and upper quartile
rankings, awards vest on a straight line basis. In addition, awards 
only vest if the Committee is satisfied that there has been a significant
improvement in the Company's underlying financial performance over
the three-year performance period. Awards normally only vest on or
after the third anniversary of the date of grant provided the individual
remains an employee of the Company and the performance conditions
and any other objective conditions have been satisfied. LTIP participants
have received annual conditional awards of shares at nil cost from 
its inception.
48 Charter plc Annual Report 2007
Remuneration report (continued)
During the year the Committee made five awards pursuant to the LTIP .
On 22 March 2007, Michael Foster, Robert Careless, James Deeley,
Jon Templeman and Bob Cleland were made conditional awards 
of shares and details of the awards made to the Executive Directors
can be found on page 51. 
(iv) Dilution
During the year the Company remained within the headroom limits 
set out in the ABI Guidelines  Executive Remuneration - Policies and
Practices', for the Company's existing share plans as set out below:
Total issued share capital at 31 December 2007 166,699,142
All schemes (10% in any rolling 10-year period) 5,803,621
Remaining headroom 10,866,293
Discretionary schemes (5% in any rolling 10-year period) 5,803,621
Remaining headroom 2,531,336
The Committee has the flexibility to satisfy awards pursuant to the LTIP
by either a market purchase or new issue of the Company's shares. 
To date the Company has not bought shares to hedge the exposure 
to the Company's share price, however, the Committee intends to
review its hedging policy closer to the date for the vesting of the first
awards under the LTIP . Awards under the DBP will be satisfied by
shares purchased on the market.
(v) Pensions
Michael Foster and Robert Careless are both members of the
Company's HMRC approved pension scheme, providing benefits 
of one-thirtieth of base salary and one-forty-fifth of base salary
respectively for each year of service as an Executive Director. 
They are both subject to a cap on pensionable earnings of  105,600
per annum and are entitled to receive, in lieu of pension over the cap,
an additional 25 per cent of non-pensionable salary to the extent that
their base salaries exceed this cap. These payments are included in
their emoluments shown on page 50.
James Deeley is a member of the Company's HMRC approved
pension scheme and is provided with benefits of one-forty-fifth 
of his base salary for each year of pensionable service subject 
to a cap on pensionable earnings of  105,600. Prior to 1 November
2007 the Company additionally contributed 9 per cent of his base
salary in excess of this cap to the Company's defined contribution
stakeholder pension scheme. Following 1 November 2007 in lieu 
of pension over the cap, Mr Deeley is entitled to receive an additional
25 per cent of non-pensionable salary to the extent that his base
salary exceeds the cap. This change was made in order to align 
Mr Deeley's benefits with those of Messrs Foster and Careless.
Details of pension entitlements can be found in the table on page 50.
(vi) Other benefits
Further benefits contained within the remuneration packages of 
the Executive Directors comprise tax assessable benefits arising 
from employment and include car and petrol allowances, medical
insurance for the Executive Directors and their immediate dependants
and life assurance. Charter plc Annual Report 2007 49
(vii) Service contracts
Details of the service contracts of those individuals who served as Executive Directors during the year are set out in the table below: The service
contracts of all Executive Directors, other than that of David Gawler, contain a retirement age of 65.

(1) David Gawler retired on 31 October 2007.
(viii) Total shareholder return ( TSR')
TSR calculations are carried out independently by NBSC by monitoring the percentage change in the Company's share price plus dividends
reinvested over a period of time. The chart below sets out the TSR generated by Charter and the TSR of the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index
(excluding investment trusts) since 2002.
In the opinion of the Directors, the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) is the most appropriate index against which the TSR of 
Charter plc should be measured because it is an index of similar sized companies.
(b) Non-Executive Directors 
The Board has delegated authority to the Executive Committee to determine the fees payable to the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Company's bonus, pension or share incentive schemes. They have standard
letters of appointment that comply with the recommendations of the Combined Code. Non-Executive appointment letters are available for
inspection at the Company's registered office and will be made available at the AGM.

incremental duties as Chairman. The policy is to review Non-Executive Directors' fees on an annual basis but no change was made during the year
ended 31 December 2007.

(1) The accrued entitlement includes that earned by Robert Careless as an employee, prior to becoming a Director, as well as that earned for qualifying services after becoming a Director.
(2) The pension entitlement shown in the first row is the aggregate amount which would be paid annually on normal retirement based on service to the end of 2007 under the approved scheme.
(3) The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
(4) The transfer value of the accrued entitlement represents the value of assets that the pension schemes would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the scheme's liabilities in respect of the
Director's pension benefits. It does not represent sums payable to the individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
(5) The transfer value of the increases in accrued benefits, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value of the increase in accrued benefits that the Director has earned in the period, whereas the
change in his transfer value, required by the Companies Act, discloses the absolute increase or decrease in his transfer value and includes the change in value of the accrued benefits that results from market
volatility affecting the transfer value at the beginning of the period, as well as additional value earned in the year.

(1) Value of options under the MF Plan at 31 December 2007 shows the differences between the market price of the shares at 31 December 2007 and the exercise price of the options, multiplied by the number 
of options. The value of the awards under the LTIP shows the number of the awards held multiplied by the market price of the Company's shares at 31 December 2007. The assumption is that the maximum
number of options/awards vested in accordance with the performance conditions described on page 48.
(2) The number of shares granted on 22 March 2007 is the share equivalent of 100 per cent of the base salary based on the average of the mid-market closing values of the Company's shares for the 
5 dealing days ending on 22 March 2007 of 891.3 pence.
(3) The price of an ordinary share on 22 March 2007 was 913 pence. During the year, the range of share prices was 728.5 pence to 1,245 pence, with the price on 31 December 2007 being 793.5 pence.
