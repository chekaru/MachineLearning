 REMUNERATION
The objective of the Remuneration Committee is that executive Directors should receive compensation which is appropriate
to their responsibilities and performance and which will attract, motivate and retain executives of the right calibre. The
comparator group for remuneration purposes comprises companies and partnerships in the management consultancy and
IT fields matched to Charteris by reference to sectors and the growth and size characteristics of the business.
The executive Directors have guaranteed remuneration that is primarily determined by the time spent on the business
development and general management of the Company. In addition, they are paid bonuses, which are dependent upon
the financial performance of the Company and individual time billed to consultancy clients of the Company. Aggregate
remuneration built up from these elements will be at the level of a notional full-time salary, provided threshold financial
targets and/or threshold individual consultancy billing targets are achieved. However, dependent upon the extent of such
achievement aggregate remuneration may exceed or fall short of the notional full-time salary. Notional full-time salaries
were on average 10.9% higher in the year ended 31 July 2002 compared to the previous year.

SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
Existing Unapproved Scheme
The Company adopted an Unapproved Option Scheme (the Existing Unapproved Scheme) on 20 April 1998 under
which options over 5,787,000 shares were later granted to certain team members and Directors of which 1,096,500
remain exercisable. No options have been granted under the Scheme since 1 August 2000 and none will be granted in
future. The Board may impose financial targets that must be satisfied before any option granted can be exercised.
EMI Scheme
The Company adopted an Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme on 24 October 2000. Financial targets may be
imposed that must be satisfied before any options granted can be exercised. Options over 1,515,842 shares have been
granted, of which 1,506,842 remain exercisable.
Unapproved Scheme
The Company adopted an Unapproved Scheme on 24 October 2000. Financial targets may be imposed that must be satisfied
before any option granted can be exercised. Options over 27,778 shares have been granted, all of which remain exercisable.
Approved Scheme
The Company adopted an Approved Share Option Scheme on 21 November 2001. The Company intends to issue share
options out of this scheme to its employees within the prescribed limits of  30,000, or four times the employee's salary,
whichever is the lower. Options will not be exercisable within three years or after ten years from the date of grant. There are
tax advantages to both the Company and the employee in operating an Inland Revenue Approved Share Option Scheme.
General Employee Benefit Trust
In March 2000 Charteris established a General Employee Benefit Trust (the Trust) that subsequently subscribed for a
total of 1,500,000 Ordinary Shares in the Company and purchased an additional 54,431 shares. 1,050,000 of these
shares were linked to an incentive scheme under which the Directors had the discretion to invite selected team members
to purchase up to 1,050,000 shares held by the Trust at a price of 18.57p per share. The Directors distributed these
shares on 3 December 2001 on a merit basis to members of the team who had made notable contributions to the
Company's development. The mechanism used to do this was EMI share options issued by the Trust at 18.57p that
were immediately exercisable. No Directors were granted any options under these arrangements.
The remaining 504,431 shares in the Trust can potentially be used to satisfy the exercise of options under share
incentive schemes. 
Directors' share options
Certain of the Directors have rights to acquire ordinary shares in the Company by the exercise of options. Details of
these options are as follows:
