 Charteris Annual Report 2004

REMUNERATION
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee is Cliff Preddy. David Mann and Paul Biddle are the other members. The
committee meets at least twice a year. It makes recommendations to the Board on all elements of the remuneration framework
for the Executive Directors and our most senior employees, and also determines and approves their specific remuneration
packages. The committee determines and approves any contract of employment with Executive Directors and our most senior
employees, and agrees any termination arrangements in the event of early termination. It also makes recommendations
concerning share option schemes and other share-related and long term incentive schemes, approves awards under such
schemes and specifies any performance criteria that should apply.
The objective of the Remuneration Committee is that Executive Directors should receive compensation which is appropriate to
their responsibilities and performance and which will attract, motivate and retain executives of the right calibre. The comparator
group for remuneration purposes comprises companies and partnerships in the management consultancy and IT fields, matched
to Charteris by reference to sectors and the growth and size characteristics of the business.
The Executive Directors have guaranteed remuneration that is primarily determined by the time spent on the business development
and general management of the Company. In addition, they are paid bonuses, which are dependent upon the financial performance
of the Company and individual time billed to consultancy clients. Aggregate remuneration built up from these elements will be at the
level of a notional full time salary, if financial targets and/or individual consultancy billing targets are achieved. However, dependent
upon the extent of such achievement, aggregate remuneration may exceed or fall short of the notional full time salary.
Guaranteed remuneration for the Non-Executive Directors consists of their Directors' fees.

SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
Existing Unapproved Scheme
The Company adopted an unapproved option scheme (the Existing Unapproved Scheme) on 20 April 1998 under which
options over 5,787,000 shares were later granted to certain team members and Directors of which 640,333 remain exercisable.
No options have been granted under the scheme since 1 August 2000 and none will be granted in future.
EMI Scheme
The Company adopted an Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme on 24 October 2000. Financial targets may be imposed
that must be satisfied before any options granted can be exercised. Options over 2,126,811 shares remain exercisable or
potentially exercisable under this scheme.
Report of the Remuneration Committee 17
Unapproved Scheme
The Company adopted an Unapproved Scheme on 24 October 2000. Financial targets may be imposed that must be satisfied
before any option granted can be exercised. Options over 100,889 shares remain potentially exercisable under this scheme.
Approved Scheme
The Company adopted an Approved Share Option Scheme on 21 November 2001. The Company may issue share options
under this scheme to its employees within the prescribed limits of  30,000, or four times the employee's salary, whichever is the
lower. Options will not be exercisable within three years or after ten years from the date of grant. Options over 187,000 shares
remain potentially exercisable under this scheme.
General Employee Benefit Trust
At key points in the development of Charteris the Directors have felt it appropriate to establish special incentives for key
members of management, sales staff and team members. In such cases, whenever possible, they have sought to match the
associated option grants with existing shares held by a General Employee Benefit Trust (the Trust) that was established in March
2000. The Trust initially subscribed for a total of 1,500,000 Ordinary Shares in the Company and later purchased an additional
1,020,781 existing shares in the market.
1,050,000 of the Trust's shares were linked to EMI share options granted under a pre-existing incentive scheme to selected team
members on 3 December 2001 at a price of 18.57p per share. As at 31 July 2004 127,200 shares had been used by the Trust in
satisfaction of share option exercises under these arrangements and options over 323,600 shares had lapsed, leaving options over
599,200 shares outstanding.
Two additional grants of EMI share options were later made, each linked to trust shares and with performance conditions based
upon the achievement of the strategic plan over the three-year period ending 31 July 2006. These grants were over 695,000
shares on 25 July 2003 at 18p and a further 568,000 shares on 14 October 2003 at 28p.
The EMI options linked to shares held by the Trust are included in the total for the EMI Scheme disclosed above. 
At 31 July 2004 the Trust held 2,393,581 shares and the remaining 531,381 shares in the Trust can potentially be used to satisfy
other exercises of options.
Limits on issue of new shares
The maximum number of new Ordinary Shares issued or issuable by the Company under the EMI Scheme, the Unapproved
Scheme and the Approved Scheme during the ten-year period commencing on 24 October 2000 is limited to 15% of the
Company's issued share capital. As at 31 July 2004 options had been granted over a total of 978,589 shares that were not
specifically matched by existing shares held by the Trust, representing 2.3% of issued share capital. 
Directors' share options
Certain of the Directors have rights to acquire ordinary shares in the Company by the exercise of options. The grants have been
made subject to performance conditions based upon significant growth in revenue or profit during a performance period. These
conditions determine the percentage of the options granted that may be exercised. Details of these options are set out below,
including the number of options that may now be exercised, where the relevant performance period has been completed.
