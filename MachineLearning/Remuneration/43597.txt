 14 Charteris Annual Report 2006
Remuneration
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on the Company's framework for executive and senior staff
remuneration and its cost. The Committee determines and approves on behalf of the Board any contract of
employment or related contract with executive directors or senior staff and agrees any termination arrangements in
the event of early termination. The Committee also makes recommendations to the Board on the Company's overall
limits and policies for share option schemes and other share-related and long term incentive schemes.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee is Cliff Preddy and committee members are David Mann and Paul
Biddle. The Remuneration Committee meets as necessary, but at least twice a year.
The objective of the Remuneration Committee is that Executive Directors should receive compensation which is
appropriate to their responsibilities and performance and which will attract, motivate and retain executives of the
right calibre. The comparator group for remuneration purposes comprises companies and partnerships in the
management consultancy and IT fields matched to Charteris by reference to sectors and the growth and size
characteristics of the business.
The Executive Directors have guaranteed remuneration that is primarily determined by the time spent on the
business development and general management of the Company. In addition, they are paid bonuses, which are
dependent upon the financial performance of the Company and individual time billed to consultancy clients.
Aggregate remuneration built up from these elements will be at the level of a notional full time salary, if financial
targets and/or individual consultancy billing targets are achieved. However, dependent upon the extent of such
achievement, aggregate remuneration may exceed or fall short of the notional full time salary.
Guaranteed remuneration for the Non-Executive Directors consists of their Directors' fees.

Share option schemes
Existing Unapproved Scheme
The Company adopted an unapproved option scheme (the Existing Unapproved Scheme) on 20 April 1998 under
which options over 5,787,000 shares were later granted to certain team members and Directors of which 601,333
remain exercisable. No options have been granted under the scheme since 1 August 2000 and none will be
granted in future.

EMI Scheme
The Company adopted an Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme on 24 October 2000. Financial targets may
be imposed that must be satisfied before any options granted can be exercised. Options over 2,583,940 shares
remain exercisable or potentially exercisable under this scheme.
Unapproved Scheme
The Company adopted an Unapproved Scheme on 24 October 2000. Financial targets may be imposed that must
be satisfied before any option granted can be exercised. Options over 66,160 shares remain potentially exercisable
under this scheme.
Approved Scheme
The Company adopted an Approved Share Option Scheme on 21 November 2001. The Company may issue share
options under this scheme to its employees within the prescribed limits of  30,000, or four times the employee's
salary, whichever is the lower. Options will not be exercisable within three years or after ten years from the date of
grant. Options over 564,850 shares remain potentially exercisable under this scheme.
General Employee Benefit Trust
At key points in the development of Charteris the Directors have felt it appropriate to establish special incentives for
key members of management, sales staff and team members. In such cases, whenever possible, they have sought
to match the associated option grants with existing shares held by a General Employee Benefit Trust (the Trust) that
was established in March 2000. The Trust initially subscribed for a total of 1,500,000 Ordinary Shares in the
Company and later purchased an additional 1,020,781 existing shares in the market.
1,050,000 of the Trust's shares were linked to EMI share options granted under a pre-existing incentive scheme to
selected team members on 3 December 2001 at a price of 18.57p per share. As at 31 July 2005 203,900 shares
had been used by the Trust in satisfaction of share option exercises under these arrangements and options over
323,600 shares had lapsed, leaving options over 522,500 shares outstanding.
Four additional grants of EMI share options were later made, each linked to trust shares and with performance
conditions based upon the achievement of the strategic plan over the three-year period ended 31 July 2006. The
Group's trading performance in this period has resulted in 58% of options granted vesting in the grantees. As a
result of this the following options have vested:
Granted Exercise price Vested
25 July 2003 18p 150,800
14 October 2003 28p 329,440
12 November 2004 28p 200,100
30 June 2005 41p 87,000
The EMI options linked to shares held by the Trust are included in the total for the EMI Scheme disclosed above.
At 31 July 2006 the Trust held 2,316,881 shares and the remaining 1,027,041 shares in the Trust can potentially be
used to satisfy other exercises of options.
Limits on issue of new shares
In addition to the Trust shares, the maximum number of new Ordinary Shares issued or issuable by the Company
under the EMI Scheme, the Unapproved Scheme and the Approved Scheme during the ten-year period
commencing on 24 October 2000 is limited to 15% of the Company's issued share capital. As at 31 July 2005
options had been granted to issue a total of 2,731,939 shares, representing 6.4% of issued share capital. Directors' share options
Included in the disclosures above, certain of the Directors have rights to acquire ordinary shares in the Company by
the exercise of options. The grants have been made subject to performance conditions based upon significant
growth in revenue or profit during a performance period. These conditions determine the percentage of the options
granted that may be exercised. Details of these options are set out below, including the number of options that
may now be exercised, where the relevant performance period has been completed.
