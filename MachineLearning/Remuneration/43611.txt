 Charteris Annual Report 2007 17
Remuneration
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on the Company's framework for executive and senior staff
remuneration and its cost. The Committee determines and approves on behalf of the Board any contract of
employment or related contract with executive directors or senior staff, and reviews of the same, and agrees any
termination arrangements in the event of early termination. The Committee also makes recommendations to the
Board on the Company's overall limits and policies for share option schemes and other share-related and long term
incentive schemes.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee is David Mann and committee members are Cliff Preddy and Paul
Biddle. The Remuneration Committee meets as necessary, but at least twice a year.
The objective of the Remuneration Committee is that Executive Directors should receive compensation which is
appropriate to their responsibilities and performance and which will attract, motivate and retain executives of the
right calibre. The comparator group for remuneration purposes comprise companies and partnerships in the
management consultancy and IT fields matched to Charteris by reference to sectors, growth and size, and publicly
quoted companies across a wider field but with similar market capitalisations.
The Executive Directors have guaranteed remuneration that is primarily determined by the time spent on the
business development and general management of the Company. In addition, they are paid bonuses, which are
dependent upon the financial performance of the Company and/or individual time billed to consultancy clients.
Guaranteed remuneration for the Non-Executive Directors consists of their Directors' fees.

Share option schemes
EMI Scheme
The Company adopted an Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme on 24 October 2000. Financial targets may
be imposed that must be satisfied before any options granted can be exercised. Options over 3,961,540 shares
remain exercisable or potentially exercisable under this scheme.
Unapproved Scheme
The Company adopted an Unapproved Scheme on 24 October 2000. Financial targets may be imposed that
must be satisfied before any option granted can be exercised. Options over 61,160 shares remain potentially
exercisable under this scheme.
Approved Scheme
The Company adopted an Approved Share Option Scheme on 21 November 2001. The Company may issue
share options under this scheme to its employees within the prescribed limits of  30,000, or four times the
employee's salary, whichever is the lower. Options will not be exercisable within three years or after ten years
from the date of grant. Options over 405,950 shares remain potentially exercisable under this scheme.
General Employee Benefit Trust
At key points in the development of Charteris the Directors have felt it appropriate to establish special incentives
for key members of management, sales staff and team members. In such cases, whenever possible, they have
sought to match the associated option grants with existing shares held by a General Employee Benefit Trust (the
Trust) that was established in March 2000. The EMI options linked to shares held by the Trust are included in the
total for the EMI Scheme disclosed above. At 31 July 2007 the Trust held 2,316,881 shares (2006: 2,316,881).
Directors' share options
Included in the disclosures above, certain Directors have rights to acquire ordinary shares in the Company by the
exercise of options as set out in the table below. The grants have been made subject to performance conditions
based upon significant growth in revenue or profit during a performance period. These conditions determine the
percentage of the options granted that may be exercised. No share options were exercised by Directors during
the year.
