 Charteris Annual Report 2008 19
Remuneration
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on the Company's framework for executive and senior staff
remuneration and its cost. The Committee determines and approves on behalf of the Board any contract of
employment or related contract with executive Directors or senior staff and agrees any termination arrangements in
the event of early termination. The Committee also makes recommendations to the Board on the Company's overall
limits and policies for share option schemes and other share-related and long term incentive schemes.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee is David Mann and committee members are Cliff Preddy and Paul
Biddle. The Remuneration Committee meets as necessary, but at least twice a year.
The objective of the Remuneration Committee is that Executive Directors should receive compensation which is
appropriate to their responsibilities and performance and which will attract, motivate and retain executives of the
right calibre. The comparator group for remuneration purposes comprises companies and partnerships in the
management consultancy and IT fields matched to Charteris by reference to sectors and the growth and size
characteristics of the business.
The Executive Directors have base remuneration packages that are primarily determined by the time expected to be
spent on business development and general management of the Company. In addition, they are paid bonuses, which
are dependent upon the financial performance of the Company and/or individual time billed to consultancy clients.
Remuneration for the Non-Executive Directors consists of their Directors' fees.

Approved Scheme
The Company adopted an Approved Share Option Scheme on 21 November 2001. The Company may issue share
options under this scheme to its employees within the prescribed limits of  30,000, or four times the employee's
salary, whichever is the lower. Options will not be exercisable within three years or after ten years from the date of
grant. Options over 217,000 shares remain potentially exercisable under this scheme.
General Employee Benefit Trust
At key points in the development of Charteris the Directors have felt it appropriate to establish special incentives for
key members of management, sales staff and team members. In such cases, whenever possible, they have sought
to match the associated option grants with existing shares held by a General Employee Benefit Trust (the Trust) that
was established in March 2000. The EMI options linked to shares held by the Trust are included in the total for the
EMI Scheme disclosed above. At 31 July 2008 the Trust held 2,316,881 shares (2007: 2,316,881) of which
2,113,700 (2007: 2,257,700) are reserved for use against existing potentially exercisable options.
Directors' share options
Certain of the Directors have rights to acquire ordinary shares in the Company by the exercise of options.
The grants have been made subject to performance conditions based upon significant growth in revenue or profit
during a performance period. These conditions determine the percentage of the options granted that may be
exercised. Details of these options are set out below. No share options were granted, lapsed or exercised by
Directors during the year.
