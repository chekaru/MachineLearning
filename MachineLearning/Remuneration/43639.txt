 Report of the Remuneration Committee
Remuneration
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on the Company's framework for executive and senior staff
remuneration and its cost. The Committee determines and approves on behalf of the Board any contract of
employment or related contract with executive directors or senior staff and agrees any termination arrangements in
the event of early termination. The Committee also makes recommendations to the Board on the Company's overall
limits and policies for share option schemes and other share-related and long term incentive schemes.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee is David Mann and committee members are Cliff Preddy and Mark
Wells. The Remuneration Committee meets as necessary, but at least twice a year.
The objective of the Remuneration Committee is to ensure that executive directors receive compensation which is
appropriate to their responsibilities and performance and which will attract, motivate and retain executives of the right
calibre. The comparator group for remuneration purposes comprises companies and partnerships in the consultancy
and IT fields matched to Charteris by reference to sectors and size characteristics of the business.
The Executive Directors have base remuneration packages that are primarily determined by the time expected to be
spent on business development and general management of the Company. In addition, they are paid bonuses which
are dependent upon the financial performance of the Company and/or individual time billed to consultancy clients. 
Remuneration for the Non-Executive Directors consists of their directors' fees.

Service Agreements and Letters of Appointment
Each of the Executive Directors has a rolling service agreement that may be terminated by either party giving six
months' notice. The agreements with the Non-Executive Directors may be terminated with six months' notice given by
either party in the case of Cliff Preddy and David Mann and three months' notice by either party in the case of Mark
Wells.
Share Option Schemes
In October 2010, two of the Company's share option schemes (the Unapproved Scheme and the EMI Scheme) came
to the end of the ten-year period that was approved by shareholders for their operation. Accordingly the Board plans
to make proposals to shareholders in 2011 concerning the adoption of new share schemes. It has not considered it
necessary to do so immediately because it is still able to grant share options under the Approved Scheme which
operates until November 2011. It has also been advised that, as an AIM Company, it is able to grant EMI options
without explicit shareholder approval if it considers that in the best interest of shareholders. If it does so in the interim
period prior to the submission of new proposals, it will regard itself as bound by the need to impose financial targets
as specified in the EMI Scheme and by the dilution limit for all share schemes that is defined in the Approved
Scheme, i.e. 15%.

EMI Scheme
The Company adopted an Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme on 24 October 2000. Financial targets may be
imposed that must be satisfied before any options granted can be exercised. At 31 July 2010, options over 6,008,700
shares remained exercisable or potentially exercisable under this scheme.
Unapproved Scheme
The Company adopted an Unapproved Scheme on 24 October 2000. Financial targets may be imposed that must be
satisfied before any option granted can be exercised. At 31 July 2010, options over 1,200 shares remained potentially
exercisable under this scheme.
Approved Scheme
The Company adopted an Approved Share Option Scheme on 21 November 2001. The Company may issue share
options under this scheme to its employees within the prescribed limits of  30,000, or four times the employee's
salary, whichever is the lower. Options will not be exercisable within three years or after ten years from the date of
grant. At 31 July 2010, options over 81,000 shares remained potentially exercisable under this scheme.
General Employee Benefit Trust
At key points in the development of Charteris, the Directors have felt it appropriate to establish special incentives for
key members of management, sales staff and team members. In such cases, whenever possible, they have sought to
match the associated option grants with existing shares held by a General Employee Benefit Trust (the  Trust') that
was established in March 2000. The EMI options linked to shares held by the Trust are included in the total for the
EMI Scheme disclosed above. At 31 July 2010 the Trust held 2,316,881 shares (2009: 2,316,881) of which 2,236,700
(2009: 2,263,700) are reserved for use against existing, potentially exercisable options.
Directors' Share Options
Certain of the Directors have rights to acquire ordinary shares in the Company by the exercise of options. The grants
have been made subject to performance conditions based upon significant growth in revenue or profit during a
performance period. These conditions determine the percentage of the options granted that may be exercised. Details
of these options are set out below. No share options were exercised by directors during the year.
