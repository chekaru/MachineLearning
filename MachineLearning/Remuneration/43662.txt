BOARD REPORT ON REMUNERATION
18
As stated in the Corporate Governance Report on page 12,
the Remuneration Committee is currently composed of three
non-executive directors. The Committee members have no
personal interest in the matters to be decided.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Committee reviews the Company's policy for the
remuneration of the executive directors and makes
recommendations to the Board.
The Committee's aim is to consider aspects of remuneration
policy which enables the Company to recruit, retain
and motivate executive directors of appropriate calibre
for the long term development of the Group. The policy
is to pay individual directors remuneration at market levels for
comparable jobs recognising their experience, the size
of the Group and the business sector in which it operates.
Remuneration includes management salaries and bonus,
fees as directors, pension contributions to a money
purchase scheme and taxable benefits. Taxable benefits
mainly comprise the provision of a company car and
private medical, permanent health and death in service
insurance. The remuneration of the executive directors is
subject to annual review.
Non-executive directors are paid an annual fee which is set by
the Board as a whole.Where additional services are provided,
such as chairing Board Committees, an additional fee is paid.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for pension
contributions and do not participate in any of the Group's
bonus or benefits schemes.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
The terms of each of the executive directors' contracts include
the following:
David Cook's agreement can be terminated by either party
giving not less than 12 months' notice to the other. In addition
to the provisions in his service agreement, upon a change
of control, in certain circumstances, he is entitled to a payment
of  60,000.
Paul Mitchell's and Peter Cashman's agreements can be
terminated by either party giving not less than 12 months'
notice to the other.
The non-executive directors do not have service agreements
with the Company. The Company has entered into an
agreement with Peter Catesby appointing him as non-
executive chairman and this appointment is terminable on six
months' notice by either party.The Company has entered into
agreements with Messrs Hankinson, Prager, Platt and Wong
appointing them as non-executive directors and these
appointments are terminable on three months' notice by
either party.
INCENTIVE SCHEMES
Your Board believes that employees should be encouraged to
participate in any further improvement in the performance of
the Group over the longer term and this can best be achieved
by encouraging employees to hold shares in the Company.
The non-executive directors are not entitled to participate in
any of the schemes. The granting of share options to executive
directors is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The Company has a 1996 Share Option Plan and a 1996
Executive Share Option Scheme that were open to executive
directors and senior management and a 1996 Savings Related
Share Option Scheme that was open to all staff.The Share
Option Plan and the Savings Related Scheme were approved
by the Inland Revenue. For details of the related performance
criteria, see pages 19 to 22.
During 2005 the Committee reviewed the share incentive
arrangements of the Group and, in particular, of the executive
directors and other senior managers. The Committee
considers that it is important that the interests of the
executive directors are aligned with those of shareholders and
that the executive directors are incentivised to build the value
of the Group over the medium to long term. Consequently, at
the 2005 AGM, it sought and obtained the approval of
shareholders for the adoption of the 2005 Long Term
Incentive Plan (the LTIP), participation in which will initially be
limited to the executive directors and the company secretary.
The LTIP will deliver benefits to participants in the form of
either an option to subscribe for Ordinary Shares at nominal
value or a conditional right to receive Ordinary Shares. The
awards will normally vest over a period of three to five years,
provided there has been sustained and significant
improvement in the Group's financial performance over the
corresponding period. CHE HOTEL GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2005
BOARD REPORT ON REMUNERATION Continued
19
Participants in the LTIP will continue to be eligible to participate
in the share option schemes operated by the Group. However,
it is not intended that any participant will, in normal
circumstances, be awarded both an award under the LTIP and
an option under the Company Share Option Plan (as referred
to in more detail below) in the same financial year. Moreover,
the individual limits applying under both the LTIP and the
CSOP apply to the aggregate of shares subject to both plans.
As part of the review referred to above, the Committee also
decided that it was appropriate to renew the Group's
discretionary share option schemes, which were due to expire
in 2006. In accordance with current market practice, the new
arrangements for management are contained within a single
scheme, the CHE Hotel Group PLC 2005 Company Share
Option Plan (CSOP), which will be part Inland Revenue
approved and part not so approved. Subject to that and to the
application of a revised individual limit (which brings the
Group's arrangements in this regard into line with market
practice), the terms of the CSOP substantially replicate those
under the previous existing schemes. No further options will
be granted under the previous existing schemes following
adoption of the CSOP .
As a further part of the review referred to above, the
Committee decided that it was appropriate to renew the
Group's Inland Revenue approved savings-related share
option scheme in the form of the CHE Hotel Group PLC
2005 Savings Related Share Option Scheme (SAYE Scheme).
The terms of the SAYE Scheme will substantially replicate
those under the previous existing approved savings-related
share option scheme. No further options will be granted
under the previous existing scheme following adoption of the
SAYE Scheme.
Approval for the above schemes was sought and obtained
from shareholders at the 2005 Annual General Meeting.
PENSION ARRANGEMENTS 
The Company makes pension contributions to a money
purchase scheme in respect of the executive directors based
on a percentage of basic salary.
BONUS ARRANGEMENTS
The executive directors participate in a short term incentive
plan, which involves a payment of a bonus, if performance
targets are achieved after the payment of such bonus over the
relevant financial year and if the participant remains in
employment. Additionally there is a plan for senior
management.The maximum bonus payment is 50% of salary.

DIRECTORS' SHARE OPTIONS
PERFORMANCE GRAPH
The graphs shown below compare the total return on the
Company's shares with that of the FTSE UK All Share Travel
and Leisure - Total Return Index.The reason the Company
has chosen this particular index is that it is considered the
most likely benchmark by which the majority of 
shareholders would want to assess their investment in a
company of CHE Hotel Group PLC's size. While the graph
on the left covers the last five years, the graph on the right
which covers only the last year has also been included to
reflect the more recent trend.
i) Under the 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme
Options under this scheme were granted at an exercise price of not less than the market value of an ordinary share on
the dealing day immediately preceding the date of the grant and may be exercised when the Company's earnings per share
has achieved a specified growth in excess of the increase in the retail price index over the prior 3 year period. In relation
to one half of the shares subject to any option, the specified growth in earnings per share required is 2% per annum in
excess of the increase in the retail price index. In relation to a further one quarter of the shares subject to any option, the
specified growth required is 10% per annum in excess of the increase in the retail price index, while the last one quarter
of the shares subject to any option become exercisable on a straight-line basis in respect of growth between 10% and 20%
per annum in excess of the increase in the retail price index. Accordingly, the full amount of the shares subject to any
option will only become exercisable if the Company's earnings per share has achieved a growth in excess of 20% per
annum above the increase in the retail price index over the prior three year period.The maximum value of options granted
to an individual cannot exceed 4 times their annual salary. The above performance conditions have been chosen as
sufficiently challenging and yet achievable.
* Share price movement reflects the announcement in December to issue 48.8 additional shares at 41p per share.
The following disclosures (up to and including page 22) on directors' remuneration have been audited, as required by Part 3
of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.

v) Under the 2005 Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP ) 
The performance test to be applied is based on the Company's share price (adjusted to reflect dividends) over a period
of three to five years. One third of the total number of Ordinary Shares subject to an award will vest if the Company's
share price on the third anniversary of the date the award is made (adjusted to reflect dividends paid or declared during
that three year period) is equal to or exceeds 95p; a further third of the total number of Ordinary Shares subject to the
award will vest if the Company's share price on the fourth anniversary of the date the award is made (adjusted to reflect
dividends paid or declared during that four year period) is equal to or exceeds 110p; and the remaining third of the total
number of Ordinary Shares subject to the award will vest if the Company's share price on the fifth anniversary of the date
the award is made (adjusted to reflect dividends paid or declared during that five year period) is equal to or exceeds 125p.
