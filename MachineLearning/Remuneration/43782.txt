The actual number of share options granted represents the maximum number of options possible within the Scheme.  
Under the Scheme rules, the number of options granted is dependent on the actual EBITDA profit of the business as 
a percentage of the EBITDA profit first published by the brokers (Arbuthnot) in 2003 for the year ended 31 
December 2003.
