The actual number of share options granted represents the maximum number of options possible within the Scheme 
year.  Under the Scheme rules, the number of options granted is dependent on the actual EBTA profit of the business 
as a percentage of the EBTA profit first published by the Company's brokers in each year for the year ended 31 
December. 
 
 *  The number of share options granted and their Exercise Price has been adjusted by a factor of 100 to reflect the  
     100 to 1 share consolidation that was approved by shareholders at the Extra-Ordinary General Meeting of the  
     Company held on 28 October 2004.
