 This report sets out the information required by the
Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 
(the Regulations ).  As required by the Regulations, 
the Directors' Remuneration Report will be submitted to
shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting
on 20 March 2008.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
During the year under review the Remuneration Committee
comprised:
Mr I F R Much (Committee Chairman)
Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman
Mr K C Scobie
The Committee's principal responsibilities are:
  determining, agreeing with the Board and reviewing
from time to time the overall policy for the
remuneration of the Chairman, the executive directors,
the Company Secretary and certain other senior
executives in the Group, and their individual
remuneration packages and any changes thereto;
  approving the terms and conditions of employment, and
any changes thereto, of the executive directors; 
  approving any compensation payments for executive
directors;
  approving the design of, and determining targets for , any
performance-related pay schemes operated by the
Group;
  reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for
approval by the Board and the Company's shareholders;
and
  overseeing any major changes in employee benefits
structures across the Group.
None of the Committee members has any personal
financial interest in the matters reserved for the Committee
(other than the Chairman in respect of his own
remuneration; accordingly, he is not present during any
discussions relating to this matter), nor do they have any
conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships, and
they are not involved in the day to day running of the
Group's business.  Therefore, they are regarded by the
Board as independent.
The Committee met seven times during the year .  
The Chief Executive attends meetings by invitation but 
is not present during any discussions relating to his 
own remuneration. 
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on
the Company's website or on request from the Company
Secretary.
ADVISERS
During the year the Committee received advice on
remuneration matters from New Bridge Street 
Consultants LLP and Mercer Limited. Mercer Limited also
provided administration and actuarial services for the
Group's UK pension schemes during the year .
The Committee also consults internally with the 
Chief Executive and the Company Secretary.
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Committee's policy is to provide executive remuneration
packages which are competitive, but not excessive, by
reference to market rates across comparator companies,
reflect the performance of the business against financial
objectives, and which take into account the individual
contribution and performance of each executive director .
Remuneration packages comprise the following elements:
(i) basic salary and benefits, including pensions;
(ii) annual bonuses linked to the Group's financial
performance; and 
(iii)awards of share-based incentives linked to the long term
growth of the Group.
The Committee aims to align the interests of executive
directors with those of shareholders, by ensuring that a
significant proportion of remuneration is 
performance-related.  This is achieved through the
performance-related elements of annual bonuses and
share-based incentives.
BASIC SALARIES AND BENEFITS
The executive directors' basic salaries are reviewed
annually by the Committee, and adjustments made, if
appropriate, taking into account individual performance
and comparable salary levels in manufacturing companies
of a similar size and in other companies within the
aerospace and defence sector .  The Committee refers to
published salary surveys and data provided by its
remuneration advisers, New Bridge Street Consultants, and
also reviews the remuneration information presented in the
32 CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007
Directors' Renumeration Report annual reports of companies in the reference group. 
Following its review this year , the Committee increased
salaries for Dr Price and Mr Rayner to  350,000 per
annum and  220,000 per annum respectively. The
Committee considered that these increases were necessary
to retain a competitive remuneration package for key
executives as the Group continues to grow, although salary
levels remain below mid-market levels compared to
companies of a similar size following these adjustments. 
The main taxable benefits for executive directors are
company cars, fuel for private motoring and private
medical insurance.
ANNUAL BONUSES
The Company operates an annual performance-related
bonus plan for the executive directors, with key
characteristics as follows:
  the maximum bonus potential for the executive
directors is 60% of basic salary, with an on-target
bonus of 30% of basic salary;
  three quarters of the bonus potential is linked to two
separate financial conditions, namely earnings per share
and cash flow (with equal weighting). The conditions,
which are set by the Committee, take into account a
number of factors including budget, market
expectations, long term growth prospects and the
previous year's out-turn. No bonus is payable for
achievement of less than 90% of target, with bonuses
being earned thereafter on a straight-line basis up to
the maximum for 110% or better achievement of target;
  one quarter of the bonus potential may be achieved in
connection with the satisfaction of personal objective
criteria set at the beginning of the financial year . No
part of this element of bonus is payable unless
threshold performance of both the financial conditions
described above is achieved; 
  one quarter of any bonus payable is deferred as a
conditional award of the Company's shares, with vesting
subject to continued employment (save in good leaver
scenarios) three years from the award of bonus; and 
  the payment of any bonus remains ultimately at the
discretion of the Committee.
Bonuses are non-pensionable.
The table below summarises the bonuses earned by the
executive directors, as a percentage of basic salary, in
respect of the current and last years:
LONG TERM INCENTIVE SCHEMES
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN
The Company operates the Chemring Group Performance
Share Plan for the executive directors and other key
members of the senior management team who influence
the performance and prospects of the Group. The key
features of the plan are as follows:
  conditional awards can be made of the Company's shares
worth no more than 100% of basic salary each year;
  awards will vest three years after grant subject to the
extent to which a demanding performance condition has
been achieved over a single three year performance
period (with no ability to re-test the performance
condition). The performance condition is based on the
growth of the Company's earnings per share in excess
of RPI over three consecutive financial years.  The
Committee considers an earnings per share condition to
most closely align the interests of participants with
those of the Company's shareholders;

Directors' Renumeration Report
(CONTINUED)
  earnings per share is calculated on a fully diluted and
normalised basis, as specified by the Committee prior to
grant; and
  market purchase shares or new issue shares (including
treasury shares) may be used to satisfy awards. To the
extent that new issue shares or treasury shares are
used, these will count towards the usual share usage
dilution limits (10% in ten years for all schemes and 5%
in ten years for discretionary (executive) schemes).
Participation in the plan is extended at the discretion of the
Committee to the executive directors and senior management
of the Group, both in the UK and overseas. The following
awards were made under the plan during the year:
Details of the awards made to executive directors during
the year are set out on page 38. 
The executive directors are expected to maintain a
shareholding in the Company equivalent to one year's basic
salary. Other participants in the plan are expected to retain
a shareholding equivalent to 25% of their basic salary
following vesting of the awards.   
During the year , the Company purchased 150,000 
(2006: nil) treasury shares at a cost of  2.8 million for use
in the plan.

Between 1998 and 2005 the Company operated the
Chemring 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme.  Following
the introduction of the Chemring Group Performance Share
Plan, no further grants will be made under the option
scheme, save in exceptional circumstances such as on
recruitment, and the conditions applying to any such grants
will accord with current corporate governance best
practice. It will no longer be permissible to grant options
under this scheme after 4 March 2008.
The Company previously operated a long term incentive
scheme known as the Chemring Group PLC Share Based
Incentive Scheme.  This scheme is not being utilised at
present.  
PERFORMANCE GRAPH
The following graph shows a comparison of the Company's
total shareholder return (TSR) over the last five financial
years against a broad equity market index , as required by
the Regulations.  The FTSE 250 Index has been selected by
the Committee for this comparison because it provides the
most appropriate measure of performance of listed
companies of a similar size to the Company. 
PENSIONS
Dr Price is a member of the Chemring Group Staff Pension
Scheme (the Staff Scheme ).  This is an approved final
salary scheme, which is contracted out of the State Second
Pension, and which provides, at retirement, a pension of up
to two-thirds of salary, subject to Inland Revenue limits.
The Staff Scheme also provides life assurance cover ,
dependants' pensions and lump sum payments on 
death-in-service.  Members of the Staff Scheme are
required to make monthly contributions to the scheme at
the rate of 8% of pensionable salary.
Dr Price's pension under the Staff Scheme accrues at
1/80th of final pensionable salary for each year of
membership, and he also accrues a cash lump sum at
3/80ths of final pensionable salary for each year of
membership.  A two-thirds spouses' pension is payable in
respect of service accrued to 31 January 2004, reducing to
50% for service accrued thereafter , and on 
death-in-service, Dr Price's dependants would receive a
lump sum payment of two times basic salary and, in
addition a spouses' pension would be payable, as calculated
above.  Dr Price is subject to an earnings cap (equivalent to
the cap applied by HM Revenue and Customs prior to April
2006) in respect of his membership of the Staff Scheme.
Mr Rayner is a member of the Chemring Group Executive
Pension Scheme (the Executive Scheme ).  The Executive
Scheme is also an approved final salary scheme but is not

Value ( )
This graph shows the value, by 31 October 2007 , of  100 invested
in Chemring Group PLC on 31 October 2002 compared with the
value of  100 invested in the FTSE 250 Index. The other points
plotted are the values at intervening financial year ends. contracted out of the State Second Pension. Members of
the Executive Scheme are required to make monthly
contributions to the scheme at the rate of 8% of
pensionable salary.  Mr Rayner's benefits under the
Executive Scheme accrue in an identical manner to that in
which Dr Price accrues benefits under the Staff Scheme, as
set out above.  Mr Rayner is also subject to an earnings cap.
Both Dr Price and Mr Rayner have a normal retirement age
of 65.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
Dr Price has a rolling service contract dated 4 April 2005.
This provides for termination by either party on twelve
months' notice.  The Company may however terminate
without notice, and make a payment in lieu of notice equal
to the sum of the salary due for the unexpired notice
period plus the fair value of any contractual benefits.  Any
such sum may be paid in instalments, and in these
circumstances there is a requirement to mitigate loss.
Mr Rayner has a rolling service contract dated 
27 August 1999.  This provides for termination by either
party on twelve months' notice.  The Company may however
terminate without notice and make a payment in lieu of
notice equal to the sum of twelve months' salary plus the
value of any contractual benefits.  There are no other
provisions relating to compensation on early termination.
It is the Committee's general policy that all new executive
directors appointed in the future will have service contracts
with the Company which are terminable on a maximum of
twelve months' notice. The service contracts will contain
provisions permitting the Company to make any
termination payments by instalments, and will require
directors to mitigate their loss in such circumstances.
POLICY ON OUTSIDE APPOINTMENTS
With the specific approval of the Board in each case,
executive directors may accept external appointments as
non-executive directors of other companies, provided that
they do not detract from their responsibilities to the Group,
and may retain any related fees paid to them.  None of the
executive directors currently holds any such external
appointments.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Mr Scobie has a rolling service contract with the Company
terminable on twelve months' notice by either party.  His
remuneration under the contract, part of which is paid to his
company for consultancy services, is  100,000 per annum.
His time commitment under the contract is two to four days
per month, not to exceed a total of fifty days per year .
Additional services are paid for at the rate of  1,000 per day. 
Mr Evans, The Rt Hon Lord Freeman, Mr Much and 
Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss have letters of appointment
covering, amongst other items, their terms of appointment
and expected time commitment. These letters of
appointment provide for a three year appointment, unless
terminated earlier by and at the discretion of either party
upon three months' written notice. In the case of 
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman, Mr Much and 
Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss, it is anticipated that, subject to
satisfactory performance and re-election by the
shareholders, two three-year terms will be served by these
non-executive directors.  The basic fee payable to each of the
four non-executive directors is  35,000 per annum. 
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman and Mr Much each receive an
additional fee of  4,500 per annum, in respect of their
Chairmanship of the Audit Committee and Remuneration
Committee respectively.
Fees for the non-executive directors are determined
annually by the Board, having regard to the practice of
other companies and the particular demands of the Group.
The Company provides private medical insurance for 
Mr Scobie, Mr Evans and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss, 
and their respective spouses.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the
Company's pension, bonus or share-based incentive
schemes. However , Mr Evans does receive a pension from
the Chemring Group Executive Pension Scheme, which he
accrued during his former employment with the Company.
In addition, a long term incentive scheme, known as The
Chemring Group Phantom Share Option Scheme, was
established in 1997 to secure the appointment of Mr Scobie
as Chairman at a difficult time when the Group was
undergoing a fundamental reorganisation.  Mr Scobie, who
was the only participant in the scheme, acquired a
contractual entitlement on his appointment in 1997 to the
grant of phantom options over 141,025 ordinary shares in
the Company at a notional exercise price of 78p per share.
Mr Scobie exercised his rights under this scheme on 
31 October 2007 and received a cash payment from the
Company in November 2007 of  3,008,063 (gross), being
equivalent to the difference between the market value of
the ordinary shares on the exercise date (2,211p) less the
total exercise price. No further awards will be made under
this scheme.
