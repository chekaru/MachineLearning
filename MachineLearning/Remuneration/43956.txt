Directors' remuneration report
for the year ended 31 October 2012
Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
Dear shareholder
The past eighteen months have been extremely challenging for the Company, as continuing pressure on defence spending has 
resulted in increasingly uncertain prospects within the sector. The Board has also had to address the uncertainty caused by a third 
party approach for the Group, and the departure of David Price from the role of Chief Executive and Paul Rayner from the role of 
Finance Director. The Remuneration Committee has had to determine their termination arrangements, as well as the remuneration 
arrangements for the new Chief Executive and Finance Director.
Against this backdrop, the Remuneration Committee has needed to ensure that its remuneration policy is capable of appropriately 
rewarding and incentivising the revised senior management team to deliver improved performance. It has also taken account of the 
forthcoming changes to remuneration reporting announced by the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and has sought 
to incorporate many of these early, in this year's remuneration report.
The Committee's basic policy remains to provide executive remuneration packages which are competitive, but not excessive, by 
reference to market rates across comparator companies. These take into account the individual contribution and performance of 
each executive, and reflect the performance of the business against financial objectives. The Committee also remains conscious of its 
responsibility to ensure that remuneration appropriately aligns executive and shareholder interests.
Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee has made the following decisions in respect of 2012 and 2013:
  Mark Papworth and Steve Bowers have joined the Company on salaries that are below the level of their predecessors. Their next 
review will take place in early 2014.
  As in 2011, no bonuses will be paid to executive directors in respect of 2012.
  The Performance Share Plan awards which could have vested on 20 January 2013 have lapsed, as the threshold level of earnings 
per share growth has not been achieved. 
  David Price and Paul Rayner received termination payments that were consistent with their contracts, namely the payment of one 
times annual salary plus benefits. Their deferred share awards, which were made in connection with their annual bonuses for 2009 
and 2010, were also allowed to vest. Dr Price's and Mr Rayner's other long term incentive awards lapsed. 
  The structure of the annual bonus remains largely unchanged for 2013, with 40% of any award deferred in shares for three years 
and subject to claw-back. The maximum annual bonus will be 125% of salary for Mr Papworth and 100% of salary for the other 
executive directors. 
  The Committee has reviewed the weighting of the financial and personal objectives in the annual bonus plan, and has increased 
the weighting on personal objectives for 2013 in recognition of the need to focus on key strategic and operational goals, given the 
ongoing review of the strategy. 
  At the time of negotiating Mr Papworth's remuneration package, there was a high probability that a bid for the Company would be 
forthcoming, and that a new owner might not wish to maintain his employment. Therefore, it was agreed with him that we would 
include some additional elements in his package that would protect him in this eventuality. A change of control clause was agreed, 
which provides that, in the event of a change of control of the Company during the first twelve months of his employment, which 
results in the termination of his employment within a six month period thereafter, he will receive a lump sum payment of twelve 
months' salary in lieu of notice and a guaranteed bonus, pro-rated for that proportion of the year during which he is employed. 
This provision falls away after the first twelve months of his employment. 
  In addition, in order to provide an immediate alignment with shareholders, the Committee decided to award Mr Papworth 
performance shares worth 200% of his annual salary. The Committee is aware that the priority of many shareholders is to see a 
significant increase in the share price, and we therefore decided to set a performance condition which was linked directly to such 
a result. The award will vest in full if the share price reaches 500p at the end of the three year vesting period. This represents an 
increase of 130% over the share price at the time of grant. 
  The Committee also intends to use a performance condition based on share price growth for the performance share plan awards 
to be made to other senior executives in early 2013. If the full vesting share price of 500p for these awards is achieved, the 
Company's market capitalisation will have increased by over  394 million since the date of this report.
  The change in strategy and appointment of a new Chief Executive and Finance Director mean that it is an appropriate time 
to review the remuneration policy for executive directors. The Committee intends to conduct a fundamental review of its 
remuneration policy during 2013. If the Committee proposes to make substantive changes to the executive directors' remuneration 
policy, it will, as part of the review process, consult with shareholders and will report back on the outcome in next year's report 
and accounts.

Introduction 
This report sets out the information required by Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008. The report also satisfies the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, 
and describes how the Board has applied the principles and complied with the provisions relating to directors' remuneration in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. In preparing this year's report, the Committee has paid regard to the new reporting requirements 
announced by the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills that will come into force with effect from next year's report and 
accounts, and has sought to adopt a number of the new requirements where it is practical to do so whilst still remaining compliant with 
the existing Regulations. This year's report consists of two sections: a remuneration policy section, which describes the Company's 
policy for the remuneration of executive and non-executive directors for the coming year and which is not subject to audit, and an 
implementation section, subject to audit, which provides details of the directors' emoluments, shareholdings, long term incentive awards 
and pensions for the year ended 31 October 2012.
In accordance with the Regulations, a resolution inviting shareholders to approve the directors' remuneration report will be put to the 
Annual General Meeting on 20 March 2013.

Remuneration policy section 
General policy
The aim of the remuneration policy is to enable the Company to offer a package of rewards that is aligned with the strategy for the 
business by:
  being competitive but not excessive by reference to market rates across comparator companies;
  taking into account the individual contribution and performance of each executive;
  reflecting the performance of the business against financial objectives; and
  aligning the interests of executives with shareholders, by ensuring that a significant proportion of remuneration is performance-related 
and delivered in shares.
Directors' remuneration report

Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Other information
The Committee aims to align the interests of executive directors and senior executives with those of shareholders, by ensuring that  
a significant proportion of remuneration is performance-related. This is achieved through the performance-related elements of the 
annual bonus and share-based incentives.
The Committee reviews the policy annually in light of market conditions, performance and developments in corporate governance  
best practice.
The Company's policy is that a substantial proportion of an executive's remuneration should be performance-related and delivered  
in shares, which executives are required to hold under the Company's share ownership guidelines.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors and senior management:
  base salary;
  benefits;
  pension arrangements;
  annual bonus; and
  long term incentives.

Notes
1.  The target and maximum vesting for the Chief Executive's annual bonus is 62.5% and 125% of salary respectively, and 50% and 100% for the other executive directors.
2.  For performance share awards, the target and maximum vesting is 50% and 200% of salary for the Chief Executive, and 37.5% and 150% of salary for the other  
executive directors. 
3. Pension provision is 20% of salary for each director.
4. The value of other benefits is assumed to be  22,000 for each director.
How employees' pay is taken into account
The Committee also considers and approves the base salaries for approximately thirty other senior executives, and reviews salaries for 
the next tier of management at each of the Group's businesses. In addition, the Committee receives information on general pay levels 
across the Group. The Committee, therefore, has due regard to salary levels across the Group in applying its remuneration policy.
How executive directors' remuneration policy relates to the wider Group
The remuneration policy described above provides an overview of the structure that operates for the most senior executives in the Group. 
Lower aggregate incentive quantum operates at below executive level, with levels driven by market comparatives and the impact of the role. 
Employees are provided with a competitive package of benefits that includes participation in the Group's defined contribution 
pension arrangements.
Long term incentives are provided to the most senior executives and those anticipated as having the greatest potential to influence 
performance levels within the Company. However, in order to encourage wider employee share ownership, the Company operates a 
Sharesave Plan in the UK and a Stock Purchase Plan in the US, in which all UK and US employees are eligible to participate on completion 
of six months' service.
How shareholders views are taken into account
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the Annual General Meeting each year and guidance 
from shareholder representative bodies more generally. Shareholders' views are key inputs when shaping remuneration policy. 
During the year, the Committee engaged with its largest shareholders regarding the policy for 2012, including the choice and weighting 
of annual bonus performance targets and the earnings per share performance conditions for the performance share awards made in 
January 2012. Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2012
39
Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Other information
Planned application of the policy for 2013
Base salary and benefits
The executive directors' base salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee, and adjustments made, if appropriate, taking into account 
individual performance and comparable salary levels in relevant comparator companies. The Committee refers to published salary 
surveys and data provided by its remuneration advisers, New Bridge Street, and also reviews the remuneration information presented in 
the annual reports of companies in comparator groups. 
Factors that are considered during the annual review of base salary and benefits include: 
  reference to market rates across comparator companies (those of similar size to Chemring or within the same sector); 
  individual contribution and performance of each executive; and
  pay levels across the Group.
Mrs Ellard's basic salary was increased to  210,000 p.a. with effect from 1 January 2013. This increase is consistent with the general  
level of increases awarded to other employees of the Group (up to 5%).
Benefits consist of a fully-expensed company car or car allowance, life assurance and private medical insurance. 
Pension
Mrs Ellard was a member of the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme (the Staff Scheme ) until 6 April 2010. This is an approved final 
salary scheme, which is contracted-out of the State Second Pension, and which provides, at retirement, a pension of up to two-thirds of 
salary, subject to HM Revenue & Customs limits. The pension arrangements for the executive directors under the Staff Scheme (1/80ths 
accrual rate only as far as the notional earnings cap) were well below market norms. As a result, the Committee agreed that, with effect 
from 6 April 2010, the executive directors would cease to participate in the Staff Scheme, and would instead, for all future service, receive 
a salary supplement of 20% of base salary. Mrs Ellard therefore now receives a salary supplement of 20% of her prevailing base salary in 
lieu of membership of the Group's occupational pension scheme, as does Mr Papworth and Mr Bowers.
Annual bonus 
The annual bonus plan provides the framework for an annual incentive for executive directors and eligible senior managers, with the aim 
of promoting the achievement of the corporate strategy and success of the Group. 
The maximum bonus award is capped at 125% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 100% for other executive directors. 40% of any 
bonus payable is deferred as a conditional award of the Company's shares, vesting of which is subject to continued employment (save in 
good leaver scenarios) three years from the award of the bonus. Bonuses are not pensionable.  
The Committee has consistently set highly challenging bonus targets for the achievement of maximum bonuses. No bonuses have been paid 
to the executive directors in the last two years, and the executive directors did not receive maximum bonuses in any of the prior three years.
For 2013, the Committee has set equally challenging targets but has increased the weighting on personal objectives, reflecting the 
importance of delivering key strategic and operational goals in the current year, given the ongoing review of the strategy. For the 
executive directors, earnings per share and cash flow will therefore each account for 30% of the total bonus opportunity, with personal 
objectives accounting for 40%. When determining performance against the personal objectives, the Remuneration Committee will have 
discretion to reduce, potentially to zero, the payout in respect of the personal objectives element taking account of the Group's underlying 
financial performance. The increase in the weighting on personal objectives is intended to be exceptional, and the Committee intends to 
return to a more significant weighting on financial objectives for 2014. 
Long term incentives
The Company operates the Chemring Group Performance Share Plan for the executive directors and other key members of the senior 
management team who influence the performance and prospects of the Group. Conditional awards of the Company's shares can potentially 
be made at a value of up to 150% of base salary each year under normal circumstances, with awards of up to 200% of salary in exceptional 
circumstances. Awards vest three years after grant, subject to the extent to which a demanding performance condition has been achieved over 
a single three year performance period. The vesting schedules for the awards granted to date, and which remain outstanding, are as follows:

executive directors
Total earnings per share growth per annum (not compound) over three financial years

Directors' remuneration report
continued
An award of performance shares worth 200% of salary was made to Mr Papworth on 21 November 2012. The aim of the award was  
to ensure an immediate interest in the Company's performance and alignment with its shareholders, and was agreed as part of 
Mr Papworth's recruitment package. This award was made under the exceptional circumstances provisions of the Group's Performance 
Share Plan. No further awards will be made to him in the current financial year. Vesting of the awards is subject to the achievement of 
demanding targets linked to growth in the Company's share price over three financial years beginning with the current year, as follows:
Average share price over the three month period from 1 August 2015 to 31 October 2015 Percentage of the award vesting
Less than 275p Nil
275p (approximately 26% above the Company's share price  
on the date of grant) 25%
500p or above (approximately 130% above the Company's share price  
on the date of grant) 100%
Between 275p and 500p Pro-rata between 25% and 100% on a straight-line basis
In addition, this award will be subject to the Company's clawback arrangements which apply to all awards made under the Performance 
Share Plan from 2011 onwards. These enable the Company to claw back awards prior to vesting in the event of subsequent discovery of 
material misstatement of the Company's financial results, and after having first clawed back any unvested deferred shares awarded as 
part of the annual bonus for the financial year in which the results were misstated.
The Committee has historically set highly challenging earnings per share targets, reflecting the Board's confidence in the strong growth 
prospects for the Group but also the Committee's firm commitment to align the interests of shareholders with the executive management 
through the use of significant levels of potential variable pay triggered by exceptional levels of performance. 
In considering the performance condition for awards which will be made in 2013, the Committee has remained consistent with its 
commitment to tough target setting. However, with defence budgets around the world continuing to be under significant pressure and 
given that the new senior management team is conducting an ongoing review of the Group's operations, it is difficult to set robust 
earnings per share performance targets for the next three years. Earnings per share is not therefore felt to be an appropriate measure 
at the current time, and the long term incentives granted to other senior executives in early 2013 will also be subject to a performance 
condition based on the share price growth as set out below:
Average share price over the three month period from 1 August 2015 to 31 October 2015 Percentage of the award vesting
Less than 350p Nil
350p (approximately 18% above the Company's share price  
on the date of this report) 25%
500p or above (approximately 69% above the Company's share price  
on the date of this report) 100%
Between 350p and 500p Pro-rata between 25% and 100% on a straight-line basis
The Committee believes that the adoption of this performance condition will ensure that the Company's senior executives are 
appropriately aligned with one another and incentivised to achieving an improvement in the Group's share price. However, the Committee 
intends to review the performance measures used in the Performance Share Plan going forward, and will consider reintroducing a 
financial measure such as earnings per share for future awards.
Shareholding guidelines
Over a five year period following appointment, executive directors are expected to build-up and maintain a shareholding in the Company 
equivalent to one year's basic salary. Other participants in the Performance Share Plan are expected to build-up a shareholding 
equivalent to 25% to 50% of their basic salary over a five year period.
Other schemes
The Company operates all-employee savings-related share schemes in the UK (The Chemring Group 2008 UK Sharesave Plan), in which 
executive directors can participate, and in the US (The Chemring Group 2008 US Stock Purchase Plan). There are no performance criteria 
for these arrangements, and options are issued to all participants in accordance with UK HM Revenue & Customs and US Internal Revenue 
Service regulations.
The Company complies with the dilution guidelines contained within the ABI Principles of Remuneration . At 31 October 2012, awards

Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2012

It is the Committee's general policy that all new executive directors appointed will have service contracts with the Company which are 
terminable on a maximum of twelve months' notice. Service contracts should contain provisions permitting the Company to make any 
termination payments by instalments, and should require directors to mitigate their loss in such circumstances.
The Committee is aware of investors' views and current best practice guidelines regarding change of control provisions, and its normal 
policy would be not to include such provisions in directors' contracts. However, Mr Papworth was recruited at a time when it was known 
that the Company was in discussions with a potential acquirer, and the Committee confirms that the change of control provision was 
necessary to secure his appointment at a time of considerable uncertainty.
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors do not receive compensation for loss of office, but are appointed for fixed terms of three years, renewable for 
further three year terms if both parties agree and subject to annual re-election by shareholders. Mr Hickson's appointment may be 
terminated on six months' notice by either party. The other non-executive directors' appointments may be terminated by either party 
upon three months' written notice. Non-executive directors do not participate in the Company's pension, bonus or share-based incentive 
schemes. The Company provides private medical insurance for Mr Hickson and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss, and their respective 
spouses. The following table shows details of the terms of appointment for the non-executive directors:
Name Date original term commenced Date current term commenced Expected expiry date of current term

Mrs V Murray 1 November 2011 1 November 2011 31 October 2014
Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss 1 May 2004 1 May 2010 20 March 2013
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Chairman and the executive members of the Board, and the 
remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Committee. Fees for the non-executive directors and the Chairman are reviewed from 
time to time with regard to time commitment required and the level of fees paid by comparable companies. Current annual fee levels for 
the non-executive directors are as follows:

Details of variable pay earned in the year
Annual bonus plan
For 2012, three quarters of the bonus potential was linked to two separate financial performance conditions, namely earnings per share 
and cash flow (with equal weighting). No bonus was payable for achievement of less than 90% of target, with bonuses being earned 
thereafter on a straight-line basis up to the maximum for 110% or better achievement of target. One quarter of the bonus potential may 
be achieved in connection with satisfaction of personal objective criteria set out at the beginning of the year. 
The payment of any bonus ultimately remains at the discretion of the Committee. In the year the Committee did not use its discretion.

Directors' shareholdings
To reinforce the linkage between senior executives and shareholders, the Committee has adopted a shareholding policy that applies to 
executive directors and other participants in the Performance Share Plan. Executive directors are expected to build-up, over a five year 
period following appointment, and maintain a shareholding in the Company equivalent to one year's basic salary. Other participants in the 
Performance Share Plan are expected to retain a shareholding equivalent to 25% to 50% of their basic salary over a five year period.
The interests of the directors in the ordinary shares of the Company at 1 November 2011 and 31 October 2012 are shown below. All are 
beneficial holdings.
