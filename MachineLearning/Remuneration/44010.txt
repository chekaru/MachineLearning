 DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
COMPOSITION & FUNCTION
The members of the committee prior to the acquisition of Northern Racing Limited were Paul Twamley and John Deer.  Following the
acquisition, the remuneration committee comprises Graham Stow (Chairman), Stephen Jones and Jane Gerard-Pearse. Graham Stow is
an independent director of the Company. 
The Committee considers all aspects of the executive directors' remuneration and administers the Company's Share Option Scheme.  The
remuneration of the non-executive directors is considered by the board, following recommendations by the executive directors.  No
director participates in setting his own remuneration.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Company's policy on executive remuneration is to ensure that it has an appropriate mix of fixed and variable pay to attract, retain and
motivate senior executives with an appropriate blend of skills and experience, contributing to the delivery of long term shareholder value.
The policy requires the highest level of performance from executives. Pay levels take into account both individual performance and
competitive market practice, which is established through regular benchmarking against similar roles in companies of comparable size and
complexity.
Independent professional advice has been sought from Watson Wyatt LLP in December 2003, to assist the benchmarking process and to
ensure that the policy remains appropriate.
The Company's focus is on the following elements of the remuneration package.
BASIC SALARY
Basic salary, which is reviewed annually for each director is determined by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account performance
of the individual, together with experience and responsibilities.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
The contracts of service for the executive directors are terminable by the Company on periods of notice of six months or less.
The non-executive directors have a formal engagement letter and are appointed for an initial period of three years.
INCENTIVE SCHEMES - ANNUAL BONUS
Executive directors, excluding the Chairman, participate in a performance linked annual bonus scheme. The levels of bonus are
determined by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account Company performance against budget and personal targets.
The current executive directors are eligible to receive a maximum bonus of up to 30% of basic salary in 2003, which will increase to 50% in
2004.
SHARE OPTIONS
The Company believes that share ownership strengthens the link between personal interests and those of shareholders and encourages
long-term improvement in the Company's performance. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for supervising the Company's
Executive Share Option Scheme.
The exercise of options is dependent upon the Company's earnings per share increasing by more than the retail prices index plus 5% per
annum compounded over five years.
Presently only the executive directors are members of the scheme.
