 Remuneration Committee
The remuneration committee comprises:
P Wardle -Non-executive Chairman
J F Dawson -Independent Non-executive Director
W P Taylor -Executive Director
There were no changes in the composition of the committee during the year.
The committee makes recommendations to the Board and no Director plays a part in any discussions
about his own remuneration.
Remuneration Policy
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of
the highest calibre. There are four main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors:-
  Basic annual salary
An Executive Director's basic salary is determined on an annual basis and when an individual
changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels the committee considers the individual's performance and ability
and the group's overall short and medium term strategies.
In addition to basic salary the Executive Directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, principally a car
and private medical insurance.
  Annual bonus payments
No bonus payments were made for the year ended 31 December 2003. The remuneration committee
has established a scheme for 2004 where any cash bonuses paid will be tied to overall profitability
of the Group and share price performance.
  Share options
The Company has an Inland Revenue approved Executive share option scheme by which certain
Directors are able to subscribe for shares in Chieftain Group plc. With effect from 29 June 1998
no new share options may be issued.
The Company currently has no plans to introduce any other long term incentive schemes.
  Pension arrangements
Executive Directors are members of the Company's defined contribution pension scheme. The
Company's contribution to the scheme is 9% of salary for all members.
Director's Contracts
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors should have contracts providing for a maximum of
one year's notice.
The service contract of Mr Elliott provides for a notice period of twenty four months and, in the event
of a change in control, a bonus payment of a sum equal to his annual salary. It is considered that this
will motivate Mr Elliott to stay with the Company and commit himself to the Company's business.
Details of the Directors' contracts are summarised in the table below:
Date of Contract Notice Period
W P Taylor 1 December 1997 12 months
S Elliott 1 December 1997 24 months
L G Adams 11 July 2003 6 months
A W Cutchie 11 July 2003 6 months
R Johnson 11 July 2003 6 months
In the event of an early termination the Directors' contracts provide for compensation comprising
basic salary and a value of benefits as quoted in the last audited accounts. In the case of Mr Taylor
and Mr Elliott they also provide for a payment into the pension scheme equivalent to that which would
have been made had early termination not occurred.
Non-executive Directors
There are currently 2 Non-executive Directors. Mr P Wardle was appointed Non-executive Chairman
on 6 April 2000 and is entitled to 12 months notice of termination. Mr J F Dawson was appointed
on 19 January 1995 and is entitled to 3 months notice of termination. Their remuneration is determined
by the Board.
