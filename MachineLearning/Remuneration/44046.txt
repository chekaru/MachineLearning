 Remuneration Committee
This part of the Directors' Remuneration Report is unaudited as it is not the requirement of an AIM
listed company.
The Remuneration Committee comprises:
P Wardle -Non-executive Chairman
J F Dawson -Non-executive Director
C J Fleetwood -Senior Independent Non-executive Director
W P Taylor -Executive Director
The committee makes recommendations to the Board and no Director plays a part in any discussions
about his own remuneration.
Remuneration Policy
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of
the highest calibre. There are four main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors:-
  Basic annual salary
An Executive Director's basic salary is determined on an annual basis and when an individual
changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels the committee considers the individual's performance and ability
and the Group's overall short and medium term strategies.
In addition to basic salary the Executive Directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, principally a car
and private medical insurance.
  Annual bonus payments
The Company has a bonus scheme in place based on the achieved profit before tax and the share
price performance. Any bonus generated by the scheme is shared equally amongst all Executive
Directors. Any such payments made are not pensionable. During 2005 each Executive Director
was awarded a bonus of  5,000.
The bonus scheme will be discontinued if the Executive Share Incentive Scheme referred to below
is accepted.
  Share options
The Company has an Inland Revenue approved Executive share option scheme by which certain
Directors are able to subscribe for shares in Chieftain Group plc. With effect from 29 June 1998
no new share options may be issued.
  Executive Share Incentive Scheme.
The Company intends to propose the implementation of an Executive Share Incentive Scheme at
an Extraordinary General Meeting.
  Pension arrangements
Executive Directors and the Non-executive Chairman are members of the Company's defined
contribution pension scheme. The Company's contribution to the scheme is 9% of salary for all
members.
Executive Directors' Contracts
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors should have contracts providing for a maximum of
one year's notice.
The service contract of Mr Elliott provides for a notice period of twenty four months and, in the event
of a change in control, a bonus payment of a sum equal to his annual salary. It is considered that this
will motivate Mr Elliott to stay with the Company and commit himself to the Company's business.
Details of the Directors' contracts are summarised in the table below:
Date of Contract Notice Period
W P Taylor 1 December 1997 12 months
S Elliott 1 December 1997 24 months
L G Adams 11 July 2003 12 months
A W Cutchie 11 July 2003 12 months
R Johnson 11 July 2003 12 months
M W Oliver 14 February 2005 12 months
In the event of an early termination the Directors' contracts provide for compensation comprising basic
salary and a value of benefits as quoted in the last audited accounts. In the case of Mr Taylor and Mr
Elliott they also provide for a payment into the pension scheme equivalent to that which would have
been earned in the notice period.
