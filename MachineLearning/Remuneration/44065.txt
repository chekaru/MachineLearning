 Directors' Remuneration Report
for the year ended 31 December 2007
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises:
P Wardle -Non-executive Chairman
J F Dawson -Non-executive Director
C J Fleetwood -Senior Independent Non-executive Director
W P Taylor -Executive Director
The committee makes recommendations to the Board and no Director plays a part in any discussions
about his own remuneration.
Remuneration Policy
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of
the highest calibre. There are four main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors:-
  Basic annual salary
An Executive Director's basic salary is determined on an annual basis and when an individual
changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels the committee considers the individual's performance and ability
and the Group's overall short and medium term strategies.
In addition to basic salary the Executive Directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, principally a car
and private medical insurance.
  Annual bonus payments
During 2007 each Executive Director was awarded a discretionary bonus of  5,000 (2006  2,000)
which was not pensionable.
  Share options
The Company has an Executive Share Incentive Scheme by which the Executive Directors are able
to subscribe for shares in Chieftain Group plc (Note 19).
  Pension arrangements
Executive Directors and the Non-executive Chairman are members of the Company's defined
contribution pension scheme. The Company's contribution to the scheme is 9% of salary.
Executive Directors' Contracts
It is the Company's policy that Executive Directors should have contracts providing for a maximum of
one year's notice. The service contract of Mr Elliott provides for a notice period of twenty four months
and, in the event of a change in control, a bonus payment of a sum equal to his annual salary. It is
considered that this will motivate Mr Elliott to stay with the Company and commit himself to the
Company's business. 
Details of the Directors' contracts are summarised in the table below:
Date of contract Notice period
----------- -----------
W P Taylor 1 December 1997 12 months
S Elliott 1 December 1997 24 months
L G Adams 11 July 2003 12 months
A W Cutchie 11 July 2003 12 months
R Johnson 11 July 2003 12 months
M W Oliver 14 February 2005 12 months
In the event of an early termination the Directors' contracts provide for compensation comprising basic
salary and a value of benefits as quoted in the last audited accounts. In the case of Mr Taylor and Mr
Elliott they also provide for a payment into the pension scheme equivalent to that which would have
been earned in the notice period.
Non-executive Directors
There are currently 3 Non-executive Directors.
Mr P Wardle was appointed Non-executive Chairman on 6 April 2000 and is entitled to 12 months
notice of termination.
Mr C J Fleetwood was appointed on 1 January 2005 and is Senior Independent Non-executive Director.
He is entitled to 3 months notice of termination.
Mr J F Dawson was appointed Non-executive Director on 19 January 1995 and is entitled to 3 months
notice of termination.
