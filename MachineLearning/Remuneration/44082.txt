 GROUP POLICY ON THE REMUNERATION OF
DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which introduced
new statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors'
remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after
31 December 2002. The report also meets the relevant
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority and describes how the Board has applied the
Principles of Good Governance relating to directors'
remuneration. As required by the regulations, a resolution
to approve this report will be proposed at the Annual
General Meeting of the Company at which the financial
statements will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the
Company's members on the 'auditable part' of the Directors'
Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion
that part of the report has been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by
the Regulations). The report has therefore been divided into
separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is comprised entirely of the
independent non-executive directors and meets as required
but at least once a year. The members of the Committee 
are Julian Seymour (Chairman), Sir Ronald Grierson and
Lord Hannay.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest
(other than as a shareholder), conflicts of interest arising
from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in 
the running of the business. The Committee makes
recommendations to the Board for final approval. 
No director plays a part in any discussion about his or her
own remuneration.
In determining the directors' remuneration for the year, 
the Committee consulted Lord Bell (Chairman) about its
proposals. The remuneration of the non-executive directors
is recommended by the Chairman and Finance Director 
and takes account of the time spent on Board and
Committee matters.
The Committee has access to professional advice from inside
and outside the company.
Remuneration policy
The Group is committed to attracting and retaining high
quality staff. Remuneration is set at levels commensurate
with competing firms in the same industry and is monitored
on a regular basis. The performance measurement of the
executive directors and key senior management and the
determination of the annual remuneration package are
undertaken by the Committee.
Executive directors are entitled to accept external
appointments outside the Company providing that the
Chairman's permission is sought.
Remuneration packages
There are five main elements of the remuneration package
for executive directors and senior management:
  Basic annual salary and benefits
  Annual bonus payments which cannot exceed 
25% of salary
  Share option incentives;
  Long-term incentive plans; and
  Pension arrangements.
The benefits provided by the Group to the executive directors
consists principally of a car and private medical insurance.
A bonus of 15% of the relevant executive directors salary
may be paid to each director if profit targets set by the
Board are met. A bonus of 25% may be paid to each
executive director if profit targets set by the Board are
exceeded by at least 20%.
The Company operates an Executive Share Option Scheme
for executive Board directors, subsidiary Board directors 
and senior employees. All executive options granted from
November 1997 (other than special executive options) are
subject to the Group achieving during the period of grant
an average total shareholder return on the shares for the
preceding three years which exceeds the average FTSE 100
total shareholder return for the same period and a percentage
growth in earnings per share which is at least equal to 
the percentage growth in the Retail Price Index plus 6%
over three years. Executive share options granted before
November 1997 have no performance criteria. The exercise
price of the options granted under the above scheme is
equal to the market value of the Company's shares at the
time when the options are granted.
18 Annual Report & Accounts 2002
Report of the Board to the Shareholders on Directors' Remuneration Lord Bell has special executive options over 1,000,000 ordinary
shares which were issued in November 1997. These special
options will not ordinarily be exercisable less than five years
from the date of grant and are subject to a performance
target of growth in diluted earnings per ordinary share being
achieved such as would place the Group in the upper quartile
of the FTSE 100 companies compiled by reference to growth
in diluted earnings per share over the same period.
Mark Smith and Alan Chamberlain have special executive
options over 160,000 and 25,000 ordinary shares respectively
which were issued in May 2001. These special options will
not ordinarily be exercisable less than three years from the
date of grant and are subject to a performance target growth
in earnings per share which is at least equal to the percentage
growth in the Retail Price Index plus 9% and an average total
shareholder return on the shares which exceeds the average
FTSE 100 total shareholder return for the same period.
The Company received shareholders' approval to introduce
a long term incentive plan in December 2000 to incentivise
the executive Directors and the divisional heads. The 
scheme is designed to align long term motivations of senior
management with the interests of shareholders and to link
their remuneration to the performance of the Group. For
the initial award in 2001 the targets are as follows: The
Group and relevant business units' pre tax profits must have
increased by at least 10% per annum and the growth in 
the Company's headline earnings per share over the
performance period must exceed the percentage growth in
Retail Price Index over that period by at least 6%. If the first
two targets are met, then the number of shares that will be
released will be dependent on how the Company's total
shareholder return over the performance period compares
with that of the companies which comprise the FTSE 100
index over the same period.
The Company also received shareholder approval in
December 2000 to introduce The Co-Investment Plan. 
This is intended to incentivise senior management and to
encourage share ownership. Participants will be invited to
apply up to 50% of their cash bonus (after tax) in the purchase
of shares to be held in the Employee Trust for three years. In
return, the participant receives an award over an equivalent
number of shares which will be held in the Employee Trust
and released at the end of the three year period.
The Company's policy is to grant options to directors at the
discretion of the Committee taking into account individual
performance. It is the Company's policy to phase the granting
of share options rather than to award them in a single large
block to any individual.
The Company also operates a Savings-Related Share Option
Scheme which is open to all employees after an initial
qualifying period.
Pension contributions on behalf of the executive directors
are paid by the Company to the Group's money purchase
pension scheme or to a personal pension scheme up to the
value of 20% of their basic salary.
Directors contracts
All executive directors and employees have rolling contracts
of employment with a notice period that does not exceed
twelve months. Any compensation payable on early
termination of employment contracts is considered on a
case by case basis.
Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company's performance,
measured by total shareholder return, compared with the

total shareholder return.

During 2001 some of the executive directors chose to sacrifice part of their annual salary increase as part of a new bonus
scheme which allowed them to earn double the sacrifice as a bonus if the profit targets set by the Board were met. In 2001
these targets were not met. In 2002 the executive directors salaries were reinstated to the full amount.
Alan Chamberlain is paid a fee of  17,500 in respect of his work as a non-executive director. The balance of his remuneration
relates to work carried out by him for the Group on acquisitions and disposals.
Stephen Sherbourne is paid a fee of  16,000 in respect of his work as a non-executive director with the balance of his
remuneration relating to work carried out by him for the Group on client activities.
The sums paid to Julian Seymour are in respect of consultancy fees.
The pension contributions made by the Company are in respect of money purchase schemes. Contributions in respect of Lord
Bell, Piers Pottinger, Mark Smith, Rupert Howell and Robin Price for the year ended 31 December 2001 were  123,000,
 80,200,  42,000,  70,000 and  42,000 respectively. Piers Pottinger, Mark Smith, and Stephen Sherbourne are members of
