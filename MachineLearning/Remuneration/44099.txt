 Lord Bell has special executive options over 1,000,000
ordinary shares. These special options will not ordinarily be
exercisable less than five years from the date of grant and are
subject to a performance target of growth in diluted earnings
per ordinary share being achieved such as would place the
Group in the upper quartile of the FTSE 100 companies
compiled by reference to growth in diluted earnings per share
over the same period.
Mark Smith and Alan Chamberlain have special executive
options over 160,000 and 25,000 ordinary shares respectively.
These special options will not ordinarily be exercisable less
than three years from the date of grant and are subject to a
performance target growth in earnings per share which is at
least equal to the percentage growth in the Retail Price Index
plus 9% and an average total shareholder return on the shares
which exceeds the average FTSE 100 total shareholder return
for the same period.
The Company received shareholders' approval to introduce a
long term incentive plan in December 2000 to incentivise the
executive Directors and the divisional heads. The scheme is
designed to align long term motivations of senior management
with the interests of shareholders and to link their remuneration
to the performance of the Group. For the initial award in 2001
the targets are as follows: The Group and relevant business
units' pre tax profits must have increased by at least 10% per
annum and, the growth in the Company's headline earnings
per share over the performance period must exceed the
percentage growth in Retail Price Index over that period by at
least 6%. If the first two targets are met, then the number of
shares that will be released will be dependent on how the
Company's total shareholder return over the performance
period compares with that of the companies which comprise
the FTSE 100 index over the same period.
The Company also received shareholder approval in December
2000 to introduce The Co-Investment Plan. This is intended 
to incentivise senior management and to encourage share
ownership. Participants will be invited to apply up to 50% of
their cash bonus (after tax) in the purchase of shares to be held
in the Employee Trust for three years. In return, the participant
receives an award over an equivalent number of shares which
will be held in the Employee Trust and released at the end of
the three year period.
The Company's policy is to grant options to directors at the
discretion of the Committee taking into account individual
performance. It is the company's policy to phase the granting
of share options rather than to award them in a single large
block to any individual.
The Company also operates a Savings-Related Share Option
Scheme which is open to all employees after an initial
qualifying period.
Pension contributions on behalf of the executive directors are
paid by the Company to the Group's money purchase pension
scheme or to a personal pension scheme up to the value of
20% of their basic salary.
Directors' contracts
All executive directors and employees have rolling contracts of
employment with a notice period that does not exceed twelve
months. Any compensation payable on early termination of
employment contracts is considered on a case by case basis.
Performance graph
The following graph shows the company's performance,
measured by total shareholder return, compared with the

total shareholder return.

Review of the business
Chime Communications PLC is the parent company of a group
of companies principally engaged in providing public relations,
advertising, market research, direct marketing, design and
event management consultancy and it is the intention of the
directors that it should continue to be so. A review of the
business is given in the Chairman's Statement.
Results and dividends
The Group's profit and loss account is set out on page 32 and
shows a loss before taxation for the year to 31 December
2003 of   11,159,000 (2002: Loss  36,352,000) after 
charging goodwill amortisation and impairment, exceptional
items and the loss on disposal of a discontinued operation of
 16,733,000 (2002:  43,381,000). The directors do not
recommend the payment of a final dividend (2002:  nil)
bringing the total dividend for the year to  nil (2002:
 1,883,000 (1.27p per ordinary share)).
On 24 October 2003, at an extraordinary general meeting, the
company reorganised and reduced its share capital and
cancelled its share premium account. The ordinary shares of
25p each were subdivided into one ordinary share of 5p and
one deferred share of 20p. With the sanction of the High
Courts of Justice the deferred shares were cancelled and
extinguished. The company's Articles of Association were
amended accordingly.
On 30 September 2003, the Company issued warrants to the
Royal Bank of Scotland (the Bank ) over 7,949,108 ordinary
shares at a strike price of 25p. The warrants were issued
following an agreement made between the Company and the
Royal Bank of Scotland on 14 March 2003 pursuant to which
the Company agreed to issue to a subsidiary of the Bank
warrants to subscribe for up to 5% of the fully diluted share
capital of the Company. The warrants are exercisable at any
time prior to the third anniversary of the date of issue.

PLC are disclosed as part of the Report of the Board to the
