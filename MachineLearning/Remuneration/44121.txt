Annual Report 2007
Directors' remuneration report
Group policy on the remuneration of
directors and employees
This report has been prepared in accordance
with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 
1985. The report also meets the relevant
requirements of the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority and describes
how the board has applied the Principles 
of Good Governance relating to directors'
remuneration. As required by the Act, a
resolution to approve this report will be
proposed at the Annual General Meeting 
of the Company at which the financial
statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the
Company's members on the  auditable part' 
of the Directors' Remuneration Report and 
to state whether in their opinion that part of
the report has been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
The report has therefore been divided into
separate sections for audited and unaudited
information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The composition, chairmanship and activities
of the Remuneration Committee are set out 
on pages 16 and 21. The members of the
Committee receive remuneration as set out in
this report. They abstain from participating
where their own interests are concerned and
have no involvement in the day-to-day
management of the Group's operations.
The Chairman and Finance Director are invited
to attend meetings when required but this
would not include when matters relating to
their own remuneration arrangements are
discussed. The Committee also uses external
independent financial consultants to provide
advice primarily on competitive market levels
and on the performance-related elements of
the Executive Directors' remuneration.
The Committee's terms of reference are
available on request from the Company
Secretary and will be available for inspection 
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Remuneration Policy
The Group is committed to attracting and
retaining high quality staff. Remuneration is set
at levels commensurate with competing firms
in the same industry and is monitored on a
regular basis. The performance measurement
of the Executive Directors and key senior
management and the determination of their
annual remuneration packages are undertaken
by the Committee. More generally, the
Committee reviews executive remuneration
arrangements regularly to ensure that they
remain effective, competitive and appropriate
to the Group's circumstances and prospects,
and monitors incentive award levels and
consequent company liabilities. It also 
reviews the awards of shares made under 
the various all-employee Bonus, Deferred 
and Executive Share Plans in terms of their
effect on dilution limits.
Three of the four Executive Directors spend a
large proportion of their time on fee earning
client work. Their remuneration packages are
therefore based on the appropriate market
rate for two different functions. One is the
management of the Group in the executive
roles of Chairman, Deputy Chairman and Chief
Executive and the other is as client handlers
and new business winners. Looked at in those
terms their remuneration is considered to be 
in line with market rates. The Committee
places considerable emphasis on the
performance linked elements of their
renumeration i.e. Annual Bonus, Deferred
Share Incentives and long-term incentives.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept
external appointments outside the Company
providing that the Chairman's permission is
sought and confirmed by the Board.
The fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors
represent compensation in connection with
Board and Committee meetings, and where
appropriate for devoting additional time and
expertise for the benefit of the Group in a
wider capacity. Non-Executive Directors do not
participate in the Company's pension or share
option or other incentive plans. The Board
considers that the Non-Executive Directors'
remuneration conforms with the requirements
of the Combined Code.
This Report sets out the Group's
Remuneration policies for the Directors for the
year ended 31 December 2007. These
policies are likely to continue to apply in future
years, unless there are specific reason for
change.
Remuneration packages
In 2007 there were five main elements of the
remuneration packages for Executive Directors
and senior management:
  basic annual salary and benefits;
  annual bonus payments which cannot
exceed 30% of salary;
  deferred share incentives; 
  long-term incentive plans; and
  pension arrangements.
Basic Annual Salary and Benefits
In setting salary levels, the Remuneration
Committee considers the experience and
responsibility of the Executive Directors and
their personal performance during the previous
year. The Committee also takes account of
salary levels within other companies of a
similar size, as well as the rates of increases
for other employees within the Group. The
Remuneration Committee reviews salaries with
effect from January each year. 
The benefits provided by the group to the
Executive Directors consist principally of a car
or car allowance and private medical insurance.
Annual Bonus
The Executive Directors' annual bonus
arrangements are focused on the achievement
of the Group's short-term financial objectives.
For 2007 a bonus of up to 22.5% for the
relevant Director's salary was paid as the
company met the profit targets set by the
Board. A further maximum of 7.5% could have
been paid had profit targets been exceeded
by up to 30%. The resultant bonuses for 2007
are shown in the remuneration table on page 27. Directors' remuneration report 25
From 2008 it is proposed to amend the
arrangements as follows; a bonus of up to
25% of the relevant Executive Director's salary
may be paid to each Director if profit targets
set by the Board are met. A further maximum
of 25% may be paid to each Executive
Director at the Remuneration Committee's
discretion, based on key performance
indicators linked to the Group's stated
strategy. Some of these will be non-financial.
The performance metrics used are chosen 
as the Committee believes that they are 
most aligned with shareholder value creation.
Bonus payments are not pensionable.
Deferred Share Plan
During 2006 the Company introduced a
Deferred Share Plan (the Plan). Under the 
Plan restricted rights over existing Chime
Communications shares are granted to
Executive Board Directors, subsidiary Board
Directors and senior employees of the Group.
A participant of the Plan must remain
employed by the Group for a period of three
years after the date of grant for the shares to
vest with the employee. There are no other
performance criteria attached to the restricted
shares. All grants under the Plan are approved
by the Remuneration Committee. The Deferred 
Share Plan replaced the Executive Share
Option Scheme.
The Executive Directors received grants under
the Plan in 2006, but will receive no further
awards under this Plan for the duration of 
the Co-Investment Plan. Details of their
participation are shown in the table on 
page 28.
Co-Investment Plan
In 2006 shareholder approval was granted to
introduce a Co-Investment Plan (CIP). The CIP
was established to align the interests of the
Company's most senior executives to the
three year business plan put in place during
2006. Participation in the plan is dependent
upon the commitment by the executive to
maintain an investment in the Company's
shares until the end of the performance
period, over shares with an initial value equal
to 50% of salary capped at a total of
 175,000 per participant. In return for this
commitment the executive is granted an 
award over a maximum of five times as many
matching shares. The number of matching
shares that vest, if any, are dependent upon
the achievement of performance targets
measured over a four year performance
period. 
50% of the matching shares are tied to the
aggregate reported earning per share and
50% are tied to total shareholder return (TSR)
relative to a peer group of other media
companies. 
The maximum award is for achieving EPS
growth equivalent to 26% per annum
compounded and a TSR ranking in the top
15% of the comparator group. In addition to
the above requirements the Remuneration
Committee must be satisfied as to the
underlying financial performance of the
company. The Executive Directors will receive
no further awards under any of the Company's
long-term incentive schemes for the duration
of this scheme.
Relative TSR is recognised as one of the best
indicators of whether a shareholder has
achieved a good return on investing in the
Group relative to its peer group. In addition, 
an EPS performance condition provides an
appropriate measure of the Group's underlying
financial performance.
The table on page 29 shows the maximum
number of shares that will vest with the
Executive Directors should the performance
targets be met in full.
Under the rules of the CIP, the Remuneration
Committee has the authority to make
adjustments to the published EPS if events
happen that make it fair and reasonable 
to do so.
In 2007 an adjustment has been made relating
to the amortisation of a long term client
contract of Fast Track, a business acquired 
in 2007. In the view of the Remuneration
Committee this is an accounting treatment
which was not anticipated when the plan was
established and is not a current trading item.
This adjustment represents only 2% of EPS. 
Share Option Schemes
Previously the Company has operated an
Executive Share Option Scheme for Executive
Directors, subsidiary Board directors and
senior employees. All executive options
granted from November 1997 (other than
special executive options) are subject to the
Group achieving during the period of grant, an
average total shareholder return on the shares
for the preceding three years which exceeds
the average FTSE 100 total shareholder return
for the same period and a percentage growth
in earnings per share which is at least equal to
the percentage growth in the Retail Price
Index plus 6% over three years. Executive
share options granted before November 1997
have no performance criteria. The exercise
price of the options granted under the above
scheme is equal to the market value of the
company's shares at the time when the
options were granted.
Executive share options are only expected to
be granted in future if there is a contractual
commitment or in exceptional circumstances.
The Company also operates a Savings-
Related Share Option Scheme which is open
to all employees after an initial qualifying period
of employment.
Pensions
Pension contributions on behalf of the
Executive Directors are paid by the Company
to the Group's money purchase pension
scheme or to a personal pension scheme up
to the value of 20% of their basic salary.
Directors' Contracts
The Company's policy is that Executive
Directors should normally be employed on
rolling contracts which may be terminated 
by the Company giving no more than 
12 months notice and which otherwise 
expires on retirement, currently at age 65. 
All Executive Directors and employees have
rolling contracts of employment with a notice
period that does not exceed twelve months.
Any compensation payable on early
termination of employment contracts is
considered on a case by case basis. 26 Chime Communications plc
