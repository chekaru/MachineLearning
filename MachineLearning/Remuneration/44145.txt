Directors' remuneration report
Group policy on the remuneration of
directors and employees
This report has been prepared in accordance
with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act
1985. The report also meets the relevant
requirements of the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority and describes
how the Board has applied the Principles of
Good Governance relating to directors'
remuneration. As required by the Act, a
resolution to approve this report will be
proposed at the Annual General Meeting
of the Company at which the financial
statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the
Company's members on the  auditable part'
of the Directors' remuneration report and
to state whether in their opinion that part of
the report has been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
The report has therefore been divided into
separate sections for audited and unaudited
information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The composition, chairmanship and activities
of the Remuneration Committee are set out on
pages 32 and 37. The members of the
Committee receive remuneration as set out in
this report. They abstain from participating
where their own interests are concerned and
have no involvement in the day-to-day
management of the Group's operations. Other
Directors attend meeting by invitation only but
this would not include when matters relating to
their own remuneration arrangements are
discussed. In addition to the current members
of the Committee Julian Seymour (resigned
31 December 2007) was a member when the
Co-Investment Plan, as detailed later, was
approved by the Committee.
During the financial period under review, the
Remuneration Committee sought the
assistance of the Chairman and Finance
Director relating to Directors' performance
and remuneration. The Committee used
Towers Perrin to provide advice primarily
on competitive market levels and on the
performance-related elements of the Executive
Directors' remuneration. Towers Perrin were
not contracted to supply any other services
during 2008. The Remuneration Committee
also approved the grant of share options
under the Savings-Related Share Option
Scheme, the grant of shares under the
Deferred Share Plan and they approved an
expenses policy for Executive Directors.
The Committee's terms of reference are
available on request from the Company
Secretary and will be available for inspection
at the forthcoming AGM.
Remuneration policy
The Group is committed to attracting and
retaining high-quality staff. Remuneration is set
at levels commensurate with competing firms
in the same industry and is monitored on a
regular basis. The performance measurement
of the Executive Directors and key senior
management and the determination of their
annual remuneration packages are undertaken
by the Committee. More generally, the
Committee reviews executive remuneration
arrangements regularly to ensure that they
remain effective, competitive and appropriate
to the Group's circumstances and prospects,
and monitors incentive award levels and
consequent company liabilities. It also
reviews the awards of shares made under
the Deferred Share Plan and of options over
shares under the Executive and Savings-
Related Share Options schemes in terms of
their effect on dilution limits.
Three of the four Executive Directors spend a
large proportion of their time on fee-earning
client work. Their remuneration packages are
therefore based on the appropriate market
rate for two different functions: one is the
management of the Group in the executive
roles of Chairman, Deputy Chairman and Chief
Executive and the other is as client handlers
and new business winners. Looked at in those
terms, their remuneration is considered to be
in line with market rates. The Committee
places considerable emphasis on the
performance-linked elements of their
remuneration, i.e. Annual Bonus, Deferred
Share Incentives and Long-Term Incentives.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept
external appointments outside the Company
providing that the Chairman's permission is
sought and confirmed by the Board.
The fees payable to the Non-Executive
Directors represent compensation in
connection with Board and Committee
meetings and, where appropriate, for devoting
additional time and expertise for the benefit of
the Group in a wider capacity. Non-Executive
Directors do not participate in the Company's
pension or share option or other incentive
plans. The Board considers that the Non-
Executive Directors' remuneration conforms
with the requirements of the Combined Code.
This Report sets out the Group's
Remuneration policies for the Directors for
the year ended 31 December 2008. These
policies are likely to continue to apply in
future years, unless there are specific reasons
for change.
Remuneration packages
In 2008 there were five main elements of
the remuneration packages for Executive
Directors:
  basic annual salary and benefits;
  annual bonus payments which cannot
exceed 50% of salary;
  deferred share incentives;
  long-term incentive plans; and
  pension arrangements.
Basic annual salary and benefits
In setting salary levels, the Remuneration
Committee considers the experience and
responsibility of the Executive Directors and
their personal performance during the previous
year. The Committee also takes account of
salary levels within other companies of a
similar size and nature, as well as the rates of
increases for other employees within the
Group. The Remuneration Committee reviews
salaries with effect from January each year.
The benefits provided by the Group to the
Executive Directors consist principally of
pension contributions, a car or car allowance
and private medical insurance.
With the exception of the Chief Executive,
no increases in salary were awarded to the
Executive Directors in either 2007 or 2008
consistent with greater emphasis on
incentivising performance through bonuses.
Annual bonus
The Executive Directors' annual bonus
arrangements are focused on the achievement
of the Group's short-term financial objectives.
The annual bonus allocation is capped at a
maximum of 50% of salary for the Executive
Directors, of this up to 25% of the relevant
Director's salary may be payable if the
Company meets the profit targets set by the
Board. A further maximum of 25% may be
paid to each Executive Director, based on key
performance indicators linked to the Group's
stated strategy and tailored to their individual
roles. Some of these are non-financial. The
Remuneration Committee reviews the specific
key performance indicators for each director
and their overall performance both against
those indicators and generally. Based on its
assessment, the Committee determines what,
if any, further bonus is payable. The
Committee believes the performance metrics
chosen align with shareholder value creation.
Bonus payments are not pensionable. Directors' remuneration report
Annual Report & Accounts 2008 41
For 2008, the key performance indicators
included:
  Growth in operating profit margin
  Growth in income from international work
  Growth in number and value of shared
clients
  Growth in average fee per client
  Revenue generation
  Client retention
  Cash management and conversion
  Quality of internal control
  Management of Chime's reputation
The Committee considered the performance
of the Directors in February 2009. The profit
targets set by the Board have been met in a
more challenging market than was anticipated
when they were set and performance
compares favourably with that of competitors.
The Committee has also assessed that each
of the Directors has achieved or exceeded
their individual key performance indicators
and, as a result, believes that such
exceptional performance fully justifies the
maximum bonus award.
The resultant bonuses for 2008 are shown in
the remuneration table on page 45.
Deferred Share Plan
During 2006 the Company introduced a
Deferred Share Plan (the Plan). Under the Plan
restricted rights over existing Chime
Communications shares are granted to
Executive Board Directors, subsidiary Board
Directors and senior employees of the Group.
A participant of the Plan must remain
employed by the Group for a period of three
years after the date of grant for the shares to
vest with the employee. There are no other
performance criteria attached to the restricted
shares. The plan aims to encourage the
retention of key employees. All grants under
the Plan are approved by the Remuneration
Committee. The grants under the scheme to
date have been relatively modest. The
Deferred Share Plan replaced the Executive
Share Option Scheme.
The Executive Directors received grants under
the Plan in 2006, but will receive no further
awards under this Plan for the duration of
the Co-Investment Plan. Details of their
participation are shown in the table on page 44.
Co-Investment Plan
In 2006 shareholder approval was granted to
introduce a Co-Investment Plan (CIP). The CIP
was established to align the interests of the
Company's most senior executives to the
three-year business plan put in place during
2006. Participation in the plan is dependent
upon the commitment by the executive to
maintain an investment in the Company's
shares until the end of the performance
period, over shares with an initial value up to
50% of salary capped at a total of  175,000
per participant. In return for this commitment
the executive is granted an award over a
maximum of five times as many matching
shares. The number of matching shares that
vest, if any, are dependent upon the
achievement of performance targets measured
over a four-year performance period.
50% of the matching shares are tied to the
aggregate reported earnings per share (EPS)
and 50% are tied to total shareholder return
(TSR) relative to a peer group of other media
companies. The comparator group for awards
in 2006 and 2007 was ITE Group, Wilmington
Group, M&C Saatchi, Tarsus Group, Next
Fifteen Communications, Cello Group,
Huntsworth, Centaur Media, Future, Chrysalis
Group, Bloomsbury Publishing, Creston,
Media Square and Scottish Media Group.
The maximum award is for achieving EPS
growth equivalent to 26% per annum
compounded and a TSR ranking in the top
15% of the comparator group. In addition to
the above requirements the Remuneration
Committee must be satisfied as to the
underlying financial performance of the
Company. The Executive Directors will receive
no further awards under any of the Company's
long-term incentive schemes for the duration
of this scheme.
Relative TSR is recognised as one of the best
indicators of whether a shareholder has
achieved a good return on investing in the
Group relative to its peer group. In addition, an
EPS performance condition provides an
appropriate measure of the Group's underlying
financial performance.
The table on page 45 shows the maximum
number of shares that will vest with the
Executive Directors should the performance
targets be met in full.
Under the rules of the CIP , the Remuneration
Committee has the authority to make
adjustments to the published EPS if events
happen that make it fair and reasonable to
do so.
In 2007 it was agreed that an adjustment
would be made going forward to the
published EPS relating to the amortisation
of a long-term client contract of Fast Track,
a business acquired in that year. In the view
of the Remuneration Committee this is
an accounting treatment which was not
anticipated when the plan was established
and is not a current trading item. This
adjustment represents only 2% of EPS.
Share Option schemes
Previously the Company has operated an
Executive Share Option Scheme for Executive
Directors, subsidiary Board directors and
senior employees. All executive options
granted from November 1997 (other than
special executive options) are subject to the
Group achieving during the period of grant, an
average total shareholder return on the shares
for the preceding three years which exceeds
the average FTSE 100 TSR for the same
period and a percentage growth in EPS which
is at least equal to the percentage growth in
the Retail Price Index plus 6% over three
years.The exercise price of the options
granted under the above scheme is equal to
the market value of the company's shares at
the time when the options were granted.
Executive share options are only expected to
be granted in future if there is a contractual
commitment or in exceptional circumstances.
The Company also operates a Savings-
Related Share Option Scheme which is open
to all employees after an initial qualifying
period of employment.
Pensions
Pension contributions on behalf of the
Executive Directors are paid by the Company
to the Group's money purchase pension
scheme or to a personal pension scheme up
to the value of 20% of their basic salary.
Directors' contracts
The Company's policy is that Executive
Directors should normally be employed on
rolling contracts which may be terminated by
the Company giving no more than 12 months
notice and which otherwise expire on
retirement, currently at age 65. In December
2006 the Company agreed a new service
contract with Lord Bell in order that he
may continue as a director beyond age 65.
All Executive Directors and employees have
rolling contracts of employment with a notice
period that does not exceed 12 months.
Any compensation payable on early
termination of employment contracts would
be in line with contractual and statutory
requirements. Chime Communications plc 42
