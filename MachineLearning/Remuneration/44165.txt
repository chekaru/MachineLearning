Group policy on the remuneration of Directors
and employees
This Report sets out the Group's Remuneration
policies for the Directors for the year ended
31 December 2009. Except where noted, these
policies are likely to continue to apply in future years,
unless there are specific reasons for change. It has
been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the
Accounting regulations under the Companies Act
2006. The report also meets the relevant requirements
of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority
and describes how the Board has applied the
principles relating to Directors' remuneration in the
Combined Code. As required by the Act, a resolution
to approve this report will be proposed at the Annual
General Meeting of the Company at which the
financial statements will be approved. 
The Act requires the auditors to report to the
Company's members on certain parts of the Directors'
remuneration report and to state whether in their
opinion those parts of the report have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Accounting
Regulations. The report has therefore been divided
into separate sections for audited and unaudited
information.
Unaudited Information
Remuneration Committee
The composition, chairmanship and activities of the
Remuneration Committee are set out on pages 10 
and 18. The members of the Committee receive
remuneration as set out in this report. They abstain
from participating where their own interests are
concerned and have no involvement in the day-to-day
management of the Group's operations. Other
Directors attend meetings by invitation only but this
would not include when matters relating to their own
remuneration arrangements are discussed. In addition
to the current members of the Committee, Julian
Seymour (resigned 31 December 2007) was a
member when the 2006 Co-Investment Plan, as
detailed later, was approved by the Committee. A
summary of the role, key responsibilities and the work
carried out by the Committee are outlined within the
Corporate Governance Report on pages 18 to 19.
During the financial period under review, the
Remuneration Committee sought the assistance of
the Chairman and Finance Director relating to
Directors' performance and remuneration. The
Committee used Towers Perrin (now Towers Watson)
to provide advice primarily on competitive market
levels, on the performance-related elements of the
Executive Directors' remuneration and formulation of
new long-term incentive scheme. Towers Watson
were not contracted to supply any other services
during 2009. The Remuneration Committee also
approved the grant of share options under the
Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, the grant of
shares under the VCCP Key Players Incentive Scheme
and the grant of shares under the Deferred Share Plan. 
The Committee's terms of reference are available on
request from the Company Secretary and will be
available for inspection at the forthcoming Annual
General Meeting. 
Remuneration Policy
The Group is committed to attracting and retaining
high quality staff. Remuneration is set at levels
commensurate with competing firms in the same
industry and is monitored on a regular basis. The
performance measurement of the Executive Directors
and key senior management and the determination of
their annual remuneration packages are undertaken
by the Committee. More generally, the Committee
reviews executive remuneration arrangements
regularly to ensure that they remain effective,
competitive and appropriate to the Group's
circumstances and prospects, and monitors incentive
award levels and consequent company liabilities. It
also reviews the awards of shares made under the
various Savings Related, Deferred, VCCP Key Players
Incentive Schemes and Co-Investment Plan in terms
of their effect on dilution limits.
Three of the four Executive Directors spend a large
proportion of their time on fee earning client work.
Their remuneration packages are therefore based on
the appropriate market rate for two different functions.
One is the management of the Group in the executive
roles of Chairman, Deputy Chairman and Chief
Executive and the other is as client handlers and new
business winners. Looked at in those terms their
remuneration is considered to be in line with market
rates. The Committee places considerable emphasis
on the performance linked elements of their
remuneration i.e. Annual Bonus, Deferred Share
Incentives and Long-Term Incentives.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept external
appointments outside the Company and retain any
fees paid to them providing that the Chairman's
permission is sought and confirmed by the Board. 
The fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors
represent compensation in connection with Board and
Committee meetings, and where appropriate for
devoting additional time and expertise for the benefit
of the Group in a wider capacity. Non-Executive
Directors do not participate in the Company's pension
or share option or other incentive plans. The Board
considers that the Non-Executive Directors'
remuneration conforms with the requirements of the
Combined Code. 
Director's Remuneration Report Annual Report and Accounts 2009 25
Remuneration packages of the executive directors
In 2009 there were five main elements of the
remuneration packages for Executive Directors:
  basic annual salary and benefits;
  annual bonus payments which cannot exceed 
50% of salary;
  deferred share incentives;
  long-term incentive plans; and
  pension arrangements.
Basic Annual Salary and Benefits
In setting salary levels, the Remuneration Committee
considers the experience and responsibility of the
Executive Directors and their personal performance
during the previous year. The Committee also takes
account of salary levels within other companies of 
a similar size and nature, as well as the rates of
increases for other employees within the Group. The
Remuneration Committee reviews salaries with effect
from January each year. The benefits provided by the
Group to the Executive Directors consist principally of
pension contribution, a car or car allowance and
private medical insurance.
With the exception of the Chief Executive (who
received an increase in 2009), no increases in salary
were awarded to the Executive Directors in either
2008 or 2009 consistent with greater emphasis on
incentivising performance through bonuses. 
Annual Bonus
The Executive Directors' annual bonus arrangements
are focused on the achievement of the Group's short-
term objectives. The annual bonus allocation is
capped at a maximum of 50% of salary for the
Executive Directors; of this up to 25% of the relevant
Director's salary may be payable if the Company
meets the profit targets set by the Board. A further
maximum of 25% may be paid to each Executive
Director, based on performance against key
performance indicators linked to the Group's stated
strategy and tailored to their individual roles. Some of
these are non-financial. The Remuneration Committee
reviews the specific key performance indicators for
each Director and assesses their overall performance
both against those indicators and generally. Based on
this assessment the Committee determines what, if
any, further bonus is payable. The Committee believes
the performance metrics chosen align with shareholder
value creation. Bonus payments are not pensionable.
For 2009, the key performance indicators included:
  Growth in operating profit margin
  Growth in income from international work
  Growth in number and value of shared clients
  Growth in average fee per client
  Revenue generation
  Client retention
  Cash management and conversion
  Quality of internal control
  Management of Chime's reputation
The Committee considered the performance of the
Directors in March 2010. The profit targets set by 
the Committee have been met in a challenging
environment and performance again compares
favourably with that of competitors. The Committee
has also assessed each Directors' achievements
against their individual key performance indicators.
Bonus awards averaging 40% of salary have been
approved by the Committee reflecting generally
excellent performance.
The resultant bonuses for 2009 are shown in the
remuneration table on page 29.
Deferred Share Plan
During 2006 the Company introduced a Deferred
Share Plan (the Plan). Under the Plan restricted rights
over existing Chime Communications shares are
granted to Executive Board Directors, subsidiary
Board Directors and senior employees of the Group. 
A participant of the Plan must remain employed by the
Group for a fixed period as determined by the
Remuneration Committee at the date of grant after the
date of grant for the shares to vest with the employee.
There are no other performance criteria attached to
the restricted shares. The plan aims to encourage the
retention of key employees. All grants under the Plan
are approved by the Remuneration Committee. The
grants under the Plan to date have been relatively
modest. The Deferred Share Plan replaced the
Executive Share Option Scheme. There are presently
deferred share plans that have vesting periods of two,
three and four years.
The Executive Directors received grants under the
Plan in 2006, but are excluded from participation in
any other incentive scheme for the duration of the
current Co-Investment Plan or any replacement long
term investment plan. Details of their participation are
shown in the table on page 30.
The rules of the Plan as approved by the shareholders
in general meeting in 2006 authorise the Remuneration
Committee to use its discretion to to get or keep
favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory
treatment of participants  and as such the Committee
has considered and authorised an earlier maturity date
of March 2010 (previously July 2010) as it will benefit
the members at no additional cost to the shareholders.
The grant comprises 34 members and totals 151,000
shares. The Executive Directors are not members of
the Plan under this grant as noted above. 26 Chime Communications plc
Co-Investment Plan
In 2006 shareholder approval was granted to
introduce a Co-Investment Plan (CIP). The CIP was
established to align the interests of the Company's
most senior executives to the three year business plan
put in place during 2006. Participation in the plan is
dependent upon the commitment by the executive to
maintain an investment in the Company's shares until
the end of the performance period, with an initial value
of up to 50% of salary, capped at a total value of
 175,000 per participant. In return for this commitment
the executive is granted an award over a maximum of
five times as many matching shares. The number of
matching shares that vest, if any, is dependent upon
the achievement of performance targets measured
over a four year performance period.
50% of the matching shares is tied to the aggregate
reported earnings per share (EPS) and 50% are tied to
total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a peer group
of other media companies. The comparator group for
awards in 2006 and 2007 was ITE group, Wilmington
Group, M&C Saatchi, Tarsus Group, Next Fifteen
Communications, Cello Group, Huntsworth, Centaur
Media, Future, Chrysalis Group, Bloomsbury
Publishing, Creston, Media Square and STV Group.
No further awards were made after 2007.
The maximum award is for achieving EPS growth
equivalent to 26% per annum compounded and a
TSR ranking in the top 15% of the comparator 
group. In addition to the above requirements the
Remuneration Committee must be satisfied as to the
underlying financial performance of the Company. 
Relative TSR is recognised as one of the best
indicators of whether a shareholder has achieved a
good return on investing in the Group relative to its
peer group. In addition, an EPS performance
condition provides an appropriate measure of the
Group's underlying financial performance.
Under the rules of the CIP the Executive Directors
received no awards (post 2006) under any of the
Company's long-term incentive schemes for the
duration of this scheme. 
The table on page 30 shows the maximum number of
shares that will vest with the Executive Directors
should the performance targets be met in full together
with the number of shares to be awarded at current
estimated performance. The CIP includes four other
senior executives in addition to the Executive Directors.
Under the rules of the CIP , the Remuneration
Committee has the authority to make adjustments to
the published EPS if events happen that make it fair
and reasonable to do so. 
In 2010 it was agreed that an adjustment would be
made to the published EPS for the year ended 31
December 2009. The adjustment is detailed in note 5
to the accounts. In the view of the Remuneration
Committee the adjustment represents amounts which
were either non-recurring, non-trading items or where
the accounting treatment was not anticipated when
the plan was established. This adjustment represents
only 2% of EPS.
Level of Award
The Committee has considered the potential level of
the award and has determined that the part that is
dependent on EPS performance between 2006 to
2009 will be 49.7%. The TSR performance period
ends on the date of the preliminary announcement of
results on 10th March 2010 and will therefore require
further calculation after that date. Estimates made in
early March forecast that the TSR target would be met
in full and therefore this would indicate the payment of
that element at 100%. If realised as estimated the total
number of shares that will vest will be 74.85% of the
maximum as shown on page 30.
Vesting Date
The rules of the CIP approved by shareholders in
2006 provide that the Committee may:
(i) change the CIP to take account of changes to
the ICTA 1988 or other relevant law and:
(ii) may change the Plan to get or keep favourable
tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment
for Participants or any member of the Group
The CIP provided the Company with an element of
executive retention in that the participants would forfeit 
their right to matching shares if they left the Company
after the performance period ended but prior to the
original Vesting Date of 10th September 2010. 
The Committee has considered and resolved that the
participants of the Plan will be given the option to elect
to have their matching shares (either in total or 
in part) vest at the earlier date of 19th March. Any
earlier vesting on this date would be subject to a
number of conditions. 
A participant vesting at the earlier date would agree 
to forfeit the vested matching shares should they leave
the company's employment in the period prior to 
the original Vesting Date of 11th September 2010. 
As each of the participants have contractual notice
periods in excess of six months the Committee has
assessed that this is unlikely but protection for the
shareholders is still appropriate. In addition the
Committee wished to ensure that should a participant
leave the Company as a bad leaver  (as defined in the
rules of the CIP) during the period to 10th September
2010 then any costs attributable to the earlier vesting
would also require repayment to the Company. Annual Report and Accounts 2009 27
Any participant of the Plan opting to vest early would
agree not to sell their matching shares prior to the
original Vesting Date.
The Committee believes that these changes, with the
executive retention and cost repayment measures in
place, are in the interests of shareholders. 
Replacement Plan
As the current CIP matures in March 2010 the
Committee has developed a replacement long term
investment plan in order to continue to incentivise the
Executive Directors and senior management.
Shareholder approval of the new plan will be sought at
the forthcoming AGM and further details will be
circulated to shareholders with the Notice of Meeting.
VCCP Key Players Incentive Scheme
During 2008 the Company introduced an Incentive
Scheme for key individuals within the VCCP Group.
Under the Scheme a bonus pool is calculated with
reference to growth in profits of the VCCP Group, the
bonus pool is payable 50% in cash and 50% in
restricted rights over existing Chime Communications
shares. The distribution of the pool is restricted to
senior employees of the VCCP Group. The Scheme
covers the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December
2012. A participant of the Scheme must remain
employed by the Group for a fixed period as
determined by the Remuneration Committee at the
date of grant after the date of grant for the cash and
shares to vest with the employee. The Scheme allows
for a claw-back facility if the profits of the VCCP Group
fall below a base level of profits. There are no other
performance criteria attached to the cash or restricted
shares. The Scheme aims to encourage the retention
of key employees within the VCCP Group. All grants
under the Scheme are approved by the Remuneration
Committee. The grants under the Scheme todate have
been relatively modest.
Share Option Schemes
Previously the Company has operated an Executive
Share Option Scheme for Executive Directors,
subsidiary Board Directors and senior employees. 
All executive options granted from November 1997
(other than special executive options) are subject to
the Group achieving during the period of grant, an
average total shareholder return on the shares for the
preceding three years which exceeds the average
FTSE 100 total shareholder return for the same
period and a percentage growth in earnings per share
which is at least equal to the percentage growth in
the Retail Price Index plus 6% over three years. The
exercise price of the options granted under the above
scheme is equal to the market value of the
Company's shares at the time when the options were
granted. There have been no grants of Executive
Share Options since 2005. Executive share options
are only expected to be granted in future if there 
is a contractual commitment or in exceptional
circumstances.
The Company also operates a Savings-Related Share
Option Scheme which is open to all employees after
an initial qualifying period of employment.
Pensions
Pension contributions on behalf of the Executive
Directors are paid by the Company to the Group's
money purchase pension scheme or to a personal
pension scheme up to the value of 20% of their 
basic salary.
Directors' interests in contracts and other
transactions with Group companies
No Director has a material interest in any contract
with any Group company other than a service
contract.
Directors' contracts
The Company's policy is that Executive Directors
should normally be employed on rolling contracts
which may be terminated by the Company giving no
more than 12 months' notice and which otherwise
expires on retirement, currently at age 65. In
December 2006 the Company agreed a new service
contract with Lord Bell in order that he may continue
as a Director beyond age 65. All Executive Directors
and employees have rolling contracts of employment
with a notice period that does not exceed 12 months.
Any compensation payable on early termination of
employment contracts would be in line with
contractual and statutory requirements.  28 Chime Communications plc

following appointment and, thereafter, re-election by rotation every three years. 
There are no provisions for compensation payments on early termination in the Non-Executive Directors' Terms
and Conditions of Appointment.

qualify for the plan. 
No other terms of the Deferred Share Plan were varied during the year, or previous years.

The earlier vesting date of 19th March 2010 was approved by the Remuneration Committee in March 2010 -
further details are shown on page 26.

shown above vesting to the Executive Directors. If this is the case the matching shares awarded would be as
follows: Lord Bell - 313,199 shares; Piers Pottinger - 344,703 shares; Christopher Satterthwaite - 336,376
shares and; Mark Smith - 244,310 shares.  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 31
