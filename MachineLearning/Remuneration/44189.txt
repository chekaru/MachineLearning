Group Policy on the Remuneration of Directors
and Employees
This Report sets out the Group's Remuneration
policies for the Directors for the year ended 
31 December 2010. Except where noted, these
policies are likely to continue to apply in future years,
unless there are specific reasons for change. It has
been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to 
the Accounting regulations under the Companies 
Act 2006. The Report also meets the relevant
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority and describes how the Board 
has applied the principles relating to Directors'
remuneration in the Combined Code. As required by
the Act, resolutions to approve this Report and the
company's financial statements will be proposed at
the Annual General Meeting.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the
Company's members on certain parts of the Directors'
Remuneration Report and to state whether in their
opinion those parts of the Report have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Accounting
Regulations. The Report has therefore been divided
into separate sections for audited and unaudited
information.
Unaudited Information
Remuneration Committee
The composition, chairmanship and activities of the
Remuneration Committee are set out on pages 14
and 24. The members of the Committee receive
remuneration as set out in this report. They abstain
from participating where their own interests are
concerned and have no involvement in the day-to-day
management of the Group's operations. Other
Directors attend meetings by invitation only but this
would not include when matters relating to their own
remuneration arrangements are discussed. In addition
to the current members of the Committee, Julian
Seymour (resigned 31 December 2007) was a
member when the 2006 Co-Investment Plan, as
detailed later, was approved by the Committee. A
summary of the role, key responsibilities and the work
carried out by the Committee are outlined within the
Corporate Governance Report on page 24. 
During the financial period under review, the
Remuneration Committee sought the assistance of
the Chairman and Finance Director relating to
Directors' performance and remuneration. The
Committee used Towers Watson to provide specialist
third party advice primarily on competitive market
levels, on the performance-related elements of the
Executive Directors' remuneration and formulation 
of a new long-term incentive scheme. Towers Watson
were not contracted to supply any other services
during 2010. The Remuneration Committee also
approved the grant of share options under the
Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, the grant 
of shares under the VCCP Key Players Incentive
Scheme, the grant of shares under the Deferred 
Share Plan and the grant of awards under the 2010
Co-Investment Plan.
The Committee's terms of reference are available on
request from the Company Secretary, via the Chime
website www.chime.plc.uk and, will be available for
inspection at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Remuneration Policy
The Group is committed to attracting and retaining
high quality staff. Remuneration is set at levels
commensurate with competing firms in the same
industry and is monitored on a regular basis. The
performance measurement of the Executive Directors
and key senior management and the determination of
their annual remuneration packages are undertaken
by the Committee. More generally, the Committee
reviews executive remuneration arrangements
regularly to ensure that they remain effective,
competitive and appropriate to the Group's
circumstances and prospects, and monitors incentive
award levels and consequent company liabilities. 
It also reviews the awards of shares made under the
various Savings Related, Deferred, VCCP Key Players
Incentive Scheme and Co-Investment Plan in terms of
their effect on dilution limits. 
Three of the four Executive Directors spend a large
proportion of their time on fee earning client work.
Their remuneration packages are therefore based on
the appropriate market rate for two different functions.
One is the management of the Group in the executive
roles of Chairman, Deputy Chairman and Chief
Executive and the other is as client handlers and new
business winners. Looked at in those terms their
remuneration is considered to be in line with market
rates. The Committee places considerable emphasis
on the performance linked elements of their
remuneration i.e. Annual Bonus, Deferred Share
Incentives and Long-Term Incentives.
Non-Executive Directors Remuneration
The fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors during
2010 are set out on page 35. These had remained
unchanged since 2008. In 2010 the level of fees
payable to Rodger Hughes, the Senior Independent
Director, was increased to reflect the increased
commitment required to fulfil his duties and his
appointment as a Non-Executive Director of a
subsidiary company.
The Non-Executive Directors do not participate in the
Company's pension or share option or other incentive
plans. The Board considers that the Non-Executive
Directors' remuneration conforms with the
requirements of the Code.
Directors' Remuneration Report Annual Report and Accounts 2010 31
Executive Director Remuneration
In 2010 there were five main elements of the
remuneration packages for Executive Directors:
  basic annual salary and benefits;
  annual bonus payments which cannot exceed 
50% of salary;
  deferred share incentives;
  long-term incentive plans; and
  pension arrangements.
Basic Annual Salary and Benefits
In setting salary levels, the Remuneration Committee
considers the experience and responsibility of the
Executive Directors and their personal performance
during the previous year. The Committee also takes
account of salary levels within other companies of a
similar size and nature, as well as the rates of
increases for other employees within the Group. The
Remuneration Committee reviews salaries with effect
from January each year. 
Since January 2001 there have been only two salary
increases to Executive Directors: firstly, to Mark Smith,
Group Finance Director, in 2006 and secondly to
Christopher Satterthwaite, Chief Executive, in 2009.
The Committee has only awarded salary increases 
for a Director assuming additional responsibilities
provided that amounts paid remain at market levels.
The benefits provided by the Group to the Executive
Directors consist principally of pension allowance, a
car or car allowance and private medical insurance.
Annual Bonus
The Executive Directors' annual bonus arrangements
are focused on the achievement of the Group's short-
term objectives. The annual bonus allocation is
capped at a maximum of 50% of salary for the
Executive Directors; of this up to 25% of the relevant
Director's salary may be payable if the Company
meets the profit targets set by the Board. A further
maximum of 25% may be paid to each Executive
Director, based on performance against personal key
performance indicators linked to the Group's stated
strategy and tailored to their individual roles. Some of
these are non-financial. The Remuneration Committee
reviews the specific key performance indicators for
each Director and assesses their overall performance
both against those indicators and generally. Based on
this assessment the Committee determines what, if
any, further bonus is payable. The Committee believes
the performance metrics chosen align with shareholder 
value creation. Bonus payments are not pensionable.
For 2010, the key performance indicators included:
  Growth in operating profit margin
  Growth in income from international work
  Growth in number and value of shared clients
  Growth in average fee per client
  Revenue generation
  Client retention
  Cash management and conversion
  Quality of internal control
  Management of Chime's reputation
  Retention of senior executives 
  Management of debtors
The Committee considered the performance of the
Directors in March 2011. The profit targets set by 
the Committee have been met in a challenging
environment and performance again compares
favourably with that of competitors. The Committee has
also assessed each Directors' achievements against
their individual key performance indicators. Bonus
awards averaging 44% of salary have been approved by
the Committee reflecting generally excellent performance.
The resultant bonuses for each Director for 2010 are
shown in the remuneration table on page 35.
Deferred Share Plan
During 2006 the Company introduced a Deferred
Share Plan (the Plan). Under the Plan restricted rights
over existing Chime Communications shares are
granted to Executive Board Directors, subsidiary
Board Directors and senior employees of the Group. 
A participant of the Plan must remain employed by 
the Group for a fixed period as determined by the
Remuneration Committee at the date of grant after the
date of grant for the shares to vest with the employee.
There are no other performance criteria attached to
the restricted shares. The Plan aims to encourage the
retention of key employees. All grants under the Plan
are approved by the Remuneration Committee. The
grants under the Plan to date have been relatively
modest. The Deferred Share Plan replaced the
Executive Share Option Scheme. There are presently
Deferred Share Plans that have vesting periods of one,
two, and three years.
The Executive Directors received grants under the
Plan in 2006 but were excluded from participation in
any other incentive scheme for the duration of the
2006 Co-Investment Plan.
The rules of the Plan as approved by shareholders in
2006 authorised the Remuneration Committee to use
its discretion to get or keep favourable tax, exchange
control or regulatory treatment  for participants. 
As such the Committee authorised the earlier maturity
date of March 2010 (previously July 2010) in order to
benefit the participants of the grant in 2007. This
change was at no additional cost to the shareholders.
The grant comprised 34 participants and 151,000
shares and did not include the Executive Directors.  32 Chime Communications plc

2006 Co-Investment Plan
In 2006 shareholder approval was granted to
introduce a Co-Investment Plan (CIP). The CIP was
established to align the interests of the Company's
most senior executives to the three year business plan
put in place during 2006. Participation in the Plan was
dependent upon the commitment by the executive to
maintain an investment in the Company's shares until
the end of the performance period in return for an
award over a maximum of five times as many
matching shares. The number of matching shares that
vest was dependent upon the achievement of
performance targets measured over a four year
performance period.
Assessment of Peformance
50% of the matching shares were tied to the aggregate 
reported earnings per share (EPS) and 50% tied to
total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a peer group
of other media companies. No further awards were
made after 2007.
The maximum award would have been for achieving
EPS growth the equivalent to 26% per annum
compounded and a TSR ranking in the top 15% of the
peer group. In addition to the above requirements, the
Remuneration Committee had to be satisfied as to the
underlying financial performance of the Company.
The Company's financial performance over the four
year performance period resulted in EPS growth of
15.91% translating to a payout against the EPS target
of 49.53%. Against the peer group of companies, the
Company's annualised TSR placed it above the first
ranking peer company, giving a 100% payout against
the TSR target. In total 74.77% of the maximum
possible award shares vested. This totalled 1,816,650
shares. The shares had been purchased previously,
and held by the Chime Communications plc Employee
Trust during the life of the CIP for this purpose and, in
accordance with the approval by shareholders of the
CIP in 2006. 
The table on page 36 shows the shares that vested to
the Executive Directors.
Vesting Date
The rules of the CIP approved by shareholders in
2006 provide that the Committee may:
(i) change the CIP to take account of changes to
the ICTA 1988 or other relevant law and:
(ii) may change the CIP to get or keep favourable
tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment
for participants or any member of the Group
The CIP provided the Company with an element of
executive retention in that the participants would
forfeit their right to matching shares if they left the
Company after the performance period ended but prior 
to the original Vesting Date of 13 September 2010.
The Committee considered and resolved that the
participants of the CIP would be given the option to
elect to have their matching shares (either in total or in
part) vest at the earlier date of 19 March. However,
participants choosing the earlier vesting date agreed
to forfeit the vested matching shares if they left the
Company's employment in the period prior to the
original Vesting Date of 13 September 2010.
The table on page 36 shows the vesting dates
applicable to each Executive Director.
2010 Co-Investment Plan
As the 2006 CIP matured in 2010 the Committee
developed a replacement long term investment plan in
order to continue to incentivise the Executive Directors
and senior management and to increase alignment
with the requirements of shareholders. Shareholder
approval of the 2010 CIP was granted at the AGM in
May 2010 and awards were made under the scheme
to 14 senior employees during 2010.
The 2010 CIP shares many features with the 2006 CIP
with some changes intended to improve effectiveness.
The 2010 CIP is an annual  rolling' plan with
discretionary share awards made to participants
subject to the approval of the Committee. Participation
is intended to be limited to up to 20 senior employees
(including the Executive Directors) of the Company
and its subsidiaries. Participants receive an award of
shares which will vest after a three-year performance
period, dependent on the achievement of demanding
performance conditions to be set by the Committee
for each award. Participation will be dependent upon
the participant maintaining an investment in the
Company throughout the period between award and
vesting. For Executive Directors, this investment will
be 25% of each award under the CIP . The maximum
award of shares to a participant in a year will be set by
the Committee but will normally be no more than
100% of annual salary. 
Performance Conditions 
The Committee considers that the primary engine for
the creation of long-term shareholder value is
sustained growth in profitability, for which the primary
and most complete measure is earnings per share
(EPS). However, the Committee is keen for the plan to
reward the delivery of shareholder return. For the 2010
awards, 50% of the award will be subject to relative
total shareholder return (TSR) (growth in share price
plus reinvested dividends) and 50% subject to 
EPS growth.  Annual Report and Accounts 2010 33
Whilst the Committee has discretion to determine how
EPS will be calculated for each annual grant, it is
intended that EPS performance for the 2010 awards
will be measured using the method included in the
Notice of Meeting of the 2010 AGM.
If the Company's position in relation to the peer group
places it at or above the 75th percentile then 100% of
the shares tied to TSR will vest. If the Company's
position in relation to the peer group is between the
50th and the 75th percentile the number of award
shares that will vest will vary on a straight line basis
between 30% and 100%. For a position below the
50th percentile no award shares tied to TSR will vest.
The Notice of Meeting which proposed approval by
shareholders of the 2010 CIP included details of the
peer group of media companies to be used in the
assessment of performance. In early 2011 Chrysalis
Group plc was acquired and is no longer listed and
therefore comparative results will not be available.
During 2011 the Committee will consider if Chrysalis
will be replaced in the peer group and, if so, by 
which company. 
VCCP Key Players Incentive Scheme
During 2008 the Company introduced an incentive
scheme for key individuals within the VCCP Group.
Under the Scheme a bonus pool is calculated with
reference to growth in profits of the VCCP Group, the
bonus pool is payable 50% in cash and 50% in
restricted rights over existing Chime Communications
shares. The distribution of the pool is restricted to
senior employees of the VCCP Group. The Scheme
covers the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December
2012. A participant of the Scheme must remain
employed by the Group for a fixed period as
determined by the Committee at the date of grant after
the date of grant for the cash and shares to vest with
the employee. The Scheme allows for a claw-back
facility if the profits of the VCCP Group fall below a
base level of profits. There are no other performance
criteria attached to the cash or restricted shares. 
The Scheme aims to encourage the retention of key
employees within the VCCP Group. All grants under
the Scheme are approved by the Remuneration
Committee. The grants under the Scheme to date
have been relatively modest.
In December 2010 the Committee resolved to grant 
no further awards under the Scheme. From 2011
VCCP executives and staff will be incentivised via the
Company's Deferred Share Plan. 
Share Option Schemes
Previously the Company has operated an Executive
Share Option Scheme for Executive Directors,
subsidiary Board Directors and senior employees.
All executive options granted from November 1997
(other than special executive options) are subject to 
the Group achieving, during the period of grant, an
average total shareholder return on the shares for the
preceding three years which exceeds the average
FTSE 100 total shareholder return for the same period
and a percentage growth in earnings per share which
is at least equal to the percentage growth in the Retail
Price Index plus 6% over three years. The exercise
price of the options granted under the above scheme
is equal to the market value of the Company's shares
at the time when the options were granted. There have
been no grants of Executive Share Options since 2005.
Executive share options are only expected to be
granted in future if there is a contractual commitment
or in exceptional circumstances.
The Company also operates a Savings-Related Share
Option Scheme which is open to all employees after an
initial qualifying period of employment.
Pensions
Pension contributions on behalf of the Executive
Directors are paid by the Company to the Group's
money purchase pension scheme for a personal
pension arrangement up to the value of 20% of their 
basic salary. 
Directors' Interests in Contracts and Other
Transactions with Group Companies
No Director has a material interest in any contract with
any Group company other than a service contract.
Directors' Contracts
The Company's policy is that Executive Directors
should normally be employed on rolling contracts
which may be terminated by the Company giving no
more than 12 months' notice and which otherwise
expires on retirement, currently at age 65 and this is
the case in respect of three of the four Executive
Directors. The Company acknowledges that in October
2011 the default retirement age will be removed and
confirms that alternative arrangements in this respect
will be put in place. In December 2010 the Company
agreed to make an amendment to the service contract
of Lord Bell in order that he may continue as a Director
on a rolling contract without retirement date but
including the 12 month notice of termination provision. 
Any compensation payable on early termination of
employment contracts for the Executive Directors or
any employee would be in line with contractual and
statutory requirements. 34 Chime Communications plc

following appointment and, thereafter by annual re-election. 
There are no provisions for compensation payments on early termination in the Non-Executive Directors' Terms
and Conditions of Appointment.
