Group	Policy	on	the	Remuneration	of	Directors	
and Employees
This Report sets out the Group's Remuneration 
policies for the Directors for the year ended  
31 December 2011. Except where noted, these 
policies are likely to continue to apply in future years, 
unless there are specific reasons for change. It has 
been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to 
the Accounting regulations under the Companies 
Act 2006. The Report also meets the relevant 
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority and describes how the Board 
has applied the principles relating to Directors' 
remuneration in the Combined Code. As required by 
the Act, resolutions to approve this Report and the 
company's financial statements will be proposed at 
the Annual General Meeting. 
The Act requires the auditors to report to the 
Company's members on certain parts of the 
Directors' Remuneration Report and to state whether 
in their opinion those parts of the Report have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting 
Regulations. The Report has therefore been divided 
into separate sections for audited and unaudited 
information. 
Unaudited Information
Remuneration Committee
The composition, chairmanship and activities of  
the Remuneration Committee are set out on pages 
18 and 28. The members of the Committee receive 
remuneration as set out in this report. They abstain 
from participating where their own interests are 
concerned and have no involvement in the day-to-
day management of the Group's operations. Other 
Directors attend meetings by invitation only but this 
would not include when matters relating to their own 
remuneration arrangements are discussed. 
During the financial period under review, the 
Remuneration Committee sought the assistance of 
the Chairman and Chief Operating Officer relating 
to Directors' performance and remuneration. The 
Committee used Towers Watson to provide specialist 
third party advice primarily on competitive market 
levels of remuneration. 
Remuneration Policy
The Group is committed to attracting and retaining 
high quality staff. Remuneration is set at market 
levels and is regularly monitored. The performance 
measurement of the Executive Directors and 
senior staff and the determination of their annual 
remuneration packages are undertaken by the 
Committee. More generally, the Committee reviews 
executive remuneration arrangements regularly to 
ensure that they remain effective, competitive and 
appropriate to the Group's circumstances and 
prospects, and monitors incentive award levels and 
consequent company liabilities. 
Non-Executive	Directors	Remuneration
The fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors during 
2011 are set out on page 38.
Early in 2011 the Board agreed a revised policy for 
the remuneration of its Non-Executive Directors. 
Previously directors were paid a flat fee per annum 
irrespective of differences of responsibility or time 
commitment. A review of similar businesses and 
best practice resulted in the following structure being 
implemented from 1 January 2011.
Senior Independent Non-Executive:  40,000 per annum
Directorship:  25,000
Each Committee membership (additional):  5,000
The Non-Executive Directors do not participate in 
the Company's pension or share option or other 
incentive plans. The Board considers that the Non-
Executive Directors' remuneration conforms with the 
requirements of the Code.
Executive	Director	Remuneration
In 2011 there were five main elements of the 
remuneration packages for Executive Directors:
  basic annual salary and benefits;
  annual bonus payments; 
  deferred share incentives;
  long-term incentive plans; and
  pension arrangements.
Basic Annual Salary and Benefits
In setting salary levels, the Remuneration Committee 
considers the experience and responsibility of the 
Executive Directors and their personal performance 
during the previous year. The Committee also takes 
account of salary levels within other companies 
of a similar size and nature, as well as the rates of 
increases for other employees within the Group. The 
Remuneration Committee reviews salaries with effect 
from January each year.
Three of the four Executive Directors spend a large 
proportion of their time on fee earning client work. 
Their remuneration packages are therefore based on 
the appropriate market rate for two different functions. 
One is the management of the Group in the executive 
roles of Chairman, Deputy Chairman and Chief 
Executive and the other is as client handlers and new 
business winners.
Directors'	Remuneration	Report
                            95 / 109  
Annual Report and Accounts 2011  35
In the 10 years to 31 December 2010 salary 
increases have only been awarded to Mark Smith, 
Group Finance Director (in 2006) and to Christopher 
Satterthwaite, Chief Executive (in 2009) as part of a 
policy to gradually increase the proportion of total 
remuneration based on performance.
From 1 January 2011 salary increases were granted 
to Mark Smith on his promotion to Chief Operating 
Officer and to Lord Bell, Chairman, as it was 
considered that the existing level (which had been  
in place since 2001) had been significantly eroded  
by inflation.
The benefits provided by the Group to the Executive 
Directors consist principally of pension allowance, a 
car or car allowance and private medical insurance.
Annual Bonus
The Executive Directors' annual bonus arrangements 
are focused on the achievement of the Group's 
short term objectives. The annual bonus allocation 
is capped at a maximum of 50% of salary for the 
Executive Directors; of this up to 25% of the relevant 
Director's salary may be payable if the Company 
meets the profit targets set by the Board. A further 
maximum of 25% may be paid to each Executive 
Director, based on performance against personal key 
performance indicators linked to the Group's stated 
strategy and tailored to their individual roles. Some of 
these are non-financial. The Remuneration Committee 
reviews the specific key performance indicators for 
each Director and assesses their overall performance 
both against those indicators and generally. Based 
on this assessment the Committee determines what, 
if any, further bonus is payable. The Committee 
believes the performance metrics chosen align with 
shareholder value creation. Bonus payments are not 
pensionable.
In 2011, the key performance indicators included:
  Growth in operating profit margin
  Growth in income from international work
  Growth in number and value of shared clients
  Growth in average fee per client
  Revenue generation
  Client retention
  Cash management and conversion
  Quality of internal control
  Management of Chime's reputation
  Retention of senior executives
  Management of debtors
  Strength of administrative and financial 
management
The Committee considered the performance of the 
Executive Directors in March 2012. The challenging 
profit targets set by the Committee were not met and 
therefore no bonus payment was approved for that 
element. The Committee also assessed each of the 
Director's achievements against their individual key 
performance indicators. Whilst this indicated generally 
good performance, having regard to decisions made 
on bonus awards to other senior staff, it was agreed 
that no bonus would be paid for this element in 2011.
Deferred	Share	Plan
During 2006 the Company introduced a Deferred 
Share Plan (the Plan). Under the Plan restricted 
rights over existing Chime Communications shares 
are granted to Executive Board Directors, subsidiary 
Board Directors and senior employees of the Group. 
A participant of the Plan must remain employed 
by the Group for a fixed period (as determined by 
the Remuneration Committee at the date of grant) 
after the date of grant for the shares to vest with the 
employee. There are no other performance criteria 
attached to the restricted shares. The Plan aims to 
encourage the retention of key employees. All grants 
under the Plan are approved by the Remuneration 
Committee. The grants under the Plan to date have 
been relatively modest. The Deferred Share Plan 
replaced the Executive Share Option Scheme. There 
are presently grants under the Deferred Share Plans 
that have vesting periods of one, two, and three years.
2010 Co-Investment Plan
The 2010 Plan was approved by shareholders at the 
AGM in May 2010. 
The 2010 Plan is an annual  rolling' plan with 
discretionary share awards made to participants 
subject to the approval of the Committee. 
Participation is intended to be limited to up to 20 
senior employees (including the Executive Directors) 
of the Company and its subsidiaries. Participants 
receive an award of shares which will vest after a 
three-year performance period, dependent on the 
achievement of demanding performance conditions to 
be set by the Committee for each award. Participation 
will be dependent upon the participant maintaining 
an investment in the Company throughout the period 
between award and vesting. For Executive Directors, 
this investment will be 25% of each award under the 
CIP. The maximum award of shares to a participant in 
a year will be set by the Committee but will normally 
be no more than 100% of annual salary.
Performance	Conditions	for	Executive	Directors
The Committee considers that the primary engine 
for the creation of long-term shareholder value is 
sustained growth in profitability, for which the primary 
and most complete measure is earnings per share 
(EPS). However, the Committee is keen for the plan 
to reward the delivery of shareholder return. For the 
2010 and 2011 awards, 50% of the awards were 
                            96 / 109  
36  Chime Communications plc
Directors'	Remuneration	Report
(continued)
subject to relative total shareholder return (TSR) 
(growth in share price plus reinvested dividends) and 
50% subject to EPS growth.
Whilst the Committee has discretion to determine how 
EPS will be calculated for each annual grant, EPS 
performance for the 2010 and 2011 awards will be 
measured using the method included in the Notice of 
Meeting of the 2010 AGM.
If the Company's position in relation to the peer group 
places it at or above the 75th percentile then 100% 
of the shares tied to TSR will vest. If the Company's 
position in relation to the peer group is between the 
50th and the 75th percentile the number of award 
shares that will vest will vary on a straight line basis 
between 30% and 100%. For a position below the 
50th percentile no award shares tied to TSR will vest.
Performance	conditions	-	Non	Board	
Participants (2011 Grant)
In 2011 the Committee reviewed the performance 
conditions for the Plan for future grants to the non-
Board participants. The Committee resolved to 
continue with 50% of any award being measured 
against EPS. The second measurement was revised. 
This will now be set on an individual basis by grant 
in order to incentivise each senior manager to deliver 
stretching targets set by the Board. It is envisaged 
that these may differ from person to person and from 
year to year.
The second element of performance measurement for 
the non-Board participants for the 2011 grant was set 
at the achievement of budgeted operational profit for 
the respective participant's division.
There are no changes to the measurement elements 
for the Executive Directors.
Share	Option	Schemes
Previously the Company has operated an Executive 
Share Option Scheme for Executive Directors, 
subsidiary Board Directors and senior employees.
All executive options granted from November 1997 
(other than special executive options) are subject to 
the Group achieving, during the period of grant, an 
average total shareholder return on the shares for the 
preceding three years which exceeds the average 
FTSE 100 total shareholder return for the same period 
and a percentage growth in earnings per share which 
is at least equal to the percentage growth in the Retail 
Price Index plus 6% over three years. The exercise 
price of the options granted under the above scheme 
is equal to the market value of the Company's shares 
at the time when the options were granted. There 
have been no grants of Executive Share Options since 
2005. Executive share options are only expected 
to be granted in future if there is a contractual 
commitment or in exceptional circumstances.
The Company also operates a Savings-Related Share 
Option Scheme which is open to all employees after 
an initial qualifying period of employment.
Pensions
Pension contributions on behalf of the Executive 
Directors are paid by the Company to the Group's 
money purchase pension scheme for a personal 
pension arrangement up to the value of 20% of their 
basic salary.
Directors'	Interests	in	Contracts	and	Other	
Transactions with Group Companies
No Director has a material interest in any contract with 
any Group company other than a service contract.

Any compensation payable on early termination of employment contracts for the Executive Directors or any 
employee would be in line with contractual and statutory requirements.
There are no provisions for compensation payments on early termination in the Non-Executive Directors' Terms 
and Conditions of Appointment.
Director appointments are subject to Board approval and election by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting following appointment and, thereafter by annual re-election.
Performance Graph
This graph shows the Company's performance measured by total shareholder return, compared with the 
performance of the FTSE 100 and the FTSE All Share Media Index, also measured by total shareholder return. 
The FTSE All Share Media Index has been chosen as the most suitable comparator as it is the general market 
index in which the Group appears.
