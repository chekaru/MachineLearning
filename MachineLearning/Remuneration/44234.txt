Group policy on the remuneration of Directors  
and employees
This Report sets out the Group's remuneration policies for 
the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2012. Except 
where noted, these policies are likely to continue to apply in 
future years, unless there are specific reasons for change. 
It has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the 
Accounting regulations under the Companies Act 2006 (The 
Act ). The Report also meets the relevant requirements of 
the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and 
describes how the Board has applied the principles relating 
to Directors' remuneration in the Combined Code. As 
required by the Act, resolutions to approve this Report and 
the company's financial statements will be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company's 
members on certain parts of the Directors' Remuneration 
Report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of 
the Report have been properly prepared in accordance  
with the Accounting Regulations. The Report has therefore 
been divided into separate sections for audited and 
unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The composition, chairmanship and activities of the 
Remuneration Committee are set out on pages 17 and 28. 
The members of the Committee receive remuneration as set 
out in this report. They abstain from participating where their 
own interests are concerned and have no involvement in the 
day-to-day management of the Group's operations. Other 
Directors attend meetings by invitation only but this would 
not include any occasion when matters relating to their own 
remuneration arrangements are discussed.
During the financial period under review, the Remuneration 
Committee sought the assistance of the Chairman, the Chief 
Executive and Chief Operating Officer relating to Directors' 
performance and remuneration. The Committee used Towers 
Watson to provide specialist third party advice primarily on 
competitive market levels of remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The Group is committed to attracting and retaining high 
quality staff. Remuneration is set at market levels and is 
regularly monitored. The performance measurement of the 
Executive Directors and senior staff and the determination of 
their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the 
Committee. More generally , the Committee reviews executive 
remuneration arrangements regularly to ensure that they 
remain effective, competitive and appropriate to the Group's 
circumstances and prospects, and monitors incentive award 
levels and consequent company liabilities.
Non-Executive Directors remuneration
The fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors during 2012 
are set out on page 38.
The Board remunerates its Non-Executive Directors as 
follows:
Senior Independent Non-Executive:  40,000 per annum 
Directorship:  25,000 per annum
Each Committee membership (additional):  5,000 per 
annum
Additional fees were paid to Rodger Hughes for his role as 
the Chairman of the Special Committee of the Board that 
considered the disposal of the Bell Pottinger businesses 
and on acting as interim Chairman following the resignation 
of Lord Bell (30 June) and prior to the appointment of Lord 
Davies (6 December).
Lord Davies was appointed Chairman on 6 December and 
receives fees of  250,000 per annum of which  50,000 will 
be paid in shares of the Company after the announcement 
of the Company's preliminary results for the period.
WPP nominated Directors are unremunerated.
The Non-Executive Directors do not participate in the 
Company's pension or share option or other incentive plans. 
The Board considers that the Non-Executive Directors' 
remuneration conforms with the requirements of the Code.
Executive Director remuneration
In 2012 there were five main elements of the remuneration 
packages for Executive Directors:
 	 basic	 ann ual	 salar y 	 and 	benefits;
 	 pension 	 ar rangements .
 	 ann ual 	 bon us	pa yments;
 	 def er red 	share	 incentiv es;	 and
 	 long-ter m	incentiv e	 plans .
Basic annual salary and benefits
In setting salary levels, the Remuneration Committee 
considers the experience and responsibility of the Executive 
Directors and their personal performance during the 
previous year . The Committee also takes account of salary 
levels within other companies of a similar size and nature, as 
well as the rates of increases for other employees within the 
Group. The Remuneration Committee reviews salaries with 
effect from January each year .
When considering the salary of Chief Executive, Christopher 
Satterthwaite, the Committee takes into account that a 
proportion of his time is taken on fee earning client work and 
the management of key clients.
Directors' Remuneration Report  
Annual Report and Accounts 2012  35
hime Communications plc
In July 2012 Christopher Satterthwaite was awarded a 
pay increase of  25,000 (revised to  525,000pa). Mark 
Smith was awarded an increase of  50,000 (revised to 
 375,000pa) on the same date. The Committee awarded 
the increases to recognise the additional responsibilities 
transferred to them from the former Executive Chairman and 
Deputy Chairman.
The benefits provided by the Group to the Executive 
Directors consist principally of a car or car allowance and 
private medical insurance.
Pensions
Pension contributions on behalf of the Executive Directors 
are paid by the Company to the Group's money purchase 
pension scheme for a personal pension arrangement up to 
the maximum value of 20% of their basic salary .
Annual bonus
The Executive Directors' annual bonus arrangements are 
focused on the achievement of the Group's short term 
objectives. The annual bonus allocation is capped at a 
maximum of 50% of salary for the Executive Directors; 
of this up to 25% of the relevant Director's salary may be 
payable if the Company meets the profit targets set by the 
Board. A further maximum of 25% may be paid to each 
Executive Director , based on performance against personal 
key performance indicators linked to the Group's stated 
strategy and tailored to their individual roles. Some of these 
are non-financial. The Remuneration Committee reviews 
the specific key performance indicators for each Director 
and assesses their overall performance both against those 
indicators and generally . Based on this assessment the 
Committee determines what, if any , further bonus is payable. 
The Committee believes the performance metrics chosen 
align with shareholder value creation. Bonus payments are 
not pensionable. In 2012, the key performance indicators 
included:
 	 Growth 	in	opera ting 	 profit 	 margin
 	 Growth	in	n umber	 and 	 v alue 	of 	 shared	 c lients
 	 Growth 	in	a v erage	 f ee 	 per	 c lient
 	 R e v en ue 	and	new	c lient 	genera tion
 	 Cash 	management	 and 	 con v er sion
 	 Quality 	of 	 inter nal	 control
 	 R etention 	of 	 senior 	e x ecutiv es
 	 Management 	 of 	de btor s
 	 T he 	strength	of 	 administra tiv e 	 and 	 financial	 management
In February 2013 the Committee assessed the performance 
of the Executive Directors.
The Committee considers 2012 to be an extraordinary year 
due to the completion of a major contract at the end of 
2011; the disposal of the Bell Pottinger Businesses and; the 
formulation and implementation of a revised strategy for the 
Group. The financial results reported in these statements 
reflect that the Directors have ensured that the Company has 
maintained continued good performance without increasing 
exposure to risk. The implementation of the revised strategy 
and the integration of acquisitions whilst presenting unique 
challenges (particularly in an Olympic year) have been dealt 
with successfully .
In considering bonus awards to the two Executive Directors 
the Committee has taken into account awards made to other 
senior staff in the Group; their respective performances in 
2011 and 2012 (bonuses were not paid for 2011 despite profit 
targets being met); the fact that the 2010 Co-investment 
Plan grant will not vest and that the personal KPIs for each 
Director were met or exceeded in a challenging year . 
The Committee has therefore approved the award of bonus 
payments equivalent to 37.5% of salary to each Director .
It is additionally intended that an award under the Deferred 
Share Plan of shares to a purchase value equivalent to 
37.5% of salary will be made after the AGM on 15 May 2013.
The Committee has previously notified shareholders that  
no awards under the Deferred Share Plan would be made 
to the Executive Directors whilst they are members of the 
Co-investment Plan. Both this and the level of the total award 
being 75%, and therefore above the previously notified cap 
on bonus payments, should be put to shareholders prior to 
payment, in order that they may consider , and if appropriate 
approve the level of the awards. 
Deferred Share Plan
During 2006 the Company introduced a Deferred Share 
Plan (the Plan). Under the Plan restricted rights over 
existing Chime Communications shares are granted to 
Executive Board Directors, subsidiary Board Directors and 
senior employees of the Group. A participant of the Plan 
must remain employed by the Group for a fixed period (as 
determined by the Remuneration Committee at the date of 
grant) after the date of grant for the shares to vest with the 
employee. There are no other performance criteria attached 
to the restricted shares. The Plan aims to encourage the 
retention of key employees. All grants under the Plan are 
approved by the Remuneration Committee. The grants under 
the Plan to date have been relatively modest. The Deferred 
Share Plan replaced the Executive Share Option Scheme. 
There are presently grants under the Deferred Share Plan 
that have vesting periods of one, two, and three years. 36  Chime Communications plc
2010 Co-investment Plan
The 2010 Plan was approved by shareholders at the AGM in 
May 2010.
The 2010 Plan is an annual  rolling' plan with discretionary 
share awards made to participants subject to the approval 
of the Committee. Participation is intended to be limited 
to up to 20 senior employees (including the Executive 
Directors) of the Company and its subsidiaries. Participants 
receive an award of shares which will vest after a three-
year performance period, dependent on the achievement 
of demanding performance conditions to be set by the 
Committee for each award. Participation will be dependent 
upon the participant maintaining an investment in the 
Company throughout the period between award and vesting. 
For Executive Directors, this investment will be 25% of each 
award under the 2010 Plan. The maximum award of shares 
to a participant in a year will be set by the Committee but will 
normally be no more than 100% of annual salary .
Performance conditions for Executive Directors
The Committee considers that the primary engine for 
the creation of long-term shareholder value is sustained 
growth in profitability, for which the primary and most 
complete measure is earnings per share (EPS). However , 
the Committee is keen for the plan to reward the delivery of 
shareholder return. For the 2010, 2011 and 2012 awards, 
50% of the awards were subject to relative total shareholder 
return (TSR) (growth in share price plus reinvested 
dividends) and 50% subject to EPS growth.
Whilst the Committee has discretion to determine how EPS 
will be calculated for each annual grant, EPS performance 
for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 awards will be measured  
using the method included in the Notice of Meeting of the 
2010 AGM.
If the Company's position in relation to the peer group 
places it at or above the 75th percentile then 100% of the 
shares tied to TSR will vest. If the Company's position in 
relation to the peer group is between the 50th and the 75th 
percentile the number of award shares that will vest will 
vary on a straight line basis between 30% and 100%. For a 
position below the 50th percentile no award shares tied to 
TSR will vest.
Performance conditions - non-board participants 
In 2011 the Committee reviewed the performance conditions 
for the Plan for future grants to the non-Board participants. 
The Committee resolved to continue with 50% of any award 
being measured against EPS. The second measurement 
was revised. This will now be set on an individual basis by 
grant in order to incentivise each senior manager to deliver 
stretching targets set by the Board. It is envisaged that these 
may differ from person to person and from year to year .
The second element of performance measurement for 
the non-Board participants for the 2011 grant was set at 
the achievement of budgeted operational profit for the 
respective participant's division.
There were no awards to non-board participants in 2012.
Share option schemes
Previously the Company has operated an Executive Share 
Option Scheme for Executive Directors, subsidiary Board 
Directors and senior employees.
All executive options granted from November 1997 
(other than special executive options) are subject to the 
Group achieving, during the period of grant, an average 
total shareholder return on the shares for the preceding 
three years which exceeds the average FTSE 100 total 
shareholder return for the same period and a percentage 
growth in earnings per share which is at least equal to the 
percentage growth in the Retail Price Index plus 6% over 
three years. The exercise price of the options granted 
under the above scheme is equal to the market value of 
the Company's shares at the time when the options were 
granted. There have been no grants of Executive Share 
Options since 2005. Executive share options are only 
expected to be granted in future if there is a contractual 
commitment or in exceptional circumstances.
The Company also operates a Savings-Related Share Option 
Scheme which is open to all employees after an initial 
qualifying period of employment.
Directors' interests in contracts and other transactions 
with Group companies
No Director has a material interest in any contract with any 
Group company other than a service contract. Lord Bell and 
Piers Pottinger , having an interest in the disposal of the Bell 
Pottinger Businesses, did not take part in the consideration 
or the final approval of the transaction.
