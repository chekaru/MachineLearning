The ZTC Telecommunications Plc Unapproved Share Option Plan (the Option Plan ) was established

Board of the Company considers appropriate.

The options granted to Directors and employees over the Company's ordinary shares of 10p and 
outstanding during the year are set out in the Director's Report.

limited resources available to the Company, Frank Lewis agreed that with effect from the AGM held 
on 21 April 2009, his annual remuneration in respect of services to the Company would be reduced to 
 25,000 per annum until the first reverse takeover by the Company.

being the anniversary of their appointment as Non-executive Directors, until the first reverse takeover 
by the Company, payable in Ordinary shares of 1p at a subscription price of 23 pence per Ordinary
