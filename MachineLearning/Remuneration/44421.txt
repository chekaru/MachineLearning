Remuneration Report
The Remuneration Report
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance of the Executive Directors and sets the scale and structure of their 
remuneration including bonus arrangements. The membership of the Committee comprises Clive Donner as Chairman 
together with Karl Watkin and Evan Kirby.
Frank Vanspeybroeck and Marinko Vidovich (via companies connected to them) have fixed term two year service agreements
with Global Resource Ventures Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) to secure their services and expertise
which, in each case, expire on 30 January 2008. The lack of the ability to terminate by notice means that neither of these
agreements comply with the recommended notice periods for the directors set out in the Combined Code. The Remuneration
Committee has considered the terms of these agreements and due to the nature of the business consider them appropriate.
In addition, Frank Vanspeybroeck and Marinko Vidovich have service agreements with the Company that are terminable on six
month's notice.
Remuneration for the period 30 June 2006
