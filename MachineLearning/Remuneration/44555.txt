 Remuneration Report
Remuneration Policy
The aim of the Company's remuneration policy is to reward the performance of the employees and thereby
enhance shareholder value. Remuneration of the Executive of the Company is designed to provide rewards
that will attract and retain high quality executives capable of achieving the Group's performance targets on
both an annual and a long term basis.
At the time of the listing of the Company, it was decided that the remuneration policy then in operation
would remain in place, and that adjustments to that policy would be made at the appropriate time.

and draft the remuneration terms or, if appropriate, suggest changes and reports to the Board for approval.
The Committee also reviews all service contracts for senior staff.
The Board (excluding the Non-Executive Directors) determines the remuneration of Non-Executive
Directors.
