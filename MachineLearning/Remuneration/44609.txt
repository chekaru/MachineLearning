26 CHLORIDE ANNUAL REPORT 2003
This report is presented in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance (the Combined Code) and the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the Regulations).The Regulations require
the auditors to report on the auditable part  of the remuneration report.The
audited information has therefore been separately highlighted.
The Board is responsible for executive remuneration policy and setting non-executive
fees. Responsibility for determining the remuneration packages of executive directors
and other senior executives has been delegated to the Remuneration Committee.
The members of the Remuneration Committee, who are all non-executive 
directors and considered by the Board to be independent of management, are:
N N Broadhurst (Chairman), A S J Fraser, R S Southwell and J A C Wheeler.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice on executive directors'
remuneration and senior executives' remuneration from the Chief Executive and 
the Director of Personnel, neither of whom take part in the determination 
of their own remuneration. Advice was also received from the Company Secretary
in relation to executive service contracts and the Company's share option plans.
Advice was obtained from two external consultants, who were appointed 
by the Remuneration Committee - New Bridge Street Consultants and Hewitt
Bacon & Woodrow Limited. Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow Limited also provided
actuarial services and investment advice to the Chloride 1996 Pension Scheme.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
Policy on remuneration The fees of non-executive directors are determined by 
the Board within limits authorised by the shareholders and in accordance with 
the articles of association of the Company.The policy is to set fees for the non-
executive Chairman and directors at the median level relative to companies with 
a comparable market capitalisation. Fees do not contain any performance-related
element and the non-executive directors do not participate in the Chloride 
Pension Scheme or in the share option schemes. Non-executive directors have no
entitlement to compensation for early termination of their term of appointment.
Details of fees paid to non-executive directors are included in the table headed
Summary of remuneration  on page 29.
Term of appointment The non-executive directors are appointed for specified terms
of approximately three years.Their letters of appointment have no contractual
notice period, but the appointment of each non-executive director is subject to 
re-election by shareholders on retirement by rotation, which occurs every two 
years, or every year in the case of a director aged 65 or over. Details of the
commencement date and duration of the current letters of appointment for 
non-executives are as follows:
Date of the current Unexpired term 
Non-executive director letter of appointment of appointment
N N Broadhurst 30 August 2001 14 months
A S J Fraser 23 May 2001 14 months
R S Southwell 21 January 2002 20 months
J A C Wheeler 25 May 2003 36 months
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
Policy on remuneration The policy is to provide a combination of salary, short 
and long-term incentives and benefits, which form a competitive and appropriate
total remuneration package. Performance-related remuneration in the form of 
annual bonus and share options comprises a significant proportion of the total
remuneration opportunity but is only receivable if stretching performance targets,
which require substantial improvement in financial performance, are achieved.
COMPONENTS OF THE REMUNERATION PACKAGE
Basic salary The basic salary of each executive director is determined taking 
into account the responsibilities and performance of the individual together 
with independently-furnished information on rates for similar jobs in comparable 
industry sectors. In particular, basic salaries are set in comparison with salary levels 
in a group of comparably-sized companies in the electronics sector and other similar
sectors. Details of salaries, bonuses and benefits paid to executive directors are
included in the table headed Summary of remuneration  on page 29.
Annual bonus Chloride operates annual incentive plans for certain employees,
including executive directors. Eligibility for inclusion in such schemes and the
measures of performance to be used are decided annually, taking account of key
business issues.The measure applicable to the incentive plans for executive directors
for the year under review and for 2003/04 is actual adjusted earnings per share
REMUNERATION REPORT CHLORIDE ANNUAL REPORT 2003  27
compared with the previous year. For the executive directors, the maximum award
under the annual incentive plan is 75% of salary. Bonus amounts earned up to 50%
of salary are paid in cash and any bonuses earned above this level are deferred 
into shares which are released two years after the award, subject to the executive
remaining in the Company's employment. As bonuses earned under this plan 
to date, have not exceeded 50% of salary, neither of the executive directors 
is currently entitled to shares in the Company under this plan. Bonuses earned 
by the executive directors under annual incentive plans are not pensionable.
Benefits in kind The taxable benefits provided to executive directors are use 
of a fully-expensed car or car allowance, life insurance and medical cover.
Pensions The executive directors are eligible to be considered for augmented
entitlements under the final salary section of the Chloride 1996 Pension Scheme.
The 1996 Pension Scheme is a funded, contributory, Inland Revenue approved,
occupational pension scheme, which is contracted into the State Earnings Related
Pension Scheme. It provides a pension of up to two-thirds of final pensionable
earnings, depending on service.The 1996 Pension Scheme also provides for
dependants' pensions and lump sums on death in service.
The table headed Pension entitlements  on page 29 shows the retirement benefits,
excluding voluntary contributions, which accrued under the defined benefit section
of the Chloride 1996 Pension Scheme to Messrs Hodgkinson and Warner during the
period under review, together with the total accrued annual pension to which each
director would be entitled under defined benefit arrangements on leaving service.
The amounts of total accrued annual pension are those which would be payable 
at normal retirement age of 62.
Funded unapproved retirement benefit arrangements also apply in respect of
executive directors whose pension benefits are capped under legislation. During 
the year under review, Messrs Hodgkinson and Warner participated in such an
arrangement.The contributions made by the Company to money purchase pension
arrangements for Messrs Hodgkinson and Warner are shown in the table on page 29
headed Summary of remuneration .These arrangements ceased during the year 
and both Messrs Hodgkinson and Warner now receive amounts equivalent 
to these contributions as salary supplements.
Share options The Board believes that the potential for increased share ownership
which is provided by share option schemes is an important element in promoting a
closer alignment of the interests of shareholders and executive directors.The policy
is to make annual grants of share options under the Chloride Group 2001 Executive
Share Option Scheme. Options are normally exercisable between the third and
tenth anniversary of the date of grant, on the condition that the Company's adjusted
earnings per share growth over a period of at least three consecutive financial years
from the date of grant exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index by:
- 3% a year compound for options over shares worth up to 100% of annual
remuneration;
- 4% a year compound for options over shares worth over 100% but not more
than 150% of annual remuneration;
- 7% a year compound for options over shares worth over 150% of annual
remuneration.
If these targets are not satisfied by the fifth anniversary of grant, the share options
will lapse. Adjusted earnings per share as disclosed in the report and accounts was
chosen as the performance condition as it requires substantial improvements in the
Company's underlying financial performance before options may be exercised.
Prior to the Chloride Group 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme, the Company
had previously operated the Chloride Group 1994 Share Option Scheme and the
1996 Share Option Scheme, under which Inland Revenue approved options and,
in the case of the 1996 Scheme, unapproved options, were granted to executive
directors as well as senior executives and are still exercisable. No further options 
will be granted under the 1994 or 1996 Schemes.The outstanding entitlements 
of the executive directors under all schemes are set out in the table on page 30
headed Shares under option . Options are normally exercisable between the third
and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to meeting the performance
measures stated in the notes to the table headed Shares under option  on page 30. POLICY ON EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS OF EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS The current policy is that executive directors should not take on
more than one major outside appointment and then only with the prior approval
of the Board. Fees associated with any such appointment will normally be retained
by the individual.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN The graph set out below shows the
performance of the Company over the past five financial years in terms of 
total shareholder return (TSR), relative to the FTSE Small Cap Index excluding
Investment Companies.The Company has selected this as the comparator
because the Company is a constituent of this index and has used it as a
performance benchmark for a number of years.The graph demonstrates 
the comparative TSR in terms of annual movements.

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Savings-related share option schemes The Company has two outstanding
savings-related schemes, the 1987 Scheme, under which options were last granted
in August 1997, and the 1997 Scheme. Under the 1997 Scheme, options - which
are available to eligible UK employees who contract to save a specified monthly
amount - are not normally exercisable until the expiry of three or, depending 
on an individual's initial election, five or seven years from the contract start date.
The entitlements of the executive directors under these Schemes are set out 
in the table on page 30 headed Shares under option .
CONTRACTS OF SERVICE It is the Company's policy to limit notice periods
under service contracts of executive directors to a maximum of one year, in
accordance with current market practice. Accordingly this policy applies to the
appointment of any new executive director. At 1 April 2003, the applicable notice
period required to be given by the Company under the service contracts of
Messrs Hodgkinson and Warner was two years. In order to comply with the
Company's policy, these notice periods are now reducing on a monthly basis to
one year by 1 April 2004. No compensation payments will be made to executive
directors relating to the reduction of their contractual notice periods.
Mr Hodgkinson and Mr Warner last signed a contract of employment on
1 December 1991 and 23 April 1997 respectively. In the event of termination,
each of the executive directors would be entitled to salary, pension benefits,
payments in lieu of FURBS and benefits in kind for the period of notice applicable
at the time of termination (23 months at the date of this report, decreasing to 
12 months by 1 April 2004). In an appropriate case the directors would have regard
to the departing director's duty to mitigate loss, except in the event of dismissal
following a change of control of the Company. On termination by the Company
in those circumstances, the executive directors would be entitled to receive 
a prescribed payment made up of salary and benefits for the period of notice
including a bonus payment of 20% of basic salary, which is the level of bonus
payable under the executives' annual incentive plan for on-target performance.
No compensation payments were made to executive or non-executive directors
during the year. CHLORIDE ANNUAL REPORT 2003 29
