 This report is presented in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Combined Code) and 
the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the Regulations).
The Regulations require the auditors to report on the auditable part 
of the remuneration report.The audited information has therefore been
separately highlighted.
The Board is responsible for executive remuneration policy and setting 
non-executive fees including the Chairman's fees. Responsibility for agreeing
remuneration policy with the Board and determining the remuneration packages
of executive directors and other senior executives has been delegated to the
Remuneration Committee.The members of the Remuneration Committee are
N N Broadhurst (Chairman) and the following non-executive directors who 
are considered by the Board to be independent of management: A S J Fraser,
R S Southwell and J A C Wheeler.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice on remuneration
of executive directors and senior executives from the Chief Executive and the
Director of Personnel, neither of whom take part in the determination of their
own remuneration. Advice was also received from the Company Secretary 
in relation to the Company's share option plans. Advice was obtained from 
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP , who were appointed by the Remuneration
Committee to advise on executive remuneration and long-term incentive
arrangements.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
Policy on remuneration The fees of non-executive directors and the non-
executive Chairman are determined by the Board within limits authorised 
by the shareholders and in accordance with the articles of association of the
Company.The policy is to set fees at the median level relative to companies
with a comparable market capitalisation. Fees do not contain any performance-
related element and the non-executive directors do not participate in the
Chloride Pension Scheme or in the share option schemes. Non-executive
directors have no entitlement to compensation for early termination of their
term of appointment.
Details of fees paid to non-executive directors, including the Chairman, are
included in the table headed Summary of remuneration  on page 33.
Term of appointment The non-executive directors are appointed for specified
terms of three years or less.Their letters of appointment have no contractual
notice period, but the appointment of each non-executive director is subject 
to re-election by shareholders on retirement by rotation, which occurs every
two years, or every year in the case of a director aged 65 or over. Details of 
the commencement date and duration of the current letters of appointment 
for non-executives are as follows:
Date of the current Unexpired term
Non-Executive Director letter of appointment of appointment
N N Broadhurst 31 March 2004 38 months
A S J Fraser 31 March 2004 26 months
R S Southwell 21 January 2002 8 months
J A C Wheeler 25 May 2003 24 months
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
Policy on remuneration The policy is to provide a combination of salary,
short and long-term incentives and benefits, which form a competitive and
appropriate total remuneration package. Performance-related remuneration in
the form of annual bonus and share options comprises a significant proportion
of the total remuneration opportunity but is only receivable if stretching
performance targets, which require substantial improvement in financial
performance, are achieved.
ANNUAL REPORT 2004 29
REMUNERATION REPORT COMPONENTS OF THE REMUNERATION PACKAGE
Base salary The base salary of each executive director is determined taking 
into account the responsibilities and performance of the individual together 
with independently furnished information on rates for similar jobs in comparable
industry sectors. In particular, base salaries recognise salary levels in a group of
comparably sized companies in the electronics sector and other similar sectors.
Details of salaries, bonuses and benefits paid to executive directors are included
in the table headed Summary of remuneration  on page 33.
Annual bonus Chloride operates annual incentive plans for certain employees,
including executive directors. Eligibility for inclusion in such schemes and the
measures of performance to be used are decided annually, taking account of 
key business issues. For the year under review and for 2004/05, the measure
applicable to the incentive plans for executive directors is actual adjusted
earnings per share compared with the previous year. For the executive directors,
the maximum award under the annual incentive plan is 75% of base salary.
Bonus amounts earned up to 50% of base salary are paid in cash and any
bonuses earned above this level are deferred into shares which are released
two years after the award, subject to the executive remaining in the Company's
employment. As bonuses earned under this plan to date have not exceeded
50% of base salary, neither of the executive directors is currently entitled to
shares in the Company under this plan. Bonuses earned by the executive
directors under annual incentive plans are not pensionable.
Benefits in kind The taxable benefits provided to executive directors are use 
of a fully-expensed car or car allowance, life insurance and medical cover.
Pensions The executive directors are eligible to be considered for augmented
entitlements under the final salary section of the Chloride 1996 Pension
Scheme.The 1996 Pension Scheme is a funded, contributory, Inland Revenue
approved, occupational pension scheme, which is contracted into the State
Earnings Related Pension Scheme. It provides a pension of up to two-thirds 
of final pensionable earnings, depending on service.The 1996 Pension Scheme
also provides for dependants' pensions and lump sums on death in service.
The table headed Pension entitlements  on page 33 shows the retirement
benefits, excluding voluntary contributions, which accrued under the defined
benefit section of the Chloride 1996 Pension Scheme to Mr Hodgkinson and 
Mr Warner during the period under review, together with the total accrued
annual pension to which each director would be entitled under defined benefit
arrangements on leaving service.
The pension benefits of Mr Hodgkinson and Mr Warner are capped 
under legislation and both Mr Hodgkinson and Warner now receive salary
supplements in lieu of contributions to funded unapproved retirement benefit
arrangements.The amount of these payments is shown in the table on page 33
headed Summary of remuneration .
EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEMES 
Policy The Board believes that the potential for increased share ownership
which is provided by share-based incentive schemes is an important element 
in promoting a closer alignment of the interests of shareholders and executive
directors.The policy is to make annual grants of share options. In addition the
Board encourages executive directors to build and maintain holdings of shares 
in the Company.
Current scheme The current scheme is the Chloride Group 2001 Executive
Share Option Scheme (ESOS). Options granted under this scheme up 
to 31 March 2004 are normally exercisable between the third and tenth
anniversaries of the date of grant, on condition that the Company's adjusted
earnings per share growth over a period of at least three consecutive financial
years from the date of grant exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Prices 
Index by:
  3% a year compound for options over shares worth up to 100% of annual
remuneration (base salary plus bonus);
  4% a year compound for options over shares worth over 100% but not
more than 150% of annual remuneration; and
  7% a year compound for options over shares worth over 150% of annual
remuneration.
30 ANNUAL REPORT 2004
REMUNERATION REPORT continued
SUPPLIER OF CHOICE FOR POWER PROTECTION SOLUTIONS  If these targets are not satisfied by the fifth anniversary of grant, the share options
lapse. Adjusted earnings per share as disclosed in the report and accounts was
chosen as the basis for the performance condition as achievement of the
growth in EPS necessary before options may be exercised would require a
substantial improvement in the Company's underlying financial performance.
Proposed introduction of the performance share plan and changes to the
ESOS The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the policy on share options
with its independent advisers, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP , and consulted
with its largest institutional shareholders.This has resulted in a proposal, details
of which are set out in the letter and notice of meeting accompanying the
report and accounts, to introduce the Chloride Group PLC Performance Share
Plan (PSP), in conjunction with changes to the ESOS. Following approval of the
PSP by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in July 2004, the policy will
be to make annual grants of share options under the ESOS, together with
annual awards under the PSP .
There will be a combined individual limit on the aggregate value of awards that
can be made to a participant under both ESOS and PSP in any financial year.
The combined individual limit will be 2.0 times base salary per annum.Within
this combined limit a mix of ESOS options and PSP awards can be made and
for this purpose two ESOS options will be equal to one PSP award.The effect 
is that a participant cannot receive more value under a combination of ESOS
and PSP grants than he could under only one plan.
Under PSP , awards may be granted to participants, including the executive
directors, which will become exercisable if stretching total shareholder return
(TSR) performance targets, underpinned by EPS growth targets, are met over 
a fixed performance period of three financial years.The TSR target compares 
the Company's TSR with that of constituents of the FTSE Small Cap Index
(excluding investment banks) and will reward good relative performance.
The annual limit on awards under the PSP will be 1.0 times base salary.
In addition to the introduction of the PSP , the Company intends to make the
following changes to the ESOS:
  If performance targets are not met at the third anniversary of the date 
of grant, there will be no retesting and the options will lapse.
  The maximum value of annual grants will be reduced from 2.0 times annual
remuneration (base salary and bonus) to 2.0 times annual basic salary
(subject to the combined limit described above).
  Annual base salary will be used instead of annual remuneration to determine
the applicable performance targets within the range set out above.
These changes will come into effect for options granted under the ESOS 
from 1 April 2004. A copy of the letter and notice of meeting setting out 
further details of the PSP can be found on the Company's website,
www.chloridegroup.com.
Previous executive share option schemes Prior to the Chloride Group 2001
Executive Share Option Scheme, the Company operated the Chloride Group
1994 Share Option Scheme and the 1996 Share Option Scheme, under 
which Inland Revenue approved options and, in the case of the 1996 Scheme
unapproved options, were granted to executive directors as well as senior
executives and are still exercisable. No further options will be granted under the
1994 or 1996 schemes.The outstanding entitlements of the executive directors
under all schemes are set out in the table on page 34 headed Shares under
option . Options granted under the 1994 and 1996 Schemes are normally
exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant,
subject to meeting the performance measures stated in the notes to the table
headed Shares under option  on page 34.
ANNUAL REPORT 2004 31 SAVINGS-RELATED SHARE OPTION SCHEMES The Company has two
outstanding savings-related schemes, the 1987 Scheme, under which options
were last granted in August 1997, and the 1997 Scheme. Under the 1997
Scheme, options - which are available to eligible UK employees who contract to
save a specified monthly amount - are not normally exercisable until the expiry
of three or, depending on an individual's initial election, five or seven years from
the contract start date.The entitlements of the executive directors under these
Schemes are set out in the table on page 34 headed Shares under option .
CONTRACTS OF SERVICE Each of the executive directors has a rolling
contract of employment, terminable on 12 months' notice if terminated by the
Company and six months' notice if terminated by the director.
Mr Hodgkinson and Mr Warner last signed a contract of employment on 
1 December 1991 and 23 April 1997 respectively. In the event of termination by
the Company, each of the executive directors would be entitled to 12 months'
salary, pension benefits, payments in lieu of FURBS and benefits in kind. In an
appropriate case the Company would have regard to the departing director's
duty to mitigate loss. However, in the event of dismissal following a change of
control of the Company, each executive director would be entitled to receive 
a prescribed payment made up of 12 months' salary and benefits including 
a bonus payment of 20% of basic salary.
No compensation payments were made to executive or non-executive
directors during the year.
POLICY ON EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS OF EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS The current policy is that executive directors should not take 
on more than one major outside appointment and then only with the prior
approval of the Board. Fees associated with any such appointment will 
normally be retained by the individual.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN The graph set out below shows the
performance of the Company over the last five financial years in terms of 
total shareholder return (TSR), relative to the FTSE Small Cap Index excluding
Investment Companies.The Company has selected this as the comparator
because the Company is a constituent of this index and has used it as a
performance benchmark for a number of years.The graph demonstrates 
the comparative TSR in terms of annual movements.
