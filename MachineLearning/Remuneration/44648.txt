 ANNUAL REPORT 2005 33
This report is presented in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Combined Code) and
the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the Regulations).
The Regulations require the auditors to report on the auditable part 
of the remuneration report.The audited information has therefore been
separately highlighted.
The Board is responsible for executive remuneration policy and setting
non-executive fees including the Chairman's fees. Responsibility for agreeing
remuneration policy with the Board and determining the remuneration
packages of executive directors and other senior executives has been
delegated to the Remuneration Committee.The members of the
Remuneration Committee are N N Broadhurst (Chairman) and the 
following non-executive directors who are considered by the Board to be
independent of management: A S J Fraser, R S Southwell and J A C Wheeler.
The Remuneration Committee operates under detailed terms of 
reference, copies of which are available on request.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice on
remuneration of executive directors and senior executives from the Chief
Executive and the Director of Personnel, neither of whom take part in the
determination of their own remuneration. Advice was also received from
the Company Secretary in relation to the Company's share option plans.
Advice was obtained from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (NBSC),
who were appointed by the Remuneration Committee to advise on
executive remuneration, and long-term incentive arrangements, including
employee share schemes. NBSC have no other connection with the Company.
Non-executive directors
Policy on remuneration The fees of non-executive directors and the non-
executive Chairman are determined by the Board within limits authorised
by the shareholders and in accordance with the Articles of Association 
of the Company.The policy is to set fees at the median level relative to
companies with a comparable market capitalisation. Fees do not contain 
any performance-related element and the non-executive directors do 
not participate in the Chloride Pension Scheme or in the share option or
performance share schemes. Non-executive directors have no entitlement
to compensation for early termination of their term of appointment.
Details of fees paid to non-executive directors, including the Chairman,
are included in the table headed Summary of remuneration  on page 37.
Term of appointment The non-executive directors are appointed for
specified terms of three years or less.Their letters of appointment have 
no contractual notice period, but the appointment of each non-executive
director is subject to re-election by shareholders on retirement by rotation,
which occurs every two years, or every year in the case of a director aged
65 or over. Details of the commencement date and duration of the current
letters of appointment for non-executives are as follows:
Date of the current Unexpired term

N N Broadhurst 31 March 2004 26 months
A S J Fraser 31 March 2004 14 months

Executive directors
Policy on remuneration The policy is to provide a combination of salary,
short- and long-term incentives and benefits, which form a competitive and
appropriate total remuneration package. Performance-related remuneration
in the form of annual bonus, together with share options and performance
shares, comprises a significant proportion of the total remuneration
opportunity but is only receivable if stretching performance targets,
which require substantial improvement in financial performance and, in the
case of performance shares, superior total shareholder return, are achieved.

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Components of the remuneration package
Base salary The base salary of each executive director is reviewed annually,
taking into account the responsibilities and performance of the individual
together with independently furnished information on rates for similar jobs
in comparable industry sectors. In particular, base salaries recognise salary
levels in a group of comparably-sized companies in the electronics sector
and other similar sectors. Details of salaries, bonuses and benefits paid 
to executive directors are included in the table headed Summary of
remuneration  on page 37.The current basic salary levels of the executive
directors with effect from 1 April 2005 are:
K H Hodgkinson -  338,000
N W Warner -  223,500
These represent an increase of 3% since 2004/05.
Annual bonus Chloride operates annual incentive plans for certain
employees, including executive directors. Eligibility for inclusion in such
schemes and the measures of performance to be used are decided
annually, taking account of key business issues. For the year under review
and for 2005/06, the measure applicable to the incentive plans for
executive directors is actual adjusted earnings per share compared with 
the previous year. For the executive directors, the maximum award under
the annual incentive plan is 75% of base salary. Bonus amounts earned up
to 50% of base salary are paid in cash and any bonuses earned above this
level are deferred into shares which are released two years after the award,
subject to the executive remaining in the Company's employment. Bonus
shares were earned by the executive directors under this plan, in respect 
of the year ending 31 March 2005. Bonuses earned by the executive
directors under annual incentive plans are not pensionable.
Benefits in kind The taxable benefits provided to executive directors are
use of a fully-expensed car or car allowance, life insurance and medical cover.
Pensions The executive directors are eligible to be considered for
augmented entitlements under the final salary section of the Chloride 
1996 Pension Scheme.The 1996 Pension Scheme is a funded, contributory,
Inland Revenue-approved, occupational pension scheme, which is contracted
into the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme. It provides a pension of 
up to two-thirds of final pensionable earnings (up to a retirement age of 62),
depending on service.The 1996 Pension Scheme also provides for
dependants' pensions and lump sums on death in service.
The table headed Pension entitlements  on page 37 shows the 
retirement benefits, excluding voluntary contributions, which accrued 
under the defined benefit section of the Chloride 1996 Pension Scheme 
to Mr Hodgkinson and Mr Warner during the period under review,
together with the total accrued annual pension to which each director
would be entitled under defined benefit arrangements on leaving service.
The pension benefits of Mr Hodgkinson and Mr Warner are capped 
under legislation and both Mr Hodgkinson and Warner now receive salary
supplements in lieu of contributions to funded unapproved retirement
benefit arrangements.The amount of these payments is shown in the 
table on page 37 headed Summary of remuneration .
Executive share incentive schemes
Policy The Board encourages executive directors to build and maintain
holdings of shares in the Company and believes that the potential for
increased share ownership which is provided by share-based incentive
schemes is an important element in promoting a closer alignment of the
interests of shareholders and executive directors.The policy is to make
annual grants of share options and performance shares, with a combined
annual aggregate limit on the value of shares under award of two times
basic salary.The effect of this overall limit is that an individual cannot receive
more value under a combination of Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards
and Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) grants than he could have  ANNUAL REPORT 2005 35
under only one plan. In calculating the value of awards, a performance share
is deemed equal to two ESOS awards. For example, an individual could
receive a maximum option grant of 200% of salary or a performance share
grant of 100% of salary. Alternatively, he could receive a 100% option grant
and a 50% performance share grant to receive the maximum level of
award per annum.
Share option scheme The current share option scheme is the Chloride
Group 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme. Options granted under this
scheme are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries
of the date of grant, on condition that the Company's adjusted earnings per
share (EPS) growth over a period of at least three consecutive financial
years from the date of grant exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Prices
Index by:
l 3% a year compound for options over shares worth up to 100% 
of annual remuneration base salary;
l 4% a year compound for options over shares worth over 100% 
but not more than 150% of base salary; and
l 7% a year compound for options over shares worth over 150% 
of base salary.
In the case of options granted before 31 March 2004, if these targets 
are not satisfied by the fifth anniversary of grant, the share options lapse.
In the case of options granted after 31 March 2004, options will lapse if 
the performance condition is not achieved by the third anniversary of grant.
Adjusted EPS as disclosed in the report and accounts was chosen as the
basis for the performance condition because achievement of the growth in
EPS necessary before options may be exercised would require a substantial
improvement in the Company's underlying financial performance.
In the transitional period in moving to International Accounting Standards,
the Remuneration Committee will ensure the EPS targets are appropriately
calculated to ensure consistency.
Performance Share Plan During the year, following shareholder approval,
the Company introduced a Performance Share Plan.The maximum annual
value of shares which can be granted under the PSP is 100% of salary.
Awards granted under the PSP are normally exercisable on the third
anniversary of the date of the award, to the extent that a total shareholder
return (TSR) performance target is met over a fixed performance period of
three financial years.The TSR target compares the Company's TSR with that
of constituents of the FTSE Small Cap Index (excluding investment trusts).
Awards vest as follows:
Chloride's ranking % of awards which vest
Below median 0%
Median 30%
Between median and straight line between
upper quartile 30% and 100%
Upper quartile 100%
In addition, no awards will vest under the PSP unless the Company's EPS
growth is at least equal to the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 2% pa
over the performance period.
Previous executive share option schemes Prior to the Chloride Group
2001 Executive Share Option Scheme, the Company operated the
Chloride Group 1994 Share Option Scheme and the 1996 Share Option
Scheme, under which Inland Revenue-approved options and, in the case of
the 1996 Scheme unapproved options, were granted to executive directors
as well as senior executives and are still exercisable. No further options 
will be granted under the 1994 or 1996 schemes. Options granted under
the 1994 and 1996 schemes are normally exercisable between the third
and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to meeting the
performance measures stated in the notes to the table headed Shares
under option  on page 38. Policy on external appointments of executive directors
The current policy is that executive directors should not take on more
than one major outside appointment and then only with the prior approval
of the Board. Fees associated with any such appointment will normally be
retained by the individual. During the year, Mr Hodgkinson received and
retained fees of  35,000 from his non-executive directorship of De La Rue
plc. Mr Warner received and retained fees of  20,750 from his non-
executive directorship of Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC.
Total shareholder return
The graph set out below shows the performance of the Company over 
the last five financial years in terms of total shareholder return (TSR),
relative to the FTSE Small Cap Index excluding Investment Trusts.The
Company has selected this as the comparator because the Company 
is a constituent of this index and has used it as a performance benchmark
for a number of years.The graph demonstrates the comparative TSR in
terms of annual movements.A graph showing comparative TSR over the two
years ended 31 March 2005 is included in the financial review on page 19.

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
The outstanding entitlements of the executive directors under all schemes
are set out in the table on page 38 headed Shares under option .
Savings-related share option schemes
The Company has two outstanding savings-related schemes, the 1987
Scheme, under which options were last granted in August 1997, and the
1997 Scheme. Under the 1997 Scheme, options - which are available to
eligible UK employees who contract to save a specified monthly amount -
are not normally exercisable until the expiry of three or, depending on an
individual's initial election, five or seven years from the contract start date.
The entitlements of the executive directors under these schemes are set
out in the table on page 38 headed Shares under option .
Contracts of employment
Each of the executive directors has a rolling contract of employment,
terminable on 12 months' notice if terminated by the Company and 
six months' notice if terminated by the director.
Mr Hodgkinson and Mr Warner last signed a contract of employment 
on 1 December 1991 and 23 April 1997 respectively. In the event of
termination by the Company, each of the executive directors would be
entitled to 12 months' salary, pension benefits, benefits in lieu of FURBS 
and benefits in kind. In an appropriate case the Company would have
regard to the departing director's duty to mitigate loss. However, in the
event of dismissal following a change of control of the Company, each
executive director would be entitled to receive a prescribed payment 
made up of 12 months' salary and benefits including a bonus payment 
of 20% of basic salary.
No compensation payments were made to executive or non-executive
directors during the year.
