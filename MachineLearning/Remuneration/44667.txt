 INTRODUCTION
This report is presented in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Combined Code) and the
Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the Regulations).The Regulations require the auditors to report on the auditable part  of the remuneration
report.The audited information has therefore been separately highlighted.
Responsibilities The role and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are set out in written terms of reference based on the best practice model
published by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, which are available on request and include the following:
l determination of the policy for remuneration of the executive directors and designated senior managers;
l determination of individual remuneration packages for the executive directors and designated senior managers;
l consideration of executive directors' service agreements, pensions and related matters;
l making recommendations to the Board on the design of share incentive plans; and
l exercise of all powers and discretions of the directors in connection with the Company's savings-related and executive share option schemes.
Fees of the non-executive Chairman and the non-executive directors are determined by the Board.
Membership The Remuneration Committee is made up of non-executive directors, whom the Board considers to be independent.The members of the
Remuneration Committee during the year were Robin Southwell (Chairman), Gary Bullard (appointed 5 September 2005), Angus Fraser and Eric Tracey
(appointed 5 September 2005). Norman Broadhurst (resigned from the Committee 5 September 2005) and John Wheeler (resigned 19 July 2005) were 
also members of the Committee during the year.
Advisers During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice on remuneration of executive directors and senior executives from the Chief
Executive and the Director of Personnel, neither of whom take part in the determination of their own remuneration. Advice was also received from the
Company Secretary in relation to the Company's share option plans. Advice was obtained from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (NBSC), who were
appointed by the Remuneration Committee to advise on executive remuneration, and long-term incentive arrangements, including employee share schemes.
NBSC have no other connection with the Company.
Effectiveness Review During the year, the Remuneration Committee reviewed its effectiveness through a process of written reviews and discussion, led 
by the Committee Chairman.The Remuneration Committee considered that it had the right mix of skills and experience to perform its responsibilities, but
recognised that Norman Broadhurst's continuing chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee was not in accordance with best practice.The Board appointed
Mr Southwell as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee in July 2005 and Mr Broadhurst stepped down from the Committee following the appointment 
of Eric Tracey and Gary Bullard in September 2005.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Policy on remuneration The fees of non-executive directors and the non-executive Chairman are determined by the Board and normally reviewed every
two years, the last review having taken place in January 2005.The policy is to set fees at the median level relative to companies with a comparable market
capitalisation. Fees do not contain any performance-related element and the non-executive directors do not participate in the Chloride Pension Scheme or in
the share option or performance share schemes. Additional fees are paid for chairmanship of the Audit and Remuneration Committees, reflecting the additional
workload and responsibility of these appointments. Non-executive directors have no entitlement to compensation for early termination of their term of
appointment, and take no part in the determination of their own remuneration.
Details of fees paid to non-executive directors, including the Chairman, are included in the table headed Summary of remuneration  on page 38.
T erm of appointment The non-executive directors are appointed for specified terms of approximately three years.Their letters of appointment have no
contractual notice period, and the appointment of each non-executive director is subject to re-election by shareholders on retirement by rotation, which occurs
every two years, or every year in the case of a director aged 65 or over.The dates from which the respective letters of appointment came into effect are as
follows: Norman Broadhurst - 31 March 2004; Gary Bullard - 1 September 2005; Angus Fraser - 31 March 2004; Robin Southwell - 21 January 2005 and 
Eric Tracey - 1 September 2005.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT ANNUAL REPORT 2006 35
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Policy on remuneration The policy is to provide a combination of salary, short- and long-term incentives and benefits, which form a competitive and fair
total remuneration package. Performance-related remuneration in the form of annual bonus, together with share options and performance shares, comprises 
a significant proportion of the total remuneration opportunity but is only receivable if stretching performance targets, which require substantial improvement 
in financial performance and, in the case of performance shares, superior total shareholder return, are achieved.
COMPONENTS OF THE REMUNERATION PACKAGE
Base salary The base salary of each executive director is reviewed annually, taking into account the responsibilities and performance of the individual together
with independently furnished information on rates for similar jobs in comparable industry sectors. In particular, base salaries recognise salary levels in a group of
comparably-sized companies in the electronics sector and other similar sectors. Details of salaries, bonuses and benefits paid to executive directors are included
in the table headed Summary of remuneration  on page 38.The current basic salaries of the executive directors with effect from 1 April 2006 are:
K H Hodgkinson  355,000
N W Warner  230,000
These represent an increase of approximately 5% for Keith Hodgkinson and 3% for Neil Warner since 2005/06.
Annual bonus Chloride operates annual incentive plans for certain employees, including executive directors. Eligibility for inclusion in such schemes and 
the measures of performance to be used are decided annually, taking account of key business issues. For the year under review and for 2006/07, the financial
measure applicable to the incentive plans for executive directors is actual adjusted earnings per share compared with the previous year. In 2006/07, for the
Group Finance Director and other senior executives, 50% of bonus will also be dependent on achievement of personal objectives, in addition to the financial
target. For the executive directors, the maximum award under the annual incentive plan is 75% of base salary. Bonus amounts earned up to 55% of base salary
are paid in cash. If the bonuses exceed this level, then any bonus earned above 50% of base salary is deferred into shares which are released after two years,
subject to the executive director remaining in the Company's employment. Outstanding bonus shares earned by the executive directors under the deferred
bonus plan are included in the table headed Interests under share plans  on page 40. Bonuses earned by the executive directors under annual incentive plans
are not pensionable.
Benefits in kind The taxable benefits provided to executive directors are use of a fully-expensed car or car allowance, life insurance and medical cover.
Pensions The executive directors are members of the final salary section of the Chloride 1996 Pension Scheme (the 1996 Scheme ).This scheme is a 
funded, contributory, HMRC-approved, occupational pension scheme, which is contracted into the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme. It provides a pension
of up to two-thirds of final pensionable earnings (up to normal retirement age under the Scheme), depending on service.The 1996 Scheme also provides for
dependants' pensions and lump sums on death in service.
The table headed Pension entitlements  on page 38 shows the retirement benefits, excluding voluntary contributions, which accrued under the defined benefit
section of the 1996 Scheme to Keith Hodgkinson and Neil Warner during the period under review, together with the total accrued annual pension to which
each director would be entitled under defined benefit arrangements on leaving service.
With effect from 6 April 2006, the 1996 Scheme has adopted a cap on pensionable salary, in place of the statutory earnings cap, which is cost neutral to the
Company.The pension benefits of Keith Hodgkinson and Neil Warner are subject to this cap and they each receive salary supplements in relation to salary 
in excess of the cap.The amount of these payments is shown in the table on page 38 headed Summary of remuneration . EXECUTIVE SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEMES
Policy The Board encourages executive directors to build and maintain holdings of shares in the Company and believes that the potential for increased share
ownership which is provided by share-based incentive schemes is an important element in promoting closer alignment of the interests of shareholders and
executive directors.The policy is to make annual grants of share options and performance shares, with a combined annual aggregate limit on the value of 
shares under award of two times basic salary.The effect of this overall limit is that an individual cannot receive more value under a combination of Performance
Share Plan (PSP) awards and Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) grants than he could have under only one plan. In calculating the value of awards,
a performance share is deemed equal to two ESOS awards. For example, an individual could receive a maximum option grant of 200% of salary or 
a performance share grant of 100% of salary. Alternatively, he could receive a 100% option grant and a 50% performance share grant to receive the 
maximum level of award per annum.
Share option scheme The current share option scheme is the Chloride Group 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme. Options granted under this scheme
are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant, on condition that the Company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS)
growth over a period of at least three consecutive financial years from the date of grant exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index by:
l 3% a year compound for options over shares worth up to 100% of annual remuneration base salary;
l 4% a year compound for options over shares worth over 100% but not more than 150% of base salary; and
l 7% a year compound for options over shares worth over 150% of base salary.
In the case of options granted before 31 March 2004, if these targets are not satisfied by the fifth anniversary of grant, the share options lapse. In the case of
options granted after 31 March 2004, options will lapse if the performance condition is not achieved by the third anniversary of grant. Adjusted EPS as disclosed
in the report and accounts was chosen as the basis for the performance condition because achievement of the growth in EPS necessary before options may be
exercised would require a substantial improvement in the Company's underlying financial performance.
Following the move to International Accounting Standards, the Remuneration Committee ensures the EPS targets are appropriately calculated to 
ensure consistency.
Performance Share Plan The Company also operates a Performance Share Plan.The maximum annual value of shares which can be granted under the 
PSP is 100% of salary.
Awards granted under the PSP are normally exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of the award, to the extent that a total shareholder return (TSR)
performance target is met over a fixed performance period of three financial years.The TSR target compares the Company's TSR with that of constituents of
the FTSE Small Cap Index (excluding investment trusts). Awards vest as follows:
Chloride's ranking % of awards which vest
Below median 0%
Median 30%
Between median and upper quartile straight line between 30% and 100%
Upper quartile 100%
In addition, no awards will vest under the PSP unless the Company's EPS growth is at least equal to the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 2% p.a. over the
performance period.
Previous executive share option schemes Prior to the Chloride Group 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme and the Performance Share Plan, the Company
operated the Chloride Group 1994 Share Option Scheme and the 1996 Share Option Scheme, under which HMRC-approved options and, in the case of the
1996 Scheme unapproved options, were granted to executive directors as well as senior executives and are still exercisable. No further options will be granted
under the 1994 or 1996 schemes. Options granted under the 1994 and 1996 Schemes are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of
the date of grant, subject to meeting the performance measures stated in the notes to the table headed Interests under share plans  on page 39.

SAVINGS-RELATED SHARE OPTION SCHEME 
The Company operates a savings-related share option scheme - the 1997 Scheme. Under the scheme, options - which are available to eligible UK employees
who contract to save a specified monthly amount - are not normally exercisable until the expiry of three or, depending on an individual's initial election,
five years from the contract start date.
The outstanding interests of the executive directors under all executive share option schemes, the Performance Share Plan and the savings-related share
scheme are set out in the table starting on page 39 headed Interests under share plans .
CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT 
Each of the executive directors has a rolling contract of employment, terminable on 12 months' notice if terminated by the Company and six months' notice 
if terminated by the director.
Keith Hodgkinson and Neil Warner last signed a contract of employment on 1 December 1991 and 23 April 1997 respectively. In the event of termination by
the Company, each of the executive directors would be entitled to 12 months' salary, pension benefits, salary supplement in lieu of FURBS and benefits in kind.
In an appropriate case the Company would have regard to the departing director's duty to mitigate loss. However, in the event of dismissal following a change
of control of the Company, each executive director would be entitled to receive a prescribed payment made up of 12 months' salary and benefits including 
a bonus payment of 20% of basic salary.
No compensation payments were made to executive or non-executive directors during the year.
POLICY ON EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The current policy is that executive directors should not take on more than one major outside appointment and then only with the prior approval of the
Board. Fees associated with any such appointment will normally be retained by the individual. During the year, Keith Hodgkinson received and retained fees 
of  37,000 from his non-executive directorship of De La Rue plc. Neil Warner received and retained fees of  23,250 from his non-executive directorship 
of Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN
The graph set out below shows the performance of the Company over the last five financial years in terms of total shareholder return (TSR), relative to the
FTSE Small Cap Index excluding Investment Trusts.The Company has selected this as the comparator because the Company is a constituent of this index and
has used it as a performance benchmark for a number of years.The graph demonstrates the comparative TSR in terms of annual movements. A graph showing
comparative TSR over the three years commencing 1 April 2003 is included in the financial review on page 21.

1 The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement under the terms of the Chloride 1996 Pension Scheme based on service to 31 March 2006.
2 The transfer values (and their increases) in columns 5, 7, 8 and 9 have been calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
3 The difference between the transfer value increase shown in column 5 and column 9 arises from a change in the date of calculation of transfer values.
4 From 1 April 2006, the normal retirement age for directors is 65. Mr Hodgkinson reached his normal retirement age of 62 (for 1996 Scheme purposes only) on 15 November 2005
and ceased to pay contributions and accrue pension from that date. He is entitled to a pension under the 1996 Scheme, increased for late payment, on his actual retirement.
The transfer values shown in the above table are a liability of the 1996 Scheme.The above table combines the disclosures required by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority and the Directors' Remuneration Regulations 2002.
