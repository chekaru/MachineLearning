Introduction
This report is presented in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Combined Code) and the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the Regulations).The Regulations require the auditors to report on the auditable part  of the remuneration report.
The audited information has therefore been separately highlighted.
Responsibilities The role and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are set out in written terms of reference based on the best practice model published
by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, which are available on the Company's website and include the following:
 
determination of the policy for remuneration of the executive directors and designated senior managers;
 
determination of individual remuneration packages for the executive directors and designated senior managers;
 
consideration of executive directors' service agreements, pensions and related matters;
 
making recommendations to the Board on the design of share incentive plans; and
 
exercise of all powers and discretions of the directors in connection with the Company's savings-related and executive share option schemes.
Membership The Remuneration Committee is made up of non-executive directors, whom the Board considers to be independent.The members of the Remuneration
Committee during the year were Robin Southwell (Chairman), Gary Bullard and EricTracey. In addition, following publication of the revised Combined Code in June 2006,
the Chairman, Norman Broadhurst was appointed as a member of the Committee.
Advisers During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice on remuneration of executive directors and senior executives from the Chief Executive and
the Director of Human Resources, neither of whom took part in the determination of their own remuneration.Advice was also received from the Company Secretary
in relation to the Company's share option plans.Advice was obtained from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (NBSC), who were appointed by the Remuneration
Committee to advise on executive remuneration, and long-term incentive arrangements, including employee share schemes. NBSC has no other connection with
the Company.
Effectiveness review During the year, the Remuneration Committee reviewed its effectiveness through a process of written reviews and discussion, led by the
Committee Chairman.The Remuneration Committee considered that it had the right mix of skills and experience to perform its responsibilities.
Non-executive directors
Policy on remuneration The fees of non-executive directors and the Chairman are determined by the Board and were reviewed during the year in accordance with
the Company's normal two-year review cycle.The policy is to set fees at the median level relative to companies with a comparable market capitalisation. Fees do not
contain any performance-related element and the non-executive directors do not participate in the Chloride Pension Scheme or in the share option or performance
share schemes.Additional fees are paid for chairmanship of the Audit and Remuneration Committees, reflecting the additional workload and responsibility of these
appointments. Non-executive directors have no entitlement to compensation for early termination of their term of appointment, and take no part in the determination
of their own remuneration.
Fees of the Chairman and the non-executive directors are determined by the Board. Details of these fees are included in the table headed Summary of remuneration 
on page 40.
T erm of appointment The non-executive directors are appointed for specified terms of approximately three years.Their letters of appointment have no contractual
notice period, and the appointment of each non-executive director is subject to re-election by shareholders on retirement by rotation, which occurs every two years,
or every year in the case of a director aged 65 or over.The dates on which the respective letters of appointment came into effect are as follows: Norman Broadhurst
- 3 April 2007; Gary Bullard - 1 September 2005; Robin Southwell - 21 January 2005 and EricTracey - 1 September 2005.
Executive directors
Policy on remuneration The policy is to provide a combination of salary, short and long-term incentives and benefits, which form a competitive and fair total
remuneration package. Performance-related remuneration in the form of annual bonus, together with share options and performance shares, comprises a significant
proportion of the total remuneration opportunity but is only receivable if stretching performance targets, which require substantial improvement in financial
performance and, in the case of performance shares, superior total shareholder return, are achieved.
Tim Cobbold joined the Company on 1 June 2007 as Chief Operating Officer and as an executive director. In addition to participating in the performance-related
long and short-term incentive plans, pension scheme and benefits in kind, he will receive payments over the first two years of his employment to assist with the
transition from his previous employment.The Committee considers these payments, which total circa  130,000 per annum, to be reasonable having regard to the
need to attract the best candidate for this demanding role.

ANNUAL REPORT 2007
Components of the remuneration package
Base salary The base salary of each executive director is reviewed annually, taking into account the responsibilities and performance of the individual together
with independently furnished information on rates for similar jobs in comparable industry sectors. In particular, base salaries recognise salary levels in a Group of
comparably-sized companies in the electronics sector and other similar sectors. Details of salaries, bonuses and benefits paid to executive directors during the year
are included in the table headed Summary of remuneration  on page 40.The current basic annual salaries of the executive directors with effect from 1 April 2007
(from 1 June 2007 forTim Cobbold) are:
K H Hodgkinson  370,000
N W Warner  240,000
T R Cobbold  240,000
These represent an increase of 4.2% for Keith Hodgkinson and 4.3% for Neil Warner since 2006/2007.
Annual bonus Chloride operates annual incentive plans for certain employees, including executive directors. Eligibility for inclusion in such schemes and the measures
of performance to be used are decided annually, taking account of key business issues. For the year under review and for 2007/2008, the financial measure applicable
to the incentive plans for executive directors is actual adjusted earnings per share compared with the previous year. In 2006/2007 for the Group Finance Director
and other senior executives, up to 25% of maximum bonus was dependent on achievement of personal objectives, in addition to the financial target. For the executive
directors, the maximum award under the annual incentive plan is 75% of base salary. Bonus amounts earned up to 55% of base salary are paid in cash. If the bonuses
exceed this level, then any bonus earned above 50% of base salary is deferred into shares which are released after two years, subject to the executive director
remaining in the Company's employment. Outstanding bonus shares earned by the executive directors under the deferred bonus plan are included in the table
headed Interests under share plans  starting on page 41. Bonuses earned by the executive directors under annual incentive plans are not pensionable.
Benefits in kind The taxable benefits provided to executive directors during the year under review were use of a fully-expensed car or car allowance, life insurance
and medical cover.
Pensions During the year, Keith Hodgkinson and Neil Warner were members of the final salary section of the Chloride 1996 Pension Scheme (the 1996 Scheme ).
This Scheme is a funded, contributory, HMRC-approved, occupational pension scheme, which is contracted into the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme. It provides
a pension of up to two-thirds of final pensionable earnings (up to normal retirement age under the Scheme), depending on service.The 1996 Scheme also provides for
dependants' pensions and lump sums on death in service.
The table headed Pension entitlements  on page 41 shows the retirement benefits, excluding voluntary contributions, which accrued under the defined benefit section
of the 1996 Scheme to Keith Hodgkinson and Neil Warner, during the year, together with the total accrued annual pension to which each of them would be entitled
under defined benefit arrangements on leaving service.
With effect from 6 April 2006, the 1996 Scheme has adopted a cap on pensionable salary, in place of the statutory earnings cap, which is cost neutral to the Company.
The pension benefits of Keith Hodgkinson and Neil Warner are subject to this cap and they each received salary supplements in relation to salary in excess of the cap.
The amount of these payments is shown in the table on page 40 headed Summary of remuneration .
Executive share incentive schemes
Policy The Board encourages executive directors to build and maintain holdings of shares in the Company and believes that the potential for increased share
ownership which is provided by share-based incentive schemes is an important element in promoting closer alignment of the interests of shareholders and executive
directors.The policy is to make annual grants of share options and performance shares, with a combined annual aggregate limit on the value of shares under award
of two times basic salary.The effect of this overall limit is that an individual cannot receive more value under a combination of Performance Share Plan awards and
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) grants than he could have under only one plan. In calculating the value of awards, a performance share is deemed equal
to two ESOS awards. For example, an individual could receive a maximum option grant of 200% of salary or a performance share grant of 100% of salary.
Alternatively, he could receive a 100% option grant and a 50% performance share grant to receive the maximum level of award per annum.
Share option scheme The current share option scheme is the Chloride Group 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme. Options granted under this scheme are
normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant, on condition that the Company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth over
a period of at least three consecutive financial years from the date of grant exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index by:
 
3% a year compound for options over shares worth up to 100% of base salary;
 
4% a year compound for options over shares worth over 100% but not more than 150% of base salary; and
 
7% a year compound for options over shares worth over 150% of base salary.
In the case of options granted after 31 March 2004, options will lapse if the performance condition is not achieved by the third anniversary of grant.Adjusted EPS as
disclosed in the report and accounts was chosen as the basis for the performance condition because achievement of the growth in EPS necessary before options may
be exercised would require a substantial improvement in the Company's underlying financial performance. 39
Following the move to International Accounting Standards, the Remuneration Committee ensures that the EPS targets are appropriately calculated to ensure consistency.
Performance Share Plan The Company also operates a Performance Share Plan (PSP).The maximum annual value of shares which can be granted under the
PSP is 100% of salary.
Awards granted under the PSP are normally exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of the award, to the extent that a total shareholder return (TSR)
performance target is met over a fixed performance period of three financial years.TheTSR target compares the Company'sTSR with that of constituents of the
FTSE Small Cap Index (excluding investment trusts).Awards vest as follows:
Chloride's ranking % of awards which vest
Below median 0%
Median 30%
Between median and upper quartile straight line between 30% and 100%
Upper quartile 100%
In addition, no awards will vest under the PSP unless the Company's EPS growth is at least equal to the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 2% p.a. over the
performance period.
Previous executive share option schemes Prior to the Chloride Group 2001 ESOS and the PSP , the Company operated the Chloride Group 1994 Share Option
Scheme and the 1996 Share Option Scheme, under which HMRC-approved options and, in the case of the 1996 Scheme unapproved options, were granted to
executive directors as well as senior executives and are still exercisable. No further options will be granted under the 1994 or 1996 schemes. Options granted under
the 1994 and 1996 Schemes are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to meeting the performance measures
stated in the notes to the table headed Interests under share plans  on page 41.
Savings-related share option scheme
The Company operates a savings-related share option scheme - the 1997 Scheme, which expires in July 2007. Under the scheme, options - which are available to
eligible UK employees who contract to save a specified monthly amount - are not normally exercisable until the expiry of three or, depending on an individual's initial
election, five years from the contract start date.
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting the Board is seeking approval to introduce a new savings-related share option scheme, details of which are set out in the
accompanying Notice of Meeting.
The outstanding interests of the executive directors under all executive share option schemes, the PSP and the savings-related share scheme are set out in the table
starting on page 41 headed Interests under share plans .
Contracts of employment
Each of the executive directors has a rolling contract of employment, terminable on 12-months' notice if terminated by the Company and six-months' notice if
terminated by the director.
Keith Hodgkinson and Neil Warner last signed a contract of employment on 1 December 1991 and 23 April 1997 respectively.Tim Cobbold has signed a contract
of employment, with a commencement date of 1 June 2007, which became unconditional at the end of March 2007. In the event of termination by the Company, each
of the executive directors would be entitled to 12-months' salary, pension benefits, salary supplement and benefits in kind. In an appropriate case the Company would
have regard to the departing director's duty to mitigate loss. However, in the event of dismissal following a change of control of the Company, each executive director
would be entitled to receive a prescribed payment made up of 12 months' salary and benefits including a bonus payment of 20% of basic salary.
No compensation payments were made to executive or non-executive directors during the year.
Policy on external appointments of executive directors
The current policy is that executive directors should not take on more than one major outside appointment and then only with the prior approval of the Board.
Fees associated with any such appointment will normally be retained by the individual. During the year, Keith Hodgkinson received and retained fees of  42,000
from his non-executive directorship of De La Rue plc. Neil Warner received and retained fees of  26,250 from his non-executive directorship of Dechra
Pharmaceuticals PLC.
ANNUAL REPORT 2007 Total shareholder return
The graph set out below shows the performance of the Company over the last five financial years in terms ofTSR, relative to the FTSE Small Cap Index excluding
InvestmentTrusts.The Company has selected this as the comparator because the Company is a constituent of this index and has used it as a performance benchmark
for a number of years.The graph demonstrates the comparativeTSR in terms of annual movements.
This graph shows the value, by 31 March 2007, of  100 invested in Chloride PLC on 31 March 2002 compared with the value of  100
invested in the FTSE Small Cap Index (excluding InvestmentTrusts).The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year ends.

1 The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement under the terms of the Chloride 1996 Pension Scheme based on service to 31 March 2007.
2 The transfer values (and their increases) in columns 6, 8, 9 and 10 have been calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
3 The difference between the transfer value increase shown in column 6 and column 10 arises from a change in the date of calculation of transfer values.
4 The normal retirement age for directors is 65, but benefits accrued before 31 March 2006 can be drawn unreduced from age 62.The transfer values assume that Mr Warner retires at age 62 and that Mr Hodgkinson
retires immediately.
The transfer values shown in the above table are a liability of the 1996 Scheme.The above table combines the disclosures required by the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority and the Directors' Remuneration Regulations 2002.
