 Christian Salvesen PLC Annual Report 2003 18
This report sets out the company's executive remuneration policy and structure and details of the remuneration received by the
directors in respect of the year ended 31 March 2003. Shareholders will be invited to approve this report at the Annual General
Meeting to be held on 9 July 2003.
Remuneration Committee: composition, responsibilities and operation
(this part of the Remuneration Report is not required to be audited)
The membership of the Remuneration Committee is entirely non-executive and the members are listed on page 14. No member has
any personal financial interest other than as a shareholder in the matters to be decided, or any potential conflicts of interest arising
from cross-directorships, nor has any member any day-to-day responsibility for running individual businesses of the Group. The
Committee's principal function is to determine the company's policy on remuneration for its most senior executives and to approve
the specific remuneration of the executive directors and the secretary, including their service contracts. Its remit therefore includes, 
but is not restricted to, basic salary, benefits in kind, performance related awards, share options and share awards, long term incentive
schemes, pension rights and any other compensation or termination payments. In exercising its responsibilities, the Committee has
access to professional advice from the Head of Group Human Resources (Mr J J Paterson for part of the year, new appointment
pending) and the Group Compensation and Benefits Manager, who also coordinate and collate external advice on remuneration. 
The Committee received external advice during the year from Mercer Human Resources Consulting and following the year end 
from New Bridge Street Consultants. The Committee also consults with the Chief Executive about its proposals.
Remuneration policy 
(this part of the Remuneration Report is not required to be audited)
The company's policy is to attract, retain and motivate high quality senior managers with a competitive package of salary, retirement
benefits and share and performance related awards. Market rates will determine the range of remuneration levels for a particular job,
and an individual's position in that range will reflect the overall contribution to business performance. The principal components of
remuneration packages are:
Salary
In arriving at the basic salary element the evaluation of an executive's responsibilities is based on a well established external
assessment system which takes into account the know-how required to do the job, the problem solving and decision-making involved
and the overall impact on the business. This assessment enables comparison to be made with the salary levels in over 400 companies
in the industrial and service sector in the UK. The salary levels suggested by this primary data source are also checked against a
number of specialist functional and industry sector surveys. When setting salary levels, account is taken of the impact of salary on
other elements of remuneration, particularly pensions.
Short term incentives
Executive directors and senior executives participate in an annual performance award scheme. The scheme enables a maximum
performance award of up to 50% of salary to be paid to executive directors, which is not pensionable, for superior performance
against pre-determined targets based upon an increase in earnings per share ( EPS') before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation.
There were no payments for 2002/03 in respect of the EPS scheme. The criteria for awards to certain senior executives who are not
members of the board also incorporate an element of performance against individual objectives. The appropriateness of this scheme
will be reviewed by the Committee, in conjunction with external remuneration consultants, during the forthcoming year.
Long term incentives
The company believes that employee share schemes encourage the matching of interests between employees and shareholders.
Executive directors and senior executives are able to participate, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, in the Executive
Share Option Scheme approved by shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 26 September 1997.
New participants in the Executive Share Option Scheme would not normally be awarded options until they have been employed 
for at least 12 months. The initial base award is determined by the individual's level of seniority and past performance and ordinarily
comprises options with a market value at the date of grant of between  10,000 and 2.5 times salary. The frequency of subsequent
grants is limited to intervals of two years unless an individual has had a significant increase in job responsibility. Ongoing allocations
of executive share options are based on salary multiples which reflect the value of the role in the organisation. The maximum multiple
of four times salary in aggregate for all options held is applicable to executive directors.
UK participants in the Executive Share Option Scheme receive part of their entitlement under a scheme which has received Inland
Revenue approval. The Treasury limit for outstanding options under the approved scheme is currently  30,000 for each participant,
with the balance of any award being held under an unapproved scheme. The schemes are subject to limits relating to the total number
of shares under option at any one time and the price payable on exercise. 
The executive options granted during the financial year were subject to performance conditions based on both total shareholder
return ( TSR') and growth in normalised earnings per share ( EPS'). TSR is calculated by reference to the increase in the company's
share price assuming reinvestment of dividends paid. Graphs showing TSR for the past five years against comparator indices appear 
in the next section.
At the time when the individual wishes to exercise the option (which can only normally occur after three years have elapsed since
grant), the company's TSR since the date of grant of the option is compared to that of the FTSE Mid 250 Index (excluding investment
trusts). If the company's TSR matches or exceeds that index and the company's EPS growth, over a period of three consecutive years,
matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index by 9%, the option is capable of exercise. The performance conditions are
kept under review by the Remuneration Committee and it is currently felt that they continue to be challenging, appropriate and
aligned to shareholder interests. Any awards made to executive directors in 2003/04 will be subject to the same scheme limits and
performance conditions outlined above. Unexercised Executive Share Options lapse on the resignation of an executive.
Remuneration report Christian Salvesen PLC Annual Report 2003 19
The executive directors also participate in the all employee share ownership plan ( AESOP'), which is open to all employees with three
months' service, and the SAYE Share Option Schemes, which were open to all employees with one year of service on the date the
relevant schemes were launched.
Retirement benefits
UK executive directors are eligible for the executive scale of benefits of the Christian Salvesen Pension Scheme (the  Scheme'), which is
a funded final salary scheme approved by the Inland Revenue. Subject to Inland Revenue regulations and limits, its key elements are:
  a normal retirement age of 60;
  a maximum benefits accrual rate of 1/30th for each year's service up to a maximum of two thirds of final pensionable salary;
  an employee contribution rate of 6% of pensionable salary;
  a lump sum death in service benefit of four times salary;
  spouse's pension on death; and
  early retirement pension based on a 3% simple reduction factor.
Where directors are subject to the Earnings Cap, it is the company's current policy to pay over to such members, by way of
compensation, the equivalent of what it would have cost the company during the year to fund the benefits for that year of service,
based on basic salary, beyond the cap. 
Further, where Inland Revenue limits may restrict the accrual of Scheme benefits for any executive director to less than 1/30th of 
the Earnings Cap for each year of service, the director can agree to take a lower benefit from the Scheme. The company has paid
additional compensation in respect of this reduction in benefit.
There are no immediate plans to change the company's policy on retirement benefits for the executive directors, although the
Committee has noted the contents of the recent Green Paper on pensions and will be reviewing the position once the effect of any
legislative changes in this area have been clarified.
Performance graphs (this part of the Remuneration Report is not required to be audited)
The first graph below illustrates the performance of the company over the past five years measured by TSR, compared with the return
achieved by the FTSE Mid 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) (the  Index') over the same period. The Index is considered the
most appropriate benchmark because it is used as the comparator group for the performance conditions attached to the exercise of
Executive Share Options outlined above. The second graph illustrates the performance of the company on the same basis against the
FTSE Transport Index, of which the company has been a constituent throughout the five-year period.

Service contracts and notice periods (this part of the Remuneration Report is not required to be audited)
The executive directors have service agreements that require one year's notice from the individual and two years' notice from the
company. The contracts of the existing executive directors were entered into in 1997 for Mr Roderick and 1998 for Mr Aspden, at a
time when such contracts were common. However, the Remuneration Committee has reviewed the position with regard to any future
service agreements in light of the joint statement of best practice on executive contracts and severance published jointly by the
Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds in December 2002 and has determined that no future
contracts will contain ongoing notice periods in excess of one year.
Under the existing service agreements the company has the right to terminate employment on paying basic salary in lieu of the
contractual notice period.
Non-executive directors do not have service agreements and, in accordance with the company's articles of association, their
appointments may be terminated without compensation at any time. Christian Salvesen PLC Annual Report 2003 20
External appointments (this part of the Remuneration Report is not required to be audited)
The company recognises that executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that such
appointments may broaden their knowledge and expertise to the benefit of the company. Therefore, executive directors are permitted
with the agreement of the board to take up an appointment as a non-executive director of another organisation, subject to there being
no conflict of interest and to the time spent being reasonable. The director may, subject to the agreement of the board, retain the fees
from such an appointment. During the year Mr Roderick was appointed as a non-executive director of Heywood Williams PLC.

P G Aspden** 7,830 1,740 63,830 45,320 13,400 1,630 12,900 2,190
Notes:
* The benefits for Mr Roderick are accruing at a rate of 1/45th for each year of service. 
** The benefits for Mr Aspden are accruing at a rate of 1/60th for each year of service.
(a) The accrued pension entitlement is the amount that the director would receive if he retired at the year end. 
(b) The additional accrued benefit earned in the year is the difference between the accrued benefit at the year end and that at the previous year end.
(c)(d)Transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11. The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets
that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension service provider on transferring the Scheme's liability in respect of the directors' pension benefits. They do not represent sums 
payable to individual directors and, therefore, cannot meaningfully be added to annual remuneration.
(e) The increase in the transfer value is the increase in the transfer value of the accrued benefits during the year after deducting the director's personal contributions to the Scheme.
(f) The additional accrued benefit is the difference between the accrued benefit at the year end and the accrued benefit at the previous year end indexed by inflation.
(g) The transfer value of the increase in accrued benefits, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value of the increase in accrued benefits that the director has earned in the period, whereas 
the change in his transfer value (e), required by the Companies Act, discloses the absolute increase or decrease in transfer value and includes the change in value of the accrued benefits that result 
from market volatility affecting the transfer value at the beginning of the period, as well as the additional value earned in the year. 
No pension is accruing or has been paid in the period in respect of any director other than Mr Roderick or Mr Aspden.
As indicated earlier the pension arrangements of Mr Roderick and Mr Aspden were based upon membership of the Scheme. However,
they are both subject to the Earnings Cap and received payments based on the amount that it would otherwise have cost the company
during the year to fund their pension benefits arising from that year of service. Death in service benefit cover was also provided,
outside the Scheme arrangements, on salary above the Cap. In addition to the emoluments shown above as directors of the company
throughout the year they received the following payments/benefits:

The options under the Executive Share Option Schemes are normally only exercisable, providing performance conditions are met,
after a period of three years has elapsed from date of grant. 
Apart from those noted above no other directors have been granted share options in the shares of the company or other Group
entities. None of the terms or conditions of the share options was varied during the year. 
The options were granted at nil cost to the directors and were in respect of past performance. The performance criteria for all the
above share options were consistent with the remuneration policy outlined on page 18.
The market price of the shares at 31 March 2003 was 33.5p and the range during the financial year was 33p to 103p.
