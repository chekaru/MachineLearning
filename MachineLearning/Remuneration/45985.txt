 REMUNERATION
REPORT
Introduction
As a member of AIM the Company is not obliged to comply with the provisions of the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. However,
as part of its commitment to best practice, the Company adheres to the principles of good governance when deciding remuneration strategy and 
has delegated responsibility for remuneration policy to the Remuneration Committee.
Composition and responsibilities 
The Remuneration Committee meets at least twice a year and its broad responsibility is to ensure that the remuneration packages of the executive
directors and senior management are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate managers of high quality. The Remuneration
Committee comprises Laurence Vaughan (as chairman) and Mark Pearman. The Remuneration Committee considers what comparable companies are
paying in setting annual salaries, incentive schemes, pension arrangements and car and health care benefits.
Remuneration policy
The policy of the Group on directors' remuneration is to provide competitive market-based packages which reward Group and individual performance.
Remuneration packages comprise a basic salary, annual performance-related bonus, pensions and other benefits and, where appropriate,
participation in the share incentive plans set out below. Salaries and bonuses are reviewed annually and any changes effected from 1 October.
The Group introduced a number of share incentive schemes on flotation, of which all members of staff, including the executive directors are 
potential beneficiaries.
The board determines the remuneration of the chairman and the other non-executive directors. Non-executive directors are not involved in decisions
about their own remuneration.
Service contracts
The executive directors are subject to rolling contracts. These contracts maybe terminated by either the Company or the relevant executive director
giving 12 months' notice. Payments on termination for executive directors are restricted to the value of salary and contractual benefits for the notice
period. There are no predetermined special provisions for executive directors with regard to compensation in the event of loss of office.
The non-executive directors are appointed by letters of appointment which may be terminated by either the Company or the relevant non-executive
director giving three months' notice. In the event of termination the payment of the basic fee would be payable to the non-executive director for the
notice period.
Bonus schemes
Executive directors are eligible for annual performance related bonus payments which are based on appropriate Group profit and cash generation
performance and are subject to the Remuneration Committee's approval. The maximum bonus payable is capped at 74% of the executive directors'
basic salaries. Bonus payments are not pensionable.

award has been made would vest.
