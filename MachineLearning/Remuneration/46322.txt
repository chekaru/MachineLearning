Directors' remuneration report
This report to shareholders provides information on the remuneration and share interests of all Clarkson PLC directors and the criteria by
which that remuneration has been determined. It has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 Sch 7A and the
applicable Listing Rules. 
Remuneration and nomination committee 
The remuneration and nomination committee comprises the independent non-executive directors - Bob Benton and Martin Clark. 
Martin Watson chaired the committee until his resignation from the Board and was succeeded by Bob Benton. None of the committee
members have day-to-day involvement with the business nor do they have any personal financial interest in the matters to be
recommended. Steve Deasey, company secretary, acts as secretary to the committee. The number of formal meetings held and the
attendance by each member is shown in the table on page 28. The committee also held informal discussions as required. 
The committee is responsible, on behalf of the Board, for: 
  setting the senior executives' remuneration policy; 
  reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and shareholders; 
  approving the design of, and recommending targets for, any performance-related pay schemes the company operates; 
  considering the granting of options and allocation of share scheme awards; 
  approving the total quantum of company earnings related incentive rewards; 
  recommending to the Board appointments for the role of chairman, chief executive officer, executive and non-executive directors. 
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP ( NBSC') are appointed by the committee to provide independent advice and services that materially
assist the committee in their consideration of matters relating to directors' remuneration, design of share incentive plans and
measurement of performance against vesting targets. NBSC has no other connection with the company. 
Remuneration policy 
The policy of the company is to ensure that executive rewards are linked to performance, to provide an incentive to achieve the key
business aims, deliver an appropriate level of total remuneration for acceptable performance and maintain a reasonable relationship of
rewards to those offered in other competitor companies in order to attract, retain and motivate executives within the bounds of what is
acceptable to shareholders. 
There are few comparable UK public companies involved solely in the business of providing shipping and related wholesale financial
services. Comparisons are therefore made with City-based companies in the financial services sector and private companies in the
shipping sector, many of which are headquartered overseas. In the highly competitive global labour market which operates within the
shipping services sector, the retention of key talent is critical to continued business success. Remuneration levels are set to attract, and
retain, the best talent and to ensure that market competitive rewards are available for the delivery of strong business and personal
performance. The remuneration committee is advised by NBSC on the issue of comparability with the benchmark companies. 
The remuneration committee seeks to structure total remuneration packages which align the interests of shareholders and senior executives.
Directors' remuneration will be the subject of regular review in accordance with this policy in the next and following financial years. 
It is recognised by the remuneration committee that the current management team is highly regarded and would be attractive to our
competitors in the shipping industry and, increasingly, broader wholesale financial services businesses. Retention of key talent in this
context is critical (whilst recognising the need for appropriate succession planning). 
The proportionate breakdown of the total remuneration is such that, in line with most other financial services companies, a very high
proportion of the package is performance-related. For instance, in 2007 around 75%-80% of executive directors' total remuneration was
derived from performance-related pay.
Non-executive directors' remuneration is set by the chairman, chief executive and finance director with guidance from NBSC. 
Base salary 
Base salary is reviewed annually and is determined by reference to individual responsibilities, performance and external market data.
Therefore it is set to reflect the experience, responsibility, effectiveness and market value of the executive. 
Benefits 
The principal taxable benefits for executive directors are the provision of car allowances, pension allowances and healthcare insurance.  Directors' remuneration report continued
Annual performance bonus and Long Term Incentive Plan 
The remuneration committee considers that the performance-related elements of the executive directors' packages (normally consisting
of annual cash bonuses and annual grants over shares calculated based on the market value at the date or dates of grant) give the
executive directors the potential to receive appropriate annual rewards, but only if significant value has been delivered to shareholders. It
is therefore considered that, in terms of providing motivation to the executive directors to deliver improved shareholder value, the
performance-related elements of the directors' packages are critical. 
It is essential that, where appropriate given the skills and responsibilities of the individual, executive directors' performance-based
remuneration is designed to reward the executive commensurately with their potential rewards in comparator companies. 
The committee designs the incentive structure to: 
  align the executives' interests with those of shareholders through equity based incentives; 
  provide an incentive structure with improved  lock-in' of key executives; 
  ensure the total incentive award is market competitive; 
  be stretching in terms of achievement of targets. 
Annual bonus 
In 2007 executive directors participated in a bonus scheme which was linked principally to the achievement of group earnings per share
targets with the balance based on pre-determined personal objectives. The maximum performance targets were exceeded in 2007 and
this element of the bonus was paid in full, however the element linked to personal objectives was restricted by the remuneration
committee, with the agreement of the directors. 
In common with most City-based financial institutions, annual bonus is not subject to a formal cap. Instead, performance criteria are
calibrated carefully each year to ensure that the total bonus pool and individual allocations within the pool are not excessive. For 2008,
the annual bonus has been recalibrated so as to require incremental progression in profit to deliver an equivalent level of bonus. There is
also a profit  floor' below which no bonus is triggered under the formula. 
Long Term Incentive Plan 
The plan comprises a HMRC approved part and an unapproved part and allows senior executives to be granted options and/or
performance share awards. There is an annual limit of 150% of basic salary for performance share awards or 450% of basic salary for
options. It is intended that awards of performance shares will be granted in 2008, which will vest on the third anniversary of grant. 
For awards made in 2008, the performance conditions are based on the following three elements (as to 50% for the EPS part, 25% for
the TSR part and 25% for the element based on profit vs the Baltic Dry Exchange Index (BDI)] each): 
EPS - to reflect EPS growth of the company. Awards under this element will be measured against the UK Retail Price Index ( RPI') over a
period of three financial years. Awards will vest 100% should earnings per share growth exceed RPI plus 8% per annum, and 25%
should EPS growth exceed RPI plus 4% per annum. Awards will vest pro rata between these two levels. 
TSR - to reflect performance relative to the stock market. Awards under this element will be based on total shareholder return, measured
over a three-year performance period. Awards will vest 100% should the Company's TSR be in the top quartile of the companies
comprising the FTSE Small Cap index, and 25% of the award will vest should TSR equal the median of the FTSE Small Cap index.
Awards will vest pro rata between these two levels. 
Profit versus the BDI - to reflect performance of the Company's core shipping-related activities (which still account for a significant
proportion of revenues). This will provide a focussed incentive on performance against the core shipping market. Awards will vest 100%
should the movement in the Company's pre-tax profit exceed the BDI by a margin calibrated prior to grant so as to be broadly equivalent
to upper quartile performance and the top end of the EPS range. 25% of the award will vest for performance equal to the BDI.
The above targets will be reviewed annually. Share awards will be made annually following the publication of the annual results. 
The shares would normally vest three years from the award date provided that the executive is still employed by the company and the
company's performance met the relevant targets over the three year period.

Total shareholder return
This graph shows total shareholder return (that is, share price growth assuming reinvestment of any dividends) of the company over the past
five financial years compared to the FTSE Small Cap Index, which the committee considers an appropriate index for comparison purposes. 
Policy on directors' employment terms 
The company's policy on directors' employment terms is that: 
  Executive directors should have rolling service contracts terminable on no more than one year's notice served by the company or the
director; and 
  Non-executive directors are appointed by letter of appointment for a fixed term not exceeding three years, renewable on the agreement
of both the company and the director. 
The normal retirement date for executive directors is 65. The normal retirement date for non-executive directors is 70. 
There are no predetermined provisions for compensation on termination within executive directors' service agreements, which exceed
one year's emoluments. In the event of early termination of the contracts, the company reserves the right to pay in lieu of notice an
amount equivalent to his basic salary, contractual benefits and annual bonus for the notice period. 
The policy on termination payments is that the company does not normally make payments beyond its contractual obligations, including
any payment in respect of notice to which a director is entitled.

Martin Stopford transferred his benefits out of the scheme on 30 August 2006. 
Basic salary is the only element of remuneration which is pensionable under the defined benefit scheme.
The pension entitlement shown is that which is paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year or date of ceasing to
be a director if earlier. The defined benefit scheme provides a pension of up to two-thirds pensionable salary on retirement (subject to
Inland Revenue capping) dependent on length of service.
The transfer value for the UK Listing Authority disclosure has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice.
The pension scheme also provides dependant's pensions in the event of death, and lump sum benefits on death in service. 
As previously reported the existing defined benefit section of the company's UK Scheme closed to new entrants on 31 March 2004 and
closed to further accrual for all existing members from 31 March 2006.
Following the closure of the defined benefit scheme to further accrual and the implications of the changes in pensions legislation, Richard
Fulford-Smith and Martin Stopford chose not to join the defined contribution scheme and exercised their right to receive an allowance
equivalent to the company contribution of 15% net of National Insurance. Martin Stopford also exercised his right to transfer his benefits
from the Clarkson PLC Pension Scheme.
The pension figures shown in the table above also exclude any of the members' FURB entitlements (see over).  Directors' remuneration report continued
Defined contribution scheme
Jeff Woyda participated in a company defined contribution scheme during the year; the employer contribution was  37,500 being 15%
of base salary. 
FURB
The company also operated a funded unapproved retirement benefits scheme ( FURB') for Richard Fulford-Smith and Rob Ward who
joined the company after May 1989 and were therefore subject to Inland Revenue restrictions on their entitlement to benefit from the
group's defined benefit pension scheme. Following the Government's pension simplification proposals which were implemented on 
6 April 2006 ( A-Day') the company decided, on advice, to close the FURB. During the year, the company made no contributions 
into the FURB for Richard Fulford-Smith (2006: none). The FURB is being wound up.
There are no outstanding liabilities in respect of benefits due to current and past directors.
Approval by shareholders
At the annual general meeting of the company to be held on 7 May 2008 a resolution approving this report is to be proposed 
as an ordinary resolution.
This report was approved by the Board on 27 March 2008 and signed on its behalf by:
