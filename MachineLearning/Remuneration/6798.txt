The Remuneration Committee, which comprises Michael Nott and Sandy
Archibald, fixes the remuneration of the executive and non-executive
directors.
Service Contracts
The two executive directors are engaged under service contracts, and the
non-executive director under a letter of appointment. The service contract
for Nigel Duxbury was effective from the date of admission of the ordinary
shares to trading on AIM for an initial term of twelve months and
thereafter terminable by either party on six months' notice. The service
contract for Michael Nott was effective from 1 September 2006
terminable on three months' notice during the initial period of three

Share Options

senior executives strengthens the links between their personal interests
and those of investors and the Board intends to consider the adoption of
a share option scheme in due course.

Company are set out in the Directors' Report on page 9.
