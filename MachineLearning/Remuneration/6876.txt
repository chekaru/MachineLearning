This Report sets out the policy and disclosures in relation to
Directors' remuneration.At the Annual General Meeting of the
Company to be held on 25 September 2003, this Report will be
submitted to shareholders for their approval.This Report has been
produced in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002.
Composition and terms of reference of
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee ) is responsible for
determining the remuneration and the terms and conditions of
service of the Executive Directors.The Committee is chaired by Mr
D J Brecher and its other members are Sir William F Cotton and Mr
P E Selway-Swift, all of whom are Non-Executive Directors.The
Chairman also attends the meetings of the Committee, except when
his own remuneration is being considered.
Details of the Directors retiring by rotation at the Annual General
Meeting to be held on 25 September 2003 are given in the
Directors' Report, none of whom are members of the Committee.
In 2002, the Board accepted all the recommendations of the
Committee without amendment.
Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is reviewed by the
Chairman who makes recommendations to the Board.The Board
determines the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors within
the limits set out in the Articles of Association.The responsibilities of
the role and the level of fees paid in UK organisations of a similar size
and complexity to the Group are considered in setting remuneration
policy for Non-Executive Directors.
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors
In determining the remuneration policy for Executive Directors,
the Committee has considered a number of factors including:
  the importance of attracting, retaining and motivating
management of the appropriate calibre to further the success
of the business;
  the linking of reward to both individual and business
performance; and 
  ensuring that the interests of the Directors are aligned with
those of the shareholders.
To this end, the Committee seeks to approve a package for
Executive Directors consisting of basic salary, benefits, share
options and incentives, occasional bonuses and pensions.
The Committee has not sought advice from independent
consultants in determining the remuneration policy for the
Executive Directors, but intends appointing advisers.
The Committee believes that the policy adopted in the Group's
remuneration of Executive Directors and senior managers has
contributed to the sustained financial success and long term growth
of the Company.This policy has enabled the Company both to attract
and keep a high calibre management team - essential for a well run
and growing business.The strong shareholder returns achieved by the
Company are a testament to this policy.This policy will continue to
be reviewed in the light of changes in market practice and legislation,
which impact upon the Company.
The current elements of the remuneration packages can be
summarised as follows:
Base salary and benefits  Base salaries for Executive
Directors are reviewed by the Committee, normally annually,
having regard to competitive market practice and individual
performance for the financial year.
The general benefits provided to the Executive Directors are 
a fully-expensed car (or cash alternative), pension, and life and
health insurance.
Annual performance-related bonus As all Executive
Directors participate in the Alba plc Long-Term Incentive Plan, they
are currently not entitled to receive bonuses.
Share option schemes  Tax approved and unapproved
Executive Share Option Schemes (ESOS) are available to Executive
Directors and senior managers. However, as all Executive Directors
participate in the Alba plc Long-Term Incentive Plan, they are
currently not entitled to further grants of options under these
schemes.
Options granted to Executive Directors prior to 1996 under the
terms of the Alba plc Executive Share Option Scheme are not
normally exercisable until the third anniversary of the date of grant
but are not subject to any performance criteria which was normal
for options issued up to that time. Options granted to Executive
Directors from 1996 under the terms of the Alba plc Executive
Share Option Scheme and the Alba plc 1996 Executive Share
Option Scheme are not normally exercisable until the third
anniversary of the date of grant and are subject to performance
conditions set out in the rules of the relevant scheme. These
conditions were based on standard practice prevailing at the time
the scheme was established.
Executive Directors are also entitled to participate in the UK
Inland Revenue approved Savings-Related (SAYE) Share Option
Scheme which is available to all UK employees.The scheme is
subject to a cumulative maximum investment of  250 per month
for each individual.The share option runs for three, five or seven
years.At the end of the chosen period, the shares may be
purchased by the employee at a 20 per cent discount to the share
price at the invitation date.

2003 held 222,815 Ordinary Shares in the Company for
beneficiaries who include, inter alia, Directors and employees of
the Company and its subsidiaries.The Executive Directors, being
members of a class of potential beneficiaries of the ESOP, are, to
that extent, interested in all the Company's shares acquired by the
ESOP and not allocated.
During the year Mr A D Rose exercised options over 4,710
Ordinary Shares at a price of 202p per share.The market price of
the Company's shares at the date of exercise was 402.5p.

Messrs D B Harris and A D Rose disposed of 28,209 and 10,821
shares respectively on the date of release at a price of 320p per
Ordinary Share.
The release of shares no earlier than (b) 1 July 2003, (c) 1 July
2004 and (d) 1 July 2005, is conditional and will be allocated in
equal portions to the achievement of two performance targets
during the performance period namely:-
(i) a target (the TSR target) under which the increase in the Alba
plc Total Shareholder Return (TSR ) (namely share price
appreciation plus dividends) through the performance period
must exceed the average TSR, during the same period of the
applicable sub-section of the FTSE Actuaries Industry Sector by
9% or more (in which event 50% of the shares conditionally
awarded to the grantee will be released to him); and/or
remuneration report 16
applicable sub-section of the FTSE Actuaries Industry Sector by
9% or more (in which event 50% of the shares conditionally
awarded to the grantee will be released to him); and/or
(ii) a target (the EPS target) under which the average percentage
increase in Alba plc's normalised Earnings Per Share during its
three financial years commencing on 1 April immediately
preceding the award date must exceed the average percentage
increase in the Retail Prices Index during the same period by
3% per annum or more (in which event 50% of the shares
conditionally awarded will be released).
If in relation to either of the above targets Alba plc's growth
achievement against the relevant comparative during the
performance period is (in case of the TSR target) 6% or more but
less than 9% or (in case of the EPS target) 2% per annum or more
but less than 3% per annum, then the percentage of the shares
released to the grantee will be proportionately reduced from a
level of 50% of the award if the growth achieved is at the higher
percentage to a level of 25% of the award if the growth
achievement is at the lower percentage. If the growth achievement
is less than the lower percentage, no shares will be released to the
grantee.These targets were discussed with and approved by major
institutional shareholders prior to implementation of the Plan.
Following the passing of a resolution at the 2000 Annual General
Meeting, the Trustees of the Alba plc ESOP Trust and the Board
approved an amendment to the Rules of the Alba plc Long-Term
Incentive Plan so that, unless and until the Remuneration
Committee otherwise determines, the results of Bush Internet
Limited will not be taken into account for the purposes of
determining the Company's normalised Earnings Per Share.
The EPS target as set out in section (ii) above has been achieved 
in respect of the shares granted on 1 July 2000 and, therefore, at
least 50% of the shares conditionally awarded will be released
as soon as practicable after the end of the performance period.
Pensions
Mr D B Harris and Mr A D Rose are members of the Alba plc
Group Retirement and Death Benefit Scheme.This is a contracted-
in money purchase (defined contribution) scheme with no
underlying benefit guarantees. In addition, Mr D B Harris has a non-
contributory Executive Pension Scheme. Mr P J Cannon has a
Personal Pension Scheme into which the Company contributes.The
Company contributions into these schemes, which are based on a
percentage of pensionable salary, are set out in the table under
Directors' detailed emoluments.
Service contracts
Each of the Executive Directors is employed on a rolling contract
subject to one year's notice on either side except in the case of
Mr A Coda whose employment agreement is subject to six
months' notice on either side.
Details of employing company and dates of contract are as follows:
Director Date of Contract Employing Company
Mr J E Harris 4 September 1987 Alba plc
Mr D B Harris 4 September 1987 Alba plc
Mr A D Rose 4 September 1987 Alba plc
Mr P J Cannon 4 September 1987 Harvard Maritime Limited
Mr A Coda 13 March 1997 Roadstar Management SA
The Committee believes that, in order to attract Executive
Directors of the right calibre and to compete for talent with our
competitors, it is necessary to offer service contracts with notice
periods of one year. Under the terms of the Executive Directors'
service contracts, on termination by the employing company,
except in the case of dismissal for cause, the employing company
shall make a payment to the Executive Director equal to:
a)  the Executive's basic salary for the period of notice, and
b)  the cost of provision of pension and benefits for the 
notice period.
Such payment will be reduced proportionately in the event that the
Executive Director works part of his period of notice.
Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts.Their re-
appointment is considered every three years by the Board and, if the
Board recommends such re-appointment, by the Company.The date
when each Director was appointed is shown in the Directors'
biographies on page 18.There are no compensation provisions for
early termination of Non-Executive Director appointments.
