POLICY ON EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION (CONTINUED) 
Benefits in kind 
In addition, executives are provided with the use of a company car and personal medical cover, together with other 
smaller benefits in line with normal company practice.  Benefits in kind are not pensionable. 
Pension 
Of the executive directors at 30 September 2004, C J Wood and A Sharp were members of the Albion Limited 
Pension Scheme.  The Scheme is a contributory, Inland Revenue approved, final salary scheme.  The Pension plan 
provided for C J Wood is two thirds of pensionable salary at age 60 and the pension for A Sharp is on the basis of 
1/60 of final salary for every year of service. 
T C Rogers, who was appointed to the board on 1 October 2001, participates in the company defined contribution 
scheme. 
Directors' share options 
None of the directors held share options in the company at 30 September 2004 (2003: nil). 
Service agreements 
Currently the managing director has a three year rolling service contract with the Company.  The remuneration 
committee consider that it is inappropriate to seek to negotiate the contract length as this would involve making 
payments to alter the contract terms.  The finance director and operations director have one year rolling service 
contracts.  All such contracts terminate when the director in question reaches age 60.  The start dates of the directors 
service contracts are Mr C J Wood 29 February 1996, Mr T C Rogers 14 January 2002 and Mrs A Sharp 14 March 
2003.  The length of service contracts continues to be reviewed by the remuneration committee.  The remuneration 
committee, where it considers it to be appropriate, applies the principle of mitigation to any compensation payable 
on the termination of service contracts.  Contractual termination payments are equal to notice periods on contracts. 
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board within the limits set out in the 
Articles of Association.  Non-executive directors do not have a contract of service and are not eligible to join the 
company's pension scheme.

Albion Share Price
 
The above graph shows Albion PLC's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance compared to the TSR of the 
FTSE Fledgling ex investment trusts index over the past five years.  TSR is defined as the percentage change over 
the period in market price of shares assuming the reinvestment of income and funding of liabilities of the theoretical 
holding. 
The company is a member of the FTSE Fledgling excluding investment trusts index and as such, this sector is 
considered to be the most appropriate comparator group upon which a broad equity market index is calculated.  TSR 
has been calculated on a one month averaging basis in order to reduce the volatility associated with spot prices.

PENSIONS (CONTINUED) 
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance 
Note GN11.  The transfer value of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme 
would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the scheme's liability in respect of the 
directors' pension benefits.  They do not represent sums payable to individual directors and therefore cannot be 
added meaningfully to annual remuneration. 
 
The increase in the transfer value less directors' contributions is the increase in the transfer value of the accrued 
benefits during the year after deducting the director's personal contributions to the scheme. 
 
The accrued entitlements for Mr C J Wood and Ms A Sharp are based on final pensionable salaries of  95,333 
and  60,974, respectively, as advised by the scheme's administrators. 
 
The transfer value of the increase in accrued benefits, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value 
of the increase in accrued benefits that the Directors has earned in the period, whereas the change in his/her 
transfer value, required by the Companies Act discloses the absolute increase or decrease in his/her transfer 
value and includes the change in value of the accrued benefits that results from market volatility affecting the 
transfer value at the beginning of the period, as well as the additional value earned in the year. 
 
In addition  10,000 (2003:  10,000) was paid by the company in relation to contributions to the defined 
contributions scheme on behalf of Mr T C Rogers. 
 
In relation to the former directors and a former directors spouse, unfunded pension amounting to  29,036 
(2003:  46,882) were paid during the year.
