DEAR SHAREHOLDER
INTRODUCTION
I am writing to you as the first Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee of Alent 
plc (Alent ), which began trading on the 
London Stock Exchange on 19 December 
2012. 
As outlined earlier in this Annual Report, 
Alent was formed following the demerger 
of Cookson Group plc (Cookson ). Alent' s 
shares were admitted to the premium listing 
segment of the Official List and to trading on 
the London Stock Exchange' s main market 
for listed securities on 19 December 2012. 
Consequently, Alent is now a separately 
listed leading global supplier of advanced 
surface treatment, plating chemicals and 
electronics assembly materials. 
This report covers:
 the remit and composition of the 
Remuneration Committee;
 details of payments and outstanding 
awards/entitlements that were made to 
Executive Directors during 2012 under 
the Cookson Executive Director 
remuneration arrangements; and
 details of the current and forward 
looking Alent remuneration policy and 
its proposed implementation, together 
with the Executive Director 
remuneration arrangements and policy 
for 2013.
Due to Alent being separately listed 
only for the last 13 days of 2012, from 
19 December to 31 December (being 
the period to which this report formally 
relates), we are required to disclose pay, 
annual incentive and other data only in 
respect of Alent, which is generally for the 
13 days only, and from 31 October 2012 in 
respect of the three new Non-executive 
Directors who were not on the Cookson 
board, with no historical comparisons. 
This report includes that data as we are 
required to do. Shareholders should 
also be mindful of the fact that Alent's 
Remuneration Committee held no formal 
meetings in 2012, and its first formal 
meeting was in January 2013.
In terms of the Company' s overall 
remuneration policy for 2013, the 
remuneration structure for Executive 
Directors and other senior managers aims to:
 be sufficiently competitive to attract 
and retain high calibre and experienced 
executives, while reflecting the 
international complexity of the 
Company's business and operations; 
 strongly support the Company's 
strategy and long-term corporate 
success, having due regard to 
environmental, social and governance 
issues within the Company's overall risk 
profile; 
 align management's interests with those 
of shareholders; and
 foster a high performance culture, with 
a substantial portion of remuneration 
being performance linked.
The Company aims to provide median total 
remuneration levels for target performance 
and up to upper quartile total remuneration 
levels for superior performance. This will 
be judged against FTSE 250 companies 
and relevant international sector-specific 
companies to reach a rounded judgement. 
The Alent Prospectus disclosed the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors 
of Alent at the time of the demerger, 
comprising base salary, annual incentive, 
intended participation in the new Alent 
Share Plan (a long-term incentive share plan 
for Executive Directors and other selected 
executives) and retirement and other 
benefits. The Demerger, on the terms set 
out in the Alent Prospectus which contained 
these details (a copy of which can be found 
on the Company' s website), together with 
the Alent Share Plan which was put as a 
separate resolution to be voted on, were 
both approved by Cookson shareholders. 
The Company is committed to open and 
transparent dialogue with its shareholders on 
remuneration as well as other governance 
matters. As a matter of course the 
Remuneration Committee will continue to 
consult with key institutional shareholders 
and various representative bodies about 
the pay and incentive arrangements of the 
Company' s Executive Directors. Indeed, 
during the Demerger process, the views of 
Cookson' s largest shareholders were sought 
on a number of matters, including in relation 
to the then proposed remuneration policy , 
structure and positioning of Alent, while 
earlier this year I met with a number of Alent' s 
shareholders to begin the dialogue process 
and answer shareholders' questions. The 
views of these shareholders were, on the 
whole, very supportive and we look forward 
to a continuing dialogue on both the new 
Alent business, and what we need to do in 
respect of overall remuneration practices for 
our Executive Directors and the Company as 
a whole. I hope you will be able to support 
the Committee' s report at this year' s Annual 
General Meeting. 
Yours sincerely, 
No l Harwerth
Chairman, Remuneration Committee

OUR GOVERNANCE
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The primary role and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are:
 setting the appropriate remuneration for the Chairman, the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary;
 recommending and monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for senior management, being the first layer of management 
below Board level; and
 overseeing the operation of any executive share incentive plans.
A copy of the Remuneration Committee's Terms of Reference is available on the Company's website www.alent.com
COMPOSITION OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The current members of the Remuneration Committee are Independent Non-executive Directors, namely Dr Emma Fitzgerald, 
Jan Oosterveld, Mark Williamson and No l Harwerth, who also chairs the Remuneration Committee. Each of the members of the 
Remuneration Committee was appointed as a Director of the Company on 31 October 2012 and is independent. The Company 
Secretary acts as Committee Secretary. The Chairman, Chief Executive and any other Directors are invited to attend Committee 
meetings as appropriate but do not participate in discussions of their own remuneration.
ADVICE PROVIDED TO THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
In formulating its policies and deciding individual remuneration levels, the Remuneration Committee is advised by the Chief Executive 
and the Company Secretary, by the external advisers Towers Watson (Towers ), and the law firm Clifford Chance LLP (CC ). Towers has 
been appointed directly by the Remuneration Committee to provide advice on executive remuneration matters, including remuneration 
structure and policy, updates on market practices and trends, and guidance on the implementation and operation of long-term 
incentive plans. Towers has also provided the Remuneration Committee with remuneration benchmarking data for certain executives. 
CC provides advice on the drafting and operation of the Alent Share Plan and other executive or employee share arrangements 
operated by the Company from time to time. Towers is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct in relation 
to Executive Remuneration Consulting in the UK. 
Aon Hewitt (the parent company of NewBridgeStreet (NBS), a firm of remuneration consultants) provides administration and actuarial 
services in relation to the Company's pension plans and NBS provides share award valuation advice to the Company. 
The Remuneration Committee does not believe that the provision of any of these services to the Company compromises the 
independence or integrity of the advice that it receives from Towers, Aon Hewitt and CC. 
ACTIVITIES OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Given that the Demerger did not become effective until 19 December 2012, the Remuneration Committee did not meet during the 
period under review. However, the Remuneration Committee expects to meet at least three times in 2013 to consider such matters as:
 salary review proposals for the Executive Directors and senior management;
 reviewing achievement against the performance targets, and approving payouts, in respect of the annual incentive arrangements;
 setting performance targets and approving the structure of the annual incentive arrangements; 
 considering the Company's performance against the performance conditions applicable to the Cookson awards rolled over into 
awards over Alent shares, and authorising the vesting of these awards where relevant;
 setting the performance conditions and authorising the grant of awards under the Alent Share Plan;
 receiving feedback on the Remuneration Committee Chairman's meetings with key institutional shareholders regarding the 
Company's remuneration policy and practice, and, in the light of this, advice received from the external advisers regarding trends in 
remuneration practice and governance, discussing the Company's approach to executive remuneration and reviewing whether any 
changes should be made; 
 reviewing the Remuneration Committee's Terms of Reference, and recommending any amendments to the Board for approval; and
 reviewing and approving the 2012 Directors' Remuneration Report.  OUR GOVERNANCE www.alent.com

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ANNUAL INCENTIVE AND LONG TERM INCENTIVE 2012 ENTITLEMENTS PURSUANT TO PRE-DEMERGER 
REMUNERATION ARRANGEMENTS OPERATED BY COOKSON
ANNUAL INCENTIVES (COOKSON)
For the financial year 2012, the Executive Directors' annual incentives were based on Cookson Group adjusted operating profit 
performance, with an adjustment based on Cookson's working capital performance to focus greater attention on cash flow performance. 
The effect of the latter was to reduce the level of any payout that the Executive Directors could achieve by up to 10% if specified 
working capital targets were not attained. The adjuster could increase the level of payout by up to 10%, but not above the usual plan 
maximum. Mr Butterworth's annual incentive was assessed solely against this criterion, whilst half of Mr Corbett's annual incentive was 
assessed against this criterion and the remainder was based upon the divisional trading profit of the then Performance Materials division 
adjusted for performance against a key operating cash flow target. Their maximum incentive potential was 100% of salary.
For 2012, the relevant performance resulted in the following annual incentive payments for Messrs Corbett (Chief Executive) and 
Butterworth (Interim Finance Director), who were both Directors during the period:
Name Measure Weighting
Target 
Performance*
Achieved
(% of salary)
Incentive

(% of salary)
Steve Corbett Group Adjusted earnings 50%  207.1m 0% 0%
Steve Corbett Performance Materials Trading Profit 50%  109.2m* 8.7% 8.7%
Mike Butterworth Group Adjusted earnings 100%  207.1m 0% 0%
* Adjusted earnings and profits
An Annual Incentive equivalent to 8.7% of base salary will therefore be paid to Mr Corbett in respect of 2012. This annual payment is 
reported in the Directors' remuneration table on page 67. Mr Butterworth was not eligible for an annual incentive. 
LONG TERM INCENTIVES (COOKSON) 
The demerger did not result in early vesting of awards held by Executive Directors under the Cookson Long Term Incentive Plan 
(Cookson LTIP). 
2010 Cookson LTIP Award
In the case of the awards made to Executive Directors in 2010 under the Cookson LTIP where the performance period was due to 
end on 31 December 2012, the period was shortened very slightly, to end immediately before the Demerger Effective Time, so that 
performance was measured purely in relation to Cookson's performance   being relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance 
and growth in headline EPS (50% each). These awards are due to vest on 7 April 2013 and were rolled over to become awards over a 
combination of Alent and Vesuvius plc shares in the same combination that applied to Cookson shareholders under the terms of the 
Demerger. This reflects the fact that these awards relate to historic Cookson performance and not to the future performance of Alent or 
Vesuvius.
The shortened performance period mentioned above for 2010 awards ended on 18 December 2012. Cookson's TSR performance during 
this three-year performance period was assessed against the comparator group (FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts) and it was 
determined that Cookson's performance was between the median and the upper quintile, a level which would result in a 17.7% out of a 
maximum 50% vesting. In addition, Cookson's annual compound headline EPS growth was assessed for the period as being over 10% 
above RPI, a level which would result in 50% out of a maximum 50% vesting. Prior to the vesting of any award, as an additional hurdle, 
vesting must be justified by the underlying financial performance of Cookson over the performance period. It has been concluded that 
the vesting of the 2010 Cookson LTIP awards is justified by the underlying financial performance of Cookson. Accordingly, 67.7% of the 
Cookson 2010 LTIP awards will vest on 7 April 2013.
2011 and 2012 Cookson LTIP Awards
In the case of the grants made to Executive Directors in 2011 and 2012 under the Cookson LTIP , these awards over Cookson shares were 
rolled over to become awards over Alent shares of equivalent value. Performance will still be measured over a three-year period, but by 
reference to Cookson performance up to the Demerger Effective Time and by reference to Alent performance thereafter to the end of 
the period. The awards continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the existing Cookson LTIP , save that the relevant company 
(and relevant remuneration committee) is Alent instead of Cookson.
Remuneration Report continued Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012

STOCK CODE: ALNT
OUR GOVERNANCE
The vesting of the awards, when originally granted, was based on Cookson's performance against specified performance conditions 
measured over a three-year period. Vesting of 50% of shares awarded was based upon Cookson's three-year TSR performance relative 
to that of the constituent companies of the FTSE 250, excluding Investment Trusts, and 50% on EPS growth over the three-year period. 
The two measures operated independently. 
The new Alent targets for measuring performance for the 2011 and 2012 Cookson LTIP awards, following the Demerger, is now as follows:
As regards the EPS target, the currently disclosed Cookson headline EPS threshold and maximum vesting targets for the final year of 
the relevant three-year performance period have been split between Alent and Vesuvius by reference to their respective trading profit 
contributions to Cookson's total 2012 trading profit such that the new Alent and Vesuvius targets aggregate to the currently disclosed 
Cookson targets. The respective Alent adjusted EPS values as reported for the final year of the three-year performance period will then be 
compared with these new threshold and maximum targets to determine the vesting outcome. 
Vesting of 50% of Perfomance and Matching Share Awards under the 2011 LTIP awards is based on adjusted EPS growth in accordance with 
the following schedule:
Adjusted EPS for 2013 financial year
Performance Shares 
Vesting Percentage
Matching Shares Vesting Ratio 
(Matching Shares: Investment Shares)
Less than 33.4 pence 0% 0
33.4 pence 12.5% 0.25 : 1
40.1 pence 50% 1.125 : 1
Between 33.4 pence and 40.1 pence Pro rata between 12.5% and 50%
Pro rata between 0.25 : 1 and 1.125 : 1
Vesting of 50% of Perfomance and Matching Share Awards under the 2012 LTIP awards is based on adjusted EPS growth in accordance with 
the following schedule:
Adjusted EPS for 2014 financial year
Performance Shares 
Vesting Percentage
Matching Shares Vesting Ratio 
(Matching Shares: Investment Shares)
Less than 34.6 pence 0% 0
34.6 pence 12.5% 0.25 : 1
42.7 pence 50% 1.125 : 1
Between 34.6 pence and 42.7 pence Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25 : 1 and 1.125 : 1
As regards the TSR target, Cookson's TSR growth from the start of the relevant three-year performance period up to the time of the 
Demerger will be determined and added to the TSR growth of Alent from the Demerger date to the end of the three-year performance 
period. This aggregate TSR growth will then be ranked against the TSR of the relevant comparator group and the resulting vesting 
outcome will be calculated against the TSR performance schedule in the Cookson LTIP .
Cookson Deferred Bonus Share Plan (Cookson DBSP)
No Executive Directors of Alent hold any Cookson DBSP awards. 
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS FOR 2013 
The remuneration policy of the Company aims to establish a remuneration structure for Executive Directors and other senior managers which:
 is sufficiently competitive to attract and retain high calibre and experienced executives, while reflecting the international complexity 
of the Company's business and operations; 
 strongly supports the Company's strategy and long-term corporate success, having due regard to environmental, social and 
governance issues within the Company's overall risk profile; 
 aligns management's interests with those of shareholders; and
 fosters a high performance culture, with a substantial portion of remuneration being performance linked.
In formulating remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee has regard to the international scale and nature of the Company's 
operations and takes into consideration the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code and guidelines issued by its leading 
shareholders and bodies such as the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds. The Remuneration  OUR GOVERNANCE www.alent.com

Committee takes into account the pay and employment conditions of other Company employees when determining Executive 
Directors' remuneration, particularly when determining base salary increases. 
Given that the Executive Directors' current remuneration arrangements were agreed on a confidential basis before the Demerger was 
announced, so as to be disclosed in the Alent Prospectus, it was not possible to carry out an internal employee consultation. In the case 
of Mr Corbett, this was a promotion and in the case of Mr Egan, this was a new hire   with the result that external comparisons and 
benchmarks were used. It was not a case of comparing the new salaries with any more broadly based salary increases given across the 
Company. However, this data, and these comparative measures, will be included in next year's Remuneration Report.
The base salaries and the overall incentives and remuneration structure for the Executive Directors at the time of the Demerger were 
described in the Alent Prospectus.
The Remuneration Committee also obtains information on the remuneration paid for comparable roles at other companies, in order to 
provide a point of reference for determining remuneration policy. 
The Remuneration Committee is aware of the need to ensure that the remuneration policy is firmly linked to the Company' s strategy , including its 
risk management philosophy . As all Remuneration Committee members also serve on the Audit Committee, each Committee benefits from the 
Directors' experience on the other . This is particularly relevant when the Remuneration Committee is considering matters such as the Company' s 
achievement of performance conditions and the implications for the Company' s risk profile of the award of incentives under the Company' s 
remuneration programmes. The Remuneration Committee considers the Company' s executive remuneration policy and incentive structure to be 
compatible with the Company' s risk management and internal control systems.
The Board' s intention is that remuneration is linked to strategic objectives and the delivery of superior performance, over both the medium 
and longer term. In addition to base salary , pensions and other benefits, the two key incentives for executives are the annual incentive plan 
and the long-term plans. The Board' s objective is to provide long-term value creation for shareholders, both absolute and relative, while also 
delivering sustainable short and longer term profits, earnings and cash flow performance. The Company' s strategy to achieve these objectives is 
to focus on high growth end-markets, with a continuing pipeline of innovative and superior new products driven by an exceptionally strong R&D 
capability , backed by a clear focus on servicing customers through a value-adding OEM sales strategy , an efficient global footprint and continuous 
improvement programmes in its manufacturing and other processes. In addition, the Committee, in supervising the incentive schemes, is mindful 
to ensure that these do not encourage an inappropriate level of risk taking. 
The remuneration policy is designed to incentivise and reward executives to deliver their contribution to the achievement of the Company' s 
strategy , with a significant proportion of the Executive Directors' total remuneration being based on the variable, performance-related elements 
of the annual incentive and the Alent Share Plan. The performance conditions under these arrangements are designed to support the Company' s 
strategic objectives, including a focus on growth and shareholder returns by targeting key business imperatives. For 2013 these are relative total 
shareholder return (TSR), defined as the increase in the value of a share, including reinvested dividends, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS). 
T argets are objective, auditable and transparent and as such are considered to be appropriate performance measures for management. T o 
ensure that their interests are aligned with those of shareholders, Executive Directors are required to build a significant stake in the Company in 
accordance with the Company' s share retention guidelines. 
The Remuneration Committee will evaluate the efficacy of the Company's executive remuneration policy each year and commission 
formal reviews as it considers appropriate.

FURTHER DETAILS OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR 2013 
BASE SALARY 
Base salary levels reflect the individual's contribution and experience, the Company's financial performance, and the salaries paid 
in comparator companies. At the time of the Demerger, Mr Corbett's promotion was reflected in a salary increase of 20% due to his 
promotion to Chief Executive of the Company, his resultant changing role, and his increased responsibilities. Mr Corbett's salary is 
$750,000. Mr Egan's base salary is  310,000.
ANNUAL INCENTIVE 
The Executive Directors are eligible to receive an annual incentive calculated as a percentage of base salary and based on achievement 
of specified targets determined following consideration of the Company's financial budget and prior year actual financial results. The 
targets will be set to ensure that maximum bonuses are only paid for significantly exceeding expectations. There is no deferral of annual 
bonuses for Executive Directors.
Each year the Remuneration Committee will establish the financial performance criteria for the forthcoming year. These criteria will be 
set by reference to the Company's financial budget and prior year actual financial results. The target range will be set to ensure that 
maximum bonuses are only paid for significantly exceeding market expectations. The Remuneration Committee considers that the 
setting and attainment of these targets is important in the context of achievement of the Company's longer-term strategic goals.
The annual incentive has a threshold level of performance below which no award is paid, a target level at which Executive Directors 
are entitled to a payment equal to 50% of their respective base salary and a maximum performance level at which a maximum award 
is earned. Mr Corbett's maximum annual incentive potential is 125% of base salary and his target annual incentive potential is 62.5% of 
base salary. For Mr Egan, his maximum annual incentive potential is 100% of base salary and his target annual incentive potential is 50% 
of base salary.
The structure of the 2013 Annual Incentive plan for Messrs Corbett and Egan will be based primarily on the achievement of adjusted 
earnings per share targets for 2013, together with a deflator if working capital targets are not met.
ALENT LONG-TERM INCENTIVES 
Summary
The long-term incentives are awarded under the Alent Share Plan (the Plan ), which was approved by Cookson shareholders at the 
time of the Demerger and rewards executives for delivering superior TSR, defined as the increase in the value of a share, including 
reinvested dividends, and EPS growth over a set period of time, and as such is intended to align executive remuneration with 
shareholders' interests. The Plan is structured as an umbrella plan , which gives greater flexibility in terms of the awards which can be 
made, in line with current market practice. This means that the Company only needs to have one set of share plan rules to cover all its 
current and prospective discretionary share plan needs.
The Plan will permit awards to be granted as:
 performance share awards (LTI );
 deferred share bonus awards;
 restricted share awards; and
 market-price options. OUR GOVERNANCE www.alent.com
64
Eligibility and individual grant levels
For Executive Directors, awards granted within 12 months following the Demerger will be granted in the form of performance share 
awards. It is not intended to grant deferred share bonus awards or restricted share awards to Executive Directors, although David 
Egan will be awarded a one-off grant of restricted shares under the plan, to compensate him for the awards which he forfeited on 
leaving his previous employer. This award was calculated on 50% of his base salary, less the amount of his 2012 annual incentive award 
from his previous employer, referenced to the Alent share price on his date of joining. The resultant award is 23,909 Alent shares, 
with 50% vesting on 1 January 2014 and the remaining 50% vesting on 1 January 2015. The award will be issued immediately after the 
announcement of the annual results and subject to the rules of the Alent Share Plan (the Alent Plan ), provided he had not given or 
received notice on each vesting date. 
For the 12 month period after the Demerger, the Remuneration Committee shall have the discretion to consider the grant of 
different types of award including the utilisation of market price options, in which case any performance share awards will be reduced 
accordingly. 
Executive Directors are eligible to receive, on an annual basis:
 a performance share award with a face value of up to 200% of base salary; or
 a market-price option with a face value of up to 300% of base salary.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to grant a mix of performance share awards and market-price options provided the 
commercial value of the mixed grants is not higher than the commercial value of an unmixed grant that would otherwise have been 
provided to the executive.
Performance conditions for performance share awards
The vesting of performance share awards granted by the Company will be based on the Company's performance against specified 
performance conditions measured over a three-year period. 
For performance share awards granted in 2013, the proportion of shares vesting will be based on the Company's performance against 
specified performance conditions. Vesting of 50% of shares awarded will be based upon the Company's three-year TSR performance 
relative to that of the constituent companies, the FTSE 250 excluding Investment Trusts (or a bespoke group of at least 20 comparator 
companies as determined by the Remuneration Committee) and 50% will be based on growth in adjusted EPS over a three-year period. 
The two measures will operate independently.
The details regarding the performance conditions for performance share awards to be granted in 2013 (threshold and maximum targets 
to determine the vesting outcome etc.) have not yet been finally determined. However, the proposed concepts and structure have been 
discussed with key institutional shareholders and their comments noted.
The Remuneration Committee will obtain independent external advice to assess whether the Company has met the TSR performance 
condition at the end of the relevant performance period and to confirm that the companies which make up the index and the 
measurement of the Company's performance are both in accordance with the rules of the Plan. Measurement of the Company's TSR 
takes place over a performance period commencing on the first day of the Company's financial year in which the award is granted. TSR 
is measured as the percentage increase in a return index for the Company and each comparator company between the beginning and 
end of the performance period. The return index at the beginning of the performance period is the average of the return index on each 
weekday in the three-month period prior to the start of the performance period. The same three-month averaging method is used to 
ascertain the return index at the end of the performance period. The companies are then ranked, in descending order, according to 
their TSR. If the Company is ranked at or above the median of the comparator group then a proportion of the awards is eligible to vest. 
Adjusted EPS will be calculated on a consistent basis. Growth in adjusted EPS is the annualised percentage growth over the 
performance period. Adjusted EPS for the base year (i.e. the calendar year prior to the award date) is compared with the final year (i.e. 
the calendar year three years after the base year). 
CLAWBACK ARRANGEMENTS 
The Executive Directors are subject to clawback arrangements. In the event that a misstatement is identified in the Company's 
consolidated financial statements which requires the restatement of a prior year's accounts in order to ensure compliance with the 
requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards or any applicable law, then such portion as the Remuneration Committee

OUR GOVERNANCE
deems appropriate of any variable executive remuneration (including from both the annual incentive and the Plan and on an after tax 
basis) resulting from a measure of financial performance affected by the misstatement will be subject to clawback provisions.
SHARE USAGE
Under the rules of the Plan the Company has the discretion to satisfy awards either by the transfer of existing shares or by the allotment 
of newly issued shares. The decision on how to satisfy awards is taken by the Board, which considers the most prudent and appropriate 
sourcing arrangement for the Company. 
The Alent Share Plan complies with the current ABI guidelines on headroom which provide that overall dilution under all plans should 
not exceed 10% over a ten-year period in relation to the Company's issued share capital, with a further limitation of 5% in any ten-year 
period on discretionary schemes. 
Details of the awards granted to Executive Directors and outstanding under the Cookson LTIP as at 31 December 2012 are given in note 
28 to the consolidated financial statements and note 10 to the Company financial statements. No awards exist under the Alent Share 
Plan as at 31 December 2012.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (TSR) GRAPH
Given that the Demerger did not become effective until 19 December 2012, it is not possible to produce a graph which compares 
the Company's TSR over the last five years with the return on an appropriate index (in compliance with the Large & Medium sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts & Report) Regulations 2008). For completeness, and in accordance with the Regulations, the graph 
below does compare the Company's TSR over the short period from the Demerger to 31 December 2012 with the return on the FTSE 
250 index (excluding Investment Trusts). This index has been chosen as the comparator index to reflect the size, international scope and 
diversity of the Company.
