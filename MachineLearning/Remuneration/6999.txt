REMUNERATION 
REPORT
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committee's 
report on Directors' remuneration for 2013. In this Annual 
Statement, which precedes our Policy Report and Annual 
Report on Remuneration, I have set out the context for the 
remuneration decisions, and the outcome of our review of 
remuneration which was completed in 2013. 
Remuneration decisions
The key decisions on Executive Director Remuneration 
proposed in 2013 related to salary increases for 2014 and 
payments of variable remuneration. With regard to the 
former, the Committee decided to increase salaries for the 
Executive Directors by 2.5% which was in line with the 2.5% 
increase to base salary for the general workforce. As for 
variable remuneration, no payments are to be made to 
Executive Directors based on performance in 2013. This is 
largely a result of overall trading for 2013 being slightly below 
our expectations due to the softer than anticipated demand 
in consumer electronics end-markets which resulted in Alent 
failing to hit its budgeted profit targets.
The Committee also approved awards to be made to the 
Executive Directors under the Alent Share Plan. These awards 
will vest in 2016 subject to the satisfaction of EPS growth 
targets and a relative TSR performance condition.
Alent's incentive arrangements were established prior to  
the demerger of Alent from Cookson Group plc and were 
not designed specifically for Alent. As a result, in the 2012 
Alent report on remuneration, the Committee highlighted  
its intent to review executive remuneration including  
annual and long-term incentive compensation to ensure 
that remuneration is appropriately aligned with Alent 
shareholders, market practice and Alent strategy. This review 
is now complete, and the key findings under the Proposed 
Changes for 2014  section of the Directors' Remuneration 
Report (DRR) relating to the annual bonus plan are noted  
as follows.
Summary of 2013 annual bonus arrangements
The 2013 annual bonus outcome is determined by 
performance against an annual EPS target. This outcome is 
then modified up or down by up to 10% based on working 
capital performance. There is no deferral of bonus 
payments into shares. The bonus outcomes for the 
achievement of Threshold, Target and Maximum 
performance targets for 2013 are set out below:

Threshold 0% 0%
Target 62.5% 50%
Maximum 125% 100%
1.  Note that bonus payouts between different performance levels 
are determined on a linear basis
The review identified that the 2013 and prior annual bonus 
performance ranges between threshold and maximum 
had been too narrow which resulted in all or nothing  
bonus outcomes and a perception that the bonus  
failed to reward years of particularly strong performance.  
With regard to performance measures, the review 
highlighted the opportunity to increase both the 
motivational effect of the annual bonus and the alignment 
of the plan with corporate strategy by including other 
performance measures which could drive the delivery  
of Alent strategy.
Proposed changes for 2014
The Committee is proposing the following changes for 2014 
in order to incentivise and reward strong performance, 
align the annual incentive closer to Alent strategy, and 
increase shareholder alignment. 
Change 1: Introduce a superior  performance target 
and increase bonus maximum
Increasing the top end of the performance range with  
the introduction of superior performance targets and 
increasing the maximum bonus opportunity will make the 
annual bonus outcomes less all or nothing  whilst ensuring 
that the additional bonus opportunity is only payable for 
the achievement of challenging targets. For both the Chief 
Executive and Finance Director it is proposed to increase 
the maximum bonus opportunity to 150% and 125% of base 
salary respectively.
Change 2: Introduce deferral into Alent shares, to be 
held for three years, of half of any bonus above target 
opportunity (see table below for detail)
Introducing bonus deferral will increase the alignment of 
executive and shareholder interests, increase the retention 
value and period of the annual bonus, and ensure that the 
payment of any extra bonus opportunity is only for the 
delivery of sustained long-term performance. Awards of 
Alent shares will be made under the existing Share Plan.
Change 3: Modest increase to target bonus (see table 
below for detail)
Modest increases to target bonus opportunities will help 
address the below market positioning of target bonus and 
also help address the reduction in cash compensation 
resulting from the introduction of deferral. 
Change 4: Introduction of additional performance 
measures to the annual bonus
To help drive Alent strategy, it is proposed to incorporate 
additional performance measures in the annual bonus.  
It is intended that the relative weightings of these measures 
could be changed from year to year to reflect changes in 
Alent strategy. The proposed measures and weightings for 
2014 are set out below and reflect the continued focus on 
EPS and return on NSV margin:
  Adjusted EPS targets (50% of opportunity)
  Return on NSV Margin (30%)
  Personal/Strategic Objectives (20%) 68   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

Conclusion
We propose to introduce these changes for the 2014 
financial year. The other elements of Executive Director 
Remuneration, including the Alent Share Plan, are 
expected to remain broadly unchanged from current 
practice. We believe our proposals are balanced and fair, 
will help to incentivise the delivery of Alent strategy and 
support success for Alent and its shareholders.
Futhermore, the Company is committed to open and 
transparent dialogue with its shareholders on remuneration 
as well as other governance matters. As a matter of course 
the Remuneration Committee will continue to consult with 
key institutional shareholders and various representative 
bodies about the pay and incentive arrangements of the 
Company's Executive Directors. We look forward to a 
continuing dialogue on both the Alent business, and what 
we need to do in respect of overall remuneration practices 
for our Executive Directors and the Company as a whole.
I hope you have found this Annual Statement helpful, and 
will be able to support the Remuneration Policy Report  
and Annual Report on Remuneration at this year's Annual 
General Meeting.
Yours sincerely,
NO L HARWERTH

DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION POLICY
The following Remuneration Policy Report summarises the Remuneration Committee's policy for the remuneration of 
Executive Directors which will operate from 1 January 2014 and, if approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting, will become formally effective at the 2014 AGM.
Executive Directors' Remuneration Policy Table
All the elements of Executive Directors' remuneration (both fixed and variable) which comprises of base salary, annual 
bonus, deferred awards, long-term share incentives and retirement benefits (pension) are outlined in the following table:
Element of 
Remuneration Link to Strategy Operation Opportunity Performance Metrics
Base salary Helps to recruit and  
retain. Reflects the 
individual's experience, 
role and contribution 
within the Company.
Paid in cash.
Normally reviewed  
by the Remuneration 
Committee annually  
and any increases  
effective from 1 January. 
No prescribed maximum 
annual increase.
However, merit increases 
align to group increases 
and those for the  
wider workforce  
except in exceptional 
circumstances.
n/a
Benefits Helps to recruit  
and retain.
Executive Directors  
are eligible to receive 
certain benefits in kind.
These principally  
comprise company  
car allowances, life 
assurance and  
medical insurance.
Provision of relocation 
assistance upon 
appointment if/when 
applicable.
n/a
Annual Incentive Incentivises Executive 
Directors to achieve 
specific, pre-defined 
annual targets.
Half of any bonus  
above target is deferred  
in shares for three years. 
The remainder is paid  
in cash.
Subject to clawback.
150% of base salary  
(70% at Target) for the  
Chief Executive.
125% of base salary  
(55% at Target) for the 
Finance Director.
At least 70% of the award  
is based on financial 
measures such as EPS.
The remainder is based  
on personal / strategic 
measures of performance.
For each individual bonus 
element, achievement of 
the threshold performance 
target delivers no payment 
for that element.
Alent Share Plan Flexible umbrella plan  
designed to align 
Executive Directors' 
interests with those of 
shareholders and  
aid retention of Executive 
Directors over a three-year 
performance period.
Awards are generally 
made annually.
Awards can be made  
as performance shares, 
market-priced options,  
or a combination of both.
Awards vest at least three 
years after their award 
date subject to the 
achievement of specified 
performance conditions.
For performance shares, 
the Remuneration 
Committee has the 
discretion to award 
participants cash or 
additional shares equal  
in value to the dividends 
accrued on any shares 
that vest.
Subject to clawback.
Maximum face value of  
an award is: 
-  200% of base salary for 
performance shares; or
-  300% of base salary for 
market-priced options.
If a combination of 
performance shares  
and market-price options  
is awarded then the 
commercial value of the 
mixed grant cannot be 
higher than the 
commercial value  
that could have been 
awarded under a  
single grant.
Vesting of awards is  
based on: 
(i)  the Company's TSR 
performance versus a 
peer group selected by 
the Committee.
(ii)  internal financial 
measures as selected  
by the Committee, such 
as EPS.
At least 50% of any award 
will always be based on 
internal financial measures.
Prior to any vesting the 
Remuneration Committee 
has also stipulated that,  
as an additional hurdle, it 
needs to be satisfied that 
vesting has been justified  
by the underlying financial 
performance of the 
Company over the 
performance period.
Retirement Benefits Helps to recruit and retain 
key employees.
Ensures income 
in retirement.
Retirement benefits are 
provided by way of an 
allowance which can be 
delivered in cash or as a 
payment to a defined 
contribution arrangement.

Shareholding guideline
The Remuneration Committee encourages Executive Directors to build and hold a shareholding in the Company 
equivalent in value to at least one times gross base salary. For new Executive Directors, the target is to achieve this  
within a four-year period.
Difference between remuneration policy for executive directors and other employees
The Remuneration Committee considers remuneration across Alent when setting remuneration policy for Executive 
Directors and the same principles apply to all employees when determining salary increases. In addition, the Annual 
Incentive and Alent Share Plan are operated for employees who are not Executive Directors. The key difference in  
policy is that variable remuneration represents a greater proportion of Executive Directors' total package than it  
does for other employees.
Choice of performance measures and target setting
For the Annual Incentive and Alent Share Plan, our policy is to choose performance measures which help drive and 
reward the achievement of Alent strategy, and also provide alignment between employees and shareholders. Further 
detail on performance measures and targets is disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
Non-executive Directors Remuneration Policy Table
The following table outlines the remuneration policy for Non-executive Directors of Alent:
Element of 
Remuneration Link to Strategy Operation Opportunity Performance Metrics
Base Fees Reflects the individual's 
experience, role and 
contribution within the 
Company.
The Board sets the 
remuneration of the 
Non-executive Directors 
after considering the  
role and responsibilities  
of each Director and  
the practice of other 
companies. The Non-
executive Directors do  
not participate in Board 
discussions on their  
own remuneration.
No prescribed maximum 
annual increase.
Increases are only  
made if justified by UK 
market benchmarks.
Fees are set at a maximum 
of  500,000 in aggregate.

Independent Director.
No prescribed maximum

Increases are only  
made if justified by UK 
market benchmarks.
n/a
Clawback Arrangements
Variable remuneration paid to Executive Directors is subject to clawback arrangements in the event that a misstatement 
is identified in the Company's consolidated financial statements. When a misstatement is identified by the Remuneration 
Committee which requires the restatement of a prior year's accounts in order to ensure compliance with the requirements 
of International Financial Reporting Standards or any applicable law, then such portion as the Remuneration Committee 
deems appropriate of any variable remuneration paid to Executive Directors (including from both the Annual Incentive 
and the Alent Share Plan and on an after-tax basis) resulting from a measure of financial performance affected by the 
misstatement will be subject to clawback provisions.
External Appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to hold positions as Non-executive Directors of other companies provided that these 
do not lead to conflicts of interest. The Board sanctions each such request on a case-by-case basis. Fees received are 
retained by the Executive Director concerned. 
Policy on Service Contracts and Letters of Appointment
Our policy is to offer service contracts for Executive Directors with notice periods of between six to 12 months.  
Service contracts do not contain any change of control provisions. In the event of termination upon notice by either  
the Company or an Executive Director, the Company has the option of making a payment in lieu of any notice due,  
a significant part of which is subject to offset against subsequent income earned by the Executive Director.
For the Chairman, appointment is terminable on six months' notice. All other Non-executive Directors' appointments are 
terminable on three months' notice on either side. All Non-executive Directors are subject to retirement, and election or 
re-election, in accordance with the Company's Articles of Association and now stand for re-election annually. STRATEGIC

Exit Payment Policy
This Exit Payment Policy sets out the framework on how 
termination payments will be calculated for each element 
of Directors' remuneration together with the policy on the 
setting of notice periods.
An Executive Director's appointment is terminable by the 
Company on not less than 12 months' written notice, and by 
the Executive on not less than six months' written notice. In the 
case of termination, the Company can choose to make a 
payment in lieu of notice for part or all of the notice period. 
Any such payment in lieu will be no greater than base salary, 
pension contributions and the value of benefits to which the 
Director would have been entitled for the duration of the 
remaining notice period, net of statutory deductions in each 
case. Half of this payment will be made in a lump sum, the 
remainder in six equal monthly installments. If the Director  
finds a role paying equivalent or better base salary or fees,  
no further installments shall be payable, and the value of  
any lesser new base salary or fees shall be deducted from 
any further instalments.
Executives have no contractual right to an annual bonus 
award. However, if the Committee determines that an 
annual bonus should be payable after an executive has 
served notice, then annual bonus payments will be 
pro-rated for time served during the year and paid after 
the completion of the termination year's performance 
period as aligned to plan guidelines.
Under the rules of the Alent Share Plan, awards will lapse  
in full unless specified good leaver  circumstances apply.  
These circumstances include:
  retirement;
  ill health;
  injury or disability;
  redundancy;
  death;
  employment with a company which ceases to be  
a Group member or relating to a business or part  
of a business which is transferred to a person who  
is not a group member; and
  any other reason as the Committee decides.
Where the Committee exercises its discretion to treat an 
Executive Director as a good leaver it will take into account the 
individual's performance and the reasons for their departure.
Good leavers' awards of performance shares or market-
priced options made under the Alent Share Plan normally 
vest at the usual time unless the Committee determines 
that they should vest earlier. However, they are always 
subject to the achievement of any performance criteria. 
Good leavers' awards of deferred shares relating to the 
Annual Incentive will vest on the date of termination since 
there are no performance conditions needed to be met.  
In addition, awards normally will be pro-rated to reflect the 
time employed from the award date unless, under normal 
circumstances, the Committee determines otherwise. 
In addition, no contractual arrangements have been 
made prior to the coming into effect of the regulations  
that could impact on the quantum of Directors'  
termination payments. 
The Non-executive Directors are not entitled to receive 
compensation for loss of office at any time. The Chairman 
is entitled to six month's notice.
Policy on Recruitment Remuneration
The Company will follow the principle that the 
remuneration package for a new Director would be set in 
accordance with the terms of the approved remuneration 
policy in force at the time of appointment. This means that 
the maximum level of variable remuneration (such as 
bonus and long-term incentive awards) would be in line 
with the maximums set out in the policy table in force at  
the time of appointment. Currently these maximums are:
  Annual Incentive: 150% of base salary.
   Alent Share Plan: 200% of base salary for performance 
shares; or 300% of base salary for market-priced options.
However, the Committee may offer additional cash  
and/or share-based elements to buy out  remuneration 
lost when leaving a former employer. These elements of 
remuneration, including awards made under Listing Rule 
9.4.2 R, will only be offered when the Committee considers 
them to be in the best interests of the Company and, 
therefore, shareholders. Any such buy out  payments 
would be based solely on remuneration lost when leaving 
the former employer and would reflect (as far as 
practicable) the delivery mechanism (i.e. cash, shares, 
options), time horizons and performance requirements 
attaching to that remuneration. Shareholders will be 
informed of any such payments at the time of appointment. 
In the case of an internal appointment, any variable pay 
element awarded in respect of the prior role may be 
allowed to pay out according to its terms on grant, 
adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. 
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations 
existing prior to appointment may continue, provided that 
they are put to shareholders for approval at the first AGM 
following their appointment.
Other aspects of our recruitment policy include:
  Where it is appropriate to offer a below-median salary  
to a new Executive Director, a series of increases to the 
desired salary positioning may be given over the 
proceeding few years subject to individual performance 
and experience in role.
  Different performance measures may be set initially for 
the annual bonus, taking into account the responsibilities 
of the individual, and the point in the financial year that 
they joined.
  A new Director may receive fees for professional advice 
as appropriate.
  A new Director may receive relocation assistance as stated 
in the Executive Directors Remuneration Policy Table. 72   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

Consideration of Group Employee Conditions
Although there is no formal consultation with employees in 
the company in drawing up Directors' remuneration policy, 
the policy is aligned to the overall compensation guideline 
of driving high performance which is applicable to all Alent 
employees. There are no specified comparison metrics 
taken into account when determining Directors' 
remuneration policy. 
Consideration of Shareholder Views
Alent is committed to open and transparent dialogue  
with its shareholders on remuneration as well as other 
governance matters. All views expressed by Alent's 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting or during  
the reported financial year are taken into account by  
the Committee when making decisions relating to the 
Directors' remuneration policy. In relation to any changes 
to the Directors' remuneration policy, the Committee will 
typically consult with shareholders before such changes 
are submitted for shareholder approval so that shareholder 
views can be taken into account.
In normal circumstances, we expect to submit the 
Directors' remuneration policy once every three years. 
However, Alent will include the policy section on an annual 
basis to provide consistency and make cross-referencing 
easier for the reader.  STRATEGIC

Key areas of discretion
Key areas of discretion in the application of our 
remuneration policy include, but are not limited to:
  The choice of financial performance measures in variable 
remuneration and the choice of performance targets for 
those measures;
  The choice of whether to pay an annual bonus to an 
Executive Director who is serving their notice period;
  Discretion in exceptional circumstances to amend 
previously set incentive targets or to adjust the proposed 
payout to ensure a fair and appropriate outcome;
  Certain decisions relating to the Alent Share Plan as set 
out in the plan rules regarding change of control and 
leaver provisions.
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
This section of the Directors' remuneration report explains 
how the Directors' remuneration policy as set out in the 
Remuneration Policy Report will be implemented in 2014, 
and how it has been implemented in 2013. 
Implementation of the Remuneration Policy in 2014
Remuneration in 2014 will be broadly the same  
as in 2013, but with some changes to the Annual  
Incentive arrangements.
Base Salary
The Committee has reviewed base salaries in line with 
policy and has decided that base salaries for the Executive 
Directors will be increased by 2.5% in line with the workforce 
general increase of 2.5%. This means that effective  
1 January 2014, the base salaries for Steve Corbett and 
David Egan will be  464,333 (converted from USD to GBP at 
a fixed exchange rate of 1.6556) and  317,750 respectively. 
NED fees
In 2013 the base Non-executive Director fee was  45,000 
and  165,000 for the Chairman. Additional fees to 
Committee Chairmen were  15,000, and additional  
fees for the Senior Independent Director were  5,000.  
The Committee reviewed the fee structure during the year 
and determined that the fees will remain at the same level.
Annual Incentive
The Annual Incentive (AI) performance measures will  
be changed in 2014 better to align the annual bonus 
opportunity with Alent's strategy. Accordingly, while there 
will be continued focus on EPS targets for 2014 there will be 
an additional measure for the achievement of NSV margin. 
As a result, the performance measures along with the 
respective percentages that form the basis of an 
individual's total AI target opportunity for 2014 will be:
  Adjusted EPS Targets (50% of total opportunity);
  Return on NSV Margin (30%) - Calculated as adjusted 
operating profit divided by net sales value;
  Personal Objectives (20%).
As set out in the Annual Statement and Policy Report,  
the maximum opportunity for the Chief Executive and 
Finance Director will be 150% and 125% of base salary, 
respectively. In addition, half of any bonus paid above 
target will be deferred in shares for three years to increase 
alignment between the long-term interests of executives 
and shareholders. 
Alent Share Plan awards 
The Committee intends to make grants of 200% of salary to 
each of the Executive Directors in 2014. The performance 
condition relating to these awards will be disclosed in next 
year's annual report on remuneration.  74   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

ANNUAL INCENTIVE
In 2013 Annual Incentive payments for the Chief Executive and Finance Director were based on adjusted EPS and a 
Working Capital adjustor. As the adjusted EPS target was not achieved, no bonus was payable for performance over 
2013. Full disclosure of the bonus calculation is provided below:

ALENT SHARE PLAN VESTING
Awards shown in the 2013 single figure represent the grants made to Executive Directors in 2011 under the Cookson 
Group plc (Cookson) LTIP for which the performance period ended on 31 December 2013. These awards were rolled 
over to become awards over Alent shares of equivalent value after the demerger and were due to vest in April 2014. 
The performance condition for these awards is measured over a three-year period, but by reference to Cookson 
performance up to the Demerger Effective Time and by reference to Alent performance thereafter to the end of the 
period. The awards continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the existing Cookson LTIP, save that the 
relevant company (and relevant remuneration committee) is Alent instead of Cookson.  76   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM
Vesting of 50% of these awards is based on adjusted EPS growth, whilst the remaining 50% is based on TSR growth relative to a 
comparator group. As shown in the tables below, both of the targets were not achieved at the end of the performance period:

The information in the above table is audited by the Company's Auditor. Further detail on the performance conditions is 
set out below.
PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS RELATING TO AWARDS MADE UNDER THE ALENT SHARE PLAN
In the case of Alent Share Plan grants for which the performance period ends on 31 December 2014, these represent the 
grants made to Executive Directors in 2012 under the Cookson LTIP. These awards over Cookson shares were rolled over 
to become awards over Alent shares of equivalent value. Performance will still be measured over a three-year period, 
but by reference to Cookson performance up to the Demerger Effective Time and by reference to Alent performance 
thereafter to the end of the period. The awards continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the existing 
Cookson LTIP, save that the relevant company (and relevant remuneration committee) is Alent instead of Cookson.
The vesting of the awards, when originally granted, was based on Cookson's performance against specified 
performance conditions measured over a three-year period. Vesting of 50% of shares awarded was based upon 
Cookson's three-year TSR performance relative to that of the constituent companies of the FTSE 250, excluding 
Investment Trusts, and 50% on EPS growth over the three-year period. The two measures operated independently.
The new Alent targets for measuring performance for the 2011 and 2012 Cookson LTIP awards, following the Demerger, 
have been determined as follows:
  As regards the EPS target, the Cookson headline EPS threshold and maximum vesting targets for the final year of the 
relevant three-year performance period have been split between Alent and Vesuvius by reference to their respective 
trading profit contributions to Cookson's total 2012 trading profit such that the new Alent and Vesuvius targets 
aggregate to the currently disclosed Cookson targets. The respective Alent adjusted EPS values as reported for the final 
year of the three-year performance period will then be compared with these new threshold and maximum targets to 
determine the vesting outcome. STRATEGIC

  As regards the TSR target, Cookson's TSR growth from the start of the relevant three-year performance period up to the 
time of the Demerger will be determined and added to the TSR growth of Alent from the Demerger date to the end  
of the three-year performance period. This aggregate TSR growth will then be ranked against the TSR of the relevant 
comparator group and the resulting vesting outcome will be calculated against the TSR performance schedule in  
the Cookson LTIP.

the target is to achieve this within a four-year period.
As at 31 December 2013, Steve Corbett held 132,392 shares in Alent and David Egan held 10,082 shares in Alent. Using 
the Company's closing share price at 31 December 2013 of 355p, this represents 104% of base salary (gross, pre-tax) for 
Steve Corbett, and 12% of base salary (gross, pre-tax) for David Egan.

Performance graph and table
Given that Alent did not exist until 19 December 2012, it is not possible to produce a graph which compares the 
Company's TSR over the past five years with the return on an appropriate index (in compliance with the Large & Medium 
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts & Report) Regulations 2008). For completeness, and in accordance with the 
Regulations, the graph below does compare the Company's TSR over the shortened period from the Demerger to  
31 December 2012 with the return on the FTSE 250 index (excluding Investment Trusts) through 31 December 2013.  
This index has been chosen as the comparator index to reflect the size, international scope and diversity of the Company. 
The table following the chart shows the single figure remuneration for the Chief Executive over the same period.

Share Usage
Under the rules of the Plan the Company has the discretion to satisfy awards either by the transfer of existing shares or by 
the allotment of newly issued shares. The decision on how to satisfy awards is taken by the Board, which considers the 
most prudent and appropriate sourcing arrangement for the Company.
The Alent Share Plan complies with the current ABI guidelines on headroom which provide that overall dilution under all 
plans should not exceed 10% over a ten-year period in relation to the Company's issued share capital, with a further 
limitation of 5% in any ten-year period on discretionary schemes.
Details of the awards granted to Executive Directors and outstanding under the Cookson LTIP as at 31 December 2012 
and outstanding awards under the Alent Share Plan are given in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements and 
note 10 to the Company financial statements.
