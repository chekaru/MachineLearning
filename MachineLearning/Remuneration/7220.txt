 Report on the Directors' Remuneration
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations
2002 (the 'regulations') which introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of Directors'
remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002. It has been approved by
the Directors and will be put to the shareholders for approval at the Annual General meeting on 24
June 2003.
The regulations require the auditors to report to the Company's members on the auditable part of
the Directors' Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations).
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Information not subject to audit
The remuneration policy for Directors is set by the Board and is described below. The remuneration of
Executive Directors is determined by the Remuneration Committee within the framework of this policy.
The Remuneration Committee consists entirely of Non-Executive Directors and is chaired by Mr D W
Dunn. The other members of the Committee during this year were Mr R T Wynn-Jones and Mr R
Broderick. Mr R Broderick resigned from the Committee on 25 June 2002. Mr C A Marsh was
appointed to the Committee on 25 March 2003.
The Committee consults with Mr J R Budd, the Chief Executive, as appropriate with regard to its
proposals relating to the remuneration of the Executive Directors. 
Remuneration Policy
The policy of the Committee is to review the Executive Directors' remuneration based on market
practice within the Company's market sector. The Group wishes to attract, motivate and retain key
executives. Accordingly, its policy is to design remuneration packages which, through an appropriate
combination of basic salary, performance related bonuses, share options, pension arrangements and
certain benefits, reward executives fairly and responsibly for their individual contributions, whilst linking
their potential earnings to the performance of the Group as a whole. The overall package, which will
be reviewed on a regular basis, may contain the following elements :-
Basic salaries
Basic salaries for Executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Committee and are set at levels
which reflect their performance, degree of responsibility, achievement of objectives and ensure that
they are competitive with pay for Executive Directors holding equivalent positions in comparable companies.
Performance related bonus
Executive Directors participate in a bonus scheme which is linked to the achievement of demanding
individual, business and corporate objectives. These bonuses are at the discretion of the Remuneration
Committee. No bonuses were paid during the year.
Pensions benefits
Mr J R Budd, Mr M Foyle and Mr R Lakhani are members of the Alexandra 1994 Pension Fund which
is a contributory defined benefit scheme. The Company contributes 8.9% of pensionable salary. For Mr
J R Budd pensionable salary is based on gross taxable remuneration excluding performance related
bonus while for Mr M Foyle and Mr R Lakhani, pensionable salary relates to basic salary only.
Under the Alexandra 1994 Pension Fund pensions accrue at 1/60th of pensionable pay for each year
of service. In addition, life assurance of four times basic salary and a pension of one half of the
member's entitlement for spouses on their death in service are provided. Pension increases in
retirement in line with the Retail Price Index, to a maximum of 3% per annum
.
Details of the Directors' accrued pensions are shown on page 18.
16 Alexandra plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Alexandra plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 17
As the defined benefit scheme is closed to new entrants, the company contributes 5% of basic salary
to Mr R Michell's personal pension scheme. During the year, the Company paid  4,000 into
Mr R Michell's personal pension scheme.
Executive Share Option Scheme
The Executive Share Option Scheme was adopted on 30 November 1984 and renewed at the Annual
General Meeting on 6 June 1994. As set out on page 19 share options were granted to the Executive
Directors on 5 November 2002 at the then current market price of 51.7p.
There are no specific performance criteria as the Committee considered that the movement in share
price would reflect the performance of the Company.
Other benefits
Other benefits include the provision of a company car (or car allowance in lieu of a car) and private
health insurance.
Service contracts
Mr J R Budd has a service contract terminable by the Company on two years notice. The Remuneration
Committee considers that this contract is essential to retain and motivate a Director who has
considerable experience and service within this industry.  The Board does not intend to reduce this
notice period.  Mr M Foyle, Mr R Lakhani and Mr R Michell have twelve month rolling contracts.
The Non-Executive Directors are on twelve month's fixed term contracts which expire as follows:
Mr D W Dunn 31 January 2004
Mr R T Wynn-Jones 30 September 2003
Mr C A Marsh 31 March 2004
Total shareholder return
The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the presentation of a performance
graph of the total shareholder return (TSR) compared to a comparator for a period of five years. The
FTSE All Share Index has been selected as it is widely based and Alexandra supplies clothing to a wide
range of industries.
TSR is shown as the value of  100 invested in Alexandra and in the FTSE All Share Index over the five
year period. TSR is calculated for each half year relative to the base date of 1 February 1998 by taking
the percentage change of the market price over the relevant period and reinvesting any dividends at
the ex-dividend date.
