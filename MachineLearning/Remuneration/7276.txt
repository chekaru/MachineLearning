Alexandra plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006
REPORT ON THE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the
Regulations ).  It has been approved by the Directors and will be put to the Shareholders for approval at the
Annual General Meeting on 27 June 2006.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company's members on the auditable part  of the Report
on the Directors' Remuneration and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations).  The report has therefore
been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Information not subject to audit
The remuneration policy for Directors is set by the Board and is described below.  It is determined by the
Remuneration Committee within the framework of this policy.  The remuneration of Executive Directors
is determined by the Remuneration Committee which consists entirely of Non-Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee whose members during the year comprised Mr C A Marsh and  Mr R T Wynn-
Jones was chaired by Mr C A Marsh.
The Committee consults with Mr J R Budd, the Chief Executive, as appropriate with regard to its proposals
relating to the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
Remuneration policy
The policy of the Remuneration Committee is to review the Executive Directors' remuneration based on
market practice within the Company's market sector.  The Group wishes to attract, motivate and retain key
executives.  Accordingly, its policy is to design remuneration packages which, through an appropriate
combination of basic salary, long term incentive plan, performance share plan, performance related bonuses,
share options, pension arrangements and certain benefits, reward executives fairly and responsibly for their
individual contributions, whilst linking their potential earnings to the performance of the Group as a whole.
The overall package, which will be reviewed on a regular basis, may contain the following elements:-
(a) Basic salaries
Basic salaries for Executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee and are set at 
levels which reflect their performance, degree of responsibility, achievement of objectives and ensure that 
they are competitive with pay for Executive Directors holding equivalent positions in comparable companies. 
(b) Long term incentive plan (LTIP)
In 2005, following shareholder approval the Company established the Alexandra plc Long Term Incentive 
Plan 2005. The Remuneration Committee believes that this LTIP aligns the interests of Shareholders and 
Executives, to drive performance of the business forward over the short to medium term, to lock in key 
Executives and to motivate them through the opportunity to earn significant financial rewards on the 
achievement of demanding performance targets.
The key features are: cash bonuses to be paid based on achievement of adjusted market capitalisation 
targets as a measure of total shareholder return, with an earnings per share based underpin; bonuses will 
be paid in three annual tranches, with payments in years two and three adjusted if the Company under 
performs in those years; a proportion of the bonus must be reinvested in Company shares each year and 
these shares cannot be disposed of for at least two years; the maximum payable in any one financial year 
(including accruals tranches from previous years) will be set at 1.5 times base salary.
(c) Performance share plan
The Remuneration Committee propose the introduction of the Alexandra plc Performance Share Plan 
2006. A key element of the Group's growth strategy relies upon senior management being incentivised to 
increase shareholder value. The Committee considers the Performance Share Plan will assist the aim by 
awarding participants with nominal price share options. This Plan will also increase equity participation of 
the management team and further align the interests of the Directors with those of the Shareholders. 56
Challenging performance targets will be set by the Remuneration Committee and will initially comprise a 
combination of earnings per share performance, measured against Consumer Price Index and total 
shareholder return measured against the performance of the FTSE 350. Shares acquired under the plan 
must be held for a minimum of two years. The award will be limited to an aggregate market value of 
shares in one year up to a maximum of 1.5 times base salary.
The Plan has been constructed following consultation with key institutional  shareholders and a summary of
the plan is included on pages 59 and 60, and in the separate document accompanying the Annual Report 
and Accounts 2006 containing the notice convening the Annual General Meeting.
(d) Performance related bonus
The Committee can award discretionary bonuses, which are linked to the achievement of demanding 
individual, business and corporate objectives.
(e) Pension benefits
Mr J R Budd is a member of the Alexandra 1994 Pension Fund and receives defined benefits under the Fund.  
For Mr J R Budd, pensionable salary is based on gross taxable remuneration excluding performance related bonus.
The Alexandra 1994 Pension Fund provides pensions of up to two thirds of final pensionable salary, 
dependent on length of service.  In addition, life assurance of up to four times basic salary and a pension of
one half of the member's entitlement for spouses on their death in service are provided apart from Mr J R 
Budd where the benefit is two thirds.  Pensions increase in retirement in line with the Retail Price Index to a
maximum of 5% per annum.
Details of the Directors' accrued pensions are shown on page 58.
As the defined benefit scheme is closed to new entrants, the Company contributes 7.5% of basic salary for
Mr K Gibbs and 3% of basic salary for Mr J Tucker to the Alexandra's Retirement Benefit Scheme.  During 
the year, the Company paid  9,000 into the pension scheme for Mr K Gibbs and  3,000 for Mr J Tucker.  
(f) Executive Share Option Scheme
The Executive Share Option Scheme was adopted on 30 November 1984 and renewed at the Annual General
Meeting on 6 June 1994. Share options held by Directors are set out on page 58.  No share options were 
granted to the Executive Directors during the year.
There are no specific performance criteria as the Committee considered that the movement in share price 
would reflect the performance of the Company.
No further grants can be made under this scheme.
(g) Other benefits
Other benefits include the provision of a company car (or car allowance in lieu of a car) and private health 
insurance.
(h) Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors are independent of management and have no relationship which could 
materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.  The remuneration of the Non-
Executive Directors is decided by the Executive Directors on advice from relevant external organisations.
They are not eligible for performance related remuneration or other benefits.
Service contracts
It is Company's policy that all Executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a
maximum of one year's notice.
Accordingly in line with the Company policy and the provisions of the Combined Code Mr J R Budd's Service
Contract was amended from 1 February 2006, thereby reducing the notice period from two years to one year.
For Mr K P Gibbs and Mr J A Tucker the notice period is one year.
In the event of early termination Mr J R Budd is entitled to be credited with one year's pensionable service.
In addition if the Company makes a payment in lieu of notice this payment will not be subject to mitigation.

Total Shareholder Return
The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the presentation of a performance graph of
the total shareholder return (TSR) compared to a comparator for a period of five years.  The FTSE All Share
Index has been selected as it is widely based and Alexandra supplies clothing to a wide range of industries.
TSR is shown as the value of  100 invested in Alexandra and in the FTSE All Share Index over the five year
period.  TSR is calculated for each half year relative to the base date of 1 February 2001 by taking the
percentage change of the market price over the relevant period and reinvesting any dividends at the
ex-dividend date.
