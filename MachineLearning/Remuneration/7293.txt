business objectives not being achieved and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss.
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group has
been established and was operational throughout the year to 31 January 2007.  The process is regularly
reviewed by the Board and accords with Internal Control - Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code 
produced by the Turnbull working party.
The management of all forms of business risk is an important part of ensuring the Group creates and
protects value for its Shareholders.  The process involves the identification of specific risks in many different
areas, the assessment of those risks in terms of their potential impact, the likelihood of them materialising
and then decisions as to the most appropriate method of managing them.  The latter may include regular
monitoring, investment in additional resources, transfer to third parties via insurance or hedging agreements
and contingency planning.
The Board has reviewed the need for an internal audit function and has concluded that sufficient internal
controls exist within the Group and that the operation is not large enough to warrant a dedicated internal
audit function.  However, the Group did undertake a number of specific audit procedures during the course
of the year.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee which is chaired by Mr C A Marsh and comprises the Non-Executive Directors, met
twice during the year.  All members attended every meeting. Other Board members attended the Committee
meetings at the invitation of the Committee Chairman. Mr C A Marsh is considered to have the most recent
and relevant financial experience required for this role.
The Committee is responsible for reviewing a wide range of matters including the half year and annual
financial statements before submission to the Board, corporate public announcements prior to their release
and for monitoring the internal financial controls which are in place to ensure the integrity of information
reported to the Shareholders.  The Audit Committee advises the Board on the appointment and
remuneration of the external auditors and discusses the nature, scope and results of the audit with the
external auditors.  In addition, the Committee reviews the performance of the Company's external auditors,
Smith & Williamson Solomon Hare Audit LLP and the effectiveness of their audit process.
The Committee regularly monitors the non-audit services being provided by the external auditors to ensure
their objectivity and independence is not compromised.  During the year the non-audit work carried out
included tax compliance.
The Committee is of the opinion that the nature of this work does not prejudice the auditors' independence
and objectivity and accordingly a resolution to re-appoint Smith & Williamson Solomon Hare Audit LLP will be
proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Corporate and Social Responsibility
We believe that sound social, ethical and environmental practices make good business sense and have
embraced these principles in our general operations.
The Group is committed to providing equal opportunities irrespective of sex, age, marital status, disability,
sexual orientation, race, colour, ethnic or national origin or religious belief.  Our employment policies provide
a structure in which our staff can develop and achieve their ambitions and are regularly reviewed to ensure
compliance with current employment legislation and good practice.
We recognise that we are part of all the individual communities that we serve as well as of the wider
national community.  As such, we encourage and support a number of charitable initiatives and sponsor staff
fundraising efforts for a variety of causes.

The Group's operations are executed at all times in such a way as to ensure, so far as reasonably practical,
the Health, Safety and Welfare of all of our employees and all other persons who may be affected by our
operations.  We are committed to the prevention of accidents and regularly review and update procedures
and training to ensure that, as far as possible, staff minimise any risks associated with their tasks.
All areas of the Group operate in accordance with the Group's Environmental Policy.  We recognise the
impact of our operations on the environment and our aim is to reduce this impact and to operate in an
environmentally responsible manner.  The Group and its employees undertake to act, whenever necessary,
to meet the standards of current environmental legislation and continue to review the policies, systems and
services to this end.  All waste generated is properly disposed of in accordance with current legislation and
steps are taken to recycle waste wherever practical.
The Company has carried out an initial review of the significant environmental impacts of its operations. As
a result, a review of energy saving opportunities was carried out in conjunction with The Carbon Trust, and
a number of initiatives are being implemented.  A review of waste materials sent to landfill or recycled is
currently underway to identify potential for future improvements.
The Group requires its suppliers to comply with the ethical and environmental standards detailed in our
quality manual, and performs checks on them using our own staff and also employs independent
consultants to carry out audits.  The Group will only purchase from companies that meet core minimum
requirements and are prepared to work towards continuous improvement in their operations.

Alexandra plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007
REPORT ON THE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the
Regulations ).  It has been approved by the Directors and will be put to the Shareholders for approval at the
Annual General Meeting on 26 June 2007.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company's members on the auditable part  of the Report
on the Directors' Remuneration and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations).  The report has therefore
been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Information not subject to audit
The remuneration policy for Directors is set by the Board and is described below.  It is determined by the
Remuneration Committee within the framework of this policy.  The remuneration of Executive Directors
is determined by the Remuneration Committee which consists entirely of Non-Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee members during the year comprised Mr C A Marsh, Mr R T Wynn-Jones until
19 April 2006 and Ms E New after that date, and it was chaired by Mr C A Marsh.
The Committee consults with Mr J R Budd, the Chief Executive, as appropriate with regard to its proposals
relating to the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
Remuneration policy
The policy of the Remuneration Committee is to review the Executive Directors' remuneration based on
market practice within the Company's market sector.  The Group wishes to attract, motivate and retain key
executives.  Accordingly, its policy is to design remuneration packages which, through an appropriate
combination of basic salary, long term incentive plan, performance share plan, performance related bonuses,
share options, pension arrangements and certain benefits, reward executives fairly and responsibly for their
individual contributions, whilst linking their potential earnings to the performance of the Group as a whole.
The overall package, which will be reviewed on a regular basis, may contain the following elements:-
(a) Basic salaries
Basic salaries for Executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee and are set at 
levels which reflect their performance, degree of responsibility, achievement of objectives and ensure that 
they are competitive with pay for Executive Directors holding equivalent positions in comparable companies. 
(b) Long term incentive plan (LTIP)
In 2005, following shareholder approval the Company established the Alexandra plc Long Term Incentive 
Plan 2005. The Remuneration Committee believes that this LTIP aligns the interests of Shareholders and 
Executives, to drive performance of the business forward over the short to medium term, to lock in key 
Executives and to motivate them through the opportunity to earn significant financial rewards on the 
achievement of demanding performance targets.
The key features are: cash bonuses to be paid based on achievement of adjusted market capitalisation 
targets as a measure of total shareholder return, with an earnings per share based underpin; bonuses will 
be paid in three annual tranches, with payments in years two and three adjusted if the Company under 
performs in those years; a proportion of the bonus must be reinvested in Company shares each year and 
these shares cannot be disposed of for at least two years; the maximum payable in any one financial year 
(including accruals tranches from previous years) will be set at 1.5 times base salary.
(c) Performance share plan
In 2006 following shareholder approval, the Alexandra plc Performance Share Plan 2006 was established. 
The Remuneration Committee believes that this plan will incentivise the senior management to increase 
shareholder value by awarding the participants with nominal price share options, increasing the equity 
participation of the management team and further aligning the interest of the Directors with that of 
Shareholders.
Report&Accounts 2007.qxp  18/5/07  14:39  Page 55 54
Challenging performance targets are set by the Remuneration Committee, initially comprising a 
combination of earnings per share performance, measured against Consumer Price Index and total 
shareholder return measured against the performance of the FTSE 350. Shares acquired under the plan 
must be held for a minimum of two years. The award will be limited to an aggregate market value of 
shares in one year up to a maximum of 1.5 times base salary.
(d) Performance related bonus
The Committee can award discretionary bonuses, which are linked to the achievement of demanding 
individual, business and corporate objectives.
(e) Pension benefits
Mr J R Budd is a member of the Alexandra 1994 Pension Fund and receives defined benefits under the Fund.  
For Mr J R Budd, pensionable salary is based on gross taxable remuneration excluding performance related bonus.
The Alexandra 1994 Pension Fund provides pensions of up to two thirds of final pensionable salary, 
dependent on length of service.  In addition, life assurance of up to four times basic salary and a pension of
one half of the member's entitlement for spouses on their death in service are provided apart from Mr J R 
Budd where the benefit is two thirds.  Pensions increase in retirement in line with the Retail Price Index to a
maximum of 5% per annum.
Details of the Directors' accrued pensions are shown on page 56.
As the defined benefit scheme is closed to new entrants, the Company contributes 7.5% of basic salary for
Mr K Gibbs and 3% of basic salary for Mr J Tucker to the Alexandra Retirement Benefit Scheme.  During 
the year, the Company paid  10,000 into the pension scheme for Mr K Gibbs and  3,000 for Mr J Tucker.  
(f) Executive Share Option Scheme
The Executive Share Option Scheme was adopted on 30 November 1984 and renewed at the Annual General
Meeting on 6 June 1994. Share options held by Directors are set out on page 56.  No share options were 
granted to the Executive Directors during the year.
There are no specific performance criteria as the Committee considered that the movement in share price 
would reflect the performance of the Company.
No further grants can be made under this scheme.
(g) Other benefits
Other benefits include the provision of a company car (or car allowance in lieu of a car) and private health 
insurance.
(h) Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors are independent of management and have no relationship which could 
materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.  The remuneration of the Non-
Executive Directors is decided by the Executive Directors on advice from relevant external organisations.
They are not eligible for performance related remuneration or other benefits.
Service contracts
All Executive Directors have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of one year's notice.
In the event of early termination Mr J R Budd is entitled to be credited with one year's pensionable service.
In addition, if the Company makes a payment in lieu of notice this payment will not be subject to mitigation.
The Non-Executive Directors are on twelve months fixed term contracts which expire as follows:-
Mr C A Marsh - 31 March 2008
Ms E New - 18 April 2008

Total Shareholder Return
The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the presentation of a performance graph of
the total shareholder return (TSR) compared to a comparator for a period of five years.  The FTSE All Share
Index has been selected as it is widely based and Alexandra supplies clothing to a wide range of industries.
The graph below shows relative total shareholder return of the Company over five years when compared
with the FTSE All Share index.  TSR is calculated relative to the base date of 1 February 2001 by taking
the percentage change of the market price over the relevant period and reinvesting any dividends at the
ex-dividend date.
