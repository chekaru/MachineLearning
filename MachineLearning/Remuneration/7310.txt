ALEXANDRA PLC ANNUAL REPORT &ACCOUNTS 2008
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has appointed two formal committees: the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee,
each of which operate within clearly defined terms of reference.
Due to its size, the Board does not consider a permanent Nomination Committee to be appropriate. Instead
such a Committee is formed as required to assess candidates for appointment as a Director.  No such
Committee met during the year.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Non-Executive Directors and met four times last year. All
members attended every meeting. The Code requires that the Committee is chaired by an Independent
Non-Executive Director and comprises two Independent Non-Executive Directors in addition to the Company
Chairman. During the year and the current year to date there were only two members of the Committee,
including the Chairman. Ms E New chaired the Committee. The Committee determines the contract terms,
remuneration and other benefits of each of the Executive Directors. The Chief Executive normally participates
in the discussions of the Remuneration Committee except when his own performance or remuneration is
under review.  Where appropriate, the Committee takes advice from external remuneration consultants. The
Executive Directors determine the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors.  The Report on the Directors'
Remuneration is set out on pages 59 to 62.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Group encourages communication with both its institutional and private shareholders.  The Chairman,
Chief Executive and Finance Director undertake a formal programme of presentations to both shareholders
and prospective shareholders in the periods following the announcement of its full year and interim results
and other appropriate times during the year.  The Board is of the opinion that additional routine meetings
with the Senior Independent Director would not assist further in the dialogue with shareholders.  However,
the Senior Independent Director is available to meet with shareholders at their request.
In addition to the circulation of external brokers' reports to the Board, feedback is provided to the Board and
in particular the Senior Independent Director, on any issues raised by the Shareholders at these meetings.
All Directors are normally present to answer questions at the Annual General Meeting.
ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT
The Board seeks to ensure that its Annual Report and other public financial statements provide a clear
assessment of the Group's position.  On the basis of the current financial projections and facilities available,
the Directors have formed a judgement that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, consider it is
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The Directors have responsibility for the Group's systems of internal control and for regularly reviewing its
effectiveness.  It is recognised that such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of
business objectives not being achieved, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss.
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group has
been established and was operational throughout the year to 31 January 2008.  The process is regularly
reviewed by the Board and accords with Internal Control - Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code 
produced by the Turnbull working party. Corrective action has been taken to rectify an issue concerning stock
valuation within the Group's internal management accounts during the year. This does not affect the
contents of the Annual Report and Accounts.
The management of all forms of business risk is an important part of ensuring the Group creates and
protects value for its shareholders.  The process involves the identification of specific risks in many different
R&A Txt.qxp  28/5/08  10:10  Page 59 areas, the assessment of those risks in terms of their potential impact, the likelihood of them materialising
and then making decisions as to the most appropriate method of managing them.  The latter may include
regular monitoring, investment in additional resources, transfer of risk to third parties via insurance or
hedging agreements and contingency planning.
The Board has reviewed the need for an internal audit function and has concluded that sufficient internal
controls exist within the Group and that the operation is not large enough to warrant a dedicated internal
audit function.  However, the Group did undertake a number of specific audit procedures during the course
of the year.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee, which is chaired by Mr C A Marsh and comprises the Non-Executive Directors, met
twice during the year.  All members attending every meeting.  Other Board members attended the
Committee meetings at the invitation of the Committee Chairman, Mr C A Marsh is considered to have the
most recent and relevant financial experience required for this role.
The Committee is responsible for reviewing a wide range of matters including the half year and annual
financial statements before submission to the Board, corporate public announcements prior to their release
and for monitoring the internal financial controls which are in place to ensure the integrity of information
reported to the shareholders.  The Audit Committee advises the Board on the appointment and
remuneration of the external auditors and discusses the nature, scope and results of the audit with the
external auditors. In addition, the Committee reviews the performance of the Company's external auditors,
Nexia Smith & Williamson LLP, and the effectiveness of their audit process.
The Committee regularly monitors the non-audit services being provided by the external auditors to ensure
their objectivity and independence is not compromised.  During the year the non-audit work carried out
included tax compliance.
The Committee is of the opinion that the nature of this work does not prejudice the auditors' independence
and objectivity, and accordingly a resolution to re-appoint Nexia Smith & Williamson LLP will be proposed at
the Annual General Meeting.

ALEXANDRA PLC ANNUAL REPORT &ACCOUNTS 2008
REPORT ON THE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the
Regulations ).  It has been approved by the Directors and will be put to the shareholders for approval at the
Annual General Meeting on 1 July 2008.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company's members on the auditable part  of the Report
on the Directors' Remuneration and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations).  The report has therefore
been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
INFORMATION NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT
The remuneration policy for Directors is set by the Board and is described below.  It is determined by the
Remuneration Committee within the framework of this policy.  The remuneration of Executive Directors
is determined by the Remuneration Committee which consists entirely of Non-Executive Directors.  The
Remuneration Committee, whose members during the year comprised of Mr C A Marsh and Ms E New,
was chaired by Ms E New.
The Remuneration Committee consults with Mr J R Budd, the Chief Executive, as appropriate with regard to
its proposals relating to the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The policy of the Remuneration Committee is to review the Executive Directors' remuneration based on
market practice within the Company's market sector.  The Group wishes to attract, motivate and retain key
executives.  Accordingly, its policy is to design remuneration packages which, through an appropriate
combination of basic salary, performance related bonuses, share options, pension arrangements and certain
benefits, reward executives fairly and responsibly for their individual contributions, whilst linking their
potential earnings to the performance of the Group as a whole.  The overall package, which will be reviewed
on a regular basis, may contain the following elements:-
(A) BASIC SALARIES
Basic salaries for Executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee and are set at 
levels which reflect their performance, degree of responsibility, achievement of objectives and ensure that 
they are competitive with pay for Executive Directors holding equivalent positions in comparable companies.
(B) LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP) AND PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN
During the year the Alexandra plc Long Term Incentive Plan 2005 and the Alexandra plc Performance Share
Plan 2006 were cancelled as the Remuneration Committee did not believe that the schemes met the future
needs of the business.
There were no awards made under either scheme during the year.
(C)PERFORMANCE RELATED BONUS
The Remuneration Committee can award discretionary bonuses, which are linked to the achievement of 
demanding individual, business and corporate objectives.
(D)PENSION BENEFITS
Mr J R Budd is a member of the Alexandra 1994 Pension Fund and accrues defined benefits under the Fund.
For Mr J R Budd, pensionable salary is based on gross taxable remuneration excluding performance related
bonus.
The Alexandra 1994 Pension Fund provides pensions of up to two thirds of final pensionable salary, 
dependent on length of service.  In addition, life assurance of up to four times basic salary and a pension 
of one half of the member's entitlement for spouses on their death in service are provided apart from
Mr J R Budd where the benefit is two thirds.  Pensions increase in retirement in line with the Retail Price 
Index to a maximum of 5% per annum.
Details of the Directors' accrued pensions are shown on page 62.
R&A Txt.qxp  28/5/08  10:10  Page 61 60
As the defined benefit scheme is closed to new entrants, the Company contributes 7.5% of basic salary for Mr K
Gibbs and contributed 3% of basic salary for Mr J Tucker to the Alexandra's Retirement Benefit Scheme.  During 
the year the Company paid  11,000 into the pension scheme for Mr K Gibbs and  2,000 for Mr J Tucker.  
(E)EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME
The Executive Share Option Scheme was adopted on 30 November 1984 and renewed at the Annual General 
Meeting on 6 June 1994.  Share options held by Directors are set out on page 62.  No share options were granted
to the Executive Directors during the year.
There are no specific performance criteria as the Committee considered that the movement in share price would 
reflect the performance of the Company.
No further grants can be made under this scheme.
(F)OTHER BENEFITS
Other benefits include the provision of a company car (or car allowance in lieu of a car) and private health 
insurance.
(G)NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Non-Executive Directors are independent of management and have no relationship which could 
materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.  The remuneration of the Non-
Executive Directors is decided by the Executive Directors on advice from relevant external organisations.
They are not eligible for performance related remuneration or other benefits.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
All Executive Directors have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of one year's notice.
In the event of early termination Mr J R Budd is entitled to be credited with one year's pensionable service.
In addition, if the Company makes a payment in lieu of notice this payment will not be subject to mitigation.
The Non-Executive Directors are on twelve months fixed term contracts which expire as follows:-
Mr C A Marsh - 31 March 2009
Ms E New - 18 April 2009

TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN
The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the presentation of a performance graph of
the total shareholder return (TSR) compared to a comparator for a period of five years.  The FTSE All Share
Index has been selected as it is widely based and Alexandra supplies clothing to a wide range of industries.
The graph below shows relative total shareholder return of the Company over five years when compared
with the FTSE All Share Index.  TSR is calculated relative to the base date of 1 February 2003 by taking the
percentage change of the market price over the relevant period and reinvesting any dividends at the
ex-dividend date.
