Alexandra plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Due to its size, the Board does not consider a permanent Nomination Committee to be appropriate. Instead such a
Committee is formed as required to assess candidates for appointment as a Director. A Nomination Committee
comprising of Ms E New, Mr J R Budd and Mr K Gibbs was formed in October 2008 to consider the appointment of
a new Non-Executive Chairman and a Corporate Operations Director. As there was, at that time, only one Non-
Executive Director, the committee did not have a majority of Independent Non-Executive Directors, as required by
code provision A.4.1. Ms E New chaired the Committee. To assist in the recruitment process for the Non-Executive
Chairman, the Nomination Committee received third party advice and assistance in framing profiles and specifications
from Smith & Williamson. Following a review of the candidates Mr A E Watson and Mr P M Rosser were
recommended by the Nomination Committee for appointment to the Board. The Board accepted the
recommendation made by the Committee.
Since the year end, and relating to the decision of Mr J R Budd and Mr K Gibbs to leave the Board, a nomination
committee comprising of Ms E New and Mr A E Watson was formed in May 2009 to consider the appointment of a
new Finance Director and, if required, an Executive Chairman.The committee was chaired by Ms E New, although, as
she had an interest in one of the items of business, Mr A E Watson took the chair in relation to deliberations regarding
this item. Following a review, Ms E New was recommended by the Nomination Committee for appointment as
Finance Director. The Committee also recommended that pending the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer,
Mr A E Watson be appointed as Executive Chairman. The Board accepted both recommendations, to take effect from
1 June 2009.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Non-Executive Directors and met three times last year. All members
attended every meeting. Code provision B.2.1 requires that the Committee is chaired by an Independent Non-
Executive Director and comprises two Independent Non-Executive Directors in addition to the Company Chairman.
During the year and the current year to date there were only two members of the Committee, including the
Chairman. Ms E New chaired the Committee. The Committee determines the contract terms, remuneration and
other benefits of each of the Executive Directors. The Chief Executive normally participates in the discussions of the
Remuneration Committee except when his own performance or remuneration is under review. Where appropriate,
the Committee takes advice from external remuneration consultants. The Executive Directors determine the
remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors.The Report on the Directors' Remuneration is set out on pages 61 to 64.
Relations with Shareholders
The Group encourages communication with both its institutional and private shareholders. The Chairman, Chief
Executive and Finance Director normally undertake a formal programme of presentations to both shareholders and
prospective shareholders in the periods following the announcement of its full year and interim results and other
appropriate times during the year. In addition, the Senior Independent Director has met with a number of major
shareholders during the year and is generally available to meet with shareholders at their request.
In addition to the circulation of external brokers' reports to the Board, feedback is provided to the Board and in
particular the Senior Independent Director, on any issues raised by the Shareholders at these meetings.
All Directors are normally present to answer questions at the Annual General meeting.
Accountability and Audit
The Board seeks to ensure that its Annual Report and other public financial statements provide a clear assessment of
the Group's position. On the basis of the current financial projections and facilities available, the Directors have formed
a judgement that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, consider it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the financial statements.
The Directors have responsibility for the Group's systems of internal control and for regularly reviewing its
effectiveness. It is recognised that such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of business
objectives not being achieved, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
R&A Txt 09.qxp  26/5/09  19:22  Page 61 60
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group has been
established and was operational throughout the year to 31 January 2009. The process is regularly reviewed by the
Board and accords with Internal Control - Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code  produced by the Turnbull
working party. Corrective action has been taken to rectify an issue concerning stock valuation within the Group's
internal management accounts during the year. This does not affect the contents of the Annual Report and Accounts.
The management of all forms of business risk is an important part of ensuring the Group creates and protects value
for its shareholders. The process involves the identification of specific risks in many different areas, the assessment of
those risks in terms of their potential impact, the likelihood of them materialising and then making decisions as to the
most appropriate method of managing them. The latter may include regular monitoring, investment in additional
resources, transfer of risk to third parties via insurance or hedging agreements and contingency planning.
The Board has reviewed the need for an internal audit function and has concluded that sufficient internal controls exist
within the Group and that the operation is not large enough to warrant a dedicated internal audit function. However,
the Group did undertake a number of specific audit procedures during the course of the year.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the Non-Executive Directors and met twice during the year. In April 2008 it was
chaired by Mr C A Marsh, who was the Company Chairman at the time and therefore did not comply with code
provision C.3.1. The Audit Committee has subsequently been chaired by Ms E New, the Senior Independent Director.
Ms E New is considered to have the most recent and relevant financial experience required for this role. Both
Non-Executive directors attended the meeting in April 2008. Following the resignation of Mr C A Marsh, Ms E New
was the only Non-Executive director present at the meeting in September 2008, which did not comply with code
provision C.3.1. Other Board members attended the Committee meetings at the invitation of the Committee
Chairman.
The Committee is responsible for reviewing a wide range of matters including the half year and annual financial
statements before submission to the Board, corporate public announcements prior to their release and for monitoring
the internal financial controls which are in place to ensure the integrity of information reported to the shareholders.
The Audit Committee advises the Board on the appointment and remuneration of the external auditors and discusses
the nature, scope and results of the audit with the external auditors. In addition, the Committee reviews the
performance of the Company's external auditors, Nexia Smith & Williamson LLP , and the effectiveness of their audit
process.
The Committee regularly monitors the non-audit services being provided by the external auditors to ensure their
objectivity and independence is not compromised. During the year the non-audit work carried out included tax
advisory services and corporate finance advice.
The Committee is of the opinion that the nature of this work does not prejudice the auditors' independence and
objectivity, and accordingly a resolution to re-appoint Nexia Smith & Williamson LLP will be proposed at the Annual
General Meeting.

Report on the Directors' Remuneration
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the
Regulations ). It has been approved by the Directors and will be put to the shareholders for approval at the Annual
General Meeting on 30 June 2009.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company's members on the auditable part  of the Report on the
Directors' Remuneration and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations). The report has therefore been divided into
separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Information Not Subject to Audit
The remuneration policy for Directors is set by the Board and is described below. It is determined by the
Remuneration Committee within the framework of this policy. The remuneration of Executive Directors is determined
by the Remuneration Committee which consists entirely of Non-Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee
members during the year comprised of Ms E New, together with Mr C A Marsh until 18 September 2008 and
Mr A E Watson from 23 September 2008. The Committee was chaired by Ms E New.
The Remuneration Committee consults with Mr J R Budd, the Chief Executive, as appropriate with regard to its
proposals relating to the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
Remuneration Policy
The policy of the Remuneration Committee is to review the Executive Directors' remuneration based on market
practice within the Company's market sector. The Group wishes to attract, motivate and retain key executives.
Accordingly, its policy is to design remuneration packages which, through an appropriate combination of basic salary,
performance related bonuses, share options, pension arrangements and certain benefits, reward executives fairly and
responsibly for their individual contributions, whilst linking their potential earnings to the performance of the Group as
a whole. The overall package, which will be reviewed on a regular basis, may contain the following elements:-
(a) Basic Salaries
Basic salaries for Executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee and are set at levels 
which reflect their performance, degree of responsibility, achievement of objectives and ensure that they are 
competitive with pay for Executive Directors holding equivalent positions in comparable companies.
(b) Performance Related Bonus
The Remuneration Committee can award discretionary bonuses, which are linked to the achievement of demanding
individual, business and corporate objectives.There are currently no long term incentive plans in place. For the 
future, in order to ensure that Executive Directors and Senior management are suitably rewarded and also to 
encourage an alignment between Executives and Shareholders, it is intended that a suitable incentive plan should be 
developed and put forward to the Shareholders for approval in due course.
(c) Pension Benefits
Mr J R Budd is a member of the Alexandra Pension Fund. Mr J R Budd is no longer accruing defined benefits, but is
entitled to a deferred pension that increases in line with inflation over the period until retirement. Mr J R Budd is 
currently receiving benefits on a money purchase basis.
Mr P M Rosser is a member of the Alexandra 1994 Pension Fund and accrues defined benefits under the Fund.
Pensionable salary is based on the highest average of three consecutive tax years' earnings in the last ten years.
The Alexandra 1994 Pension Fund provides pensions of up to two thirds of final pensionable salary, dependent on 
length of service. In addition, life assurance of up to four times basic salary and a pension of one half of the member's
entitlement for spouses on their death in service are provided. Pensions in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions
are increased in accordance with statutory requirements, which are in line with the Retail Price Index to a maximum
of 5% per annum for pension earned between 6 April 1997 and 5 April 2005 and in line with the Retail Prices Index
up to a maximum of 2.5% per annum for pension earned after 5 April 2005.
Details of the Directors' accrued pensions are shown on page 64.
As the defined benefit scheme is closed to new entrants, the Company contributes 7.5% of basic salary for Mr K 
Gibbs to the Alexandra's Retirement Benefit Scheme. During the year the Company paid  11,000 into the pension

(c) Pension Benefits continued
scheme for Mr K Gibbs. In addition to the details on page 63 the Company paid  77,000 into the money purchase
scheme for Mr J R Budd.
(d) Executive Share Option Scheme
The Executive Share Option Scheme was adopted on 30 November 1984 and renewed at the Annual General Meeting 
on 6 June 1994. Share options held by Directors are set out on page 63. No share options were granted to the Executive
Directors during the year.
There are no specific performance criteria as the Committee considered that the movement in share price would reflect 
the performance of the Company.
No further grants can be made under this scheme.
(e) Other Benefits
Other benefits include the provision of a company car (or car allowance in lieu of a car) and private health insurance.
(f) Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors are independent of management and have no relationship which could materially 
interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is 
decided by the Executive Directors on advice from relevant external organisations. They are not eligible for 
performance related remuneration or other benefits.
Service contracts
All Executive Directors have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of one year's notice with
the exception that Mr J R Budd and Mr K Gibbs contracts were varied twice during the year to extend this notice
period in certain circumstances. On 1 July 2008, and for the period from that date until 30 June 2009, their notice
period was extended to 24 months, subject to them relinquishing their right to resign from the Company during this
period and also achieving certain strategic objectives. On 18 September 2008 this agreement was rescinded and
replaced by an agreement under which they were entitled to receive 18 months notice if the Company wished to
terminate their employment at any time in the period between 18 September 2008 and 1 October 2010. In the
event of early termination Mr J R Budd is also entitled to be credited with one year's additional pensionable service.
In addition, if the Company makes a payment in lieu of notice to Mr J R Budd this payment will not be subject to
mitigation.
The Non-Executive Directors are currently on twelve months fixed term contracts which expire as follows:-
Mr A Watson - 23 September 2009
Ms E New - 18 April 2010

T otal Shareholder Return
The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the presentation of a performance graph of the total
shareholder return (TSR) compared to a comparator for a period of five years. The FTSE All Share Index has been
selected as it is widely based and Alexandra supplies clothing to a wide range of industries.
The graph below shows relative total shareholder return of the Company over five years when compared with the
FTSE All Share Index. TSR is calculated relative to the base date of 1 February 2004 by taking the percentage change
of the market price over the relevant period and reinvesting any dividends at the ex-dividend date.
