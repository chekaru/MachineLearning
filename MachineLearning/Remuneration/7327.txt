ALEXON GROUP PLC
REMUNERATION 
REPORT
For the 52 weeks ended 25 January 2003
Remuneration Policy
The Company's policy on remuneration is to offer an overall remuneration package which will
attract and retain high quality executives capable of achieving the Group's objectives.
The remuneration package consists of basic salary, benefits, share options, long term
incentive plan, performance related bonuses and pensions and is set at a level which is
competitive in the context of individual experience, market conditions, and the Group's size and
complexity.
During the period, following consultation with leading shareholders, the Company established
a new Performance Share Plan as a replacement for share options. It is the intention of the board
to grant awards of shares, under the new plan, to executive directors, each year, with a value
of up to 100% of their annual basic salary. Awards will only vest if a specified performance
criteria is satisfied in the future. Awards will normally be made in the form of rights to receive
ordinary shares for a nominal consideration of  1 in total. The performance condition is based
on the Company's average annual compound earnings per share growth measured against
the increase in the Retail Prices Index over a three year period following the grant of an award.
Further details relating to the performance condition are given on page 14.

Year on year total shareholder return growth
Source: Datastream
The above graph shows total shareholder return (TSR) on an annual basis for the last five
years, compared to the FTSE Small Cap Index for the same period. The Company has
outperformed the index for the last two years.
The directors consider the FTSE Small Cap Index to be the most appropriate index against
which to compare total shareholder return as the Index's constituents are companies of a
similar size to Alexon Group plc.

REMUNERATION
REPORT
In order for the directors to exercise any of the performance related options granted under the
rules of the 1995 executive share option scheme prior to 6 October 1999, the Company must
have achieved an increase in earnings per share at least equal to the performance of the upper
quartile of all listed companies in the retailers' general sector for a comparable period.
The rules of the 1995 executive share option scheme were amended at the Extraordinary
General Meeting held on 6 October 1999, for all future grants. The amendments replaced the
four times remuneration limit for individuals with an annual grant limit of one times basic salary,
and introduced a new performance condition. The new performance condition operates on
a sliding scale and allows options to be exercised in respect of half of the shares provided
Alexon's earnings per share growth over three years is at least equal to the median growth of
the constituents of the retailers general sector of the FTSE All-Share Index. Full exercise is allowed
for upper quartile  performance, with the permitted level of exercise for intermediate performance
determined on a straight line basis.
No other directors have been granted share options in the shares of the Company or other
group entities.

The market price of ordinary shares at 27 September 2002 was 179p.
An award will vest only if a specified performance condition has been satisfied. This condition will
be disclosed each year in the Company's annual report and accounts. The condition may be varied
in certain circumstances following the grant of an award so as to achieve its original purpose.
The initial performance condition will be based on the Company's average annual compound
earnings per share (EPS) growth exceeding the Retail Prices Index (RPI) by a specified margin over
the three year period following grant as follows:
Average compound annual EPS
growth above RPI over the
three years from grant Percentage of award that vests
Less than 5% 0%
5% 33%
10% 100%
Awards will vest on a straight line basis between these targets. To the extent that the performance
condition is not satisfied at the end of the three year period after grant, the award will lapse.There
will be no ability to retest performance over subsequent years.
For future awards, different performance conditions may be applied. The Association of British
Insurers and key shareholders will be consulted in the event of different performance conditions
applying to future awards. However no performance conditions that are materially less demanding
than those described above may be applied to future awards without prior shareholder approval.
Awards will lapse six months after they vest unless the remuneration Committee determines
otherwise.
Directors' pension entitlements

The accrued pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age
60 and is based on pensionable service to 25 January 2003.

end and that at the previous period end.

REPORT
the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider
on transferring the scheme's liability in respect of the director's pension benefits. They do not
represent sums payable to individual directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to
annual remuneration.
Whilst members of the scheme have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions, no such
contributions have been made by the directors.
During the period, in addition to the amounts disclosed above, a contribution of  66,560 was
made to a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme for AHA Osborn, together with a
payment of  57,574 to meet the tax liability arising on the contribution.
