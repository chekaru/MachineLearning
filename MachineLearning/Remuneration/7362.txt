During the period the Committee received advice from New Bridge Street Consultants in
connection with the operation of the Alexon Group performance share plan and the Alexon Group
executive share option scheme.
The Committee also takes into account publicly available information, including published salary
trend data, in assessing executive directors' base salary and overall benefits.
Remuneration Policy
The Company's policy on remuneration is to offer an overall remuneration package which will
attract and retain high quality executives capable of achieving the Group's objectives.
The remuneration package is reviewed annually by the Committee and consists of basic salary,
benefits, share options, long term incentive plan, performance related bonuses and pensions and
is set at a level which is competitive in the context of individual experience, market conditions,
and the Group's size and complexity.

to compare total shareholder return as the Index's constituents are companies of a similar size to
Alexon Group plc.

*Performance related options
The market price of ordinary shares at 29 January 2005 was 314.0p and the range during the
financial period was from 293.5p to 363.5p.
The options to subscribe for ordinary shares of the Company are exercisable under the rules of
the 1995 executive share option scheme. 
In order for the directors to exercise any of the performance related options granted under the
rules of the 1995 executive share option scheme prior to 6 October 1999, the Company must
have achieved an increase in earnings per share at least equal to the performance of the upper
quartile of all listed companies in the retailers' general sector for a comparable period.
The rules of the 1995 executive share option scheme were amended at the Extraordinary General
Meeting held on 6 October 1999, for all future grants. The amendments replaced the four times
remuneration limit for individuals with an annual grant limit of one times basic salary, and ALEXON GROUP PLC
13
REMUNERATION
REPORT
introduced a new performance condition. The new performance condition operates on a sliding
scale and allows options to be exercised in respect of half of the shares provided that the
Company's earnings per share growth over three years is at least equal to the median growth of
the constituents of the retailers general sector of the FTSE All-Share Index. Full exercise is allowed
for upper quartile  performance, with the permitted level of exercise for intermediate performance
determined on a straight line basis.
No other directors have been granted share options in the shares of the Company or other group
entities.

An award will vest only if a specified performance condition has been satisfied. This condition
will be disclosed each year in the Company's annual reports and accounts. The condition may
be varied in certain circumstances following the grant of an award so as to achieve its original
purpose.
The initial performance condition will be based on the Company's average annual compound
earnings per share (EPS) growth exceeding the Retail Prices Index (RPI) by a specified margin over
the three year period following grant. For awards made in 2002 and 2003 the performance
criteria is:
Average compound annual Percentage of 
EPS growth above RPI award that vests
Less than 5% 0%
5% 33%
10% and above 100%
Awards will vest on a straight line basis where EPS growth is between 5% and 10% above RPI. 14

REPORT
For awards made in 2004 the performance criteria is:
Average compound annual Percentage of 
EPS growth above RPI award that vests
Less than 3% 0%
3% 33%
8% 100%
Awards will vest on a straight line basis where EPS growth is between 3% and 8% above RPI.
To the extent that the performance condition is not satisfied at the end of the three year period
after grant, the award will lapse. There will be no ability to retest performance over subsequent
years. For future awards different performance conditions may be applied. The Association of
British Insurers and key shareholders will be consulted in the event of different performance
conditions applying to future awards. However no performance conditions that are materially less
demanding than those described above may be applied to future awards without prior shareholder
approval.
Awards will lapse six months after they vest unless the remuneration Committee determines otherwise.
Directors' pension entitlements

R.A.K.W. Piggott 7,526 5,955 61,900 57,115 593,789 462,450 131,339
The accrued pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age
60 and is based on pensionable service to 29 January 2005. The increase in the accrued
entitlement is the difference between the accrued benefit at the period end and that at the previous
period end. All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance
with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11. The transfer values of the accrued pension entitlement
represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension
provider on transferring the scheme's liability in respect of the director's pension benefits. They do
not represent sums payable to individual directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully
to annual remuneration. Whilst members of the scheme have the option to pay Additional Voluntary
Contributions, no such contributions have been made by the directors. During the period, in addition
to the amounts disclosed above, a contribution of  85,600 was made to a Funded Unapproved
Retirement Benefit Scheme for A.H.A. Osborn. The accrued tax liability of  80,000 arising on this
contribution will also be paid by the Company when it falls due. Further contributions are to be
made over the period until Mr Osborn's normal retirement date in June 2009 in respect of a deficit
in the value of the FURBS arising from a shortfall in the investment returns achieved since the scheme
was established. The current deficit, including the related income tax and national insurance
contributions, is estimated to be in the order of  750,000. Accordingly a charge of  150,000,
being one-fifth of the total deficit, has been made in the current financial period.
