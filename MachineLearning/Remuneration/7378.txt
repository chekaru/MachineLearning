executive share option scheme.
The Committee also takes into account publicly available information, including published salary
trend data, in assessing executive directors' base salary and overall benefits.
Remuneration Policy
The Company's policy on remuneration is to offer an overall remuneration package which will
attract and retain high quality executives capable of achieving the Group's objectives.
The remuneration package is reviewed annually by the Committee and consists of basic salary,
benefits, share options, long term incentive plan, performance related bonuses and pensions and
is set at a level which is competitive in the context of individual experience, market conditions,
and the Group's size and complexity.

compared to the FTSE Small Cap Index for the same period. The Company has outperformed the

to compare total shareholder return as the Index's constituents are companies of a similar size to
Alexon Group plc.

The market price of ordinary shares at 28 January 2006 was 242p and the range during the
financial period was from 205p to 339p.
The options to subscribe for ordinary shares of the Company are exercisable under the rules of
the 1995 executive share option scheme. These rules were amended at the Extraordinary General
Meeting held on 6 October 1999, for all future grants. The amendments replaced the four times
remuneration limit for individuals with an annual grant limit of one times basic salary, and
introduced a new performance condition. The new performance condition operates on a sliding
scale and allows options to be exercised in respect of half of the shares provided that the
Company's earnings per share growth over three years is at least equal to the median growth of
the constituents of the retailers general sector of the FTSE All-Share Index. Full exercise is allowed
for upper quartile  performance, with the permitted level of exercise for intermediate performance
determined on a straight line basis.
No other directors have been granted share options in the shares of the Company or other group
entities.

An award will vest only if a specified performance condition has been satisfied. This condition
will be disclosed each year in the Company's annual report and accounts. The condition may be
varied in certain circumstances following the grant of an award so as to achieve its original
purpose.
The initial performance condition will be based on the Company's average annual compound
earnings per share (EPS) growth exceeding the Retail Prices Index (RPI) by a specified margin over
the three year period following grant. For awards made in 2002 and 2003 the performance
criteria is:
Average compound annual Percentage of
EPS growth above RPI award that vests
Less than 5% 0%
5% 33%
10% and above100%
Awards will vest on a straight line basis where EPS growth is between 5% and 10% above RPI.
For awards made in 2004 and 2005 the performance criteria is:
Average compound annual Percentage of
EPS growth above RPI award that vests
Less than 3% 0%
3% 33%
8% 100%
Awards will vest on a straight line basis where EPS growth is between 3% and 8% above RPI.

To the extent that the performance condition is not satisfied at the end of the three year period after
grant, the award will lapse. There will be no ability to retest performance over subsequent years.
For future awards, different performance conditions may be applied. The Association of British
Insurers and key shareholders will be consulted in the event of different performance conditions
applying to future awards. However no performance conditions that are materially less demanding
than those described above may be applied to future awards without prior shareholder approval.
Awards will lapse six months after they vest unless the remuneration Committee determines otherwise.

The accrued pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age
60 and is based on pensionable service to 28 January 2006. The increase in the accrued
entitlement is the difference between the accrued benefit at the period end and that at the previous
period end.All transfer values havebeencalculated on thebasis ofactuarialadvice inaccordance
with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11. The transfer values of the accrued pension entitlement
represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension
provider on transferring the scheme's liability in respect of the director's pension benefits. They do
not represent sums payable to individual directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully
to annual remuneration. Whilst members of the scheme have the option to pay Additional
Voluntary Contributions, no suchcontributions havebeen madeby the directors.During the period,
in addition to the amounts disclosed above, a contribution of  430,000 was made to a Funded
Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme for AHA Osborn. The accrued tax liability of  380,000
arising on this contribution will also be paid by the Company when it falls due.
