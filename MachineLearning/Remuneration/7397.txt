Directors' Remuneration Report
For the 52 weeks to 29 January 2011
Members of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, which met on three occasions 
during the period under review, comprises Mr P . Redhead 
(Chairman) and Mr D. Adams. Mr Adams was appointed to 
the Committee following the resignation of Mr A. Moulds on 
31 December 2010. Both Mr Redhead and Mr Adams are 
independent non-executive directors.
During the period the Committee received advice from Hewitt 
New Bridge Street Consultants in connection with the operation 
of the Alexon Group performance share plan and Deloitte LLP in 
relation to overall executive directors' remuneration.
The Committee also takes into account publicly available 
information, including published salary trend data, in assessing 
executive directors' base salary and overall benefits.
Remuneration policy
The Company's policy on remuneration is to offer an overall 
remuneration package which will attract and retain high quality 
executives capable of achieving the Group's objectives.
The remuneration package is reviewed annually by the Committee 
and consists of basic salary, benefits, long-term incentive plan, 
performance related bonuses and pensions, and is set at a level 
which is competitive in the context of individual experience, market 
conditions, and the Group's size and complexity.
Total shareholder return
The above graph shows total shareholder return on a cumulative basis for the last five years, compared to the FTSE Small Cap Index 
for the same period.
The Directors consider the FTSE Small Cap Index to be the most appropriate index against which to compare total shareholder return 
as the Index's constituents are companies of a similar size to Alexon Group plc.

There have been no changes to the Directors' shareholdings 
since the period end.
The Directors have no beneficial interests in any other company 
within the Group.
The Company's Register of Directors' Interests (which is open to 
inspection) contains full details of Directors' shareholdings and 
awards made under the long-term incentive scheme.
Vesting criteria for long-term incentive scheme
Details of the awards made under the long-term incentive 
scheme are provided on page 50.
An award will vest only if a specified performance condition has 
been satisfied and the recipient is still employed by the Group. 
This condition will be disclosed each year in the Group's Annual 
Report and Accounts. The condition may be varied in certain 
circumstances following the grant of an award so as to achieve 
its original purpose.
The initial performance condition on awards vesting up to and 
including 2012 is based on the Company's average annual 
compound earnings per share (EPS) growth exceeding the Retail 
Prices Index (RPI) by a specified margin over the three year 
period following grant as follows:
Average compound annual Percentage of award
EPS growth above RPI that vests
Less than 3% 0%
3% 33%
8% 100%
Awards will vest on a straight-line basis where EPS growth 
is between 3% and 8% above RPI. To the extent that the 
performance condition is not satisfied at the end of the three year 
period after grant, the award will lapse. There will be no ability to 
retest performance over subsequent years.
For awards vesting in 2013 the performance condition is based 
on the Company's earnings per share (EPS) for the financial year 
ending 26 January 2013 as follows:
EPS for the financial year Percentage of award
ending 26 January 2013 that vests
Less than 6.25p Zero
6.25p 33%
 Pro rata between
Between 6.25p and 8.25p 33% and 100%
8.25p or above 100%
The Association of British Insurers and key shareholders will 
be consulted in the event of different performance conditions 
applying to future awards. However, no performance conditions 
which are materially less demanding than those described 
above may be applied to future awards without prior shareholder 
approval.
Awards will lapse six months after they vest unless the 
Remuneration Committee determines otherwise. The maximum 
value of shares awarded under the scheme in each financial 
period is limited to the amount of the recipient's annual salary.
Outside appointments for executive Directors
Executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive 
directors of other companies and retain any associated fees. 
None of the executive Directors have held such positions during 
the period. Alexon Group plc

All executive Directors participate in an annual bonus scheme based on performance in the year. The maximum annual bonus 
opportunity during the year was 100% of salary. It is expected that the Remuneration Committee will set performance targets for 
2012 broadly similar to those for this period.
Benefits in kind relate to medical insurance premiums and rented accommodation.
No Director waived emoluments in respect of the period ended 29 January 2011.
Gains made by Directors under the long-term incentive scheme
None of the shares previously awarded to Directors under the long-term incentive scheme vested during the period and consequently 
no gains were realised.
Long-term incentive scheme
Shares awarded to executive Directors under the long-term incentive scheme are as follows:

Directors' pension entitlements
Company contributions of  50,000 (2010:  50,000) were paid to a personal pension plan in respect of Mrs J. McNally during the period.
Mr J. Boyle's service contract provides for additional payments to a personal pension plan equal to 18% of annual base salary, or 
the option to receive the equivalent amount (less the cost of employer's national insurance contributions) as a supplement to base 
salary. Mr Boyle has chosen the latter option and, therefore, receives an annual amount (paid monthly in arrears) of  24,800, being 
equivalent to 16% of base salary.
