Alfred McAlpine plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2003
Remuneration report
The auditable part of the remuneration report is set out on pages 26 to 27.
INFORMATION NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT
Membership and Constitution of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, comprising the Non-Executive Directors (Mr C D Collins, Mr R E Hough, Mr P H Swatman and, until his retirement on
22nd May, 2003, Mr A M Robb), makes recommendations to the Board on the Company's overall framework for the remuneration of Executive Directors
and certain key senior executives, and also determines their individual remuneration packages (including pension rights and compensation payments).
The Committee consults the Group Chief Executive on the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior executives, and is assisted by the Group
Company Secretary. Inbucon-Meis Limited act as advisor to the Committee and also, when required, to the Company in respect of executive
remuneration and share schemes. Mercer Human Resources Consulting Limited advise the Company on pension matters. Inbucon-Meis and Mercer 
do not provide other services to the Group and neither the Committee nor the Company is aware of any conflict of interest.
Compliance
The Committee is constituted and operates in accordance with the provisions of the Combined Code, as adopted by the UK Listing Authority and
annexed to the Listing Rules ( the Code'). In preparing this report the Board has complied with the provisions of the Code.
Executive Remuneration Policy and Structure
The Group's aim is to provide remuneration packages that are sufficient to attract, motivate and retain Executive Directors of a high calibre. To this end,
surveys and external advice are instrumental in the annual review of salary and benefits packages. The Committee believes that base salary and benefits
for Executive Directors should represent a fair return for employment, but that the total reward for Executive Directors should be derived substantially
from the performance-related elements of the remuneration package (annual bonus and Restricted Share Plan awards). 
Performance-related elements form a significant proportion of the Executive Directors' total remuneration packages, aligning their interests with those
of the shareholders and providing incentives for performance. In designing schemes for performance-related remuneration, the Committee follows the
provisions of the Code. Due consideration is given to performance relative to comparable companies.
There have been no amendments to the terms and conditions of any entitlement of a Director under the long-term incentive scheme (the Restricted
Share Plan) during the year.
Performance Chart
The chart below compares the growth in value of  100 invested in ordinary shares in Alfred McAlpine plc on 1st January, 1999 with the performance
of a similar investment in the shares of the constituents of the FTSE Construction and Building Materials Index and the FTSE Support Services Index.
The Directors are of the view that these constitute a relevant broad equity market index.
Basic Salary
The salary of each Executive Director is determined by the Committee, taking into account his personal performance and the prevailing rates in the
employment market for executives of comparable status, responsibility, skill and position in other companies. When determining Directors' salaries
the Committee is always sensitive to pay and employment conditions throughout the Group. Independent remuneration surveys are commissioned
when required to substantiate salary levels. 
Annual Bonus
The Committee determines annual bonuses on the basis of improvement over the prior year. Potential bonus for the Executive Directors is based on profit
before tax and amortisation compared with target. This is relevant, stretching and designed to enhance the business. The maximum bonus achievable is
50% of salary. The Committee reviews the targets for the Executive Directors annually.
Pensions Policy
With effect from 31st July, 2003, the Alfred McAlpine Pension Plan ( the Pension Plan') was closed to new entrants. Members of this final salary Pension
Plan as at that date retain the link to pensionable salary at their eventual date of leaving in respect of service up to 31st July, 2003, but have ceased to
accrue benefits within the Pension Plan in respect of service after 31st July, 2003. During 2003, the Group contributed  5.2m (2002:  4.5m) to the
Pension Plan, and from 1st January, 2004, it will make an index-linked contribution to the Pension Plan of  3.85m per annum. Employee contributions
into the Pension Plan ceased with effect from 1st August, 2003.
On 1st August, 2003, the Company introduced the McAlpine 2003 Pension Plan ( the 2003 Pension Plan'), which is a contracted-in defined contribution
pension arrangement. The 2003 Pension Plan is operated on behalf of the Company by Eagle Star and is subject to the Stakeholder Pensions regulations.
The minimum employee contribution is 3% of basic salary. Employees may elect to pay additional contributions, some of which will be matched by the
Company, depending on the grade of the employee.

Alfred McAlpine plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2003
Remuneration report | continued
The average Company contribution equates to 5.3% of basic salary ( 1.79m for the five month period). Life assurance cover of four times basic salary is
provided to members of the 2003 Pension Plan, whilst in service with the Group. Dependants' pensions are provided on a member's death in service or in
retirement. In addition, former members of the final salary Pension Plan are currently provided with a further life assurance cover of two times basic
salary, on death in service, which must be used to provide a dependant's pension.
All pension benefits are subject to Inland Revenue limits. It is the Group's policy to provide those executives who joined the Company after May 1989,
and who are subject to the earnings cap ( 99,000 in the 2003/04 tax year), with appropriate pension benefits outside the pension arrangements outlined
above in relation to that part of their salary which exceeds the cap. Executive Directors retire at age 62.
The Remuneration Committee takes into consideration the impact of basic salary increases upon pension and associated employment costs.
Share Schemes
The Company currently operates the Alfred McAlpine Executive Share Option Scheme 2000 ( the ESOS 2000') and the Alfred McAlpine plc Restricted Share
Plan ( the Restricted Share Plan'), both of which are performance-related. The ESOS 2000 replaced the Alfred McAlpine Executive Share Option Scheme
(1991) ( the ESOS 1991'), under which a number of options are still outstanding, the final grant having been made in April 2000. 
The Group also operates an all-employee share scheme, the Alfred McAlpine Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1998, further details of which may 
be found in note 21 on page 50.
There are no plans to grant discretionary options to Executive Directors who receive awards under the Restricted Share Plan. 
The Restricted Share Plan
The Restricted Share Plan was approved by shareholders on 22nd May, 1996 and no initial awards may be made after the tenth anniversary of its
adoption. Restricted Share Plan awards are subject to performance conditions intended to link participants' interests with those of the shareholders by
encouraging an increase in the total shareholder return ( TSR') of the Group relative to a peer group of companies and also in the long-term earnings 
per share ( EPS') of the Group.
The Committee believes that TSR and EPS are appropriate performance measurements, being two key long-term indicators of a company's success. 
It is the current intention of the Committee that these performance measurements continue to apply.
Awards made under the terms of the Restricted Share Plan represent a conditional right to receive ordinary shares in the Company, provided that the
Company achieves specific performance criteria and the participant remains in the Group's employment. The maximum value (based on market value 
at date of award) of shares over which an initial award may be made to a participant in any year may not exceed 50% of salary. Typically, initial awards
are made each year following the preliminary announcement of the full-year results. Initial awards may be made at other times, when the Committee
believes them to be justified.
The performance criterion currently used to determine the vesting of the initial awards is TSR, which is calculated by taking the percentage increase 
in the average mid-market ordinary share price of the Company for the three-year period from the date of award, plus the value of the reinvested
dividends. The Company's performance is then measured against that of a peer group of companies, the majority of which are direct competitors. 
As shown below, the peer group was amended following the sale of the Homes business on 1st October, 2001.
Original comparator companies (to 2001):
AMEC p.l.c. Costain Group PLC Montpellier Group Plc Taylor Woodrow plc
Beazer Group Plc* Interserve Plc Morrison Construction Group plc* Wainhomes*
Birse Group plc Kier Group plc Persimmon plc Westbury plc
Bryant Group plc* John Laing plc Speedy Hire plc George Wimpey PLC
* Beazer Group Plc, Bryant Group plc, Morrison Construction Group plc and Wainhomes were all taken over after the start of the performance periods for the Restricted Share Plan
awards. Wainhomes is not included as a comparator company for awards made after 1999. 
Current comparator companies (2002 onwards):
Amey plc* Birse Group plc Interserve Plc MITIE Group PLC 
W S Atkins plc Costain Group PLC Jarvis plc Morgan Sindall plc
Balfour Beatty plc Galliford Try plc Kier Group plc Serco Group plc
* Amey plc ceased to be listed on the London Stock Exchange on 26th June, 2003, following its acquisition by Ferrovial Servicios SA. 
Vesting may take place from the third anniversary of the initial award date. No awards vest if the Company's performance is below the 50th percentile.
Vesting starts at the 50th percentile, and 100% of the initial award can vest at the 40th percentile. Vesting is on a straight-line basis between the 50th and
the 40th percentile. If the Company's performance exceeds the 40th percentile, the number of shares represented by the award increases on a proportionate
basis, so that at the 1st percentile 150% of the number of shares under the initial award may vest. These additional rights are known as exceptional
performance awards. The rules allow for re-testing between the third and seventh anniversaries of the initial award date. Vesting may be deferred for a
further period of three years in the Alfred McAlpine Employee Benefit Trust (the Employee Benefit Trust). At the end of this deferral period, the deferred
awards may be matched on a one-for-one basis subject to satisfaction of a further performance target. This second performance target requires the growth
in EPS of the Company to exceed the growth in RPI by 9% or more over the three-year deferral period.
The Trustee of the Employee Benefit Trust has waived its entitlement to dividends. Where a participant has elected to defer vesting, the Company makes
discretionary cash payments to the participant, which are equivalent to the dividends that would normally be payable on the number of shares
corresponding to the award.

 ESOS 2000' Executive Share Option Scheme
Senior executives are granted discretionary options over ordinary shares in the Company, at the market price prevailing at the date of grant. The
performance condition for the ESOS 2000 requires the Company's earnings per share growth to exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index (RPI) by
not less than 3% per annum over a rolling three-year period in order for the options to be exercised. The Committee believes that this performance
condition is appropriate and sufficiently demanding.
Directors' Service Agreements and Contracts
When appointing new Executive Directors, the Committee considers it appropriate to offer a one-year service agreement. When Mr Grice assumed his
new role as Group Chief Executive, the Committee considered it appropriate to offer him an initial two-year service agreement, reducing to a rolling
one-year agreement on 10th August, 2004. Details of the Executive Directors' service agreements are set out below:
Effective date Unexpired Notice period Notice period
Executive Directors of contract term by Company by Director
I M Grice 10/08/03 17 months 17 months 12 months
P V Carolan 11/03/04 12 months 12 months 12 months
D Lavelle 30/10/03 12 months 12 months 12 months
M D Swan 01/05/02 12 months 12 months 12 months
The service agreements for the Executive Directors contain a provision allowing either party to terminate the agreement with immediate effect during
the period of 90 days following a change of control of the Company, whereupon a predetermined amount shall be payable to the Director. There are
no other provisions for compensation on early termination. Mr Grice, Mr Carolan, Mr Lavelle and Mr Swan each have a retirement age of 62.
Brief details of the contracts between the Company and the Non-Executive Directors are set out below. There are no provisions for compensation on
early termination of these contracts.

Trustees Limited, based in the Channel Islands. As at 31st December, 2003 the Trust held 2,450,340 ordinary shares in the Company. As potential
beneficiaries, the Executive Directors are each deemed to have a beneficial interest in all of the shares held in the Trust.

the Restricted Share Plan.

future benefit accrual. In common with other members of that plan, the Directors continue to retain the link to pensionable salary at their eventual date
of leaving in respect of service accrued up to 31st July, 2003, subject to appropriate Inland Revenue limits.

The values of accrued pension in columns (6) and (7) have been calculated in accordance with version 9.0 of guidance note GN 11 issued by the actuarial profession.
The value of the net increase in column (4) represents the incremental value to the Director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption that service terminated at the year
end. It is based on the accrued pension increase in column (2) and allows for the deduction of the Director's contribution.
The change in the value of accrued pension in column (5) includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and Directors, such as
stock market movements. It is calculated after deducting the Director's contribution.
Voluntary contributions paid by Directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
Increases in Mr Hume's pension are stated as at the date of his resignation as a Director.
