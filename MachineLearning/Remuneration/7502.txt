Remuneration report
The auditable part of the remuneration report is set out on pages 22 to 23.
INFORMATION NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT
Membership and Constitution of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, comprising the independent non-executive directors (Mr C D Collins, Mr R E Hough and Mr P H Swatman),
makes recommendations to the Board on the Company's overall framework for the remuneration of executive directors and certain key senior
executives, and also determines their individual remuneration packages (including pension rights and compensation payments). The Committee
consults the group chief executive on the remuneration of the executive directors and senior executives, and is assisted by the group company
secretary. Inbucon Limited acts as advisor to the Committee and also, when required, to the Company in respect of executive remuneration and
share schemes. Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited advises the Company on pension matters. Inbucon and Mercer do not provide
other services to the Group and neither the Committee nor the Company is aware of any conflict of interest.
Compliance
The Committee is constituted and operates in accordance with the provisions of Section B of The Combined Code on Corporate Governance
( the Code') issued by the Financial Reporting Council. In preparing this report the Board has complied with the provisions of the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and the Code.
Executive Remuneration Policy and Structure
The Group's aim is to provide remuneration packages that are sufficient to attract, motivate and retain executive directors of a high calibre. 
To this end, surveys and external advice are instrumental in the annual review of salary and benefits packages. The Committee believes that
base salary and benefits for executive directors should represent a fair return for employment, but that the total reward for executive directors
should be derived substantially from the performance-related elements of the remuneration package (annual bonus and awards of shares
under a long-term incentive plan). The current policy adopted by the Committee is that executive directors' base pay should be around the
median and that incentives may bring their total remuneration to the upper quartile.
Performance-related elements form a significant proportion of the executive directors' total remuneration packages, aligning their interests 
with those of the shareholders and providing incentives for performance. In designing schemes for performance-related remuneration, the
Committee follows the provisions of the Code. Due consideration is given to performance relative to comparable companies.
There have been no amendments to the terms and conditions of any entitlement of a director under the long-term incentive scheme
(the Restricted Share Plan) during the year.
Performance Chart
The chart below compares the growth in value of  100 invested in ordinary shares in Alfred McAlpine plc on 1 January 2000 with the
performance of a similar investment in the shares of the constituents of the FTSE Construction and Building Materials Index and the FTSE
Support Services Index. The directors are of the view that these constitute a relevant broad equity market index.
Basic Salary
The salary of each executive director is determined by the Committee, taking into account his personal performance and the prevailing rates in
the employment market for executives of comparable status, responsibility, skill and position in other companies. When determining directors'
salaries the Committee is always sensitive to pay and employment conditions throughout the Group. Independent remuneration surveys are
commissioned when required to substantiate salary levels. The most recent surveys show that the basic salaries of the executive directors are
currently slightly below the median when compared with their peers.
Annual Bonus
The Committee reviews the targets for the executive directors annually. For 2004 and 2005, bonuses for the executive directors are based on
growth in the Group's profit before tax and amortisation ( PBTA') prior to exceptional charges and, if the director is responsible for a business
stream, performance against budget for that business. The maximum bonus achievable is 100% of salary, which would require 20% growth
over prior year in Group PBTA. The bonus payable may be reduced if broader key performance indicators are not met. This is relevant,
stretching and designed to enhance the business. 
Pensions Policy
The Alfred McAlpine Pension Plan ( the Pension Plan') was closed to new entrants on 31 July 2003. Members of this final salary Pension Plan as
at that date retain the link to pensionable salary at their eventual date of leaving in respect of service up to 31 July 2003, but have ceased to
accrue benefits within the Pension Plan in respect of service after 31 July 2003. During 2004, the Group contributed  4.0m (2003:  5.2m) to
the Pension Plan, and it will continue to make an annual, index-linked contribution of this amount. 
The Company also operates the McAlpine 2003 Pension Plan ( the 2003 Pension Plan'), which is a contracted-in defined contribution pension
arrangement. The 2003 Pension Plan is operated on behalf of the Company by Zurich Corporate Pensions (as successor to Eagle Star) and is
subject to the Stakeholder Pensions regulations. The minimum employee contribution is 3% of basic salary which is matched by the Company.
Employees may elect to pay additional contributions, some of which will be matched by the Company, thus increasing the Company
contribution to 6% or 9% depending on the grade of the employee. For executive directors, the Company contribution can be up to 21% if
the director contributes 9%.

Alfred McAlpine plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2004
Remuneration report | continued
The average Company contribution equates to 5.63% of basic salary, amounting to  2.5m during 2004 (2003:  0.8m for the five month
period). Life assurance cover of four times basic salary is provided to members of the 2003 Pension Plan, whilst in service with the Group.
Dependants' pensions are provided on a member's death in service or in retirement. In addition, former members of the final salary Pension
Plan are currently provided with a further life assurance cover of two times basic salary, on death in service, which must be used to provide 
a dependant's pension.
All pension benefits are subject to Inland Revenue limits. It is the Group's policy to provide those executives who joined the Company after 
May 1989, and who are subject to the earnings cap ( 102,000 in the 2004/05 tax year), with appropriate pension benefits outside the pension
arrangements outlined above in relation to that part of their salary which exceeds the cap. The means of providing pension benefits for such
executives in the future will be reviewed when details of the proposed regulatory changes are confirmed. Executive directors retire at age 62.
The Remuneration Committee takes into consideration the impact of basic salary increases upon pension and associated employment costs.
Share Schemes
The Company currently operates the Alfred McAlpine Executive Share Option Scheme 2000 ( the ESOS 2000') and the Alfred McAlpine plc
Restricted Share Plan ( the Restricted Share Plan'), both of which are performance-related. The ESOS 2000 replaced the Alfred McAlpine
Executive Share Option Scheme (1991) ( the ESOS 1991'), under which a number of options are still outstanding, the final grant having been
made in April 2000. 
The most recent initial awards under the Restricted Share Plan were made on 22 April 2004, and the Company does not intend to make any
further initial awards under this Plan. Proposals for a new long-term incentive plan will be submitted to shareholders at the AGM in June 2005.
At the same time, the Company will also seek approval for a new executive share option scheme to replace the ESOS 2000, which has reached
the end of its five-year life.
The Group also operates an all-employee share scheme, the Alfred McAlpine Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1998, further details of
which may be found in note 21 on page 46. At the AGM in 2000, shareholders approved a share incentive plan to be known as the Alfred
McAlpine plc Partnership Share Scheme 2000, implementation of which is currently under consideration.
There are no plans to grant discretionary options to executive directors who receive awards under either the Restricted Share Plan or the
proposed new long-term incentive plan. 
The Restricted Share Plan
The Restricted Share Plan was approved by shareholders on 22 May 1996 and no initial awards may be made after the tenth anniversary of 
its adoption. Restricted Share Plan awards are subject to performance conditions intended to link participants' interests with those of the
shareholders by encouraging an increase in the total shareholder return ( TSR') of the Group relative to a peer group of companies and also 
in the long-term earnings per share ( EPS') of the Group.
The Committee believes that TSR and EPS are appropriate performance measurements, being two key long-term indicators of a company's
success. It is the current intention of the Committee that these performance measurements continue to apply to the Plan.
Awards made under the terms of the Restricted Share Plan represent a conditional right to receive ordinary shares in the Company, provided
that the Company achieves specific performance criteria and the participant remains in the Group's employment. The maximum value (based
on market value at date of award) of shares over which an initial award may be made to a participant in any year may not exceed 50% of
salary. Typically, initial awards have been made each year following the preliminary announcement of the full-year results. However, initial
awards have been made at other times, when the Committee believed them to be justified.
The performance criterion currently used to determine the vesting of the initial awards is TSR, which is calculated by taking the percentage
increase in the average mid-market ordinary share price of the Company for the three-year restricted period from the date of award, plus the
value of the reinvested dividends. The Company's performance is then measured against that of a peer group of companies, the majority of
which are direct competitors. As shown below, the peer group was amended following the sale of the Homes business on 1 October 2001.
Original comparator group (to 2001):
AMEC plc Costain Group plc Montpellier Group plc Taylor Woodrow plc
Beazer Group plc* Interserve plc Morrison Construction Group plc* Wainhomes*
Birse Group plc Kier Group plc Persimmon plc Westbury plc
Bryant Group plc* John Laing plc Speedy Hire plc George Wimpey plc
*Beazer Group plc, Bryant Group plc, Morrison Construction Group plc and Wainhomes were all taken over after the start of the performance periods for the Restricted Share Plan awards.
Wainhomes is not included as a comparator company for awards made after 1999. 
Amended comparator group (2002 onwards):
Amey plc* Birse Group plc Interserve plc MITIE Group plc 
W S Atkins plc Costain Group plc Jarvis plc Morgan Sindall plc
Balfour Beatty plc Galliford Try plc Kier Group plc Serco Group plc
*Amey plc ceased to be listed on the London Stock Exchange on 26 June 2003, following its acquisition by Ferrovial Servicios SA. 
Vesting may take place from the third anniversary of the initial award date. No awards vest if the Company's performance is below the 50th
percentile. Vesting starts at the 50th percentile, and 100% of the initial award can vest at the 40th percentile. Vesting is on a straight-line basis
between the 50th and the 40th percentile. If the Company's performance exceeds the 40th percentile, the number of shares represented by the
award increases on a proportionate basis, so that at the 1st percentile 150% of the number of shares under the initial award may vest. These
additional rights are known as exceptional performance awards. The rules allow for re-testing between the third and seventh anniversaries of the
initial award date. Vesting may be deferred for a further period of three years in the Alfred McAlpine Employee Benefit Trust (the Employee Benefit
Trust). At the end of this deferral period, the deferred award may be matched on a one-for-one basis subject to satisfaction of a further
performance target. This second performance target requires the growth in EPS of the Company to exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index
( RPI') by 9% or more over the three-year deferral period.

Alfred McAlpine plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2004
Remuneration report | continued
The trustee of the Employee Benefit Trust has waived its entitlement to dividends. Where a participant has elected to defer vesting, the 
Company makes discretionary cash payments to the participant, which are equivalent to the dividends that would normally be payable on the
number of shares corresponding to the deferred award.
ESOS 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme
Senior executives are granted discretionary options over ordinary shares in the Company, at the market price prevailing at the date of grant.
The performance condition for the ESOS 2000 requires the Company's EPS growth to exceed the growth in RPI by not less than 3% per annum
over a rolling three-year period in order for the options to be exercised. No further options will be granted under this scheme.
Directors' Service Agreements and Contracts
When appointing new executive directors, the Committee considers it appropriate to offer a one-year service agreement. When Mr Grice
became group chief executive in August 2003, the Committee considered it appropriate to offer him an initial two-year service agreement,
which reduced to a rolling one-year agreement on 10 August 2004. Details of the executive directors' service agreements are set out below:
Effective date Unexpired Notice period Notice period
Executive directors of contract term by Company by director
I M Grice 10/08/03 12 months 12 months 12 months
D Lavelle 30/10/03 12 months 12 months 12 months
C M McGilvray 17/03/05 12 months 12 months 12 months
M D Swan 01/05/02 12 months 12 months 12 months
The service agreements for the executive directors contain a provision allowing either party to terminate the agreement with immediate effect
during the period of 90 days following a change of control of the Company, whereupon a predetermined amount shall be payable to the
director. There are no other provisions for compensation on early termination. Each of the executive directors has a retirement age of 62.
Brief details of the contracts between the Company and the non-executive directors are set out below. There are no provisions for
compensation on early termination of these contracts.

provided to the other non-executive directors.
Directors' Interests
Directors and all senior executives are encouraged to accumulate a shareholding broadly equivalent to one year's salary and to retain their
shares after exercising share options or after vesting under the Restricted Share Plan, subject to the need to fund the acquisition of the shares
and any associated tax and national insurance liability.
The beneficial interests of the directors and their immediate families in the share capital of the Company at 31 December 2004 were 
as follows:

(i) Mr Carolan's interests are shown as at the date of his appointment on 11 March 2004 and as at 31 December 2004.
The Alfred McAlpine Employee Benefit Trust was established in 1998 and may benefit employees, including the executive directors, of the
Group. The trust is able to subscribe for or purchase shares to fulfil obligations under any of the Company's share schemes. The trustee is
Mourant and Co Trustees Limited, based in the Channel Islands. As at 31 December 2004 the trust held 2,136,098 ordinary shares in the
Company. As potential beneficiaries, the executive directors are each deemed to have a beneficial interest in all of the shares held in the trust.
There has been one change in directors' interests between the year end (31 December 2004) and 23 March 2005. On 6 January 2005, 
Mr G O Whitehead exercised an option over 120,000 ordinary shares that was due to expire in April 2005, and immediately sold all of the
resultant shares on the open market at a price of 306p per share, giving rise to a gain on exercise of  190,800.
At the date of his appointment, Mr C M McGilvray's interest in shares in the Company comprised 90,380 ordinary shares and 38,467 initial
awards under the Restricted Share Plan.

(i) Neither Mr Lavelle nor Mr Swan has a FURBS. The Company makes a supplementary payment to each of them, enabling them to make their own provision for pension in
respect of salary above the earnings cap. 
(ii) Mr Carolan was appointed on 11 March 2004. Mr Carolan's pension benefits are provided under the Alfred McAlpine Utility Services Group Limited Retirement Benefits
Scheme, which is an occupational defined contribution pension scheme.
(iii) Mr Hume resigned as a director on 30 October 2003. In mitigation of Mr Hume's contractual entitlement to two years' notice under the terms of his service agreement
dated 1 October 1998, the Committee agreed it was appropriate to continue payment of salary and benefits to Mr Hume on a month by month basis. Between 
1 September 2004 and 31 December 2004 no salary payments were made to Mr Hume, who was in receipt of short-term consultancy income from elsewhere. If, prior 
to 30 October 2005, Mr Hume commences alternative employment that is comparable with his former position with the Company, the Company will make a lump sum
payment to Mr Hume equivalent (after an adjustment to offset remuneration earned by Mr Hume since 1 November 2003) to 50% of the salary and benefits then
outstanding under his notice period. Included in taxable benefits for Mr Hume is the sum of  11,366 in respect of 9,190 shares released upon vesting of an award under
the Restricted Share Plan. The date of release for these shares was 11 May 2004, when the market price of a share was 301p.
Directors' Pension Arrangements for the Year Ended 31 December 2004
With effect from 31 July 2003, when it closed for future benefit accrual, the directors ceased to accrue defined benefit pensions within the
Alfred McAlpine final salary plan. In common with other members of that plan, the directors continue to retain the link to pensionable salary 
at their eventual date of leaving in respect of service accrued up to 31 July 2003, subject to appropriate Inland Revenue limits.

The values of accrued pension in columns (6) and (7) have been calculated in accordance with version 8.1 of guidance note GN 11 issued by the actuarial profession.
The value of the net increase in column (4) represents the incremental value to the director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption that service terminated
at the year end. It is based on the accrued pension increase in column (2) and allows for the deduction of the director's contribution.
The change in the value of accrued pension in column (5) includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and
directors, such as stock market movements. It is calculated after deducting the director's contribution.
Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
