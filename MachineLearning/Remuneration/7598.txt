 Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Alizyme plc  46
This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 concerning disclosure of directors'
remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002. The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors' remuneration. As required by the Regulations,
Resolution 6 to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements of the Company will be
approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company's members on the  auditable part' of the Directors' remuneration report and to state whether in their
opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations). The report has therefore
been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises John Gordon (Chairman), Sir Brian Richards, William Edge and Richard Forrest. The main responsibilities of the Remuneration
Committee are to make recommendations to the Board on the Company's policy on remuneration and to make recommendations on the specific remuneration,
benefits and terms of employment of the Chief Executive Officer and other executive Directors. The fees paid to the non-executive Directors are determined annually,
by the Board.
Policy on Director remuneration
In forming the Group's policy on remuneration the Board has given, and will continue to give, full consideration to Schedule A of the Combined Code appended to the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, that sets out the guidelines for dealing with the design of performance-related remuneration.
The Board's policy has been designed to ensure that Directors should receive appropriate incentive and reward given their performance, responsibility and
experience. In determining this, the Board has regard to:
  ensuring that the Group's remuneration policy attracts, retains and motivates directors of the quality required for the continued business, while avoiding
remunerating those directors more than is necessary;
  ensuring that Directors' remuneration is consistent with the compensation of directors holding comparable positions in other companies, but being aware of the
relative performances of those companies;
  ensuring that the Company's policy is sensitive to the salary and employment terms across the Group, especially when determining annual salary increases; and
  ensuring that the policy aligns the interests of Directors with those of the shareholders.
Remuneration package
Directors' remuneration packages are considered annually and comprise a number of elements. Packages are reviewed towards the end of each financial year.
Before packages are finally decided upon for the following year, the Chairman of the Board undertakes an appraisal of each of the executive Directors against their
objectives for the year and considers the contribution of each individual to the Group. The Remuneration Committee considers these appraisals when making their
recommendations to the Board of Directors.
The remuneration package of Directors comprises:
(i) Basic salary
Basic salaries are reviewed annually on 1 January. The review process is undertaken having regard to the development of the Group and the contribution that
individuals will continue to make. Consideration is also given to the need to retain and motivate individuals and information on the salary levels in comparable
organisations. In this respect the Remuneration Committee draws on the findings of a number of external salary surveys and undertakes its own research.
(ii) Annual performance incentive
Directors are awarded an annual bonus, at the discretion of and as recommended to the Board by the Remuneration Committee. Bonus awards are reviewed at the
end of the financial year and based upon the Group's overall performance together with individual achievements against objectives that are set at the beginning of
the year. Those objectives are intended to deliver excellence and align individual achievements with the Board's strategy for the Group and shareholder interests. The
awards are limited to a maximum of 50% of basic salary for executive Directors.
(iii) Pensions and other benefits
The Group does not operate a Group pension scheme. Instead the Group makes contributions representing 20% of the basic salary of Directors, to their individual
private pension arrangements. Other benefits provided are life assurance, permanent health insurance and private medical insurance. No company car is provided.
Instead, the Group contributes 10% of the basic salary towards the cost of executive Directors running their own cars. The cost of car fuel is also provided.

(iv) Share options
The Group operates a number of share option schemes that enable Directors to participate in the success of and growth in the share price of the Company. Options
are granted for either nine or ten years and may only be exercised in certain circumstances. Options cannot be exercised unless the share price of the Company's
ordinary shares have increased by a percentage greater than the percentage increase in the FTSE All-Share Index over a period ending on the third anniversary of the
date of grant of the option or any longer period not exceeding the expiry date of the options. The FTSE All-Share Index has been selected as it represents, for this
purpose, the performance index against which both shareholder return and Company performance can be measured. The grant of share options to Directors is at the
discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Total shareholder return
Total shareholder return looks at the value at 31 December 2004, of  100 invested in the Company on 1 January 2000 compared with the value of  100 invested in
the FTSE All-Share Index over the same period.
The FTSE All-Share Index has been chosen as a comparator as this is a performance index against which both shareholder return across a wide selection of
companies and the Company's own performance can be measured.
Terms of appointment
Service contracts for the executive Directors can be terminated by either party giving twelve months' written notice. Non-executive Directors do not have service
contracts. The non-executive Directors who served throughout the year have letters of appointment under which their services can be terminated by either party
giving three months' notice. In the case of William Edge and Richard Forrest, their services may be terminated by either party giving one month's written notice.
Upon the termination of employment of any of the Directors or employees, the Group's policy is to minimise its financial exposure while adhering to all of its
contractual obligations.

No share options were exercised during the year.
As disclosed in previous years, the non-executive Directors hold shares in the Company. Certain non-executive Directors also hold options to subscribe for shares in
the Company. The Board considered that, prior to flotation in 1996, the grant of options was necessary to attract and retain a high calibre of non-executive Director. It
is satisfied that all the non-executive Directors exercise independent judgement and are independent of management.
(i) Alizyme plc Unapproved Share Option Scheme.
This scheme runs in parallel with the Alizyme Limited Unapproved Share Option Scheme, such that a participant who exercises options granted under either one of
these schemes may not exercise options granted under the other. These two schemes were established with the intention of rewarding participants in the event the
Company was floated or the business was disposed of. No further options will be granted under these schemes.

Scheme and The Alizyme plc 2001 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme are subject to an exercise condition. Options cannot be exercised unless the share
price of the Company's ordinary shares has increased by a percentage greater than the percentage increase in the FTSE All-Share Index over a period ending on the
third anniversary of the date of grant of the option (Earliest date exercisable) or any longer period not exceeding the expiry date of the options.

AIM to the Official List on 19 October 2000.

This amendment provided that the options would now lapse on the ninth anniversary of the date of grant (as now shown in the table above under  Expiry date'),
