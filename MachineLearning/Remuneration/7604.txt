 Annual Report & Accounts 2006 Alizyme plc 44
This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the Regulations ) concerning disclosure
of directors' remuneration. The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has
applied the Combined Code relating to Directors' remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual
General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements of the Company will be presented for approval.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company's members on the auditable part of the Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion that
part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations). The report has therefore been divided
into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises John Gordon (Chairman), Sir Brian Richards, William Edge and Richard Forrest. The main responsibilities of the Remuneration
Committee are to make recommendations to the Board on the Company's policy on remuneration and to make decisions on the specific remuneration, benefits and
terms of employment of the Chief Executive Officer and other Executive Directors. The fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors are decided annually by the Board.
Policy on Director remuneration
In forming the Group's policy on remuneration the Board has given, and will continue to give, full consideration to Schedule A of the Combined Code appended to the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, which sets out the guidelines for dealing with the design of performance-related remuneration.
The Board's policy has been designed to ensure that Directors should receive appropriate incentive and reward given their performance, responsibility and
experience. In determining this, the Board has regard to:
  ensuring that the Group's remuneration policy attracts, retains and motivates Directors of the quality required for the continued business, while avoiding
remunerating those Directors more than is necessary;
  ensuring that Directors' remuneration is consistent with the compensation of directors holding comparable positions in other companies, but being aware of the
relative performances of those companies;
  ensuring that the Company's policy is sensitive to the salary and employment terms across the Group, especially when determining annual salary increases; and
  ensuring that the policy aligns the interests of Directors with those of the shareholders.
Remuneration package
Executive Directors' remuneration packages are considered annually and comprise a number of elements. Packages are reviewed towards the end of each financial
year. Before packages are finally decided upon for the following year, each of the Executive Directors undergoes an annual formal performance appraisal, with the
Chief Executive Officer and with the Chairman, against their objectives for the year. The Chief Executive Officer is appraised solely by the Chairman. The
Remuneration Committee considers these appraisals when making their decisions.
The remuneration package of Executive Directors comprises:
(i) Basic salary
Basic salaries are reviewed annually on 1 January. The review process is undertaken having regard to the development of the Group and the contribution that
individuals will continue to make. Consideration is also given to the need to retain and motivate individuals and information on the salary levels in comparable
organisations. In this respect the Remuneration Committee draws on the findings of a number of external salary surveys and undertakes its own research and, in this
light, will decide salary increases that it deems appropriate.
(ii) Annual performance incentive
Executive Directors are awarded an annual bonus, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Bonus awards are reviewed at the end of the financial year. The
award is based upon the achievement of the individual's personal objectives, which will include strategic objectives for the Group, that are set at the beginning of the
year. Those objectives are intended to deliver excellence and align individual achievements with the Board's strategy for the Group and shareholders' interests. The
awards are limited to a maximum of 50% of basic salary for Executive Directors.
(iii) Pensions and other benefits
The Group does not operate a group pension scheme. Instead the Group makes contributions representing 20% of the basic salary of Executive Directors to their
individual private pension arrangements. Other benefits provided are private medical insurance, life assurance and permanent health insurance. No company car is
provided. Instead, the Group contributes 10% of the basic salary towards the cost of Executive Directors running their own cars. The cost of car fuel is also provided.

For the year ended 31 December 2006 Annual Report & Accounts 2006 Alizyme plc 45
(iv) Share options
The Group operates a number of share option schemes that enable Executive Directors to participate in the success of and growth in the share price of the
Company. Options are granted for ten years and may only be exercised in certain circumstances. Options cannot be exercised unless the share price of the
Company's ordinary shares have increased by a percentage greater than the percentage increase in the FTSE All-Share Index over any single period commencing
always on the date of grant of the option, and ending not earlier than the third anniversary of the date of grant of the option and not later than the expiry date of the
option. In a biopharmaceutical development company, key events such as clinical results or licensing deals are the culmination of a very long process and are the major
influence on the performance of the Company's share price. The market reacts to these key periodic events either positively or negatively and this is reflected in the
share price. The ability to test from any time after three years and before ten years following the date of grant of the option reflects the long-term nature of the business
and the binary nature of such events on share price performance. The Board believes that such performance conditions of exercise align Directors' interests directly
with those of shareholders and reflect the long-term strategy of the Company for building shareholder value within the environment of the biopharmaceutical sector.
The FTSE All-Share Index has been chosen as a comparator as this is a performance index against which both shareholder return across a wide selection of
companies and the Company's own performance can be measured.
The grant of share options to Executive Directors is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Maximum individual limits that apply to the schemes are
described in this Remuneration Report on page 47.
The Board recognises that concerns have been expressed by institutional shareholders regarding the performance criteria for the exercise of share options and the
ability for re-testing of these performance conditions beyond the initial three year vesting period up to the tenth anniversary of the date of grant of an option. The
Remuneration Committee is unable to amend the terms of options already granted, however, at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, to be held at 11.00 a.m. on
15 June 2007, the Company will seek the approval of shareholders to implement new incentive arrangements involving an approved share option scheme and long
term incentive plan in which these concerns are addressed. The terms of these new incentive arrangements have been discussed with major shareholders and are
explained in detail in the covering letter to the Notice of Annual General Meeting. In the event of shareholder approval of the proposed new incentive arrangements,
no further options will be granted under the existing share option schemes.
Total shareholder return
Total shareholder return looks at the value at 31 December 2006 of  100 invested in the Company on 31 December 2001 compared with the value of  100 invested in
the FTSE All-Share Index over the same period.
Terms of appointment
Service contracts for the Executive Directors can be terminated by either party giving twelve months' written notice. Non-Executive Directors do not have service
contracts. The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment under which their services can be terminated by either party giving written notice of three
months, in the case of Sir Brian Richards and John Gordon, and one month, in the case of William Edge and Richard Forrest. All service contracts and letters of
appointment of Directors who have served during the year are available for inspection at the Company's registered office and will be available for inspection 15
minutes prior to and during the Annual General Meeting of the Company, to be held at the offices of Buchanan Communications Limited, 45 Moorfields, London, EC2Y
9AE at 11.00 a.m. on 15 June 2007.
