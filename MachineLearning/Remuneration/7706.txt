 Directors' remuneration report
Alkane Energy plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2003 25
Scope of report
The Directors' Remuneration Report sets out the Company's remuneration policy and, particularly, its approach for directors. It also
explains how the Company applies the principles of good corporate governance in relation to directors' remuneration as defined
in the Combined Code, and explains any areas of non-compliance. This report has been prepared by the Remuneration
Committee (the  Committee') and has been approved by the Board for submission to shareholders. The Board accepted the
Committee's report without change. 
Shareholders will be provided with an opportunity to vote on remuneration policy as set out in this report at the forthcoming
Annual General Meeting. Further details will be contained in the Notice of AGM on pages 54 to 55 of this document.
Composition and role of the committee
The Committee is made up entirely of independent non-executive directors, currently Sir David White (Chairman) and Lord
Fraser. Their biographical details appear on page 16.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference and meets as required, but at least twice a year, to:
  Make recommendations to the Board on the broad policy and framework for executive directors' remuneration and its cost;
and
  Determine the total remuneration package and contractual terms for each of the executive directors.
It is also responsible for overseeing the management and administration of the Group's share schemes for employees, including
the award of share option entitlements.
The members of the Committee do not have any personal financial interests, other than as shareholders, or any conflicts from
cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in the running of the Group.
The Committee has access to independent external advisers on all remuneration-related issues and obtains advice in
determining individual remuneration levels from remuneration consultants, The Remuneration Practice. The Remuneration
Practice was appointed by the Committee. The results of market surveys and other analysis from external sources are also made
available to the Committee. When appropriate the Committee invites the views of the Chairman, the Chief Executive and the
Finance Director, but they are not involved in discussions concerning their own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
In October 2001, the Remuneration Committee commissioned an independent report by The Remuneration Practice to review
the remuneration of the directors of the Company, the objective being to establish a transparent framework covering all
elements of remuneration. The Committee accepted the findings of the report and brought the salary and benefits package of
the executive directors in line with its recommendations.
The Committee has adopted a remuneration policy designed to:
  Attract, retain and motivate the high calibre professional, managerial and technological expertise necessary to realise the
Group's business objectives without paying excessively;
  Ensure that the remuneration framework and the constituent reward elements are competitive and fairly reflect, as
necessary, the nature and complexity of the Group's business and the markets within which the Group operates;
  In general terms, set base salary broadly in line with median market practice, whilst achieving higher earnings by linking
cash incentive packages (e.g. bonuses) and share options to superior performance;
  Create overall remuneration packages in which performance-related elements form a significant proportion; and
  Maintain the correct balance and linkage between individual and business performance so as to effectively align the
interests of directors and senior management with those of shareholders, particularly that of enhancing shareholder value.
Elements of remuneration 
Each executive director's remuneration package consists of the following elements:
  Basic salary and benefits;
  Benefits in kind;
  Performance-related annual bonus;
  Pensions and life assurance arrangements; and
  Share options and long-term incentives.
Full details of the directors' remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2003 are set out on pages 28 to 29.
Basic salary 
Basic salary for each executive director is reviewed annually taking into account assessments of the overall company
performance, the director's personal performance, experience and changing responsibilities and the median market position (against
businesses of similar size and complexity). Account is also taken of salary levels and employment conditions across the Group. Directors' remuneration report continued
Alkane Energy plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2003 26
Benefits in kind
Other corporate benefits play a role in ensuring the competitiveness of overall remuneration arrangements. The most significant
benefits agreed by the Committee are car allowance (where there are ceilings on expenditure) and the provision of insurance
policies providing cover for health care. In addition, the Company pays certain motoring and accommodation expenses for Dr
Cameron Davies and David Cross. The benefits are valued in accordance with Inland Revenue rules.
Performance-related annual bonus 
Due to the current transitional stage of the Company there is no performance-related annual bonus scheme in place at present.
Bonuses are not pensionable. No executive director received a bonus payment with respect to performance for the financial
year ended 31 December 2003 (2002: Nil).
Pensions and life assurance 
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Pension contributions for executive directors are based on salary
only, with bonuses and other discretionary benefits excluded. For the financial year under review, the Company contributed 10
per cent of basic salary (2002: 10 per cent). Non-executive directors are ineligible to join the Company's pension scheme.
Share options and long term incentives
(i) Post Admission Share Option Plan
The Company operates a share option scheme (the  Post Admission Share Option Plan' or the  Plan') for the executive
directors and employees. For all options granted, the option price is determined by reference to the market value at the
date of grant and all personnel are required to pay the full grant price on exercise.
Options granted under the Plan are exercisable between three and ten years from the award. The operation of the Plan is
subject to ongoing review by the Remuneration Committee with regards to the level of allocation and frequency of issue of
options taking into account the practice of comparable companies and the guidelines of the Association of Business
Insurers. Where necessary, the Committee will take independent advice. In addition, if new shares are issued for the
purposes of the Plan, institutional investors' guidelines on dilution of equity in connection with share schemes will continue
to be complied with. 
The Committee determines the requirement, if any, for performance targets each time options are granted. No options
granted to date have been subject to a performance target. 
No options under the Plan have either been exercised by or awarded to executive directors during the year (2002: Nil).
(ii) 2000 Share Option Plan
This Plan was established by the Company in 2000 for all directors and employees. A maximum of one third of the options
granted under the Plan became immediately exercisable on the Company's flotation on the London Stock Exchange on 14
December 2000 and the remainder may be exercised by option holders from the third anniversary of the grant up to the
tenth anniversary of the grant. Share options granted under this Plan have no performance criteria because at the time of
establishment of the Plan the Company was not listed and therefore was not subject to the provisions of the Combined
Code. No future options may be granted under this Plan.
iii) Individual option arrangements
In addition to the above plans, options were previously granted to certain executive directors under the following bespoke
unapproved share option arrangements. Share options granted under these agreements have no performance criteria
because at the time of the grant of the share options the Company was not listed and therefore was not subject to the
provisions of the Combined Code:
  30 October 1997 Deed: Dr Cameron Davies and David Oldham were granted options to subscribe for 142,800 and
154,200 ordinary shares of 0.5 pence each respectively. The options became exercisable from 14 December 2000 and
there is no date upon which the options lapse; and
  7 November 2000 Deed: David Cross was granted an option to acquire 1,200,000 ordinary shares of 0.5 pence each.
The option became exercisable from 14 December 2000 and lapses on 13 December 2005.
(iv) Savings Related Share Option Scheme
During 2002 the Company introduced a Savings Related Share Option Scheme, (the  Sharesave' or  SAYE' Scheme). This
Scheme was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2002 and is approved by the Inland Revenue. The
executive directors may participate in the Sharesave Scheme on equal eligibility terms with all employees. Participants may
save between  5 and  250 per month, through payroll deduction for a period of three or five years, after which time they
can acquire shares at a discount of up to 20 per cent (set at the time of invitation) of the market value. The Scheme is
designed to provide a long-term savings and investment opportunity. It is intended that this Scheme will be offered on a
regular basis. Directors' remuneration report continued

(v) Long-term incentives
There are currently no long-term incentive plans in place. 
Further details of the executive directors' interests in share options are set out on page 30.
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors were appointed for an initial period of two years. Re-appointment beyond a second term or
subsequent term is subject to consideration by the Nomination Committee for recommendation to the Board. Fees are
determined by the Board based on independent advice and a review of the fees paid by other companies of similar size and
complexity, and reflect the amount of time non-executive directors are expected to devote to the Group's activities during the
year. No additional fees are paid to non-executive directors who chair Committees of the Board. Individual directors are not
involved in any discussion concerning their own remuneration. Non-executive directors do not have service contracts and no
benefits are payable on termination.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for pensions, share incentives, annual bonus or any similar payments other than out-of-
pocket expenses in connection with the performance of their duties.
Service contracts and notice periods
The executive directors have service contracts with the Company, which are not of fixed duration and which are terminable in
each case by either party giving 12 months' written notice. The service agreements allow the Company to terminate the
employment of an executive director without notice by making a payment in lieu of notice calculated to compensate the
executive directors for salary and contractual benefits over the unexpired period of notice although the Company is not obliged
to exercise its right to make a payment in lieu of notice. Directors' service agreements provide notice periods of 12 months in
line with the recommendations of the Combined Code. Copies of service contracts are available for inspection prior to and
during the Annual General Meeting.
The non-executive directors, including Sir David White who is proposed for re-appointment at the Annual General Meeting, do
not have service contracts with the Company.
The details of the executive directors' individual service contracts are set out below:
Date of Unexpired term at Notice Period
Executive director service contract 31 December 2003
David Cross 6 December 2000 N/A 12 months
Dr Cameron Davies 6 December 2000 N/A 12 months
Stephen Goalby 6 December 2000 N/A 12 months
David Oldham 6 December 2000 N/A 12 months
External appointments
The Committee recognises that executive directors may be invited to take up non-executive directorships or public
appointments and believes the Group can benefit from such external appointments. Accordingly, subject to Board approval,
executive directors may accept such appointments providing this is not likely to lead to a conflict of interest with the Company's
activities and the wider exposure gained will be beneficial to the development of the individual.
