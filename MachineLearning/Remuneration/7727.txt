directors' remuneration report
Scope of report
The Directors' Remuneration Report sets out the Company's remuneration policy and, particularly, its approach for
directors. It also explains how the Company applies the principles of good corporate governance in relation to directors'
remuneration as defined in the revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance, known as the 2003 FRC Code 
(the Code ). This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee (the  Committee') and has been approved
by the Board for submission to shareholders. The Board accepted the Committee's report without change. 
Shareholders will be provided with an opportunity to vote on remuneration policy as set out in this report at the forthcoming
Annual General Meeting. Further details will be contained in the Notice of AGM on pages 50 to 51 of this document.
Composition and role of the committee
The Committee is made up entirely of non-executive directors, currently John Lander (Chairman) and Lord Fraser. Their
biographical details appear on page 12.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference and meets as required, but at least twice a year, to:
  Make recommendations to the Board on the broad policy and framework for executive directors' remuneration and
its cost; and
  Determine the total remuneration package and contractual terms for each of the executive directors.
It is also responsible for overseeing the management and administration of the Group's share schemes for employees,
including the award of share option entitlements.
The members of the Committee do not have any personal financial interests, other than as shareholders, or any
conflicts from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in the running of the Group.
The Committee has access to independent external advisers on all remuneration-related issues and obtains advice in
determining individual remuneration levels from remuneration consultants appointed by the Committee. The results of
market surveys and other analysis from external sources are also made available to the Committee. When appropriate
the Committee invites the views of the Chief Executive and the Finance Director, but they are not involved in discussions
concerning their own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The Committee has adopted a remuneration policy designed to:
  Attract, retain and motivate the high calibre professional, managerial and technological expertise necessary to
realise the Group's business objectives without paying excessively;
  Ensure that the remuneration framework and the constituent reward elements are competitive and fairly reflect, as
necessary, the nature and complexity of the Group's business and the markets within which the Group operates;
  In general terms, set base salary broadly in line with median market practice, whilst achieving higher earnings by
linking cash incentive packages (e.g. bonuses) and share options to superior performance;
  Create overall remuneration packages in which performance-related elements form a significant proportion; and
  Maintain the correct balance and linkage between individual and business performance so as to effectively align 
the interests of directors and senior management with those of shareholders, particularly that of enhancing
shareholder value.
Elements of remuneration 
Each executive director's remuneration package consists of the following elements:
  Basic salary and benefits;
  Benefits in kind;
  Performance-related annual bonus;
  Pensions and life assurance arrangements; and
  Share options and long-term incentives.
Full details of the directors' remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2004 are set out on pages 24 to 25.
Basic salary 
Basic salary for each executive director is reviewed annually taking into account assessments of the overall company
performance, the director's personal performance, experience and changing responsibilities and the median market
position (against businesses of similar size and complexity). Account is also taken of salary levels and employment
conditions across the Group.
Benefits in kind
Other corporate benefits play a role in ensuring the competitiveness of overall remuneration arrangements. The most
significant benefits agreed by the Committee are car allowance (where there are ceilings on expenditure) and the
provision of insurance policies providing cover for health care. In addition, the Company pays certain motoring and
accommodation expenses for Dr Cameron Davies. The benefits are valued in accordance with Inland Revenue rules. 22

Performance-related annual bonus 
There is no performance-related annual bonus scheme in place at present. Bonuses are not pensionable. No executive
director received a bonus payment with respect to performance for the financial year ended 31 December 2004 
(2003: Nil).
Pensions and life assurance 
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Pension contributions for executive directors are based on
salary only, with bonuses and other discretionary benefits excluded. For the financial year under review, the Company
contributed 10 per cent of basic salary (2003: 10 per cent). Non-executive directors are ineligible to join the Company's
pension scheme.
Share options and long term incentives
(i) Post Admission Share Option Plan
The Company operates a share option scheme (the  Post Admission Share Option Plan' or the  Plan') for the
executive directors and employees. For all options granted, the option price is determined by reference to the
market value at the date of grant and all personnel are required to pay the full grant price on exercise.
Options granted under the Plan are exercisable between three and ten years from the award. The operation of the
Plan is subject to ongoing review by the Remuneration Committee with regards to the level of allocation and
frequency of issue of options taking into account the practice of comparable companies and the guidelines of the
Association of Business Insurers. Where necessary, the Committee will take independent advice. In addition, if new
shares are issued for the purposes of the Plan, institutional investors' guidelines on dilution of equity in connection
with share schemes will continue to be complied with. 
The Committee determines the requirement, if any, for performance targets each time options are granted. No
options granted to date have been subject to a performance target, but in order to comply more fully with best
practice the Committee will require that targets be set for future grants of options to executive directors.
No options under the Plan have either been exercised by or awarded to executive directors during the year 
(2003: Nil).
(ii) 2000 Share Option Plan
This Plan was established by the Company in 2000 for all executive directors and employees. A maximum of one
third of the options granted under the Plan became immediately exercisable on the Company's flotation on the
London Stock Exchange on 14 December 2000 and the remainder may be exercised by option holders from the
third anniversary of the grant up to the tenth anniversary of the grant. Share options granted under this Plan have
no performance criteria because at the time of establishment of the Plan the Company was not listed and therefore
was not subject to the provisions of the Code. No future options may be granted under this Plan.
(iii) Individual option arrangements
In addition to the above plans, options were previously granted to certain executive directors under the following
bespoke unapproved share option arrangements. Share options granted under these agreements have no performance
criteria because at the time of the grant of the share options the Company was not listed and therefore was not
subject to the provisions of the Code:
  30 October 1997 Deed: Dr Cameron Davies and David Oldham were granted options to subscribe for 142,800
and 154,200 ordinary shares of 0.5 pence each respectively. The options became exercisable from 14 December
2000 and lapse on 13 December 2010; and
  7 November 2000 Deed: An option to acquire 1,200,000 ordinary shares of 0.5 pence each was granted to
David Cross. The option became exercisable from 14 December 2000 and lapses on 13 December 2005. 
David Cross resigned as a director on 4 June 2004; this did not affect his rights in respect of the Deed.
(iv) Savings Related Share Option Scheme
During 2002 the Company introduced a Savings Related Share Option Scheme, (the  Sharesave' or  SAYE' Scheme).
This Scheme was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2002 and is approved by the Inland
Revenue. The executive directors may participate in the Sharesave Scheme on equal eligibility terms with all employees.
Participants may save between  5 and  250 per month, through payroll deduction for a period of three or five years,
after which time they can acquire shares at a discount of up to 20 per cent (set at the time of invitation) of the
market value. The Scheme is designed to provide a long-term savings and investment opportunity.
(v) Long-term incentives
There are currently no long-term incentive plans in place. 
Further details of the executive directors' interests in share options are set out on page 26. 23

Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors were appointed for an initial period of two years. Re-appointment beyond a second term or
subsequent term is subject to consideration by the Nomination Committee for recommendation to the Board. John Lander
was appointed on 4 June 2004. Lord Fraser was first appointed on 19 February 2001, and has been re-appointed by the
Board for a third term of two years commencing on 19 February 2005. Fees are determined by the Board based on
independent advice and a review of the fees paid by other companies of similar size and complexity, and reflect the
amount of time non-executive directors are expected to devote to the Group's activities during the year. No additional
fees are paid to non-executive directors who chair Committees of the Board. Individual directors are not involved in any
discussion concerning their own remuneration. Non-executive directors do not have service contracts and no benefits
are payable on termination.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for pensions, share incentives, annual bonus or any similar payments other than
out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the performance of their duties.
Service contracts and notice periods
The executive directors have service contracts with the Company, which are not of fixed duration and which are terminable
in each case by either party giving 12 months' written notice. The service agreements allow the Company to terminate
the employment of an executive director without notice by making a payment in lieu of notice calculated to compensate
the executive directors for salary and contractual benefits over the unexpired period of notice although the Company is
not obliged to exercise its right to make a payment in lieu of notice. Directors' service agreements provide notice periods
of 12 months in line with the recommendations of the Code. Copies of service contracts are available for inspection prior
to and during the Annual General Meeting.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts with the Company.
The details of the executive directors' individual service contracts are set out below:
Date of Unexpired term at Notice Period
Executive director service contract 31 December 2004
Dr Cameron Davies 6 December 2000 N/A 12 months
Stephen Goalby 6 December 2000 N/A 12 months
David Oldham 6 December 2000 N/A 12 months
External appointments
The Committee recognises that executive directors may be invited to take up non-executive directorships or public
appointments and believes the Group can benefit from such external appointments. Accordingly, subject to Board
approval, executive directors may accept such appointments providing this is not likely to lead to a conflict of interest
with the Company's activities and the wider exposure gained will be beneficial to the development of the individual.
