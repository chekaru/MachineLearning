Directors' Remuneration Report
Directors' Remuneration Report
Scope of report
The Directors' Remuneration Report sets out the Company's 
remuneration policy and, particularly, its approach for directors. 
It also explains how the Company intends to comply with 
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance to the extent 
practicable for a public company of its size which followed 
the recommendations on corporate governance of the Quoted 
Companies Alliance (the  Code'). This report has been prepared 
by the Remuneration Committee (the  Committee') and has 
been approved by the Board for submission to shareholders. 
The Board accepted the Committee's report without change. 
Shareholders will be provided with an opportunity to vote on 
remuneration policy as set out in this report at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting. Further details are contained in the 
Notice of Annual General Meeting on pages 58 to 59 of 
this document.
Composition and role of the Committee
The Committee is made up entirely of non-executive directors, 
currently John Lander (Chairman) and Lord Fraser. Their 
biographical details appear on page 20.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference and 
meets as required, but at least twice a year, to:
  Make recommendations to the Board on the broad policy 
and framework for executive directors' remuneration and its 
cost; and
  Determine the total remuneration package and contractual 
terms for each of the executive directors.
It is also responsible for overseeing the management and 
administration of the Group's share schemes for employees, 
including the award of share option entitlements.
The members of the Committee do not have any personal 
financial interests, other than as shareholders, or any conflicts 
from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in the 
running of the Group.
The Committee has access to independent external advisers 
on all remuneration-related issues and obtains advice in 
determining individual remuneration levels from remuneration 
consultants appointed by the Committee. The results of 
market surveys and other analysis from external sources are 
also made available to the Committee. When appropriate 
the Committee invites the views of the Chief Executive and 
the Finance Director, but they are not involved in discussions 
concerning their own remuneration.
The Committee met on two occasions in 2005.
Remuneration policy
The Committee has adopted a remuneration policy designed to:
  Attract, retain and motivate the high calibre professional, 
managerial and technological expertise necessary to realise 
the Group's business objectives without paying excessively;
  Ensure that the remuneration framework and the 
 constituent reward elements are competitive and fairly 
reflect, as necessary, the nature and complexity of the 
Group's business and the markets within which the Group 
operates;
  In general terms, set base salary broadly in line with median 
market practice, whilst achieving higher earnings by linking 
cash incentive packages (e.g. bonuses) and share options to 
superior performance;
  Create overall remuneration packages in which performance-
related elements form a significant proportion; and
  Maintain the correct balance and linkage between individual 
and business performance so as to effectively align the 
interests of directors and senior management with those 
of shareholders, particularly that of enhancing shareholder 
value.
Elements of remuneration
Each executive director's remuneration package consists of the 
following elements:
  Basic salary and benefits;
  Benefits in kind;
  Performance-related annual bonus;
  Pensions and life assurance arrangements; and
  Share options and long-term incentives.
Full details of the directors' remuneration for the year ended 31 
December 2005 are set out on pages 32 to 33.
Basic salary
Basic salary for each executive director is reviewed annually 
taking into account assessments of the overall company 
performance, the director's personal performance, experience 
and changing responsibilities and the median market position 
(against businesses of similar size and complexity). Account is 
also taken of salary levels and employment conditions across 
the Group.
Benefits in kind
Other corporate benefits play a role in ensuring the 
competitiveness of overall remuneration arrangements. 
The most significant benefits agreed by the Committee 
are car allowance (where there are ceilings on expenditure) and 
the provision of insurance policies providing cover for health 
care. In addition, the Company pays certain motoring and 
accommodation expenses for Dr Cameron Davies. The benefits 
are valued in accordance with Inland Revenue rules.
Performance-related annual bonus
There is no performance-related annual bonus scheme in place 
at present. Bonuses are not pensionable. No executive director 
received a bonus payment with respect to performance for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2005 (2004: Nil). 30 Alkane Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005
Pensions and life assurance
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. 
Pension contributions for executive directors are based on 
salary only, with bonuses and other discretionary benefits 
excluded. For the financial year under review, the Company 
contributed 10 per cent of basic salary (2004: 10 per cent). 
Non-executive directors are ineligible to join the Company's 
pension scheme.
Share options and long-term incentives
(a) Post Admission Share Option Plan
The Company operates a share option scheme (the  Post 
Admission Share Option Plan' or the  Plan') for the executive 
directors and employees. For all options granted, the option 
price is determined by reference to the market value at the date 
of grant and all personnel are required to pay the full grant price 
on exercise.
Options granted under the Plan are exercisable between 
three and ten years from the award. The operation of the Plan 
is subject to ongoing review by the Remuneration Committee 
with regards to the level of allocation and frequency of issue 
of options taking into account the practice of comparable 
companies and the guidelines of the Association of 
Business Insurers. Where necessary, the Committee will take 
independent advice. In addition, if new shares are issued for 
the purposes of the Plan, institutional investors' guidelines 
on dilution of equity in connection with share schemes will 
continue to be complied with. 
The Committee determines the requirement, if any, for 
performance targets each time options are granted. In order 
to comply with best practice the Committee has required that 
targets be set for all grants of options to executive directors 
from 1 January 2005.
Options under the Plan were granted on 8 April 2005 to Dr 
Cameron Davies (over 100,000 shares), Stephen Goalby 
(over 300,000 shares) and David Oldham (over 100,000 shares). 
Performance targets were set in respect of these grants. 
No options under the Plan have been exercised by executive 
directors during the year (2004: Nil). 
(b) 2000 Share Option Plan
This Plan was established by the Company in 2000 for all 
executive directors and employees. A maximum of one third 
of the options granted under the Plan became immediately 
exercisable on the Company's flotation on the London Stock 
Exchange on 14 December 2000 and the remainder may be 
exercised by option holders from the third anniversary of the 
grant up to the tenth anniversary of the grant. Share options 
granted under this Plan have no performance criteria because 
at the time of establishment of the Plan the Company was not 
listed and therefore was not subject to the provisions of the 
Code. No future options may be granted under this Plan.
(c) Individual option arrangement
In addition to the above plans, options were previously granted 
to certain executive directors under a bespoke unapproved 
share option arrangement, executed under a Deed dated 30 
October 1997. Under this Deed Dr Cameron Davies and David 
Oldham were granted options to subscribe for 142,800 and 
154,200 ordinary shares of 0.5 pence each respectively. The 
options became exercisable from 14 December 2000 and lapse 
on 13 December 2010. Share options granted under this Deed 
have no performance criteria because at the time of the grant 
of the share options the Company was not listed and therefore 
was not subject to the provisions of the Code. 
(d) Savings Related Share Option Scheme
During 2002 the Company introduced a Savings Related Share 
Option Scheme, (the  Sharesave' or  SAYE' Scheme). This 
Scheme was approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting in 2002 and is approved by the Inland Revenue. The 
executive directors may participate in the Sharesave Scheme 
on equal eligibility terms with all employees. Participants 
may save between  5 and  250 per month, through payroll 
deduction for a period of three or five years, after which time 
they can acquire shares at a discount of up to 20 per cent 
(set at the time of invitation) of the market value. The Scheme 
is designed to provide a long-term savings and investment 
opportunity.
(e) Long-term incentives
There are currently no long-term incentive plans in place. 
Further details of the executive directors' interests in share 
options are set out on page 34.
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors were appointed for an initial 
period of two years. Re-appointment beyond a second term or 
subsequent term is subject to consideration by the Nomination 
Committee for recommendation to the Board. John Lander was 
appointed on 4 June 2004. Lord Fraser was first appointed on 
19 February 2001, and has been reappointed by the Board for a 
third term of two years commencing on 19 February 2005. Fees 
are determined by the Board based on independent advice and 
a review of the fees paid by other companies of similar size 
and complexity, and reflect the amount of time non-executive 
directors are expected to devote to the Group's activities during 
the year. No additional fees are paid to non-executive directors 
who chair Committees of the Board. Individual directors are not 
involved in any discussion concerning their own remuneration. 
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts, there is 
no notice period in respect of their appointment, and no 
benefits are payable on termination.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for pensions, share 
incentives, annual bonus or any similar payments other than 
out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the performance 
of their duties.

Service contracts and notice periods
The executive directors have service contracts with the 
Company, which are not of fixed duration and which are 
terminable in each case by either party giving 12 months' 
written notice. The service agreements allow the Company 
to terminate the employment of an executive director without 
notice by making a payment in lieu of notice calculated 
to compensate the executive directors for salary and 
contractual benefits over the unexpired period of notice 
although the Company is not obliged to exercise its right 
to make a payment in lieu of notice. Directors' service 
agreements provide notice periods of 12 months in line 
with the recommendations of the Code. Copies of service 
contracts are available for inspection prior to and during the 
Annual General Meeting. 
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts with 
the Company.
The details of the executive directors' individual service 
contracts are set out below:
External appointments
The Committee recognises that executive directors may 
be invited to take up non-executive directorships or public 
appointments and believes the Group can benefit from such 
external appointments. Accordingly, subject to Board approval, 
executive directors may accept such appointments providing 
that this is not likely to lead to a conflict of interest with the 
Company's activities and that the wider exposure gained will 
be beneficial to the development of the individual.
Performance review
The graph below illustrates the total shareholder return 
(TSR) performance of Alkane Energy plc compared to the FTSE 
AIM Index over the previous three year period to 31 December 
2005. TSR is defined as share price growth plus dividends paid. 
The index has been selected as it is a  broad equity market 
index' of which Alkane Energy plc is a constituent company.
