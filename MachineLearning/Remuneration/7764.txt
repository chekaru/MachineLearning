 25 Directors' Remuneration Report
Scope of report
The Directors' Remuneration Report sets out the Company's 
remuneration policy and, particularly, its approach for 
directors. It also explains how the Company intends to 
comply with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
to the extent practicable for a public company of its 
size which followed the recommendation on corporate 
governance of the Quoted Companies Alliance. This report 
has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee (the 
 Committee') and has been approved by the Board for 
submission to shareholders. The Board accepted the 
Committee's report without change. 
Shareholders will be provided with an opportunity to vote 
on remuneration policy as set out in this report at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Further details are 
contained in the Notice of Annual General Meeting on 
pages 57 to 58 of this document.
Composition and role of the Committee
The Committee is made up entirely of non-executive 
directors, currently John Lander (Chairman) and Lord Fraser. 
Their biographical details appear on page 16.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference 
and meets as required, but at least twice a year, to:
  Make recommendations to the Board on the broad policy 
and framework for executive directors' remuneration and 
its cost; and
  Determine the total remuneration package and contractual 
terms for each of the executive directors.
It is also responsible for overseeing the management and 
administration of the Group's share schemes for employees, 
including the award of share option entitlements.
The members of the Committee do not have any personal 
financial interests, other than as shareholders, or any 
conflicts from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement 
in the running of the Group.
The Committee has access to independent external 
advisers on all remuneration-related issues and obtains 
advice in determining individual remuneration levels from 
remuneration consultants appointed by the Committee. The 
results of market surveys and other analysis from external 
sources are also made available to the Committee. When 
appropriate the Committee invites the views of the Chief 
Executive and the Finance Director, but they are not involved 
in discussions concerning their own remuneration.
The Committee met on two occasions in 2006.
Remuneration policy
The Committee has adopted a remuneration policy designed 
to:
  Attract, retain and motivate the high calibre professional, 
managerial and technological expertise necessary to 
realise the Group's business objectives without paying 
excessively;
  Ensure that the remuneration framework and the   
constituent reward elements are competitive and fairly 
reflect, as necessary, the nature and complexity of the 
Group's business and the markets within which the   
Group operates;
  In general terms, set base salary broadly in line with 
median market practice, whilst achieving higher earnings 
by linking cash incentive packages (e.g. bonuses) and 
share options to superior performance;
  Create overall remuneration packages in which 
performance-related elements form a significant 
proportion; and
  Maintain the correct balance and linkage between 
individual and business performance so as to effectively 
align the interests of directors and senior management 
with those of shareholders, particularly that of enhancing 
shareholder value.
Elements of remuneration
Each executive director's remuneration package consists of 
the following elements:
  Basic salary and benefits;
  Benefits in kind;
  Performance-related annual bonus;
  Pensions and life assurance arrangements; and
  Share options and long-term incentives.
Full details of the directors' remuneration for the year ended 
31 December 2006 are set out on pages 28 to 29.
Basic salary
Basic salary for each executive director is reviewed 
annually taking into account assessments of the overall 
Company performance, the director's personal performance, 
experience and changing responsibilities and the median 
market position (against businesses of similar size and 
complexity). Account is also taken of salary levels and 
employment conditions across the Group.
Benefits in kind
Other corporate benefits play a role in ensuring the 
competitiveness of overall remuneration arrangements. The 
most significant benefits agreed by the Committee are car 
allowance (where there are ceilings on expenditure) and the 
provision of insurance policies providing cover for health 
care. In addition, the Company pays certain motoring and 
accommodation expenses for Dr Cameron Davies. The 
benefits are valued in accordance with Inland Revenue rules.

(Continued)
Performance-related annual bonus
There is no performance-related annual bonus scheme 
in place at present. Bonuses are not pensionable. No 
executive director received a bonus payment with respect to 
performance for the financial year ended 31 December 2006 
(2005: Nil). 
Pensions and life assurance
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. 
Pension contributions for executive directors are based on 
salary only, with bonuses and other discretionary benefits 
excluded. For the financial year under review, the Company 
contributed 10 per cent of basic salary (2005: 10 per cent). 
Non-executive directors are ineligible to join the Company's 
pension scheme.
Share options and long-term incentives
(a) Post Admission Share Option Plan
The Company operates a share option scheme (the  Post 
Admission Share Option Plan' or the  Plan') for the executive 
directors and employees. For all options granted, the option 
price is determined by reference to the market value at the 
date of grant and all personnel are required to pay the full 
grant price on exercise.
Options granted under the Plan are exercisable between 
three and ten years from the award. The operation 
of the Plan is subject to ongoing review by the 
Remuneration Committee with regards to the level of 
allocation and frequency of issue of options taking into 
account the practice of comparable companies and the 
guidelines of the Association of Business Insurers. Where 
necessary, the Committee will take independent advice. 
In addition, if new shares are issued for the purposes of the 
Plan, institutional investors' guidelines on dilution of equity
in connection with share schemes will continue to be 
complied with. 
The Committee determines the requirement, if any, for 
performance targets each time options are granted. In order 
to comply with best practice the Committee has required 
that targets be set for all grants of options to executive 
directors from 1 January 2005. The options granted on 8 
April 2005 to Dr Cameron Davies, Stephen Goalby and David 
Oldham under the Post Admission Share Option Plan were 
conditional upon the achievement of a target increase of 
5% in the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of the Company 
relative to that of AIM between 8th April 2005 and 31 
December 2006. This target was achieved.
No options under the Plan were granted to or exercised 
by executive directors during the year (2005: options granted 
to executive directors over 500,000 ordinary shares, 
exercised, nil). 
(b) 2000 Share Option Plan
This Plan was established by the Company in 2000 for all 
executive directors and employees. A maximum of one third 
of the options granted under the Plan became immediately 
exercisable on the Company's flotation on the London Stock 
Exchange on 14 December 2000 and the remainder may 
be exercised by option holders from the third anniversary 
of the grant up to the tenth anniversary of the grant. Share 
options granted under this Plan have no performance 
criteria because at the time of establishment of the Plan the 
Company was not listed. No future options may be granted 
under this Plan.
(c) Individual option arrangement
In addition to the above plans, options were previously 
granted to certain executive directors under a bespoke 
unapproved share option arrangement, executed under a 
Deed dated 30 October 1997. Under this Deed Dr Cameron 
Davies and David Oldham were granted options to subscribe 
for 142,800 and 154,200 ordinary shares of 0.5 pence each 
respectively. The options became exercisable from 14 
December 2000 and lapse on 13 December 2010. Share 
options granted under this Deed have no performance 
criteria because at the time of the grant of the share options 
the Company was not listed. 
(d) Savings Related Share Option Scheme
During 2002 the Company introduced a Savings Related 
Share Option Scheme, (the  Sharesave' or  SAYE' Scheme). 
This Scheme was approved by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting in 2002 and is approved by the Inland 
Revenue. The executive directors may participate in 
the Sharesave Scheme on equal eligibility terms with all 
employees. Participants may save between  5 and  250 
per month, through payroll deduction for a period of three 
or five years, after which time they can acquire shares at a 
discount of up to 20 per cent (set at the time of invitation) of 
the market value. The Scheme is designed to provide a long-
term savings and investment opportunity.
(e) Long-term incentives
There are currently no long-term incentive plans in place. 
Further details of the executive directors' interests in share 
options are set out on page 30.
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors were appointed for an initial 
period of two years. Re-appointment beyond a second 
term or subsequent term is subject to consideration by 
the Nomination Committee for recommendation to the 
Board. John Lander was appointed on 4 June 2004 and 
subsequently re-appointed for a further two years to 4 June 
2008. Lord Fraser was first appointed on 19 February 2001, 
and has been reappointed by the Board for a fourth term 
of two years commencing on 19 February 2007. Fees are 
determined by the Board based on independent advice and 
a review of the fees paid by other companies of similar size 
and complexity, and reflect the amount of time non-executive 
directors are expected to devote to the Group's activities 
during the year. No additional fees are paid to non-executive 
directors who chair Committees of the Board. Individual 
directors are not involved in any discussion concerning their 
Alkane Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Directors' Remuneration Report 2 own remuneration. Non-executive directors do not have 
service contracts, there is no notice period in respect of their 
appointment, and no benefits are payable on termination.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for pensions, share 
incentives, annual bonus or any similar payments other than 
out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the performance 
of their duties.
Service contracts and notice periods
The executive directors have service contracts with the 
Company, which are not of fixed duration and which are 
terminable in each case by either party giving 12 months' 
written notice. The service contracts allow the Company to 
terminate the employment of an executive director without 
notice by making a payment in lieu of notice calculated 
to compensate the executive directors for salary and 
contractual benefits over the unexpired period of notice 
although the Company is not obliged to exercise its right to 
make a payment in lieu of notice. Directors' service contracts 
provide notice periods of 12 months. Copies of service 
contracts are available for inspection prior to and during the 
Annual General Meeting.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts 
with the Company.
The details of the executive directors' individual service 
contracts are set out below:
External appointments
The Committee recognises that executive directors may 
be invited to take up non-executive directorships or public 
appointments and believes the Group can benefit from 
such external appointments. Accordingly, subject to Board 
approval, executive directors may accept such appointments 
providing that this is not likely to lead to a conflict of interest 
with the Company's activities and that the wider exposure 
gained will be beneficial to the development of the individual.
Performance review
The graph below illustrates the total shareholder return (TSR) 
performance of Alkane Energy plc compared to the FTSE 
AIM Index over the previous five year period to 31 December 
2006. TSR is defined as share price growth plus dividends

market index' of which Alkane Energy plc is a constituent 
company.
