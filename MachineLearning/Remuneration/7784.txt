DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION 
REPORT
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
Scope of report
The Directors' Remuneration Report sets out the Company's 
remuneration policy and, particularly, its approach for directors. 
It also explains how the Company intends to comply with 
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance to the extent 
practicable for a public company of its size which followed 
the recommendation on corporate governance of the Quoted 
Companies Alliance. This report has been prepared by the 
Remuneration Committee (the  Committee') and has been 
approved by the Board for submission to shareholders. The 
Board accepted the Committee's report without change. 
Shareholders will be provided with an opportunity to vote on 
remuneration policy as set out in this report at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting. Further details are contained in the 
Notice of Annual General Meeting on pages 78 to 82 of this 
document.
Composition and role of the committee
The Committee is made up entirely of non-executive directors, 
currently John Lander (Chairman), Lord Fraser and Julia 
Henderson. Their biographical details appear on page 12.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference and 
meets as required, but at least twice a year, to:
  Make recommendations to the Board on the broad policy 
and framework for executive directors' remuneration and 
its cost; and
  Determine the total remuneration package and contractual 
terms for each of the executive directors.
It is also responsible for overseeing the management and 
administration of the Group's share schemes for employees, 
including the award of share option entitlements.
The members of the Committee do not have any personal 
fi nancial interests, other than as shareholders, or any confl icts 
from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in the running 
of the Group.
The Committee has access to independent external advisers on 
all remuneration-related issues and obtains advice in determining 
individual remuneration levels from remuneration consultants 
appointed by the Committee. The results of market surveys and 
other analysis from external sources are also made available 
to the Committee. When appropriate the Committee invites 
the views of the Chief Executive and the Finance Director, 
but they are not involved in discussions concerning their own 
remuneration.
The Committee met on 2 occasions in 2007.
Remuneration policy
The Committee has adopted a remuneration policy designed to:
  Attract, retain and motivate the high calibre professional, 
managerial and technological expertise necessary to realise 
the Group's business objectives without paying excessively;
  Ensure that the remuneration framework and the constituent 
reward elements are competitive and fairly refl ect, as 
necessary, the nature and complexity of the Group's business 
and the markets within which the Group operates;
  In general terms, set base salary broadly in line with median 
market practice, whilst achieving higher earnings by linking 
cash incentive packages (e.g. bonuses) and share options to 
superior performance;
  Create overall remuneration packages in which performance-
related elements form a signifi cant proportion; and
  Maintain the correct balance and linkage between individual 
and business performance so as to effectively align the 
interests of directors and senior management with those of 
shareholders, particularly that of enhancing shareholder value.
Elements of remuneration
Each executive director's remuneration package consists of the 
following elements:
  Basic salary and benefi ts;
  Benefi ts in kind;
  Performance-related annual bonus;
  Pensions and life assurance arrangements; and
  Share options and long-term incentives.
Full details of the directors' remuneration for the year ended 31 
December 2007 are set out on pages 21 to 26.
Basic salary
Basic salary for each executive director is reviewed annually 
taking into account assessments of the overall Company 
performance, the director's personal performance, experience 
and changing responsibilities and the median market position 
(against businesses of similar size and complexity). Account is 
also taken of salary levels and employment conditions across 
the Group.
Benefi ts in kind
Other corporate benefi ts play a role in ensuring the 
competitiveness of overall remuneration arrangements. The most 
signifi cant benefi ts agreed by the Committee are car allowance 
(where there are ceilings on expenditure) and the provision of 
insurance policies providing cover for health care. In addition, the 
Company pays certain motoring and accommodation expenses 
for Dr Cameron Davies. The benefi ts are valued in accordance 
with Inland Revenue rules.

DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
(CONTINUED)
Performance-related annual bonus
There is no performance-related annual bonus scheme in place 
at present. Bonuses are not pensionable. No executive director 
received a bonus payment with respect to performance for the 
fi nancial year ended 31 December 2007 (2006: Nil).
Pensions and life assurance
The Group operates a defi ned contribution pension scheme. 
Pension contributions for executive directors are based on salary 
only, with bonuses and other discretionary benefi ts excluded. For 
the fi nancial year under review, the Company contributed 10 per 
cent of basic salary (2006: 10 per cent). Non-executive directors 
are ineligible to join the Company's pension scheme.
Share options and long term incentives
(i) Post Admission Share Option Plan
 The Company operates a share option scheme (the  Post 
Admission Share Option Plan' or the  Plan') for the executive 
directors and employees. For all options granted, the option 
price is determined by reference to the market value at the 
date of grant and all personnel are required to pay the full 
grant price on exercise.
 Options granted under the Plan are exercisable between three 
and ten years from the award. The operation of the Plan is 
subject to ongoing review by the Remuneration Committee 
with regards to the level of allocation and frequency of issue 
of options taking into account the practice of comparable 
companies and the guidelines of the Association of 
Business Insurers. Where necessary, the Committee will take 
independent advice. In addition, if new shares are issued for 
the purposes of the Plan, institutional investors' guidelines 
on dilution of equity in connection with share schemes will 
continue to be complied with. 
 The Committee determines the requirement, if any, for 
performance targets each time options are granted. In order 
to comply with best practice the Committee has required that 
targets be set for all grants of options to executive directors 
from 1 January 2005. The options granted on 8 April 2005 
to Dr Cameron Davies, Stephen Goalby and David Oldham 
under the Post Admission Share Option Plan were conditional 
upon the achievement of a target increase of 5% in the Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) of the Company relative to that of 
AIM between 8 April 2005 and 31 December 2006. This target 
was achieved.
 No options under the Plan were granted to or exercised by 
executive directors during the year (2006: Nil)
(ii) 2000 Share Option Plan
 This Plan was established by the Company in 2000 for all 
executive directors and employees. A maximum of one third 
of the options granted under the Plan became immediately 
exercisable on the Company's fl otation on the London Stock 
Exchange on 14 December 2000 and the remainder may be 
exercised by option holders from the third anniversary of the 
grant up to the tenth anniversary of the grant. Share options 
granted under this Plan have no performance criteria because 
at the time of establishment of the Plan the Company was not 
listed. No future options may be granted under this Plan.
(iii) Individual option arrangement
 In addition to the above plans, options were previously granted 
to certain executive directors under a bespoke unapproved 
share option arrangement, executed under a Deed dated 30 
October 1997. Under this Deed Dr Cameron Davies and David 
Oldham were granted options to subscribe for 142,800 and 
154,200 ordinary shares of 0.5 pence each respectively. The 
options became exercisable from 14 December 2000 and 
lapse on 13 December 2010. Share options granted under this 
Deed have no performance criteria because at the time of the 
grant of the share options the Company was not listed. 
(iv) Savings Related Share Option Scheme
 During 2002 the Company introduced a Savings Related Share 
Option Scheme, (the  Sharesave' or  SAYE' Scheme). This 
Scheme was approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting in 2002 and is approved by the Inland Revenue. The 
executive directors may participate in the Sharesave Scheme 
on equal eligibility terms with all employees. Participants 
may save between  5 and  250 per month, through payroll 
deduction for a period of three or fi ve years, after which time 
they can acquire shares at a discount of up to 20 per cent 
(set at the time of invitation) of the market value. The Scheme 
is designed to provide a long-term savings and investment 
opportunity.
(v) Long-term incentives
 There are currently no long-term incentive plans in place. 
Further details of the executive directors' interests in share 
options are set out on page 26.

DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION 
REPORT
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors were appointed for an initial period
of two years. Re-appointment beyond a second term or 
subsequent term is subject to consideration by the Nomination 
Committee for recommendation to the Board. John Lander 
was appointed on 4 June 2004 and subsequently re-appointed 
for a further two years to 4 June 2008. Lord Fraser was fi rst 
appointed on 19 February 2001, and has been re-appointed by 
the Board for a fourth term of two years commencing on 
9 February 2007. Julia Henderson was appointed on 1 June 2007. 
Fees are determined by the Board based on independent advice 
and a review of the fees paid by other companies of similar size 
and complexity, and refl ect the amount of time non-executive 
directors are expected to devote to the Group's activities during 
the year. No additional fees are paid to non-executive directors 
who chair Committees of the Board. Individual directors are not 
involved in any discussion concerning their own remuneration. 
There is no notice period in respect of non-executive directors' 
appointment, and no benefi ts are payable to them on termination 
of appointment.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for pensions, share 
incentives, annual bonus or any similar payments other than 
out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the performance of 
their duties.
Service contracts and notice periods
The executive directors have service contracts with the Company, 
which are not of fi xed duration and which are terminable in each 
case by either party giving 12 months' written notice. The service 
contracts allow the Company to terminate the employment of 
an executive director without notice by making a payment in 
lieu of notice calculated to compensate the executive directors 
for salary and contractual benefi ts over the unexpired period of 
notice although the Company is not obliged to exercise its right 
to make a payment in lieu of notice. Directors' service contracts 
provide notice periods of 12 months. Copies of service contracts 
are available for inspection prior to and during the Annual General 
Meeting.
The details of the executive directors' individual service contracts 
are set out below:

External appointments
The Committee recognises that executive directors may 
be invited to take up non-executive directorships or public 
appointments and believes the Group can benefi t from such 
external appointments. Accordingly, subject to Board approval, 
executive directors may accept such appointments providing 
that this is not likely to lead to a confl ict of interest with the 
Company's activities and that the wider exposure gained will be 
benefi cial to the development of the individual.
Performance review
The graph below illustrates the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
performance of Alkane Energy plc compared to the FTSE AIM 
Index over the previous fi ve year period to 31 December 2007.
