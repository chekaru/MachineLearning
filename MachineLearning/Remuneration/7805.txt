Directors' Remuneration Report
Scope of report
The Directors' Remuneration Report sets out the Company's 
remuneration policy and, particularly, its approach for directors. 
It also explains how the Company intends to comply with the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance to the extent practicable 
for a public company of its size which followed the recommendation 
on corporate governance of the Quoted Companies Alliance. 
This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee 
(the  Committee') and has been approved by the Board for 
submission to shareholders. The Board accepted the Committee's 
report without change. 
Shareholders will be provided with an opportunity to vote on 
remuneration policy as set out in this report at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting. Further details are contained in the Notice 
of Annual General Meeting circulated to shareholders.
Composition and role of the committee
The Committee is made up entirely of non-executive directors, 
currently John Lander (Chairman), Lord Fraser and Julia Henderson. 
Their biographical details appear on page 14.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference and meets 
as required, but at least twice a year, to:
  Make recommendations to the Board on the broad policy 
and framework for executive directors' remuneration and its 
cost; and
  Determine the total remuneration package and contractual 
terms for each of the executive directors.
It is also responsible for overseeing the management and 
administration of the Group's share schemes for employees, 
including the award of share option entitlements.
The members of the Committee do not have any personal fi nancial 
interests, other than as shareholders, or any confl icts from 
cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in the running of 
the Group.
The Committee has access to independent external advisers on all 
remuneration-related issues and may obtain advice in determining 
individual remuneration levels from remuneration consultants 
appointed by the Committee. The results of market surveys and 
other analysis from external sources are also made available to the 
Committee. When appropriate the Committee invites the views of 
the Chief Executive Offi cer and the Finance Director, but they are not 
involved in discussions concerning their own remuneration.
The Committee met on two occasions in 2008.
Remuneration policy
The Committee has adopted a remuneration policy designed to:
  Attract, retain and motivate the high calibre professional, 
managerial and technological expertise necessary to realise the 
Group's business objectives without paying excessively;
  Ensure that the remuneration framework and the constituent 
reward elements are competitive and fairly refl ect, as necessary, 
the nature and complexity of the Group's business and the 
markets within which the Group operates;
  In general terms, set base salary broadly in line with median 
market practice, whilst achieving higher earnings by linking 
cash incentive packages (e.g. bonuses) and share options to 
superior performance;
  Create overall remuneration packages in which 
performance-related elements form a signifi cant proportion; and
  Maintain the correct balance and linkage between individual and 
business performance so as to effectively align the interests of 
directors and senior management with those of shareholders, 
particularly that of enhancing shareholder value.
Elements of remuneration
Each executive director's remuneration package consists of the 
following elements:
  Basic salary and benefi ts;
  Benefi ts in kind;
  Performance-related annual bonus;
  Pensions and life assurance arrangements; and
  Share options and long-term incentives.
Full details of the directors' remuneration for the year ended 
31 December 2008 are set out on pages 24 to 25.
Basic salary
Basic salary for each executive director is reviewed annually taking 
into account assessments of the overall Company performance, 
the director's personal performance, experience and changing 
responsibilities and the median market position (against businesses 
of similar size and complexity). Account is also taken of salary levels 
and employment conditions across the Group.
Benefi ts in kind
Other corporate benefi ts play a role in ensuring the competitiveness 
of overall remuneration arrangements. The most signifi cant benefi ts 
agreed by the Committee are car allowance (where there are ceilings 
on expenditure) and the provision of insurance policies providing 
cover for health care. In addition, the Company pays certain 
motoring and accommodation expenses for Cameron Davies and 
Neil O'Brien. The benefi ts are valued in accordance with Inland 
Revenue rules.
Performance-related annual bonus
There was no performance-related annual bonus scheme for the year 
to 31 December 2008. Bonuses are not pensionable. No executive 
director received a bonus payment with respect to performance for 
the fi nancial year ended 31 December 2008 (2007: Nil).
Annual Bonus Scheme 2009
The Company has in place a programme for signifi cant expansion 
for the year requiring the commitment and efforts of all staff. 
Recognising this effort the Committee and Board have approved a 
bonus scheme for all staff, including executive directors, based on 
the achievement of both increased profi t and increased production.
The maximum potential bonus payment available under the scheme 
for the year ending 31 December 2009 is 25%.
Discussions are in progress in respect of an additional bonus 
scheme for executive directors.
Pensions and life assurance
The Group operates a defi ned contribution pension scheme. Pension 
contributions for executive directors are based on salary only, with 
bonuses and other discretionary benefi ts excluded. For the fi nancial 
year under review, the Company contributed 10 per cent of basic 
salary (2007: 10 per cent). Non-executive directors are ineligible to 
join the Company's pension scheme.
Share options and long term incentives
(i) Post Admission Share Option Plan 
The Company operates a share option scheme (the  Post 
Admission Share Option Plan' or the  Plan') for the executive 
directors and employees. For all options granted, the option 
price is determined by reference to the market value at the date 
of grant and all personnel are required to pay the full grant price 
on exercise.

Alkane Energy plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
 Options granted under the Plan are exercisable between three 
and ten years from the award. The operation of the Plan is 
subject to ongoing review by the Committee with regards to 
the level of allocation and frequency of issue of options taking 
into account the practice of comparable companies and the 
guidelines of the Association of Business Insurers. Where 
necessary, the Committee will take independent advice. In 
addition, if new shares are issued for the purposes of the 
Plan, institutional investors' guidelines on dilution of equity 
in connection with share schemes will continue to be 
complied with. 
The Committee determines the requirement, if any, for 
performance targets each time options are granted. In order 
to comply with best practice the Committee has required that 
from 1 January 2005 targets be set for all grants of options to 
executive directors other than on appointment. The options 
granted on 8 April 2005 to Cameron Davies, Stephen Goalby and 
David Oldham under the Post Admission Share Option Plan were 
conditional upon the achievement of a target increase of 5% in 
the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of the Company relative to 
that of AIM between 8 April 2005 and 31 December 2006. This 
target was achieved.
No other options under the Plan were granted to or exercised 
by executive directors during the year (2007: Nil). 
On 3 November 2008 options over 2,000,000 ordinary shares 
of 0.5p each were granted to Neil O'Brien upon his appointment 
as Chief Executive Offi cer.
(ii) 2000 Share Option Plan
This Plan was established by the Company in 2000 for all 
executive directors and employees. A maximum of one third 
of the options granted under the Plan became immediately 
exercisable on the Company's fl otation on the London Stock 
Exchange on 14 December 2000 and the remainder may be 
exercised by option holders from the third anniversary of the 
grant up to the tenth anniversary of the grant. Share options 
granted under this Plan have no performance criteria because 
at the time of establishment of the Plan the Company was not 
listed. No future options may be granted under this Plan.
(iii) Individual option arrangement
In addition to the above plans, options were previously granted 
to certain executive directors under a bespoke unapproved 
share option arrangement, executed under a Deed dated 30 
October 1997. Under this Deed Cameron Davies and David 
Oldham were granted options to subscribe for 142,800 and 
154,200 ordinary shares of 0.5 pence each respectively. The 
options became exercisable from 14 December 2000 and lapse 
on 13 December 2010. Share options granted under this Deed 
have no performance criteria because at the time of the grant of 
the share options the Company was not listed. 
(iv) Savings Related Share Option Scheme
During 2002 the Company introduced a Savings Related Share 
Option Scheme, (the  Sharesave' or  SAYE' Scheme). This 
Scheme was approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting in 2002 and is approved by the Inland Revenue. The 
executive directors may participate in the Sharesave Scheme 
on equal eligibility terms with all employees. Participants may 
save between  5 and  250 per month, through payroll deduction 
for a period of three or fi ve years, after which time they can 
acquire shares at a discount of up to 20 per cent (set at the time 
of invitation) of the market value. The Scheme is designed to 
provide a long-term savings and investment opportunity.
(v) Long-term incentives
There are currently no long-term incentive plans in place. 
Further details of the executive directors' interests in share options 
are set out on page 26.
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors were appointed for an initial period of 
two years. Re-appointment beyond a second term or subsequent 
term is subject to consideration by the Nomination Committee for 
recommendation to the Board. John Lander was appointed on 
4 June 2004 and has been re-appointed for a third term commencing 
on 4 June 2008. Lord Fraser was fi rst appointed on 19 February 
2001, and has been re-appointed by the Board for a fourth term 
commencing on 9 February 2007. Lord Fraser will retire at the AGM 
and will not stand for re-election. Julia Henderson was appointed on 
1 June 2007. Fees are determined by the Board based on 
independent advice and a review of the fees paid by other 
companies of similar size and complexity, and refl ect the amount 
of time non-executive directors are expected to devote to the 
Group's activities during the year. No additional fees are paid to 
non-executive directors who chair Committees of the Board. 
Individual directors are not involved in any discussion concerning 
their own remuneration. There is no notice period in respect of 
non-executive directors' appointment, and no benefi ts are payable 
to them on termination of appointment.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for pensions, share 
incentives, annual bonus or any similar payments other than 
out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the performance 
of their duties.
Service contracts and notice periods
The executive directors have service contracts with the Company, 
which are not of fi xed duration and which are terminable in each 
case by either party giving 12 months' written notice. The service 
contracts allow the Company to terminate the employment of 
an executive director without notice by making a payment in lieu 
of notice calculated to compensate the executive directors for 
salary and contractual benefi ts over the unexpired period of notice 
although the Company is not obliged to exercise its right to make a 
payment in lieu of notice. Directors' service contracts provide notice 
periods of 12 months. Copies of service contracts are available for 
inspection prior to and during the Annual General Meeting.
The details of the executive directors' individual service contracts are 
set out below:

David Oldham 6 December 2000 N/A 12 months
External appointments
The Committee recognises that executive directors may be invited 
to take up non-executive directorships or public appointments and 
believes the Group can benefi t from such external appointments. 
Accordingly, subject to Board approval, executive directors may 
accept such appointments providing that this is not likely to lead 
to a confl ict of interest with the Company's activities and that the 
wider exposure gained will be benefi cial to the development of 
the individual.
