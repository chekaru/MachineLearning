Alkane Energy plc. Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Directors' Remuneration Report
Directors' Remuneration Report
Scope of Report
The Directors' Remuneration Report sets out the Company's 
remuneration policy and, particularly, its approach for Directors. It also 
explains how the Company complies with the Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance to the extent practicable for a public company 
of its size which follows the recommendation on corporate governance 
of the Quoted Companies Alliance. This Report has been prepared by 
the Remuneration Committee (the  Committee') and has been approved 
by the Board for submission to shareholders. The Board accepted the 
Committee's Report without change.
Shareholders will be provided with an opportunity to vote on 
remuneration policy as set out in this Report at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting. Further details are contained in the Notice of Annual 
General Meeting circulated to shareholders.
Composition and role of the Committee
The Committee is made up entirely of Non-Executive Directors, 
currently Joe Darby (Chairman), Julia Henderson and John Lander. 
Their biographical details appear on page 16.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference and meets as 
required, but at least twice a year, to:
  Make recommendations to the Board on the broad policy and 
framework for executive Directors' remuneration and its cost; and
  Determine the total remuneration package and contractual terms for 
each of the executive Directors.
It is also responsible for overseeing the management and administration 
of the Group's share schemes for employees, including the award of 
share option entitlements.
The members of the Committee do not have any personal fi nancial 
interests, other than as shareholders, or any confl icts from 
cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in the running of 
the Group.
The Committee has access to independent external advisers on all 
remuneration-related issues and may obtain advice in determining 
individual remuneration levels from remuneration consultants appointed 
by the Committee. The results of market surveys and other analysis 
from external sources are also made available to the Committee. When 
appropriate, the Committee invites the views of the Chief Executive 
Offi cer and the Finance Director, but they are not involved in discussions 
concerning their own remuneration.
The Committee met on one occasion in 2009.
Remuneration policy
The Committee has adopted a remuneration policy designed to:
  Attract, retain and motivate the high calibre professional, managerial 
and technological expertise necessary to realise the Group's business 
objectives without paying excessively;
  Ensure that the remuneration framework and the constituent reward 
elements are competitive and fairly refl ect, as necessary, the nature 
and complexity of the Group's business and the markets within which 
the Group operates;
  In general terms, set base salary broadly in line with median market 
practice, whilst achieving higher earnings by linking cash incentive 
packages (e.g. bonuses) and share options to superior performance;
  Create overall remuneration packages in which performance-related 
elements form a signifi cant proportion; and
  Maintain the correct balance and linkage between individual and 
business performance so as to effectively align the interests of 
Directors and senior management with those of shareholders, 
particularly that of enhancing shareholder value.
Elements of remuneration
Each executive Director's remuneration package consists of the following 
elements:
  Basic salary and benefi ts;
  Benefi ts in kind;
  Performance-related annual bonus;
  Pensions and life assurance arrangements; and
  Share options and long-term incentives.
Full details of the Directors' remuneration for the year ended 31 
December 2009 are set out on pages 26 to 27.
Basic salary
Basic salary for each executive Director is reviewed annually taking into 
account assessments of the overall Company performance, the Director's 
personal performance, experience and changing responsibilities and 
the median market position (against businesses of similar size and 
complexity). Account is also taken of salary levels and employment 
conditions across the Group.
Benefi ts in kind
Other corporate benefi ts play a role in ensuring the competitiveness 
of overall remuneration arrangements. The most signifi cant benefi ts 
agreed by the Committee are car allowance (where there are ceilings 
on expenditure) and the provision of insurance policies providing cover 
for health care. In addition, the Company pays certain motoring and 
accommodation expenses for Neil O'Brien. The Company paid motoring 
and accommodation expenses for Cameron Davies during 2009, during 
his employment as an executive Director. The benefi ts are valued in 
accordance with Inland Revenue rules.
Performance-related annual bonus
At the start of the year the Company introduced a performance related 
bonus scheme under which all staff, including executive Directors, 
were eligible for a maximum bonus of 25% of basic salary based on 
the achievement of both increased profi t and increased production. 
No payments to Directors have been approved by the Remuneration 
Committee in respect of the performance for the year to 31 December 
2009. There was no performance-related annual bonus scheme for the 
year to 31 December 2008. 
Recognising the continuing commitment and efforts being asked of 
staff in achieving the Company's challenging expansion programme, the 
Remuneration Committee has approved a bonus scheme for 2010 for all 
staff, including executive Directors, based on the achievement of Group 
budget profi t before tax; power output at least 5% above budget and 
operating costs per unit of output at least 5% below budget.
The maximum potential bonus payment available under the scheme for 
the year ending 31 December 2010 is 25% of basic salary.
Bonuses are not pensionable. 
Pensions and life assurance
The Group operates a defi ned contribution pension scheme. Pension 
contributions for executive Directors are based on salary only, with 
bonuses and other discretionary benefi ts excluded. For the fi nancial year 
under review, the Company contributed 10 per cent of basic salary (2008: 
10 per cent). Non-Executive Directors are ineligible to join the Company's 
pension scheme. 25

Share options and long term incentives
(i) Post Admission Share Option Plan
The Company operates a share option scheme (the  Post Admission 
Share Option Plan' or the  Plan') for the executive Directors and 
employees. For all options granted, the option price is determined by 
reference to the market value at the date of grant and all personnel 
are required to pay the full grant price on exercise.
 Options granted under the Plan are exercisable between three 
and ten years from the award. The operation of the Plan is subject 
to ongoing review by the Committee with regards to the level of 
allocation and frequency of issue of options taking into account 
the practice of comparable companies and the guidelines of the 
Association of Business Insurers. Where necessary, the Committee 
will take independent advice. In addition, if new shares are issued 
for the purposes of the Plan, institutional investors' guidelines on 
dilution of equity in connection with share schemes will continue to 
be complied with. 
 The Committee determines the requirement, if any, for performance 
targets each time options are granted. In order to comply with best 
practice targets are set for grants of options to executive Directors 
other than on appointment. The options granted on 8 April 2005 to 
Cameron Davies, Stephen Goalby and David Oldham under the Post 
Admission Share Option Plan were conditional upon the achievement 
of a target increase of 5% in the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of the 
Company relative to that of the FTSE AIM Index between 8 April 2005 
and 31 December 2006. This target was achieved.
 No other options under the Plan were granted to or exercised 
by executive Directors during the year (2008: granted 2,000,000 
exercised nil). 
(ii) 2000 Share Option Plan
This Plan was established by the Company in 2000 for all executive 
Directors and employees. A maximum of one third of the options 
granted under the Plan became immediately exercisable on the 
Company's fl otation on the London Stock Exchange on 14 December 
2000 and the remainder may be exercised by option holders from the 
third anniversary of the grant up to the tenth anniversary of the grant. 
Share options granted under this Plan have no performance criteria 
because at the time of establishment of the Plan the Company was 
not listed. No future options may be granted under this Plan.
(iii) Individual option arrangement
In addition to the above Plans, options were previously granted 
to certain executive Directors under a bespoke unapproved share 
option arrangement, executed under a Deed dated 30 October 1997. 
Under this deed Dr Cameron Davies and David Oldham were granted 
options to subscribe for 142,800 and 154,200 ordinary shares of 
0.5 pence each respectively. The options became exercisable from 
14 December 2000 and lapse on 13 December 2010. Share options 
granted under this Deed have no performance criteria because at the 
time of the grant of the share options the Company was not listed. 
(iv) Savings Related Share Option Scheme
During 2002 the Company introduced a Savings Related Share 
Option Scheme, (the  Sharesave' or  SAYE' Scheme). This Scheme 
was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2002 
and is approved by HMRC. The executive Directors may participate in 
the Sharesave Scheme on equal eligibility terms with all employees. 
Participants may save between  5 and  250 per month, through 
payroll deduction for a period of three or fi ve years, after which time 
they can acquire shares at a discount of up to 20 per cent (set at the 
time of invitation) of the market value. The Scheme is designed to 
provide a long-term savings and investment opportunity.
(v) Long-term incentives
There are currently no long-term incentive plans in place. 
Further details of the executive Directors' interests in share options are 
set out on page 28.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial period of 
two years. Re-appointment beyond a second term or subsequent 
term is subject to consideration by the Nomination Committee for 
recommendation to the Board. John Lander was appointed on 4 June 
2004 and has been re-appointed for a third term commencing on 4 June 
2008. Julia Henderson was appointed on 1 June 2007 and has been 
re-appointed for a second term commencing on 1 June 2009. Lord Fraser 
resigned on 6 May 2009. Cameron Davies retired an executive Director 
on 31 October 2009 and was appointed a Non-Executive Director on 
1 November 2009. Joe Darby was appointed a Non-Executive Director on 
1 January 2010. Fees are determined by the Board based on independent 
advice and by comparison with fees paid by other companies of similar 
size and complexity, and refl ect the amount of time Non-Executive 
Directors are expected to devote to the Group's activities during the 
year. No additional fees are paid to Non-Executive Directors who chair 
Committees of the Board. Individual Directors are not involved in any 
discussion concerning their own remuneration. There is no notice period 
in respect of Non-Executive Directors' appointment, and no benefi ts are 
payable to them on termination of appointment.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for pensions, share incentives, 
annual bonus or any similar payments other than out-of-pocket expenses 
in connection with the performance of their duties.
Service contracts and notice periods
The executive Directors have service contracts with the Company, which 
are not of fi xed duration and which are terminable in each case by either 
party giving 12 months' written notice. The service contracts allow the 
Company to terminate the employment of an executive Director without 
notice by making a payment in lieu of notice calculated to compensate 
the executive Directors for salary and contractual benefi ts over the 
unexpired period of notice although the Company is not obliged to 
exercise its right to make a payment in lieu of notice. Copies of service 
contracts are available for inspection prior to and during the Annual 
General Meeting.
The details of the executive Directors' individual service contracts are set 
out below:

External appointments
The Committee recognises that executive Directors may be invited to take 
up non-executive directorships or public appointments and believes the 
Group can benefi t from such external appointments. Accordingly, subject 
to Board approval, executive Directors may accept such appointments 
providing that this is not likely to lead to a confl ict of interest with the 
Company's activities and that the wider exposure gained will be benefi cial 
to the development of the individual. 26
