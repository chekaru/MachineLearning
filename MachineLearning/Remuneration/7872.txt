 26 Alkane Energy plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011
Scope of report
The Directors' Remuneration Report sets out the Company's 
remuneration policy and, particularly, its approach for directors. It  
also explains how the Company complies with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code to the extent practicable for a public company of its 
size which follows the recommendation on corporate governance of 
the Quoted Companies Alliance. This Report has been prepared by the 
Remuneration Committee (the  Committee') and has been approved 
by the Board for submission to shareholders. The Board accepted the 
Committee's Report without change.
Shareholders will be provided with an opportunity to vote on 
remuneration policy as set out in this Report at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting. Further details are contained in the Notice  
of Annual General Meeting circulated to shareholders.
Composition and role of the Committee
The Committee is made up entirely of non-executive directors, 
currently Joe Darby (Chairman), Julia Henderson and John Lander. 
Their biographical details appear on pages 18 and 19.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference and meets 
as required to:
 	 Make recommendations to the Board on the broad policy and 
framework for executive directors' remuneration and its cost; and
 	 Determine the total remuneration package and contractual terms 
for each of the executive directors.
It is also responsible for overseeing the management and 
administration of the Group's remuneration and share schemes for 
employees, including the award of share option and performance 
share entitlements.
The members of the Committee do not have any personal financial 
interests, other than as shareholders, or any conflicts from cross-
directorships or day-to-day involvement in the running of the Group.
The Committee has access to independent external advisers on all 
remuneration-related issues and may obtain advice in determining 
individual remuneration levels from remuneration consultants 
appointed by the Committee. The results of market surveys and  
other analysis from external sources are also made available to the 
Committee. When appropriate, the Committee invites the views of 
the Chief Executive Officer and the Finance Director, but they are not 
involved in discussions concerning their own remuneration.
The Committee met on three occasions in 2011.
Remuneration policy
The Committee has adopted a remuneration policy designed to:
 	 Attract, retain and motivate the high calibre professional, 
managerial and technological expertise necessary to realise the 
Group's business objectives without paying excessively;
 	 Ensure that the remuneration framework and the constituent 
reward elements are competitive and fairly reflect, as necessary, 
the nature and complexity of the Group's business and the markets 
within which the Group operates;
 	 In general terms, set base salary broadly in line with median market 
practice, whilst achieving higher earnings by linking cash incentive 
packages (e.g. bonuses) and share options to superior 
performance;
 	 Create overall remuneration packages in which performance-
related elements form a significant proportion; and
 	 Maintain the correct balance and linkage between individual and 
business performance so as to effectively align the interests of 
directors and senior management with those of shareholders, 
particularly that of enhancing shareholder value.
Elements of remuneration
Each executive director's remuneration package consists of the 
following elements:
 	 Basic salary and benefits;
 	 Benefits in kind;
 	 Performance-related bonus;
 	 Pensions and life assurance arrangements; and
 	 Share options and long-term share incentives.
Full details of the directors' remuneration for the year ended  
31 December 2011 are set out on pages 29 to 31.
Basic salary
Basic salary for each executive director is reviewed annually taking  
into account assessments of the overall Company performance,  
the director's personal performance, experience and changing 
responsibilities and the median market position (against businesses of 
similar size and complexity). Account is also taken of salary levels and 
employment conditions across the Group.
Benefits in kind
Other corporate benefits play a role in ensuring the competitiveness of 
overall remuneration arrangements. The most significant benefits 
agreed by the Committee are car allowance (where there are ceilings 
on expenditure) and the provision of insurance policies providing cover 
for health care. In addition, the Company pays certain motoring and 
accommodation expenses for Neil O'Brien. Benefits are valued in 
accordance with HMRC rules.
Performance-related bonus
The Company has a performance-related bonus scheme under which 
all staff, including executive directors, were eligible for a maximum 
bonus of 25% of basic salary based on the achievement of both 
increased profit and increased production. No payments to directors 
have been approved by the Remuneration Committee in respect of 
the performance for the year to 31 December 2011 (2010: nil)
Recognising the continuing commitments and efforts being asked of 
staff in achieving the Company's challenging expansion programme, 
the Remuneration Committee has approved a bonus scheme for 2012 
for all staff, including executive directors, based on the achievement of 
targets related to Group profit, output and production costs, securing 
new business opportunities, and ensuring that the Company remains 
strongly financed.
The maximum potential bonus payment available under the scheme is 
50% of basic salary.
Bonuses are not pensionable.
Pensions and life assurance
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Pension 
contributions for executive directors are based on salary only, with 
other discretionary benefits excluded. For the financial year under 
review, the Company contributed 10% of basic salary (2010: 10%). 
Non-executive directors are ineligible to join the Company's  
pension scheme.

Share options and long-term share incentives
(i) 2011 Employee Share Incentive Plan
 Approval was given at the Annual General Meeting of the 
Company held on 4 May 2011 to introduce a new comprehensive 
Share Incentive Plan (the  Plan') comprising; (a) a Performance 
Share Plan; (b) Employee Share Option Plan; and (c) Sharesave 
Scheme. This Plan was designed to replace the previous schemes 
which are now closed with no further awards being granted. 
Non-executive directors are not eligible for participation in the 
Plan.
(a) Performance Share Plan ( PSP')
 The PSP is open to all employees including executive directors. 
The operation of the PSP is subject to ongoing review by the 
Committee with regards to the level of allocation and frequency 
of individual awards, conditional that the awards granted in any 
10 year period shall not exceed 10% of the nominal share 
capital.
 The exercise of awards granted under the PSP is conditional 
upon the achievement of objective performance targets set at 
the time of grant.
 During the year awards of 1,107,000 Ordinary shares of 0.5p 
were made to executive directors, exercisable on the vesting 
date of 31 March 2014 on the achievement of the following 
performance targets:
 Up to 50% maximum on the increase in share price at 
vesting date from base level of 20p.
 Up to 50% maximum on the achievement of increased 
adjusted profit per share as at 31 December 2013 from the 
adjusted profit per share at 31 December 2010. In respect of 
both criteria shares will be vested in proportion to the level 
of growth, with maximum vesting at 25% per annum.
 In respect of both criteria, shares will be vested in proportion to the 
level of achievement.
(b) Employee Share Option Plan ( ESOP')
 The Committee has the authority to grant options under the 
ESOP, either:
 Part A which has been formally approved by HMRC under 
schedule 4 to ITEPA or Part B which will not receive any  
of the beneficial tax treatment available for options granted 
under Part A. 
 The ESOP is open to all employees, including full-time executive 
directors. For all options granted, the option price is determined 
by reference to the market value at the date of grant and all 
personnel are required to pay the full grant price on exercise.
 Options granted under the ESOP are exercisable between three 
and 10 years from the award, subject where appropriate to the 
achievement of an objective performance target set at the time 
of grant.
 The operation of the Plan is subject to on-going review by the 
Committee in particular with respect to amendment or waiver 
of any grant targets provided the revised target is not materially 
more difficult to achieve than the original performance target.
 No options were granted to executive directors during the year.
(c) Sharesave Scheme 2011 ( Sharesave')
 The scheme is open to all eligible employees, to provide a 
long-term savings and investment opportunity for all staff. 
Executive directors are permitted to participate in the Sharesave 
Scheme, on equal eligibility terms as other employees, which 
allows participants to save between  5 and  250 per month, 
through payroll deductions for a period of three to five years 
after which they can acquire shares at a discount of up to 20% 
of the market value, set at the time of invitation.
 No options were granted to executive directors during the year.
 As is the case with all savings-related schemes there are no 
performance criteria.
(ii) Closed Incentive Plan 
 The Company's Post Admission Share Option Scheme (the 
 Scheme') which has been in operation for executive directors and 
employees since 2001 was closed for new option awards in March 
2011. However, options granted under the Scheme may continue 
to be exercised up to their latest exercise date. For all options 
granted, the option price is determined by reference to the market 
value at the date of grant and all personnel are required to pay the 
full grant price on exercise.
 Options granted under the Scheme are exercisable between three 
and 10 years from the award. The operation of the Scheme, with 
regards to the level of allocation and frequency of issue of options, 
was at the discretion of the Committee, taking into account the 
practice of comparable companies and the guidelines of the 
Association of Business Insurers. 
 During the year no share options under the Scheme were granted 
to, and no share options were exercised by, executive directors 
(2010: granted 173,685, exercised nil).
Further details of the executive directors' interests in share options are 
set out on page 30. 28 Alkane Energy plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period of two years. Re-appointment beyond a second term or subsequent term is 
subject to consideration by the Nomination Committee for recommendation to the Board. John Lander was appointed on 4 June 2004 and has 
been re-appointed for a fourth term commencing on 4 June 2010. Julia Henderson was appointed on 1 June 2007 and has been re-appointed 
for a third term commencing on 1 June 2011. Cameron Davies retired as an executive director on 31 October 2009, initially appointed a 
non-executive director on 1 November 2009 and subsequently re-appointed a non-executive director on 1 November 2011. Joe Darby was 
appointed a non-executive director on 1 January 2010 and will be offering himself for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Fees are determined by the Board based on independent advice and by comparison with fees paid by other companies of similar size and 
complexity, and reflect the amount of time non-executive directors are expected to devote to the Group's activities during the year. No 
additional fees are paid to non-executive directors who chair committees of the Board. Individual directors are not involved in any discussion 
concerning their own remuneration. There is no notice period in respect of non-executive directors' appointment, and no benefits are payable 
to them on termination of appointment.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for pensions, share incentives or any similar payments other than out-of-pocket expenses in connection 
with the performance of their duties.
Service contracts and notice periods
The executive directors have service contracts with the Company, which are not of fixed duration and which are terminable in each case by 
either party giving 12 months' written notice. The service contracts allow the Company to terminate the employment of an executive director 
without notice by making a payment in lieu of notice calculated to compensate the executive directors for salary and contractual benefits over 
the unexpired period of notice although the Company is not obliged to exercise its right to make a payment in lieu of notice. Copies of service 
contracts are available for inspection prior to and during the Annual General Meeting.
The details of the executive directors' individual service contracts are set out below:

Notice 
period
Neil O'Brien 1 November 2008 N/A 12 months
Stephen Goalby 6 December 2000 N/A 12 months
External appointments
The Committee recognises that executive directors may be invited to take up non-executive directorships or public appointments and  
believes the Group can benefit from such external appointments. Accordingly, subject to Board approval, executive directors may accept such 
appointments providing that this is not likely to lead to a conflict of interest with the Company's activities and that the wider exposure gained 
will be beneficial to the development of the individual.
