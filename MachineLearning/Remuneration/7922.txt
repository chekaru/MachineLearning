Directors' Remuneration Report
Scope of Report
The Directors' Remuneration Report sets out the 
Company's remuneration policy and, particularly, 
its approach for directors. The Company is not 
required to comply with Schedule 8 to The Large and 
Medium - sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) Regulations 2008 but follows the 
recommendation on corporate governance of the 
Quoted Companies Alliance. This Report has been 
prepared by the Remuneration Committee (the 
 Committee') and has been approved by the Board 
for submission to shareholders. The Board accepted 
the Committee's Report without change.
Shareholders will be provided with an opportunity 
to vote on remuneration policy as set out in this 
Report at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Further details are contained in the Notice of Annual 
General Meeting circulated to shareholders.

Biographical details of members of the Committee 
appear	on	pages	  .
The Committee operates within agreed terms of 
reference and meets as required to:
 	 Make recommendations to the Board on the 
broad policy and framework for executive directors' 
remuneration and its cost; and
 	 Determine the total remuneration package and 
contractual terms for each of the executive 
directors.
It is also responsible for overseeing the management 
and administration of the Group's remuneration and 
share schemes for employees, including the award of 
share option and performance share entitlements.
The members of the Committee do not have 
any personal financial interests, other than as 
shareholders, or any conflicts from cross-directorships 
or day-to-day involvement in the running of the Group.
The Committee has access to independent external 
advisers on all remuneration-related issues and may 
obtain advice in determining individual remuneration 
levels from remuneration consultants appointed by 
the Committee. The results of market surveys and 
other analysis from external sources are also made 
available to the Committee. When appropriate, the 
Committee invites the views of the Chief Executive 
Officer and the Finance Director, but they are 
not involved in discussions concerning their own 
remuneration.
Remuneration Policy
The Committee has adopted a remuneration policy 
designed to:
 	 Attract, retain and motivate the high calibre 
professional, managerial and technological 
expertise necessary to realise the Group's business 
objectives without paying excessively;
 	 Ensure that the remuneration framework and 
the constituent reward elements are competitive 
and fairly reflect, as necessary, the nature and 
complexity of the Group's business and the markets 
within which the Group operates;
 	 In general terms, set base salary broadly in line 
with median market practice, whilst achieving 
higher earnings by linking cash incentive packages 
(e.g. bonuses) and share options to superior 
performance;
 	 Create overall remuneration packages in which 
performance-related elements form a significant 
proportion; and
 	 Maintain the correct balance and linkage between 
individual and business performance so as to 
effectively align the interests of directors and 
senior management with those of shareholders, 
particularly that of enhancing shareholder value.

Elements of Remuneration
Each executive director's remuneration package 
consists of the following elements:
 	 Basic salary and benefits;
 	 Benefits in kind;
 	 Performance-related bonus;
 	 Pensions and life assurance arrangements; and
 	 Share options and long-term share incentives.
Full details of the directors' remuneration for the year 
ended 31 December 2013 are set out on pages  
28 and 29.
Basic Salary
Basic salary for each executive director is reviewed 
annually taking into account assessments of 
the overall Company performance, the director's 
personal performance, experience and changing 
responsibilities and the median market position 
(against businesses of similar size and complexity). 
Account is also taken of salary levels and 
employment conditions across the Group.
Benefits in Kind
Other corporate benefits play a role in ensuring 
the competitiveness of overall remuneration 
arrangements. The most significant benefits agreed 
by the Committee are car allowance (where there 
are ceilings on expenditure) and the provision of 
insurance policies providing cover for health care. In 
addition, the Company pays certain motoring and 
accommodation expenses for Neil O'Brien. Benefits 
are valued in accordance with HMRC rules.
Performance-Related Bonus
The Company has a performance-related bonus 
scheme under which all staff were eligible for a 
maximum bonus of 50% of basic salary for executive 
directors and 25% of basic salary for all other staff, 
based on the achievement of both increased 
profit and increased production. Total Payments of 
 83,617 to executive directors have been approved 
by the Remuneration Committee in respect of the 
performance for the year to 31 December 2013 
(2012:  114,022).
Recognising the continuing commitments and efforts 
being asked of staff in achieving the Company's 
challenging expansion programme, the Remuneration 
Committee has approved a bonus scheme for 2014 
for all staff, including executive directors, based on the 
achievement of targets related to Group profit, output 
costs, delivery of the capital programme, securing new 
business opportunities and ensuring the Company 
remains well financed.
The maximum potential bonus payment available 
under the scheme is 50% of basic salary for executive 
directors and 25% for all other staff.
Bonuses are not pensionable.
Pensions and Life Assurance
The Group operates a defined contribution pension 
scheme. Pension contributions for executive directors 
are based on salary only, with other discretionary 
benefits excluded. For the financial year under review, 
the Company contributed 10% of basic salary  
(2012: 10%). Non-executive directors are ineligible to 
join the Company's pension scheme.
Share Options and Long Term Share Incentives
(i)  2011 Employee Share Incentive Plan
The 2011 Employee Share Incentive Plan ( Plan') 
comprises (a) a Performance Share Plan  
(b) Employee Share Option Plan and  
(c) Sharesave Scheme. This Plan was designed 
to replace the previous schemes which are now 
closed with no further awards being granted. 
Non-executive directors are not eligible for 
participation in the Plan.
(a) Performance Share Plan ( PSP')
The PSP is open to all employees including 
executive directors. The operation of the PSP is 
subject to ongoing review by the Committee with 
regards to the level of allocation and frequency 
of individual awards, conditional that the awards 
granted in any ten year period shall not exceed 
10% of the nominal share capital.
The exercise of awards granted under the PSP is 
conditional upon the achievement of objective 
performance targets set at the time of grant.
During the year awards of 929,083 Ordinary 
shares of 0.5p were made to executive directors, 
exercisable on the vesting date of 31 March 
2016 on the achievement of the following 
performance targets:
www.alkane.co.uk Stock code: ALK 23005-04 - Proof 9 - 27-03-2014
Directors' Remuneration Report continued
 	 Up to 50% maximum on the increase in the 
Company's total shareholder return at the 
vesting date from a base level of 27p.
 	 Up to 50% maximum on the achievement of 
increased adjusted profit per share as at  
31 December 2015 from the adjusted profit per 
share at 31 December 2012.
 	 In respect of each criteria shares will be vested 
in proportion to the level of achievement, with 
no shares vesting if the cumulative increase 
per annum is less than 10% and the maximum 
number of shares vesting if the cumulative 
increase per annum is 20% or greater.
(b) Employee Share Option Plan ( ESOP')
The Committee has the authority to grant options 
under the ESOP , either:
Part A which has been formally approved by 
HMRC under schedule 4 to ITEPA; or
Part B which will not receive any of the beneficial 
tax treatment available for options granted under 
Part A.
The ESOP is open to all employees, including full-
time executive directors.
For all options granted, the option price is 
determined by reference to the market value at 
the date of grant and all personnel are required 
to pay the full grant price on exercise.
Options granted under the ESOP are exercisable 
between three and ten years from the award, 
subject where appropriate to the achievement of 
an objective performance target set at the time 
of grant.
The operation of the Plan is subject to ongoing 
review by the Committee in particular with 
respect to amendment or waiver of any grant 
targets provided the revised target is not 
materially more difficult to achieve than the 
original performance target under this scheme.
(c) Sharesave Scheme 2011 ( Sharesave')
The scheme is open to all eligible employees, 
to provide a long-term savings and investment 
opportunity for all staff. Executive directors 
are permitted to participate in the Sharesave 
Scheme, on equal eligibility terms as other 
employees, which allows participants to save 
between  5 and  250 per month, through payroll 
deductions for a period of three to five years after 
which they can acquire shares at a discount of 
up to 20% of the market value, set at the time of 
invitation.
No share options were granted to executive 
directors during the year under this scheme.
Further details of the executive directors' interests 
in share options and performance shares are set 
out on pages 29 to 31.
(ii) Closed Incentive Plan
The Company's Post Admission Share Option 
Scheme (the  Scheme') which has been in 
operation for executive directors and employees 
since 2001 was closed for new option awards 
in March 2011. However, options granted under 
the Scheme may continue to be exercised up to 
their latest exercise date. For all options granted, 
the option price is determined by reference to 
the market value at the date of grant and all 
personnel are required to pay the full grant price 
on exercise.
Options granted under the Scheme are 
exercisable between three and ten years from 
the award. The operation of the Scheme, with 
regards to the level of allocation and frequency 
of issue of options, was at the discretion of the 
Committee, taking into account the practice of 
comparable companies and the guidelines of 
the Association of Business Insurers.
During the year no share options under the 
Scheme were exercised by executive directors 
(2012: nil).
Further details of the executive directors' interests in 
share options are set out on pages 30 to 31.
Non-Executive Directors
The non-executive directors are appointed for an 
initial period of two years. Reappointment beyond 
a second term or subsequent term is subject to 
consideration by the Nomination Committee for 
recommendation to the Board.

Julia Henderson will offer herself for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Fees are determined by the Board based on independent advice and by comparison with fees paid by other 
companies of similar size and complexity, and reflect the amount of time non-executive directors are expected 
to devote to the Group's activities during the year. No additional fees are paid to non-executive directors who 
chair committees of the Board. Individual directors are not involved in any discussion concerning their own 
remuneration. There is no notice period in respect of non-executive directors' appointment, and no benefits 
are payable to them on termination of appointment.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for pensions, share incentives or any similar payments other than out-
of-pocket expenses in connection with the performance of their duties.
Executive Directors' Service Contracts and Notice Periods
The executive directors have service contracts with the Company, which are not of fixed duration and which 
are terminable in each case by either party giving 12 months' written notice. The service contracts allow the 
Company to terminate the employment of an executive director without notice by making a payment in lieu of 
notice calculated to compensate the executive directors for salary and contractual benefits over the unexpired 
period of notice although the Company is not obliged to exercise its right to make a payment in lieu of notice. 
Copies of service contracts are available for inspection prior to and during the Annual General Meeting.
The details of the executive directors' individual service contracts are set out below:
Executive director Date of service contract
Unexpired term at  
31 December 2013 Notice period
Neil O'Brien 1 November 2008 N/A 12 months
Stephen Goalby 6 December 2000 N/A 12 months
Neil O'Brien will offer himself for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
External Appointments
The Committee recognises that executive directors may be invited to take up non-executive directorships 
or public appointments and believes the Group can benefit from such external appointments. Accordingly, 
subject to Board approval, executive directors may accept such appointments provided that this is not likely 
to lead to a conflict of interest with the Company's activities and that the wider exposure gained will be 
beneficial to the development of the individual.
