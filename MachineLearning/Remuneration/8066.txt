 17 Allergy Therapeutics plc Annual Report & Accounts 2005
The Remuneration Committee (unaudited)
The Remuneration Committee was formed on 8 October 
2004 and comprises Steve Smith (Chairman) and Ignace 
Goethals. A remuneration committee was in place prior to 
8 October 2004 for the Group's former holding company. 
The Committee held 2 meetings during the past financial 
year which were also attended by the Human Resources 
Manager. The principle purpose of the Committee is to agree 
the directors' salary increases, annual bonuses and any 
changes in benefits. In addition, the Committee also agrees 
the share-related compensation for the directors and other 
executive management, approves performance-related pay 
schemes of the Group and other executive compensation 
matters. For the purpose of reaching appropriate decisions 
the Committee has used information from the Alan Jones 
& Associates  Pharmaceutical Salary Survey', the Halliwell 
Consulting  Executive Pay in the Pharmaceuticals & Bio 
Tech Sector' report and a sample taken from AIM listed 
pharmaceutical companies of similar size and value (the 
 Comparator Group').
Remuneration policy (unaudited)
The Committee's policy is to set remuneration packages for 
executive directors that are competitive with the market, 
allowing the Company to attract, motivate and retain 
executives of the highest calibre. Remuneration packages are 
designed to reward executives for performance via annual 
bonus payments and awards of share-related compensation, 
which together constitute a potentially significant proportion 
of the total remuneration opportunity.
The remuneration of executive directors comprises the 
following five elements:
(i) Basic salary
Basic salary reflects the market rate for each position 
and the individual director's experience and value to the 
business. Salaries are reviewed annually as at 1 October, 
taking into account personal performance, and are 
benchmarked against the Comparator Group.
(ii) Taxable benefits
Taxable benefits represent the provision of a car allowance 
and private medical insurance.
Directors' Remuneration Report
(iii) Share options
Executive share options have been granted to directors and 
senior management under the Allergy Therapeutics plc 2005 
Executive Share Option Plan and are exercisable between 
3 and 10 years from the date of grant, subject to continued 
employment and the satisfaction of performance conditions. 
The number of Executive share options were approved on 
the basis of 2 times annual salary for the Chief Executive 
and, for all other executive directors, 1  times annual salary. 
The share options granted to individual executive directors  
to date are disclosed later in this report and include grants 
made in prior years under previous approved and unapproved 
option schemes. Share options previously granted by Allergy 
Therapeutics (Holdings) Ltd were surrendered on 5 October 
2004 for share options in Allergy Therapeutics plc, on 
substantially the same terms.
 
(iv) Bonus
In the case of the executive team the Company operates 
a performance related cash bonus based upon individual 
performance and achievement of personal and corporate 
objectives. The performance-related bonus for the year 
ending 30 June 2005 ranged between 25% and 40% of basic 
salary. Annual bonus payments are capped under service 
contracts at 40% for K Carter and 30% for all other directors 
except C Gr tz, whose bonus is uncapped. 
 
(v) Pension arrangements
The UK Company operates a Group Personal Pension Scheme 
and currently makes pension contributions equal to 10% of 
salary for executive directors, with the exception of K Carter 
for whom the Company contributes 13% of salary. 
C Gr tz is a member of Bencard Allergie's pension scheme, 
which provides a defined benefit on retirement. Bencard 
Allergie's contributions are based on actuarial reports provided 
by Swiss Life Pension Management. The pension liability is 
insured through a reinsurance contract with Swiss Life. 18 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Allergy Therapeutics plc
