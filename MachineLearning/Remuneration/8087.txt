The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Stephen Smith (Chairman), Ignace Goethals and Dr Virinder Nohria. The Committee held three meetings during 
the past fi nancial year which were also attended by the Human Resources Manager. The principle purpose of the Committee is to determine and agree 
the Directors' salary increases, annual bonuses, scope of pension arrangements and any changes in benefi ts. In addition, the Committee also agrees the 
share-related compensation for the Directors and other executive management and other executive compensation matters. For the purpose of reaching 
appropriate decisions the Committee has used information from the Alan Jones & Associates  Pharmaceutical Salary Survey', benchmarking reports from 
MM&K and Watson Wyatt Data Services and a sample taken from AIM listed pharmaceutical companies of similar size and value (the  Comparator Group').
Remuneration policy
The Committee's policy is to set remuneration packages for executive Directors that are competitive with the market, allowing the Company to attract, 
motivate and retain executives of the highest calibre. Remuneration packages are designed to reward executives for performance via annual bonus 
payments and awards of share-related compensation, which together constitute a potentially signifi cant proportion of the total remuneration opportunity.
The remuneration of executive Directors comprises the following elements:
(i) Basic salary
Basic salary refl ects the market rate for each position and the individual Director's experience and value to the business. Salaries are reviewed annually 
as at 1 October, taking into account personal performance, and are benchmarked against the Comparator Group.
(ii) Taxable benefi ts
Taxable benefi ts represent the provision of a car allowance and private medical insurance.
(iii) Share options
The share options granted to individual executive Directors to date are disclosed later in this report and comprise grants made in prior years under 
previous approved and unapproved option schemes. Share options previously granted by Allergy Therapeutics (Holdings) Ltd were surrendered on 
5 October 2004 for share options in Allergy Therapeutics plc, on substantially the same terms.
(iv) Long Term Incentive Plan
During the year ended 30 June 2007 provisional shares were awarded to Directors and senior management under the Allergy Therapeutics plc 2005 Long 
Term Incentive Plan. Distribution of shares under the Plan is conditional on the Company's performance over the three-year Plan Cycle. The value of shares 
allocated to executive Directors during the year was between 71% and 86% of annual salary. The number of provisional shares awarded to executive 
Directors is shown below.

(v) SAYE Plan
The 2005 SAYE Plan was open to all employees and full-time executive Directors who had completed 12 months' continuous service at the offer date. 
Share options were granted at a 15% discount to the share price at the date of grant. The number of options granted to each participant is related to the 
amount which the participant has contracted to save over the three-year term of the Plan. The number of share options granted to executive Directors 
under the Plan is shown in the Directors' share options table.
(vi) Bonus
In the case of the executive team the Company operates a performance-related cash bonus based upon individual performance and achievement of 
personal and corporate objectives. The performance-related bonus provisions for the year ending 30 June 2007 ranged between 10% and 15% of basic 
salary. Annual bonus payments are capped under service contracts at 40% for Keith Carter and 30% for all other Directors except Christian Gr tz, whose 
bonus is uncapped.
 
(vii) Pension arrangements
The UK Company operates a defi ned-contribution Personal Pension scheme and currently makes pension contributions equal to 10% of salary for 
executive Directors, with the exception of Keith Carter for whom the Company contributes 13% of salary. 
Christian Gr tz is a member of the Bencard Allergie GmbH pension scheme in Germany.
