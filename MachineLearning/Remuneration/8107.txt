22 Allergy Therapeutics plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Stephen Smith (Chairman), Ignace Goethals and Dr Virinder Nohria. The Committee held three meetings 
during the past financial year which were also attended by the Human Resources Manager. The principal purpose of the Committee is to determine 
and agree the Directors' salary increases, annual bonuses, scope of pension arrangements and any changes in benefits. In addition, the Committee 
also agrees the share-related compensation for the Directors and other executive management and other executive compensation matters. For the 
purpose of reaching appropriate decisions the Committee has used information from the Alan Jones & Associates  Pharmaceutical Salary Survey', 
benchmarking reports from MM&K and Watson Wyatt Data Services and a sample taken from AIM listed pharmaceutical companies of similar size  
and value (the  Comparator Group').
Remuneration policy
The Committee's policy is to set remuneration packages for executive directors that are competitive with the market, allowing the Company to 
attract, motivate and retain executives of the highest calibre. Remuneration packages are designed to reward executives for performance via annual 
bonus payments and awards of share-related compensation, which together constitute a potentially significant proportion of the total remuneration 
opportunity.
The remuneration of executive directors comprises the following elements:
(i) Basic salary
Basic salary reflects the market rate for each position and the individual director's experience and value to the business. Salaries are reviewed 
annually as at 1 October, taking into account personal performance, and are benchmarked against the Comparator Group.
(ii) Taxable benefits
Taxable benefits represent the provision of a car allowance and private medical insurance.
(iii) Share options
The share options granted to individual executive directors to date are disclosed later in this report and comprise grants made in prior years under 
previous approved and unapproved option schemes. Share options previously granted by Allergy Therapeutics (Holdings) Ltd were surrendered on  
5 October 2004 for share options in Allergy Therapeutics plc, on substantially the same terms.
(iv) Long Term Incentive Plan
During the year ended 30 June 2008 provisional shares were awarded to directors and senior management under the Allergy Therapeutics plc 2005 
Long Term Incentive Plan. Distribution of shares under the Plan is conditional on the Company's performance over the 3-year Plan Cycle. The number 
of provisional shares awarded to executive directors under the Plan is shown in the Directors' share option table.
(v) SAYE Plan
The 2005 SAYE Plan was open to all employees and full-time executive directors who had completed 12 months continuous service at the offer date. 
Share options were granted at a discount to the share price at the date of grant. The number of options granted to each participant is related to the 
amount which the participant has contracted to save over the 3-year term of the Plan. The number of share options granted to executive directors 
under the Plan is shown in the Directors' share options table.
(vi) Bonus
In the case of the executive team the Company operates a performance-related cash bonus based upon individual performance and achievement of 
personal and corporate objectives. Annual bonus payments are capped under service contracts at 40% for Keith Carter and 30% for all other directors 
except Christian Gr tz, whose bonus is uncapped. The bonus is determined and agreed by the Remuneration Committee in September each year for 
the preceding financial year.
