The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Stephen Smith 
(Chairman), Ignace Goethals and Dr Virinder Nohria.  
The Committee held four meetings during the past financial
year. The principle purpose of the Committee is to determine
and agree the directors' salary increases, annual bonuses, 
scope of pension arrangements and any changes in benefits. 
In addition, the Committee also agrees the share-related 
compensation for the directors and other executive 
management and other executive compensation matters. 
For the purpose of reaching appropriate decisions the 
Committee has used information from the Alan Jones & 
Associates  Pharmaceutical Salary Survey', benchmarking 
reports from MM&K and Watson Wyatt Data Services and 
a sample taken from AIM listed pharmaceutical companies 
of similar size and value (the Comparator Group ).
Remuneration policy
The Committee's policy is to set remuneration packages for 
executive directors that are competitive with the market, 
allowing the Company to attract, motivate and retain executives
of the highest calibre. Remuneration packages are designed to
reward executives for performance via annual bonus payments
and awards of share-related compensation, which together 
constitute a potentially significant proportion of the total 
remuneration opportunity.
The remuneration of executive directors comprises the following
elements:
(i) Basic salary
Basic salary reflects the market rate for each position and the 
individual director's experience and value to the business.
Salaries are reviewed annually as at 1 October, taking into 
account personal performance, and are benchmarked against
the Comparator Group.
(ii) Taxable benefits
Taxable benefits represent the provision of a car allowance 
and private medical insurance.
(iii) Share options
The share options granted to individual executive directors 
to date are disclosed later in this report and comprise grants
made in prior years under previous approved and unapproved
option schemes. Share options previously granted by Allergy 
Therapeutics (Holdings) Limited were surrendered on 5 October
2004 for share options in Allergy Therapeutics plc, 
on substantially the same terms.
(iv) Long Term Incentive Plan
During the year ended 30 June 2009 no provisional shares 
were awarded to directors and senior management under 
the Allergy Therapeutics plc 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan. 
Distribution of shares under the Plan is conditional on the 
Company's performance over the 3-year Plan Cycle. 
The number of provisional shares awarded to executive 
directors under the Plan is shown in the Directors' share 
option table.
(v) SAYE Plan
The 2005 SAYE Plan was open to all employees and full-time 
executive directors who had completed 12 months continuous
service at the offer date. Share options were granted at a 
discount to the share price at the date of grant. The number 
of options granted to each participant is related to the amount
which the participant has contracted to save over the 3-year 
term of the Plan. The number of share options granted to 
executive directors under the Plan is shown in the Directors'
share options table.
(vi) Bonus
In the case of the executive team the Company operates a 
performance-related cash bonus based upon individual 
performance and achievement of personal and corporate 
objectives. Annual bonus payments are capped under service
contracts at 40% for Keith Carter and 30% for all other directors
except Christian Gr tz, whose bonus is uncapped. The bonus 
is determined and agreed by the Remuneration Committee in 
September each year for the preceding financial year. 
(vii) Pension arrangements
The UK Company operates a defined-contribution Personal 
Pension scheme and currently makes pension contributions
equal to 10% of salary for executive directors, with the exception
of Keith Carter for whom the Company contributes 15% of
salary. Christian Gr tz is a member of the Bencard Allergie
GmbH pension scheme in Germany.
