Remuneration policy
The Committee's policy is to set remuneration packages for
Executive Directors that are competitive with the market, allowing
the Company to attract, motivate and retain executives of the
highest calibre. Remuneration packages are designed to reward
executives for performance via annual bonus payments and
awards of share-related compensation, which together constitute
a potentially significant proportion of the total remuneration
opportunity.
The remuneration of Executive Directors comprises the following
elements:
(i) Basic salary
Basic salary reflects the market rate for each position and the
individual director's experience and value to the business.
Salaries are reviewed annually as at 1 October, taking into
account personal performance, and are benchmarked against
the Comparator Group.
(ii)Taxable benefits
Taxable benefits represent the provision of a car allowance
and private medical insurance.
(iii) Share options
The share options granted to individual Executive Directors
to date are disclosed later in this report and comprise grants
made in prior years under previous approved and unapproved
option schemes. Share options previously granted by Allergy
Therapeutics (Holdings) Limited were surrendered on 5 October
2004 for share options in AllergyTherapeutics plc, on substantially
the same terms.
(iv) LongTerm Incentive Plan
During the year ended 30 June 2010 provisional shares were
awarded to directors and senior management under the Allergy
Therapeutics plc 2005 LongTerm Incentive Plan. Distribution of
shares under the Plan is conditional on the Group's performance
over the 3-year Plan Cycle.The number of provisional shares
awarded to Executive Directors under the Plan is shown in the
Directors' share option table.
(v) SAYE plan
The 2005 SAYE Plan was open to all employees and full-time
Executive Directors who had completed 12 months continuous
service at the offer date. Share options were granted at a discount
to the share price at the date of grant.The number of options
granted to each participant is related to the amount which the
participant has contracted to save over the 3-year term of the
Plan.The number of share options granted to Executive Directors
under the Plan is shown in the Directors' share options table.
During the year ended 30 June 2010 no offer was made to
employees or executives under the SAYE scheme.
(vi) Bonus
In the case of the executive team, the Group operates a
performance-related cash bonus based upon individual
performance and achievement of personal and corporate
objectives. Annual bonus payments are capped under service
contracts at 40% for Manuel Llobet and 30% for all other directors
except Christian Gr tz, whose bonus is uncapped.The bonus is
determined and agreed by the Remuneration Committee in
September each year for the preceding financial year.
(vii) Pension arrangements
The UK Company operates a defined-contribution Personal
Pension scheme and currently makes pension contributions
equal to 10% of salary for Executive Directors, with the exception
of Manuel Llobet for whom the Company contributes 15% of
salary. Christian Gr tz is a member of the Bencard Allergie
GmbH pension scheme in Germany.
