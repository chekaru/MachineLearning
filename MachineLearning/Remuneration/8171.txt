Remuneration policy 
The Committee's policy is to set remuneration packages 
for Executive Directors that are competitive with the 
market, allowing the Company to attract, motivate and 
retain executives of the highest calibre. Remuneration 
packages are designed to reward executives for 
performance via annual bonus payments and awards  
of share-related compensation, which together constitute 
a potentially significant proportion of the total remuneration 
opportunity.
The remuneration of Executive Directors comprises the 
following elements:
(i) Basic salary 
Basic salary is reviewed annually as at 1 October, taking 
into account personal performance, and benchmarked 
against the Comparator Group.
(ii) Taxable benefits 
Taxable benefits represent the provision of a car allowance 
and private medical insurance.
(iii) Share options 
No share options were granted in the year. The share 
options granted to individual Executive Directors to date 
are disclosed later in this report and comprise grants  
made in prior years under previous approved and 
unapproved option schemes. Share options previously 
granted by Allergy Therapeutics (Holdings) Limited  
were surrendered on 5 October 2004 for share options in  
Allergy Therapeutics plc, on substantially the same terms.
(iv) Long Term Incentive Plan 
During the year ended 30 June 2011 provisional shares 
were awarded to directors and senior management under 
the Allergy Therapeutics plc 2005 Long Term Incentive 
Plan. Distribution of shares under the Plan is conditional 
on the Group's performance over the 3-year Plan Cycle. 
The number of provisional shares awarded to Executive 
Directors under the Plan is shown in the Directors' share 
option table.
(v) SAYE Plan 
During the year ended 30 June 2011 no offer was made 
to employees or executives under the SAYE scheme. 
The 2005 SAYE Plan was open to all employees and full-
time Executive Directors who had completed 12 months 
continuous service at the offer date. Share options were 
granted at a discount to the share price at the date of 
grant. The number of options granted to each participant  
is related to the amount which the participant has 
contracted to save over the 3-year term of the Plan.  
The number of share options granted to Executive 
Directors under the Plan is shown in the Directors'  
share options table.
(vi) Bonus 
In the case of the executive team, the Group operates  
a performance-related cash bonus based upon individual 
performance and achievement of personal and corporate 
objectives. Annual bonus payments are capped under 
service contracts at 40% for Manuel Llobet and 30%  
for all other directors except Christian Gr tz, whose  
bonus is uncapped. The bonus is determined and  
agreed by the Remuneration Committee in September 
each year for the preceding financial year. 
(vii) Pension arrangements 
The UK Company operates a defined-contribution 
Personal Pension scheme and currently makes pension 
contributions equal to 10% of salary for Executive 
Directors, with the exception of Manuel Llobet for whom 
the Company contributes 15% of salary (subject to HMRC 
cap). Christian Gr tz was a member of the Bencard Allergie 
GmbH pension scheme in Germany.
