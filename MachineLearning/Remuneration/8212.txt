The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprised Stephen Smith 
(Chairman) and Thomas Lander during the financial year.  
The principal purpose of the Committee is to determine and 
agree the directors' salary increases, annual bonuses, scope 
of pension arrangements and any changes in benefits. 
In addition, the Committee also agrees the share-related 
compensation for the Directors and other executive 
management and other executive compensation matters.

Remuneration policy
The Committee's policy is to set remuneration packages for 
Executive Directors that are competitive with the market, 
allowing the Group to attract, motivate and retain executives 
of the highest calibre. Remuneration packages are designed 
to reward executives for performance via annual bonus 
payments and awards of share-related compensation, which 
together constitute a potentially significant proportion of the 
total remuneration opportunity.
The remuneration of Executive Directors comprises the 
following elements:
(i) Basic salary
Basic salary is reviewed annually as at 1 October, taking into 
account personal performance, and benchmarked against a 
comparator group.
(ii) T axable benefits
Taxable benefits represent the provision of a car allowance 
and private medical insurance.
(iii) Share options
No share options were granted in the year. The share options 
granted to individual Executive Directors to date are disclosed 
later in this report and comprise grants made in prior years 
under previous approved and unapproved option schemes. 
Share options previously granted by Allergy Therapeutics 
(Holdings) Limited were surrendered on 5 October 2004 for 
share options in Allergy Therapeutics plc, on substantially the 
same terms.
(iv) Long T erm Incentive Plan
During the year ended 30 June 2013 provisional shares 
were awarded to directors and senior management under the 
Allergy Therapeutics plc 2005 Long T erm Incentive Plan and the 
2013 Long Term Incentive Plan. The major shareholders were 
consulted on the new plan which was approved by the Board 
on 20 March 2013. The new plan is aligned with the Group's 
performance rather than on the performance compared to a 
group of other companies. The distribution of shares under 
the Plans is conditional on the Group's performance over the 
3-year Plan cycle. The number of provisional shares awarded to 
Executive Directors under the Plan is shown in the Directors' 
share option table.
(v) Bonus
In the case of the executive team, the Group operates a 
performance-related cash bonus based upon individual 
performance and achievement of personal and corporate 
objectives. Annual bonus payments are capped under service 
contracts at 40% for Manuel Llobet and 30% for other 
Executive Directors. The bonus is determined and agreed by 
the Remuneration Committee in September each year for the 
preceding financial year. 
 
(vi) Pension arrangements
The UK Company operates a defined-contribution Personal 
Pension scheme and currently makes pension contributions 
equal to 10% of salary for Executive Directors, with the 
exception of Manuel Llobet for whom the Group contributes 
15% of salary.
