best p ract Ice
As	the	Company	is	AIM-listed	it	is	not	legally	required	to	set	out	 its	remuneration	policy	but	is	doing	so	on	a	voluntary	basis.	To	 the	extent	that	such	principles	are	relevant	to	the	current	 circumstances	of	the	Company,	the	provisions	of	inter	alia	the	 Directors'	Remuneration	Report	Regulations	2002	and	the	 Combined	Code	are	taken	into	account.	 r eMunerat Ion p ol Icy
The	objective	of	the	Company's	remuneration	policy	is	to	 attract	and	retain	the	Directors	and	senior	executives	needed	to	 run	the	Company	in	a	cost-effective	manner.
The	remuneration	policy	of	the	Company	has	four	principal	 components:
1.	 basic salaries and benefits in kind -	Basic	salaries	are	 determined	by	the	Remuneration	Committee	bearing	in	 mind	the	salaries	paid	in	AIM-listed	and	other	small	market	 capitalisation	healthcare	companies.	Within	that	frame	of	 reference,	it	is	intended	that	pay	should	be	at	or	near	the	 median	level.	Benefits	in	kind	include	the	provision	of	 company	cars	(or	a	salary	alternative).
2.	 bonuses	-	Bonuses	are	payable	to	all	staff	according	to	the	 Directors'	 Remuneration
achievement	by	the	Company	of	certain	pre-determined	 Group	targets	including	earnings,	sales	growth	targets	and	 product	development	milestones.	The	level	of	bonuses	 payable	on	achievement	of	the	targets	is	set	at	the	level	 perceived	correct	to	provide	the	necessary	incentives	for	 executive	Directors	and	senior	managers.	There	are	 appropriate	adjustments	to	the	bonus	payable	in	the	event	 of	over-	or	under-achievement	of	the	Group	against	those	 targets.	In	addition,	bonuses	are	adjusted	for	personal	 performance	and	the	amount	of	bonus	paid	will	reflect	any	 substantial	periods	of	absence	or	unavailability	of	the	 employee.
3.	 share options scheme -	The	Company	has	in	place	a	share	 option	scheme	covering	all	employees,	under	which	share	 options	are	normally	granted	once	a	year.	The	exercise	price	 of	the	options	granted	under	the	scheme	is	set	equal	to	the	 market	value	of	the	Company's	shares	at	the	time	of	grant.	 The	share	option	scheme	is	overseen	by	the	Remuneration	 Committee	which	shall	determine	the	terms	under	which	 eligible	individuals	may	be	invited	to	participate.	It	is	 intended	that	the	scheme	should	be	an	approved	scheme	 but	may	be	unapproved	in	relation	to	certain	individuals.
4.	 pensions	-There	is	a	defined	contribution	scheme	for	all	 executive	Directors	and	employees.	Benefits	in	kind	are	not	 pensionable.	 Report	of	the	Directors 	 ALLIANCE	 PHARMA	 plc	 17
