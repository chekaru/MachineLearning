DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
 
Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee are:
Paul Ranson (Chairman of the Remuneration Committee)
Michael Gatenby
Andrew Smith
The Company Secretary attends the meetings of the Remuneration Committee as secretary to the Remuneration Committee. The Chief Executive 
Officer of the Company may also be invited to attend certain meetings of the Remuneration Committee.
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee reviews and determines on behalf of the Board and shareholders of the Company the pay, benefits and other terms 
of service of the Executive Directors of the Company and the broad pay strategy with respect to senior Company employees.
Remuneration Policy
As the Company is AIM-listed it is not legally required to set out its remuneration policy but is doing so on a voluntary basis. The objective of the 
Company's remuneration policy is to attract and retain the Directors and senior Executives needed to run the Company in a cost-effective manner.
The remuneration policy of the Company has four principal components:
1. Basic Salaries and Benefits in Kind - Basic salaries are determined by the Remuneration Committee bearing in mind the salaries paid in 
AIM-listed and other small market capitalisation healthcare companies. Within that frame of reference, it is intended that pay should be at or 
near the median level. Benefits in kind include the provision of company cars (or a salary alternative).
2. Bonuses - Bonuses are payable to all staff according to the achievement by the Group of certain pre-determined targets including earnings. 
The level of bonuses payable on achievement of the targets is set at the level perceived correct to provide the necessary incentives for 
Executive Directors and Senior Managers. There are appropriate adjustments to the bonus payable in the event of over- or under-achievement 
of the Group against those targets. In addition, bonuses are adjusted for personal performance and the amount of bonus paid will reflect any 
substantial periods of absence or unavailability of the employee.
3. Share Options Scheme - The Company has in place a share option scheme covering all employees, under which share options are normally 
granted once a year. The exercise price of the options granted under the scheme is set equal to the market value of the Company's shares at 
the time of grant. The share option scheme is overseen by the Remuneration Committee which shall determine the terms under which eligible 
individuals may be invited to participate. The scheme is normally an approved scheme but may be unapproved in relation to certain individuals.
4. Pensions -There is a defined contribution scheme for all Executive Directors and employees. Benefits in kind are not pensionable.
