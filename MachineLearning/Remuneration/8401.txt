Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee are:
Paul Ranson (Chairman of the Remuneration Committee)
Thomas Casdagli (appointed 9 September 2013)
Michael Gatenby
Andrew Smith
The Company Secretary attends the meetings of the Remuneration Committee as secretary to the Remuneration Committee. The Chief

There were 6 Remuneration Committee meetings held during the year.

quoted on AIM; the Remuneration Committee is committed to use the Regulations to influence the Report and follow best practice where
appropriate.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on www.alliancepharma.co.uk
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee reviews and determines on behalf of the Board and shareholders of the Company the pay, benefits and
other terms of service of the Executive Directors of the Company and the broad pay strategy with respect to senior Company employees.
Remuneration Policy
The objective of the Company's remuneration policy is to attract and retain the directors and senior executives needed to run the
Company in a cost-effective manner.
The remuneration policy of the Company has four principal components:
1. Basic Salaries and Benefits in Kind - Basic salaries are determined by the Remuneration Committee bearing in mind the salaries
paid in AIM-listed and other small market capitalisation healthcare companies. Within that frame of reference, it is intended that pay
should be at or near the median level. Benefits in kind include the provision of company cars (or a salary alternative).
2. Bonuses - Bonuses are payable to staff according to the achievement by the Group of certain pre-determined earnings targets. The
level of bonuses payable on achievement of the targets is set at the level perceived appropriate to provide the necessary incentives for
Executive Directors and Senior Managers. There are appropriate adjustments to the bonus payable in the event of over- or under-
achievement of the Group against those targets. In addition, bonuses are adjusted for personal performance and the amount of bonus
paid will reflect any substantial periods of absence or unavailability of the employee.
3. Share Options Scheme - The Company has in place a share option scheme covering all employees, under which share options are
normally granted once a year. The exercise price of the options granted under the scheme is set equal to the market value of the
company's shares at the time of grant. The share option scheme is overseen by the Remuneration Committee which shall determine
the terms under which eligible individuals may be invited to participate. The scheme is normally an HMRC approved scheme but may
be unapproved in relation to certain individuals.
4. Pensions -There is a defined contribution scheme for all Executive Directors and employees. Only basic salaries are pensionable,
except in the case of Tony Booley, whose bonus is also pensionable.
