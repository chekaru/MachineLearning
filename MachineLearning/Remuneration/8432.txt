 Board report on remuneration
Board report on remuneration 35
The remuneration committee (the Committee ) determines the remuneration of the executive Directors and makes recommendations 
to the Board of any changes in terms and conditions of employment of executive Directors. The Committee consists of three Independent
non-executive Directors: Ken Clarke (Chairman), Neil Cross and Patrick Ponsolle. Jeff Harris and Stefano Pessina attend meetings in advisory
capacities but are not present when their own remuneration is discussed.
Remuneration policy
The aims of the Group's remuneration policy has been, and will continue to be, to: maximise the position of the Group in the European
healthcare sector by attracting, retaining and motivating the highest calibre of executive Directors and senior executives; and align the rewards
of those individuals with the interests of shareholders by linking part of the remuneration package to the performance of the Group.
In implementing the remuneration policy, the Committee has considered the principles in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance
issued by the UK Financial Services Authority with regard to Directors' remuneration.
In accordance with the remuneration policy, the remuneration of the executive Directors is made up of a combination of basic salary, annual
performance bonus, non-cash benefits, long-term incentive plan benefits, share options and pension arrangements, all of which are detailed
below. The executive Directors' remuneration is reviewed at the start of each calendar year. 
Employment agreements
Geoff Cooper, George Fairweather, Chris Etherington and Steve Duncan are employed within the Group under contracts that can be
terminated by either party with notice of 12 months. Ornella Barra, Jeff Harris and Stefano Pessina have employment agreements that can
be terminated by the Group with notice of 12 months or by each of them with notice of six months. There are provisions in the service
agreements for pay in lieu of current salary for the un-expired period of appointment or to cover the required notice period. 
Chris Etherington will be leaving the Group at the end of March 2003. By mutual agreement, this is before the date at the end of his notice
period and no payment in lieu of current salary will be made.
Non-executive Directors
Ken Clarke is the Deputy Chairman and senior non-executive Director and receives a fee of  120,000 per annum. The other non-executive
Directors are entitled to a fee ( 25,000 per annum in 2002 and  35,000 per annum with effect from January 2003). Ken Clarke and 
Neil Cross are each paid an additional fee of  5,000 per annum for chairing the remuneration and audit committees respectively. Neil Cross
and other members of the audit committee will each be paid an additional fee of  5,000 per annum with effect from January 2003. 
The fees paid reflect the time non-executive Directors are required to commit to their duties and amounts paid to non-executives in comparable
companies. The UK Board Index of the 150 largest quoted companies by market value published by Spencer Stuart was used to assess
comparability. The Board reviews these fees periodically and no Director is permitted to vote in respect of their own remuneration.
Non-executive Directors derive no other benefits from their office and are not eligible to participate in the Group's pension arrangements.
It is Company policy not to grant share options to non-executive Directors or to require part of their fees to be paid in the form of shares.
Salaries
The setting of basic salary reflects the Committee's assessment of the market rate for relevant positions taking into account the levels 
of responsibility, the individual Director's experience and their contribution to the business. For determining basic salary in 2002, the
Committee used a number of comparative remuneration surveys, the principal one being provided by Executive Remuneration Review
Limited (ERRL ). The ERRL survey comprised 95 companies, 27 of which were in the FTSE 100 index and 31 were in the FTSE mid-250
index, and comparability was measured against companies with a similar market capitalisation and similar turnover. For determining basic
salary in 2003, the Committee appointed and received advice from Monks Partnership. Monks Partnership does not provide any other
service to the Company. Where a Director is entitled to a benefit but chooses not to take that benefit, a supplement to the salary is paid 
in lieu of that benefit. The amount paid to each Director in 2002 is detailed in the emoluments section below.
Benefits
Other benefits available to Directors relate to the provision of company cars, private medical insurance, personal accident insurance, travel
insurance and, for Stefano Pessina, the cost of travel to and from work and accommodation while working for the Group in the UK. 
The provision of these benefits reflects market practice and is not related to performance. The value of these non-cash benefits for each
Director in 2002, including expenses chargeable to UK income tax, are detailed in the emoluments section below.
Annual performance bonuses
The annual performance bonus rewards executive Directors for the Group and individual divisions for which they are responsible achieving
their budgeted performance, after the cost of the bonuses. The payment also takes into account personal performance.  Board report on remuneration (continued)
36 Alliance UniChem Plc
In 2002, the budgeted performance was based on the challenging but achievable 2002 budget for earnings, before amortisation of
intangible assets, at constant exchange rates, agreed by the Board at the beginning of the year. Depending upon responsibilities, a bonus
of between 5% and 15% was payable for performance of 100% of the Group and divisional performance, rising to 40% for performance
of 105% of the Group and divisional budgeted performance.
Personal performance was based on a 360-degree appraisal process and determined by the remuneration committee. Depending on
responsibilities, a bonus of up to 15% was payable based on this appraisal and other factors. 
The maximum bonus an executive Director could receive was 50% of their basic salary. The amount due to each Director in respect 
of performance in 2002 is detailed in the emoluments section below.

Long-term incentive plan
The long-term incentive plan is a discretionary arrangement under which allocations are made to executive Directors with the aim of rewarding
them for creating shareholder value. Each allocation takes the form of a non-binding statement of intent to make an award of a stated
maximum amount following the end of a specified performance period. The allocation is determined as a percentage of basic salary in 
the year the performance period starts. The Directors' allocations outstanding at 10 March 2003 are:
2000 allocation 2001 allocation 2002 allocation 2003 allocation

Chris Etherington will be leaving the Group at the end of March 2003 and allocations previously made to him lapsed when he gave notice
to end his employment with the Group.
The performance periods for the allocations are:
2000 allocation 2001 allocation 2002 allocation 2003 allocation
Period start 1 January 2000 1 January 2001 1 January 2002 1 January 2003
Period end 31 December 2002 31 December 2003 31 December 2004 31 December 2005
The amount of the award is dependent on the achievement of certain performance measures during the performance period that the
remuneration committee believe are the most appropriate measure of the underlying performance of the Group. For 2000, 2001 and
2002, these measures are:
Performance measure Achievement % awarded
Total shareholder return below median -
at median (50%) 12.5
for every 1% above median +1.5
up to upper quartile (75%) 50.0
Earnings per share below RPI-x +3% -
at RPI-x +3% 5.0
for every 0.1% above RPI-x +3% +4.5
Up to RPI-x +4% 50.0
Total shareholder return measures the total return to shareholders in terms of share price growth and dividends reinvested in the shares 
of the Company over the performance period. Performance is compared with the same measure of performance for companies in the
FTSE 250. Earnings per share are defined as the diluted earnings per share before amortisation of intangibles, taxation and exceptional
items as reported for a full accounting year. RPI-x is the index of retail prices for all items excluding mortgage payments as published 
by the UK Government. The performance against RPI-x is calculated on a per annum compound basis.
For the 2003 allocation, the total shareholder return measure will be compared with the performance of companies in the FTSE 100, although
the committee intend to move to a more suitable European index. In addition, the earnings per share measure has been changed to:
Performance measure Achievement % awarded
Earnings per share below RPI-x +5% -
at RPI-x +5% 5.0
for every 0.1% above RPI-x +5% +4.5
Up to RPI-x +6% 50.0
The award takes the form of a right to acquire ordinary shares in the Company for a nominal sum within a period of ten years from 
the date of the award. The number of shares will be determined by the market price of the Company's shares at the date of the award.
The remuneration committee has the discretion to withhold or reduce awards to any extent it considers appropriate, having regard to 
the Group's underlying financial performance and irrespective of the level of attainment of the performance targets.
During 2002, awards were made on allocations with the performance period 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2001. During the performance
period, the Company was below the median in the comparator group on total shareholder return and the increase in earnings per share
was in excess of RPI-x +4%. On this basis, awards equivalent to 50% of the allocations were made and converted into share options at
609 pence per share, as follows:
Allocation Award nominal value Award share options
Director     number
J.F. Harris 192,500 96,250 15,804
S. Pessina 125,000 62,500 10,262

The awards are further detailed in the table of interests in share option schemes below.
Following the end of the performance period for the 2000 Allocation detailed above, the remuneration committee has recommended 
to the trustees of the 1992 Employee Trust that awards equivalent to 100% of the allocation are made. Their basis for doing this is that
during the performance period, the Company was in the 86th percentile of the comparator group on shareholder return and the increase
in earnings per share was in excess of RPI-x +4%.
Performance
Total shareholder return for the Company and total shareholder return for FTSE 250 companies, being the comparator group used for 
the long-term incentive plan, over the five years ending 31 December 2002 are: 
The mid-market price of shares of the Company ranged during 2002 between 672.5 pence on 13 June and 431.5 pence on 18 November
and at 31 December was 447.0 pence.
The increase in earnings per share over the five years ending 31 December 2002 compared to RPI-x +3% over the same period is:

was  273,000. 
The Company pays the additional money purchase contributions into separate schemes with no additional contributions from the Directors.
Any additional voluntary contributions paid by the Directors, and the benefit arising from such contributions, are excluded from the 
above table.
Under the arrangements of the pension scheme: the normal retirement age of the Directors is 60; Jeff Harris, on leaving service, is entitled
to receive an unreduced pension from age 55; Directors are required to pay a contribution of 5% of basic salary; a spouse's pension of 
one half of the Director's pension is payable on death after retirement; a statutory minimum pension for the legal widow and the Director's
