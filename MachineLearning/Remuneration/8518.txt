Directors' remuneration report
The information contained in this report has been audited 
by KPMG Audit Plc to the extent required by the Companies 
Act 1985.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a committee of independent 
Non-Executive Directors, the members of which are: Donald
Brydon (Chairman), Bruno Angelici, Sir Ross Buckland, Peter
Jacobs and Gerry Robinson. David Malpas was Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee until his retirement from the Board
on 20 October 2003. The Committee establishes the terms of
employment and remuneration for the Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee has appointed Deloitte & T ouche
LLP as its executive remuneration advisers and Linklaters as its
legal advisers. Deloitte & T ouche has also provided financial and IT
consulting services to the Group during the year ended 31 August
2003 and Linklaters act as one of the Group's corporate legal
advisers. The Chief Executive normally attends meetings of the
Remuneration Committee and assists the Committee on matters
relating to the other Executive Directors' performance and
remuneration; he does not participate in decisions regarding 
his own remuneration. Additionally, the Remuneration Committee
is materially assisted by the Group's Secretariat and Human
Resources functions.
Remuneration policy
This report sets out the Company's policy on Directors'
remuneration. It is currently intended that this policy will continue 
to apply to each Executive Director for the year ending 31 August
2004 and, subject to review, for subsequent years.
Allied Domecq operates in global and highly competitive markets. 
With over 90% of trading profit generated outside the UK and 
over half of trading profit derived in the Americas it is vital that the
Company operates a remuneration policy appropriate to its global
executive talent pool.
Accordingly, the Remuneration Policy is designed to provide
remuneration which:
  T akes account of practice in the relevant markets
  Aligns the interests of executives with those of shareholders 
by placing heavy emphasis on the linkage between pay and
sustained business performance
  Provides a high proportion of total reward in Allied Domecq 
shares delivered over a number of years.
The Group's reward strategy is for base salaries and benefits 
including pensions (or cash allowances paid in lieu of benefits) 
to reflect the relevant market median position and for total
compensation to be performance-driven to higher than market 
median levels as appropriate. This strategy is consistent with the
Group's belief that performance should determine a significant
proportion of the total remuneration package for all employees
(including Executive Directors). 
The fees of the independent Non-Executive Directors (including 
the independent Chairman) are determined by the Board as 
a whole within the overall amount authorised by shareholders.
Directors do not participate in decisions regarding their own
remuneration. The fees paid to independent Non-Executive
Directors are designed to recognise the significant responsibilities
of Directors and to attract individuals with the necessary
experience and ability to make an important contribution to the
Group's affairs. The fees, which are neither performance-related
nor pensionable, are comparable with those paid by other FTSE
100 companies. Non-Executive Directors do not receive any share
options or long term incentive awards.
Remuneration
Proportion of total remuneration
The relative importance of fixed and performance-related
remuneration for the Executive Directors based on the
remuneration policy set out in this report is broadly as follows:
Base Performance-
salary/ related Long Term
benefits bonuses Incentives Total
All Executive Directors 25-30% 35-40% 30-45% 100%
Note:
(1) The above information is based on current base salaries and other benefits,
maximum potential bonus payments and associated maximum deferral/matching
of bonuses and expected value for long term incentives. It excludes pension
benefits or pension allowances paid in lieu thereof and participation in all-
employee share plans.
Base salary 
Salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed annually on 
1 January of each year , taking into consideration the pay levels 
in a comparator group of approximately 20 other international
FMCG companies of a size and complexity relevant to that 
of Allied Domecq.

Pensions
The Company recognises that pension provision is an important
component of total remuneration. David Scotland and Graham
Hetherington are eligible for a pension from the Allied Domecq
Pension Fund, subject to the UK Inland Revenue Earnings Cap.
Executive Directors who have joined the Group since 1998 have
not been invited to join the Fund. As a result of this policy, Philip
Bowman is not a member of the Fund and hence accrues no
pension benefits. T o the extent that Executive Directors receive
salary that is not pensionable, they are paid an allowance in lieu 
of pension benefits.
Details of the accrued pension benefits of those Executive
Directors who participate in the Company's non-contributory
pension scheme are shown on page 49. Details of allowances 
paid in lieu of pensions are reported in the Directors' Remuneration
table shown on page 48. 
Benefits
Benefits include the provision of private health, life and other
insurances, car allowances, pension allowances for those
Directors who do not participate in the Company sponsored
pension plans or whose benefits under the Company plans are
limited by the UK Inland Revenue Earnings Cap, business-related
partner travel costs and certain other minor benefits. These
benefits do not form part of pensionable earnings.
Performance-related bonuses
The Company operates a Deferred Bonus Plan for the Executive
Directors and certain other senior executives. The Remuneration
Committee sets performance targets annually based on relevant
market measures and, for the year ended 31 August 2003, the
bonuses were based on earnings per share growth and
completion of key management and business objectives. 
The bonus payable to participants in respect of the year was the
equivalent of 14% of their annual base salary for every 1% of real
growth in the Company's normalised earnings per share (adjusted 
by the Remuneration Committee to measure underlying business
performance). The maximum bonus receivable based on earnings 
per share growth was 80% of base salary.
An additional bonus of up to 20% of salary was available under 
the plan on the achievement of certain key management and 
business objectives. 
The level of bonus achievable under the plan is commensurate 
with the much more demanding economic conditions in many 
of the relevant markets.
In order to promote share ownership and to aid retention, 25% 
of the bonus awarded is automatically, and up to a further 25% 
of the bonus awarded may be voluntarily, deferred and invested 
in Allied Domecq shares, which are forfeitable under certain
circumstances. A matching award of an equal number of shares 
is awarded subject to the executive remaining in employment. 
For the year ended 31 August 2003, 50% of the shares are
released to the executive after two years and the remaining 50% 
of the shares are released to the executive after three years. 
The matching award is not subject to the achievement of any
further performance conditions because it relates to the deferred
element of a bonus which has already been earned.
Long Term Incentives
The Executive Directors participate in the Group's Executive 
Share Option Schemes and Long T erm Incentive Scheme. 
When determining awards under the Schemes, the Remuneration
Committee takes account of the role and responsibility of the
individual and relevant market practice. In accordance with market
practice, awards are currently made annually.
At the time of grant the combined awards have an expected value 
of up to 2 x base salary for the Chief Executive and up to 1 x base
salary for all other Executive Directors. Expected value is currently
calculated at 22.5% of face value for options granted under the
executive share option schemes and 40% of face value for awards
under the Long T erm Incentive Scheme. 
The performance conditions selected by the Remuneration
Committee for the Executive Share Option Schemes and the Long
T erm Incentive Scheme are designed to be challenging, to align
the interests of management with those of the shareholders and
were agreed following extensive consultation with shareholder
representative bodies. 
Executive Share Option Schemes
The Group operates Executive Share Option Schemes for
Executive Directors, other senior executives and other employees
for exceptional performance. The schemes are the Inland Revenue
Approved Executive Share Option Scheme 1999, the Executive
Share Option Scheme 1999 (incorporating US Schedule) and the
Share Appreciation Rights Plan 1999. The Executive Share Option
Schemes provide for the grant of options or share appreciation
rights at an exercise price of not less than market value which
under normal circumstances remain exercisable between the third
and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant (though shorter life
options or share appreciation rights may be granted under certain
of the Schemes). The Remuneration Committee sets performance
conditions that must be met before the options or share
appreciation rights become exercisable. 
During the year ended 31 August 2003, options were granted 
with a face value of 275% of base salary to the Chief Executive 
and 175% of base salary at the date of grant to all other 
Executive Directors. Options granted during the year ended 
31 August 2000 are exercisable if the T otal Shareholder Return
(share price growth plus gross dividends re-invested) performance
of Allied Domecq equals or exceeds the median T otal Shareholder
Return achieved by the constituents of the FTSE 100 Index over
any consecutive three year period between the dates of grant 
and exercise. This performance condition has been achieved 
and the options are therefore exercisable.  46
Directors' remuneration report
All options granted since 1 September 2000 become exercisable 
if Allied Domecq's growth in normalised earnings per share exceeds
the growth in the UK retail prices index (excluding mortgage interest)
by 9% over three years. If the performance condition is not met
over the three years following the grant of options, the condition 
is re-tested after four years and, if necessary, again after five years,
with a consequent increase in earnings per share growth to 
12% over four years or 15% over five years. If the performance
condition is not met after five years, the options will lapse. When
considering the achievement of the performance conditions, the
Remuneration Committee has the discretion to adjust normalised
earnings per share to measure the underlying business
performance of the Group. 
Long Term Incentive Scheme
Under the Long T erm Incentive Scheme 1999 awards are made 
to the Executive Directors and certain other senior executives,
subject to the achievement of performance conditions set by 
the Remuneration Committee at award.
During the year ended 31 August 2003, awards were made 
under the Long T erm Incentive Scheme with a face value of 200% 
of base salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of base salary 
to all other Executive Directors. 
These awards are subject to Allied Domecq's T otal Shareholder
Return performance over a three year period relative to a
comparator group of companies. No shares will be delivered
unless T otal Shareholder Return is at or above median of the
comparator group and for performance at the median of the
comparator group 40% of the shares can be earned. The full
number of shares can only be earned if the T otal Shareholder
Return is at or above upper quartile. For performance that is
between median and upper quartile the number of shares that 
vest is determined on a straight line basis. In addition, awards 
will only vest if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that
underlying financial performance is satisfactory.
The comparator groups for the various awards under the Long
T erm Incentive Scheme comprise the following companies from
the food, drink and tobacco industries:
Years ended 31 August 2001 and 2002
Associated British Foods SAB Miller
Six Continents 
(1)
Scottish & Newcastle
British American T obacco T ate & Lyle
Cadbury Schweppes Uniq 
(2)
Diageo Unilever
Gallaher Group Whitbread
Imperial T obacco
Year ended 31 August 2003
In order to reflect more appropriately the competitive set of global
companies with which Allied Domecq competes for business and
its executive talent, the Remuneration Committee decided to
expand the above comparator group to include the following
additional international FMCG companies for the awards made
under the Long T erm Incentive Scheme in the year ended 
31 August 2003: 
Anheuser-Busch Kellogg
Brown-Forman Pernod Ricard
Carlsberg Philip Morris
Heineken Procter and Gamble
Nestl 
Notes:
(1) Following the demerger of Six Continents, the methodology followed to 
track TSR performance has been to synthesise the effect of the transaction. 
On demerger , Six Continents' shareholders received 50 Mitchells and Butlers
(MAB) shares, 50 Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG) shares and 81p in cash
for every 59 Six Continents shares held. The cash payment has been applied 
as a special dividend reinvested equally in shares of MAB and IHG. For future
awards, Six Continents is to replaced in the comparator group by Mitchells 
and Butlers.
(2) Uniq is only included in the comparator group for the awards made during the
year ended 31 August 2001 .
Based on the current performance conditions, it looks unlikely that
the options awarded under the Long T erm Incentive Scheme will
vest and deliver the expected 40% of face value despite the very
favourable total shareholder return performance of the Company
relative to the FTSE 100 Index illustrated in the graph on page 47.
All-employee share plans
The Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the other
share plans that are open to all employees in certain jurisdictions.
These plans are the SAYE plans, namely the SAYE Scheme 1999,
the International SAYE Scheme 1999 and the United States Share
Purchase Plan, and the Share Partnership Plan. The SAYE plans
offer savings contracts and the right to buy shares with the
projected savings proceeds at an exercise price of not less than
80% of the market value of the shares at grant. The Share
Partnership Plan is an Inland Revenue approved share incentive
plan; eligible employees may purchase shares on a monthly basis
from gross pay and the Company matches their investment on 
a one for four basis. As is normal practice for share plans that 
are open to all employees, performance conditions do not apply 
to the all-employee share plans. 
Service agreements
Executive Directors
Details of the Executive Directors' service agreements are 
as follows:
Agreement Unexpired Notice 
date term period
P Bowman 20 October 2003 Rolling 12 months 12 months
G Hetherington 20 October 2003 Rolling 12 months 12 months
D Scotland 20 October 2003 Rolling 12 months 12 months
R Turner 20 October 2003 Rolling 12 months 12 months 47
The Executive Directors previously had service agreements
requiring not less than 24 months' notice of termination to be 
given by either party. The Remuneration Committee reviewed 
this policy in October 2003 and it was agreed that the Executive
Directors would enter into new service agreements requiring 
not less than 12 months' notice of termination to be given by 
either party. 
The current service agreements contain provisions for
compensation to be payable to the Directors upon early
termination of employment without cause (i.e. without a reason 
or reasons otherwise entitling the Company to terminate an
Executive Director's employment in accordance with the terms 
of the agreement). Such compensation broadly provides for 
the payment to an Executive Director whose employment is
terminated without cause of a sum equal to 95% of annual 
base salary, contractual benefits and bonuses.
Non-Executive Directors
The independent Non-Executive Directors (including the
independent Chairman) do not have service agreements 
with the Company. It is the policy of the Company to appoint 
Non-Executive Directors for an initial period of three years
renewable for a further period of three years, subject to election
and re-election by shareholders in general meeting. The Board 
has to ratify any further period of appointment after this six year
period. Following completion of his second three year term,
Donald Brydon has been re-appointed by the Board for a further
period of one year , subject to annual re-appointment by the Board
thereafter . The Chairman has a letter of appointment dated 
29 January 2002 which requires not less than 12 months' 
notice of termination to be given by either party.
External appointments
Allied Domecq encourages its Executive Directors to serve 
as Non-Executive Directors of other leading companies subject 
to such appointments being conducive to their personal
development, the time spent being reasonable and there being 
no conflict of interest. The policy relating to fees is that generally
the Director may retain the fees; as such positions entail personal
responsibility on their part.
Performance graph
The graph below shows Allied Domecq's T otal Shareholder Return
for the five years to 31 August 2003 measured against the T otal
Shareholder Return of the FTSE 100 Index for the same period. 
As Allied Domecq has been a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index
for nearly the whole of this five year period, that index is considered
to be the most appropriate benchmark.

Notes:
(1) Donald Brydon's fee as Senior Independent Non-Executive Director includes his roles as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and Chairman of the Allied Domecq 
pensions trusts. 
(2) Payments to former Directors in 2002 include  1 ,991 ,000 in respect of compensation for loss of office reported in 2002.
(3) Philip Bowman is not a member of any Allied Domecq pension scheme. Both Graham Hetherington and David Scotland are members of the Allied Domecq Executives Pension
Fund but their pension benefits only relate to that part of their salary up to the Inland Revenue Earnings Cap (currently  99,000 per annum).
(4) The performance-related bonus figures shown above include the deferred and matching elements of the bonus that are received in shares. The deferred bonus shares are 
forfeitable in certain circumstances and 50% of the deferred bonus shares are released to the executive after two years and the remaining 50% of the deferred bonus shares 
are released to the executive after three years. It should be noted that the matching shares are conditional, except under exceptional circumstances, on continued employment 
with the Group and therefore a significant amount of the performance-related bonus reported in the table above is not received by the Director until the end of the deferral period
that operates under the Deferred Bonus Plan. A breakdown of the total bonuses reported is as follows:

Cash award (Audited)
In November 2002, the Remuneration Committee made awards of deferred cash bonuses to certain senior executives including the four
Executive Directors. These awards were made to take the place of grants of options under the Long T erm Incentive Scheme which would have
been made but in the event could not properly be made because of consolidation activity in the industry. In making these awards the
Remuneration Committee took account of the value created for shareholders. The structure of the award has been designed to retain those
executives who are eligible to receive the awards. The award was equal to 100% of base salary as at 1 January 2003. The payment of the award
is subject to the executive remaining in employment on the payment dates. Half of the award was paid on 1 September 2003 and the other half
will be paid on 1 September 2004.
