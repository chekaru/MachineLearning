Directors' remuneration report
The information contained in this report has been audited by KPMG
Audit Plc to the extent required by the Companies Act 1985.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a committee of independent Non-
Executive Directors, the members of which are: Donald Brydon
(Chairman), Paul Adams, Bruno Angelici, John Rishton and Sir Gerry
Robinson. The Committee establishes the terms of employment and
remuneration for the Executive Directors and the Chairman.
The Remuneration Committee has appointed Kepler Associates as 
its executive remuneration advisers and Linklaters as its legal advisers.
Kepler Associates provides no other services to the Company;
Linklaters also acts as one of the Group's corporate legal advisers. 
The Chief Executive normally attends meetings of the Remuneration
Committee and assists the Committee on matters relating to the other
Executive Directors' performance and remuneration; he does not
participate in decisions regarding his own remuneration. Additionally,
the Remuneration Committee is materially assisted by the Group's
Corporate Secretariat and Human Resources functions.
Remuneration policy
This report sets out the Company's policy on Directors' remuneration.
During the year the Remuneration Committee has conducted a review
of the long term incentive arrangements for the Group's senior
executives. This review has been designed to maintain essentially the
same overall level of remuneration. Details of the proposed changes
are included below.
Allied Domecq operates in global and highly competitive markets. 
With over 90% of trading profit generated outside the UK and over 
half of trading profit derived in the Americas, it is vital that the Company
operates a remuneration policy appropriate to its global executive
talent pool.
Accordingly, the Remuneration policy is designed to provide
remuneration which:
 T akes account of practice in the relevant markets;
  Aligns the interests of executives with those of Shareholders by
placing heavy emphasis on the linkage between pay and sustained
business performance; and
 Provides a high proportion of total reward in Allied Domecq shares
delivered over a number of years.
The Group's reward strategy is for base salaries and benefits 
including pensions (or cash allowances paid in lieu of benefits) 
to reflect the relevant market median position and for total
compensation to be performance-driven to higher than market 
median levels as appropriate. This strategy is consistent with the
Group's belief that performance should determine a significant
proportion of the total remuneration package for all employees
(including Executive Directors). 
The fees of the independent Non-Executive Directors (excluding 
the Chairman) are determined by the Board as a whole, on the
recommendation of the Executive Directors, within the overall amount
authorised by Shareholders. Directors do not participate in decisions
regarding their own remuneration. The fees paid to independent 
Non-Executive Directors are designed to recognise the significant
responsibilities of Directors and to attract individuals with the
necessary experience and ability to make an important contribution 
to the Group's affairs. The fees, which are neither performance-related
nor pensionable, are comparable with those paid by other FTSE 100
companies. Non-Executive Directors do not receive any share options
or long term incentive awards.
Remuneration
Proportion of total remuneration
The relative importance of fixed and performance-related remuneration
for the Executive Directors based on the remuneration policy set out in
this report is broadly as follows:
Base Performance-
salary/ related Long Term
benefits bonuses Incentives Total
All Executive Directors 28-34% 26-32% 30-45% 100%
Note
(1) The above information is based on current base salaries and other benefits, maximum
potential bonus payments and associated maximum deferral/matching of bonuses 
and expected value for long-term incentives. It excludes pension benefits or pension
allowances paid in lieu thereof and participation in all-employee share plans.
Base salary 
Salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed annually on 
1 January of each year , taking into consideration the pay levels 
in a comparator group of approximately 20 other international 
FMCG companies of a size and complexity relevant to that 
of Allied Domecq.

Pensions
The Company recognises that pension provision is an important
component of total remuneration. David Scotland and Graham
Hetherington are eligible for a pension from the Allied Domecq
Pension Fund, subject to the UK Inland Revenue Earnings Cap.
Executive Directors who have joined the Group since 1998 have not
been invited to join the Fund. As a result of this policy, Philip Bowman
is not a member of the Fund and hence accrues no pension benefits.
To the extent that Executive Directors receive salary that is not
pensionable, they are paid an allowance in lieu of pension benefits.
Details of the accrued pension benefits of those Executive Directors
who participate in the Company's non-contributory pension scheme
are shown on page 51. Details of allowances paid in lieu of pensions
are reported in the Directors' Remuneration table shown on page 50. 
Benefits
Benefits include the provision of private health, life and other
insurances, car allowances, pension allowances for those Directors
who do not participate in the Company-sponsored pension plans or
whose benefits under the Company plans are limited by the UK Inland
Revenue Earnings Cap, business-related partner travel costs and
certain other minor benefits. These benefits do not form part of
pensionable earnings.
Performance-related bonuses
The Company operates a Deferred Bonus Plan for the Executive
Directors and certain other senior executives. The Remuneration
Committee sets performance targets annually based on relevant
market measures and, for the year ended 31 August 2004, the
bonuses were based on earnings per share growth and completion 
of key management and business objectives. 
The bonus payable to participants in respect of the year was the
equivalent of 14% of their annual base salary for every 1 % of real
growth in the Company's normalised earnings per share (adjusted 
by the Remuneration Committee to measure underlying business
performance). The maximum bonus receivable based on earnings 
per share growth was 80% of base salary. 
An additional bonus of up to 20% of salary was available under
the Plan on the achievement of certain key management and 
business objectives. 
In order to promote share ownership and to aid retention, 25% 
of the bonus awarded is automatically, and up to a further 25% 
of the bonus awarded may be voluntarily, deferred and invested 
in Allied Domecq shares, which are forfeitable under certain
circumstances. A matching award of an equal number of shares 
is awarded subject to the executive remaining in employment. 50% 
of the shares are released to the executive after two years and the
remaining 50% of the shares are released to the executive after three
years. The matching award is not subject to the achievement of any
further performance conditions because it relates to the deferred
element of a bonus which has already been earned.
Long Term Incentives
The Executive Directors currently participate in the Group's Executive
Share Option Schemes and Long T erm Incentive Scheme. When
determining awards under the Schemes the Remuneration Committee
takes account of the role and responsibility of the individual and
relevant market practice. In accordance with market practice, awards
are currently made annually.
At the time of grant the combined awards have an expected value 
of up to 2 x base salary for the Chief Executive and up to 1 x base salary
for all other Executive Directors. Expected value for awards made
during the year ended 31 August 2004 was calculated at 22.5% 
of face value for options granted under the Executive Share Option
Schemes and 40% of face value for awards under the Long T erm
Incentive Scheme. 
The performance conditions selected by the Remuneration 
Committee for the Executive Share Option Schemes and the 
Long T erm Incentive Scheme are designed to be challenging, 
to align the interests of management with those of the Shareholders
and were agreed following extensive consultation with Shareholder
representative bodies. 
Executive Share Option Schemes
The Group operates Executive Share Option Schemes for 
Executive Directors, other senior executives and other employees 
for exceptional performance. The Schemes are the Inland Revenue
Approved Executive Share Option Scheme 1999, the Executive 
Share Option Scheme 1999 (incorporating US Schedule) and the
Share Appreciation Rights Plan 1999. The Executive Share Option
Schemes provide for the grant of options or share appreciation 
rights at an exercise price of not less than market value which under
normal circumstances remain exercisable between the third and 
tenth anniversaries of the date of grant (though shorter life options 
or share appreciation rights may be granted under certain of the
Schemes). The Remuneration Committee sets performance 
conditions that must be met before the options or share 
appreciation rights become exercisable. 
During the year ended 31 August 2004, options were granted with 
a face value of 275% of base salary to the Chief Executive and 175% 
of base salary at the date of grant to all other Executive Directors.
Options become exercisable if Allied Domecq's growth in normalised
earnings per share exceeds the growth in the UK retail prices index
(excluding mortgage interest) by 9% over three years. If the
performance condition is not met over the three years following 
the grant of options, the condition is re-tested after four years and, 
if necessary, again after five years, with a consequent increase 
in earnings per share growth to 12% over four years or 15% over 
five years. If the performance condition is not met after five years, 
the options will lapse. 
As a result of the Remuneration Committee's review of long term
incentive arrangements, it is proposed to replace the grant of options
under the Executive Share Option Schemes with the award of
conditional shares under a new Performance Share Plan. Introduction
of the new Plan is subject to Shareholder approval at the Company's
AGM to be held on 28 January 2005 and a detailed summary 
of the plan is contained in the Chairman's Letter to Shareholders
accompanying this Annual Report and Accounts. Vesting of
conditional awards under the Plan will be subject to Allied Domecq's
annualised growth in normalised earnings per share exceeding the
growth in the UK retail prices index (excluding mortgage interest) 
over three years, according to the following schedule:
3% real EPS growth per annum 20% vesting
7% real EPS growth per annum 100% vesting
For performance that is between 3% and 7% real EPS growth 
per annum, the number of shares that vest is determined on a straight
line basis. 48
Directors' remuneration report
There is no performance re-testing under the new Plan.
When considering the achievement of the performance conditions
under both the Executive Share Option Schemes and the new
Performance Share Plan, the Remuneration Committee has the
discretion to adjust earnings per share to measure the underlying
business performance of the Group.
Long Term Incentive Scheme
Under the Long T erm Incentive Scheme 1999, awards are made 
to the Executive Directors and certain other senior executives, subject
to the achievement of performance conditions set by the Remuneration
Committee at award.
During the year ended 31 August 2004, awards were made under 
the Long T erm Incentive Scheme with a face value of 200% of base
salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of base salary to all other
Executive Directors. 
These awards are subject to Allied Domecq's T otal Shareholder
Return performance over a three-year period relative to a comparator
group of companies. No shares will be delivered unless T otal
Shareholder Return is above median of the comparator group and 
for performance at the median of the comparator group 40% of the
shares can be earned. The full number of shares can only be earned 
if the T otal Shareholder Return is at or above upper quartile. For
performance that is between median and upper quartile the number 
of shares that vest is determined on a straight line basis. In addition,
awards will only vest if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that
underlying financial performance is satisfactory. As a result of the
Remuneration Committee's review of long term incentive arrangements,
for the year ending 31 August 2005 the number of shares that can 
be earned for median performance is being reduced to 20% of the
number initially awarded. In addition, it is proposed to amend the
Scheme rules to result in the accrual of dividends on shares earned.
This amendment is subject to Shareholder approval at the Company's
AGM to be held on 28 January 2005.
The comparator groups for the various awards under the Long 
Term Incentive Scheme comprise the following companies from 
the FMCG sector:
Year ended 31 August 2002
Associated British Foods Imperial T obacco
Six Continents 
(1)
Scottish & Newcastle
British American T obacco SAB Miller
Cadbury Schweppes T ate & Lyle
Diageo Unilever
Gallaher Group Whitbread
Years ended 31 August 2003 and 2004
Altria Group Kellogg
Anheuser-Busch Nestl 
Associated British Foods Pernod Ricard
British American T obacco Procter and Gamble
Brown Forman SAB Miller
Cadbury Schweppes Scottish & Newcastle
Carlsberg Six Continents/Mitchells and Butlers 
(1)
Diageo T ate & Lyle
Gallaher Group Unilever
Heineken Whitbread
Imperial Tobacco
Note
(1) Following the demerger of Six Continents, the methodology followed to track TSR
performance has been to synthesise the effect of the transaction. On demerger , 
Six Continents shareholders received 50 Mitchells and Butlers (MAB) shares, 50
Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG) shares and 81 pence in cash for every 59 Six
Continents shares held. The cash payment has been applied as a special dividend
reinvested equally in shares of MAB and IHG. For awards made during the year
ended 31 August 2004, Six Continents was replaced in the comparator group 
by Mitchells and Butlers.
It is currently intended that the current comparator group, as described
above, will be the comparator group used for future awards under the
Long T erm Incentive Scheme.
Despite the very strong TSR performance of the Company relative 
to the FTSE 100 Index over the past five years, illustrated on the graph
on page 49, the options granted under the Long T erm Incentive
Scheme in May 2001 did not vest.
All-employee share plans
The Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the other
share plans that are open to all employees in certain jurisdictions.
These plans are the SAYE plans, namely the SAYE Scheme 1999, 
the International SAYE Scheme 1999 and the United States Share
Purchase Plan, and the Share Partnership Plan. The SAYE plans 
offer savings contracts and the right to buy shares with the projected
savings proceeds at an exercise price of not less than 80% of the
market value of the shares at grant. There have been no options
granted under the SAYE plans since those granted during the year
ended 31 August 2002. The Share Partnership Plan is an Inland
Revenue approved share incentive plan; eligible employees may
purchase shares on a monthly basis from gross pay and the Company
matches their investment on a one-for-four basis. As is normal practice
for share plans that are open to all employees, performance conditions
do not apply to the all-employee share plans. 
Service agreements
Executive Directors
Details of the Executive Directors' service agreements are as follows:
Agreement Unexpired Notice 
date term period
Philip Bowman 20 October 2003 Rolling 12 months 12 months
Graham 
Hetherington 20 October 2003 Rolling 12 months 12 months
David Scotland 20 October 2003 Rolling 12 months 12 months
Richard T urner 20 October 2003 Rolling 12 months 12 months 49
The Executive Directors previously had service agreements requiring
not less than 24 months' notice of termination to be given by either
party. The Remuneration Committee reviewed this policy in October
2003 and it was agreed that the Executive Directors would enter into
new service agreements requiring not less than 12 months' notice of
termination to be given by either party. 
The current service agreements contain provisions for compensation
to be payable to the Directors upon early termination of employment
without cause (ie without a reason or reasons otherwise entitling 
the Company to terminate an Executive Director's employment in
accordance with the terms of the agreement). Such compensation
broadly provides for the payment to an Executive Director whose
employment is terminated without cause of a sum equal to 95% 
of annual base salary, contractual benefits and bonuses.
Non-Executive Directors
The independent Non-Executive Directors (including the independent
Chairman) do not have service agreements with the Company. It is the
policy of the Company to appoint Non-Executive Directors for an initial
period of three years renewable for a further period of three years,
subject to election and re-election by Shareholders in general meeting.
The Board has to ratify any further period of appointment after this 
six-year period. Following completion of his second three-year term,
Donald Brydon has been reappointed by the Board on an annual basis. 
The Chairman has a letter of appointment dated 29 January 2002
which requires not less than 12 months' notice of termination to be
given by either party.
External appointments
Allied Domecq encourages its Executive Directors to serve as 
Non-Executive Directors of other leading companies subject to such
appointments being conducive to their personal development, the time
spent being reasonable and there being no conflict of interest. The
policy relating to fees is that generally the Director may retain the fees,
as such positions entail personal responsibility on their part. 
Performance graph
The graph below shows Allied Domecq's T otal Shareholder Return 
for the five years to 31 August 2004 measured against the T otal
Shareholder Return of the FTSE 100 Index for the same period. 
As Allied Domecq has been a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index 
for nearly the whole of this five-year period, that index is considered 
to be the most appropriate benchmark.

Notes
(1) Paul Adam's fee as Non-Executive Director is paid directly to his principal employer , British American T obacco p.l.c.
(2) Donald Brydon's fee as Senior Independent Non-Executive Director includes his roles as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and Chairman of the Allied Domecq 
pensions trusts. 
(3) The  Payment to former Director' is in respect of a phantom arrangement related to the share options of George McCarthy who retired as a Director on 29 February 2000.
(4) Philip Bowman is not a member of any Allied Domecq pension scheme. Both Graham Hetherington and David Scotland are members of the Allied Domecq Executives Pension
Fund but their pension benefits only relate to that part of their salary up to the Inland Revenue Earnings Cap (currently  102,000 per annum).
(5) The performance-related bonus figures shown above include the deferred and matching elements of the bonus that are received in shares. The deferred bonus shares are forfeitable
in certain circumstances and 50% of the deferred bonus shares are released to the executive after two years and the remaining 50% of the deferred bonus shares are released to
the executive after three years. It should be noted that the matching shares are conditional, except under exceptional circumstances, on continued employment with the Group and
therefore a significant amount of the performance-related bonus reported in the table above is not received by the Director until the end of the deferral period that operates under the
Deferred Bonus Plan. A breakdown of the total bonuses reported is as follows:

Notes
(1) At 31 August 2004 the Allied Domecq employee trusts held 27,073,905 (2003: 32,549,067) unallocated Ordinary Shares* in the Company on discretionary terms for the benefit 
of certain Group employees. The Executive Directors were treated as interested in these shares in their capacity as potential beneficiaries. As at 20 October 2004 these holdings 
had reduced to 26,183,923 Ordinary Shares*. 
(2) The above table includes interests in deferred bonus shares awarded under the Company's Deferred Bonus Plan and partnership shares purchased pursuant to the Company's 
Share Partnership Plan and associated matching shares. The Directors beneficially own such shares, however certain of these shares are forfeitable in specific circumstances. 
The table excludes interests in matching shares under the Company's Deferred Bonus Plan and interests in the Company's Share Option and Long T erm Incentive Schemes
disclosed on pages 52 and 53. 
(3) Philip Bowman purchased a further 66 shares and Richard T urner purchased a further 181 shares between 1 September 2004 and 20 October 2004. No Director had 
a non-beneficial interest in shares or stocks of the Company at any time either during the year ended 31 August 2004 or between 1 September 2004 and 20 October 2004.
* Includes American Depositary Shares representing underlying Ordinary Shares.
As a result of the Remuneration Committee's review of long term incentive arrangements, the Committee has introduced guidelines under which 
the Executive Directors are expected to build up significant personal holdings of Allied Domecq shares. We believe this will further align their
interests with those of Shareholders. The guidelines are 2 x salary for the Chief Executive and 1 x salary for other Executive Directors. 52

Cash award (audited)
As reported last year , in November 2002, the Remuneration Committee made awards of deferred cash bonuses to certain senior executives
including the four Executive Directors. These awards were made to take the place of grants of options under the Long T erm Incentive Scheme 
which would have been made but in the event could not properly be made because of consolidation activity in the industry. In making these awards
the Remuneration Committee took account of the value created for Shareholders. The structure of the award has been designed to retain those
executives who are eligible to receive the awards. The award was equal to 100% of base salary as at 1 January 2003. The payment of the award
was subject to the executive remaining in employment on the payment dates. Half of the award was paid on 1 September 2003 and the other half
was paid on 1 September 2004.
