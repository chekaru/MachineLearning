REMUNERATION POLICY
The policy of the Group is to provide levels of remuneration that attract, motivate and retain Executive Directors of the high calibre 
required to achieve the Group's demanding profitability and growth objectives and to reward them for enhancing shareholder value.

  Basic annual salary;
  Annual performance-related bonus;
  Pension contribution and benefits in kind;
  Share option awards; and 
  A Long-Term Retention Plan for the CEO
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
Basic annual salary
Salaries and bonuses are reviewed annually at the start of each financial year. Salaries are paid as a fixed cash sum monthly. They are 
designed to be competitive with salaries for similar levels of responsibility and achievement in comparable companies. 
A 3% increase in basic salary was awarded in 2014. A 3% increase for the Executive Directors is planned for 2015.
Annual performance-related bonus
The Company's policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of Executive Directors should be performance related. The 
total bonus pool is related to the total planned profit for the year.
The bonus elements are dependent on the Executive Directors achieving performance criteria set out by the Remuneration Committee. 
In 2014 the bonus was dependent on meeting demanding half yearly revenue and profit plans. 
For 2015 the bonus will be dependent on meeting demanding half yearly revenue and profit plans.
Pension contribution and benefits in kind
I J Bowles and A A Swann receive a pension contribution of 10% of basic salary. I J Bowles, A A Swann and C D Gale receive benefits in 
kind of car allowance, private medical cover and life cover. The value of the pension contributions and benefits in kind is shown in the 
table of Directors' remuneration on page 20 and 21.
SHARE OPTIONS
Share Option Plans
During the year ended 31 May 2014 there were five option schemes in operation: the Manpower Software plc Unapproved Executive 
Share Option Scheme; the Manpower Software plc Enterprise Management Scheme (an EMI scheme); the Allocate Software 2010 
Executive Share Option Scheme (a CSOP scheme); the Allocate Software 2010 Unapproved Share Option Scheme; and the Allocate 
Software plc 2014 Bonus Option Scheme. With the exception of the Allocate Software 2014 Bonus Option Scheme, the options vest 
three years after award conditional on meeting earnings per share (EPS ) targets. The options in the Allocate Software 2014 Bonus 
Option Scheme vest one year after award and are not conditional on earnings per share targets.
During the year ended 31 May 2014, the Board decided to revise the EPS targets for options granted after 1 January 2011. The targets 
have been reduced to reflect the transition of the business model to one where a greater proportion of revenues are recurring resulting 
in a slower growth in earnings per share. Please see further details in Note 18 of the Financial Statements on page 51.
During 2012, the Company announced that the Board had, following consultation with the Company's major shareholders, established a 
new long-term incentive and retention plan (LTRP ) for its CEO, I J Bowles (the Allocate Software plc 2011 Long-Term Retention Plan). 
Remuneration report 20
Remuneration report continued
Under this plan, I J Bowles was awarded 1,000,000 nil-price options over Ordinary Shares in the Company which will vest between 
September 2014 and September 2016 subject to (a) the Company's earnings per share increasing at or above a 15% annual compound 
growth rate and (b) a demanding absolute total shareholder return target against which options will vest on a sliding scale. 20% of the 
options will vest at a 15% annual compound total shareholder return (TSR) and the options will vest in full at or above a 25% annual 
compound TSR. Subject to the meeting of the performance criteria and to continuing employment, 600,000 options will vest in 
September 2014 and a further 200,000 in each of September 2015 and September 2016. No consideration was paid for the grant of the 
options. The Company will continue to operate within its 15% rolling dilution limit. The plan entails the use of a trust so that existing 
issued shares can be purchased by the trustee in the market to satisfy any exercise of options.
During 2014 the Remuneration Committee made changes to the EPS and TSR growth targets of the LTRP to better reflect the impact on 
profit growth of the Company's higher than anticipated increase in subscription revenue, triggered by the accelerating transition to 
recurring revenue, something that was not entirely anticipated when the LTRP was first put in place. Further details are set out in note 18 
of the Financial Statements on page 52.
