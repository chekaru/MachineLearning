THE REMUNERATION REPORT
The Committee
The members of the Committee are Mr Graham Frost (Chairman), Ms Lesley James, Mr Terry Stannard and Sir  Hugh Bidwell, all independent non-
executive Directors who have no personal interest in the matters to be decided, other than as shareholders and no day-to-day involvement in the
management of the Company. At the beginning of the financial year up until the Annual General Meeting on 30 May 2002, the members of the
Committee were Mr George Proctor (Chairman), Sir Hugh Bidwell and Mr Rodney Galpin and Sir Hugh continues to serve on the Committee until 31
March 2003. Mr Graham Frost was appointed Chairman of the Committee on 30 May 2002 and continues in this role until 31 March 2003. Ms Lesley
James will assume the role of Chairman thereafter.
Compliance with the Listing Rules
The Company aims to follow best practice in relation to its remuneration policy and, in particular complies with the relevant principles set out in the
Combined Code.
Remuneration Policy
The aim of the Committee is to establish a level of remuneration sufficient to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors and senior managers of
the highest calibre required to achieve the Group's objectives in the current and future years as well as establishing an overall framework for
remunerating all employees. The Committee has responsibility delegated to it to determine remuneration packages for the executive Directors of the
Company and also those senior executives reporting directly to the Chief Executive. Additionally it has an overview role in relation to UK group
remuneration policy generally and makes recommendations thereon to the Board for its approval.
Reviews of the Group's remuneration policy are carried out periodically with advice from independent consultants as required to ensure that the type
and level of emoluments and incentive schemes are competitive in the market place and are supportive of the Group's business objectives and the
creation of shareholder value. Benchmarking comparisons are made with the remuneration policies of companies whose turnover/activities are similar
to the Group's with advice received from George Greenham Associates and Deloitte & Touche who have been appointed by the Committee to provide
remuneration consultancy services and who are not engaged by the Company to provide any other services.
The Committee has developed a remuneration policy which provides a competitive base salary having regard to levels of responsibility, experience
and market comparatives; requires challenging performance targets to be met to qualify for annual performance bonus payments; links individuals to
the long term success of the Group through the annual award of share options with amounts determined in accordance with the seniority of the
individual.
The targeted composition of Directors' remuneration is as follows:
Non-performance Performance
related related
Executive Directors 65%-75% 25%-35%
Non-executive Directors 100% -
Remuneration Package
The Committee seeks to maintain an appropriate balance between performance and non-performance related elements of the remuneration packages
in respect of each executive Director. The components of the remuneration package comprise long term and short term goals in four elements: base
salary and benefits, an annual performance bonus, long term incentive arrangements and pension benefits as outlined below:
Base Salary
Base salary is designed to recognise the executive Director's or senior manager's ongoing market value. Reviews of base salary are conducted
annually by the Committee having regard to the individual's performance and the practice of similar companies.
Performance Bonus
The Company operates discretionary cash bonus schemes for executive Directors and for management. The level of bonus is dependent on Group
profit and individual performance. The Committee considers the profit and personal performance criteria to be appropriately challenging. Executive
Directors and senior management can earn a cash bonus of up to 25% of their salary, calculated on the basis of three factors, two of which are
financial performance criteria and the third personal objectives.
Details of Directors' remuneration are shown on page 19 (Table 1).
Long-Term Incentives
Executive Share Option Scheme
The Committee has a programme for the granting of discretionary share options to executive Directors and senior management on an annual basis to
incentivise long-term performance. No payment is required on such grant and no share options are granted at a discount. The exercise of executive
options is subject to a performance condition that the growth in the Group's earnings per share must exceed by at least 6% the growth in the retail
price index over any rolling three year period prior to exercise. The Committee believe that this criteria is appropriate for the Company because it
provides a direct link between rewards for executives and returns to shareholders and encourages senior executives to identify with the longer term
results of the Company reflected in the share price.
Employee Share Option Plan
The Company also has an Employee Share Option Scheme in which all employees including the executive Directors are eligible to participate. Under
the Employee Scheme, the Company makes annual share option awards to qualifying employees to recognise and reward length of service. The level
of award is determined by number of years in employment with the Company and there are no other eligibility or performance criteria.
The existing Executive and Employee Share Option Schemes were established at the time of the Company's flotation in 1994 and no further options
may be granted under them after 24 January 2004, the tenth anniversary of the date on which the Company's shares were first listed. So that the
Company may continue to reward and incentivise employees and executives in this way, shareholder approval is being sought for a new combined
share option plan for future years.
Details of Directors' interests in share options are shown on page 19 (Table 2) 18  ALPHA Airports Group Plc
Long-Term Incentive Plan
Following consultation with a number of the Company's larger institutional investors, a Long-Term Incentive Plan for the Chief Executive was approved
at the Annual General Meeting in 2002 with performance criteria which had been selected by the Committee as being appropriately challenging. An
award of 715,000 shares was accordingly made under the Plan on 30 May 2002 and the shares acquired on the open market during July in three
tranches when the Company's average share price was 69 pence. Details of this award made to Mr Kevin Abbott are shown on page 20 (Table 3).
Pension Benefits
All of the executive Directors participate in the ALPHA Airports Group Pension and Life Assurance Plan (the Plan). This is a contributory defined
benefit scheme. The executive Directors are eligible for membership of the executive section of the Plan which provides for retirement at the age of
60 with a maximum pension, after 20 years service, equivalent to two-thirds of the highest year's pensionable salary in the five years ending on
retirement. It also provides a lump sum death in service benefit of four times pensionable salary, a spouses' pension of four-ninths of pensionable
salary or two thirds of prospective pension.
Pensions are guaranteed to increase at the rate of 5% per annum or inflation if less (3% per annum or inflation if less for benefits earned before 6 April
1997). Following advice from the Plan's actuary the Company pays a contribution rate of 11.2% of capped pensionable salary (net of 6% members'
contribution from 1 August 2000).
In 1997, the Company established a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme (FURBS) to provide executive Directors affected by the
earnings cap ( 97,200 per annum for the 2002/03 tax year) with benefits equivalent to those which would be provided by the executive section of the
Plan if the earnings cap did not apply.
Details of Directors' pension benefits and the additional pension entitlements earned during the year ended 31 January 2003 which will accrue for
them under FURBS are shown on page 20 (Table 4).
Performance Graph
The line graph shown below illustrates the Company's total shareholder return for the past five years compared to the average total shareholder return
achieved by the companies making up the FTSE Small Cap index over the same period. The FTSE Small Cap index was selected by the Committee as
the most representative index appropriate for comparison, because it is a widely used and understood index of broadly similar size UK companies to
the Company.
Directors' Service Contracts
The Company's policy is that no executive Director has a service contract that has a fixed term of more than one year, or which contains a notice
entitlement exceeding one year. Generally normal termination payments under Directors' contracts are not intended to exceed 100% of annual basic
salary plus bonus, in line with the one year notice period recognising the Directors' general duty to mitigate. However, in the event of a take-over or
acquisition of the Company which results in the loss of office or status for the Chief Executive, a sum equal to 125% of annual salary plus any unpaid
but accrued bonus is payable.
Mr Kevin Abbott has a rolling one year service contract dated 4 June 1998 under which the Company must give 12 months' notice to terminate the
agreement and pay his salary and contractual benefits in respect of that period. Mr Robert Stephenson has a rolling one year service contract dated
1 June 2001 under which the Company must give him 12 months' notice to terminate the agreement and pay his salary and contractual benefits in
respect of that period. Ms Heather McRae has a rolling one year service contract dated 1 March 2003 under which the Company must give
12 months' notice to terminate the agreement and pay her salary and contractual benefits in respect of that period. Mr David King has a letter of
appointment dated 31 January 2003 under which the Company must give 12 months' notice to terminate the appointment and pay his salary and
contractual benefits in respect of that period. Neither Mr Stephenson, Ms McRae nor Mr King are entitled to receive pre-determined amounts of
compensation in the event of early termination of their appointments.
None of the independent non-executive Directors have service contracts nor do they have a fixed term of appointment. However, they are entitled to
receive notice in the event of termination under their letters of appointment. The Company's policy is that such notice periods should not exceed one
year. Mr Graham Frost is entitled to 12 months' notice and Sir Hugh Bidwell, Mr Terry Stannard and Ms Lesley James are each entitled to six months'
notice.
Mr Michel Ennesser, being a non-independent non-executive Director, has been appointed for an initial period of three years up until 20 September
2003, subject to a notice period of six months. The Board is responsible for setting non-executive Directors' fees.

Note:
1. Vesting of the award is conditional on earnings per share (EPS) and share price performance criteria being met and the payment of  1 by the executive. If adjusted EPS for
the year ending 31 January 2005 calculated on a basis consistent with current accounting policies is 11p or more, then 50% of the award will vest. If such adjusted EPS is
9p, 16.5% of the award will vest. At EPS levels of between 9p and 11p, the proportion of the award which will vest will be calculated on a straight line basis. If the
Company's share price averaged over the period 1 December 2004 to 31 January 2005 is 120p or more, 50% of the award will vest. If such average share price is 90p,
16.5% of the award will vest. At levels of between 90p and 120p, the proportion of the award which will vest will be calculated on a straight line basis.
