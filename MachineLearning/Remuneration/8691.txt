 In preparing this Report and establishing its policy, the Board has given
full consideration to, and follows the provisions of, the Combined Code
and the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. Following
publication of the revised Combined Code, the Committee continues
to review remuneration policy and principles and believes that it meets
the requirements of the new Code.
The Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee are Ms Lesley James
(Chairman), Mr Stannard and Mr Frost, two independent non-executive
directors and the Company's Chairman, who have no personal interest
in the matters to be decided, other than as shareholders and no day to
day involvement in the management of the Company. Sir Hugh Bidwell
served on the Committee until his retirement on 31 March 2003, and the
Committee was chaired by Mr Frost until that date. The Chief Executive
and the Group HR Director attend to advise the Committee when
required but do not participate in decisions relating to their own
remuneration.
Remuneration Policy 
The aim of the Committee is to establish a level of remuneration
sufficient to attract, retain and motivate executive directors and senior
managers of the highest calibre required to achieve the Group's
objectives in the current and future years as well as establishing an
overall framework for remunerating all employees. The Committee
has responsibility delegated to it to determine remuneration packages
for the executive directors of the Company and also those senior
executives reporting directly to the Chief Executive. Additionally it has
an overview role in relation to Group remuneration policy generally and
makes recommendations thereon to the Board for its approval.
Reviews of the Group's remuneration policy are carried out periodically
with advice from independent consultants as required to ensure that the
type and level of emoluments and incentive schemes are competitive in
the market place and are supportive of the Group's business objectives
and the creation of shareholder value. Benchmarking comparisons are
made with the remuneration policies of companies whose turnover
and/or activities are similar to the Group's. Advice is given by Deloitte
and Touche who have been appointed by the Committee to provide
remuneration consultancy services and who are not engaged by the
Company to provide any other services.
The Committee has developed a remuneration policy which includes
acompetitive base salary having regard to levels of responsibility,
experience and market comparatives. Performance-related elements
form a significant and growing part of the total remuneration package
and include bonus payments linked to challenging performance targets
and an annual award of share options to link the rewards of executives
to the long term success of the Group. To encourage long term
commitment, a change to the bonus plan is proposed to allow executive
directors to receive a proportion of bonus in the form of shares to be
held in trust until three years after the award date.
The composition of targeted remuneration for executive directors
will change following the introduction of the changes noted below
to bonuses and share options in the current year .
Remuneration Package
The Committee seeks to maintain an appropriate balance between
performance and non-performance related elements of the
remuneration packages in respect of each executive director and senior
manager . The components of the remuneration package comprise long
term and short term goals in four elements: base salary and benefits,
an annual performance bonus, long term incentive arrangements and
pension benefits as outlined below: 
Base Salary
Base salary is designed to recognise the executive director's or senior
manager's ongoing market value. Reviews of base salary are conducted
annually by the Committee having regard to the individual's performance,
any changes to the level of responsibility and the practice of similar
companies. The Company also provides private healthcare and a car . 
Performance Bonus
The Company operates bonus schemes for executive directors and
for management. The level of bonus is dependent on Group profit and
individual performance. The Committee considers the profit and
personal performance criteria to be appropriately challenging.
For the year ended 31 January 2004, executive directors and senior
management could earn a cash bonus set at a maximum amount of
25% of their salary, calculated on the basis of two equal factors. The
first factor was based on employee satisfaction results at unit,
divisional and group levels and the second was financial. The
percentage achieved on the first factor determined the percentage
paid on the second factor . For the year ending 31 January 2005, the
Committee has decided that the payment of bonus will be dependent
on Group profit for the year . Provided that challenging profit targets
are met, employee satisfaction results will then determine the level
of bonus paid out for 50% of the potential award.
In line with the policy of increasing the proportion of remuneration
linked to corporate and individual performance, the Committee has
reviewed information provided by Deloitte and Touche and decided
to increase the maximum level of incentive bonus payments for
executive directors to 50% of salary beginning with the bonus
calculation for year ending 31 January 2005. It is intended that if an
award of more than 10% of salary is made then half of the award above
10% would be in the form of shares rather than cash and the executive
would lose their entitlement to the shares if they left the Company
within three years of the award. Proposals to establish an appropriate
Bonus Plan for administration of this scheme will be considered by
shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and a
summary of the main terms of the proposed Plan are shown in the
Notice of Meeting on pages 49 to 51.
Details of directors' remuneration during the year are shown on
page 24 (Table 1).
Long-Term Incentives
Executive Share Option Scheme
The Committee has a programme for the granting of share options
to executive directors and senior management on an annual basis to
incentivise long-term performance. No payment is required on such

Executive directors 65%-75% 25%-35% 50%-60% 40%-50%
Non-executive directors 100% - 100% - grant and no share options are granted at a discount. Executive options
granted in previous financial years are subject to a performance
condition that the growth in the Group's earnings per share before
exceptional items must exceed by at least 6% the growth in the retail
price index over any rolling three year period prior to exercise.
Following the expiry of the original Scheme, a new Share Option Plan
was approved at the AGM in 2003 and appropriately challenging targets
have been set by the Remuneration Committee after discussion with
major shareholders. In respect of options granted to executive directors
and senior employees during 2004/05, the performance target is that
the growth in adjusted earnings per share (before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items) must exceed growth in the retail price index by a
total of at least 9% over the three year period ending 31 January 2007.
The Committee believe that this criteria is appropriate for the Company
because it provides a direct link between rewards for executives and
returns to shareholders and encourages senior executives to identify
with the longer term results of the Company reflected in the share price.
Performance targets are reviewed before each grant of options and the
most appropriate measure is selected at that time. If the condition is
met, the options will become exercisable in full from the third
anniversary of the grant date. If the condition is not met for the period
ending 31 January 2007, no re-testing will be allowed and the option will
lapse. In the event of the early exercise of options on a change of control
or cessation of employment, conditions will be time-apportioned unless
the Committee considers it appropriate to waive them in full or in part.
Executive directors were previously granted up to 120,000 options each
year and, in line with the Deloitte and Touche review, this has been
increased to a maximum amount of one year's salary per annum which
will be granted under the new Plan this year and in future years. Senior
management will continue to receive either 70,000 or 30,000 options
depending on their level of seniority.
Employee Share Option Scheme
The Company also has an employee share option scheme in which all
employees including the executive directors are eligible to participate.
The Company makes annual share option awards at market price to
qualifying employees to recognise and reward length of service. The
level of award is determined by number of years in employment with the
Company and there are no other eligibility or performance criteria.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
A Long-Term Incentive Plan for the Chief Executive was approved in
2002 following consultation with a number of the Company's larger
institutional investors. An award of 715,000 shares was accordingly
made under the Plan on 30 May 2002 and the shares acquired on the
open market during July 2002 in three tranches when the Company's
average share price was 69 pence. Details of the award made to
Mr Abbott are shown on page 25 (Table 3) along with the performance
criteria selected by the Committee as being appropriately challenging.
Pension Benefits
All of the executive directors participate in the Alpha Airports Group
Pension and Life Assurance Plan (the Plan ). This is a contributory
defined benefit scheme. The executive directors are eligible for
membership of the executive section of the Plan which provides for
retirement at the age of 60 with a maximum pension, after 20 years 
service, equivalent to two-thirds of the highest year's pensionable
salary in the five years ending on retirement. It also provides a lump
sum death in service benefit of four times pensionable salary, a
spouses' pension of four-ninths of pensionable salary or two thirds
of prospective pension. 
Pensions are guaranteed to increase at the rate of 5% per annum or
inflation if less (3% per annum or inflation if less for benefits earned
before 6 April 1997). Following advice from the Plan's actuary the
Company pays a contribution rate equivalent to 13.1% of capped
pensionable salary (additional to the members' contribution which is
8% from 1 August 2003).
In 1997, the Company established a Funded Unapproved Retirement
Benefit Scheme (FURBS ) to provide executive directors affected by the
earnings cap ( 99,000 per annum for the 2003/04 tax year) with benefits
equivalent to those which would be provided by the executive section of
the Plan if the earnings cap did not apply. 
Details of directors' pension benefits and the additional pension
entitlements earned during the year ended 31 January 2004 which will
accrue for them under FURBS are shown on page 26 (Table 4).
Performance Graph
The line graph shown below illustrates the Company's total
shareholder return for the past five years compared to the average total
shareholder return achieved by the companies making up the FTSE
Small Cap index over the same period. The FTSE Small Cap index was
selected by the Committee as the most representative index
appropriate for comparison, because it is a widely used and understood
index of broadly similar size UK companies to the Company.
Total Return Indices
Directors' Service Contracts
The Company's policy is that executive directors should have rolling
service contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum
of one year's notice. Normal termination payments under directors'
contracts are not intended to exceed 100% of annual basic salary plus
bonus, in line with the one year notice period.
Under Mr Abbott's contract dated 4 June 1998, Ms McRae's contract
dated 1 March 2003, Mr Stephenson's contract dated 1 June 2001 and
Mr King's letter of appointment dated 31 January 2003, the Company
must give 12 months  notice to terminate the agreement and pay salary
and contractual benefits in respect of that period. In the event of early
termination, the Company's policy is to act fairly in all circumstances
and to take the duty to mitigate into account. Neither Ms McRae nor
Mr King are entitled to receive pre-determined amounts of
compensation and the same terms applied to the executive director
Mr Stephenson who was made redundant from the Company
on 19 January 2004. The Committee are currently reviewing the
contractual arrangements for Mr Abbott, the Chief Executive whereby a
sum equal to 125% of annual salary plus any unpaid but accrued bonus
would be payable to him in the event of a take-over or acquisition of the
Company which resulted in his loss of office or status.

1Vesting of the award is conditional on earnings per share (EPS) and share price performance criteria being met and the payment of  1 by the
executive. If adjusted EPS (before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items) for the year ending 31 January 2005 calculated on a basis
consistent with current accounting policies is 11p or more, then 50% of the award will vest. If such adjusted EPS is 9p, 16.5% of the award will
vest. At adjusted EPS levels of between 9p and 11p, the proportion of the award which will vest will be calculated on a straight line basis. If the
Company's share price averaged over the period 1 December 2004 to 31 January 2005 is 120p or more, 50% of the award will vest. If such average
share price is 90p, 16.5% of the award will vest. At levels of between 90p and 120p, the proportion of the award which will vest will be calculated on
a straight line basis.

Notes
1 None of the directors contributed to FURBS during the year .
2 The FURBS provides benefits in lump sum form, but these have been notionally converted into pensions in the above table for ease of comparison.
3 The transfer values in the above table have been calculated in accordance with Retirement Benefit Schemes - Transfer Values (GN11)  as
published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
4 Figures for Mr King show the increase in pension over the year . The accrued pension shown includes service before 1 February 2003.
5 Figures are based on salaries as at 1 February 2003.
6 Mr Stephenson was made redundant on 19 January 2004 and elected to take early retirement in respect of his pension entitlement. As such the
figures shown above in respect of this member have been calculated as at 19 January 2004 and show the early retirement pension payable at that
date. The increase in pension is negative due to the reductions made on early retirement. The transfer value shown as at 31 January 2004 is the
value of the immediate early retirement pension. The large increase in transfer value reflects the different valuation methods for pensions in
payment as compared to the method for deferred pensions.
