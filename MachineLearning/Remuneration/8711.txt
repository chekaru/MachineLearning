 Remuneration Report
This Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee on
behalf of the Board in accordance with the requirements of the
Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and the Listing Rules
of the Financial Services Authority. Shareholders will be asked to
approve the Committee's Report at the 2005 Annual General Meeting.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Ms James, an independent
non-executive director . Mr Frost, the Company's Chairman, and 
Mr Stannard, an independent non-executive director are the other two
members. None of the members have any personal interest in the
matters to be decided, other than as shareholders, and no day to day
involvement in the management of the Company. The Chief Executive
and the Group HR Director are invited to attend most of the Committee's
meetings and give advice when required but they do not attend
discussions when decisions relating to their own remuneration are
being taken.
Remuneration Policy
The aim of the Committee is to establish a level of remuneration
sufficient to attract, retain and motivate executive directors and senior
managers of the highest calibre who have the experience and skills to
manage and develop the Group's businesses. The Committee has
responsibility delegated to it to determine remuneration packages for
the executive directors of the Company and also those senior executives
reporting directly to the executive directors. Additionally it aims to
establish an appropriate overall framework for the remuneration of
Group employees and has an overview role in relation to Group
remuneration policy generally.
Reviews of the Group's remuneration policy are carried out periodically
with advice from independent consultants as required to ensure that the
type and level of emoluments and incentive schemes are competitive in
the market place and are supportive of the Group's business objectives
and the creation of shareholder value. Benchmarking comparisons are
made with the remuneration packages of similar jobs in a comparative
group of companies whose turnover or activities are similar to the
Group's. Advice is available from Deloitte & Touche who have been
appointed by the Committee to provide remuneration consultancy
services and who are not engaged by the Company to provide any other
services. The Committee monitors developments in best practice and
consults with major shareholders when appropriate.
The Committee has developed a remuneration policy for executive
directors which includes a competitive base salary having regard to
levels of responsibility, experience and market comparatives.
Performance-related elements form a significant part of the total
remuneration package and include bonus payments linked to
challenging performance targets and an annual award of share options
to link the rewards of executives to the long term success of the Group.
The composition of total targeted remuneration is approximately 40%
performance related and 60% non-performance related for executive
directors and 100% non-performance related for non-executive
directors.
Remuneration Package
The Committee seeks to maintain an appropriate balance between
performance and non-performance related elements of the
remuneration packages in respect of each executive director and senior
manager . The components of the remuneration package comprise long
term and short term goals in four elements: base salary and benefits,
an annual performance bonus, share option incentive arrangements
and pension benefits as outlined below:
Base salary
Base salary is designed to recognise the executive director's or senior
manager's ongoing market value. Reviews of base salary are conducted
annually by the Committee having regard to the individual's
performance, any changes to the level of responsibility and the practice
of similar companies. The Company also provides benefits such as
private healthcare and a car or car allowance. 
Details of directors' remuneration during the year are shown on page 24
(Table 1).
Performance Bonus
The Company operates bonus schemes for executive directors and for
management. At the annual general meeting last year, approval was
given for the introduction of a new incentive bonus plan for executive
directors. This new plan increased the maximum level of bonus payable
to 50% of salary and stated that half the award of any amount payable
above 10% of salary would be paid in the form of shares to be held in
trust for three years. For the year ended 31 January 2005, the payment
of bonus was dependent on the Group achieving certain profit targets at
the full year with additional employee satisfaction criteria at unit level
determining the level of bonus paid. As the Group profit targets were not
met, no incentive bonus was payable for the year ended 31 January 2005
to any directors or employees. For the year ending 31 January 2006, the
payment of bonus will again be dependent on the Group achieving
specified levels of profit at the full year . Half of any profit above a
demanding target level will be available for bonus awards up to the
percentage of salary relevant to the individuals' participation levels of
50% (directors), 25% (senior management) or 12.5% (other participating
employees). Individuals will only be eligible to receive a bonus if their
own business unit achieves its profit targets. 
Long-Term Incentives
Executive Share Option Scheme
The Company grants share options to executive directors and senior
management on an annual basis to incentivise long-term performance.
No payment is required on such grant and no share options are granted
at a discount. Cash options are granted to overseas executives and
unapproved share options may be satisfied in cash to manage the
Company's share dilution limits. Exercise of options is subject to a
performance condition, in order to link the exercise of options with
sustained improvements in the financial performance of the Company.
Executive options granted before the annual general meeting in 2003
are subject to a performance condition that the growth in the Group's
earnings per share (before exceptional items) must have exceeded by at
least 6% the growth in the retail price index over any three year period
beginning no earlier than the financial year in which the options were
granted. Under the Share Option Plan approved at the annual general
meeting in 2003, the Remuneration Committee review and select
appropriately challenging targets each time there is a grant of options.
After consideration of other measures, the Committee selected growth
in adjusted earnings per share (before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items) as the most appropriate criteria for the Company as
it provides a direct link between rewards for executives and returns to
shareholders and encourages senior executives to identify with the
longer term results of the Company reflected in the share price. In
respect of options granted to executive directors and senior employees
during 2004/05, the performance target set after consultation with
major shareholders was that the growth in adjusted earnings per share
must exceed growth in the retail price index by a total of at least 9% over
the three year period ending 31 January 2007. After reviewing the
22
Alpha Airports Group Plc
Annual Report 2004/05
The Remuneration Report strategic plan for the following three years, the Committee decided
that in respect of options granted to executive directors and senior
managers during 2005/06, the performance target will be that the
growth in adjusted earnings per share (before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items) must exceed growth in the retail price index by a
total of at least 36% over the three year period ending 31 January 2008.
If the condition is met, the options will become exercisable in full from
the third anniversary of the grant date. If the condition is not met for the
three year period specified for options granted in 2004 and 2005, no re-
testing will be allowed and the option will lapse. In the event of the early
exercise of options on a change of control or cessation of employment,
conditions will be time-apportioned unless the Committee considers it
appropriate to waive them in full or in part. Since 2004, eligible
executive directors have been granted a maximum number of options
equivalent to the value of one year's salary per annum and this policy
will continue for future years. Senior management receive either 70,000
or 30,000 options depending on their level of seniority. The Chief
Executive, Mr Abbott, has not participated in the executive share option
scheme whilst his long term incentive plan has been in operation. He
became eligible to participate in share option grants made after the
announcement of preliminary results in 2005.
Employee Share Option Scheme
The Company also has an employee share option scheme in which all
employees including the executive directors are eligible to participate.
The Company makes annual share option awards at market price to
qualifying employees to recognise and reward length of service. The
level of award is determined by number of years in employment with the
Company and there are no other eligibility or performance criteria.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
A Long-Term Incentive Plan for the Chief Executive was approved in
2002 following consultation with a number of the Company's larger
institutional investors. An award of 715,000 shares was accordingly
made under the Plan on 30 May 2002 and the shares acquired on the
open market during July in three tranches when the Company's average
share price was 69 pence. Details of the award made to Mr Abbott are
shown on page 25 (Table 3) along with the challenging performance
conditions selected by the Committee as being the most appropriate
criteria at the time the award was made.
The earliest vesting date of the award was 1 February 2005 and the
quantity of shares due to Mr Abbott has been calculated in accordance
with the performance conditions. As the average share price for the
appropriate period was 90.1 pence, 16.6% of the total award has vested
and 118,773 shares have been transferred to Mr Abbott in accordance
with the share price performance criteria. As the earnings per share
target was not met, none of the award conditional on this criteria has
vested. A total of 16.6% of the total award has therefore vested and the
remainder will lapse.
There are no plans to make any further awards under the 2002 Long
Term Incentive Plan arrangements.
Pension Benefits
All of the executive directors participate in the Alpha Airports Group
Pension and Life Assurance Plan (the Plan ). This is a contributory
defined benefit scheme. The executive directors are eligible for
membership of the executive section of the Plan which provides for
retirement at the age of 60 with a maximum pension, after 20 years'
service, equivalent to two-thirds of the highest year's pensionable
salary in the five years ending on retirement. It also provides a lump
sum death in service benefit of four times pensionable salary, a
spouses' pension of four-ninths of pensionable salary or two thirds of
prospective pension.
Pensions are guaranteed to increase at the rate of 5% per annum or
inflation if less (3% per annum or inflation if less for benefits earned
before 6 April 1997). Following advice from the Plan's actuary the
Company pays a contribution rate equivalent to 13.1% of capped
pensionable salary (additional to the members' contribution which is
8% from 1 August 2003). 
In 1997, the Company established a Funded Unapproved Retirement
Benefit Scheme (FURBS ) to provide executive directors affected by the
earnings cap ( 102,000 per annum for the 2004/05 tax year) with
benefits equivalent to those which would be provided by the executive
section of the Plan if the earnings cap did not apply. The Committee is
considering the planned changes to pension legislation and will make
appropriate arrangements for the pension provision for executive
directors and other senior management after reviewing
recommendations from the Company's pension consultants and good
practice guidelines.
Details of directors' pension benefits and the additional pension
entitlements earned during the year ended 31 January 2005 which
accrued for them under FURBS are shown on page 26 (Table 4).
Performance Graph
The line graph shown below illustrates the Company's total
shareholder return for the past five years compared to the average total
shareholder return achieved by the companies making up the FTSE
Small Cap index over the same period. The Committee selected the
FTSE Small Cap index as the most appropriate comparator group for
this purpose as it is a widely used and understood index of broadly
similar size UK companies to the Company.

Directors' Service Contracts
The Company's policy is that executive directors should have rolling
service contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of
one year's notice. Normal termination payments under directors'
contracts are not intended to exceed 100% of annual basic salary plus
any bonus, in line with the one year notice period. 
Under Mr Abbott's contract dated 4 June 1998, Ms McRae's contract
dated 1 March 2003 and Mr King's letter of appointment dated
31 January 2003, the Company must give 12 months' notice to terminate
the agreement and pay salary and contractual benefits in respect of that
period. In the event of early termination, the Company's policy is to act
fairly in all circumstances and to take the duty to mitigate into account.
Neither Ms McRae nor Mr King are entitled to receive pre-determined
amounts of compensation. The Committee are currently reviewing the
contractual arrangements for Mr Abbott, the Chief Executive, whereby a
sum equal to 125% of annual salary plus any unpaid but accrued bonus
would be payable to him in the event of a take-over or acquisition of the
Company which resulted in his loss of office or status. The Committee is
reviewing a model contract suitable for introduction to all the executive
directors in due course. The model would comply with good practice for
executive service contracts.
External Appointments
The Board believes that a non-executive directorship of a company
outside the Alpha Group can provide executive directors with valuable
experience beneficial to the Company. During the year, Mr Abbott took
up a non-executive appointment with Electrocomponents plc and will
receive and retain fees of  36,000 per annum for this role.
Non-Executive Directors
None of the non-executive directors have service contracts. The
Chairman and independent non-executive directors were each
appointed for an initial three year term and renewal of their
appointments for a further three years has been approved. Michel
Ennesser is a non-independent non-executive director and was re-
appointed for a second term of three years from 21 September 2003,
subject to Servair continuing to hold at least 25% of the Company's
issued ordinary share capital. Each non-executive director is entitled
to receive notice in the event of termination under their letters of
appointment and the Company's policy is that such notice periods
should not exceed one year . Mr Frost is entitled to 12 months notice and
Mr Stannard, Ms James and Mr Ennesser are each entitled to 6 months
notice. The Board is responsible for setting non-executive directors'
fees and these are reviewed annually with regard to the director's
knowledge and experience, market norms and the duties and time
commitment required. The non-executive directors are not eligible to
participate in the share option plan or long term incentive plan, nor in
any Company pension arrangement.

Note:
1Vesting of the award was conditional on earnings per share (EPS) and share price performance criteria being met and the payment of  1 by the
executive. If adjusted EPS (before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items) for the year ending 31 January 2005 calculated on a basis
consistent with current accounting policies had been 11p or more, then 50% of the award would have vested. If such adjusted EPS had been 9p,
16.5% of the award would have vested. At adjusted EPS levels of between 9p and 11p, the proportion of the award vesting would have been
calculated on a straight line basis. If the Company's share price averaged over the period 1 December 2004 to 31 January 2005 had been 120p or
more, 50% of the award would have vested. If such average share price had been 90p, 16.5% of the award would have vested. At levels of between
90p and 120p, the proportion of the award vesting was calculated on a straight line basis. Since 1 February 2005, 16.6% of the award has vested
and 118,773 shares have been transferred to Mr Abbott. The remainder of the award will lapse.

Notes:
1 None of the Directors contributed to FURBS during the year .
2 The FURBS provides benefits in lump sum form, but these have been notionally converted into pensions in the above table for ease of comparison.
3 The transfer values in the above table have been calculated in accordance with Retirement Benefit Schemes - Transfer Values (GN11)  as
published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. This guidance led to an agreed change in the transfer value methodology. To ensure
consistency with the 31 January 2005 transfer value amounts, the 31 January 2004 transfer value figures have been re-worked based on this
updated method.
4 Inflationary increases over 2004/05 have been based on an inflation rate of 3.1%.
5 The accrued pension entitlements for Ms McRae have been recalculated as at 31 January 2004 and 31 January 2005 based on updated
information for pensionable earnings over the last four Plan Years. The updated 31 January 2004 accrued pension figure is slightly lower than that
given in last year's disclosures as the previous amounts were based on estimated average pensionable salary. Updated salary information for
Mr King has also been used but has had no effect on the deferred pensions in the table because his benefits from the Plan that accrued before he
joined the Executive Section are subject to the earnings cap.
