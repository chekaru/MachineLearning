 report of the remuneration committee
The Remuneration Committee, chaired by Mr M R Hornstein and comprising the Non-Executive Directors, is responsible for
determining the remuneration and incentive packages for the Executive Directors and for making recommendations to the Board
regarding the framework for senior management's packages. The employment terms for Executive Directors and senior management
are designed to attract and retain individuals of the right calibre to ensure the Group meets its objectives and incentives are structured
so as to align their interests with those of shareholders by rewarding them for enhancing shareholder value.
In setting the policy, full consideration has been given to Section B of the best practice provisions annexed to the London Stock
Exchange Listing Rules.
EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION 
The main components of the remuneration of the Executive Directors are basic annual salary, bonus payments, share option incentives,
pension contributions and benefits in kind including a company car (or car allowance), private medical cover and death in service benefits.
Basic salary: Salaries are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee with effect from 1 December in each year in order to
ensure that basic salary is appropriate for the responsibilities involved.The Committee reviewed salary levels at comparable companies
and commissioned a survey from independent advisers to ensure the levels are appropriate.
Performance related bonuses: Bonuses are earned by achieving financial targets set by the Remuneration Committee based on earnings
per share. The payments are restricted to an appropriate percentage of salary and are not pensionable. The maximum bonus that can
be earned is equivalent to 87.5% of basic salary for each of the Executive Directors.
Share options: The Company currently has two share option schemes. Options are exercisable between 3 and 10 years from the date
of the grant of the option, subject to the performance conditions set out below:
1997 Executive Share Option Scheme:
  average growth in earnings per share (as defined) must exceed growth in RPI by at least 4 %
  share price to have increased by 35%

to the executive contributing 5% of basic salary.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
All the Executive Directors have service contracts that can be terminated by either the Company or the Director by giving 12 months
notice. It is the Company's policy to ensure that any payments made to Directors in the event of early termination of a service contract
take into full account the reasons for the termination.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Non-Executive Directors each receive a fee for their services which is agreed by the Board. The fees of the Non-Executives,
excluding the Chairman, are based on the recommendation of the Chairman with the assistance of independent advice concerning
comparable organisations and appointments. The Chairman's fees are recommended by the Senior Non-Executive following
independent advice.
Contracts are for a maximum of three years.The Chairman's contract runs to 31 March 2004, Dr M Chamberlain's contract to 31 March
