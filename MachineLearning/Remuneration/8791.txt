 REPORT ON REMUNERATION
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for Executive Directors and senior
management and to determine specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors and following
independent advice recommending the Chairman's fees to the Board. The Remuneration Committee is formally
constituted with written Terms of Reference, which were modified during the year to reflect current best practice.
During the year Dr M A Chamberlain, the Senior Non-Executive Director, was appointed Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee in succession to Mr M R Hornstein, who remains a member of the Committee. Mr A J McWalter was appointed
a member of the Committee on 15 January 2003. The Committee meets at least twice a year. 
The Group Chief Executive normally attends meetings but does not take part in discussions in relation to his own
remuneration and benefits. 
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION POLICY REVIEW AND COMPLIANCE
The Committee has recently appointed Halliwell Consulting to undertake a full review of Executive Director and senior
executive remuneration. No other services have been provided to the Company by Halliwell Consulting. It is the aim of
the Remuneration Committee to encourage and reward high performance and to attract and retain individuals of the
right calibre to ensure the Group meets its objectives and incentives are structured so as to align their interests with those
of shareholders by rewarding them for enhancing shareholder value. It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that
shareholders' interests are best served by focusing a greater proportion of total remuneration on performance related
compensation. As such it is intended that the company put in place a new executive share incentive arrangement. 
The details of the proposal for the new executive share incentive plan and how it will sit within the overall remuneration
policy are included in the shareholder circular being sent with this annual report. This and a proposal for a new all
employee share scheme are to be submitted for approval at the Company's annual general meeting. 
The charts below show the relationship between the performance elements and the fixed elements of the 2003
remuneration package for each of the Executive Directors. To ensure that a complete picture is given, share options
granted in the year have been valued using the Black-Scholes methodology and have been included in the performance
element of the annual compensation package.
Black-Scholes provides a theoretical cash value for options today but it should be noted that the real value received by
Executive Directors under the share incentive arrangements will be dependent upon the degree to which the associated
performance conditions have been satisfied at the end of the three year performance period and whether the share
price of the Company has increased from the date of grant. 
The Company has complied with the recommendations of the Combined Code on Director's remuneration as
implemented by the Financial Services Authority in its Listing Rules for listed companies and the Directors' Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002.
BASE SALARY 
The Remuneration Committee's policy is to set the base salaries of the Executive Directors' at around the median of a group
of comparable companies. Salaries are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee with effect from 1 December.
