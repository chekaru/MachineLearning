 The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for Executive Directors and senior
management and for determining specific remuneration packages for the Executive Directors. The Committee comprises
Dr Michael Chamberlain (Chairman) and Alan McWalter. Rodney Hornstein resigned from the Committee on 24 March
2004. The Chairman and Group Chief Executive also attend Remuneration Committee meetings by invitation. The
Remuneration Committee received wholly independent advice on Executive compensation and incentives from Halliwell
Consulting during the year. No other services were provided to the Company by Halliwell Consulting during the year.
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written Terms of Reference with the full remit of the Committee
role described. A copy of the Terms of Reference is available on request from the Company Secretary. The Remuneration
Committee met three times during the year, with each meeting fully attended. The Board has reviewed the Group's
compliance with the Combined Code ( the Code') on remuneration-related matters. It is the opinion of the Board that the
Group complied with all remuneration-related aspects of the Code during the year, except under provision B.2.1, that
Rodney Hornstein is not considered independent by the Code and hence the Committee comprised a non-independent
member until his resignation on 24 March 2004.
REMUNERATION POLICY 
The Remuneration Committee's policy is to set the main elements of the remuneration package at the following quartiles
in comparison to the Company's comparator group:-
Base salary Annual bonus potential Pension Benefits in Kind Share incentives
Median Median to upper quartile Market practice Market practice Median
It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that shareholders' interests are best served by focusing a greater proportion
of total remuneration on performance-related compensation. As such, a new share incentive arrangement, the Alphameric plc
Long-Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP') was approved at the Company's 2004 AGM. The balance between fixed and variable
performance-based pay for each of the Executive Directors for the year ended 30 November 2004 was that 37% of the total
potential remuneration would come from  fixed' compensation (salary, benefits and pension) with the balance of 63%
coming from annual bonuses and the face value of the LTIP at grant.

ELEMENTS OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
Basic Salary
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the Executive Directors' salaries in December 2003. Salary increases of 5% were
made for each of the Executive Directors, with the exception of James Soulsby who received an 11% increase based on the
Committee's view of his outstanding performance and responsibilities.
Annual Performance-Related Bonus
The maximum bonus potential available for the Executive Directors for 2004 was 100% of salary. This was increased from
87.5% in 2003 after consultation with shareholders prior to the 2004 AGM. 
The Company's bonus plan was based on a group EPS target which, in itself, was based on the aggregate profit performance
of the Company's Divisions. During the year, the Company sold the Retail Division which represented approximately 58% of
the aggregate profit target. To reflect the disposal, the Remuneration Committee felt that it was inappropriate to include
the performance of the Retail Division in the calculation of bonus. Therefore, the Remuneration Committee reduced the
maximum effective bonus potential for 2004 to 42% of salary. The Company hit the group EPS target, adjusted to reflect the
sale of the Retail Division and, as such, bonuses equivalent to 42% of salary were paid to the Executive Directors.
The maximum bonus potential available for the Executive Directors for 2005 is 100% of salary. The targets for the 2005
financial year are based on the same performance measures as that for last year, namely earnings per share and budget
targets. Bonus payments are not pensionable.
Directors' Remuneration Report
Alphameric plc for the year ended 30 November 2004
18 Share Incentives
Up until the 2004 AGM, the Company made option awards to Executive Directors under the 1999 Senior Executive Share
Option Scheme. No further grants of options will be made under the Scheme; they are now eligible to participate in the
new Long-Term Incentive Plan approved at the 2004 AGM.
Grants during the Year
Alphameric plc Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  LTIP')
Executive Directors and senior executives are eligible to participate in the LTIP. Under the rules, the maximum annual award
that can be made to an individual is 100% of salary. As discussed with shareholders prior to the approval of the LTIP at the
2004 AGM, it is the current intention of the Remuneration Committee to retain these levels of award for 2005 and 2006.
Eligible executives are awarded rights to acquire a maximum number of shares at the beginning of a three-year period, a
proportion of which they will be entitled to acquire at the end of that period, depending on the extent to which (if at all)
the challenging performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time the allocation is made are
satisfied. The LTIP awards have been granted as nil cost options which are exercisable, subject to the satisfaction of
performance conditions, between 3 and 10 years from the date of grant. 
During the year, all the Executive Directors received LTIP awards equivalent to 100% of salary. The performance conditions
for this grant of awards are set out in the following table:-
TSR Position Against Comparator Group Long-Term Incentive Plan % of Shares Released
Below median 0%
Median 30%*
Upper quartile 100%*
*There is straight line vesting between points
In addition to the above comparative TSR performance of the Company, the EPS growth over the three-year holding period
must be at least RPI + 3% p.a. before any awards become exercisable. The Remuneration Committee will in any event satisfy
itself that the recorded TSR is a genuine reflection of the underlying financial performance of the Company before the
release of any share awards under the LTIP in accordance with the ABI guidelines.
Details of LTIP awards to Executive Directors are set out on page 21.
Existing Grants 
1999 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme
Options granted under this scheme are exercisable between 3 and 10 years from the date of grant, subject to the
satisfaction of the following performance conditions over the three-year performance period:
  average growth in earnings per share must exceed growth in RPI by at least 4% p.a. and
  for 50% of the shares under option, no additional share price target
  for 35% of the shares under option, the share price must have increased by 200% from the date of grant
  for 15% of the shares under option, the share price must have increased by 300% from the date of grant
Details of grants to Executive Directors are set out on page 21.
Dilution
In accordance with the ABI guidelines, the Company can issue a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling ten-
year period to employees under all its share plans. In addition, the current operation of the Company's share plans is within
ABI limits on a rolling basis for discretionary share plans.
Shareholding Requirement
As part of the introduction of the Company's new share incentive policy, Executive Directors who have been selected to
participate in the LTIP will be required to retain a proportion of the share awards released (or options exercised) each year
to build up the shareholding requirement over a five-year period. The shareholding requirement is 150% of salary for the
Group Chief Executive and 100% of salary for the other Executive Directors.
Pension
The Company pays the equivalent of 10% of the Executive Director's basic salary into a personal pension plan, subject to
the Executive contributing 5% of basic salary.
Benefits in Kind
Benefits in kind comprise a company car (or car allowance), private medical cover, permanent health insurance and death-
in-service benefits.

Executive Directors' Contracts
Each of the Executive Directors of the Company has a 12 month rolling contract, dated 17 February 2003. There are no

obligations and Executive Directors will be expected to mitigate their loss. In addition, the Remuneration Committee
ensures that there have been no unjustified payments for failure.

The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board based upon recommendations from the
Chairman and Chief Executive (or, in the case of the Chairman, based on recommendations from the Chairman of the

of the FTSE All Share Software & Computer Services Sector index over the last five years.
