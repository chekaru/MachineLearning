 Directors' Remuneration Report
Alphameric plc for the year ended 30 November 2005
16
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for Executive Directors and senior
management and for determining specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors. The Committee
comprises Dr Michael Chamberlain (Chairman) and Alan McWalter.  The Chairman of the Board and Group Chief Executive
also attend Remuneration Committee meetings by invitation but are excluded from discussions in relation to their own
remuneration. The Remuneration Committee received wholly independent advice on executive compensation and
incentives from Halliwell Consulting during the year.  No other services were provided to the Company by Halliwell
Consulting during the year.
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference with the full remit of the Committee
role described. A copy of the terms of reference is available on request from the Company Secretary. The Remuneration
Committee met three times during the year, with each meeting fully attended. The Board has reviewed the Group's
compliance with the Combined Code (the Code ) on remuneration related matters.  It is the opinion of the Board that the
group complied with all remuneration-related aspects of the Code during the year.
REMUNERATION POLICY 
The Remuneration Committee's policy is designed to attract and retain individuals of the right calibre, to encourage and
reward high performance and is to set the main elements of the remuneration package at the following quartiles in
comparison to the Company's comparator Group:-
Base salary Annual bonus potential Pension Benefits in Kind Share incentives
Median Median to upper quartile Market practice Market practice Median
It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that shareholders' interests are best served by focusing a greater proportion
of total remuneration on performance related compensation.  The balance between fixed and variable performance based pay
for each of the Executive Directors for the year ended 30 November 2005 was that 37% of the total potential remuneration
would come from  fixed' compensation (salary, benefits and pension) with the balance of 63% coming from annual bonuses
and the face value of the LTIP at grant.
COMPARATOR GROUP
The Company's comparator group for 2005 for the purposes of benchmarking remuneration and comparative performance
currently comprises the following companies drawn from the FTSE All Share Software and Computer Services and
Information Technology Hardware Indices. 
Anite Group Plc Innovation Group Plc Radstone Technology Plc
Aveva Group Plc Intec Telecom Systems Plc Retail Decisions Plc
Axon Group Plc iSOFT Group Plc RM Plc
Detica Group Plc Macro4 Plc Royalblue Group Plc
Dicom Group Plc Marlborough Stirling Plc SDL Plc
Eidos Plc Northgate Information Solutions Plc Surfcontrol Plc
Filtronic Plc NSB Retail Systems Plc TTP Communications Plc
Gresham Computing Plc Plasmon Plc Vega Group Plc
Imagination Technologies Group Plc Psion Plc Zetex (Telemetrix) Plc
The basis of selection of the comparator group was:- 
  companies in the same market sector as the Company; and 
  companies with comparable turnovers to the Company (with some reference to market capitalisation).
Due to corporate activity within the comparator group, Macro 4 Plc, Retail Decisions Plc, SDL Plc and Vega Group replaced
London Bridge Software Holdings Plc, Merant Plc, Staffware Plc and Synstar Plc.  These companies were selected based on the
criteria set out above and the Remuneration Committee do not believe that they will materially affect the nature of the Group
as a whole.
ELEMENTS OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
Basic Salary
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the Executive Directors' salaries in January 2005.  Salary increases of 3% were
made for each of the Executive Directors. 
Annual Performance Related Bonus
The maximum bonus potential available for the Executive Directors for 2005 was 100% of salary.    Directors' Remuneration Report
17
Alphameric plc for the year ended 30 November 2005
The Company's bonus plan was based on a group EPS target, which in itself was based on the aggregate profit performance
of the Group's Divisions. A performance of 96.9% was achieved by exceeding the EPS target and, as such, bonuses
equivalent to 96.9% of salary were paid to the Executive Directors.
The maximum bonus potential available for the Executive Directors for 2006 is 100% of salary.  The targets for the 2006
financial year are based on the same performance measures as that for last year namely earnings per share. Bonus
payments are not pensionable.
Share Incentives
Up until the 2004 AGM the Company made option awards to Executive Directors under the 1999 Senior Executive Share
Option Scheme.  No further grants of options will be made under the Scheme; Executive Directors are now eligible to
participate in the new Long-Term Incentive Plan approved at the 2004 AGM.
Alphameric plc Long-Term Incentive Plan (the LTIP )
Executive directors and senior executives are eligible to participate in the LTIP.  Under the rules, the maximum annual award
that can be made to an individual is 100% of salary.  As discussed with shareholders prior to the approval of the LTIP at the
2004 AGM, it is the current intention of the Remuneration Committee to retain this level of award for 2006. The overall
share incentive policy for Executive Directors will be reviewed fully in respect of awards for 2007.
Eligible executives are awarded rights to acquire a maximum number of shares at the beginning of a three year period, a
proportion of which they will be entitled to acquire at the end of that period depending on the extent to which (if at all)
the challenging performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time the allocation is made are
satisfied. The LTIP awards have been granted as nil cost options which are exercisable, subject to the satisfaction of
performance conditions, between 3 and 10 years from the date of grant. 
During the year all the Executive Directors received LTIP awards equivalent to 100% of salary. The performance conditions
for this grant of awards are set out in the following table:-
TSR Position Against Comparator Group Long-Term Incentive Plan % of Shares Released
Below median 0%
Median 30%*
Upper quartile 100%*
*There is straight line vesting between points
In addition to the above comparative TSR performance of the Company the EPS growth over the three year holding period
must be at least RPI + 3% p.a. before any awards become exercisable.  The Remuneration Committee will in any event satisfy
itself that the recorded TSR is a genuine reflection of the underlying financial performance of the Company before the
release of any share awards under the LTIP in accordance with the ABI guidelines.
Comparative TSR was selected as the performance condition for LTIP awards by the Remuneration Committee as it ensures
that the executives have outperformed their peers in the comparator group over the measurement period in delivering
shareholder value before being entitled to receive any of their awards irrespective of general market conditions.  In
addition the EPS underpin will ensure that the underlying financial performance of the Company is consistent with the TSR
performance over the measurement period.
Details of all LTIP awards to Executive Directors are set out on page 20.
Existing Grants 
1999 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme
Options granted under this scheme are exercisable between 3 and 10 years from the date of grant of the option, subject
to the satisfaction of the following performance conditions over the three year performance period:
  average growth in earnings per share must exceed growth in RPI by at least 4% p.a. and
  for 50% of the shares under option, no additional share price target
  for 35% of the shares under option, the share price must have increased by 200% from the date of grant
  for 15% of the shares under option, the share price must have increased by 300% from the date of grant
Details of grants to Executive Directors are set out on page 20.  No options granted to Executive Directors were exercised
or lapsed during the year. Performance Measurement
The Remuneration Committee determines whether the performance conditions for share awards or options are satisfied.
Where the performance requirements are based on EPS the Committee will use the principles behind the audited figures
disclosed in the Company's financial statements, and may take advice from independent advisors as to whether any
adjustments are required to ensure consistency in accordance with the terms of the performance conditions.  Where the
performance measure is TSR, Halliwell Consulting, the Remuneration Committee's advisors shall calculate the TSR and sign-
off these figures prior to the release of any award.  Performance conditions under the LTIP and Option Schemes are not
subject to re-testing.
Dilution
In accordance with the ABI guidelines the Company can issue a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling ten
year period to employees under all its share plans. The current operation of the Company's share plans is within ABI limits.
Shareholding Requirement
As part of the introduction of the Company's new share incentive policy, Executive Directors who have been selected to
participate in the LTIP will be required to retain a proportion of the share awards released (or options exercised) each year
to build up the shareholding requirement over a 5 year period.  The shareholding requirement is 150% of salary for the
Group CEO and 100% of salary for the other Executive Directors.
Pension
The Company pays the equivalent of 10% of the Executive Director's basic salary into a personal pension plan, subject to
the Executive contributing 5% of basic salary.
Benefits in Kind
Benefits in kind comprise a company car (or car allowance), private medical cover, permanent health insurance and death-
in-service benefits.
OTHER REMUNERATION MATTERS
Executive Directors' Contracts
Each of the Executive Directors of the Company has a 12 month rolling contract, dated 17 February 2003. There are no
special provisions in the service contracts relating to cessation of employment on change of control, other than, in the
event that they leave the Company within 6 months of change of control, either as a result of termination by the Company
or at the election of the executives, the executives will be entitled to be paid 12 months salary and benefits in
compensation for the 12 months notice period and, in lieu of future bonus which they may have been entitled to during
the 12 month notice period, the executives will be entitled to 12 months salary. The policy on termination is that the
Company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations and Executive Directors will be expected to mitigate
their loss.  In addition, the Remuneration Committee ensures that there have been no unjustified payments for failure.
The Alphameric plc Share Incentive Plan (SIP ) 
Shareholders approved the SIP at the 2004 AGM.  
The Board of the Company were keen to give all employees the opportunity to:-
  invest their salary in Company shares; and
  build up a shareholding in the Company.
The Company is currently offering eligible employees, including Executive Directors and senior executives, the opportunity
of purchasing (on a monthly basis)  1,500 of shares a year out of pre-tax salary and providing additional matching shares
on a 1 matching share to every 5 purchased ratio. These matching shares will be normally released three years after they
have been awarded provided that the associated shares purchased by the employee have been retained and provided the
employee is still employed by a Group Company at this time.
Details of shares purchased by and awarded to Executive Directors through the SIP are set out on page 21. 
Non-Executive Directors Policy:  Lower Quartile Level Fees
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board based upon recommendations from the
Chairman and Chief Executive (or, in the case of the Chairman, based on recommendations from the Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee following independent advice) and is within the limits set by the Articles of Association.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any bonus plan or share incentive programme operated by the Company and
are not entitled to pension contributions or other benefits provided by the Company.
