 INTRODUCTION 
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 and the Directors' Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002, (the Regulations ). The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles and complied with the provisions of the
revised Combined Code (the Code ) on Corporate Governance relating to directors' remuneration. As required by the
Regulations, an advisory resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the annual general meeting of the Company
at which the financial statements will be received and adopted. 
The auditors are required to report on the  auditable' part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of
the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations). The
report is therefore divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information. 
Part 2 of the Regulations - Unaudited Information 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
The Committee is comprised entirely of independent Non-Executive Directors, Michael Chamberlain (chairman) and Alan
McWalter. The responsibility for the establishment of a remuneration policy and its cost is a matter for the full Board, on
the advice of the Remuneration Committee. The recommendations of the Remuneration Committee have been approved
without amendment by the Board for submission to shareholders. 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for Executive Directors and senior
management and for determining specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors. The Remuneration
Committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential
conflicts of interests arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
During the period under review, the Remuneration Committee sought the assistance of the Chairman and Group Chief
Executive on matters relating to Directors' performance and remuneration. The Chairman and Chief Executive attend
meetings by invitation but do not attend when their individual remuneration arrangements are discussed. No Director
takes part in discussions relating to their own remuneration and benefits.  The Remuneration Committee appointed and
received wholly independent advice on executive compensation and associated share scheme administration from
Halliwell Consulting. No other services were provided to the Company by Halliwell Consulting during the year.  
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference with the full remit of the committee
role described. A copy of the terms of reference is available to shareholders on request from the Company Secretary.
REMUNERATION POLICY 
The policy is designed to attract and retain individuals of the right calibre, to encourage and reward high performance and
is to set the main elements of the remuneration package at the following quartiles in comparison to the Company's
comparator group:-
Base salary Annual bonus potential Pension Benefits in Kind Share incentives
Median Median to upper quartile Market practice Market practice Median
The Remuneration Committee believes that shareholders' interests are best served by remuneration packages which have a large
emphasis on performance related pay.  Emphasis on performance should encourage executives to focus on delivering the business
strategy and by providing meaningful incentives to executives ensure that the appropriate balance between fixed and performance
related pay is maintained. The balance between fixed and variable performance based pay for each of the Executive Directors for
the year ended 30 November 2006 was 37% of the total potential remuneration coming from fixed compensation (salary, benefits
and pension) with the balance of 63% coming from annual bonuses and the face value of the LTIP at grant.
REMUNERATION POLICY 2006 & 2007
The Remuneration Committee reviews on an annual basis whether the policy remains appropriate for the relevant financial
year. Factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee include:-
  market conditions affecting the Company;
  the recruitment market in the Company's sector;
  changing market practice;
  changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies. 
In line with this general review the Committee specifically considered how the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan would be
operated during 2007. The results were:-
  a decision to continue the current grant policy in 2007;
  that the Committee after reviewing the performance criteria and release schedules which applied to 2006 grants
determined that they remain appropriate to the Company's current circumstances and prospects and therefore will
apply to the 2007 grants to Executives.
In all other respects the policy applied during 2006 will continue to apply for 2007.

Alphameric plc for the year ended 30 November 2006 COMPARATOR GROUP
2006
The constituents of the Company's Comparator Group for benchmarking remuneration during 2006 were:-
Anite Group Plc Innovation Group Plc Radstone Technology Plc
Aveva Group Plc Intec Telecom Systems Plc Retail Decisions Plc
Axon Group Plc iSOFT Group Plc RM Plc
Detica Group Plc Macro4 Plc Royalblue Group Plc
Dicom Group Plc Marlborough Stirling Plc SDL Plc
Eidos Plc Northgate Information Solutions Plc Surfcontrol Plc
Filtronic Plc NSB Retail Systems Plc TTP Communications Plc
Gresham Computing Plc Plasmon Plc Vega Group Plc
Imagination Technologies Group Plc Psion Plc Zetex (Telemetrix) Plc
The basis of selection of the comparator group was:-
  companies in the same market sector as the Company; and
  companies with comparable turnovers to the Company (with some reference to market capitilisation).
2007
The Remuneration Committee is currently reviewing the constituents of the comparator group for 2007 due to corporate
activity during 2006 which saw five of the companies taken-over during the year.
ELEMENTS OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
Basic Salary
Policy 2006 & 2007: - Median
The following table sets out the salaries paid to the Executive Directors during 2006:- 
N Na am me e S Sa al la ar ry y  P Pa ai id d
A W Morcombe  225,000
M G Mclaren  179,000
M K Randall  132,000
J A Soulsby  174,000
Salaries for 2007 have not been determined at the date of this report due to the Company's review date in April 2007. The
Remuneration Committee's policy, however, will remain the same for 2007.
When determining the salary of the Executives the Committee takes into consideration:-
  the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills, in organisations of
broadly similar size and complexity, in particular the median salary levels of the companies in the comparator group;
  the performance of the individual Executive Director; 
  the individual Executive Director's experience and responsibilities; and
  pay and conditions throughout the Company.
Annual Performance Related Bonus
Policy 2006 & 2007: - Median to Upper Quartile Bonus Potential
The maximum bonus potential available for the Executive Directors for 2006 was 100% of salary.
The Company's bonus plan was based on a Group EPS target, which in itself was based on the aggregate profit performance
of the Group's divisions. The performance targets were not met for the year and therefore a bonus is not payable to the
Executive Directors for 2006.
The maximum bonus potential available for the Executive Directors for 2007 is 100% of salary. The targets for the 2007
financial year are based on the same performance measures as that for last year, namely earnings per share. Bonus
payments are not pensionable.
Share Incentives: - Policy 2006 & 2007 Median
The Remuneration Committee's policy is to provide annual share grants to Executives at the median level compared to the
comparator group. Share incentives, excluding all employee plans, are provided to the Executives solely through The
Alphameric plc Long-Term Incentive Plan (the LTIP). The Remuneration Committee believes that share awards under the LTIP
enable the Company to provide a competitive incentive and retention tool which is also cost effective in respect of both
shareholder dilution and P&L cost. Further, the grant of awards with the attached performance condition ensures that the
Company's comparative Total Shareholder Return (TSR
1
 ) performance against the comparator group is at least at the upper
quartile before Executives will receive the full benefit of their share incentives. This structure demonstrates the Remuneration
Committee's desire to correlate incentive arrangements with the achievement of substantial performance.
1
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) - is a measure showing the return on investing in one share of the Company over the performance period (the return is the value of the
capital gain and reinvested dividends).  It is normally used comparatively and the company which achieves the best return is ranked number one.
Directors' Remuneration Report
Alphameric plc for the year ended 30 November 2006
14 Directors' Remuneration Report
15
Alphameric plc for the year ended 30 November 2006
During the year all the Executive Directors received LTIP awards equivalent to 100% of salary, details of awards are on page
18. The performance conditions for grants are that the Company's EPS growth over the three year performance period must
be equal to or greater than RPI+3%p.a. before any of the award is capable of release. On the satisfaction of this condition
the release of the award is dependent on the Company's total shareholder return performance against the comparator
group. 30% of the award will be released for median comparative performance with 100% being released for upper quartile
performance. The proposed level of grants for 2007 will also be 100% of salary.
It should be noted that the real value received by the Executive Directors under the share incentive arrangements will be
dependent upon the degree to which the associated performance conditions have been satisfied at the end of the three
year performance period and the share price of the Company at this time.

Comparative TSR was selected as the performance condition for LTIP awards by the Remuneration Committee as it ensures that the
Executives have outperformed their peers in the comparator group over the measurement period in delivering shareholder value
before being entitled to receive any of their awards irrespective of general market conditions. In addition the EPS underpin will
ensure that the underlying financial performance of the Company is consistent with the TSR performance over the measurement
period. The Remuneration Committee will provide a full explanation and justification at the time of the release of award on why it
believes that the underlying financial performance of the Company is consistent with this TSR performance.
The Remuneration Committee determines whether the performance conditions for share awards are satisfied. Where the
performance requirements are based on EPS the Committee will use the principles behind the audited figures disclosed in
the Company's financial statements, and may take advice from independent advisors as to whether any adjustments are
required to ensure consistency in accordance with the terms of the performance conditions.  Where the performance
measure is Total Shareholder Return, Halliwell Consulting, the Remuneration Committee's advisors calculate the TSR in
accordance with the rules of the LTIP and sign-off these figures prior to the release of any award.

No other further grants of options will be made to the Executive Directors under the scheme. Existing options granted
under this scheme are exercisable between 3 and 10 years from the date of grant of the option, subject to the satisfaction
of the following performance conditions over the three year performance period:
  average growth in earnings per share must exceed growth in RPI by at least 4% p.a. and
  for 50% of the shares under option, no additional share price target
  for 35% of the shares under option, the share price must have increased by 200% from the date of grant
  for 15% of the shares under option, the share price must have increased by 300% from the date of grant
Details of existing grants to Executive Directors are set out on page17.  No options granted to Executive Directors were
exercised or lapsed during the year.

Each of the Executive Directors entered into service contracts on 17 February 2003. The contracts will continue unless
terminated by at least 12 months written notice. This arrangement is in line with best corporate practice for listed
companies. In the event of the termination of an Executive's contract, salary and benefits will be payable during the
notice period (there will, however, be no automatic entitlement to bonus payments or share incentive grants during the
period of notice other than where normal good leaver provisions apply). All Executive Directors will be expected to
mitigate their loss in accordance with general legal principles in the event of their cessation of employment. The
Remuneration Committee will ensure that there have been no unjustified payments for failure on an Executive Director's
termination of employment. There are currently special provisions in the contracts of employment relating to cessation
of employment on change of control whereby in the event that they leave the Company within 6 months of a change of
control, either as a result of termination by the Company or at the election of the Executives, the Executives will be
entitled to be paid a payment equivalent to 12 months salary in lieu of a future bonus which they may have been entitled
to during the 12 month notice period. The additional 12 months' salary payment will decrease on a monthly basis over
the 2007 calendar year so that by the end of this year a standard 12 months' notice will apply in all circumstances. There
are no circumstances, other than a change of control, where there are special provisions, for example liquidation of the
Company or cessation of employment.
