Directors' Remuneration Report
INTRODUCTION
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the Regulations ). The report also meets the relevant requirements of the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles and complied
with the provisions of the Combined Code 2008 (the Code ) on Corporate Governance relating to directors'
remuneration. As required by the Regulations, an advisory resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the
annual general meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be received and adopted. 
The auditors are required to report on the  auditable' part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that
part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The report is therefore
divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information. 
Part 2 of the Regulations - Unaudited Information 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Throughout the year the Committee was chaired by Alan McWalter and Peter Bertram was the other member of the
committee.  The Committee met three times in the year with all members, appointed at that time, in attendance.  The
responsibility for the establishment of a remuneration policy and its cost is a matter for the full Board, on the advice
of the Remuneration Committee. The recommendations of the Remuneration Committee have been approved without
amendment by the Board for submission to shareholders. 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for the executive directors and for
determining specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors.
The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to
be decided, no potential conflicts of interests arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in
running the business. 
The Remuneration Committee received independent advice on executive compensation from PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP (PwC ). No other services were provided to the Company by PwC during the year.  
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference with the full remit of the
Committee role described. A copy of the terms of reference is available to shareholders on request from the Company
Secretary.
REMUNERATION POLICY 2009 & 2010
The policy is designed to attract and retain individuals of the appropriate calibre, to encourage and reward high
performance. The main factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee in setting individual entitlements
under the policy are based on the role and responsibilities involved in that individual's position and the corporate
attributes of the business. The Company's comparator group is used solely to provide a point of reference for the
median level of compensation for these roles and is a secondary factor.
The Remuneration Committee believes  emphasis on performance should encourage executives to focus on delivering
the business strategy and, by providing meaningful incentives to executives, ensure that the appropriate balance
between fixed and performance related pay is maintained.  COMPARATOR GROUP 2009 & 2010        
The constituents of the Company's comparator group for 2009 and which it is currently intended to use for 2010 are:-
Alterian plc Gresham Computing plc RM plc
Dialight plc Intec Telecom Systems plc SDL plc
GB Group plc Kewill plc Trafficmaster plc
The basis of selection of the comparator group was:-
  companies in the same market sector as the Company; and
  companies with a range of market capitalisations such that the Company sits at the median of the group.
ANNUAL REVIEW OF REMUNERATION POLICY
The Remuneration Committee reviews on an annual basis whether the policy remains appropriate for the relevant
financial year. Factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee include:-
  market conditions affecting the Company;
  the need for the policy to support the Company strategy;
  the desire to ensure that the policy is balanced and in line with the Company's risk profile and does not
encourage short term risk taking at the expense of sustainable long-term value;
  the recruitment market in the Company's sector;
  changing market practice; and
  changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.  
At the 2009 annual general meeting the shareholder authority for the The Alphameric plc Executive Long-Term
Incentive Plan (the LTIP) expired. 
The Remuneration Committee therefore started in 2009 to enter into a constructive dialogue with shareholders about
replacement arrangements for 2009 and subsequent years in context of the remuneration policy as a whole in line with
best practice. The changeable business environment and the need to ensure that any new arrangements support the
strategy of the Company has meant that this process is still ongoing. The Remuneration Committee intends to continue
to maintain an open and timely dialogue with shareholders during the process of finalising replacement
arrangements.

Directors' Remuneration Report
ELEMENTS OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION 2009 (continued)
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the Executive Directors' salaries in January 2009 and increases were awarded.
The Remuneration Committee felt these increases were justified taking into account the following:-
  the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills, in organisations
of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular the median salary levels of the companies in the comparator
group;
  the performance of the individual executive director; 
  the individual executive director's experience and responsibilities; and
  pay and conditions throughout the Company. The average rise in salaries throughout the Company in 2008 was
2.5%.
Annual Performance Related Bonus - Policy 2009 & 2010 median to upper quartile
The Company's bonus plan has a maximum potential bonus of 100% of salary for the Executive Directors. It is currently
based on a Group EPS target.  A varying percentage rate of bonus is payable between the ranges of a 90% to 120%
achievement of the target EPS which would result in a bonus of between 25% to 100% of basic salary. The Company
has awarded a bonus for the 2009 financial year at the level of 50% of salary to the Executive Directors based on
achieving the EPS target set by the Remuneration Committee. 
It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that the EPS performance conditions set for 2009 were set at a level
so that their satisfaction demonstrated the achievement of a level of financial performance which was demanding and
stretching in the context of the prospects for the Company and the prevailing economic environment. 
The Remuneration Committee believes that EPS is an accurate reflection of the financial performance of the Company.
In addition EPS is a measure which can be disclosed and is transparent.
Where EPS is the performance condition the Committee will use the principles behind the audited figures disclosed in
the Company's financial statements, and may take advice from independent advisors as to whether any adjustments
are required to ensure consistency in accordance with the terms of the performance condition.
2010
The maximum bonus potential will remain at 100% of salary. Following a review of the bonus conditions it is the
Remuneration Committee's current intention to use an EPS performance condition for the 2010 annual bonus plan. 
It should be noted that the Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to reduce or reclaim payments of bonus if
performance levels on which bonus has been paid are later found to have been significantly mis-stated.
Bonus payments are not pensionable.
Share Incentives 2009
No LTIP awards or other equity based awards were made during the year. As mentioned earlier in the Report the
Remuneration Committee is in the process of reviewing the incentive elements of the remuneration policy. PENSION
Defined Contribution Plan
The Company pays the equivalent of 10% of the Executive Director's basic salary into a personal pension plan, subject
to the executive contributing 5% of basic salary (median level of pension contributions in the comparator group are
approximately 10%).
There are no defined benefit schemes in operation in the Group.
Benefits in Kind
Benefits in kind comprise a company car (or car allowance), private medical cover, income protection insurance and
death-in-service benefits.
OTHER REMUNERATION MATTERS
All Employee Share Arrangements
The Company has in place a HMRC approved Share Incentive Plan. The Plan has been closed to new contributions from
April 2009. The Plan provided employees with the opportunity of purchasing  1,500 of shares a year out of pre-tax
salary and provided additional matching shares on a 1:5 ratio (i.e. for every five shares purchased the Company
awarded 1 matching share). These matching shares will normally be released three years after they have been awarded
provided that the associated shares purchased by the employee have been retained and provided the employee is still
employed by a Group Company at this time.
Executive Directors' Contracts 
Alan Morcombe, Mike McLaren and James Soulsby each have a 12 month rolling contract dated 17 February 2003. The
contracts will continue unless terminated by a maximum of 12 months' written notice. This arrangement is in line with
best corporate practice for listed companies. In the event of the termination of an Executive's contract, salary and
benefits will be payable during the notice period (there will, however, be no automatic entitlement to bonus payments
or share incentive grants during the period of notice other than where normal good leaver provisions apply). The
Remuneration Committee will ensure that there are no unjustified payments for failure on an Executive Director's
termination of employment. 
During the year Alan Morcombe served as a director of Amalgamated Racing Limited, a company in which the Company
has a 50% indirect interest. No remuneration was received by Alan Morcombe from Amalgamated Racing Limited in
relation to this directorship. 
Non-Executive Directors: Policy 2009 & 2010 Median level fees
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board based upon recommendations from the
Chairman and Chief Executive (or, in the case of the Chairman, based on recommendations from the Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee following independent advice) and is within the limits set by the Company's articles of
association. Having reviewed the policy it was decided that both the Executive and Non Executive Directors
remuneration should be set at the median level.

The performance conditions for the LTIP's awarded are that the Company's EPS growth over the three year performance
period must be equal to or greater than RPI+3% per annum before any of the award is capable of release. On the
satisfaction of this condition the release of the award is dependent on the Company's total shareholder return
performance against the comparator group. 30% of the award will be released for median comparative performance
with 100% being released for upper quartile performance.
The 2006 LTIP awards (detailed above) lapsed on the 5 December 2009 because the performance conditions were not
satisfied on the third anniversary of the date of grant.
