Remuneration Report

Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors'
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which has introduced new
statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors' remuneration in
respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002. The report
also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied
the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors' remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will
be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which
the financial statements will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company's
members on the  auditable part' of the Directors' Remuneration Report
and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as
amended by the Regulations). The report has therefore been divided
into separate sections for un-audited and audited information.
Un-audited Information
Remuneration Committee 
( the Committee')
The Board of Directors has delegated responsibility for remuneration
policy to the Remuneration Committee.
The role of the Committee is to establish and review the remuneration 
and terms of employment of the executive Directors including the
approval of grants of Executive Share Options. The Committee is
comprised of the non-executive Directors: Iain Johnston (Chairman of 
the Committee), Keith Hamill, and Hugh McCartney. The Committee is
authorised by the Board to investigate any matters within its terms of
reference. None of the Committee has conflicts of interest arising from
cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in the running of the
business. The Chief Executive attends meetings of the Committee by
invitation and is consulted by it on proposals to the remuneration of the
other executive Directors. The Committee has access to professional
advice from inside and outside the Company and makes recommendations
to the Board. During the year there have been no external consultancies
that have materially assisted the committee. No Director plays any part in
any discussions about their own remuneration.
Terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available for
inspection by any person at the Company's registered office during
normal business hours.
Remuneration Policy
The Committee and the Board believe that in order to attract and
maintain a senior management team of the right calibre who will 
make a significant contribution to maximising shareholder value, it 
is necessary to provide a competitive remuneration structure. The
Board's policy for executive remuneration is designed to:
  ensure that Directors' rewards are competitive when compared with
similar companies;
  recognise the growth plans for the Group and align the interests of
Directors and shareholders;
  give executive Directors the opportunity to increase their earnings 
by achieving and exceeding key performance objectives;
  ensure that the executive Directors are fairly rewarded for their
individual contribution to the overall performance of the Group.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for 
executive Directors:
  basic annual salary and benefits;
  annual performance bonuses;
  pension arrangements; and
  share option incentives. Basic Salary
An executive Director's basic salary is reviewed by the Committee to 
take effect from 1 April of each year and on any change of responsibility.
In deciding levels of salary the Committee considers the Group as a
whole and relies on objective research from third party surveys. It then
considers a salary that will reward, motivate and retain the individual as
is appropriate for their experience and level of responsibility.
Other Benefits
Benefits for executives principally comprise a car (or car allowance),
fuel, permanent health cover, private medical insurance and a death in
service benefit of four times salary.
Annual Performance Bonuses
The Committee establishes the objectives that must be met for each
financial year if a cash bonus is to be paid. In setting appropriate
parameters the Committee refers to the objective research on a
comparator group of companies. The Committee believes that any
incentive compensation awarded should be tied into the interests of the
Company's shareholders and that the principal measure of those
interests is progress in strategic developments for the business, and
profitability. The bonuses for 2005/2006 were capped at 75% of basic
salary. This cap remains the same for 2006/2007.
Directors' Pension Arrangements/Long Term Incentives
None of the Directors are members of an Alterian pension scheme or
long term incentive plan. Each of the executive Directors are entitled 
to receive a pension contribution equal to 10% of basic salary in lieu 
of Company contributions. 
Employee Share Schemes
The Group operates two employee share option plans and two employee
share purchase plans. These schemes are an important part of the
performance related remuneration of executive Directors and
employees, encouraging them to continue to contribute towards the
continuing growth in performance of the Group by participating in the
Group's success.
Share Option Plans
The Alterian Share Option Plan is divided into two parts. Part A of the
plan has been approved by the Inland Revenue as an employee share
scheme under the Income and Taxes Act 1988. As at 31 March 2006
131,600 options are under grant under Part A. Part B of the plan
constitutes an unapproved share option scheme. As at 31 March 2006
2,454,835 options are under grant to UK employees under part B of
the scheme.
The options granted under this plan for 2005/2006 are subject to the
following performance condition which is now time limited for
attainment:
  no option can be exercised until the cumulative undiluted earnings
per share for the four quarters immediately preceding exercise is 
not less than 8p per Ordinary Share. This condition must be obtained
within three years following the year of grant.
For grants made before March 2003 the performance condition was set
so that no option can be exercised until positive cumulative undiluted
earnings per share for the four quarters immediately preceding exercise
has been attained.
For grants made during 2003/2004 the performance condition was
increased so that the cumulative undiluted earnings per share for the
four quarters immediately preceding exercise should be not less than
2.5p per Ordinary Share.
For grants made during 2004/2005 the performance condition was
again increased so that the cumulative undiluted earnings per share 
for the four quarters immediately preceding exercise should be not 
less than 5p per Ordinary Share.
These options are exercisable at any time between the third and tenth
anniversaries of the date of grant subject to the performance measure
above, provided that the employees remain employed by the Group.
Part B of the plan extends to the directors and employees of Alterian
Inc. As such, the plan incorporates a Non-statutory Stock Option Plan
( US NSO Schedule') and a second schedule which is an Incentive
Stock Option Plan ( US ISO Schedule') which will normally confer tax
relief on US participating employees. As at 31 March 2006 233,081
options are under grant under the US NSO Schedule and 672,786
under grant under the US ISO Schedule.

Employee Share Schemes (continued)
In accordance with local market practice in the US, performance
conditions were not applied to the exercise of options under either of
the US NSO or the US ISO up until March 2004. The options granted
under this scheme after March 2004 are now subject to the same
performance criteria as described before for Part A of the Alterian Share
Option Plan. The Board will determine at its discretion the individual
limits to be applied to individuals who are granted options under the 
US plans. In any event, the aggregate market value of the shares for
which one or more options granted to any Participant under the US ISO,
for the first time become exercisable during any one calendar year, shall
not exceed $100,000. Options will vest at a rate of one-third per annum,
commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Options may
only be exercised by staff within ten years of the date of grant, provided
they remain employed by the Group, otherwise they will lapse.
Enterprise Management Incentives Scheme (EMI Scheme)
The purpose of this scheme is to ensure the continuing success of the
Group by aligning the interests of key employees and shareholders and
allowing employees to share in the value they create through the grant
of share options. There is currently an overriding limit that each Option
Holder cannot receive more than  100,000 of any approved options in
a three year period from the date of grant of the options that took the
Option Holder to the limit. As at 31 March 2006 947,955 options are
under grant under the Scheme.
The options granted under this scheme are subject to the same
performance criteria as described above for Part A of the Alterian 
Share Option Plan.
These options are exercisable at any time between the second and 
tenth anniversaries of the date of grant of that option, subject to the
performance criteria above.
Under Schedule 14 of the Finance Act 2000 there is currently an
overriding limit to the value of unexercised options of  3 million.
Share Incentive Plan
The Board believes that extending and encouraging employee share
ownership throughout the Group will encourage all employees to identify
more closely with the interests of shareholders and will also give them the
opportunity to share in the shareholder value they create in a tax-efficient
manner. The Company Share Incentive Plan (SIP) was set up in August
2001 for all UK employees. As at 31 March 2006 the SIP had 55
members holding 475,899 shares through the Trust.
Employee Benefit Trust
The Group has established an off-shore employee benefit trust (EBT).
The Group has the ability to use the EBT to acquire shares in the Group
for the satisfaction of share rights granted to its beneficiaries.
US Restricted Share Plan
This plan will enable the Group to increase its capacity to reward and
retain employees of Alterian Inc. Under this plan US employees will be
awarded restricted shares. Awards are subject to continued employment
with certain forfeiture provisions. The Board determines at its discretion
the level of award to be made to an individual under this plan. In any
event, the aggregate market value of the shares awarded will not exceed
the Participant's annual salary at the date of award. As at 31 March
2006 47,350 shares are held under this plan.
Scheme Limits
The number of shares which have been issued or may become issuable
pursuant to either options granted, shares allocated or shares awarded
on any date when added to the number of shares issued and remaining
issuable in respect of rights conferred in the previous 10 years in any of
the share schemes for the Group's employees may not exceed 15% of
the number of shares in issue immediately before that date. This limit
was approved by shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held
on 18 July 2001.
Rights of Shares and Listing
All shares that the Group issues or allots through the plans will rank 
pari passu with the shares then in issue, except that they shall not rank
for dividend or other rights declared by reference to a record date prior
to the exercise or issue date. The Group will apply to the UK Listing
Authority for any shares issued pursuant to the plans to be admitted 
to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange.  Under the Group's Employee Share Option Schemes employees held options at 31 March 2006 as follows:
