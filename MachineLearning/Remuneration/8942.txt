Cash equivalents are held in a variety of short dated sterling instruments
and deposits actively managed by independent managers to maximise the
return consistent with the Group's stringent risk criteria. Regular reports
are produced and the returns and investments are compared with both
benchmark targets and competitor returns.
21. Deferred Taxation
A deferred tax asset of  650,000 (2006:  250,000) has been recognised
in respect of tax losses and  400,000 has been credited to the Income
Statement during the year.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets at 31 March 2007 are  5,427,000
(2006:  5,866,000) relating to short term timing differences, share
based payments and tax losses. These will be realised as and when they
reverse against suitable future taxable profits.
At the balance sheet date the Group has unused tax losses of  17.9m
(2006:  17.8m) available for offset against future profits. A deferred tax
asset has been recognised in respect of  2.2m (2006:  0.8m) of such
losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the
remaining  15.7m (2006:  17.0m) as the Group is in the early stages 
of emerging into profitability and it would be imprudent to assume the
amount and timing of further future profit streams for this purpose at this
time. Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of  7.4m (2006:
 7.8m) that may expire between 2016 and 2019.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
