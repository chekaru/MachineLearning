25. Acquisition of Subsidiaries
Dynamics Direct Inc
On 25 May 2006 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Dynamics Direct Inc ( DDI'). The total cost of acquisition was approximately
 3.3m and has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting. As part of the consideration 1,257,042 shares, with a fair value of  1.23m,
were issued. The fair value was calculated as the market value of the shares as at the date of acquisition.
The carrying amounts of each class of DDI's assets and liabilities before the combination are set out below:
Fair Carrying
value value prior to
acquisition
Description  000  000
Intangible assets 344 0
Property, plant and equipment 11
Trade and other receivables 132 143
Cash and cash equivalents (bank accounts) 51 51
Trade and other payables (excluding bank accounts) (184) (60)
Net assets acquired 344 135
Goodwill 2,911
Cost 3,255
Satisfied by
Cash consideration 972
Costs of acquisition 528
Deferred consideration 529
Issue of shares 1,226
3,255
The initial consideration paid by Alterian on completion was  2.73m satisfied by the payment of  1.5m in cash (including costs), and the issue of
1,257,042 new shares in Alterian. The cash element of the initial consideration was satisfied out of Alterian's existing cash resources. An additional
consideration of up to  0.53m subject to the achievement of certain revenue targets by DDI for the period from completion to 31 March 2007, will be
payable in cash on achievement of those targets.
Goodwill amounts to approximately  2.9m a value supported by the estimated cashflows arising from future sales of DDI's product. The value attributed
to other intangible assets is  344k reflecting the value placed upon the intellectual property element of the consideration at the date of acquisition.
The full amount of the profit or loss of DDI since the acquisition has not been identified as the business has been partially absorbed into other group
activities so certain overheads cannot be reliably allocated to DDI. 
The original consideration of $5.5m was translated into sterling at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. This amount then increased by the costs
associated with the acquisition to give the total cost shown above of  3.3m. 69 Notes to the Financial Statements This is marketing

25. Acquisition of Subsidiaries (continued) 
Nvigorate Limited
On 11 September 2006 the Group acquired 100% of the issued 
share capital of Nvigorate Limited. The total cost of acquisition was
approximately  1.47m comprising consideration of  467k and net
liabilities assumed of  1m. This transaction has been accounted for 
by the purchase method of accounting.
The carrying amounts of each class of Nvigorate's assets and liabilities
before the combination are set out below:
Fair Carrying
value value prior to
acquisition
Description  000  000

Net liabilities acquired (1,002) (780)
Goodwill 1,469
Cost 467
Satisfied by
Costs of acquisition 167
Deferred consideration 300
467
The initial consideration paid by Alterian on completion was  167k
satisfied by the payment of cash. In addition there was an immediate
working capital outflow of  1,133k representing the settlement of
overdue creditors and loans.
Deferred consideration of up to  300k in cash will be payable subject 
to the achievement of certain performance targets for the period to 30
September 2007 on achievement of those targets.
Goodwill amounts to approximately  1.47m, a value supported by the
estimated cashflows of the future business. The value attributed to 
other intangible assets is nil reflecting the net cash flows of the 
legacy business.
The amount of the profit or loss of Nvigorate since the acquisition date
has not been identified as the business was immediately combined with
other group activities so the impact cannot be determined.
Because both businesses have been absorbed into other group activities 
it is impracticable to disclose the revenue and profits of the combined
entities for the period as though the acquisition date for all business
combinations in the period had been at the beginning of the period.

Equity-settled share option plan
The Group plans provide for a grant price equal to the average quoted
price of the Group shares for the 3 days before date of grant. The 
vesting period is generally 3 to 5 years. If the options remain unexercised
after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group 
before the options vest.
Details of the share options outstanding under IFRS 2 during the year and
prior year are as follows:

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options
exercised during the period was 91 pence. The options outstanding at 
31 March 2007 had a weighted average exercise price of 79 pence, and 
a weighted average remaining contractual life of 8.4 years.
Details of the range of exercise prices are provided within the Directors'
Remuneration Report.
NOTES TO THE 
FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
During the year to 31 March 2007, options were granted on 25 July 2006, 19 September 2006, 14 February 2007 and 22 March 2007. The aggregate
of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates which are still outstanding at 31 March 2007 is  388,947. In the year to 31 March
2006, options were granted on 22 April 2005, 28 July 2005, 3 November 2005 and 1 February 2006. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of
the options granted on those dates which are still outstanding at 31 March 2006 is  101,730.
The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows for options granted and still outstanding at each year end:
2007 2006
Weighted average share price 97p 104p
Weighted average exercise price 97p 104p
Expected volatility 26% 34%
Expected life 5 years 5 years
Risk free rate 4.5% 4.5%
Expected dividends N/A N/A
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group's share price over the previous 3 years prior to each date of grant.
The Group recognised total expenses of  163,000 and  154,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2007 and 
2006 respectively.
There is no share based payment in the Company.
29. Retirement Benefit Scheme
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme covering its permanent UK employees. Scheme funds are administered by trustees and are
independent of the Group's finances. Where there are employees who leave the scheme prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the contributions
payable by the Group are reduced by the amount of the forfeited contributions.
The Group has contributed 5.5% of members' gross salaries to the scheme since 1 October 2001. The pension cost charge represents contributions
payable by the Group to the fund and amounted to  119,000 (2006:  89,000).
Some UK employees receive an enhancement to salary of between 5% and 10% of gross pay in lieu of Company contributions. This amounted to
 85,000 (2006:  90,000).
US employees contribute to a 401k scheme. They receive an additional 25% of their contribution. This amounted to  34,000 (2006:  24,000). 73 Five Year Summary This is marketing

The Directors will seek approval for the Directors' Remuneration Report
for the year ended 31 March 2007. Please refer to pages 34 to 41 of the
Annual Report for the full text.
Resolutions 3 to 5 - Re-election of Directors retiring by rotation
One-third of the Directors must retire each year, though they may offer
themselves for re-election. This year David Eldridge, David Cutler and 
Iain Johnston are retiring and seeking re-election. Please refer to page 
26 of the Annual Report for biographical details. David Eldridge is the
Chief Executive Officer, David Cutler is the Group Finance Director and
Iain Johnston is a Non-executive Director. 
Resolution 6 - Re-appointment of Auditors
The Directors will seek approval for the re-appointment of Deloitte and
Touche LLP as the Company's Auditors.
Resolution 7 - Authority to allot shares
An Ordinary Resolution will be proposed to give the Directors authority 
to allot part of the unissued Ordinary Share Capital of the Company. In
accordance with Institutional Shareholders' Committee guidelines, any
such authority should be limited by reference to the issued Ordinary Share
Capital of the Company. In broad terms, such authority should be limited
in amount equal to one third of the existing issued Ordinary Share Capital
of the Company.
Resolution 8 - Disapplication of pre-emption rights
A Special Resolution will be proposed to empower Directors to allot
securities of the Company up to a specified amount in connection with
rights issues without having to obtain prior approval from shareholders on
each occasion and also to allot a small number of these for cash without
first being required to offer such shares to existing shareholders. In
accordance with Institutional Shareholders' Committee guidelines, the
number of Ordinary shares which may be issued for cash under the latter
authority should not exceed five per cent of the Ordinary Share Capital of
the Company in issue immediately following the date of the resolution.
Resolution 9 - Market purchase of shares
Under the Company's Articles of Association and Section 162 of the
Companies Act 1985, the Company is empowered to purchase its own
shares. Resolution 9 is proposed as a Special Resolution to enable the
Company to purchase, for cancellation and/or for holding in treasury,
Ordinary shares in the market for the period until the conclusion of the
Company's Annual General Meeting to be held in 2008, upon the terms
set out in the resolution up to a maximum number of 2,107,426 Ordinary
shares (representing approximately five per cent of the issued Ordinary
Share Capital of the Company).
Resolution 10 - Refusal to register share transfer
Under the provisions of section 771 of the Companies Act 2006, from 
1 April 2008, in the event that the Directors of the Company refuse to
register a transfer of shares they must provide the transferee with their
reasons for that refusal. The proposed amendment to Articles 40.1 and 
41 of the Articles of Association ensures that the Company's Articles of
Association reflect the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Resolution 11 - Electronic Communications
Under the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is
permitted to supply documents and information to its members by way 
of electronic communication - particularly by means of e-mail and web
site communication. The principal change to the previous law is that the
Company can supply documents and information to its members by
publishing those documents on its web-site, provided that each member
has been asked individually by the Company to agree to such method of
communication, and the Company has not received a negative response
within 28 days of that request.
The proposed amendments to Articles 152, 153 and 155 of the
Company's Articles of Association permit the Company to communicate
through electronic means, and set out the deemed delivery provisions in
circumstances where electronic communications are used. It is intended
that this should give the Company the flexibility to communicate with its
members by electronic means should it choose to do so. In the event that
the Company chooses in the future to send documents and information 
to members via its web site, the members will be contacted and their
consent sought on an individual basis. Even in these circumstances,
members will remain entitled to receive documents in hard copy if they 
so request. Notes
