Directors' Remuneration Report
Directors' Remuneration Report
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006. The report
also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the
Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors' remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report 
will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company's members on the  auditable part' of the Directors' Remuneration Report and 
to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting Regulations. 
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited Information
Remuneration Committee (the Committee)
The Board of Directors has delegated responsibility for remuneration
policy to the Remuneration Committee. The role of the Committee is
to establish and review the remuneration and terms of employment
of the executive Directors, to review the remuneration of other
executives to determine the remuneration of the Chairman and 
to approve share incentive schemes and grants of options under
those schemes.
The Committee comprises, Hugh McCartney (Chairman of the
Committee), Keith Hamill, and Alastair Gordon. Iain Johnston 
stood down as a member of the committee in April 2010. The Chief
Executive attends meetings of the Committee by invitation and is
consulted by it on proposals for the remuneration of the other
executive Directors. The Committee has access to professional
advice from inside and outside the Company. During the year there
have been no external consultancies that have materially assisted
the Committee but it has considered published external surveys of
comparable information. No Director plays any part in any
discussions about their own remuneration.
Terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available
for inspection by any person at the Company's registered office
during normal business hours.
Remuneration Policy
The Committee and the Board believe that in order to attract and
maintain a senior management team of the right calibre who will
make a significant contribution to maximising shareholder value, 
it is necessary to provide a competitive remuneration structure.
The Board's policy for executive remuneration is designed to:
  ensure that Directors' rewards are competitive when compared
with similar companies;
  recognise the growth plans for the Group and align the interests
of Directors and shareholders;
  give executive Directors the opportunity to increase their
earnings by achieving and exceeding key performance 
objectives; and
  ensure that the executive Directors are fairly rewarded for their
individual contribution to the overall performance of the Group.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for
executive Directors:
  basic annual salary and benefits;
  annual performance bonuses;
  pension arrangements; and
  share option incentives.
Basic Salary
An executive Director's basic salary is reviewed by the Committee
to take effect from 1 April of each year and on any change of
responsibility. In deciding levels of salary the Committee considers
the Group as a whole and relies on objective research from third
party surveys. It then considers a salary that will reward, motivate
and retain the individual as is appropriate for their experience and
level of responsibility.
Other Benefits
Benefits for executives may include car allowance, international
work allowance, fuel, permanent health cover, private medical and
dental insurance and a death in service benefit of four times salary.
Annual Performance Bonuses
The Committee establishes the objectives that must be met for
each financial year if a cash bonus is to be paid. In setting
appropriate parameters the Committee refers to the objective
research on a comparator group of companies. The Committee
believes that any incentive compensation awarded should be 
tied into the interests of the Company's shareholders and that 
the principal measure of those interests is progress in strategic
developments for the business together with profitability and 
cash generation. The executive Director bonuses for the year
ended 31 March 2010 were for a maximum of 80% of salary, 
with on target budget performance giving a bonus of two thirds 
of salary. The bonus targets comprised 35% of salary for revenue,
35% for profit before tax and amortisation and 10% for a specific
operational objective. Of the maximum bonus 35% related to first
half performance.
Directors' Pension Arrangements/Long Term Incentives
None of the Directors are members of an Alterian pension scheme
or long term incentive plan. Each of the executive Directors is
entitled to receive a pension contribution equal to 10% of basic
salary in lieu of Company contributions.
Employee Share Schemes
The Group operates two employee share option plans and two
employee share purchase plans. These schemes are an important
part of the performance related remuneration of executive
Directors and employees encouraging them to continue to
contribute towards the continuing growth in performance of 
the Group by participating in the Group's success. 40

Pre March 2003 No option can be exercised until positive cumulative undiluted 
earnings per share for the four quarters immediately preceding 
exercise has been attained
These options are exercisable at any time between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant subject to the performance
measure above, provided that the employees remain employed by the Group. The performance conditions relating to options issued 
prior to 31 March 2008 have been met. 
The Alterian Share Option Plan is divided into two parts. Part A of the plan has been approved by the Inland Revenue as an employee
share scheme under the Income and Taxes Act 1988. As at 31 March 2010, 566,696 options are under grant within Part A. Part B of the
plan constitutes an unapproved share option scheme. As at 31 March 2010, 1,340,187 options are under grant to UK employees within
Part B of the scheme. 
Part B of the plan extends to employees outside the UK. 230,000 options are under grant to employees based in Europe, India and Asia-
Pacific. Within the US, the plan incorporates a Non-statutory Stock Option Plan ( US NSO Schedule') and a second schedule which is an
Incentive Stock Option Plan ( US ISO Schedule') which will normally confer tax relief on US participating employees. As at 31 March 2010,
503,812 options are under grant under the US NSO Schedule and 881,058 under grant under the US ISO Schedule.
The options granted under this scheme after March 2004 are subject to the same performance criteria as described before for Part A 
of the Alterian Share Option Plan. In accordance with local market practice in the US, performance conditions were not applied to 
the exercise of options under either of the US NSO or the US ISO up until March 2004. The Board will determine at its discretion the
individual limits to be applied to individuals who are granted options under the US plans. In any event, the aggregate market value of the
shares for which one or more options granted to any participant under the US ISO, for the first time become exercisable during any one
calendar year, shall not exceed $100,000. Options will vest at a rate of one-third per annum, commencing on the first anniversary of the
date of grant. Options may only be exercised by staff within ten years of the date of grant, provided they remain employed by the Group,
otherwise they will lapse. The technology to engage

Directors' Remuneration Report
Enterprise Management Incentives Scheme (EMI Scheme)
No options have been issued in the year to 31 March 2010, as 
the Group no longer qualifies to grant options under this scheme. 
As at 31 March 2010, 541,717 options are under grant.
The options granted under this scheme are subject to the same
performance criteria as described above for Part A of the Alterian
Share Option Plan and options are exercisable at any time between
the second and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant of that
option, subject to the performance criteria above.
Share Incentive Plan
The Board believes that extending and encouraging employee share
ownership throughout the Group will encourage all employees to
identify more closely with the interests of shareholders and will also
give them the opportunity to share in the shareholder value they
create in a tax-efficient manner. The Company Share Incentive Plan
(SIP) was set up in August 2001 for all UK employees. As at 31 March
2010, the SIP had 86 members holding 609,606 shares through 
the Trust.
Employee Benefit Trust
The Group has established an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). 
The Group has the ability to use the EBT to acquire shares in 
the Group for the satisfaction of share rights granted to its
beneficiaries. As at 31 March 2010, 185,393 shares were held 
by the Trust.
US Restricted Share Plan
This plan enables the Group to increase its capacity to reward and
retain employees of Alterian, Inc. Under this plan, US employees 
are awarded restricted shares. Awards are subject to continued
employment with certain forfeiture provisions. The Board determines
at its discretion the level of award to be made to an individual under
this plan. In any event, the aggregate market value of the shares
awarded will not exceed the participant's annual salary at the date 
of award. As at 31 March 2010, 65,998 shares are held under this 
plan through the EBT.
Scheme limits
The number of shares which have been issued or may become
issuable pursuant to either options granted, shares allocated or
shares awarded on any date when added to the number of shares
issued and remaining issuable in respect of rights conferred in 
the previous ten years in any of the share schemes for the Group's
employees may not exceed 15% of the numbers of shares in 
issue immediately before that date. This limit was approved by
shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 
18 July 2001.
Rights of shares and listing
All shares that the Group issues or allots through the plans will rank
pari passu with the shares then in issue, except that they shall not
rank for dividend or other rights declared by reference to a record
date prior to the exercise or issue date. The Group will apply to the
UK Listing Authority for any shares issued pursuant to the plans to
be admitted to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange. 42
