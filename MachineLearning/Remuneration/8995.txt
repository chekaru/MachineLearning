Directors' Remuneration Report 
 
Introduction 
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 
2006. The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and 
describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors  remuneration. As required 
by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company 
at which the financial statements will be approved. 
 
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company s members on the  auditable part  of the Directors  Remuneration 
Report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Accounting Regulations. The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited 
information. 
 
Unaudited Information 
 
Remuneration Committee ( the Committee') 
The Board of Directors has delegated responsibility for remuneration policy to the Remuneration Committee. The role of 
the Committee is to establish and review the remuneration and terms of employment of the Executive Directors, to 
review the remuneration of other Executives, to determine the remuneration of the Chairman and to approve share 
incentive schemes and grants of options under those schemes. 
 
The Committee comprises, Hugh McCartney (Chairman of the Committee), and Alastair Gordon. Keith Hamill and Iain 
Johnston stood down as a member of the committee in April 2010. The Chief Executive attends meetings of the 
Committee by invitation and is consulted by it on proposals for the remuneration of the other Executive Directors. The 
Committee has access to professional advice from inside and outside the Company. During the year there have been no 
external consultancies that have materially assisted the committee but it has considered published external surveys of 
comparable information. No Director plays any part in any discussions about their own remuneration. 
 
Terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available for inspection by any person at the Company s 
registered office during normal business hours. 
 
Remuneration Policy 
The Board s policy for executive remuneration is designed to: 
 
  ensure that Directors  rewards are competitive when compared with similar companies; 
  align the interests of Directors and shareholders; 
  give executive Directors the opportunity to increase their earnings by achieving and exceeding key performance 
objectives; and 
  ensure that the executive Directors are fairly rewarded for their individual contribution to the overall performance of 
the Group. 
 
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive Directors: 
 
  basic annual salary and benefits; 
  annual performance bonuses; 
  pension arrangements; and 
  share option incentives. 
 
Basic Salary 
An executive Director s basic salary is reviewed by the Committee to take effect from 1 April of each year and on any 
change of responsibility. In deciding levels of salary the Committee considers the Group as a whole and relies on 
objective research from third party surveys. It then considers a salary that will reward, motivate and retain the individual 
as is appropriate for their experience and level of responsibility. 
 
Other Benefits 
Benefits for executives may include car allowance, international work allowance, fuel, permanent health cover, private 
medical and dental insurance and a death in service benefit of four times salary.

Annual Performance Bonuses 
The Committee establishes the objectives that must be met for each financial year if a cash bonus is to be paid. In 
setting appropriate parameters the Committee refers to the objective research on a comparator group of companies. 
The Committee believes that any incentive compensation awarded should be tied into the interests of the Company s 
shareholders and that the principal measure of those interests is progress in strategic developments for the business 
together with profitability and cash generation.  
 
The Executive Director bonuses for the year ended 31 March 2011 were for a maximum of 80% of salary, with on target 
budget performance giving a bonus of two thirds of salary. The bonus targets comprised 35% of salary for revenue, 35% 
for profit before tax and amortisation and 10% for a specific operational objective. Of the maximum bonus 35% related to 
first half performance. The payment of half yearly bonuses arose from a policy of endeavoring to reduce over 
concentration of revenues in the second half and is subject to review for the year to March 2012. 
 
Directors' Pension Arrangements 
None of the Directors are members of an Alterian pension scheme. Each of the executive Directors is entitled to receive 
a pension contribution equal to 10% of basic salary in lieu of Company contributions. 
 
Employee Share Schemes 
The Group operates two employee share option plans and two employee share purchase plans. These schemes are an 
important part of the performance related remuneration of executive Directors and employees, encouraging them to 
continue to contribute towards the continuing growth in performance of the Group by participating in the Group s 
success. 
 
Share Option Plans 
 
The options granted under these plans are subject to the following performance condition: 
 
Cumulative undiluted earnings per share for two successive half year periods preceding exercise is not less than the 
performance condition price per ordinary share excluding amortisation of acquired intangible assets and exceptional 
costs. Since 2005/06 the performance condition is time limited for attainment and must be achieved within three years 
following the year of grant.

Share Option Plans (continued) 
 
The Alterian Share Option Plan is divided into two parts. Part A of the plan has been approved by the Inland Revenue as 
an employee share scheme under the Income and Taxes Act 1988. As at 31 March 2011, 566,610 options are under 
grant within Part A. Part B of the plan constitutes an unapproved share option scheme. As at 31 March 2011 1,667,196 
options are under grant to UK employees within Part B of the scheme. 
 
Part B of the plan extends to employees outside the UK. 240,000 options are under grant to employees based in 
Europe, India and Asia Pac. Within the US, the plan incorporates a Non-statutory Stock Option Plan ( US NSO 
Schedule ) and a second schedule which is an Incentive Stock Option Plan ( US ISO Schedule ) which will normally 
confer tax relief on US participating employees. As at 31 March 2011, 685,908 options are under grant under the US 
NSO Schedule and 1,108,962 under grant under the US ISO Schedule. 
 
The options granted under the US scheme after March 2004 are subject to the same performance criteria as described 
before for Part A and Part B of the Alterian Share Option Plan. In accordance with local market practice in the US, 
performance conditions were not applied to the exercise of options under either of the US NSO or the US ISO up until 
March 2004. The Board will determine at its discretion the individual limits to be applied to individuals who are granted 
options under the US plans. In any event, the aggregate market value of the shares for which one or more options 
granted to any participant under the US ISO, for the first time become exercisable during any one calendar year, shall 
not exceed $100,000. Options granted up to 31 March 2010 will vest at a rate of one-third per annum, commencing on 
the first anniversary of the date of grant. Options granted after this date are exercisable at any time between the third 
and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant of that option, subject to the performance criteria above. Options may only 
be exercised by staff within ten years of the date of grant, provided they remain employed by the Group, otherwise they 
will lapse. 
 
Enterprise Management Incentives Scheme (EMI Scheme) 
No options have been issued in the year to 31 March 2011, as the Group no longer qualifies to grant options under this 
scheme. As at 31 March 2011, 415,917 options are under grant. 
 
The options granted under this scheme are subject to the same performance criteria as described above for Part A of 
the Alterian Share Option Plan and options are exercisable at any time between the second and tenth anniversaries of 
the date of grant of that option, subject to the performance criteria above. 
 
Share Incentive Plan 
The Company Share Incentive Plan (SIP) was set up in August 2001 for all UK employees. As at 31 March 2011, the 
SIP had 97 members holding 616,281 shares through the Trust. 
 
Employee Benefit Trust 
The Group has established an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). The Group has the ability to use the EBT to acquire 
shares in the Group for the satisfaction of share rights granted to its beneficiaries. As at 31 March 2011 185,393 shares 
were held by the Trust. 
 
US Restricted Share Plan 
This plan enables the Group to increase its capacity to reward and retain employees of Alterian, Inc. Under this plan, US 
employees are awarded restricted shares. Awards are subject to continued employment with certain forfeiture 
provisions. The Board determines at its discretion the level of award to be made to an individual under this plan. In any 
event, the aggregate market value of the shares awarded will not exceed the participant s annual salary at the date of 
award. As at 31 March 2011, 65,998 shares are held under this plan through the EBT. 
 
Scheme limits 
The number of shares which have been issued or may become issuable pursuant to either options granted, shares 
allocated or shares awarded on any date when added to the number of shares issued and remaining issuable in respect 
of rights conferred in the previous ten years in any of the share schemes for the Group s employees may not exceed 
15% of the numbers of shares in issue immediately before that date. The Board will endeavour to ensure that the 
number of shares under option by the close of the scheme does not exceed 10%.This limit was approved by 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 23 July 2010. 
 
Rights of shares and listing 
All shares that the Group issues or allots through the plans will rank pari passu with the shares then in issue, except that 
they shall not rank for dividend or other rights declared by reference to a record date prior to the exercise or issue date. 
The Group will apply to the UK Listing Authority for any shares issued pursuant to the plans to be admitted to the Official 
List of the London Stock Exchange.

The Service agreement for Guy Millward is subject to 24 months  written notice from the Company, reducing by one 
month for each completed month s service with the Company for the initial 12 months of the agreement. The initial 
notice period reflected speculation about the possible sale of the business at the time he was recruited. On serving

salary for the unexpired portion of the contractual notice entitlement. This service agreement is subject to 6 months

the Company.

to 7.5% of basic salary, a pension contribution equal to 10% of basic salary, permanent health cover, private medical 
insurance and a death in service benefit of four times salary. In addition, where it is agreed that any Director is required 
to spend extended periods abroad, an international work allowance is made available to that Director. 
 
Performance Graph 
The following graph shows the Company s performance over the past five years to 30 April 2011 measured by total 
shareholder return, compared with the performance of the FTSE techMARK 100 and FTSE Small Cap indices also 
measured by total shareholder return. The FTSE techMARK 100 index represents the medium and small technology 
companies excluding the largest companies, and Alterian is quoted within the FTSE Small Cap index. These indices 
have been selected for this comparison as the Directors consider them to be the most suitable comparators.
