Scope of the report
The Remuneration report summarises the Group's
remuneration policy and particularly its application
in connection with the Directors. The report also
describes how the Group applies the principles of
good corporate governance in relation to Directors'
remuneration. 
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is appointed by the
Board and comprises only Non-executive Directors,
including the Non-executive Chairman. The Committee
meets regularly to determine, on behalf of the
Board, the framework of executive remuneration. 
Prior to February 2005, the Committee consisted of
two Non-executive Directors, Tony Caplin and Timothy
Holland-Bosworth, with Kenneth McGeorge joining
the Committee as Chairman in February 2005.
During the current year, the Committee met on one
occasion, with the attendance of all members.
The Committee's terms of reference are reviewed
regularly and approved by the Board. These are
available for inspection at the Group's registered
address.
The members of this Committee do not have any
personal financial interests or any conflicts from
cross-directorships that relate to the business of the
Committee. The members do not have any day to
day involvement in the running of the Group.
Kenneth McGeorge is the sole member not
regarded as being independent for the reason that
he is the Group's Non-executive Chairman.
To assist the work of the Committee, the views of
the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer
and Head of Human Resources are also invited
where appropriate. These individuals did not
however participate in any decision related to their
own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The Group is committed to the governing objective
of maximising shareholder value over time. Each
year the remuneration framework and the packages
of the Directors are reviewed to ensure they continue
to achieve this objective.
The Group's policy is to attract, retain and incentivise
Executive Directors to run the Group and meet the
expectations of shareholders whilst adopting a
prudent approach to overall remuneration. 
Basic salary and benefits
The Group's policy for Executive Directors' salaries
is that they should be maintained at competitive
levels for those in comparable positions, with
variations to reflect individual performance,
experience and job size. Benefits in kind consist of
private medical and health insurance, employer
pension contributions and health club membership.
Employee Benefit Trust ( EBT')
An EBT was established and Jim Sewell, Edward
Spurrier and Ben Marnham were each awarded
interests in 638,400,  0.00125p shares held by the trust.
These shares are held on trust for them absolutely
subject to the trustees retaining a lien on the shares.
The lien is in respect of the trustees' obligation to
settle the loan from the company used to acquire
the shares (which is the equivalent to  277,000
each,  831,000 being the total loan) plus any premium.
The premium arises in the event that the lien is
settled within the initial two year period and is equal
to the increase in the value of the shares at that time.
All employee share and share option plans 
The Group's Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI)
2004 scheme was adopted on the 22 December
2004. Under the Group's EMI Scheme, options
which are qualifying options under the Enterprise
Management Incentive regime and also unapproved
options may be granted. As at the 30 September
2005, options were outstanding over a total of
2,044,000 ordinary shares. 
The options under the scheme can be exercised from
31 December 2006 based on the conditions that the
option holder is still an employee of Alternative
Networks plc and the Group has achieved certain
performance criteria in the period 1 October 2004 to
30 September 2006. The exercise price is the higher
of  0.25p per share and the market value at the date
of the grant.
Service Agreements
Each of the Executive Directors has a Service
Agreement with the Group. These are rolling
agreements which can be terminated by either party
giving not less than 6 months notice in writing at any
time. If the Group terminates the contract by notice
but other than on giving full notice, the Service
Agreements provide for the payment of the fixed
amount equal to the salary and other contractual
benefits for the unexpired proportion of the duration
of the appointment or entitlement to notice, as the
case may be. It is the Committee's view that they
should not change the term of the existing Directors'
Service Agreements. 
Non-executive Directors' remuneration
The remuneration of the Chairman and Non-executive
Directors is determined by the Board on the
recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer on
an annual basis and takes into account market rates
based on independent advice, as required. The
Chairman and Non-executive Director's concerned
do not participate in this process. 
Tony Caplin, Timothy Holland-Bosworth and Kenneth
McGeorge have fixed three year appointments until
19 January 2008. The appointments may be
terminated by either party giving three month's
notice at any time without compensation. 
As Chairman, Kenneth McGeorge is entitled to
receive a fee of  30,000 per annum with no pension,
bonus, benefits or share options.
The Non-executive Directors, other than the Chairman,
receive a basic fee which was adjusted to  20,000
each per annum from the 19 January 2005. The
Non-executive Directors do not participate in any
incentive, pension or benefit scheme.
