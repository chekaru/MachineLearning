s co Pe o F the re Port
The  Remuneration  Report  summarises  the  Group's  remuneration  policy  and  particularly  its  application  in  connection  with  the  Directors.  The  report  also  describes  how  the  Group  applies  the  principles  of  good  corporate  governance  in  relation  to  Directors'  remuneration.
The  Directors'  Remuneration  Report  Regulations  2002  (the  Regulations )  require  the  Auditors  to  report  to  shareholders  on  the  information  contained  in  the  Directors'  Remuneration ,  Directors'  Share  Options ,  and  the  Directors'  Interest  in  Ordinary  Shares   sections  in  this  Report  (the  auditable  parts )  and  to  state  whether,  in  their  opinion,  these  parts  of  the  Report  have  been  properly  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Companies  Act  1985  (as  amended  by  the  Regulations).
t he r emuneration c ommittee
The  Remuneration  Committee  is  appointed  by  the  Board  and  comprises  only  Non-executive  Directors,  including  the  Non-executive  Chairman.  The  Committee  meets  regularly  to  determine,  on  behalf    of  the  Board,  the  framework  of  executive  remuneration.
During  the  year,  the  membership  of  the  Committee  comprised:  Kenneth  McGeorge  (Chairman),  Tony  Caplin  and  Timothy  Holland-
Bosworth.  The  members  of  the  Committee  are  considered  by  the
Board  to  be  independent  Non-executive  Directors.
During  the  current  year,  the  Committee  met  on  three  occasions,  with  the  attendance  of  all  members.
The  Committee's  terms  of  reference  are  reviewed  regularly  and  approved  by  the  Board.  These  are  available  for  inspection  at  the  Group's  registered  address.  The  members  of  this  Committee  do  not  have  any  personal  financial  interests  (other  than  as  disclosed  on  page  44  or  any  conflicts  from  cross-directorships  that  relate  to  the  business  of  the  Committee.    The  members  do  not  have  any  day-to-day  involvement  in  the  running    of  the  Group.  Kenneth  McGeorge  is  the  sole  member  not  regarded  as  being  independent,  as  defined  by  the  Combined  Code  on  Corporate  Governance,  for  the  reason  that  he  is  the  Group's  Non-executive  Chairman.  However,  he  is  considered  to  be  independent  by  the  Board.
To  assist  the  work  of  the  Committee,  the  views  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Chief  Financial  Officer  and  Head  of  Human  Resources  are    also  invited  where  appropriate.  These  individuals  did  not  however  participate  in  any  decision  related  to  their  own  remuneration.
r emuneration Policy
The  Group  is  committed  to  the  governing  objective  of  maximising  shareholder  value  over  time.  Each  year  the  remuneration  framework  and  the  packages  of  the  Directors  are  reviewed  to  ensure  they  continue  to  achieve  this  objective.
The  Group's  policy  is  to  attract,  retain  and  incentivise  Executive  Directors  to  run  the  Group  and  meet  the  expectations  of  shareholders  whilst  adopting  a  prudent  approach  to  overall  remuneration.
Basic salary an D BeneFits
The  Group's  policy  for  Executive  Directors'  salaries  is  that  they  should
be  maintained  at  competitive  levels  for  those  in  comparable  positions,  with  variations  to  reflect  individual  performance,  experience  and  job  size.  Benefits  in  kind  consist  of  private  medical  and  health  insurance,  employer  pension  contributions  and  health  club  membership.
emPloyee BeneFit t rust ( eBt  )
An  EBT  was  established  during  the  year  ended  30  September  2005,  and  Jim  Sewell,  Edward  Spurrier  and  Ben  Marnham  were  each  awarded  interests  in  638,400,   0.00125p  shares  held  by  the  trust.
These  shares  are  held  on  trust  for  them  absolutely  subject  to  the  trustees  retaining  a  lien  on  the  shares.  The  lien  is  in  respect  of
the  trustees'  obligation  to  settle  the  loan  from  the  Company  used
to  acquire  the  shares  (which  is  the  equivalent  to   277,000  each,   831,000  being  the  total  loan)  plus  any  premium.  The  premium  arises
in  the  event  that  the  lien  is  settled  within  the  initial  two  year  period
and  is  equal  to  the  increase  in  the  value  of  the  shares  at  that  time.

time.  If  the  Group  terminates  the  contract  by  notice  but  other  than
on  giving  full  notice,  the  Service  Agreements  provide  for  the  payment  of  the  fixed  amount  equal  to  the  salary  and  other  contractual  benefits  for  the  unexpired  proportion  of  the  duration  of  the  appointment
