CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
remuneration report
Scope of the report
The Remuneration Report summarises the Group's remuneration policy and particularly its application in connection with the Directors. 
The report also describes how the Group applies the principles of good corporate governance in relation to Directors' remuneration. 
This report is not mandatory for companies listed on the AIM but has been voluntarily included as a matter of best practice.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is appointed by the Board and comprises only Non executive Directors, including the Non executive Chairman. 
The Committee meets regularly to determine, on behalf of the Board, the framework of executive remuneration.
During the year, the membership of the Committee comprised Timothy Holland Bosworth (Chairman), Tony Caplin and Ben Mingay (appointed 
19 January 2011). The members of the Committee are considered by the Board to be independent Non executive Directors.
during the current year, the Committee met on four occasions, with the attendance of all members.
The Committee's terms of reference are reviewed regularly and approved by the Board. These are available for inspection at the Group's registered 
address. The members of this Committee do not have any conflicts from cross directorships that relate to the business of the Committee. The 
members do not have any day-to-day involvement in the running of the Group. T ony Caplin is the sole member not regarded as being independent, 
as defined by the Combined Code on corporate governance, for the reason that he is the Group's Non executive Chairman. However, he is 
considered to be independent by the Board.
To assist the work of the Committee, the views of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Human Resources are also 
invited where appropriate. These individuals did not, however, participate in any decision related to their own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The Group is committed to the governing objective of maximising shareholder value over time. Each year the remuneration framework and the 
packages of the directors are reviewed to ensure they continue to achieve this objective.
The Group's policy is to attract, retain and incentivise Executive Directors to run the Group and meet the expectations of shareholders whilst 
adopting a prudent approach to overall remuneration.
Basic salary and benefits
The Group's policy for executive Directors' salaries is that they should be maintained at competitive levels for those in comparable positions, 
with variations to reflect individual performance, experience and job size. Benefits in kind consist of car allowances, private medical and health 
insurance, employer pension contributions and health club membership.
Employee Benefit Trust (EBT)
An EBT was established during the year ended 30 September 2005 and Jim Sewell, Edward Spurrier and Ben Marnham were each awarded 
interests in 638,400 0.125p shares held by the trust.
These shares are held on trust for them absolutely subject to the trustees retaining a lien on the shares. The lien is in respect of the trustees' 
obligation to settle the loan from the Company used to acquire the shares (which is equivalent to  277,000 each,  831,000 being the total loan).
In March 2010 the EBT subscribed to 2,000,000 shares at the nominal price of 0.125p per share. The trust has waived its rights to dividends on 
these shares. James Murray, Jim Sewell, Edward Spurrier and Ben Marnham each have an interest in these shares which could be used to settle 
future entitlements to shares under the Group's incentive plans.
2010 Value Creation Plan (VCP) (Note 29)
A VCP was established on 24 February 2010. Under the scheme James Murray, Jim Sewell, Edward Spurrier and Ben Marnham were each 
awarded potential share options which are subject to meeting specific performance criteria. The first measurement date under the scheme 
was 31 December 2010 and the number of options to be granted based on performance to that date is 2,179,570. This number has been 
approved by the Remuneration Committee but no formal grant of options took place during the year so the total number of options 
outstanding at 30 September 2011 is nil (2010: nil).
All employee share and share option plans (Note 29)
The Group's EMI scheme was adopted on the 22 December 2004. Under the Group's EMI Scheme, options which are qualifying options under 
the Enterprise Management Incentive regime and also unapproved options may be granted. As at the 30 September 2011 there were no options 
outstanding for 2004 scheme (2010: nil).
A second EMI scheme was established on 18 January 2006 (EMI 2006). As at 30 September 2011, options were outstanding over 55,796 
ordinary shares (2010: 99,183) under this scheme. annual report and accounts 2011

is still an employee of the Group and the Group had achieved certain performance criteria in the period 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2008. 
The exercise price is  1.025 per share which was the market value at the date of the grant. During the year ended 30 September 2011, there 
were 43,387 options exercised (2010: 56,106) and no options lapsed (2010: 10,016).
Options under the EMI 2007 scheme can be exercised from 31 December 2009 based on the conditions that the option holder is still

The exercise price is  1.505 per share which was the market value at the date of the grant. During the year ended 30 September 2011, 
there were 501,724 options exercised (2010: 71,182) and 8,567 options lapsed (2010: 68,485).
Options under the EMI 2008 scheme can be exercised from 3 July 2011 based on the conditions that the option holder is still an employee of 
Alternative Networks plc and the Group has achieved certain performance criteria in the period 3 July 2008 to 2 July 2011. The exercise price 
is  1.355 per share which was the market value at the date of the grant. During the year ended 30 September 2011, there were 110,700 options 
exercised (2010: nil) and no options lapsed (2010: nil).
Service Agreements
Each of the Executive Directors has a Service Agreement with the Group. These are rolling agreements which can be terminated by either party 
giving not less than six months notice in writing at any time. If the Group terminates the contract by notice but other than on giving full notice, the 
Service Agreements provide for the payment of the fixed amount equal to the salary and other contractual benefits for the unexpired proportion 
of the duration of the appointment or entitlement to notice, as the case may be. It is the Committee's view that they should not change the term 
of the existing Directors' Service Agreements.
Non-executive Directors' remuneration
The remuneration of the Chairman and Non executive Directors is determined by the Board on the recommendation of the Chief Executive 
Officer on an annual basis and takes into account market rates based on independent advice, as required. The Chairman and Non executive 
directors concerned do not participate in this process.
Ben Mingay, Tony Caplin and Timothy Holland Bosworth have fixed one year appointments until 19 January 2012. The appointments may 
be terminated by either party giving three months' notice at any time without compensation.
As Chairman, Tony Caplin is entitled to receive a fee of  35,000 per annum with no pension, bonus, benefits or share options.
Ben Mingay and Timothy Holland Bosworth receive basic fees of  33,000 per annum and  23,795 per annum respectively.
The Non executive Directors do not participate in any incentive, pension or benefit scheme.
