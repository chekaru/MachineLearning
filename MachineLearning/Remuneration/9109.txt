REMUNERATION REPORT
Scope of the report
The Remuneration report summarises the Group's remuneration policy and particularly its application in connection with the Directors. The 
report also describes how the Group applies the principles of good corporate governance in relation to Directors' remuneration. This report is 
not mandatory for companies listed on the AIM but has been voluntarily included as a matter of best practice.
 
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is appointed by the Board and comprises only Non-executive Directors, including the Non-executive Chairman. 
The Committee meets regularly to determine, on behalf of the Board, the framework of executive remuneration.
During the year, the membership of the Committee comprised: Ben Mingay (Chairman) and Timothy Holland-Bosworth. The members of the 
Committee are considered by the Board to be independent Non-executive Directors.
 
During the current year, the Committee met on two occasions, with the attendance of all members.
 
The Committee's terms of reference are reviewed regularly and approved by the Board. These are available for inspection at the Group's 
registered address. The members of this Committee do not have any conflicts from cross-directorships that relate to the business of the 
Committee. The members do not have any day to day involvement in the running of the Group. Timothy Holland-Bosworth is the sole member 
not regarded as being independent, as defined by the Combined Code on corporate governance, for the reason that he is the Group's Non-
executive Chairman. However, he is considered to be independent by the Board.
T o assist the work of the Committee, the views of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Human Resources are also 
invited where appropriate. These individuals did not however participate in any decision related to their own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The Group is committed to the governing objective of maximising shareholder value over time. Each year the remuneration framework and the 
packages of the Directors are reviewed to ensure they continue to achieve this objective.
The Group's policy is to attract, retain and incentivise executive Directors to run the Group and meet the expectations of shareholders whilst 
adopting a prudent approach to overall remuneration.
Basic salary and benefits
The Group's policy for Executive Directors' salaries is that they should be maintained at competitive levels for those in comparable positions, 
with variations to reflect individual performance, experience and job size. Benefits in kind consist of car allowances, private medical and health 
insurance, employer pension contributions and health club membership.
Employee Benefit Trust ( EBT')
An EBT was established during the year ended 30 September 2005, and Jim Sewell, Edward Spurrier and Ben Marnham were each awarded 
interests in 638,400, 0.125p shares held by the trust.
These shares are held on trust for them absolutely subject to the trustees retaining a lien on the shares. The lien is in respect of the trustees' 
obligation to settle the loan from the Company used to acquire the shares (which is equivalent to  277,000 each,  831,000 being the total loan).
In March 2010 the EBT subscribed to 2,000,000 shares at the nominal price of 0.125p per share. The trust has waived its rights to dividends 
on these shares. James Murray, Jim Sewell, Edward Spurrier and Ben Marnham each have an interest in these shares which could be used to 
settle future entitlements to shares under the Group's incentive plans.
2010 Value Creation Plan ( VCP') (note 29)
A VCP was established on 24 February 2010. Under the scheme James Murray, Jim Sewell, Edward Spurrier and Ben Marnham were each 
awarded potential share options which are subject to meeting specific performance criteria. The first measurement date under the scheme was 
31 December 2010 and the number of options to be granted based on performance to that date was 2,179,570. The second measurement date 
under the scheme was 31 December 2011 and the number of options to be granted based on performance to that date was 1,880,916. These 
numbers were approved by the remuneration committee and award certificates were issued for all 4,060,486 options on 8 March 2012. The total 
number of options outstanding at 30 September 2012 is 4,060,486 (2011: nil).

Service Agreements
Each of the Executive Directors has a Service Agreement with the Group. These are rolling agreements which can be terminated by either party 
giving not less than 6 months notice in writing at any time. If the Group terminates the contract by notice but other than on giving full notice, the 
Service Agreements provide for the payment of the fixed amount equal to the salary and other contractual benefits for the unexpired proportion 
of the duration of the appointment or entitlement to notice, as the case may be. It is the Committee's view that they should not change the term 
of the existing Directors' Service Agreements.
Non-executive Directors' remuneration
The remuneration of the Chairman and Non-executive Directors is determined by the Board on the recommendation of the Chief Executive 
Officer on an annual basis and takes into account market rates based on independent advice, as required. The Chairman and Non-executive 
Directors concerned do not participate in this process.
Ben Mingay and Timothy Holland-Bosworth have fixed one year appointments until 19 January 2013. The appointments may be terminated by 
either party giving three months' notice at any time without compensation.
As Chairman, Timothy Holland-Bosworth is entitled to receive a fee of  24,400 per annum with no pension, bonus, benefits or share options.
Ben Mingay receives a fee of  33,825 per annum with no pension, bonus, benefits or share options.
The Non-executive Directors do not participate in any incentive, pension or benefit scheme.
