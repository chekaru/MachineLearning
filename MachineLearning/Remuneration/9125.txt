 Annual Report and Accounts 2013
REVIEW OF THE YEAR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
33
Scope of the report
The Remuneration report summarises the Group's remuneration policy and particularly its application in connection with the Directors. The
report also describes how the Group applies the principles of good corporate governance in relation to Directors' remuneration. This report
is not mandatory for companies listed on the AIM but has been voluntarily included as a matter of best practice.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is appointed by the Board and comprises only Non-executive Directors. The Committee meets regularly to
determine, on behalf of the Board, the framework of executive remuneration.
During the year, the membership of the Committee comprised: Mark Quartermaine (Chairman), Ben Mingay, Bernard Cragg and Timothy
Holland-Bosworth. The members of the Committee are considered by the Board to be independent Non-executive Directors. 
During the current year, the Committee met on six occasions. 
The Committee's terms of reference are reviewed regularly and approved by the Board. These are available for inspection at the Group's
registered address. The members of this Committee do not have any conflicts from cross-directorships that relate to the business of the
Committee. The members do not have any day to day involvement in the running of the Group. 
To assist the work of the Committee, the views of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Human Resources Director are also
invited where appropriate. These individuals did not however participate in any decision related to their own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The Group is committed to the governing objective of maximising shareholder value over time. Each year the remuneration framework and
the packages of the Directors are reviewed to ensure they continue to achieve this objective.
The Group's policy is to attract, retain and incentivise Executive Directors to run the Group and meet the expectations of shareholders whilst
adopting a prudent approach to overall remuneration.
Basic salary and benefits
The Group's policy for Executive Directors' salaries is that they should be maintained at competitive levels for those in comparable positions,
with variations to reflect individual performance, experience and job size. Benefits in kind consist of car allowances, private medical and
health insurance, employer pension contributions and health club membership.
Employee Benefit Trust ( EBT')
An EBT was established during the year ended 30 September 2005, and Jim Sewell, Edward Spurrier and Ben Marnham were each
awarded interests in 638,400, 0.125p ordinary shares in the Company held by the trust.
These shares are held on trust for them absolutely subject to the trustees retaining a lien on the shares. The lien is in respect of the trustees'
obligation to settle the loan from the Company used to acquire the shares (which is equivalent to  277,000 each,  831,000 being the total
loan). During the year Ben Marnham and Jim Sewell settled the loans due to the Company in respect of their shares. The total loan
remaining at 30 September 2013 is  277,000. 
In March 2010 the EBT subscribed to 2,000,000 shares in the Company at the nominal price of 0.125p per share as part of a joint
ownership plan (JOP). The EBT waived its rights to dividends on these shares. James Murray, Jim Sewell, and Edward Spurrier each have
an interest in these shares which was applied to deliver value in respect of part of the VCP in January 2013, as detailed below in 2010 Value
Creation Plan. Dividends are now payable on these shares. 
During the year Ben Marnham swapped his entire interest in 500,000 jointly owned shares for full ownership of 242,710 shares. This leaves
1,500,000 JOP shares at 30 September 2013.
2010 Value Creation Plan ( VCP') (note 28)
The VCP was established on 24 February 2010. Under the scheme James Murray, Jim Sewell, Edward Spurrier and Ben Marnham were
each made awards which were subject to meeting specific performance criteria. The value of a total of 4,060,486 shares was due under this
scheme when it concluded on 31 December 2012. The value of 954,704 of these awards was delivered through the value held by the
individuals in the above jointly owned shares leaving 3,105,782 B awards delivered as nil cost options. All 3,105,782 options have been
exercised during the year leaving no outstanding VCP options at 30 September 2013 (2012: 4,060,486).
2013 Long Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP')
An LTIP was established during the year and 222,623 options were granted on 8 February 2013. A further 82,539 options were granted on
18 June 2013. These options will be eligible for exercise three years from the date of grant based on the conditions that the option holder is
still an employee of the Group and the Group has achieved certain performance criteria to the period ending 30 September 2015. The
exercise price is  nil per share.

Service agreements
Each of the Executive Directors has a Service Agreement with the Group. These are rolling agreements which can be terminated by either
party giving at least six months' notice in writing at any time. If the Group terminates the contract by notice, other than full notice, the Service
Agreements provide for the payment of the fixed amount equal to the salary and other contractual benefits for the unexpired proportion of
the duration of the appointment or entitlement to notice, as the case may be. It is the Committee's view that they should not change the
term of the existing Directors' Service Agreements.
Non-executive Directors' remuneration
The remuneration of the Chairman and Non-executive Directors is determined by the Board on the recommendation of the Chief Executive
Officer on an annual basis and takes into account market rates based on independent advice, as required. The Chairman and Non-
executive Directors concerned do not participate in this process.
Mark Quartermaine and Ben Mingay have fixed one year appointments until 10 December 2013 and 19 January 2014 respectively. It is the
intention of the Board that they will both be reappointed. Bernard Cragg has a fixed three year appointment until 10 December 2015. The
appointments may be terminated by either party giving three months' notice at any time without compensation.
Mark Quartermaine receives a fee of  30,000 per annum with no pension, bonus, benefits or share options.
Ben Mingay receives a fee of  34,675 per annum with no pension, bonus, benefits or share options.
Bernard Cragg receives a fee of  50,000 per annum with no pension, bonus, benefits or share options.
