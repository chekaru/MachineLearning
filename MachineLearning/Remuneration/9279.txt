 The Remuneration Committee comprises three of the Group's non-executive directors. The Committee is responsible for determining
the emoluments of executive directors, with the objective of attracting, motivating and retaining high quality individuals who will
contribute fully to the success of each of the Group's businesses.
Remuneration policy 
Salaries are reviewed annually on the basis of market comparisons with positions of similar responsibility and scope in companies of a
similar size in comparable industries. The Committee takes into account both company pay awards and personal performance in reviewing
directors' salaries.
Executive directors participate in a discretionary bonus scheme linked to the Group's earnings and are eligible to participate in the Group's
Executive Share Options and Long Term Incentive Scheme.
The Company's policy is to consider mitigation on termination of service contracts.
Non-executive directors' remuneration
Fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Board on the basis of market comparisons with positions of similar
responsibility and scope in companies of a similar size in comparable industries.
Non-executive directors do not have contracts of service, are not eligible for pension scheme membership and do not participate
in any of the Group's bonus, share option or incentive schemes, except for Michael Reid who became a non-executive director on
30 June 1999 and has outstanding options granted whilst he was an executive director, details of which can be found on page 16.

Benefits include the provision of a company car, relocation allowance (for Paul Hooper) and health insurance.
All executive directors except Paul Hooper are members of one of the Group's defined benefit pension schemes, which provide
a final salary plan with individual accrual rates ranging from 1/35th to 1/60th for each year of service, with a maximum pension
of two-thirds of final salary. The Company paid contributions into an executive pension scheme which has a money purchase
arrangement for Paul Hooper. Pensionable salary excludes bonus payments to the directors.

Service contracts
The Committee has determined to respect current best practice in respect of service contracts issued on all new appointments.
All executive directors are employed under 12 month rolling service contracts. In the case of directors appointed prior to 1994,
these are increased by one month for each completed year of service, to a maximum of 24 months. Accordingly Messrs McCall
and Bailie have contracts for 24 months and Mr Sowerby has a contract for 23 months. The Committee considers that such periods
are reasonable and necessary to retain high calibre executive directors.
Details of compliance with the Combined Code can be found in the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 17 to 18.
