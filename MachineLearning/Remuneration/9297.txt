Remuneration Report
Information not subject to audit
Remuneration policy 
Salaries are reviewed annually on the basis of market comparisons with positions of similar responsibility and scope in companies 
of a similar size in comparable industries. The Remuneration Committee takes into account company pay awards and personal
performance in reviewing directors' salaries and information from external salary survey sources, including Monks Partnership,
(part of PriceWaterhouseCoopers).
Annual bonuses are determined by a formula agreed with the Remuneration Committee. A zero threshold is set each year above
which bonuses increase in line with earnings, to a maximum of 40% of salaries, (in relation to Paul Hooper the maximum bonus is
50% of his salary). The bonus targets are set at levels which the Remuneration Committee believes to provide a major challenge
for management in the bonus year.
The Remuneration Committee annually reviews long term incentive awards and awards under the Group's executive share option
plan which are designed to reward the achievement of long term performance targets.
The Company's policy is to consider mitigation on termination of service contracts.
Non-executive directors' remuneration
Fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Board on the basis of market comparisons with positions of similar
responsibility and scope in companies of a similar size in comparable industries. They are not eligible for pension scheme
membership and do not participate in any of the Group's bonus, share option or incentive schemes.
All executive directors, except Paul Hooper, are members of The Alumasc Group Pension Scheme which is a final salary scheme
and provides directors with individual accrual rates ranging from 1/35th to 1/60th for each year of service, with a maximum
pension of two-thirds of final salary. Pensionable salary excludes bonus payments to the directors.
Service contracts
The Remuneration Committee has determined to respect current best practice in respect of service contracts issued on all new
appointments.
In the case of directors appointed prior to 1994, notice periods are increased by one month for each completed year of service, to
a maximum of 24 months. Accordingly Messrs McCall and Sowerby have rolling service contracts and notice periods of 24
months. Messrs Hooper and Rhodes are employed under 12 month rolling service contracts with 12 months notice.
None of the non-executive directors have service contracts. In accordance with current best practice, since 1999 letters of
appointment have been issued which provide for an initial period of three years, subject to review. Richard Saville's current terms
of appointment expire on 1 January 2005. There are no such letters of appointment in respect of Messrs Gwyn and Pither who
were appointed prior to this date.
The Committee considers the above arrangements are reasonable and necessary to the employment of high calibre executive
directors. Details of compliance with the Combined Code can be found in the corporate governance statement on pages 14 to 15.
The graph shows the total shareholder return on a hypothetical holding of shares in the Company compared with a broad equity
market. The directors have chosen to illustrate TSR against the FTSE All Share Index. This Index has been selected as, in the
opinion of the directors, providing a more sound comparison than any subset of the market.

year.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Alumasc Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan (the Plan ) was approved by the shareholders in October 1997. The purpose of
the Plan is to motivate key individuals to take the Company upon a programme of long term growth and to reward them for
exceptional performance. Under the Plan each participant is allocated a number of shares. The vesting of shares under the Plan is
subject to the achievement of the Performance Criteria. To date no shares have been vested in the participants.
Awards under the Plan vest pro rata between nil and 100 per cent conditional upon achieving targeted growth in EPS over a fixed
three year period following the making of the award.
In respect of awards made prior to October 2002 there is nil vesting until the Group reaches the lower target of 2.5 per cent
growth per annum in EPS above the rate of increase in the RPI. 100 per cent of awards will vest on achieving 15 per cent growth
per annum in EPS above the rate of increase in RPI.
In respect of awards made after October 2002 there will be 10 per cent vesting when the Group reaches the lower target of 2.5
per cent growth per annum in EPS above the rate of increase in the RPI. 100 per cent of awards will vest on achieving 10 per
cent growth per annum in EPS above the rate of increase in RPI.
The maximum contingent interest in shares under the Plan is:
