Remuneration Report
Information not subject to audit
The Remuneration Committee comprises non-executive directors only and is chaired by Philip Gwyn. The Committee advises the Board on the Group's
policy of executive remuneration.
Remuneration policy 
Salaries are reviewed annually on the basis of market comparisons with positions of similar responsibility and scope in companies of a similar size in
comparable industries. In reviewing directors' salaries the Remuneration Committee takes into account both company pay awards and personal
performance and information from an external salary survey source, Monks Partnership (part of PriceWaterhouseCoopers).
There are four main elements which make up the executive remuneration package, basic salary, bonuses, benefits and share incentive schemes. The
Company's policy is to consider mitigation on termination of service contracts; compensation on termination is not specifically contracted for in
directors' service agreements.
Annual bonuses are determined by a formula agreed with the Remuneration Committee. A zero threshold is set each year above which bonuses increase
in line with profits, to a maximum of 40% of salaries (in relation to Paul Hooper the maximum bonus is 50% of his salary). The bonus targets are set at
levels which the Remuneration Committee believes to provide a major challenge for management in the bonus year.
Long term incentive awards and awards under the Group's executive share option plan are designed to reward the achievement of long-term performance targets.
Fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Board on the basis of market comparisons with positions of similar responsibility and scope in
companies of a similar size in comparable industries. They are not eligible for pension scheme membership and do not participate in any of the Group's
bonus, share option or incentive schemes.
All executive directors, except Paul Hooper, are members of The Alumasc Group Pension Scheme which is a final salary scheme and provides directors
with an accrual rate of 1/60th for each year of service, with a maximum pension of two-thirds of final salary. Pensionable salary excludes bonus
payments to the directors. A company money purchase arrangement is in place for Paul Hooper.
Service contracts
The Remuneration Committee has determined to respect current best practice in respect of service contracts issued on all new appointments.
Messrs McCall, Hooper and Rhodes are employed under 12 month rolling service contracts with notice periods of 12 months. Under a transitional
arrangement, David Sowerby's service contract will reduce from its current 22 months to become 12 months by 30 June 2005.
None of the non-executive directors have service contracts. In accordance with current best practice, since 1999, letters of appointment have been issued
which provide for an initial period of three years, subject to review. There are no such letters of appointment in respect of Messrs Gywn and Pither, who
were appointed prior to this date.
The Committee considers the above arrangements are reasonable and necessary to the employment of high calibre directors.
Details of compliance with the Combined Code can be found in the corporate governance statement on pages 17 to 18.
The graph shows the total shareholder return on a hypothetical holding of shares in the Company compared with a broad equity market. The directors
have chosen to illustrate TSR against the FTSE All Share Index. 
This Index has been selected as, in the opinion of the directors, providing a more sound comparison than any subset of the market.

a. The total accrued pension at 30.6.2004 is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the financial year (except in
the case of Mr Bailie when the calculation is based on a termination date of 31 August 2003).
b. The values of accrued pension have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Guidance Note GN11 and are stated after
deducting director contributions. The values represent a liability of the employing company - not a sum to be paid or due to the individual director.
c. Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
d. Mr Bailie retired on 31 August 2003. The Company augmented his pension by a payment of  91,000 into the Scheme. This amount is included in the
accrued pension value.
e. The value of accrued pension at 30.06.2004 in respect of Mr Rhodes was reduced by  21,152 during the year as a result of a reallocation to a third
party. As a consequence of this, the total accrued pension as at 30.06.2004 has been reduced by the annual pension equivalent of  2,650.

Executive share options awarded between October 1994 and October 1999 may only be exercised if the growth in Earnings Per Share (EPS) exceeds UK
Retail Price Index (RPI) by 6% over the course of a continuous three year period. This relates only to the 10,629 options awarded to David Sowerby in
March 1995. For all other awards made since October 1999, EPS growth will have to exceed RPI plus 7.5%.
During the year no options held by current directors were granted, exercised or lapsed. Bill Bailie held 40,000 share options as at 1 July 2003 which
lapsed at the date of his retirement.
The closing mid market price of the shares on 30 June 2004 was 142.5p and ranged between 134.0p and 168.5p per share during the year.
The current executive share option scheme and savings related share option scheme were adopted in October 1994. The Schemes are valid for ten years
therefore the Company will propose at the Annual General Meeting in October 2004 that shareholders approve and adopt new share option schemes. 
A summary of the rules is detailed in the circular which accompanies the Report and Accounts.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Alumasc Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan (the Plan) was approved by the shareholders in October 1997. The purpose of the Plan is to motivate
key individuals to take the Company upon a programme of long term growth and to reward them for exceptional performance. Under the Plan each
participant is allocated a number of shares. The vesting of shares under the Plan is subject to the achievement of performance criteria. To date, no shares
have been vested in participants.
LTIP Awards vest pro rata between nil and 100% conditional upon achieving targeted growth in earnings per share ( EPS') over a fixed three year period
following the making of the award. 
In respect of awards made prior to October 2002 there is nil vesting until the Group reaches the lower target of 2.5% growth per annum in EPS above the
rate of increase in the RPI. 100% of awards will vest on achieving 15% growth per annum in EPS above the rate of increase in RPI.
In respect of awards made after October 2002 there will be 10% vesting when the Group reaches the lower target of 2.5% growth per annum in EPS
above the rate of increase in the RPI. 100% of awards will vest on achieving 10% growth per annum in EPS above the rate of increase in RPI.
There was one grant, during the year ended 30 June 2004, made in October 2003, when the share price was  1.64. The award totalled 143,728 shares,
included within this were awards made to executive directors as shown below.
The maximum contingent interest in shares under the Plan is:
