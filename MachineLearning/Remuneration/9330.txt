Remuneration Report
Information not subject to audit
The Remuneration Committee comprises non-executive directors only and is chaired by Jon Pither. The Committee advises the Board on
the Group's policy on executive remuneration.
Remuneration policy 
Salaries are reviewed annually on the basis of market comparisons with positions of similar responsibility and scope in companies of a
similar size in comparable industries. In reviewing directors' salaries the Remuneration Committee takes into account both company pay
awards, personal performance and information from external salary survey sources, Monks Partnership (part of PricewaterhouseCoopers).
There are four main elements which make up the executive remuneration package, basic salary, bonuses, benefits and share incentive
schemes. The Company's policy is to consider mitigation on termination of service contracts; compensation on termination is not
specifically contracted for in directors' service agreements.
Annual bonuses are determined by a formula agreed with the Remuneration Committee. A zero threshold is set each year above which
bonuses increase in line with profits, to a maximum of 40% of salaries (in relation to Paul Hooper the maximum bonus is 50% of his
salary). The bonus targets are set at levels which the Remuneration Committee believes provide a major challenge for management in the
bonus year.
Long term incentive awards and awards under the Group's executive share option plan are designed to reward the achievement of long-
term performance targets.
Fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Board on the basis of market comparisons with positions of similar responsibility
and scope in companies of a similar size in comparable industries. They are not eligible for pension scheme membership and do not
participate in any of the Group's bonus, share option or incentive schemes.
All executive directors, except Paul Hooper, are members of The Alumasc Group Pension Scheme which is a final salary scheme and
provides directors with an accrual rate of 1/60th for each year of service, with a maximum pension of two-thirds of final salary.
Pensionable salary excludes bonus payments to the directors. A Company money purchase arrangement has been set up for Paul Hooper.
Service contracts
The Remuneration Committee has determined to respect current best practice in respect of service contracts issued on all new
appointments.
All executive directors are employed under 12 month rolling service contracts, with notice periods of 12 months.
None of the non-executive directors have service contracts. In accordance with current best practice, since 1999, letters of appointment
have been issued which provide for an initial period of three years, subject to review. There are no such letters of appointment in respect
of Messrs Gwyn and Pither, who were appointed prior to this date.
The Committee considers the above arrangements are reasonable and necessary to the employment of high calibre directors.
Details of compliance with the Combined Code can be found in the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 21 to 23.
The graph shows the total shareholder return on a hypothetical holding of shares in the Company compared with a broad equity market.
The directors have chosen to illustrate TSR against the FTSE All Share Index.
This Index has been selected as, in the opinion of the directors, providing a more sound comparison than any subset of the market.

a. The total accrued pension at 30.6.2005 is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the financial
year.
b. The values of accrued pension have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Guidance Note GN11 and are
stated after deducting director contributions. The values represent a liability of the employing company - not a sum to be paid or due
to the individual director.
c. Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
d. The total change in the value of the accrued pension during the period is significantly impacted by the reduction of corporate bond
yields which increase the value of all defined benefit pension scheme liabilities.
The Company paid contributions into an executive pension scheme which has a money purchase arrangement for Paul Hooper.
Contributions paid during the year were  34,000 (2004:  33,000).

Long Term Incentive Plan
The Alumasc Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan (the Plan ) was approved by the shareholders in October 1997. The purpose of the Plan
is to motivate key individuals to take the Company upon a programme of long term growth and to reward them for exceptional
performance. Under the Plan each participant is allocated a number of shares. The vesting of shares under the Plan is subject to the
achievement of performance criteria.
LTIP awards vest pro rata between nil and 100% conditional upon achieving targeted growth in earnings per share (EPS) over a fixed 
3 year period following the making of the award.

in EPS above the rate of increase in the UK Retail Prices Index (RPI). 100% of awards will vest on achieving 15% growth per annum in EPS
above the rate of increase in RPI.
In respect of awards made after October 2002 there will be 10% vesting when the Group reaches the lower target of 2.5% growth per
annum in EPS above the rate of increase in the RPI. 100% of awards will vest on achieving 10% growth per annum in EPS above the rate
of increase in RPI.
