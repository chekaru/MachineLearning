Remuneration Report
Information not subject to audit
The Remuneration Committee comprises non-executive directors only and is chaired by Jon Pither. The Committee advises the Board on the
Company's policy on executive remuneration.
Remuneration policy 
The Company's policy is that the remuneration arrangements for 2006 and subsequent financial years should be sufficiently competitive to attract,
retain and motivate high quality executives capable of achieving the Group's objectives thereby enhancing shareholder value.
There are four main elements which make up the executive remuneration package: basic salary, bonuses, benefits and share incentive
schemes. The Company's policy is to consider mitigation on termination of service contracts; compensation on termination is not specifically
contracted for in directors' service agreements.
Annual bonuses are determined by a formula agreed with the Remuneration Committee. A zero threshold is set each year above which
bonuses increase in line with profits, to a maximum of 40% of salaries (in relation to Paul Hooper the maximum bonus is 50% of his salary).
The bonus targets are set at levels which the Remuneration Committee believes provide a major challenge for management in the bonus year.
Long term incentive awards and awards under the Group's executive share option plan are designed to reward the achievement of long-term
performance targets and to align the interests of management with those of the shareholders.
Salaries are reviewed annually on the basis of market comparisons with positions of similar responsibility and scope in companies of a similar
size in comparable industries. In reviewing directors' salaries the Remuneration Committee takes into account both company pay awards and
personal performance and information from external salary survey sources including Monks Partnership (part of PriceWaterhouseCoopers).
Fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Board on the basis of market comparisons with positions of similar responsibility and
scope in companies of a similar size in comparable industries. The non-executive directors are not eligible for pension scheme membership
and do not participate in any of the Group's bonus, share option or incentive schemes.
During the year David Sowerby, Martin Rhodes and, until 6 April 2006, John McCall were members of The Alumasc Group Pension Scheme which
is a final salary scheme and provides directors with an accrual rate of 1/60th for each year of service, with a maximum pension of two-thirds of
final salary. Pensionable salary excludes bonus payments to the directors. Paul Hooper participates in a Company money purchase arrangement.
Service contracts
The Remuneration Committee has determined to respect current best practice in respect of service contracts issued on all new appointments.
Executive directors are employed under 12 month rolling service contracts, with notice periods of 12 months.
None of the non-executive directors have service contracts except for John McCall who had his service contract substantially revised to
reflect the changes put in place from 6 April 2006. The terms of the revised contract will be reviewed after three years. 
In accordance with current best practice, since 1999, letters of appointment have been issued which provide for an initial period of three years,
subject to review. There are no such letters of appointment in respect of Messrs Gwyn and Pither, who were appointed prior to this date.
The Committee considers the above arrangements reasonable and necessary to the employment of high calibre directors.
Details of compliance with the Combined Code can be found in the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 21 to 23.
The graph shows the total shareholder return on a hypothetical holding of shares in the Company compared with a broad equity market.
The directors have chosen to illustrate TSR against the FTSE All Share Index. This Index has been selected as, in the opinion of the directors,
providing a more sound comparison than any subset of the market.

a. The accrued pension at 30 June 2006 is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on the service to the end of the
financial year.
b. The values of accrued pension have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Guidance Note GN11 and are
stated after deducting director contributions. The values represent a liability of the employing company - not a sum to be paid or due
to the individual director.
c. Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
d. The change in the value of the accrued pension during the period includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors
beyond the control of the Company. It is calculated after deducting each director's contribution.
e. The figures for Mr McCall are based on pensionable service to 5 April 2006, when he ceased to accrue pension benefits. As part of the
crystallisation of his benefits, a reassessment was made of the retained benefits from former employments, forming an offset to the
Scheme pension. The offset was higher than previously assumed and hence the apparent reduction in the value of the pension benefits.
The Company paid contributions into an executive pension scheme which has a money purchase arrangement for Paul Hooper.
Contributions paid during the year were  36,000 (2005:  34,000).

Long Term Incentive Plan
The Alumasc Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan (the Plan ) was approved by the shareholders in October 1997. The purpose of the Plan is
to motivate key individuals to take the Company upon a programme of long term growth and to reward them for exceptional performance.
Under the Plan each participant is allocated a number of shares. The vesting of shares under the Plan is subject to the achievement of
performance criteria.
LTIP awards vest pro rata between nil and 100% conditional upon achieving targeted growth in earnings per share (EPS) over a fixed three
year period following the making of the award.
There will be 10% vesting when the Group reaches the lower target of 2.5% growth per annum in EPS above the rate of increase in the
RPI. 100% of awards will vest on achieving 10% growth per annum in EPS above the rate of increase in RPI.
In between the higher and the lower target the awards vest on a straight line basis.
There was one grant, during the year ended 30 June 2006, made in October 2005, when the share price was  1.55. The award totalled
127,390 shares, included within this were awards made to executive directors as shown below.
