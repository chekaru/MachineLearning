The Remuneration Committee comprises non-executive directors only and is chaired by Jon Pither. The Committee advises the Board on the
company's policy on executive remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The company's policy is that current and future remuneration arrangements should be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate
high quality executives capable of achieving the group's objectives thereby enhancing shareholder value.
There are four main elements which make up the executive remuneration package, basic salary, bonuses, benefits and share incentive
schemes. The company's policy is to consider mitigation on termination of service contracts; compensation on termination is not specifically
contracted for in directors' service agreements.
Annual bonuses are determined by a formula agreed with the Remuneration Committee. A zero threshold is set each year above which
bonuses increase in line with profits, to a maximum of 40% of salaries (in relation to Paul Hooper the maximum bonus is 50% of his salary).
The bonus targets are set at levels which the Remuneration Committee believes provide a major challenge for management in the bonus year.
Long term incentive awards and awards under the group's executive share option plan are designed to reward the achievement of long-term
performance targets and to align the interests of management with those of the shareholders.
Salaries are reviewed annually on the basis of market comparisons with positions of similar responsibility and scope in companies of a similar
size in comparable industries. In reviewing directors' salaries the Remuneration Committee takes into account both company pay awards and
personal performance and information from external salary survey sources including Monks Partnership (part of PriceWaterhouseCoopers).
Fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Board on the basis of market comparisons with positions of similar responsibility and
scope in companies of a similar size in comparable industries. They are not eligible for pension scheme membership and do not participate in
any of the group's bonus, share option or incentive schemes.
During the year Martin Rhodes and, until the end of October 2006, David Sowerby were members of The Alumasc Group Pension Scheme
which is a final salary scheme and provides directors with an accrual rate of 1/60th for each year of service, with a maximum pension of
two-thirds of final salary. Pensionable salary excludes bonus payments to the directors. Paul Hooper and Andrew Magson participate in
money purchase arrangements.
Service contracts
The Remuneration Committee has determined to respect current best practice in respect of service contracts issued on all new appointments.
Executive directors are employed under 12 month rolling service contracts, with notice periods of 12 months.
None of the non-executive directors have service contracts except for John McCall who had his service contract substantially revised to
reflect the changes put in place from 5 April 2006 when he assumed a part-time role. The terms of the revised contract will be reviewed
after three years.
In accordance with current best practice, since 1999, letters of appointment for non-executive directors have been issued which provide for
an initial period of three years, subject to review. There are no such letters of appointment in respect of Messrs Gwyn and Pither, who were
appointed prior to this date.
The Committee considers the above arrangements are reasonable and necessary to the employment of high calibre directors.
Details of compliance with the Combined Code can be found in the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 27 to 29.

a. Pension accruals shown for Mr Rhodes are the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement based on service at the end of
the year.
b. The figures for Mr Sowerby are based on service to 26 October 2006, when he ceased to accrue pension benefits and took early
retirement. The pension shown at 30 June 2007 is his current pension in payment at that date.
c. Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with Guidance Note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession. No allowance has
been made for the scaling back which would apply in practice.
d. The value of net increase (4) represents the incremental value to the Director of his service during the year, calculated on the
assumption that service terminated at the year-end for Mr Rhodes and 26 October 2006 for Mr Sowerby. It is based on the accrued
pension increase (2) after deducting each Director's contribution.
e. The change in the transfer value (7) includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the
company and Directors, in particular stock market movements. It is calculated after deducting each director's contribution.
f. Any voluntary contributions paid by directors and the resulting benefits are not shown.
g. Mr J S McCall, who was included in last year's disclosure, has been excluded this year as he did not accrue any benefits in the year to
30 June 2007.
The company paid contributions into executive pension schemes which are money purchase arrangements for Paul Hooper and Andrew
Magson. Contributions paid during the year were  40,000 (2006:  36,000) and  15,000 (2006: nil) respectively. 32 The Alumasc Group plc Report and Accounts 2007

Long Term Incentive Plan
The Alumasc Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan (the Plan ) was approved by the shareholders in October 1997. The purpose of the Plan is
to motivate key individuals to take the company upon a programme of long term growth and to reward them for exceptional performance.
Under the Plan each participant is allocated a number of shares. The vesting of shares under the Plan is subject to the achievement of
performance criteria.
LTIP awards vest pro rata between nil and 100% conditional upon achieving targeted growth in earnings per share ( EPS') over a fixed 3 year
period following the making of the award.
There will be 10% vesting when the group reaches the lower target of 2.5% growth per annum in EPS above the rate of increase in the RPI.
100% of awards will vest on achieving 10% growth per annum in EPS above the rate of increase in RPI.
In between the higher and the lower target the awards vest on a straight line basis.
There was one grant, during the year ended 30 June 2007, made in October 2006, when the share price was  1.81. The award totalled
148,675 shares, included within this were awards made to executive directors as shown below.
The Board is currently considering a new or alternative incentive arrangement in light of the expiry of the current scheme this year.
