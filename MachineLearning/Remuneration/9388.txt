 Introduction
The Remuneration Committee has adopted the principles of good governance relating to Directors' remuneration as set out in the 2006 Combined
Code on Corporate Governance. This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
It is a requirement that the company's auditors report to shareholders on certain parts of this Report and state whether in their opinion those parts of
it have been properly prepared. Accordingly, the Report has been divided into separate sections consisting of unaudited and audited information.
As required by the Companies Act, a resolution to approve this Report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the company on
23 October 2008.
This Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee on behalf of the Board.

The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises non-executive directors only and is chaired by Jon Pither. The Committee advises the Board on the
company's policy on executive remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The company's policy is that current and future remuneration arrangements should be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate high
quality executives capable of achieving the group's objectives thereby enhancing shareholder value.
There are four main elements which make up the executive remuneration package: basic salary, bonuses, benefits and share incentive schemes.
The company's policy is to consider mitigation on termination of service contracts; compensation on termination is not specifically contracted for in
directors' service agreements.
Annual bonuses are determined by a formula agreed with the Remuneration Committee. A zero bonus threshold is set each year above which
bonuses increase in line with profits, to a maximum of 50% in relation to Paul Hooper and 45% in relation to Andrew Magson. The bonus targets
are set at levels which the Remuneration Committee believes provide a major challenge for management in the bonus year.
Long term incentive awards and awards under the group's executive share option plan are designed to reward the achievement of long-term
performance targets and to align the interests of management with those of the shareholders.
Salaries are reviewed annually on the basis of market comparisons with positions of similar responsibility and scope in companies of a similar size in
comparable industries. In reviewing directors' salaries the Remuneration Committee takes into account both company pay awards and personal
performance and information from external salary survey sources including Monks Partnership (part of PriceWaterhouseCoopers).
Fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Board on the basis of market comparisons with positions of similar responsibility and scope in
companies of a similar size in comparable industries. They are not eligible for pension scheme membership and do not participate in any of the
group's bonus, share option or incentive schemes.
During the year Martin Rhodes was a member of The Alumasc Group Pension Scheme which is a final salary scheme and provides directors with an
accrual rate of 1/60th for each year of service, with a maximum pension of two-thirds of final salary. Pensionable salary excludes bonus payments to
the directors. Paul Hooper and Andrew Magson participate in money purchase arrangements.
Service contracts
The Remuneration Committee has determined to respect current best practice in respect of service contracts issued on all new appointments.
Executive directors are employed under 12 month rolling service contracts, with notice periods of 12 months.
None of the non-executive directors have service contracts except for John McCall who had his service contract substantially revised to reflect the
changes put in place from 5 April 2006 when he assumed a part-time role. The terms of the revised contract will be reviewed after three years.
In accordance with current best practice, since 1999, letters of appointment for non-executive directors have been issued which provide for an initial
period of three years, subject to review. There are no such letters of appointment in respect of Philip Gwyn and Jon Pither, who were appointed prior
to this date. Richard Saville's letter of appointment was renewed for a further one-year period during the year.
The Committee considers the above arrangements are reasonable and necessary to the employment of high calibre directors.
Details of compliance with the Combined Code can be found in the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 32 to 35.

c. The value of net increase (4) represents the incremental value to the Director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption that
service terminated at 10 June 2008 for Mr Rhodes and also allowing for an additional year of service which Mr Rhodes received as part of the
terms of his contract. It is based on the accrued pension increase (2) after deducting his own contributions over the period.
d. The change in the transfer value (7) includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the company
and directors, in particular stock market movements. It is calculated after deducting Mr Rhodes' own contributions.
e. Any voluntary contributions paid by Mr Rhodes and the resulting benefits are not shown.
The company paid contributions into executive pension schemes which are money purchase arrangements for Paul Hooper and Andrew Magson.
Contributions paid during the year were  41,000 (2007:  40,000) and  20,400 (2007:  15,000) respectively.

above test is met in the three years following the award.

Long Term Incentive Plan
The Alumasc Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan (the Plan ) was approved by the shareholders in October 1997. The purpose of the Plan is to
motivate key individuals to take the company upon a programme of long term growth and to reward them for exceptional performance. Under the
Plan each participant is allocated a number of shares. The vesting of shares under the Plan is subject to the achievement of performance criteria.
Plan awards vest pro rata between nil and 100% conditional upon achieving targeted growth in earnings per share ( EPS') over a fixed 3 year period
following the making of the award.
There will be 10% vesting when the group reaches the lower target of 2.5% growth per annum in EPS above the rate of increase in the RPI. 100%
of awards will vest on achieving 10% growth per annum in EPS above the rate of increase in RPI. In between the higher and the lower target the
awards vest on a straight line basis.
There was one grant, during the year ended 30 June 2008, made in October 2007, when the share price was 208p. The award totalled 134,347
shares, included within this were awards made to executive directors as shown below.

Proposed New Long Term Incentive Plan
The current Long Term Incentive Share Plan was adopted in October 1997. Plans of this type are valid for ten years therefore the company will
propose at the Annual General Meeting in October 2008 that shareholders approve and adopt a new Long Term Incentive Share Plan. A summary
of the rules is detailed in the Circular which accompanies the Report and Accounts.
At the financial year end the employee trust held 68,526 ordinary shares. The market value of the shares held in trust at 30 June 2008 was  121,000.
