Introduction
The Remuneration Committee has adopted the principles of good governance relating to Directors' remuneration as set out in the 2008 Combined
Code on Corporate Governance. This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008.
It is a requirement that the Company's auditors report to shareholders on certain parts of this Report and state whether in their opinion those parts
of it have been properly prepared. Accordingly, the Report has been divided into separate sections consisting of unaudited and audited information.
As required by the Companies Act 2006, a resolution to approve this Report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company on
29 October 2009.
This Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee on behalf of the Board.
Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is entirely non-executive and its membership is set out on page 30. The Committee's principal functions are to
advise the Board on the Company's policy on executive remuneration and to approve the specific remuneration of executive directors, including
their service contracts. Its remit therefore includes, but is not limited to, basic salary, benefits in kind, performance-related bonus awards, share
options and awards, long-term incentive plans, pension rights and any other compensation or termination payments. The detailed terms of
reference for the Committee are displayed on the Company's web-site www.alumasc.co.uk.
Advisors to the Committee
In exercising its responsibilities during the year, advice has been provided to the Committee by Howes Percival LLP in relation to Long Term
Incentive Plans.
Remuneration policy
The Company's policy is that current and future remuneration arrangements should be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate high
quality executives capable of achieving the group's objectives thereby enhancing shareholder value. The Committee considers the arrangements
described below are reasonable and necessary to achieve this purpose. In determining the remuneration of directors for the year, the Committee
took careful account of the pay and conditions of the employees throughout the group.
The Committee has decided that, in view of current economic conditions, the basic salary entitlement of Executive Directors for the year
commencing 1 July 2009 will be frozen at 30 June 2009 levels and that no bonuses shall be payable to Executive Directors for the year ended
30 June 2009. The Committee retains discretion to review these decisions should circumstances dictate.
There are four main elements which make up the executive remuneration package, basic salary, bonuses, benefits and share-based incentive schemes.
Salaries
Salaries are reviewed annually on the basis of market comparisons with positions of similar responsibility and scope in companies of a similar size in
comparable industries. In reviewing directors' salaries the Remuneration Committee takes into account both company pay awards and personal
performance and information from external salary survey sources including Monks Partnership (part of PriceWaterhouseCoopers).
Fees for Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board on the basis of market comparisons with positions of similar responsibility and scope
in companies of a similar size in comparable industries. They are not eligible for pension scheme membership and do not participate in any of the
group's bonus, share option or incentive schemes.
Bonuses
Annual bonuses are determined as a percentage of basic salary by a formula agreed with the Remuneration Committee. A zero threshold is set
each year above which bonuses increase in line with profits and cash generation, to a maximum of 50% in relation to Paul Hooper and 45% in
relation to Andrew Magson. The bonus targets are set at levels which the Remuneration Committee believes provide a major challenge for
management in the bonus year.
Benefits
During the year, Paul Hooper and Andrew Magson participated in defined contribution pension arrangements. Additional benefits available to
directors include health insurance and a car allowance.
Share-based Incentive Schemes
Long term incentive awards and awards under the group's executive share option plan are designed to reward the achievement of long-term
performance targets and to align the interests of management with those of the shareholders. 34 The Alumasc Group plc
Report and Accounts 2009
1 - Executive Share Option Plan
Executives have, in the past, been able to participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme approved by shareholders in 2004. This scheme was
designed to encourage the matching of interests between management and shareholders, and has now been largely superseded by the Long Term
Incentive Plans outlined below. However, Paul Hooper continues to participate by virtue of an award made in 2006, which may be exercised until
2016 on condition that the growth in Earnings per Share (EPS) exceeds the increase in the Retail Price Index (RPI) by 7.5% over the course of a
continuous three year period.
2 - Long Term Incentive Plans
The group operates two Long Term Incentive Plans (the Plans ) which were approved by shareholders in October 1997 and at the last AGM held
in October 2008 respectively. The purpose of the Plans is to motivate key individuals to take the company upon a programme of long term growth
and to reward them for exceptional performance. Under the Plans each participant is allocated a number of shares. The vesting of shares under the
Plans is subject to the achievement of performance criteria, which are described for each plan below.
The 1997 Plan
The 1997 Plan has expired and thus no new awards were made during the year. However, awards remain outstanding from previous years and the
interests of Directors in such awards are set out in the table in the section of this Report that is subject to audit.
Awards vest pro rata between nil and 100%, conditional upon achieving targeted growth in earnings per share ( EPS') over a fixed 3 year period
following the making of the award.
There will be 10% vesting when the group reaches the lower target of 2.5% growth per annum in EPS above the rate of increase in RPI. 100% of
awards will vest on achieving 10% growth per annum in EPS above the rate of increase in RPI.
In between the higher and the lower target the awards vest on a straight line basis.
The 2008 Plan
Details of the awards made to individual directors are set out in the table in the section of this Report that is subject to audit.
Each award is dependent partially on an EPS performance condition and partially on total shareholder return (TSR) meaning a measure of the
growth in value of the ordinary shares of the Company over the performance period, assuming that all dividends are reinvested to purchase
additional shares. The relative weighting to be attributed to EPS and TSR in a particular award is decided upon by the Remuneration Committee.
No part of any award will vest unless the average annual growth of EPS equals or exceeds RPI plus 2.5% measured over a fixed 3 year period
following the making of the award.
On the attainment of this 2.5% average annual growth threshold, 25% of the whole award will vest.
The whole of the remaining part of an award dependent on EPS will vest if the average annual growth in EPS equals or exceeds RPI plus 10%.
The vesting of the remainder of any part of an award dependent on TSR will depend on the percentage movement of the Company's share price at least
equalling the median performance of the FTSE All Share Index, up to 100% vesting if the percentage movement is equivalent to upper quartile performance.
In between the higher and the lower targets for both EPS and TSR, the awards vest on a straight line basis.
Service contracts
The Remuneration Committee has determined to respect current best practice in respect of service contracts issued on all new appointments.
Executive directors are employed under rolling service contracts, with notice periods of 12 months in either direction. Paul Hooper's contract is
dated 28 January 2001 and Andrew Magson's contract is dated 7 August 2006.
None of the Non-Executive Directors have service contracts except for John McCall who has a service contract dated 9 May 1986. Mr McCall's
contract, which was substantially amended in 2006 on his move to a part-time role, was renewed during the year for a further three year term
expiring on 30 April 2012. It is subject to a notice period of 12 months in either direction.
There are no specific contractual provisions dealing with compensation payable to directors for early termination of service contracts. Under the
service contracts, the company has the right to terminate employment on paying basic salary in lieu of the contractual notice period. In the event
of such early termination, the Remuneration Committee would give careful consideration to the amount to be paid, taking into account the
circumstances of the particular case and the responsibility and ability of the individual to mitigate.
In accordance with current best practice, since 1999 all new Non-Executive Directors have been appointed on the basis of letters of appointment
providing for an initial period of three years, subject to review. There are no such letters of appointment in respect of Messrs Gwyn and Pither, who
were appointed prior to 1999. Mr Saville's letter of appointment was renewed for a further one-year period during the year.
