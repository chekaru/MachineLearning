Remuneration Report
The Alumasc Group plc
Report and Accounts 2011
Introduction
The Remuneration Committee has adopted the principles of good governance relating to Directors' remuneration as set out in The UK Corporate 
Governance Code June 2010. This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and 
Medium-sized companies and groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008.
It is a requirement that the company's auditors report to shareholders on certain parts of this Report and state whether in their opinion those parts 
of it have been properly prepared. Accordingly, the Report has been divided into separate sections consisting of unaudited and audited information.
As required by the Companies Act, a resolution to approve this Report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the company on 
27 October 2011.
This Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee on behalf of the Board.
Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is entirely non-executive and its membership is set out on page 25. The Committee's principal functions are to advise 
the Board on the company's policy on executive remuneration and to approve the specific remuneration of Executive Directors, including their 
service contracts. Its remit therefore includes, but is not limited to, basic salary, benefits in kind, performance-related bonus awards, share options 
and awards, long-term incentive plans, pension rights and any other compensation or termination payments. The detailed terms of reference for 
the Committee are displayed on the company's web-site www.alumasc.co.uk.
Remuneration policy 
The company's policy is that current and future remuneration arrangements should be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate high 
quality executives capable of achieving the group's objectives thereby enhancing shareholder value. The Committee considers the arrangements 
described below are reasonable and necessary to achieve this purpose. In determining the remuneration of Directors for the year, the Committee 
took careful account of the pay and conditions of the employees throughout the group.
The bonuses payable to Executive Directors for the year ended 30 June 2011 were designed to reward action taken to grow the business in line 
with the group's strategic plan whilst managing cash efficiently. In addition, an element of the bonus related to the achievement of personal 
objectives connected to the group's strategic development. The Committee retains discretion to review these criteria should circumstances dictate.
There are four main elements which make up the executive remuneration package: basic salary, bonuses, benefits and share-based incentive 
schemes.
Salaries
Salaries are reviewed annually on the basis of market comparisons with positions of similar responsibility and scope in companies of a similar size 
in comparable industries. In reviewing Directors' salaries the Remuneration Committee takes into account both company pay awards and personal 
performance and information from external salary survey sources.
The base salaries of the Executive Directors were reviewed with effect from 1 July 2011 and the increases awarded are as follows: 
    Annual Salary % Increase
G P Hooper    242,000 3.0
A Magson    152,000 4.8
Fees for Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board on the basis of market comparisons with positions of similar responsibility and scope 
in companies of a similar size in comparable industries. They are not eligible for pension scheme membership and do not participate in any of the 
group's bonus, share option or incentive schemes. The fees payable remained unchanged throughout the year.
Bonuses
Annual bonuses are determined as a percentage of basic salary by a formula agreed with the Remuneration Committee. A zero threshold is set 
each year above which bonuses increase in line with profits, cash generation and the achievement of certain objectives, to a maximum in the 
2010/11 financial year of 60% in relation to Paul Hooper and 55% in relation to Andrew Magson. The bonus targets are set at levels which the 
Remuneration Committee believes provide a major challenge for management in the bonus year.
Benefits
During the year, Paul Hooper and Andrew Magson participated in defined contribution pension arrangements. Additional benefits available to 
Directors include health insurance and a car and fuel allowance.

Share-based Incentive Schemes
Long term incentive awards and awards under the group's executive share option plan are designed to reward the achievement of long-term 
performance targets and to align the interests of management with those of the shareholders. 
1 - Executive Share Option Scheme
Executives have, in the past, been able to participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme approved by shareholders in 2004. This scheme is 
designed to encourage the matching of interests between management and shareholders. No awards under the scheme were made to Executive 
Directors during the year. Paul Hooper continues to participate by virtue of an award made in 2006, which may be exercised until 2016 on 
condition that the growth in Earnings per Share (EPS) exceeds the increase in the Retail Price Index (RPI) by 7.5% over the course of a continuous 
three year period. 
2 - Long Term Incentive Plans
The group operates two Long Term Incentive Plans (the Plans ) which were approved by shareholders in October 1997 and in October 2008 
respectively. The purpose of the Plans is to motivate key individuals to take the company upon a programme of long term growth and to reward 
them for exceptional performance. Under the Plans each participant is allocated a number of shares. The vesting of shares under the Plans is 
subject to the achievement of performance criteria, which are described for each plan below.
The 2008 Plan
Details of the awards made to individual Directors are set out in the table in the section of this Report that is subject to audit.
Each award is dependent partially on an EPS performance condition and partially on total shareholder return (TSR ) meaning a measure of 
the growth in value of the ordinary shares of the company over the performance period, assuming that all dividends are reinvested to purchase 
additional shares. The relative weighting to be attributed to EPS and TSR in a particular award is decided upon by the Remuneration Committee.
 
No part of any award will vest unless the average annual growth of EPS equals or exceeds RPI plus 2.5% measured over a fixed 3 year period 
following the making of the award.
On the attainment of this 2.5% average annual growth threshold, 25% of the whole award will vest. 
The whole of the remaining part of an award dependent on EPS will vest if the average annual growth in EPS equals or exceeds RPI plus 10%. 
The vesting of the remainder of any part of an award dependent on TSR will depend on the percentage movement of the company's share price 
at least equalling the median performance of the FTSE All Share Index, up to 100% vesting if the percentage movement is equivalent to upper 
quartile performance. 
In between the higher and the lower targets for both EPS and TSR, the awards vest on a straight line basis.
The 1997 Plan
The 1997 Plan has expired and thus no new awards were made during the year. The interests of Directors in such awards are set out in the table in 
the section of this Report that is subject to audit.
Awards vested pro rata between nil and 100%, conditional upon achieving targeted growth in earnings per share (EPS ) over a fixed 3 year 
period following the making of the award.
The performance conditions stated that there would be 10% vesting when the group reaches the lower target of 2.5% growth per annum in  
EPS above the rate of increase in RPI. 100% of awards would have vested on achieving 10% growth per annum in EPS above the rate of increase 
in RPI.
In between the higher and the lower target the awards vested on a straight line basis.
Service contracts
The Remuneration Committee has determined to respect current best practice in respect of service contracts issued on all new appointments.
Executive Directors are employed under rolling service contracts, with notice periods of 12 months in either direction. Paul Hooper's contract is 
dated 28 January 2001 and Andrew Magson's contract is dated 7 August 2006. 
None of the Non-Executive Directors have service contracts except for John McCall. Mr McCall's contract, which was substantially amended in 2006 
on his move to a part-time role, was renewed in 2009 for a further three year term expiring on 30 April 2012. It is subject to a notice period of 12 
months in either direction.
There are no specific contractual provisions dealing with compensation payable to Directors for early termination of service contracts. Under the 
service contracts, the company has the right to terminate employment on paying basic salary in lieu of the contractual notice period. In the event 
of such early termination, the Remuneration Committee would give careful consideration to the amount to be paid, taking into account the 
circumstances of the particular case and the responsibility and ability of the individual to mitigate.
Remuneration Report 37 The Alumasc Group plc
Report and Accounts 2011
In accordance with current best practice, since 1999 all new Non-Executive Directors have been appointed on the basis of letters of appointment 
providing for an initial period of three years, subject to review. There are no such letters of appointment in respect of Messrs Gwyn and Pither, who 
were appointed prior to this date. Mr Saville's letter of appointment was renewed for a further one-year period during the year. 
The graph shows the total shareholder return on a hypothetical holding of shares in the company compared with a broad equity market. 
The Directors have chosen to illustrate TSR against the FTSE All Share Index and the All Share Construction & Materials index. These indexes have 
been selected as, in the opinion of the Directors, they provide a more sound comparison than any subset of the market.
