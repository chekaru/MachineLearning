Remuneration Report
Introduction
The	Remuneration	 Committee	has	adopted	 the	principles	of	good	gover nance 	r elating 	to	Dir ectors' 	r emuneration 	as	set	out	in	The	UK 	 Corporate 	
Gover nance 	Code 	June	 2010.	This 	r eport 	has	 been	pr epar ed 	in	accor dance 	with	the	Companies	 Act	2006	and	Schedule	8 	of 	 the 	Large	and 	 
Medium-sized 	 companies	and 	gr oups 	(Accounts	and	Reports)	Regulations 	 2008.
It is a requirement that the company's auditors report to shareholders on certain parts of this Report and state whether in their opinion those parts  
of it have been properly prepared. Accordingly, the Report has been divided into separate sections consisting of unaudited and audited information.
As	r equir ed 	 by	 the	Companies	 Act,	a	r esolution 	to	 appr ove 	this	Report	will	be	pr oposed 	at	the	Annual	General 	Meeting	of	the 	company	on	 
25	 October 	2012.
This	Report	 has	been	 pr epar ed 	by	the	 Remuneration 	Committee	on	 behalf	of	the 	 Boar d.
Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee
The	Remuneration	 Committee	is	 entir ely 	non-executive	and 	its	membership	is	set	out	on 	page	32.	The	Committee' s 	principal	 functions	 ar e 	to	 
advise the Board on the company's policy on executive remuneration and to approve the specific remuneration of Executive Directors, including their  
service	contracts. 	Its	 r emit 	ther efor e 	includes, 	but	is	 not	limited	to,	basic	 salary , 	benefits	in	kind,	performance-r elated 	bonus	awar ds, 	shar e 	 options	
and	awar ds, 	 long-term	incentive	plans,	 pension 	 rights	and 	any	other	compensation	or	termination 	payments.	The	detailed	terms	of	r efer ence 	 for	 
the	Committee	ar e 	 displayed	on	 the	company' s 	web-site	 www .alumasc.co.uk.
Remuneration policy
The company's policy is that current and future remuneration arrangements should be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate high 
quality	executives 	 capable	of	achieving	the	gr oup' s 	objectives	ther eby 	enhancing 	 shar eholder 	value.	The	Committee	considers	the	arrangements	
described 	 below 	 ar e 	 r easonable 	 and	necessary	to	achieve	this	purpose.	In	determining	 the 	r emuneration 	of	Dir ectors 	for	the	year , 	 the 	Committee	
took careful account of the pay and conditions of the employees throughout the group. 
Executive Directors bonuses are designed to reward action taken to grow the business in line with the group's strategic plan whilst managing cash 
efficiently. In addition an element of the bonus related to the achievement of personal objectives connected to the group's strategic development. 
Bonus	arrangements	ar e 	discr etionary 	 and	the 	Committee	 r etains 	discr etion 	to	r eview 	these	 criteria 	 should 	cir cumstances 	dictate.
Ther e 	ar e 	 four	main	 elements	which	make 	up	the	 executive	r emuneration 	package,	basic	salary , 	bonuses,	benefits 	 and	shar e-based 	incentive	
schemes.
Salaries
Salaries	 ar e 	 r eviewed 	annually	on	 the	basis	of	market	comparisons	with	positions	of	similar	r esponsibility 	and 	scope 	in	 companies 	of	a	similar	 size	
in	comparable	industries.	In	r eviewing 	Dir ectors' 	salaries	 the	Remuneration	Committee	takes	into	account	both	company	pay	awar ds 	and	personal	
performance and information from external salary survey sources.
The base salaries of the Executive Directors were reviewed with effect from 1 July 2012 and no increases were awarded. 
Fees 	for	 Non-Executive	Dir ectors 	ar e 	determined 	by	the 	Boar d 	on	the	basis	of	market	comparisons 	with 	positions	of 	 similar 	r esponsibility 	 and	 scope 	
in companies of a similar size in comparable industries. They are not eligible for pension scheme membership and do not participate in any of the 
group's bonus, share option or incentive schemes. The fees payable remained unchanged throughout the year.
Bonuses
Annual	bonuses	ar e 	 determined	as 	 a 	 per centage 	 of	basic	 salary 	 by 	a	formula 	agr eed 	with	the	Remuneration	Committee.	A	 zer o 	thr eshold 	is 	set	 
each year above which bonuses increase in line with profits, cash generation and the achievement of certain personal objectives, to a maximum  
in	the 	 2011/12	financial 	 year	of 	50%	in	r elation 	to	Paul	Hooper	and	45%	in	r elation 	to	Andr ew 	Magson. 	The	bonus	targets	ar e 	 set	at	levels	 which	
the	Remuneration 	 Committee	 believes 	pr ovide 	 a 	major	 challenge	for 	management	in	the	bonus	year . 	
No bonuses were payable to Executive Directors for the year ended 30 June 2012.
Benefits
During the year, Paul Hooper and Andrew Magson participated in defined contribution pension arrangements. Additional benefits available  
to Directors include health insurance and a car allowance. The Alumasc Group plc

Share-based Incentive Schemes
Long	term	 incentive 	 awar ds 	and 	 awar ds 	under	the	 gr oup' s 	executive	shar e 	option	plan	ar e 	designed	 to 	r ewar d 	the	achievement	of	long-term	
performance targets and to align the interests of management with those of the shareholders. 
1 - Executive Share Option Scheme
Executives	 have,	 in 	 the	past,	been	able	to	participate	 in	the	Executive	Shar e 	Option 	Scheme	appr oved 	by 	 shar eholders 	in	2004. 	This 	scheme	is	
designed to encourage the matching of interests between management and shareholders. No awards under the scheme were made to Executive 
Directors during the year. Paul Hooper continues to participate by virtue of an award made in 2006, which may be exercised until 2016 on condition 
that	the	gr owth 	 in 	 Ear nings 	 per	Shar e 	(EPS) 	exceeds	the	incr ease 	in	the	Retail	Price	Index	(RPI)	 by 	7.5%	 over 	 the 	course	 of 	a	continuous	thr ee 	year 	
period. 
2 - Long Term Incentive Plan
The	gr oup 	operates 	the	 Long	T erm 	Incentive	Plan	(the 	Plan )	which	was	appr oved 	 by 	shar eholders 	in	 October	2008.	The	purpose	of	the	Plan	 is	to	
motivate key individuals to take the company upon a programme of long term growth and to reward them for exceptional performance. Under the 
Plan each participant is allocated a number of shares. The vesting of shares under the Plan is subject to the achievement of performance criteria, 
which are described below.
The 2008 Plan
Details of the awards made to individual Directors are set out in the table in the section of this Report that is subject to audit.
Each	awar d 	 is 	 dependent 	 partially 	 on	an	EPS	performance 	condition	and	 partially	on	 total 	shar eholder 	 r etur n 	 (TSR )	meaning 	a 	 measur e 	of 	 the	
gr owth 	 in 	value 	of	 the	 or dinary 	shar es 	of 	 the	Company 	 over	the	performance	period,	assuming	 that	all	dividends	 ar e 	r einvested 	to	pur chase 	
additional	 shar es. 	The	 r elative 	weighting	to	be	 attributed	to	 EPS 	 and	TSR	in	a	particular 	awar d 	is	decided	upon	by	the 	 Remuneration 	Committee.
No	part	of 	 any 	 awar d 	 will	vest	unless	the	average	annual	gr owth 	of 	 EPS	equals	or	exceeds	RPI	plus	2.5%	 measur ed 	over	a	fixed	3	year 	period	
following the making of the award.
On	the 	attainment	of	 this 	 2.5%	average	annual	 gr owth 	thr eshold, 	25%	of	the	whole	awar d 	will	vest.	
The	whole	 of	the	 r emaining 	part	of	an	awar d 	 dependent	on	EPS	will	vest 	if 	the 	average 	annual	gr owth 	in	EPS	equals	or	exceeds	RPI	plus	10%.	
The	vesting	of	 the	r emainder 	of 	any	part	 of	an	 awar d 	 dependent	on 	TSR 	 will	depend 	on 	the 	 per centage 	movement	 of 	the	Company' s 	 shar e 	price	at 	
least	equalling	the	 median	 performance 	of	 the	FTSE 	 All	Shar e 	Index,	up	 to 	100% 	vesting	if	the	per centage 	movement 	is	equivalent	to	upper	quartile	
performance. 
In	between	 the	higher	 and	the	lower	targets	for	both	EPS	and 	 TSR,	the 	 awar ds 	vest	on 	a 	 straight	line 	basis.
The	performance 	 conditions 	set 	 out	for 	 the	L TIP 	awar d 	granted 	 in	November	2011	wer e 	alter ed 	so	 that	of 	 the 	EPS 	element,	25%	would 	vest	 on 	 the	
Gr oup 	achieving	an 	underlying	pr ofit 	befor e 	tax 	of 	  7	million	in	2013/14.	If	the	underlying	pr ofit 	in	2013/14	was	 9	million 	or	above	the	full	 awar d 	
would vest with a pro rata vesting in between.
Service contracts
The	Remuneration	 Committee	has	determined 	to 	 r espect 	curr ent 	best	practice	in	r espect 	of	service 	contracts	issued	on	 all	new	appointments.
Executive Directors are employed under rolling service contracts, with notice periods of 12 months in either direction. Paul Hooper's contract is dated 
28	January	 2001 	 and	Andr ew 	 Magson' s 	contract	 is	dated	 7	August	2006.	
None	of	the	 Non-Executive	Dir ectors 	have 	service	contracts	 except	for	John 	McCall	who 	has	a	service	contract	dated	9	May	1986.	Mr 	McCall' s 	
contract,	which	was	substantially 	amended	in	2006	on	his	move 	 to	a	part-time	r ole, 	 was 	r enewed 	in	2012	for 	a 	 further	two	year 	term 	expiring	 on 	 
30	April	2014.	It	is	subject 	to 	a 	 notice 	 period	of	12	months	in	either	dir ection. 	
There are no specific contractual provisions dealing with compensation payable to directors for early termination of service contracts. Under the 
service contracts, the company has the right to terminate employment on paying basic salary in lieu of the contractual notice period. In the event 
of	such 	early	termination, 	the	Remuneration 	Committee	would	give	car eful 	consideration 	to	the	amount	to	be	paid,	taking 	into	account 	 the	
circumstances of the particular case and the responsibility and ability of the individual to mitigate.

In	accor dance 	 with	 curr ent 	 best	practice,	since	1999	all 	new	Non-Executive	Dir ectors 	have	been	appointed	on 	the	basis 	of	letters	of	appointment	
providing for an initial period of three years, subject to review. There are no such letters of appointment in respect of Messrs Gwyn and Pither,  
who	wer e 	 appointed	prior 	to	 this 	 date. 	 Mr 	 Saville' s 	letter	of	 appointment	was	r enewed 	for	a	further 	one-year	period	during	the	year . 	
Historical Total Shareholder Return Performance 
The graph shows the total shareholder return on a hypothetical holding of shares in the company compared with a broad equity market.  
The	Dir ectors 	have	chosen	 to 	illustrate	TSR	against 	the	FTSE	All 	Shar e 	Index	and	 the 	All 	Shar e 	Construction	&	Materials	index.	These	indexes	 
have been selected as, in the opinion of the Directors, they provide a more sound comparison than any subset of the market.
