 Directors' Remuneration Report
This report, which is prepared by the Remuneration Committee ( the Committee') and approved by the Board for the financial year ended 30 June 
2013, sets out the remuneration policy for the Directors of the Company. In response to the UK Government's proposed new legislation regarding 
the reporting of directors' remuneration, the Committee has agreed to adopt a number of the changes early.
The Remuneration Committee's overall approach remains unchanged. We are focused on ensuring the group's remuneration policy is aligned with 
shareholders' interests while also enabling us to attract, retain and motivate high quality executive management.
In making remuneration decisions, the Committee considers the group's overall performance against its long-term goals. For the year to 30 June 
2013, the group has delivered a positive set of results as described in both the Chairman's statement and Business Review. Particular highlights 
include:
  Revenue growth of 5.6% to  116.8 million
  Underlying profit before tax up by over 100% to  5.1 million
  Net debt reduced to  7.7 million
During the year the Committee reviewed executive remuneration packages and concluded that these are in line with market norms in terms of  
both structure and level, whilst also meeting the preference for simplicity outlined in recent institutional guidance. As a result, for the year ahead,  
the remuneration policy remains largely unchanged but will be kept under review. The detail of the Directors' remuneration is contained in the  
report that follows, but in summary:
Base Salary
For the financial year to 30 June 2013 Executive Directors salaries were not increased. 
Annual Bonus
Performance against the underlying profit before tax target for the annual bonus was assessed carefully by the Remuneration Committee and  
annual bonuses of 32.1% of base salary have been proposed for the year ended 30 June 2013, to be paid in cash. For the year to 30 June 2014,  
the maximum opportunity of the annual bonus will remain at 50% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 45% of base salary for the Finance 
Director and the Remuneration Committee has determined that financial performance against budget continues to provide the best measure of 
short term performance.
Long Term Incentive
The Remuneration Committee considers that the current long-term incentive based on achieving TSR and profit growth targets over a three-year 
performance period continues to provide an effective alignment between the Directors and the long-term interests of all of our shareholders.  
Awards to the Chief Executive and Finance Director of 75% and 50% of base salary, respectively, were made in the year.
The remuneration committee has followed the widespread debate on executive reward and welcomes the proposals for transparent remuneration 
reporting to ensure clear and concise information for shareholders. During the current year it will continue preparations to implement the 
forthcoming regulations on Directors' remuneration reporting for the year to 30 June 2014.
Risk
The Committee is satisfied that the current arrangements do not inadvertently encourage undue risk-taking, given the clear long-term focus  
in our policy.

This part of the Directors' Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy for the group.
Policy overview
In setting the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors, the Committee takes into account the following:
  The need to attract retain and motivate Executive Directors and senior management;
  Internal pay and benefits practice and employment conditions within the group as a whole; and 
  Periodic external comparisons to examine current market trends and practices and equivalent roles in similar companies.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors:
  Base salary
  Annual bonus
  Long-term incentives
  Pension provision
  Benefits
The key principles of the policy are:
  Base salaries set at around median level, but with the potential to earn upper-quartile rewards for sustained exceptional performance.
  A reward structure that balances short-term and long-term performance
Competitive incentive arrangements are underpinned by a balance of financial performance measures linked to corporate and individual 
performance, ensuring a focus on profitable growth and alignment with the interests of shareholders.
As a result, the Committee has determined that the remuneration of Executive Directors will provide an appropriate balance between fixed and 
performance-related elements. The Committee will continue to review the remuneration policy to ensure it takes due account of best remuneration 
practice and that it remains aligned with the interests of shareholders.

40 How the pay of group employees is taken into account
Pay and conditions elsewhere in the group were considered when assessing the remuneration for Executive Directors and continues to be reviewed 
in relation to the implementation of this policy. In order to do so, the committee assesses the wider pay and employment conditions in other parts  
of the group.
How the Executive Directors' remuneration policy relates to the wider group 
The remuneration policy as set out provides an overview of the structure that operates for the most senior executives in the group. Employees below 
executive level have lower proportions of their total remuneration subject to incentive based rewards. Long term incentives are reserved for those 
judged as having the greatest potential to influence the group's earnings growth and share price performance.
How shareholders' views are taken into account 
The committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year. This, plus other feedback received during the year, is then 
considered as part of the group's annual review of remuneration policy. At the 2012 AGM over 99% of those voting chose to vote in favour of the 
Directors' Remuneration Report and the Committee is grateful to receive this level of support.
Detailed remuneration policy 
Base salary
Base salary for each Executive Director is reviewed annually by the Committee, taking account of the Director's performance, experience and 
responsibilities. The Committee has regard to salary levels paid by UK listed companies of a similar size and nature. This approach ensures that the 
appropriate benchmark data is used. When determining Executive Directors, base salaries, the Committee also considers wider economic factors,  
the performance of the group as a whole and the general level of salary increases across the group. 
Benefits in kind and pension
The group operates a policy whereby Executive Directors are given a cash alternative to a company car, health insurance, disability insurance and life 
cover. Pension provision is provided by company and executive contributions into a defined contribution scheme. The group has two closed defined 
benefit schemes and there are no plans to reintroduce such schemes.
Bonus arrangements 
The Committee's general policy is that Executive Directors should receive a bonus in relation to the achievement of stretching performance targets 
which reflect how well the group has performed against budget. The committee wishes to retain the flexibility to set bonus targets which reward 
outperformance against predetermined performance objectives and which reflect the needs of the business.
Long-term incentive Plan 
The group operates the Long Term Incentive Plan (the Plan ) which was approved by shareholders in October 2008. The purpose of the Plan is to 
motivate key individuals to take the company upon a programme of long term growth and to reward them for exceptional performance. Under the 
Plan each participant is allocated a number of shares. The vesting of shares under the Plan is subject to the achievement of performance criteria, 
which are described below.
Each award is dependent partially on an EPS performance condition and partially on total shareholder return (TSR ) meaning a measure of  
the growth in value of the ordinary shares of the Company over the performance period, assuming that all dividends are reinvested to purchase 
additional shares. The relative weighting to be attributed to EPS and TSR in a particular award is decided upon by the Remuneration Committee.

The Committee's policy on service contracts for Executive directors is that they should provide for termination of employment by either side giving  
12 months' notice. The group's policy going forward will be that no Executive Director should be entitled to a notice period or payments in excess  
of their contractual arrangements.
No Executive Director has the benefit of provisions in their service contract for the payment of pre-determined compensation in the event of 
termination of employment.

Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is set by the Executive Directors. The policy of the Board is that the remuneration of the  
Non-Executive Directors should be consistent with the levels or remuneration paid by companies of a similar size and complexity. Non-Executive 
Directors receive an annual fee and are reimbursed expenses incurred in performing their duties. They do not receive any performance related 
remuneration or pension contributions. Current fee levels are as follows:

executives' choosing.
Bonus
The maximum bonus opportunity was set at 50% for Mr Hooper and 45% for Mr Magson. The maximum bonus achievable would only be paid on 
exceeding stretching targets relative to budgeted results for the year. Following assessment of the financial targets set at the start of the financial 
year total bonus payments of  70,000 were made to the Chief Executive and  48,852 to the Finance Director.
Long term Incentive Plan 
Under the Long Term Incentive Plan which was approved by shareholders in October 2008 the Chief Executive and Finance Director were granted 
LTIP's. At the date of the remuneration committee meeting in August 2012 the granting of LTIP's was discussed and provisional awards were  
assessed which were finally made in March 2013, this was done to align the Executive Directors interests more closely with those of the shareholders. 
The Chief Executive was given an LTIP award over 174,519 shares and the Finance Director was given an LTIP award over 73,076 shares which 
equated to 75% and 50% of salary respectively. 
The performance measures set out comprises 50% TSR and 50% Group earnings per share. 
Following the performance review of the LTIP's awarded in November 2010, no shares will vest under this grant.

Executives have in the past, been able to participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme approved by shareholders in 2004. This scheme is 
designed to encourage the matching of interests between management and shareholders. No awards under the scheme were made to Executive 
Directors during the year. The Chief Executive continues to participate by virtue of an award made in 2006, which may be exercised until 2016 on 
condition that the growth in Earnings per Share (EPS) exceeds the increase in the Retail Price Index (RPI) by 7.5% over the course of a continuous 
three year period.
