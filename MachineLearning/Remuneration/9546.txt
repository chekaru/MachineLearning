Information not subject to audit
The Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee during the
financial year ended 31 December 2003 were Mr T J N Beyer,
Mr D J Wright and Sir Robert Hayman-Joyce, all of whom are
independent Non-executive Directors. Mr Wright joined the
committee in December 2003 and the remaining members
served on the committee throughout the year. The Committee's
role is to set the terms of employment and emoluments of the
Executive Directors, to approve all grants of discretionary share
option awards and to advise the Board on and monitor
remuneration for senior management. The Committee received
relevant advice from Mr N M Prest (Chairman & Chief Executive)
and Mr P E Jarman (Company Secretary).
Remuneration policy
The remuneration policy of the Board is to attract, retain and
motivate Directors of the necessary calibre by rewarding them
with competitive salary and benefits packages and to design
these so as to align Directors' interests with those of the
shareholders wherever possible. These packages are linked to
individual and business performance and are reviewed each
year to ensure they are supportive to the business objectives of
the Group and the creation of shareholder value. Further details
on the main elements of the policy are set out below. Directors'
remuneration will be subject to regular review in accordance
with this policy in the next and following years. Nevertheless,
the Directors intend to continue to keep all elements of the
policy under review and will, where appropriate, make changes
to those elements in order to ensure that remuneration policy
has the optimum structure. 
Annual benefits
Annual benefits for Executive Directors comprise a basic salary,
appropriate to the demands of the job, health and car benefits,
and an annual discretionary incentive bonus. This is designed to
focus on the importance of meeting the Company's targets and
rewards achievement against established criteria, to encourage
performance in a manner that the Remuneration Committee
considers appropriate. The bonus is not pensionable. Non-
executive Directors receive a fixed annual fee only and do not
participate in any bonus scheme. Fees for Non-executive
Directors are determined by the Board as a whole within the
limits of the Articles of Association of the Company.
Longer term incentives
Executive Directors receive annual awards from the Company's
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) and may join the
Company's SAYE Share Option Scheme.
ESOS options are exercisable after a minimum of at least three
years and a specified maximum which will never be longer than
ten years after they are granted. In awarding options, and in
particular, in determining the number of shares over which an
option under any discretionary share option scheme is granted,
the Remuneration Committee will take into consideration the
position of the employee within the organisation and his or her
ability to influence the enhancement of shareholder value. This
policy also applies to awards to Executive Directors under the
scheme. Should the recommended offer referred to in the
Chairman's Statement be unsuccessful and Alvis remain an
independent company, ESOS options over shares with a market
value of an amount not exceeding 150% of basic salary will be
granted to the Executive Directors in 2004. Non-executive
Directors are not permitted to participate in any of the
Company's longer term incentive schemes.
In 1997, shareholders approved the rules of a Long Term
Incentive Plan (LTIP). However, on reviewing the relative merits
of this and other schemes, the Directors subsequently decided
it was not in the Company's best interests to implement the LTIP .
Although this decision is kept under review, the Directors do not
currently consider that the LTIP forms part of the Company's
remuneration policy. 
Share Option Performance Conditions
The ESOS rules provide that options may only be exercised if
there has been an increase in the Company's earnings per
share (EPS ) over an initial three year period which is not less
than the increase in the Retail Prices Index (RPI ) plus a
percentage determined by the Remuneration Committee at the
time of grant. For grants made in 2004, the required increase in
excess of RPI will be 9% in respect of awards up to 100% of
basic salary and 21% for awards in excess of this amount. If the
performance condition is not satisfied at this point, re-testing is
permitted on the first anniversary of the end of the initial three
year period, but with an appropriately adjusted EPS target. For
grants made in 2004, the re-test target will be 12% over RPI for
awards up to 100% of basic salary and 28% over RPI for awards
in excess of this amount. This performance condition was
chosen in order to ensure that options would only become
exercisable against the background of a sustained real increase
in the financial performance of the Company. The Remuneration Remuneration Report
60
Committee will determine whether the performance condition
has been met using the EPS information contained in the
Company's annual report and accounts, after taking the advice
of the auditors as to whether any adjustments are required to
ensure consistency in accordance with the terms of the
performance condition. This method of determining whether a
performance condition has been met was chosen because it is
objective and readily demonstrable.
Balance between performance-related and other 
remuneration elements
The Board considers that the performance-related elements of
the remuneration package, being bonus and share options,
provide potentially the largest benefits to the Executive Directors.
Service Contracts
The Company's policy on the duration of Directors' contracts is
that:
  Executive Directors should have rolling service contracts
terminable on no more than one year's notice served by the
Company or the Director;
  Non-executive Directors are appointed, where the Articles
of Association of the Company permit, for fixed terms of
usually 2 years, renewable on the agreement of both the
Company and the Director.
Mr Prest's service contract and up to September 2003 Mr.
Wright's letter of appointment have been exceptions to this
policy. Mr Prest's contract does not conform to this policy as
the policy was not implemented until 2001.
The Company does not normally make payments on termination
of a Director's contract beyond its contractual obligations.
Post retirement benefits
Executive Directors are offered membership of the Alvis
Pension Scheme, which is a defined benefit scheme. Non-
executive Directors do not participate in the pension scheme.
Performance graph
The graph below shows a comparison of the total shareholder
return for the Company's shares for each of the last 5 financial
years against the total shareholder return for the companies
comprised in the FTSE Defence and Aerospace Index. This
Index was chosen for this comparison as it is a broad equity
market index in which the Company is a constituent part and
comprises other companies which operate in a similar industrial
and commercial environment to Alvis.

Notes
(a) Subject to Inland Revenue limits, the scheme provides for a maximum pension of two thirds of basic salary at normal retirement
age together with dependents' pensions and a lump sum on death in service of four times basic salary. The pension in payment is
protected by the application of Limited Price Indexation (LPI) for service after April 1999. Executive Directors contribute 7% of
basic salary and the company makes up the balance of funding in respect of their pension provision. Directors may retire at any
time after age 50 with the approval of the Company and the application of full actuarial reduction to their pension entitlement.
(b) The accumulated total accrued pension at 31 December 2002, after application of the LPI for the period to 31 December 2003, is
 102,322 in respect of N M Prest and  9,336 in respect of M F Greenslade.
(c) The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement, based on service to the end of the year.
(d) The increase in accrued pension during the year, excluding any increase for inflation, is  9,207 in respect of N M Prest and  3,314
in respect of M F Greenslade.
(e) The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 less
Director's contributions.
(f) Members of the scheme have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions; neither the contributions nor the resulting
benefits are included in the above table.
(g) No element of remuneration other than basic salary is pensionable.
