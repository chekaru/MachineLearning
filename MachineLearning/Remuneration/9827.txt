 DIRECTORS' REMUNERA TION REPORT
This report covers the remuneration of executive and non-executive
directors and related matters, including grants of share options and
long-term incentive awards.
REMUNERA TION COMMITTEE REMIT
The committee recommends to the board the policy framework for the
annual remuneration, performance related payments and other aspects
of the terms and conditions of employment of the executive directors.
Within the agreed framework, the remuneration committee determines
the specific remuneration and, where relevant, termination payments for
each individual executive director .
In addition, the committee recommends all awards, determines
performance conditions and exercises all discretions under the
company's share based long-term incentive plans (Executive Share
Option Schemes 1995 and 2002, Long-T erm Incentive Plan and
Performance Share Plan 2002).
REMUNERA TION COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP AND ADVISERS
During the year, the members of the remuneration committee, any 
three of whom may form a quorum, comprised Mr J A Dallas
(chairman), Mr S Gillibrand, Mr J M Green-Armytage, Ms E P Airey and
Ms M O Hesse. Mr J-P Jacamon joined the committee following his
appointment to the board of directors on 27 November 2002.
In considering the matters within their remit, the committee takes 
account of recommendations from the chief executive and is advised 
by the corporate head of human resources. During 2002, the committee
appointed Watson Wyatt Partners to provide independent advice in 
relation to annual remuneration and long-term incentives and The Monks
Partnership and T owers Perrin in relation to annual remuneration. 
All three organisations also provided other remuneration and benefit
services to the company during the year . In addition, Bacon and Woodrow
provided technical advice related to the application of the performance
conditions under the Long-T erm Incentive Plan and Cameron McKenzie
provided advice in relation to executive directors' service contracts.
REMUNERA TION POLICY
The objective of the remuneration policy in respect of the executive
directors and other senior executives is to offer remuneration packages
which:
> allow AMEC to attract and retain senior executives of high calibre; and
> incentivise senior executives to achieve superior short-term
performance and increase the medium and long-term value of AMEC
for its shareholders.
This policy seeks to provide total remuneration packages that are
competitive in the markets in which executives are based, assist in
attracting and retaining high calibre executives and encourage executives
to build and retain a significant shareholding in AMEC.
Remuneration packages comprise:
>
base salaries which broadly equate to the mid-market salary practices
of a relevant group of engineering, construction and support services
comparator companies and other companies regarded as comparable
by virtue of, amongst other factors, their turnover, staff numbers,
capitalisation or geographic coverage;
> annual bonuses which incentivise the achievement of stretching
business and individual performance targets and offer the opportunity
to achieve upper quartile annual cash earnings if these targets are
achieved; and 
> medium and long-term incentives which align the interests of
shareholders and senior executives by offering the opportunity to
accumulate significant capital over a period if stretching shareholder
value targets are met.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' BASE SALARIES AND ANNUAL BONUSES 
The base salaries of executive directors are reviewed annually, having
regard to personal performance, company performance and competitive
market practice, as determined by external research.
During 2002, Mr J A Monville was employed by SPIE S.A., since 5 March
2003 a wholly owned subsidiary of AMEC, and his remuneration and
other terms and conditions were determined by SPIE. He received a fee
from AMEC for his board membership.
In 2002, the executive directors, except for Mr Monville, participated in the
AMEC executive annual bonus plan which generated bonus payments
calculated by reference to each of the following:
> growth in earnings;
> the achievement of specific business targets; and
> individual performance objectives.
A separate amount of bonus attaches to each of these components. 
The proportions vary between individuals depending on their specific
executive roles but in every case the earnings component represents 
at least half of the potential total. Mr Monville participated in a similar
scheme for SPIE senior executives.
Since the 2002 threshold profit target for bonus purposes under the
AMEC scheme was not achieved, no bonus was paid under this
component of the plan.
For 2002 the maximum potential annual bonus was 50 per cent of base
salary for UK based executive directors and 60 per cent for those based
in North America. In the light of the independent advice received on
market practice, the maximum potential annual bonus for 2003 will be
60 per cent for all executive directors.
No elements of remuneration other than base salary are pensionable
other than for Mr Monville whose base salary and annual bonus are
pensionable under the SPIE top-up scheme for senior executives.
44 AMEC plc ANNUAL REPORT 2002 EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' SHARE OPTIONS AND 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
New medium and long-term incentive arrangements were approved 
by shareholders in May 2002. These allow for annual awards under 
the Performance Share Plan 2002 of restricted shares of up to one times
annual base salary and annual grants of options under the Executive
Share Option Scheme with a face value up to two times annual base
salary, with the proviso that the present economic value of the combined
awards in any year cannot exceed one times annual base salary .
Awards were made in April 2002 under the Long-T erm Incentive Plan
(which is now discontinued and replaced by the Performance Share 
Plan 2002) to Sir Peter Mason, Mr J D Early, Mr P S Janson (the award
subsequently lapsed upon cessation of employment) and Mr S J Siddall.
The awards were in respect of restricted shares, with a value at the 
time of award of 50 per cent of base salary plus a further award of five
restricted shares (up to a maximum of 25 per cent of base salary) 
for every three acquired by the director and held on his behalf as
investment shares. 
Restricted shares will only vest if pre-determined performance
conditions are met. For full vesting, the requirement is for AMEC to be
ranked in the top quartile of total shareholder return, measured over a
three year period, of a comparator group of some 60 companies drawn
from the FTSE Construction and Building Materials, Engineering and
Machinery and Support Services sectors, whose market capitalisations
span that of AMEC. If AMEC's performance is at the median, 25 per cent
of the award will vest. Between the median and the upper quartile, the
award will vest on a straight line basis. No awards will vest if AMEC's
performance is below median or if the company's earnings per share
have grown by less than the rate of inflation plus six percentage points.
These performance conditions are intended to focus executives' attention
on the relative return which the company is delivering to its shareholders
over the medium-term relative to comparable alternative companies in
which shareholders could have invested. 
For the awards made in 1999, AMEC met the earnings per share growth
requirement and achieved a total shareholder return over the three 
year period of 141.5 per cent. This placed AMEC fifth out of forty-six
companies in the comparator group (after excluding those taken over 
or those who have had their listing suspended). The award therefore
vested in full.
The comparator companies for the awards which vested during the year
and those awards currently subsisting are as follows:

Grants were made in October 2002 under the Executive Share Option
Scheme 2002 to Sir Peter Mason, Mr J D Early and Mr S J Siddall of
options over a number of shares which, when multiplied by the option
price, equated to approximately 95 per cent of base salary . The option
price was based on the market value at the time of grant. 
Options will be exercisable in full if AMEC' s diluted earnings per share
growth, before exceptional items, exceeds the rate of inflation by at least
an average of nine percentage points per annum. This is measured
initially over a three year period and can be remeasured after four or five
years but, in such cases, over the full four or five year period. No part of
the option will be exercisable if the earnings per share growth does not
exceed the Retail Prices Index by an average of at least four percentage
points per annum.
The proportion of the option exercisable will increase on a straight line
basis between 25 per cent and 100 per cent if average annual earnings
per share growth in excess of the Retail Prices Index is between four 
and nine percentage points. Once exercisable, options may be exercised
up to the tenth anniversary of grant. This performance condition allows
executives the opportunity to accumulate significant capital over the long-
term, provided real and sustained earnings growth is delivered. 
In addition, executive directors may participate in relevant all-employee
share plans up to the limits of those schemes. Up to and including 2002,
the only such scheme has been the AMEC Savings Related Share 
Option Scheme for UK based employees which provides options, without
performance conditions, related to a savings contract with a limit of  250
maximum savings per month. 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' PENSION ENTITLEMENTS AND BENEFITS
The executive directors, except for Mr J A Monville, are members of the
AMEC Staff Pension Scheme and have top-up benefits provided through
the AMEC Executive Pension Scheme. The schemes are both approved
defined benefit schemes and also provide for life assurance cover and
dependents' pensions. The executive directors have a normal retirement
age of 60 and accrue pension rights which are linked to the length of
pensionable service and to final pensionable salary .
The benefits of Sir Peter Mason and Mr S J Siddall are restricted to 
take account of the earnings cap and they receive a taxable supplement 
to their salaries in relation to earnings above the cap.There are no
funded or unfunded unapproved arrangements in force for UK based
executive directors.
Mr Monville is a member of the SPIE top-up scheme for senior
executives, which provides additional pension payments on top of the
French State pension scheme to provide an aggregate pension of up to
50 per cent of pensionable salary at retirement.
Mr P S Janson was a member of the AMEC Inc. Senior Executive
Pension Plan, which provides for pension benefits at the normal
retirement age of 65 or at any time after 60, and also a member of the
AMEC Inc. Supplementary Executive Retirement Plan which provides 
for payment of a lump sum at retirement. 
Employment related benefits, principally the provision of a company 
car or car allowance, life assurance and private medical expenses
insurance, are also provided to executive directors, except for Mr Monville. 
46 AMEC plc ANNUAL REPORT 2002 EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS
The company's policy is that directors will normally be employed with 
a notice period of one year .
Sir Peter Mason, Mr J D Early, Mr D Robson, Mr G E Payne and
Mr S J Siddall had, during 2002, employment contracts with notice
periods of two years. Pursuant to agreements reached in February 2002,
with effect from 1 January 2003, the contractual notice period was
reduced to one year with provision that if the company terminates
employment (other than for gross misconduct), rather than receiving
notice, the individual will be entitled to one year's remuneration (less tax)
as liquidated damages in full and final settlement. For this purpose and,
as a reasonable estimate of loss, remuneration is defined as 1.75 times
basic annual salary to take account of salary, bonus potential, company
pension contributions, the value of benefits and compensation for loss 
of office.
Mr P S Janson left AMEC' s employment on 21 August 2002. He had an
employment contract with AMEC Inc. which provided for payment by the
company of 24 months ' pay in lieu of notice at 1.3 times his base salary . 
It was agreed that he would work three months of this period and he
received a severance payment of Cdn$1,342,000 ( 528,000) in respect 
of the balance. The remuneration committee exercised its discretion to
allow Mr Janson to retain options over 25,000 shares under the AMEC
Executive Share Option Scheme, with all other options and restricted
shares lapsing on termination. There were no enhancements to
Mr Janson' s pension entitlements. 
In accordance with the articles of association of the company, all directors
are required to seek re-election by shareholders every three years.
EXTERNAL DIRECTORSHIPS 
Executive directors are not permitted to accept external directorships
without the prior approval of the board.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The non-executive directors receive fees for their services and do not
participate in any of the incentive or benefit schemes of the group, 
except for Mr S Gillibrand, who has the provision of a company car and
life assurance cover . 
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the board
as a whole.
The board's current policy with regard to non-executive directors is that
appointments should be for a period of three years with provision for a
review upon expiry . Any extended term, mutually acceptable to both the
company and the director, will be for a period no greater than three
years, however, further renewal can be made in exceptional
circumstances.
PERFORMANCE GRAPH
The following graph (rebased to 100 as at 1 January 1998) charts the total
cumulative shareholder return of the company since 1 January 1998:
AMEC plc ANNUAL REPORT 2002 47
This graph is included to meet the new requirement to show the growth
in the value of a hypothetical  100 holding in AMEC plc ordinary shares
over five years relative to a broad equity market index. As the company' s
activities span a variety of sectors, the remuneration committee has
determined that AMEC' s relative performance is best judged against a
general market index and, therefore, the relative performance against
both the FTSE All Share and FTSE Mid 250 indices is shown. As additional
information, the performance against the FTSE Construction and
Building Materials sector, where AMEC is presently listed, is also shown.
