 AMEC plc Annual Report 2003 47
Directors '
Remuneration
Report
Remuneration packages comprise:
base salaries which broadly equate to the mid-market salary
practices of a relevant group of engineering, construction 
and support services comparator companies and other
companies regarded as comparable by virtue of, amongst 
other factors, their turnover, employee numbers, market
capitalisation and/or geographic coverage;
annual bonuses which incentivise the achievement of stretching
business and individual performance targets and offer the
opportunity to achieve upper quartile annual cash earnings 
if these targets are achieved; and 
medium and long-term incentives which align the interests 
of shareholders and senior executives by offering the latter 
the opportunity to accumulate significant capital over a period
if stretching shareholder value targets are met.
A significant proportion of the overall remuneration package 
is therefore performance related.
Executive Directors' Base Salaries and Annual Bonuses 
The base salaries of executive directors are reviewed annually,
having regard to personal performance, company performance
and competitive market practice, as determined by external
research. The following salaries have been approved from 
1 January 2004:
Sir Peter Mason  575,000
J D Early  262,500
J A Monville  370,000
C A Riva  460,000
S J Siddall  340,000
All executive directors participate in the AMEC executive annual
bonus plan which generates bonus payments calculated by
reference to each of the following:
the profit achievement of the group as compared to budget;
the achievement of other specific business targets (for example,
business unit profit and/or cash flow) as compared to budget; and 
individual performance objectives (for example, in relation 
to safety, strategy and/or organisational issues).
A separate amount of bonus attaches to each of these components.
The proportions vary between individuals depending on their specific
executive roles but in every case the profit and other business
target components represent at least half of the potential total. 
In addition, 10 per cent may be allocated to allow recognition of how
participants have responded to changing circumstances during the
year which cannot necessarily be addressed by predefined targets. 
For 2003, the maximum potential annual bonus was 60 per cent 
of base salary. This was increased to 80 per cent for Sir Peter Mason
and Mr Monville and included 20 per cent related to the success of
the integration of SPIE into AMEC. In the light of the independent
advice received on market practice, the maximum potential annual
bonus from 1 January 2004 will be 80 per cent for all executive
directors. This change has been brought about in order to give
effect to the stated competitive policy of offering the opportunity 
to achieve upper quartile annual cash earnings if stretching targets
are achieved. As indicated above, the performance targets and
elements have been reviewed to ensure that they remain stretching 
in relation to the increased maximum. 
No elements of remuneration other than base salary are pensionable
other than for Mr Monville, who is 59, and whose base salary
and ordinary annual bonus, up to a maximum of 60 per cent of
base salary, are pensionable. Mr Monville's pension arrangements
are covered on page 52 of this report. These arrangements are
common for senior executives in France and are a contractual
obligation that AMEC inherited with the acquisition of SPIE.
Mr Monville will retain these arrangements but it is not intended
that they will be extended to any other current or future
executive director .
This report covers the remuneration of executive and non-executive
directors and related matters, including grants of share options and
long-term incentive awards. 
Remuneration Committee Membership and Advisers
During the year, the members of the remuneration committee,
any three of whom may form a quorum, comprised Mr J A Dallas
(chairman), Mr S Gillibrand, Mr J M Green-Armytage, Ms E P Airey,
Ms M O Hesse and Mr J-P Jacamon. From 1 January 2004, in
accordance with the Combined Code regulations, the new chairman,
Mr J M Green-Armytage, will attend meetings by invitation but will
not be a member of the remuneration committee.
In considering the matters within its remit, the committee takes
account of recommendations from the chairman in respect of the
chief executive and from the chief executive in respect of other
executives and is advised by the group human resources director .
During 2003, the committee appointed New Bridge Street
Consultants LLP to provide standing advice to the committee 
in connection with its responsibilities. In addition, Hewitt Bacon
and Woodrow provided technical advice related to the application
of the total shareholder return performance condition under the
Performance Share Plan 2002 and the Long-Term Incentive Plan,
Watson Wyatt provided technical advice on the present economic
value of performance share and share option awards and CMS
Cameron McKenna provided advice in relation to executive directors'
service contracts. None of these organisations carried out additional
work for the company. Monks Partnership, in relation to the 
UK, and Towers Perrin, in relation to France, provided market
remuneration and benefits reports covering various levels of
management which, in respect of the executive directors, 
were reviewed by New Bridge Street Consultants. 
Remuneration Policy
The objective of the remuneration policy, in respect of the
executive directors and other senior executives, is to offer
remuneration packages that are competitive in the markets 
in which the executives are based and which:
allow AMEC to attract and retain senior executives of high calibre;
and
incentivise senior executives to achieve superior short-term
performance and increase the medium and long-term value 
of AMEC for its shareholders and encourage executives to build
and retain a significant shareholding in AMEC.

Executive Directors' Share Options and Long-Term Incentives
AMEC operates two long-term incentive arrangements. These
allow for annual awards under the Performance Share Plan 2002
of restricted shares of up to one times annual base salary and
annual grants of options under the Executive Share Option Scheme
2002 with a face value up to two times annual base salary, with
the proviso that the present economic value (that is, an assessment 
of the value today of an award, taking account of various factors
including the likelihood of vesting, using an adaptation of the
Black Scholes option pricing model) of the combined awards 
in any year cannot exceed one times annual base salary.
In relation to the Performance Share Plan 2002, current policy is
to make annual awards to executive directors of restricted shares,
with a value at the time of award of 75 per cent of base salary plus
a further award, up to a maximum of 25 per cent of base salary,
of five restricted shares for every three purchased by the director
and held on his behalf as investment shares. 
These restricted shares will only vest if pre-determined performance
conditions are met. For full vesting, the requirement is for AMEC
to be ranked in the top quartile of total shareholder return,
measured over a three year period, of a comparator group. 
This comprises the companies (approximately 60 in number) 
that, at the time of grant of each award, are in the FTSE All Share
Construction and Building Materials and Engineering and Machinery
sectors and the Support Services sector (except for the Education,
Business Training and Employment Agencies, Delivery Services,
Security and Alarm Services, Environmental Control and
Transaction and Payroll Services subsectors), whose market
capitalisations lie between  250 million and  3,000 million 
(or such other range as may be agreed from time to time spanning
that of AMEC). If AMEC's performance is at the median, 25 per
cent of the award will vest. Between the median and the upper
quartile, the award will vest on a straight line basis. No awards
will vest if AMEC's performance is below median or if AMEC's
earnings per share have grown by less than the rate of inflation
plus six percentage points. These performance conditions are
intended to focus executives' attention on the relative return which
AMEC is delivering to its shareholders over the medium-term
relative to broadly comparable alternative companies in which
shareholders could have invested. 
The comparator companies for the awards which lapsed during 
the year and those awards currently subsisting are as follows:

In relation to the Executive Share Option Scheme 2002, current
policy is to make annual grants to executive directors of options
over a number of shares which, when multiplied by the option
price, equates to approximately 100 per cent of base salary. The
option price is the market value around the time of grant. Higher
levels of award will only be made in exceptional circumstances, for
example, to new executives when this is considered appropriate to
secure their services and to incentivise their contribution. 
Subsisting options will be exercisable in full if AMEC's diluted
earnings per share growth, before exceptional items, exceeds the
rate of inflation by at least an average of nine percentage points
per annum. This is measured initially over a three year period 
and can be remeasured after four or five years but, in such cases,
over the full four or five year period. No part of the option will 
be exercisable if the earnings per share growth does not exceed
the Retail Prices Index by an average of at least four percentage
points per annum.
The proportion of the option exercisable will increase on a straight
line basis between 25 per cent and 100 per cent if average annual
earnings per share growth in excess of the Retail Prices Index is
between four and nine percentage points. Once exercisable, options
may be exercised up to the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
This performance condition allows executives the opportunity to
accumulate significant capital over the long-term, provided real
and sustained earnings growth is delivered. 
In the light of independent advice on current remuneration practice
and a review of future economic conditions since the plan was
established, the committee is consulting with AMEC's principal
shareholders with a view to modifying the earnings per share
targets and removing the retest after five years for the awards
which it anticipates making in 2004.
In addition, executive directors may participate in relevant all-
employee share plans up to the limits of those schemes. Up to
and including 2003, the only such scheme has been the AMEC
Savings Related Share Option Scheme for UK based employees
which provides options, without performance conditions, related
to a savings contract with a limit of  250 maximum savings 
per month. 
Executive Directors' Pension Entitlements and Benefits
The executive directors, except for Mr J A Monville, are members
of the AMEC Staff Pension Scheme and have top-up benefits
provided through the AMEC Executive Pension Scheme. The
schemes are both approved defined benefit schemes and also
provide for life assurance cover and dependants' pensions. 
These executive directors have a normal retirement age of 60 
and accrue pension rights which are linked to the length of
pensionable service and to final pensionable salary.
The benefits of Sir Peter Mason, Mr S J Siddall and Mr C A Riva
are restricted to take account of the earnings cap and they receive
a taxable supplement to their salaries in relation to earnings
above the cap. There are no funded or unfunded unapproved
arrangements in force for executive directors.
Mr Monville is a member of the SPIE top-up scheme for senior
executives, which provides additional pension payments on top 
of the French compulsory arrangements to provide an aggregate
pension of up to 50 per cent of pensionable pay at retirement. 
Due to French tax rules, this additional pension does not vest until
the point of retirement. Mr Monville may retire with the agreement
of AMEC from age 60 and must retire by age 65.
Employment related benefits, principally the provision of a company
car or car allowance, life assurance and private medical expenses
insurance, are also provided to executive directors. 
Executive Directors' Employment Contracts
AMEC's policy, since 1 January 2003, is that directors will normally
be employed with a notice period of one year and that, in the event
of employment being terminated with less notice than this, damages
will be determined at the time taking account of the circumstances
leading up to the termination and the individual's duty to mitigate
his loss.

Directors' Remuneration Report
continued
The current chairman's fee is  200,000 per annum irrespective 
of time commitment. 
The board's current policy with regard to non-executive directors
is that appointments should be for a period of three years with
provision for a review upon expiry. Any extended term, mutually
acceptable to both AMEC and the director, will normally be for 
a period no greater than three years, however, further renewal
can be made in exceptional circumstances.
Performance Graph

the total cumulative shareholder return of the company since 
1 January 1999:

This graph shows the growth in the value of a hypothetical  100
holding in AMEC plc ordinary shares over five years relative to
abroad equity market index. As the company's activities span
avariety of sectors, the remuneration committee has determined
that AMEC's relative performance is best judged against a
general market index and, therefore, the relative performance
against both the FTSE All Share and FTSE Mid 250 indices is
shown. As additional information, the performance against the
FTSE Construction and Building Materials Sector, where AMEC
is presently listed, is also shown.

Until the end of 2002 Sir Peter Mason, Mr J D Early and 
Mr S J Siddall, had employment contracts with notice periods 
of two years. This was reduced without compensation to one 
year by agreement earlier in 2002 but with provision that if the
company terminates employment (other than for gross misconduct),
rather than receiving notice, the individual will be entitled to one
year's remuneration (less tax) as liquidated damages in full and
final settlement. For this purpose and, as a reasonable estimate 
of loss, remuneration is defined as 1.75 times basic annual salary
to take account of salary, bonus potential, pension arrangements,
the value of benefits and compensation for loss of office.
Mr J A Monville is employed as chairman of AMEC SPIE S.A. 
As a governing executive (mandataire social) any compensation 
for loss of office would be subject to negotiation under French law.
Discussions are taking place with Mr Monville with a view to
agreeing a contract which reflects AMEC's UK practice.
In accordance with the articles of association of AMEC, all directors
are required to seek re-election by shareholders every three years.
External Directorships 
Executive directors are not permitted to accept external director-
ships without the prior approval of the board. With such approval,
Sir Peter Mason became a non-executive director of BAe Systems
plc with effect from 22 January 2003. He retains the fee of  50,000
per annum which he receives in relation to this appointment.
Non-Executive Directors
The OAP non-executive directors receive fees for their services
and do not participate in any of the incentive or benefit schemes of 
the group (except for Mr S Gillibrand, who was provided, until 
his retirement, with a company car and life assurance cover).
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the
chairman and the executive directors under delegated authority
from the board. The current fee is  30,000 per annum plus a
further  5,000 per annum in respect of chairing one or more
committees of the board. Additional fees are payable for days 
in excess of 20 per annum at the rate of  1,500 per day.

Notes
(i) No options were exercised during the year .
(ii) Mr G E Payne's savings related option over 3,942 shares at 230p lapsed upon his retirement on 31 March 2003.
(iii) The terms and conditions of the Option Schemes have not been varied during the year . All awards were at nil cost.
(iv) Certain of the options were capable of being exercised on 31 December 2003 as all performance conditions had been met. If the options had been
exercised on that date the approximate gain before appropriate taxes for each of the current directors would have been: Sir Peter Mason,  1,490,000;
Mr Early,  58,000 and Mr Siddall,  44,500. Had the remainder of the options been capable of being exercised and vested in full on 31 December 2003,
the approximate latent gain before appropriate taxes for each of the current directors would have been: Sir Peter Mason,  90,000; Mr Early,  44,000
and Mr Siddall,  49,500. These hypothetical figures assume that all performance conditions will be fully met, which may not in practice transpire.
The Performance Share Plan 2002 (the  PSP') was approved by shareholders in 2002. The PSP replaced the Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(the  Plan') which was introduced in 1998. The design of the PSP took account of the provisions of Schedule  A' to the Combined Code.
The number of restricted shares held by the executive directors to whom awards have been made under the PSP and the Plan were as follows:

Notes
(i) The first share awards, as determined by the remuneration committee, were made under the PSP on 15 April 2003 to Sir Peter Mason, 
Mr J D Early, Mr S J Siddall and Mr J A Monville at a market price of 228.25 pence and to Mr C A Riva, in accordance with the terms of his
employment agreement, on 28 August 2003 at a market price of 268.50 pence.
(ii) For the awards made in April 2000, AMEC met the earnings per share growth requirement but failed to meet the total shareholder 
return requirement and, therefore, the awards lapsed in April 2003.
(iii) The terms and conditions of the PSP and the Plan have not been varied during the year .
(iv) The closing price of the shares at 31 December 2003 was 260.00 pence (2002: 143.25 pence).
(v) The range of the closing prices for the shares during the year was 143.25 pence to 289.00 pence.
(vi) The register of directors' interests, which is open to inspection at the company's registered office, contains full details of directors' 
shareholdings, share options and awards under the PSP and the Plan.
(vii) Had the above restricted shares been vested in full on 31 December 2003, the approximate latent value before appropriate taxes for each 
of the current directors would have been: Sir Peter Mason,  961,500; Mr Early,  459,000; Mr Siddall,  493,000; Mr Monville,  349,000 and
Mr Riva,  436,000. These hypothetical figures assume that all performance conditions will be fully met, which may not in practice transpire.

Notes
(i) Pension accruals shown are the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year .
(ii) Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with version 1.5 of guidance note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession.
(iii) The value of net increase (b) represents the incremental value to the director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption service
terminated at the year-end. It is based on the accrued pension increase (a) after deducting the director's contribution. The change in the transfer
value is shown as a negative amount for Mr D Robson and for Mr G E Payne. This reflects the fact that, over the course of the year, the value of
the pension payable has in fact reduced. In each case, the member could have taken an unreduced pension on early retirement at 1 January 2003.
A pension payable for an individual at any particular age is more valuable than that payable for the same individual assuming it starts one year later .
(iv) The change in the transfer value (c) includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the 
company and directors, such as stockmarket movements. It is calculated after deducting the director's contribution.
(v) Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
Mr J A Monville is a member of the SPIE top-up pension scheme for senior executives. Although the scheme, arranged through an insurance
company, is a defined benefit scheme it is not possible to disclose his pension benefits in the above format. A pension is payable by SPIE only 
in the event of Mr Monville reaching his normal retirement age of 65 or, following the attainment of age 60, by agreement with AMEC. No
pension is due or payable in other circumstances and Mr Monville currently has no accrued right to a pension payment. His pension at the
normal retirement age, or as agreed by AMEC, would be based on the average of his last three years base salary and bonus, up to a maximum
of 20 per cent of this figure. As at 31 December 2003, this would equate to  94,000 (1134,000) per annum. It is not possible to attribute a value
to the accrued funds as these are not separately identified by the insurance company.
