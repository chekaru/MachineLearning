 AMEC plc annual report 2004 49
Directors' remuneration
report
annual bonuses which incentivise the achievement of stretching
business and individual performance targets and offer the opportunity
to achieve upper quartile annual cash earnings if these targets
are achieved; and 
medium and long-term incentives which align the interests
of shareholders and senior executives by offering the latter the
opportunity to accumulate significant capital over a period but 
only if stretching shareholder value targets are met.
More than half of the overall remuneration package is therefore
performance related.
Executive directors' base salaries and annual bonuses
The base salaries of executive directors are reviewed annually,
having regard to personal performance, company performance,
competitive market practice as determined by external research
and pay levels more broadly within the company. The following
salaries have been approved from 1 January 2005, representing
an average increase of approximately five per cent:
Sir Peter Mason  610,000
J D Early  277,500
J A Monville ( 546,000 equivalent)  386,500
S J Siddall  360,000
C A Riva  475,000
All executive directors participate in the AMEC executive annual
bonus plan which generates bonus payments calculated by reference
to each of the following:
the profit achievement of the group, with a target level of bonus
payable for achieving budget and the maximum pay-out requiring
achievement of a more stretching target;
the achievement of other specific business targets, including cash
flow and business unit profit; and 
individual performance objectives (for example, in relation
to safety, strategy and organisational issues).
A separate amount of bonus attaches to each of these components.
The proportions vary between individuals depending on their specific
executive roles. In addition, 10 per cent may be allocated to allow
recognition of how participants have responded to changing
circumstances during the year which cannot necessarily be addressed
by predefined targets. The maximum potential annual bonus is
80 per cent of base salary. In every case the profit and other business
target components represent more than half of the potential total.
No elements of remuneration other than base salary are pensionable
other than for Mr Monville, who is 60, and whose base salary and
ordinary annual bonus, up to a maximum of 60 per cent of base
salary, are pensionable. Mr Monville's pension arrangements are
covered on page 54 of this report. These arrangements are common
for senior executives in France and are a contractual obligation that
AMEC inherited with the acquisition of SPIE S.A. 
In the senior management group immediately below board level, 
no executive has a base salary or total remuneration higher than 
any executive director .
This report covers the remuneration of executive and non-executive
directors and related matters, including long-term incentive awards. 
Remuneration committee membership and advisers
During the year, the members of the remuneration committee,
any three of whom may form a quorum, comprised Mr J A Dallas
(chairman), Ms E P Airey, Ms M O Hesse and Mr J-P Jacamon.
In accordance with the Combined Code regulations, the chairman,
Mr J M Green-Armytage, attends meetings by invitation but is not
a member of the remuneration committee.
In considering the matters within its remit, the committee takes
account of recommendations from the chairman in respect of the
chief executive and from the chief executive in respect of other
executives and is advised by the group human resources director . 
During 2004, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (New Bridge Street )
continued to provide standing advice to the committee in connection
with its responsibilities. New Bridge Street does not carry out
additional work for the company. The terms of engagement between
the company and New Bridge Street are available from the company
secretary. Monks Partnership, in relation to the UK, and Towers
Perrin, particularly in relation to France and the USA, provided
market remuneration and benefits reports covering various levels
of management which, in respect of the executive directors, were
reviewed by New Bridge Street. 
Remuneration policy
The objective of the remuneration policy, in respect of the executive
directors and other senior executives, is to offer remuneration
packages that are competitive in the markets in which the executives
are based and which:
allow AMEC to attract and retain senior executives of high
calibre; and
incentivise senior executives to achieve superior short-term
performance and increase the medium and long-term value of AMEC
for its shareholders and encourage executives to build and retain
a significant shareholding in AMEC.
Remuneration packages comprise:
base salaries which broadly equate to the mid-market salary
practices of a relevant group of support services, engineering
and construction comparator companies and other companies
regarded as comparable by virtue of, amongst other factors,
turnover, employee numbers, market capitalisation and/or
geographic coverage; 50 AMEC plc annual report 2004
The present economic value of performance share awards made
on this basis in 2004 has been assessed by Watson Wyatt LLP
as 40 per cent of face value.
Awards under the Executive Share Option Scheme 2002 are made
at an option price based on the market value at the time of grant
and are subject to meeting earnings per share (EPS ) performance
conditions measured over a fixed three year period as detailed below. 
Face value of shares EPS performance - Percentage of
under option growth per annum award vesting
Up to RPI +3 per cent 25 per cent
1 x base salary to RPI +5 per cent to 100 per cent
Any award above RPI +5 per cent 0 per cent
1 x base salary to RPI +9 per cent to 100 per cent
Once exercisable, options may be exercised up to the tenth
anniversary of the date of grant.
The present economic value of options granted on this basis in 2004
has been assessed by Watson Wyatt LLP as 17.5 per cent of face value.
During the transition to international financial reporting standards,
the Remuneration Committee will aim to ensure that performance
measurement for remuneration purposes will be consistent year
on year .
In addition, executive directors may participate in relevant all-
employee share plans which provide options, without performance
conditions, related to savings contracts with an aggregate limit 
of  250 maximum savings per month. 
Executive directors' pension entitlements and benefits
The executive directors, except for Mr J A Monville, are members
of the AMEC Staff Pension Scheme and have top-up benefits
provided through the AMEC Executive Pension Scheme. The
schemes are both approved defined benefit schemes and also
provide for life assurance cover and dependants' pensions. These
executive directors have a normal retirement age of 60 and accrue
pension rights which are linked to the length of pensionable service
and to final pensionable salary.
The benefits of Sir Peter Mason, Mr S J Siddall and Mr C A Riva
are restricted to take account of the earnings cap and they receive
a taxable supplement to their salaries in relation to earnings above
the cap. There are no funded or unfunded unapproved arrangements
in force for executive directors.
The review of policy on UK executive pensions has still to be
concluded following the introduction of the new tax regime that
comes into force in April 2006, but the Remuneration Committee
currently believes that:
Pensions should not be provided routinely in excess of the
Life Time Allowance;
The payment of any tax liability of employees will be the
responsibility of the individual and not AMEC;
The scheme design going forward should be aimed at achieving
a benefit equivalent to the life-time limit over 20 years service for
those executives who would currently have a 1/30ths accrual rate
and 30 years for those with a 1/45ths accrual rate. This would involve
applying a new scheme-specific earnings cap i.e. only earnings up 
to a certain level will be used to calculate the final salary-related
pension; and
Salary supplements may continue to be used, where appropriate.

Executive directors' long-term incentives
AMEC has in recent years operated two long-term incentive
arrangements, the Performance Share Plan 2002 and the Executive
Share Option Scheme 2002. In the light of market practice and
the introduction of international financial reporting standards, it has
been concluded that forward practice should be to make annual
awards of performance shares only. Major shareholders have been
consulted on this change of policy and as a result AMEC will be
seeking approval at the annual general meeting to increase the limit
of annual awards under the Performance Share Plan to a maximum
face value of two times' salary, with the continuing proviso that
the present economic value (PEV ) of all long-term incentive awards
to an individual in any year cannot exceed one times annual base
salary (PEV is an assessment of the value today of an award, taking
account of various factors including the likelihood of vesting, using
an adaptation of the Black Scholes option pricing model). Subject
to shareholders approving this proposal, in future share options would
only be granted in exceptional circumstances such as recruitment.
Assuming such approval, AMEC's policy for 2005 and beyond will be
to make awards each year to executive directors, and to a very small
number of other senior executives just below board level, of restricted
shares with a value at the time of award of up to 175 per cent of base
salary. In addition participants will be offered a further award, up
to a maximum of 25 per cent of base salary, of five restricted shares
for every three purchased from their previous year's post-tax bonus
and held on their behalf as investment shares for the full three year
performance period. Awards are also made to a wider group of
executives, with lower levels of face value to reflect seniority and
contribution. Awards are not normally made to those within
12 months of retirement and, where the individual is within three years
of retirement, the size of award has regard to the executive's ability
to contribute to the achievement of the performance conditions.
These restricted shares will only vest if pre-determined performance
conditions are met. For full vesting, the requirement is for AMEC
to be ranked in the top quartile of total shareholder return, measured
over a three year period, of a comparator group. This comprises the
companies (approximately 40 in number) that, at the time of grant of
each award, are in the FTSE All Share Business Support, Environmental
Control, Other Construction and Oil Services sub-sectors, and whose
market capitalisations lie between  250 million and  3,000 million
(or such other range spanning that of AMEC as may be agreed from
time to time). If AMEC's performance is at the median, 25 per cent 
of the award will vest. 100 per cent of the award will vest at upper
quartile. Between the median and the upper quartile, the award 
will vest on a straight-line basis. No awards will vest if AMEC's
performance is below median. As a further threshold condition, 
to ensure that the company's underlying performance is properly
reflected, no awards will vest if AMEC's earnings per share have
grown by less than the rate of inflation plus six percentage points
over the three year period. 
These performance conditions are intended to focus executives'
attention on the return that AMEC is delivering to its shareholders
over the medium-term relative to broadly comparable alternative
companies in which shareholders could have invested. Lists of the
comparator companies for the awards that lapsed during the year
and those awards currently subsisting can be obtained on request
from the company secretary. AMEC plc annual report 2004 51
Mr Monville is a member of the SPIE top-up scheme for senior
executives, which provides additional pension of up to 20 per cent
of pensionable salary on top of the French compulsory social
security and industry arrangements, subject to an aggregate limit
of 50 per cent of pensionable pay at retirement. Due to French tax
rules, this additional pension does not vest until the point of retirement.
Mr Monville may retire with the agreement of AMEC from age 60
and must retire by age 65.
Employment related benefits, principally the provision of a company
car or car allowance, life assurance and private medical expenses
insurance, are also provided to executive directors. 
Executive directors' employment contracts
AMEC's policy is that on appointment, executive directors will
normally be employed with a notice period of one year . In the event 
of employment being terminated with less notice than this, damages
will be determined at the time taking account of the circumstances
leading up to the termination and the individual's duty to mitigate
his loss. Mr C A Riva who was appointed in August 2003 has a
contract on this basis.
During 2001 the Remuneration Committee decided to change the
policy on notice periods from two years to one year . Sir Peter Mason,
Mr J D Early and Mr S J Siddall, had employment contracts with
notice periods of two years. These were reduced by agreement to
one year from 1 January 2003 without compensation but with
provision that if the company terminates employment (other than for
gross misconduct), rather than receiving notice, the individual will be
entitled to one year's remuneration (less tax) as liquidated damages
in full and final settlement. For this purpose and, as a reasonable
estimate of loss, remuneration is defined as 1.75 times basic annual
salary to take account of salary, bonus potential, pension arrangements,
the value of benefits and compensation for loss of office.
Mr J A Monville is employed by SPIE S.A. as chairman. As a
governing executive (mandataire social) any compensation for loss 
of office would be subject to negotiation under French law.
External directorships 
Executive directors are not permitted to accept external directorships
without the prior approval of the board. Sir Peter Mason is a non-
executive director of BAe Systems plc. He retains the fee of  50,000
per annum which he receives in relation to this appointment. 
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors receive fees for their services and do not
participate in any of the incentive or benefit schemes of the group,
other than Mr J M Green-Armytage who is provided with life
assurance cover of four times the Inland Revenue pensions earnings
cap. The chairman's current fee is  200,000 per annum. 
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by
the chairman and the executive directors under delegated authority
from the board. The current fee is  30,000 per annum plus a further
 5,000 per annum in respect of chairing one or more committees
of the board. Additional fees are payable for days in excess of 20 per
annum at the rate of  1,500 per day. 
Following a review of governance, a change has been made
to the board's policy in relation to the term of office of non-executive
directors. The board has concluded that, given the changed
emphasis of the company to an increasingly complex international
long-term project management and services business, it is appropriate
that non-executive director appointments should be for three
consecutive three year terms, subject to review after the end of each
term. The previous policy was that appointments should be for three
years with provision for a review on expiry and that any extended
term would normally be for no greater than three years, however
further renewal could be made in exceptional circumstances.
The non-executive directors as at 31 December 2004 have fixed term
contracts which run until the dates set out below:
Date of contract Service review date
J M Green-Armytage 21 January 2004 20 January 2007
E P Airey 26 May 1999 25 May 2005
J A Dallas 28 October 1999 27 October 2005
M O Hesse 1 June 2000 31 May 2006
J-P Jacamon 27 November 2002 27 November 2005
The contract of the chairman, Mr Green-Armytage, contains
provision for six months' written notice of resignation prior to the
expiry date and payment of six months' fees if the board withdraw
their agreement to his continuing to serve as chairman, other than
for gross misconduct. The contracts of the other non-executive
directors may be terminated by the individual at any time and there
are no specific provisions for compensation in the event of early
termination by the company.
In accordance with the articles of association of AMEC, all directors
are required to seek re-election by shareholders every three years.
Performance graph
The following graph (rebased to 100 as at 1 January 2000) charts
the total cumulative shareholder return of the company since
1 January 2000:
This graph shows the growth in the value of a hypothetical  100
holding in AMEC plc ordinary shares over five years relative to a
broad equity market index. As the company's activities span a variety
of sectors, the remuneration committee has determined that AMEC's
relative performance is best judged against a general market index
and, therefore, the relative performance against the FTSE Mid 250
index is shown. As additional information, the performance against
the FTSE Construction and Building Materials Sector, where AMEC
was listed until 22 November 2004, and the FTSE Support Services
sector, where AMEC is currently listed, are also shown.

Notes
(i) Sir Peter Mason's salary includes a taxable supplement in relation to earnings above the earnings cap for pension purposes of  95,000
(2003:  88,000).
(ii) Mr Monville's salary comprised  480,000 paid by SPIE S.A. and  30,000 paid by AMEC plc
(iii) Mr Siddall's salary includes a taxable supplement in relation to earnings above the earnings cap for pension purposes of  48,000
(2003:  42,000).
(iv) Mr Riva's salary includes a taxable supplement in relation to earnings above the earnings cap for pension purposes of  72,000
(2003:  29,000).
(v) The bonuses detailed above represented the following percentages of their base salaries for the year against a maximum potential 80 per
cent: Sir Peter Mason 41.5 per cent, Mr Early 52.9 per cent, Mr Monville 49.9 per cent, Mr Siddall 43.5 per cent and Mr Riva 30.4 per cent.
These reflected the achievement of AMEC plc profit performance that was midway between the threshold and stretch targets set at the
start of the year and varying achievement against specific business targets and personal objectives. 
(vi) The value of benefits in kind received during the year relates principally to the provision of a company car or car allowance, travelling
expenses, life assurance and private medical expenses insurance. Unemployment insurance is also made available to Mr Monville in
accordance with French practice and certain relocation expenses have been reimbursed to Mr Riva. None of these benefits are pensionable. AMEC plc annual report 2004 53

(iv) The performance conditions applied to awards made under the Executive Share Option Schemes during the year were varied from
previous years, including the removal of the facility to retest. All awards were at nil cost.
(v) Certain of the options were capable of being exercised as at 31 December 2004 as all performance conditions had been met. If the options
had been exercised on that date the approximate gain before appropriate taxes for each of the current directors would have been:
Sir Peter Mason,  1,900,000 and Mr Early,  76,875. Had the remainder of the options been capable of being exercised and vested in full
as at 31 December 2004, the approximate latent gain before appropriate taxes for each of the current directors would have been: Sir Peter
Mason,  213,000; Mr Early,  99,420; Mr Siddall,  118,000; Mr Monville,  29,000 and Mr Riva,  70,000. These hypothetical figures assume
that all performance conditions will be fully met, which may not in practice transpire.
The Performance Share Plan 2002 (the  PSP') was approved by shareholders in 2002. The PSP replaced the Long-Term Incentive Plan
(the  LTIP') which was introduced in 1998. The design of the PSP took account of the provisions of Schedule  A' to the Combined Code.
The number of restricted shares held by executive directors to whom awards had been made under the PSP and the LTIP were as follows:

Notes
(i) Awards, as determined by the remuneration committee, were made under the PSP on 14 April 2004 to Sir Peter Mason, Mr J D Early,
Mr S J Siddall, Mr J A Monville and Mr C A Riva at a market price of 300.00 pence.
(ii) For the LTIP awards made in April 2001, AMEC failed to meet the minimum performance conditions and, therefore, the awards lapsed 
in April 2004.
(iii) For the LTIP awards made in April 2002, AMEC failed to meet the earnings per share performance condition and, therefore, these awards
will lapse in April 2005. 
(iv) The terms and conditions of the PSP and the LTIP have not been varied during the year .
(v) The closing price of the shares at 31 December 2004 was 297.75 pence (2003: 260.00 pence).
(vi) The range of the closing prices for the shares during the year was 252.25 pence to 342.00 pence.
(vii) The register of directors' interests, which is open to inspection at the company's registered office, contains full details of directors'
shareholdings, share options and awards under the PSP and the LTIP .
(viii) Had the restricted shares detailed above vested in full as at 31 December 2004 the approximate latent value before appropriate taxes 
for each of the current directors would have been: Sir Peter Mason,  1,466,000; Mr Early,  689,000; Mr Siddall,  763,000; Mr Monville,
 696,000; and Mr Riva,  956,000. These hypothetical figures assume that all performance conditions will be fully met, which may not in
practice transpire.

service terminated at the year-end. It is based on the accrued pension increase after deducting the director's contribution. 
(iv) The change in the transfer value includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the company
and directors, such as stock market movements. It is calculated after deducting the director's contribution.
(v) Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
Mr J A Monville is a member of the SPIE top-up pension scheme for senior executives. Although the scheme, arranged through an insurance
company, is a defined benefit scheme, it is not possible to disclose his pension benefits in the above format. A pension is payable by SPIE
only in the event of Mr Monville reaching his normal retirement age of 65 or, following the attainment of age 60, by agreement with AMEC.
No pension is due or payable in other circumstances and Mr Monville currently has no accrued right to a pension payment. His pension
at the normal retirement age, or as agreed by AMEC, would be based on the average of his last three years base salary and bonus, up
to a maximum of 20 per cent of this figure. As at 31 December 2004, this would equate to  106,000 ( 149,000) (2003:  94,000 ( 134,000)) 
per annum. It is not possible to attribute a value to the accrued funds as these are not separately identified by the insurance company.
