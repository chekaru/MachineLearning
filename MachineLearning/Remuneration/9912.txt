 This report covers the remuneration of executive and non-executive
directors and related matters, including long-term incentive awards.
Remuneration committee membership and advisers
During the year, the members of the remuneration committee, 
any three of whom may form a quorum, comprised Mr J A Dallas
(chairman), Ms E P Airey, Ms M O Hesse, Mr J-P Jacamon and,
following their appointments as directors, Mr P J Byrom and 
Mr T W Faithfull. In accordance with the Combined Code regulations,
the chairman of the board, Mr J M Green-Armytage, attends
meetings by invitation but is not a member of the remuneration
committee. The committee's terms of reference are available on 
the company's website and on request from the company secretary.
In considering the matters within its remit, the committee takes
account of recommendations from the chairman in respect of the
chief executive and from the chief executive in respect of other
executives and is advised by the group human resources director .
During 2005, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (New Bridge Street )
continued to provide standing advice to the committee in connection
with its responsibilities. New Bridge Street does not carry out material
additional work for the company. The terms of engagement between
the company and New Bridge Street are available from the company
secretary. Monks Partnership, in relation to the UK, and Towers
Perrin, particularly in relation to France and the US, provided market
remuneration and benefits reports covering various levels of
management which, in respect of the executive directors, were
reviewed by New Bridge Street.
Remuneration policy
The objective of the remuneration policy, in respect of the executive
directors and other senior executives, is to offer remuneration
packages that are competitive in the markets in which the executives
are based and which:
allow AMEC to attract and retain senior executives of high 
calibre; and
incentivise senior executives to achieve superior short-term
performance and increase the medium and long-term value 
of AMEC for its shareholders and encourage executives to build 
and retain a significant shareholding in AMEC.
Remuneration packages comprise:
base salaries which broadly equate to the mid-market salary
practices of a relevant group of support services, engineering and
construction comparator companies and other companies regarded
as comparable by virtue of, amongst other factors, revenue, employee
numbers, market capitalisation and/or geographic coverage;
annual bonuses which incentivise the achievement of stretching
business and individual performance targets and offer the opportunity
to achieve upper quartile annual cash earnings if these targets are
achieved; and
medium and long-term incentives which align the interests 
of shareholders and senior executives by offering the latter the
opportunity to accumulate significant capital over a period but 
only if stretching shareholder value targets are met.
More than half of the overall remuneration package is therefore
performance related.
Executive directors' base salaries and annual bonuses
The base salaries of executive directors are reviewed annually,
having regard to personal performance, company performance,
competitive market practice as determined by external research 
and pay levels more broadly within the company. The following
salaries have been approved from 1 January 2006, representing 
an increase of 5 per cent:
Sir Peter Mason  640,500
J D Early  291,375
J A Monville ( 393,900 equivalent)  573,300
S J Siddall  378,000
All executive directors participate in the AMEC executive annual
bonus plan which generates bonus payments calculated by reference
to each of the following:
the profit achievement of the group, with a target level of bonus
payable for achieving budget and the maximum pay-out requiring
achievement of a more stretching target;
the achievement of other specific business targets, including 
cash flow and business unit profit; and
individual performance objectives (for example, in relation to
safety, strategy, business development and organisational issues).
A separate amount of bonus attaches to each of these components.
The proportions vary between individuals depending on their specific
executive roles. In addition, 10 per cent may be allocated to allow
recognition of how participants have responded to changing
circumstances during the year which cannot necessarily be addressed
by pre-defined targets. The maximum potential annual bonus is 80
per cent of base salary. In every case the profit and other business
target components represent more than half of the potential total.
For Mr J A Monville, in the event that the sale of AMEC SPIE is
completed during 2006, and recognising his key role in achieving 
a successful transaction, it is intended to replace the normal annual
bonus with a special incentive linked to the sale proceeds on a sliding
scale above a minimum threshold and subject to the achievement 
in the business being divested of at least budgeted profit in the period
prior to the sale. While there will be no absolute maximum, the
structure of this incentive is designed to pay 2 x normal maximum
annual bonus at a plausible top-end proceeds level. A number 
of other senior AMEC SPIE executives are also included in this
arrangement but with lower potential payments.
No elements of remuneration other than base salary are pensionable
other than for Mr Monville, who is 61, and whose base salary and
ordinary annual bonus, up to a maximum of 60 per cent of base
salary, are pensionable. Mr Monville's pension arrangements are
covered on page 66 of this report. These arrangements are common
for senior executives in France and are a contractual obligation that
AMEC inherited with the acquisition of SPIE S.A.
In the senior management group, no executive has a base salary 
or total remuneration higher than any executive director .
AMEC plc annual report 2005 61
Directors' remuneration
report Executive directors' long-term incentives
AMEC's principal long-term incentive arrangement is the
Performance Share Plan 2002. Following approval by shareholders 
at the annual general meeting in May 2005, AMEC's policy is to make
annual awards to executive directors, and to a small number of other
senior executives just below board level, of restricted shares with 
a value at the time of award of up to 175 per cent of base salary. 
In addition, participants are offered a further award, up to a maximum
of 25 per cent of base salary, of five restricted shares for every three
purchased from their previous year's post-tax bonus and held on
their behalf as investment shares for the full three year performance
period. Awards are also made to a wider group of executives, with
lower levels of face value to reflect seniority and contribution. Awards
are not normally made to those within one year of retirement and,
where the individual is within three years of retirement, the size of
award has regard to the executive's ability to contribute to the
achievement of the performance conditions.
These restricted shares will only vest if pre-determined performance
conditions are met. For full vesting, the requirement is for AMEC 
to be ranked in the top quartile of total shareholder return, measured
over a three year period, of a comparator group. This currently
comprises the companies (approximately 40 in number) that, at 
the time of grant of each award, are in the FTSE All Share Business
Support, Environmental Control, Other Construction and Oil Services
sub-sectors, and whose market capitalisations lie between 
 250 million and  3,000 million (or such other range spanning that 
of AMEC as may be agreed from time to time). If AMEC's performance
is at the median, 25 per cent of the award will vest. 100 per cent 
of the award will vest at upper quartile. Between the median and 
the upper quartile, the award will vest on a straight-line basis. 
No awards will vest if AMEC's performance is below median. As a
further threshold condition, to ensure that the company's underlying
performance is properly reflected, no awards will vest if AMEC's
earnings per share have grown by less than the rate of inflation 
plus six percentage points over the three year period.
These performance conditions are intended to focus executives'
attention on the return that AMEC is delivering to its shareholders
over the medium term relative to broadly comparable alternative
companies in which shareholders could have invested. Lists of the
comparator companies for the awards that lapsed during the year
and those awards currently subsisting can be obtained on request
from the company secretary.
For 2005, awards were made in two tranches - in April, under 
the previous limits, and in September to reflect the revised limits
approved by shareholders. For subsequent years it is envisaged 
that awards will normally be made in a single tranche in April.
The present economic value of performance share awards made 
in 2005 has been assessed by Watson Wyatt LLP as 40 per cent 
of face value.
The company has a second scheme in place - the Executive Share
Option Scheme 2002. AMEC's policy is now only to grant share
options under this scheme selectively and in exceptional
circumstances such as recruitment. No awards were made 
under this scheme during 2005.
During the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards,
the remuneration committee will aim to ensure that performance
measurement for remuneration purposes will be consistent year on year .
In addition, executive directors may participate in relevant all employee
share plans which provide options, without performance conditions,
related to savings contracts with an aggregate limit of  250 savings
per month.
Executive directors' pension entitlements and benefits
The executive directors, except for Mr J A Monville and, with effect
from 31 October 2005, Mr J D Early, are members of the AMEC Staff
Pension Scheme and have top-up benefits provided through the
AMEC Executive Pension Scheme. The schemes are both approved
defined benefit schemes and also provide for life assurance cover
and dependants' pensions. These executive directors have a normal
retirement age of 60 and accrue pension rights which are linked 
to the length of pensionable service and to final pensionable salary.
The benefits of Sir Peter Mason and Mr S J Siddall are restricted 
to take account of the statutory earnings cap and they receive a
taxable supplement to their salaries in relation to earnings above 
the cap. There are no funded or unfunded unapproved arrangements
in force for executive directors. These arrangements also applied 
to Mr C A Riva. 
As referred to above, Mr J D Early ceased to be an active member of
the AMEC Staff and Executive pension schemes on 31 October 2005
and consequently is not accruing further benefits under either scheme.
Since 1 November 2005, he has been paid a salary supplement in
lieu of further pension accrual. 
A review of policy on UK executive pensions has been undertaken 
in the light of the new tax regime that comes into force in April 2006.
All decisions on this matter were delegated by the board to the
remuneration committee to avoid executive directors' conflicts 
of interest. The following are the key features, which will apply 
from April 2006:
There will be a new scheme-specific pensionable earnings cap
applicable to all members, set initially at  112,500 p.a. The scheme
specific cap of  112,500 is marginally higher than the pensions cap
applicable under current legislation (the Current Cap ). The Current
Cap is normally increased annually in line with price inflation and
would therefore have been expected to rise from the current figure 
of  105,600 to approximately  109,000 in 2006. This difference will
result in some 25 capped members, including Sir Peter Mason 
and Mr S J Siddall, receiving a small increase to the value of their
pension accrued to date.
The scheme design is aimed at achieving a benefit equivalent 
to the statutory Life Time Allowance over 20 years service for those
executives who have a 1/30ths accrual rate, which would include 
all participating executive directors, and 30 years for those with 
a 1/45ths accrual rate.
Non-bonusable salary supplements of 20 per cent in respect 
of basic salary in excess of the scheme-specific cap will be paid 
to all participating executive directors and may be paid selectively 
to other senior executives.
Participants will be able to opt-out of further pension accrual,
particularly if this would provide benefits in excess of the Life Time
Allowance, in which case they will receive a non-bonusable salary
supplement of 20 per cent of basic salary up to the scheme-specific
cap in lieu of further pension accrual. Where the supplement referred
to above in respect of the earnings cap was also being paid, this
would continue in addition.
62 AMEC plc annual report 2005
Directors' remuneration report
continued If individuals do accrue benefits in excess of the Life Time
Allowance, the payment of the additional tax liability will be 
the responsibility of the individual and not AMEC.
The company is paying for selected senior executives whose benefits
may exceed the Life Time Allowance, including Sir Peter Mason 
and Mr S J Siddall, to receive independent financial advice on the
implications of the new pensions tax regime, in particular whether
they should opt for primary and/or enhanced protection. This will 
be disclosed as a benefit in kind. 
Mr J A Monville is a member of the SPIE top-up scheme for senior
executives, which provides additional pension of up to 20 per cent 
of pensionable salary on top of the French compulsory social 
security and industry arrangements, subject to an aggregate limit 
of 50 per cent of pensionable pay at retirement. Due to French tax
rules, this additional pension does not vest until the point of retirement.
Mr Monville has a normal retirement age of 65. 
Employment related benefits, principally the provision of a company
car or car allowance, life assurance and private medical expenses
insurance, are also provided to executive directors.
Executive directors' employment contracts
AMEC's policy is that on appointment, executive directors will
normally be employed with a notice period of one year . In the event 
of employment being terminated with less notice than this, damages
will be determined at the time taking account of the circumstances
leading up to the termination and the individual's duty to mitigate 
his loss. 
Mr C A Riva who was appointed in August 2003 had a contract 
on this basis. This was terminated by the company from 31 July 2005,
following notice given on 11 April 2005.
Sir Peter Mason and Mr S J Siddall have employment contracts 
with notice periods of one year but with provision that if the company
terminates employment (other than for gross misconduct), rather
than receiving notice, the individual will be entitled to one year's
remuneration (less tax) as liquidated damages in full and final
settlement. For this purpose and, as a reasonable estimate of loss,
remuneration is defined as 1.75 times basic annual salary to take
account of salary, bonus potential, pension arrangements, the value
of benefits and compensation for loss of office. This recognises that
both of these individuals previously had notice periods of two years
which were reduced by agreement to one year from 1 January 2003
without compensation, following the change in policy on notice periods.
Mr J D Early had a similar arrangement up to his normal retirement
age on 8 November 2005, at which stage his employment contract
was amended by agreement to provide for three months' notice 
on either side.
Mr J A Monville is employed by SPIE S.A. as chairman. As a governing
executive (mandataire social) any compensation for loss of office 
is governed by his employment contract and French law. He is
entitled to three months' notice and a termination indemnity which,
at the end of 2005, would have been the equivalent of 10.5 months'
base salary plus bonus.
Service contracts for executive directors do not provide for extended
notice periods in the event of a change of control. It is not the
remuneration committee's intention to introduce such provisions.
External directorships
Executive directors are not permitted to accept external directorships
without the prior approval of the board. 
Sir Peter Mason is a non-executive director of BAE Systems plc. 
He retains the fee of  63,000 per annum which he receives in relation 
to this appointment.
Chairman
The remuneration committee is responsible for determining the
remuneration and other terms of employment of the chairman 
of the board. The contract of the chairman, Mr J M Green-Armytage,
contains provision for six months' written notice of resignation prior
to the expiry date and payment of six months' fees if the board
withdraw their agreement to his continuing to serve as chairman,
other than for gross misconduct. The chairman's current fee is  200,000
per annum and he is provided with life assurance cover of four times
the pensions earnings cap. 
Non-executive directors
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by 
the chairman and the executive directors under delegated authority 
from the board. The non-executive directors receive fees for their
services and do not participate in any of the incentive or benefit
schemes of the group. The fee structure was revised with effect 
from 1 January 2005.
The current fee is  40,000 per annum plus a further  5,000 per annum
in respect of chairing committees of the board other than audit,
where the additional fee is  10,000 per annum, and remuneration,
where the additional fee is  7,500 per annum. There is an additional
fee of  5,000 per annum paid to the senior independent director . 
Non-executive directors may also be paid additional fees for other
duties undertaken on behalf of the company. In 2005, Ms E P Airey
received  10,000 for chairing the trustee boards of the main UK
pension schemes. She resigned from that role on 1 March 2006 
and was replaced by an independent trustee chairman. Ms M O Hesse
received US$10,000 for chairing the North America advisory board. 
The board's policy is that non-executive director appointments 
are normally for three consecutive three year terms, subject 
to review after the end of each term. The non-executive directors 
as at 31 December 2005 have fixed term contracts which run until
the dates set out below:
Date of contract Service review date
E P Airey 26 May 1999 25 May 2008
J A Dallas 28 October 1999 27 October 2008
M O Hesse 1 June 2000 31 May 2006
J-P Jacamon 27 November 2002 27 November 2008
P J Byrom 10 February 2005 9 February 2008
T W Faithfull 10 February 2005 9 February 2008
The contracts of non-executive directors may be terminated by 
the individual at any time and there are no specific provisions for
compensation in the event of early termination by the company.
In accordance with the articles of association of AMEC, all directors
are required to seek re-election by shareholders every three years.

Notes
(i) Sir Peter Mason, Mr Siddall and Mr Riva received a taxable supplement of 20 per cent of salary above the pension earnings cap. 
Mr Early has received a supplement of 20 per cent of total salary since 1 November 2005 in lieu of further pension accrual.
(ii) The bonuses detailed above represented the following percentages of their base salaries for the year against a maximum potential of
80 per cent: Sir Peter Mason 23.0 per cent, Mr Early 35.4 per cent, Mr Monville 41.6 per cent and Mr Siddall 30.0 per cent. No bonus 
has been paid this year in respect of AMEC plc profit performance. The awards made reflect varying achievement against other specific
business targets and personal objectives. 
(iii) The value of benefits in kind received during the year relates principally to the provision of a company car or car allowance, travelling
expenses and private medical expenses insurance. Unemployment insurance is also made available to Mr Monville in accordance with
French practice. During 2004, Mr Riva received relocation expenses of  255,000 relating to when he originally joined AMEC. None of these
benefits are pensionable. 
(iv) Mr Monville's salary comprised  503,000 paid by SPIE S.A. and  30,000 paid by AMEC plc.
(v) Mr Riva received a compensation payment of  571,000 under the terms of a compromise agreement, reached through negotiations with 
Mr Riva and his legal advisers, in lieu of the balance of his notice and as compensation for loss of office, with a reduction to take account 
of mitigation. In addition, all Mr Riva's share option and performance share awards lapsed on leaving.

Notes
The additional awards made in September 2005 were to give effect to the policy approved by the 2005 annual general meeting to increase
performance share awards and to cease annual option awards. The timing of the awards was delayed due to close period restrictions.
For the performance share awards made in April 2002, AMEC failed to meet the minimum performance conditions and, therefore, 
the awards lapsed in April 2005.
The terms and conditions of the Performance Share Plan have not been varied during the year other than in the composition of the
comparator group for 2005 awards compared to those for previous years' awards. This change reflects the changed FTSE sector listing 
of the company's shares from Construction and Building Materials to Support Services. 
The closing price of the shares at 31 December 2005 was 343.50 pence (2004: 297.75 pence).
The range of the closing prices for the shares during the year was 300.00 pence to 372.00 pence.
The register of directors' interests, which is open to inspection at the company's registered office, contains full details of directors'
shareholdings, share options and awards under the Performance Share Plan.
Had the restricted shares detailed above vested in full as at 31 December 2005 the approximate latent value before appropriate 
taxes for each of the current directors would have been: Sir Peter Mason,  2,670,000; Mr Early,  942,000; Mr Siddall,  1,425,000; 
and Mr Monville,  1,377,000. These hypothetical figures assume that all performance conditions would have been fully met, which 
in practice may not transpire.

(iv) Remaining awards made under the former Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 and not exercised during the year were capable 
of being exercised at 31 December 2005. If these options had been exercised on that date the approximate gain before appropriate 
taxes for Sir Peter Mason would have been  901,000.
(v) Had the remainder of the options been capable of being exercised and vested in full as at 31 December 2005, the approximate latent gain
before appropriate taxes for each of the current directors would have been: Sir Peter Mason,  454,000; Mr Early,  214,000; Mr Siddall,
 257,000; and Mr Monville,  116,000. These hypothetical figures assume that all performance conditions would have been fully met, 
which in practice may not transpire.
(vi) There were no grants under the Executive Share Option Scheme during the year .

(ii) Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with version 8.1 of guidance note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession.
(iii) The value of net increase represents the incremental value to the director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption
service terminated at the year end. It is based on the accrued pension increase after deducting the director's contribution. Note that 
Mr Riva's pensionable service ended on 31 July 2005 and Mr Early's pensionable service ended on 31 October 2005.
(iv) The change in the transfer value includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the company

(v) Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
Mr J A Monville is a member of the SPIE top-up pension scheme for senior executives. Although the scheme, arranged through an insurance
company, is a defined benefit scheme, it is not possible to disclose his pension benefits in the above format. A pension is payable by SPIE only 
in the event of Mr Monville reaching his normal retirement age of 65 or, following the attainment of age 60, by agreement with AMEC. No pension
is due or payable in other circumstances and Mr Monville currently has no accrued right to a pension payment. His pension at the normal
retirement age, or as agreed by AMEC, would be based on the average of his last three years' base salary and bonus, up to a maximum of 
20 per cent of this figure. As at 31 December 2005, this would equate to  110,000 ( 160,000 (2004:  106,000 ( 149,000)) per annum. It is not
possible to attribute a value to the accrued funds as these are not separately identified by the insurance company.
