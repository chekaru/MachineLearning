n  medium and long-term incentives which align the interests  
of shareholders and senior executives by offering the latter  
the opportunity to accumulate significant capital over a period  
but only if stretching shareholder value targets are met; 
n  whilst accepting that within this policy there will be occasions  
when higher or lower levels of remuneration will be appropriate  
in particular circumstances. 
Executive directors' base salaries and annual bonuses 
The base salaries of executive directors are reviewed annually, having 
regard to personal performance, company performance, competitive 
market practice as determined by external research and pay levels 
more broadly within the company. The following salaries have been 
approved from 1 January 2007, representing an annualised increase  
of no more than 4 per cent: 
S Y Brikho  656,500
J D Early  300,116
S J Siddall  393,120
All executive directors participate in the AMEC executive annual bonus 
plan which generates bonus payments calculated by reference to each 
of the following: 
n   the profit achievement of the group, with a target level of bonus 
payable for achieving budget and the maximum pay-out requiring 
achievement of a more stretching target;
n  the achievement of other specific business targets, including  
cash flow and, where relevant, divisional profit; and 
n  individual performance objectives (for example, in relation to safety, 
strategy, business development and organisational issues). In 2007, 
the achievement of the STEP Change plan will be the main or only 
objective for executives.
A separate amount of bonus attaches to each of these components. 
The proportions vary between individuals depending on their specific 
executive roles. The maximum potential annual bonus is 125 per cent 
of base salary for the chief executive and normally 80 per cent for other 
executive directors. In every case, the profit and other business target 
components represent more than half of the potential total. 
In order to recruit the new chief executive, it was necessary to 
guarantee, as part of his joining arrangements, a minimum bonus for 
the first twelve months of his employment. The guarantee for the part 
of 2006 after his joining is set out in note (ii) of the table on page 63.  
For 2007, the guarantee is 62.5 per cent of his salary earned in the 
first nine months of the year . 
Reflecting the planned sale of the Built Environment business,  
Mr Early's 2007 bonus payment will reflect the achievement of the 
disposals in terms acceptable to the board, the price achieved and 
performance of the constituent businesses up to disposal. In certain 
circumstances, the level of 80 per cent of his rate of salary for the year 
may be exceeded.
In the senior management group, no executive has a base salary  
or total remuneration higher than any executive director . 
Executive directors' long-term incentives 
AMEC's principal long-term incentive arrangement is the 
Performance Share Plan 2002 (PSP ). AMEC's policy is to make annual 
awards to executive directors, and to a small number of other senior 
executives just below board level, of restricted shares with a value  
at the time of award of up to 175 per cent of base salary. In addition, 
participants are offered a further award, up to a maximum of 25 per cent 
of base salary, of five restricted shares for every three acquired by the 
executives, generally purchased from their previous year's post-tax 
bonus and held on their behalf as investment shares for the full three 
year performance period. Awards are also made to a wider group, 
with lower levels of face value to reflect seniority and contribution. 
Directors' remuneration 
report
This report covers the remuneration of executive and non-executive 
directors and related matters, including long-term incentive awards. 
Remuneration committee membership and advisers 
During the year, the members of the remuneration committee 
comprised Mr J A Dallas (chairman up to 24 August 2006),  
Mr T W Faithfull (chairman from 25 August 2006), Ms E P Airey,  
Ms M O Hesse (until 5 December 2006), Mr P J Byrom (until 5 
December 2006) and Mr J-P Jacamon (until his resignation as a 
director on 31 August 2006). The quorum was reduced from three  
to two members with effect from 5 December 2006. The chairman  
of the board, Mr J M Green-Armytage, attends meetings by invitation 
but is not a member of the remuneration committee. The committee's 
terms of reference can be found under corporate governance  on 
www.amec.com or on request from the company secretary. 
In considering the matters within its remit, the committee takes 
account of recommendations from the chairman in respect of  
the chief executive and from the chief executive in respect of other 
executives and is advised by the group human resources director . 
During 2006, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (New Bridge 
Street ) continued to provide standing advice to the committee  
in connection with its responsibilities. New Bridge Street does  
not carry out material additional work for the company. The terms  
of engagement between the company and New Bridge Street  
are available from the company secretary. 
Remuneration policy 
The objective of the remuneration policy, in respect of the executive 
directors and other senior executives, is to offer remuneration 
packages that are competitive in the markets in which the executives 
are based and which: 
n  allow AMEC to attract and retain senior executives of high  
calibre; and
n  incentivise senior executives to achieve superior short-term 
performance and increase the medium and long-term value  
of AMEC for its shareholders and encourage executives to build  
and retain a significant shareholding in AMEC. 
More specifically, the policy is to set: 
n  base salaries which broadly equate to the mid-market salary 
practices of a relevant group of support services, engineering  
and construction comparator companies and other companies 
regarded as comparable by virtue of, amongst other factors, 
revenue, employee numbers, market capitalisation and/or 
geographic coverage;
n  annual bonuses which incentivise the achievement of stretching 
business and individual performance targets and offer the 
opportunity to achieve upper quartile annual cash earnings if these 
targets are achieved;

4155 AMEC_mid_06.indd   60 4/4/07   10:58:10 These restricted shares will only vest if pre-determined performance 
conditions are met. For awards made up to and including 2006, the 
requirement for full vesting is for AMEC to be ranked in the top 
quartile of total shareholder return, measured over a three year 
period, of a comparator group. This currently comprises the 
companies that, at the time of grant of each award, are in the FTSE 
Business Support Services, Heavy Construction and Oil Equipment 
and Services sub-sectors, and whose market capitalisations lie in a 
range (as may be agreed from time to time) spanning that of AMEC. 
For the 2006 awards, the range was  350 million to  3,200 million and 
comprised 33 companies including AMEC. If AMEC's performance is at 
the median, 25 per cent of the award will vest. 100 per cent of the 
award will vest at upper quartile. Between the median and the upper 
quartile, the award will vest on a straight-line basis. No awards will 
vest if AMEC's performance is below median. However, to ensure that 
AMEC's underlying performance is properly reflected, no awards will 
vest if AMEC's earnings per share have grown by less than the rate of 
inflation plus six percentage points over the three year period. 
For the awards made in 2006 and subsequently, the definition  
of earnings per share has been changed to reflect underlying 
performance more accurately in the light of the new International 
Financial Reporting Standards.
Lists of the comparator companies for the awards that lapsed during 
the year and those awards currently subsisting can be obtained on 
request from the company secretary. 
Awards are normally made in April following the publication of the 
annual result. In 2006, awards were delayed because of the sale of 
AMEC SPIE until September, following the publication of the interim 
results. It is intended to revert to the normal pattern of April awards 
for 2007 and subsequent years. 
Following the new chief executive's strategic review of the business, 
the remuneration committee has decided that the performance targets 
attached to PSP awards should be modified for grants made in 2007 
and future years to create an incentive for executives to deliver the 
strategic plan and to improve the line of sight between performance 
and award. In particular, earnings per share should play a greater role 
in determining the level of vesting of future PSP awards to reflect the 
objective of increasing operating margins.
Accordingly, the remuneration committee will apply the existing total 
shareholder return condition to 50 per cent of a future award. No 
awards will vest under this part unless there has been sustained 
financial growth of the company. The other 50 per cent will be subject 
to an earnings per share growth target. The intended policy is that  
the vesting range will be RPI plus 3 per cent per annum (25 per cent  
of that part of the award vests) to RPI plus 10 per cent per annum  
(100 per cent of that award vests). 
However, for the 2007 awards, taking account of the plans that are being 
implemented to improve the margins and reduce overheads in the ongoing 
business, applying this RPI plus 3 to 10 per cent earnings per share  
growth range is not considered to be sufficiently stretching. Consequently, 
the earnings per share required in 2009 for maximum vesting of the 
relevant portion of these 2007 awards will be 38 pence and the level at 
which 25 per cent of this portion of the award will vest will be 26 pence.
Earnings per share will be calculated on a consistent and normalised 
basis by the remuneration committee, having sought appropriate 
external advice on the method of calculation and any adjusting and 
potentially adjusting items. 
The remuneration committee also ensures that, for any performance 
conditions affected by the transition to International Financial Reporting 
Standards, measurement for remuneration purposes will be, as far  
as practicable, consistent year on year . Performance against the total 
shareholder return targets is calculated independently and reviewed 
by the remuneration committee.
The company has a second scheme in place - the Executive Share 
Option Scheme 2002. AMEC's policy is to grant share options under  
this scheme only selectively and in exceptional circumstances such as 
recruitment. No awards have been made under this scheme since 2004. 
In addition, executive directors may participate in relevant all 
employee share plans which provide options, without performance 
conditions, related to savings contracts with an aggregate limit  
of  250 savings per month. 
The AMEC Performance Share Plan 2006
On 2 October 2006, Mr S Y Brikho was awarded 785,712 restricted 
shares in AMEC plc under the AMEC Performance Share Plan 2006 
(Recruitment Plan ) which was adopted in October 2006 specifically 
to facilitate the recruitment of Mr Brikho as chief executive of AMEC 
plc on 1 October 2006. The terms of the awards generally mirror those 
under the Performance Share Plan 2002, which was approved by 
shareholders in May 2002. The award consists of two distinct 
elements; Part A and Part B:
n  Part A is in respect of 241,019 shares and will vest in three tranches 
on 8 December 2006, 10 December 2007 and 3 February 2009 
respectively, subject to continued service but no other vesting 
conditions. This element of the award is designed to compensate  
Mr Brikho for the value of the share incentives he held with his 
previous employer, which lapsed or were forfeit on cessation.
n  Part B is in respect of 544,693 shares and will vest subject to the 
satisfaction of the same performance conditions applying to the awards 
made in 2006 under the 2002 plan, which are described above. 
No further awards may be made to Mr Brikho under the Recruitment 
Plan and no new issue shares or treasury shares will be used  
to satisfy the award.
The award will normally lapse if Mr Brikho leaves AMEC before  
it vests, except where he leaves for certain specified reasons including 
disability, injury, death, ill health, redundancy and retirement. On  
a change in control the award will vest under Part A in total and under 
Part B to the extent that the performance conditions are satisfied.
The number and/or nominal amount of shares may be adjusted by  
the board on certain variations in AMEC's share capital and the board 
may require written agreement of any such adjustment by the auditors.
The awards are not pensionable and are not transferable.
Share Ownership Guidelines
It is intended to introduce during 2007, guidelines requiring executive 
directors to build up over a three year period and retain a holding of 
AMEC shares received from incentive plans. A level of one times 
salary is being targeted for executive directors with lower levels for 
less senior executives.
Executive directors' pension entitlements and benefits 
The executive directors, except for Mr J D Early, are members of  
the AMEC Staff Pension Scheme and have top-up benefits provided 
through the AMEC Executive Pension Scheme. The schemes are both 
defined benefit schemes registered with HMRC and also provide for life 
assurance cover and dependants' pensions. These executive directors 
accrue pension rights which are linked to the length of pensionable 
service and to final pensionable salary and have a normal pension age 
of 60. However executive directors who remain in employment beyond 
60 are able to continue to accrue further pension rights. 
The company is currently consulting with members and trustees  
of the Staff and Executive Pension Schemes over proposals to move 
from final salary to career average revalued earnings (CARE )  
in respect of benefits accrued from 1 January 2008 onwards.
The benefits of Mr Brikho and Mr S J Siddall are restricted to a 
scheme earnings cap which is set at  112,500 for the 2006/7 tax year 
( 120,000 for 2007/8) and they receive a taxable supplement to their 
 Directors' remuneration report AMEC plc annual report 2006 61
4155 AMEC_mid_06.indd   61 4/4/07   10:58:11  www.amec.com
salaries in relation to earnings above the cap. Mr Brikho also has the 
benefit of additional life assurance in respect of earnings above the 
cap. There are no unregistered pension arrangements in force for 
executive directors. 
Executive directors are able to opt-out of further pension accrual, 
particularly if this would provide benefits in excess of the Life Time 
Allowance, in which case they will receive a non-bonusable salary 
supplement of 20 per cent of basic salary in lieu of further pension 
accrual. This applies to Mr Early who ceased to be a member of the 
AMEC Staff and Executive Pension Schemes on 31 October 2005 and 
consequently is not accruing further benefits under either scheme.
If individuals do accrue benefits in excess of the Life Time Allowance, 
the payment of the associated tax liability will be the responsibility  
of the individual and not AMEC. 
Employment related benefits, principally the provision of a company 
car or car allowance, long-term disability and private medical 
expenses insurance, are also provided to executive directors.  
Mr Brikho also receives a temporary accommodation allowance  
that reduces over his first three years of employment.
Executive directors' employment contracts 
AMEC's policy is that on appointment, executive directors will 
normally be employed with a notice period of one year . In the event  
of employment being terminated with less notice than this, damages 
will be determined at the time taking account of the circumstances 
leading up to the termination and the individual's duty to mitigate  
his loss. Executive directors are required to give six months' notice  
of resignation. Since 1 October 2006, executive directors have  
a contractual retirement age of 65.
Mr Brikho was employed initially with a notice period of two years  
from the company, reducing by one month each month during the first 
year of employment to one year after the first year of employment.  
On the part of Mr Brikho, the notice period was initially set at one year, 
reducing progressively to six months after the first year of employment.
Mr Siddall has an employment contract with a notice period of one 
year but with provision that if the company terminates employment 
(other than for gross misconduct), rather than receiving notice, he will  
be entitled to one year's remuneration (less tax) as liquidated damages 
in full and final settlement. For this purpose and, as a reasonable 
estimate of loss, remuneration is defined as 1.75 times basic  
annual salary to take account of salary, bonus potential, pension 
arrangements, the value of benefits and compensation for loss  
of office. This recognises that he previously had a notice period  
of two years which was reduced by agreement to one year from  
1 January 2003 without compensation, following the change  
in policy on notice periods.
Mr Early has a contract which terminates on 31 December 2007.  
It may be terminated earlier than this by Mr Early giving six months' 
notice of resignation.
Service contracts for executive directors do not provide for extended 
notice periods in the event of a change of control. It is not the 
remuneration committee's intention to introduce such provisions.
External directorships 
Executive directors are not permitted to accept external directorships 
without the prior approval of the board. 
Mr Early is a director of G-Mex Limited for which he receives  
no remuneration.
For the period during the year when he was a director of AMEC,  
Sir Peter Mason was a non-executive director of BAE Systems plc.  
He retained the fee of  73,000 per annum which he received in relation  
to this appointment.
Chairman
The remuneration committee is responsible for determining  
the remuneration and other terms of employment of the chairman  
of the board. The contract of the chairman, Mr Green-Armytage,  
runs to 20 January 2008. It may be terminated earlier than this on six 
months' written notice of resignation or with payment of six months' 
fees if the board withdraw their agreement to his continuing to serve 
as chairman, other than for gross misconduct. The chairman's current 
fee is  200,000 per annum and he is provided with life assurance cover  
of four times the pensions earnings cap. 
Non-executive directors 
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the 
chairman and the executive directors under delegated authority from 
the board. The non-executive directors receive fees for their services 
and do not participate in any of the incentive or benefit schemes  
of the group. Fees were reviewed with effect from 1 January 2007.
The current fee is  47,500 per annum plus a further  5,000 per 
annum in respect of chairing committees of the board other than  
the audit committee, where the additional fee is  12,500 per annum, 
and the remuneration committee, where the additional fee is  
 7,500 per annum. There is an additional fee of  7,500 per annum  
paid to the senior independent director . The policy with regard  
to fee structure is to reflect time commitment and responsibility  
of the various roles.
Non-executive directors may also be paid additional fees for other 
duties undertaken on behalf of the company. 
The board's policy is that non-executive director appointments  
are normally for three consecutive three year terms, subject to  
review after the end of each term. The non-executive directors  
as at 31 December 2006 have fixed-term contracts which run  
until the dates set out below: 
  Date of contract Service review date
E P Airey 26 May 1999 25 May 2008

P J Byrom 10 February 2005 9 February 2008
T W Faithfull 10 February 2005 9 February 2008
The contracts of non-executive directors may be terminated by  
the individual at any time and there are no specific provisions for 
compensation in the event of early termination by the company. 
In accordance with the articles of association of AMEC, all directors 
are required to seek re-election by shareholders every three years. 
 * Mr Dallas will be standing down as a non-executive director at the 
conclusion of the annual general meeting on 16 May 2007.

Notes 
(i)  Sir Peter Mason, Mr Siddall and Mr Brikho received a taxable supplement of 20 per cent of salary above the pension earnings cap.  
Mr Early has received a supplement of 20 per cent of total salary in lieu of further pension accrual. 
(ii)  The bonuses detailed above represented the following percentages of their base salaries for the year against a maximum potential of  
80 per cent: Sir Peter Mason 20 per cent, Mr Early 21.2 per cent and Mr Siddall 36 per cent. (Sir Peter Mason's bonus is calculated on base 
salary for the 10 months of the year that he worked, including October when he was no longer a director .) No bonus has been paid this year 
in respect of the AMEC plc profit element which was below the threshold target. The awards made reflect varying degrees of achievement 
against other specific business targets and personal objectives (which included AMEC plc cash flow, the SPIE disposal and the strategic 
review in the case of Sir Peter and Mr Siddall, and profit and cash flow of the Investments business in the case of Mr Early). 
 As outlined in last year's report, the figure for Mr J A Monville relates to a special incentive geared to both the proceeds of the sale of AMEC 
SPIE, which exceeded original expectations, and the maintaining of budgeted financial performance up to the point of sale. This replaced 
his normal annual bonus for the year . Mr Brikho's bonus represented the maximum 125 per cent of base salary for the three months of  
the year after joining AMEC, reflecting his excellent performance since his appointment. As part of his joining arrangements, he had been 
guaranteed a minimum payment of 75 per cent of this maximum for the balance of 2006. 
(iii)  The value of benefits in kind received during the year relates principally to the provision of a company car or car allowance, travelling 
expenses and private medical expenses insurance. Unemployment insurance was also made available to Mr Monville in accordance  
with French practice. 
(iv) As a one-off arrangement, non-executive directors other than the chairman each received additional fees of  20,000 to recognise the 
exceptional time commitment resulting from the company's strategic review and sale of SPIE. Ms Airey received  1,667 for chairing  
the trustee boards of the main UK pension schemes up to 1 March 2006. Ms Hesse received US$ 10,000 for chairing the North America 
Advisory Board.

Notes 
(i)  For the performance share awards made in April 2003, AMEC failed to meet the minimum performance conditions and, therefore, the 
awards lapsed in April 2006.
(ii)  A proportion of Sir Peter Mason's performance share awards lapsed on his retirement to take account of the unexpired portions of the 
relevant performance periods. The performance conditions relating to Mr Monville's share awards were tested at the time of leaving.  
The minimum conditions were considered not to have been met and as a result the awards lapsed.
(iii)  The awards made to Mr Brikho under the Recruitment Plan that vest in Dec 2006, Dec 2007 and Feb 2009 are not subject to performance 
conditions. These replaced share awards made by his former employer which were forfeit on joining AMEC.
(iv)  The first portion of Mr Brikho's award under the Recruitment Plan vested on 8 December 2006 at a vesting price of 415.5 pence, being  
the closing market price for the previous day.
(v)  The terms and conditions of the Performance Share Plan 2002 have not been varied during the year .
(vi)  The closing price of the shares at 31 December 2006 was 421.50 pence (2005: 343.50 pence).
(vii)  The range of the closing prices for the shares during the year was 271.25 pence to 439.50 pence.
(viii)  The register of directors' interests, which is open to inspection at the company's registered office, contains full details of directors' 
shareholdings, share options and awards under the performance share plans. 
(ix)  Had the restricted shares detailed above vested in full as at 31 December 2006 the approximate latent value before appropriate taxes for 
each of the current directors would have been: Mr Brikho,  2,933,000; Mr Early,  1,352,000 and Mr Siddall,  2,079,000. These hypothetical 
figures assume that all performance conditions would have been fully met, which in practice may not transpire.

Notes 
(i)  Gain on exercise  1,153,296 (2005:  1,362,000).
(ii)   All awards under the Executive Share Option Scheme 2002 are subject to performance conditions which require a minimum level of 
earnings per share growth for any vesting and a higher level of growth for full vesting. The minimum performance condition which applies 
to the awards made in 2002 was not met at the second time of testing. These awards are subject to a further retest in 2007. The minimum 
performance condition which applies to the awards made in 2003 was not met at the first time of testing. These awards are subject  
to further retests in 2007 and 2008. Executive Share Option Scheme awards made from 2004 onwards are not subject to retest.
(iii)   A proportion of Sir Peter Mason's award made in 2004 lapsed on his retirement to take account of the unexpired portion of the performance 
period. The performance conditions relating to Mr Monville's options were tested at the time of leaving. The minimum conditions were 
considered not to have been met and as a result the awards lapsed. 
(iv)   Had the options been capable of being exercised and vested in full as at 31 December 2006, the approximate latent gain before appropriate 
taxes for each of the current directors would have been: Mr Early,  434,000 and Mr Siddall,  528,000. These hypothetical figures assume 
that all performance conditions would have been fully met, which in practice may not transpire.
(v)   The terms and conditions of the Option Schemes have not been varied during the year and all subsisting awards were made at nil cost.

Notes 
(i) Pension accruals shown are the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year .
(ii) Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with version 8.1 of guidance note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession.
(iii)  The value of net increase represents the incremental value to the director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption 
service terminated at the year end. It is based on the accrued pension increase after deducting the director's contribution.
(iv)  The change in the transfer value includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the company 
and directors, such as stockmarket movements. It is calculated after deducting the director's contribution.
(v)  Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
(vi)  Sir Peter Mason retired on 31 October 2006 and elected to take a lump sum of  178,803 and residual pension of  28,987 per annum.  
The figures in the table include allowance for these amounts. If allowance for the lump sum is excluded, in accordance with Companies  
Act Regulations, the year end value reduces to  655,540. The change in value during the period also reduces by the same amount, such 
that the transfer value at the end of the period is actually  96,053 less than the transfer value at the beginning.
