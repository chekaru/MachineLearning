 Chairman's Statement
Summary of results
I am pleased to be able to report that your Group has achieved a  
satisfactory result for the year 2004 despite unfavourable weather 
conditions. Compared with 2003 the Group's profit on ordinary activities 
before tax and exceptional charges was  12.4m, compared with  14.0m 
last year (PBT  14.6m less  0.6m exceptional credits). This is reduced to 
 7.2m after charging exceptional items of  4.9m for the cash cancellation 
of employee share options and  0.3m lease provisions on the disposal of 
Cox Plant. Profit after tax amounted to  4.9m. Consequently the adjusted 
diluted earnings per share decreased from 15.3 pence to 14.2 pence  
but the basic earnings per share reduced further from 16.8 pence to  
8.5 pence due to the effect of the exceptional items noted above. 
2004 was a year of consolidation, reflecting a hiatus in the UK market 
place, exacerbated by an unusual combination of weather conditions: a 
warm winter, an extended period of low water tables caused by a year of 
low rainfall, and a cool summer. We continue to focus on controlling costs 
and re-aligning the cost base towards selling activity in order to be able to 
take advantage of any trading opportunities that become available.
Despite the exceptional cash outflows of  4.9m for the cancellation  
of the employee share options and  0.6m attributable to purchase  
of own shares, net debt reduced from  4.7m last year to  2.9m at  
31 December 2004.
I consider the Group has performed satisfactorily in a difficult trading 
environment and is well placed to compete in a competitive market sector.

Overview of continuing operations
Turnover from the continuing operations decreased from  68.3m to  62.7m 
and operating profit before exceptional items from  14.4m to  12.5m in 2004 
(operating profit of  7.6m add back  4.9m exceptional cost). The downturn 
affected the UK core businesses especially Hire whose turnover decreased from 
 38.9m to  36.5m. The operating profit of our main UK  businesses fell from  
 11.5m to  10.1m. Although all product ranges were affected due to adverse 
weather conditions, the lack of prolonged summer conditions in 2004 compared  
to the record temperatures of 2003 meant  air conditioning was especially affected. Chairman's Statement

(operating profit of  7.6m add back  4.9m exceptional cost). The downturn

weather conditions, the lack of prolonged summer conditions in 2004 compared  
to the record temperatures of 2003 meant  air conditioning was especially affected. Chairman's Statement
The UK fixed air conditioning company, Andrews Air Conditioning and 
Refrigeration, achieved an operating profit of  0.6m compared to  0.7m in 
the previous year. Although turnover decreased by  0.7m margins improved 
and the value of gross margin was maintained. 
Despite a  1.6m decrease in turnover, Accommodation Hire, our subsidiary 
that specialises in the hire of temporary accommodation units and toilet 
facilities, achieved an operating profit of a similar level to that in 2003. 
Engineering Appliances, the specialist heating and ventilation business, saw 
turnover fall by  0.9m from  3.8m to  2.9m.
The Group's well established heating and air conditioning business in The 
Netherlands had a successful year achieving an operating profit of  1.1m 
compared to  0.9m last year. Similarly our operation in the Middle East, 
Khansaheb Sykes LLC, increased its profits to  0.4m from  0.3m last year.
I remain confident that our strategy of continuing to concentrate upon 
developing the UK specialist hire and rental market by organic growth 
supplemented by niche market acquisitions offers opportunity for further 
profit growth and added shareholder value. 
Earnings  per share and buy back programme
As set out in the Note 9 of the Financial Statements, the adjusted diluted 
earnings per share excluding exceptional items is 14.2 pence compared with 
15.3 pence last year. Basic earnings per share was 8.5 pence compared with 
16.8 pence last year.
The Board continues to believe that shareholder value will be optimised by the 
purchase, when appropriate, of our own shares coupled with investment in 
organic growth. Consequently, the Board will request that shareholders vote in 
favour of a resolution to renew the authority to purchase up to 12.5% of the 
ordinary shares in issue.

Dividend
As reported in my interim statement, the Board declared an interim dividend of 1.0 pence 
per ordinary share in respect of the year ended 31 December 2004 and this was paid on 
4 November 2004. The Board is now pleased to propose a final special dividend of 14.0 
pence per share, to return surplus cash to shareholders. This will be paid on 15 June 2005 to 
shareholders on the register on 13 May 2005.
Outlook 
Expectations for the first quarter are broadly similar to the last quarter of 2004. With costs 
under control the business is well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities as 
they arise. I would therefore expect the Group to achieve a better year in 2005.
