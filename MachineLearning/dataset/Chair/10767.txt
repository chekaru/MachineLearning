OVERVIEW AND FINANCIAL 
HIGHLIGHTS
The group's revenue for the year ended 31 December 2011 was 
 53.8 million, a decrease of  2.1 million, or 3.8%, compared with 
the same period last year. This decrease had a virtually direct 
impact on normalised operating profit* which fell by  2.0 million 
from  13.9 million last year to  11.9 million in the year under review. 
This decline in trading was, however, more than offset by the non-
recurring profit of  3.1 million on the sale of our freehold property 
in Gallions Road, London. Consequently the basic earnings per 
share increased by 11.8% from 24.19p last year to 27 .05p this year .
The group continues to generate strong cash flows. Net cash inflow 
from operating activities was  11.6 million which, mainly due to the 
decline in normalised operating profit*, was down by  2.3 million 
compared with last year. Nevertheless, net funds increased from 
 4.9 million last year to  10.4 million at 31 December 2011 despite 
shareholder related cash outflows of  3.9 million on dividends and 
the purchase of own shares. External bank borrowings have been 
reduced by  6 million from  20 million at the start of the year to 
 14 million by the year-end. 
Cost control, cash and working capital management continue to be 
priorities for the group. In total working capital has been reduced 
for the third year running, this time by  0.5 million. Capital 
expenditure on the hire fleet has been increased from  2.2 million 
in 2010 to  4.1 million this year and the group purchased a freehold 
property for  2.7 million to replace the property sold during the 
year . These actions will ensure that the group's infrastructure and 
revenue generating assets are sufficient to support future growth 
and profitability. Hire fleet utilisation, condition and availability 
continue to be the subjects of management focus.
OPERATING PERFORMANCE
The second half year is normally significantly more profitable 
than the first but 2011 proved to be an exception. The following 
table splits the results between the first and second half years:
Turnover
 '000
Normalised
Operating
profit*
 '000
1st half 2011 27,717 5,930
1st half 2010 27,573 6,816
2nd half 2011 26,121 5,952
2nd half 2010 28,378 7,126
Total 2011 53,838 11,882
Total 2010 55,951 13,942
Our main hire and sales business in the UK and Northern Europe 
has faced challenging trading conditions throughout 2011 mainly 
as a result of unhelpful weather conditions but also due to the 
current economic conditions.
Trading in the first half remained flat and profit was adversely 
affected by the temperate weather at the end of the 2010/11 winter 
which resulted in an early end to the heating season. This was 
followed by another mild summer that failed to stimulate demand 
for our all important air conditioning products. Unlike last year, 
the start of the 2011/12 winter was also mild which did not allow 
our heating division to compensate for the under-performance 
of the air conditioning business. The last 18 months have also 
been unusually dry resulting in the drought conditions recently 
announced for some parts of the UK. Overall the operating profit, 
excluding profit on the sale of property, of this business segment 
fell from  13.8 million last year to  12.0 million this year, this 
being the main reason for the decline in the group's normalised 
operating profit* in the current period.
* Operating profit before non-recurring items as reconciled on the Consolidated Income Statement.

In the light of the above factors I consider that management's 
performance has been creditable ensuring that the group 
produced another satisfactory trading performance. This clearly 
demonstrates our ability to return acceptable profit levels even in 
times of unfavourable external influence and is due, in part, to the 
continuing development of non-weather dependent niche markets 
which continue to benefit the performance of our specialist 
hire divisions. We will continue to invest in and develop these 
businesses as well as our traditional core products and services.
Our hire and sales business in the Middle East returned an 
operating profit of  0.6 million this year compared with  0.7 
million in 2010 on similar turnover levels. Although the profit is 
lower than last year there are now some initial signs of improved 
trading conditions in Abu Dhabi although the economic conditions 
in Dubai remain challenging. 
The UK fixed installation business continued to improve its trading 
performance, the segment profit increased by  0.1 million to  0.3 
million this year and we look forward to further improvements 
again next year.
A more detailed review of this year's operating performance is 
given in the Operations Review within the Directors' Report.
PROFIT ON THE SALE OF PROPERTY
During the year the group sold the freehold of one of its main UK 
depots, based in Gallions Road, London, to a property developer. 
Gross proceeds were  3.7 million resulting in a profit on disposal 
of  3.1 million and this has been disclosed as a separate non-
recurring item on the face of the income statement.
Although the group was not actively looking for a sale, management 
took advantage of a unique opportunity to realise a significant 
profit and cash flow advantage for the benefit of shareholders. 
The group purchased a replacement freehold property locally in 
Peninsular Way for  2.7 million and expect the relocation to the 
new premises to be completed by the end of the first half of 2012. 
Part of the net cash inflow of  1 million will be spent on capital 
improvements in 2012 following which the group will have a much 
improved and enlarged operating base from which to serve its 
customers in London and the South East of England. 
PROFIT FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 
AND EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)
Profit after tax increased by  1 million from  10.6 million last 
year to  11.6 million this year and basic EPS increased by 11.8% 
from 24.19p last year to 27.05p this year. However this was 
significantly influenced by the above profit on sale of property of 
 3.1 million. The adjusted basic EPS, excluding the profit on the 
sale of property, would have been 20.24p in 2011, a decrease of 
15% compared with the equivalent figure last year of 23.81p.
A more detailed review of the profit for the financial year is given 
in the Operations and Financial Review within the Directors' 
Report.
DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION SCHEME
During March 2012 the December 2010 funding valuation was 
agreed by management with the pension scheme trustees and 
accordingly revised Schedule of Contributions  and Recovery 
plan  have now been put into place. These provide that the group 
will make additional contributions, including an expense allowance, 
to the pension scheme of  840,000 in 2012,  960,000 in 2013, 
 1,080,000 in 2014 and  840,000 per annum thereafter until  
31 December 2018, or until the funding shortfall has been 
eliminated if sooner, subject to review at the next actuarial 
funding valuation due as at 31 December 2013.
NET FUNDS
At 31 December 2011 the group had net funds of  10.4 million 
compared with  4.9 million last year, an increase of  5.5 million 
despite a dividend of  2.8 million and cash outflows on share 
buybacks of  1.1 million.

OVERVIEW AND
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
EQUITY DIVIDENDS PAID
The company declared an interim dividend of  2.8 million on  
8 November 2011 and this was paid on 1 December 2011. The board 
continues the policy of returning value to shareholders whenever 
possible and accordingly the decision regarding an interim 
dividend for 2012 will be taken later in the year in the light of 
profitability and available cash resources.
SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAMME
During the current year the company purchased 442,216 ordinary 
shares for cancellation for a total consideration of  945,000 of 
which  11,000 (2010:  187,000) remained unpaid at the year-
end. So far during 2012 the company has purchased a further 
426,506 ordinary shares for cancellation for a total consideration 
of  815,000. These purchases enhanced earnings per share and 
were for the benefit of all shareholders.
As previously reported, the directors intend to continue to actively 
pursue the buyback programme provided the necessary funds 
are available. Shares will only be bought back for cancellation 
provided they enhance earnings per share. Any shareholder who is 
considering taking advantage of the share buyback programme is 
invited, after taking the appropriate independent financial advice, 
to contact their stockbroker, bank manager, solicitor, accountant 
or other independent financial advisor authorised under the 
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, in order to contact N+1 
Brewin who are operating the buyback programme on behalf of 
the company. Accordingly at the next Annual General Meeting 
shareholders will be asked to vote in favour of a resolution to 
renew the general authority to make market purchases of up to 
12.5% of the ordinary share capital in issue.
OUTLOOK
The group's policy of reducing its reliance on its traditional core 
products and services together with the increase in non-seasonal 
business and investment in new technically advanced and 
environmentally friendly products will be continued into 2012.
The group continues to face challenges in all of its geographical 
markets but our business remains strong, cash generative and 
well developed with positive net funds. The board is therefore 
optimistic for further success in 2012.
