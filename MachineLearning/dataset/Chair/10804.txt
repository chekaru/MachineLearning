The group's revenue for the year ended 31 December 2013 was  61.1 million, an increase of  2.7 million, or 4.6%, compared with the same 
period last year. This increase had a favourable impact on operating profit which increased by  0.5 million from  14.2 million* last year 
to  14.7 million in the year under review. This increase is despite the lack of revenue in the current year from contracts in connection 
with the Olympic and Paralympic games which benefited the performance for 2012.
The basic earnings per share increased by 4.1% from 26.18p* last year to 27.25p in the current period. There were no share buybacks in 
the period and this increase reflects the strong trading performance of the group again this year.
The group continues to generate strong cash flows. Net cash inflow from operating activities was  14.2 million, an improvement of  1.4 
million compared with last year . Net funds increased from  15.6 million last year to  19.1 million at 31 December 2013 despite shareholder 
related cash outflows of  7.5 million on equity dividends. The level of external bank borrowings remains unchanged as at 31 December 
2013 from the previous year following the refinancing exercise in April 2013. 
Cost control, cash and working capital management continue to be priorities for the group. Capital expenditure on the hire fleet increased 
from  4.2 million in 2012 to  4.6 million this year and the group invested a further  0.8 million on property, plant and equipment. 
These actions will ensure that the group's infrastructure and revenue generating assets are sufficient to support future growth and 
profitability. Hire fleet utilisation, condition and availability continue to be the subjects of management focus.

Our main hire and sales business in the UK and Europe has again faced challenging trading conditions throughout 2013 mainly as a result 
of some unhelpful weather conditions but also due to economic conditions particularly in certain European territories. Consequently 
the business segment had mixed fortunes with Andrews Sykes Hire Limited in the UK performing significantly better than last year and 
our subsidiaries in Belgium and Northern Italy also returning an improved performance. However, after a very successful year in 2012, 
Andrews Sykes BV in Holland suffered a reduction in operating profit and, as expected, our business in France returned an operating 
loss in 2013 during its first year of trading. Overall, the operating profit of this business segment increased from  13.1 million last year 
to  13.5 million in 2013.
The weather at the beginning of the year was relatively cold thereby helping the performance of our heating division. However, this 
was short lived and was replaced by much milder conditions which lasted until the middle of June when a spell of warmer weather 
finally arrived giving a boost to our all-important air conditioning hire and sales business. The autumn and winter that followed were 
exceptionally mild and wet which did nothing for our heating products but which did assist the performance of our UK pumping business. 
Improvements were apparent in the UK economy but less so in our other European territories with a reduction in the level of construction 
work throughout Holland. 
The performance for the year clearly demonstrates our ability to deliver acceptable profit levels even in times of unfavourable external 
influence and is due, in part, to a diverse product range that is able to return a robust performance during any extreme weather 
conditions. This is supported by the continuing development of non-weather dependent niche markets which continue to benefit the 
performance of our specialist hire divisions. We will continue to invest in and develop these businesses as well as our traditional core 
products and services.
Our hire and sales business in the Middle East had a very successful year with the operating profit for this business segment improving 
from  1.2 million last year to  1.8 million in the current year. This reflects improved market conditions which had a positive impact on 
our traditional dewatering, sewage and general pump hire activities. In addition our climate rental division which was formed in 2012 
returned a positive contribution to the business results.

Overview and financial highlights

The operating profit for our fixed installation business sector in the UK fell from nearly  1.0 million in 2012 to  0.4 million in the current 
year . However , this was expected as the business had a successful year in 2012 due to a significant contract for the supply of equipment 
in connection with the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Excluding this contract, the business continues to perform broadly in line with 
last year albeit at relatively modest levels compared with the rest of the group.
Profit for the financial year
Profit before tax was  15.0 million this year compared with  14.8 million* last year. This is due to the above  0.5 million improvement 
in operating profit, a reduction of  0.4 million in dividends received from Oasis Sykes, our trade investment in Saudi Arabia, from  
 0.6 million last year to  0.2 million in 2013, and a  0.1 million reduction in finance costs. Tax charges amounted to  3.5 million, a 
reduction of  0.2 million compared with 2012, resulting in a profit for the financial year of  11.5 million compared with  11.1 million*  
last year.
 
Equity dividends
The company declared two interim dividends during the year, both of 8.9 pence per ordinary share. The first was declared on 18 June 
2013 and was paid on 24 July 2013; the second was declared on 28 October 2013 and was paid on 3 December 2013. Therefore total 
ordinary dividends paid to shareholders in the year were in excess of  7.5 million. 
I am pleased to announce that, in view of the group's ongoing profitability and its significant cash resources, the board has proposed a 
2013 final dividend of 11.9 pence per ordinary share. If approved at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting this dividend, which in total 
amounts to  5.0 million, would be paid on 19 June 2014 to shareholders on the register on 30 May 2014.
 
Net funds
At 31 December 2013 the group had net funds of  19.1 million compared with  15.6 million last year, an increase of  3.5 million despite 
the payment of the above two interim dividends totalling  7.5 million.
Renewal of bank loan facilities
The group's previous bank loan agreements expired on 30 April 2013. In order to safeguard the group's cash position and to ensure 
that the group has adequate liquid resources available to finance any business opportunities that may arise, a new loan of  8.0 million 
was taken out on the same day to finance the loan repayment. This new loan is for four years with annual repayments of  1.0 million 
commencing on 30 April 2014 and a final balloon payment of  5.0 million due on 30 April 2017. Interest is charged based on LIBOR plus 
a fixed margin of 1.2% and mandatory costs. 
Share buybacks
During the current year the company did not purchase any ordinary shares for cancellation. However, in prior periods such purchases 
were made and these enhanced earnings per share and were for the benefit of all shareholders.
The board believes that it is in the best interest of shareholders if they have this authority in order that market purchases may be made 
in the right circumstances if the necessary funds are available. Accordingly, at the next Annual General Meeting, shareholders will be 
asked to vote in favour of a resolution to renew the general authority to make market purchases of up to 12.5% of the ordinary share 
capital in issue.
Outlook
The group's policy to increase investments in new technologically advanced and environmentally friendly non-seasonal products will 
be continued into 2014. Investments will also continue in our traditional businesses to ensure we are ready to support our customers in 
times of extreme weather conditions.
The group continues to face challenges in all of its geographical markets but our business remains strong, cash generative and well 
developed, with positive net funds. Improvements have been seen in the UK, especially the pumping business, and the Middle East 
business sector during 2013 but these have been partially offset by a downturn in trading in Holland. Management is currently addressing 
this issue and the board is therefore cautiously optimistic for further success in 2014.
