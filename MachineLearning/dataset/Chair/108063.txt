Directors' Pensions
The Executive Directors who served during the year have retirement benefits accruing under the Group's Staff Pension Scheme,
which is a Defined Benefit Scheme.
The following table shows the amount of entitlements earned, the accrued pension liabilities and the changes therein:

G T Quayle -2 31 1 153 649 489
The accrued pension is the amount that the Director would receive if he retired at the end of the year. The increase in the accrued
pension is the difference between the accrued benefit at the year end and that at the previous year end.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with technical actuarial standards issued by
the Board for Actuarial Standards. The transfer values represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to
transfer to another pension provider on transferring the scheme's liability in respect of the Directors' pension benefits. They do not
represent sums payable to individual Directors and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The increase in transfer value less Directors' contributions is the increase in the transfer value of the accrued benefits during the year
after deducting the Directors' personal contributions to the scheme.
The transfer value of net increase in accrual, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value of the increase in accrued
benefits that the Director has earned in the period, whereas his change in transfer value, required by the Companies Act, discloses
the absolute increase or decreases in his transfer value and includes the change in value of the accrued benefits that results from
market volatility affecting the transfer value at the beginning of the period, as well as the additional value earned in the year.
Share Options
At the 2000 Annual General Meeting shareholders approved the introduction of the Unapproved Part of the 1998 Senior Executive
Share Option Scheme. The movements on this Scheme during the year were: -

The maximum number of shares that can be awarded to any
participant in a financial year under the Long Term Incentive
Scheme, determined by reference to average mid market prices
at the time of the award, is limited to 50% of the participant's
basic salary. The average mid market price of the awards
granted in the year was  2.273.
The Awards are subject to the following performance conditions:
  Awards will vest in full if the earnings per share, adjusted for
IFRS pension adjustments, exceed the increase in retail price
index plus 10% per annum over a three year period;
  Awards will vest as to 10% if the earnings per share, adjusted
for IFRS pension adjustments, exceed the increase in retail
price index plus 2.5% per annum over a three year period;
  Awards will vest proportionally between 10% and 100% if the
earnings per share, adjusted for IFRS adjustments, exceed the
increase in retail price index by more than 2.5% and less than
10% per annum over a three year period;
  Awards will lapse if earnings per share, adjusted for IFRS
pension adjustments, do not exceed the increase in retail
price plus 2.5% per annum over a three year period.
The market price of the shares at the period end was  1.81 and
the high and low for the period was  2.43 and  1.52
