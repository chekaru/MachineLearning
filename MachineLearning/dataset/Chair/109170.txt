The year under review is the first following the smoking ban in England in July 2007.
Total sales increased by  19.0 million to  907.5 million, a rise of 2% (2007: 5%).
We achieved an increase in LFL food sales (up 8%) combined with an anticipated
decline in LFL bar sales (down by 4%), resulting in an overall LFL sales decline of 1%.
Including those bar purchases made in association with table meals, diners now
account for approximately two-thirds of sales.
Chairman's statement and operating review
A consequence of this shift in sales towards food was a
slight decline in operating margin, from 10.3% in the
previous year to 9.6%, resulting from food margins being
lower than bar margins and higher labour costs.
Operating profit decreased by 4% to  87.2 million
(2007:  91.1m). Profit before tax (excluding a non-cash
 mark to market' loss, in respect of interest rate swaps of
 0.8m) decreased by 11% to  55.0 million 
(2007:  62.0m). Earnings per share decreased by 9% to
25.7p (2007: 28.1p), excluding the  mark to market' loss
and the benefit resulting from the change in corporation
tax rates last year.
Net interest (excluding the fair value loss on derivatives)
was covered 2.7 times (2007: 3.1 times) by operating
profit. Free cash flow, after payments of tax, interest,
share purchases under the company's share plans and
capital investment of  12.3 million in existing pubs
(2007:  24.0m), was  71.7 million (2007:  52.4m),
resulting in record free cash flow per share of 50.7p
(2007: 35.6p). Capital expenditure in the year under
review was lower, since the previous year saw higher
investment in gardens and kitchens in anticipation of the
smoking ban. In addition, the working capital movement
improved by  10 million in the year.
We achieved an increase
in LFL food sales
(up 7.9%)...
During the year the company financed cash dividend
payments of  17.4 million, share buybacks of 
 12.0 million and expenditure of  48.6 million on
new pubs and site acquisitions, with net borrowings
increasing slightly by  5.8 million to  439.6 million
(2007:  433.8m).
Property
The company opened 23 pubs during the year,
compared with 18 in the previous year, resulting in a
total estate of 694.We currently intend to open around
30 pubs in the year ending July 2009 and anticipate
having sufficient properties in the course of acquisition
and development to be able to continue this rate of
expansion in future.
Property prices and rent-review settlements appear to
have declined significantly in the course of the year.These
reasonable property prices will clearly create opportunities
for profitable investment by Wetherspoon in the future.
Dividends, return of capital
The board proposes, subject to shareholders' consent,
to pay a final dividend of 7.6p per share, on 
21 November 2008, to those shareholders on the 
register on 24 October 2008, giving an unchanged 
total dividend for the year of 12.0p per share.
Dividend is covered 2.1 times (2007: 2.3 times excluding
the one-off benefit to tax change) by earnings per share.
During the year 3,835,000 shares (representing
approximately 2.7% of the issued share capital) were
purchased by the company for cancellation, at a cost 
of  12.0 million, representing an average cost per 
share of 314p.

Taxation
The overall tax charge for the year is 34.4% 
(2007: 33.3% comparable basis adjusted for change in
the deferred tax rate from 30% to 28%).The increase 
is largely due to a reduced tax credit from employee
share schemes.
Finance
The company had  82.6 million (2007:  88.4m) of
unutilised banking facilities and cash balances as at 
27 July 2008, with total facilities of  522.2 million
(2007:  522.2m).The year's capital expenditure on new
pub developments was more than covered by free cash
flow.The company remains in a sound financial position.
Further progress 
As indicated in previous years, our approach is to try to
make lots of small improvements in diverse areas of the
business, creating momentum in the services and
facilities offered to customers, as well as sales and
financial momentum for the company.
In the area of real ale, we stock over 600 guest beers
throughout the year, from breweries across the UK,
Ireland and other countries.We are in the course of
training more than 1,500 staff, in association with local
breweries and Cask Marque, in order to continue sales
growth in this area. Currently, 131 of our pubs are
recommended in the CAMRA Good Beer Guide 2007
- more pubs, and a higher percentage of the estate, than
any other substantial company.We ran the biggest real-ale
festival in the world during April 2008, selling 
2.5 million pints over 18 days - an increase in LFL
volumes of over 7%, compared with the same festival 
in 2007.
We ran the biggest real-ale
festival in the world during
April 2008...
We also ran a wine festival during May and June, selling
over 495,000 equivalent bottles of wine - an increase of
20% on the same period last year. During the festival, we
broke the Guinness world record for the largest multiple-
location wine tasting event, with over 17,500 participants.
We introduced Coors Light, which is now our third best
selling lager, and have become the largest retailer of this
product in the UK.This helped return draught lager
sales, adversely affected by the smoking ban, to growth 
in the 4th quarter, demonstrating the company's
capability in terms of nationwide product launches,
following similar successes with Kopparberg cider,
Pimm's and Lavazza coffee, for example.
Food accounted for 29% of our sales during the year,
compared with 27% in the previous year, 17% 11 years
ago, and 5% at flotation in 1992. Including those bar
purchases made in association with table meals, diners
now account for approximately two-thirds of sales. Food 
sales per pub, per week, for the year were  8,800 incl.
VAT. (2007:  8,200). In the light of our competitive
prices, we believe that we sell more meals per pub, per
week, than any other substantial pub company.
Coffee and tea sales continue to increase, up 6.6% in
total to average 443,000 servings per week.We are now
the world's number-one seller of  Tierra', Lavazza's
sustainable coffee from Rainforest Alliance.
We also won Eat Out magazine's winner of
 MenuMasters 2008 Best Kids Menu' award, recognising
the work which we have carried out to increase organic
and free range products on the menu.
In both food and bar sales, it remains our aim to
continue to provide the highest-quality products at
competitive prices, and to introduce a limited range of
new brands, in association with our suppliers, in the
course of future months and years.
Recycling
We continue to concentrate on recycling and believe
that we recycle more than any other pub company. In
2007/08, we recycled 5,281 tonnes of waste (an increase
of 4%), including 3,136 tonnes of cardboard, 1,616
tonnes of cooking oil, 95 tonnes of plastic, 19 tonnes of
aluminium and 415 tonnes of paper. Pubs' recycling has
exceeded 16,000 tonnes over the last four years.
Glass-recycling has been given greater emphasis;
together with our partner, Biffa, we successfully recycled
5,000 tonnes in 2007/08, representing over 23% of the
glass waste which we generate. J D WETHERSPOON PLC 4
We were recognised for our efforts in recycling and
received the High Street Recycling Champion award
2007 from letsrecycle.com.
Government taxation and regulation
The pub industry, in common with many businesses, has
been strongly affected by increases in taxation and
regulation in recent years. In the current financial year,
we continue to estimate that increases in excise duty on
alcoholic drinks, minimum wage related costs and 
increased statutory holiday entitlements will amount to
 16 million. Energy increases, which clearly have an
inflationary effect, receive widespread attention from
economists and the media. It is interesting to note that
the effects of government legislation on our business
have a far greater impact, and are, therefore, more
inflationary than energy increases.
Licensing
It is the company's policy to work closely with a variety
of organisations, including local authorities and the police,
to improve behaviour in association with pub visits.We
strongly support Pubwatch, an organisation bringing
together licensees and the police, which has been
extremely successful in improving standards of behaviour
in many town and city centres.As a company, we are also
a member of National Pubwatch and The Drinkaware
Trust, and support the activities of the Portman Group.
We operate the Challenge 21 policy in all of our pubs.
In order to ensure effective implementation of this
campaign we provide support and training to all of our
staff and carry out regular audits of our performance.
People
The most important factor in successful pubs is good
customer service.Wetherspoon continues to provide a
comprehensive employee training system which has won
many awards, over the years, from the relevant training
bodies.This year our National Diploma in Leisure Retail
Management Course, operated in conjunction with
Nottingham Trent University, won an award as part of the
National Innkeeping Training Awards and we featured in
Britain's T op 100 Employers handbook, as published by
The Guardian, for the fifth consecutive year.
We encourage internal promotion, with many pub
managers starting as bar staff and many area managers
being promoted from pub manager. Outstanding
examples are Su Cacioppo, our personnel and legal
director, having started her career as a trainee pub
manager 17 years ago, and John Hutson, our chief
executive, who started as an area manager around 
the same time.
In addition, we provide monthly bonuses for all of our
pub staff, whatever their length of service in the
company. In the year under review, we spent a total of
 16 million on bonuses and share awards for employees.
I would like to thank our employees, partners and
suppliers, once again, for their excellent work in the
past year.
Current trading and outlook
In the five weeks to 31 August 2008, LFL sales increased
by 1.1% and total sales by 5.5%, making this August our
busiest ever.
In common with many pub and restaurant businesses,
we continue to expect a considerable increase in the
current year in expenditure relating to energy, food,
labour and tax.We hope to offset this by improvements
in every area of the business and by increases in sales.
In order to achieve a similar trading performance this
year we currently estimate we would need LFL sales of
around 3%.
In a traumatic year for the pub industry following the
smoking ban,Wetherspoon has again demonstrated that
concentrating on customer service, standards, and placing
emphasis on staff training and incentives, are the key
ingredients to long term success, especially during a
downturn in the general economy.
As a result of our strong cash flow, our dedicated
management team and our efforts to improve every area
of the business, we remain confident of our prospects.
