 4 Johnson Service Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Chairman's Statement
The restructuring of the Drycleaning
business announced at the half year was
implemented to plan and has yielded
positive results. 
We are proposing a final dividend of
0.7 4 pence (2011: 0.67 pence) per share,
making a total dividend for the full year of
1.1 pence (2011: 1.0 pence), an increase
of 10% in line with our underlying
profitability.
Group Results
T otal continuing revenue for the year
increased to  251.0 million (2011:  233.9
million), while revenue, excluding costs
recharged to customers, was  244.2 million
(2011:  228.6 million). Continuing adjusted
operating profit increased by 8.2% to 
 19.8 million (2011:  18.3 million). The key
drivers of this performance are explained
more fully in the Operating Review.
Net finance costs in 2012 were 
 3.5 million (2011:  3.8 million) with the
benefit of the lower margin and LIBOR
costs during the period more than offsetting
the absence of any notional interest credit
on net pension liabilities of  0.7 million
which was included in 2011.
Adjusted profit before tax on a continuing
basis increased by 10.1% to  16.3 million
(2011:  14.8 million).
Amortisation and impairment of
intangibles (excluding software
amortisation) on continuing operations
amounted to  2.8 million (2011: 
 2.6 million).
Net exceptional items from continuing
operations for the year amounted to a
charge of  27 .7 million (2011:  1.6 million
credit) and comprised  22.7 million in
respect of the restructuring of the
Drycleaning business,  0.7 million in
respect of acquisition fees and expenses,
 4.0 million in relation to the integration 
of the two businesses acquired in the first
quarter of the year and  0.3 million in
relation to further exercises to reduce the
quantum and risk relating to the Group's
defined benefit pension schemes. Further
exceptional costs in respect of the
Drycleaning business restructuring
amounting to  1.2 million are anticipated 
in 2013 giving a total expected cost of
 23.9 million, as announced in July 2012. 
The tax charge on the adjusted profit
before tax was at a rate of 21.6% (2011:
24.6%) with both years benefitting from
prior year tax credits. After the exceptional
items and amortisation and impairment of
intangibles (excluding software amortisation)
noted above, the post-tax loss from
continuing operations was  8.6 million
(2011:  10.2 million profit).
Adjusted fully diluted earnings per
share from continuing operations were 
up 19% to 5.0p (2011: 4.2p) although for
2012, this is the same as adjusted basic
earnings per share as potential Ordinary
shares are classed as anti-dilutive in the
given circumstances. 
Continuing fully diluted earnings 
per share after exceptional items and
amortisation and impairment of intangibles
(excluding software amortisation) were 
3.4p loss (2011: 3.8p profit).
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend
of 0.7 4p per share (2011: 0.67p), making 
a total dividend in respect of 2012 of 1.1p
per share (2011: 1.0p), an increase of 10%.
The dividend increase is reflective of the
improvement in underlying adjusted profit
before tax and the cash requirements for
future expansion.
The proposed final dividend, if approved
by Shareholders, will be paid on 17th May
2013 to Shareholders on the register at
close of business on 19th April 2013.
Finances
T otal net debt at the end of 2012 was
 58.5 million (December 2011:  49.7
million) reflecting the acquisitions
completed during the year. 
Interest cover based on continuing
adjusted operating profit was 5.7 times
(2011: 5.2 times) and we continue to 
have significant headroom under our
existing bank facilities.
The existing  77 .0 million bank facility
matures in May 2015 and comprises a
T erm Loan of  52.0 million and a  25.0
million Revolving Credit Facility (RCF),
including overdraft. 
I am pleased to report that the Group has delivered a strong trading performance for the year. We have completed 
and integrated an acquisition in each of the Textile Services and FM divisions adding scale to both businesses.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION OPERATING & FINANCIAL REVIEW
Note: Throughout this statement continuing adjusted operating profit  refers to continuing operating profit before amortisation and impairment of intangibles (excluding software amortisation) and
exceptional items. Adjusted profit before tax  refers to continuing adjusted operating profit less finance costs excluding, in 2011, exceptional finance costs in relation to bank fees.
T erm loan repayments are scheduled as
 1.5 million in June 2013 and  3.0 million
in December 2013 at which point the RCF
reduces to  22.5 million leaving available
bank facilities of  70.0 million at the end 
of 2013.
Our interest cost in 2013 is protected
from increases in LIBOR rates through the
use of interest rate hedges.  40.0 million
of the T erm Loan has been hedged so that
LIBOR was substituted for a fixed rate of
3.0% for 2011 and 2012 reducing to
1.79% for three years from January 2013,
with the balance of bank debt incurring
interest linked to LIBOR. Margins over
LIBOR applicable to the full facility have
reduced from an average rate of 3.2% for
2011 to 2.6% for 2012.
Acquisitions and disposals
2012 was a significant year in terms of
acquisitions with both the Cannon business
and the Nickleby business contributing to
the improved performance, in line with the
Board's strategy to pursue selective, bolt-on
acquisition opportunities.
The disposal of our small drycleaning
and laundry products wholesale business,
Alex Reid Limited, was completed in early
December 2012.
Textile Services
The T extile Services division was created in
July 2012 by the combination of the T extile
Rental and Drycleaning businesses under
the leadership of Chris Sander. Chris has
successfully led the T extile Rental business
over recent years, delivering strong results
in difficult markets.
Pension
The accounting rules for pensions are to
change with effect from financial year
2013, such that the rate of return on assets
is assumed to be equal to the discount rate
applied to liabilities, therefore, for any
defined benefit scheme which has a deficit
the resultant notional interest will always be
a charge. 
Had this revised standard been adopted
early, the resultant charge for 2012 would
be  1.1 million, compared to no cost in
2012 under current accounting rules and
would have reduced adjusted fully diluted
earnings per share by 0.3 pence. This is a
non-cash charge and does not impact on
scheme funding. The anticipated notional
interest charge for 2013 is  0.9 million. The
results for 2012 will be restated at the time
that the results for 2013 are reported.
The recorded net deficit after tax for all 
post retirement benefit obligations has
reduced to  14.0 million from  15.2 million
at December 2011 due to the net impact 
of an out performance of returns on
scheme assets offset by a reduction in 
the discount rate applied to liabilities.
During the last four years we have
implemented a number of actions which
aim to reduce both the size of and risk
attaching to the defined benefit pension
schemes, including in 2012 an enhanced
partial transfer value exercise. This exercise
removed a further  1.5 million of liabilities
from the Schemes. We intend to take
further action to reduce the scale and
deficit of the Schemes.
Deficit contributions directly to the
Schemes together with payments in respect
of liability reducing activities amounted to
 1.9 million in 2012 and are expected to be
 1.9 million in 2013.
Staff
I would like to thank each and every
employee for their continuing commitment
and dedication to driving the Group 
forward and delivering service beyond 
our customers' expectations in an
environment of considerable change.
Outlook
Strategic bolt-on acquisitions form a core
part of our growth strategy and we are
delighted to have acquired the Nickleby and
Cannon T extile Care businesses. We believe
that there are further opportunities to
expand the two Divisions.
The T extile Rental business has had
another successful year with increased
revenue and profit through both organic
growth and through acquisition. The full
benefit of the impact of the business
acquired from Cannon was only evident in
the final months of 2012 and will therefore
improve the full year 2013 performance.
It was really encouraging to see like for 
like growth in our Drycleaning business as 
a result of our proactive measures in 2012
and there is now an air of excitement in this
business which is already performing well 
in 2013 despite the snow in January and
February. I expect to see improved like for
like growth for the current year.
SGP has once again achieved an
increase in revenue and profitability winning
some large customers during the year and 
I expect our very experienced Divisional
management team to produce another year
of improved results in 2013.
The Board is pleased with the results
and the momentum achieved in 2012 and
we are confident that the Group will
continue its progress in 2013.
