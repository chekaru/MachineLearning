 Chairman's Statement
OVERVIEW
2004 has been a year of transition for K3. In line with
our ambitious growth plans, the group has undergone
significant transformation. In March 2004 we completed
the sale of our non-core, legacy manufacturing
software operation based in Crewe and later that year
acquired two businesses operating in the distribution
and retail software sectors. These acquisitions have
changed K3's profile, reflecting our strategy to broaden
the group's business base into complementary, higher
growth markets. K3 is now clearly focused on providing
Microsoft-based business solutions to three sectors:
retail, distribution and manufacturing.
Both acquisitions, renamed K3 Landsteinar and K3
Elucid, are bedding down well and we are pleased with
the trading performance of each although the results
for 2004 do not include a full year's contribution from
either business. Our remaining manufacturing solutions
business made progress over the year in a difficult
market and, in the final quarter, the division
substantially completed the development of its new
flagship product, SmartVisionCRM. Sales of this new
product provide the division with growth prospects for
2005 and the proposed acquisition announced today of
manufacturing software group, Information Engineering
Group (IEG ), is an exciting development.
FINANCIAL RESULTS
Results for the year ended 31 December 2004 reflect
contributions from our newly acquired businesses, K3
Elucid and K3 Landsteinar, as well as the impact of the
disposal of our legacy manufacturing software
operation in March 2004. Elucid, in which we acquired
a 38% investment in November 2003, became a wholly
owned member of the group in April 2004 and
Landsteinar was acquired in October 2004.
Turnover on continuing operations almost doubled to
 8.12m (2003:  4.30m) and adjusted operating profit
1
on continuing operations was  0.59m (2003:  0.63m).
The two acquisitions contributed combined turnover of
 4.23m and adjusted operating profit
2
of  0.57m. Our
on-going manufacturing software division contributed
turnover of  3.88m and adjusted operating profit
3
of
 0.02m. The development costs of  0.47m relating to
the production of its new SmartVisionCRM product 
are included.
Operating loss after amortisation of goodwill of  0.64m
was  0.03m (2003: profit of  0.01m).
The disposal of the legacy manufacturing software
operation based in Crewe resulted in a profit on
disposal of  1.25m and profit before tax was  1.16m
(2003: loss of  0.20m). Adjusted earnings per share
4
were 4.5p (2003: 6.5p) and, after taking into account
goodwill amortisation of  0.64m (2003:  0.46m) and
exceptional items of  1.25m (2003:  0.52m), earnings
per share were 10.0p (2003: loss per share of 3.2p).
Our earnings per share and number of shares in issue
have been restated following the share consolidation
(of one 25p ordinary share for every five 5p ordinary
shares) which we completed in April.
At 31 December 2004, the group had a positive cash
balance of  0.40m compared with  1.23m at 31
December 2003.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Retail Division
The acquisition, in October 2004, of the Alpha
Landsteinar businesses that comprise this division was
the highlight of the year. The business is the principal
UK supplier of Microsoft Navision retail solutions and
was acquired for a total consideration of  6.95m in a
mix of cash and shares. Now renamed K3 Landsteinar,
it gives us a strong platform within the retail sector and
we see excellent growth opportunities ahead.
For the three month period since its acquisition in
October, Landsteinar contributed sales of  2.93m and
adjusted operating profit
5
of  0.44m. Looking forward,
we anticipate that this division will represent the
group's largest profit contributor.
Distribution Division
In the first half of the year, we completed the
acquisition of the remaining 62% shareholding in
distribution software company, PSE, now renamed K3
Elucid Limited. Including the first tranche of shares
which we acquired in November 2003 for  0.19m, the
purchase consideration totals  0.89m.
The acquisition of Elucid represented our first step in
our strategy to diversify into the retail and distribution
software sectors and the business has performed very
strongly. In the nine month period to 31 December
2004, Elucid won 12 new orders worth  0.8m and sales
totalled  1.30m. This represents turnover growth of
23% over the comparable period last year. The
adjusted operating profit
6
contribution was  0.14m.
During the first half of 2005 Elucid is undertaking a
significant upgrade of its core Warehouse Management
module. Whilst this will reduce earnings in the early
months of 2005 (as development costs are written off
as incurred), it should result in increased sales and
profits later in the year.

Manufacturing Division
The group's manufacturing division was restructured
this year. In March, we disposed of our Crewe-based
operation (the Enterprise Systems Division) for  1.92m,
of which  0.05m is deferred, realising a profit on sale of
 1.25m. The sale resulted from our strategic decision
to focus on aligning our product offering with Microsoft,
with whom we have established a close relationship in
the mid-market ERP space.
Our remaining operation, based in Walton-on-Thames,
which provides Microsoft-centric business solutions for
small to medium sized manufacturing companies,
performed solidly in a difficult market. Its newest
product, SmartVisionCRM, was substantially completed
in the final quarter of the year and marks a significant
turning point for the operation. The SmartVision suite,
which has Microsoft's new Customer Relationship
Management (CRM ) software embedded within the
solution, provides a highly attractive solution for
customers wishing to upgrade outdated products. We
believe there are excellent opportunities to market this
new product to our existing customer base as well as
to new customers.
OUTLOOK
K3's growth prospects have been transformed with
the changes made during 2004. The re-shaping of the
company has taken us into related sectors, which
offer us more attractive opportunities for earnings
growth and we now have a solid platform in place
from which to move forward. Most importantly, all our
divisions have a strong product offering of Microsoft-
based solutions.
Following each acquisition we have sought to
consolidate back office functions and identify synergies
in order to underpin improved future performance.
There are good growth opportunities across all three
divisions, most particularly within retail and distribution
and the launch of our new SmartVisionCRM product
offering the prospect of revitalisation of our
manufacturing software division. Since the year end, K3
Elucid has secured a major contract worth some  0.30m
and K3 Landsteinar has secured seven new business
contracts worth in total  6.70m, supporting our confident
view of the growth prospects of these businesses.
K3 ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL ST ATEMENTS 2004 5 As we stated in our interim report, we have ambitious
growth plans for the group. Our portfolio of businesses
is healthy and cash generative and we see significant
growth prospects across all our markets. We have been
seeking opportunities to act as a consolidator within
the manufacturing software sector and are therefore
pleased to announce today the proposed acquisition,
subject to shareholder approval, of Information
Engineering Group (IEG ), UK distributors for the
Syspro range of ERP software for SME manufacturers.
More details of this are provided in a separate
announcement. This acquisition complements and
strengthens our own manufacturing software portfolio
as it offers an upgrade path for existing users to newer
Microsoft-based technologies, as well as providing a
compelling new business proposition for larger mid-
range manufacturers. There are significant synergies
between IEG and our existing manufacturing business
unit, and it is anticipated that these businesses will be
consolidated to increase combined profitability.
We continue to view the group's prospects very
positively.
RESOLUTIONS PROPOSED
Your attention is drawn to a number of resolutions
which are to be proposed as special business at the
company's annual general meeting.
