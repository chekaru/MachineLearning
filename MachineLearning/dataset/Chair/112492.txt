Kalahari Minerals Plc
Annual Report and Financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009

Our interest in Extract Resources Limited
( Extract') remains of paramount importance
to Kalahari as our primary value driver, and we
remain its key, highly active, shareholder with
a 40.8% interest (as at 1 June 2010). Extract has
continued its rapid development programme
on its flagship project, R ssing South, which
has a current JORC resource of 267Mlb of U
3
O
8
at average grades of 487ppm and has been
defined as the highest grade granite-hosted
uranium deposit in Namibia. Importantly,
both Zones 1 and 2 at R ssing South remain
open at depth and strike indicating that the
total resource for the project could exceed
500Mlb of U
3
O
8
, placing it amongst the largest
uranium assets in the world. We remain wholly
supportive of Extract's rapid development
schedule for its world-class uranium assets, and
look forward to the next phase of development
which will include both a resource upgrade
and the publication of a Definitive Feasibility
Study in the coming months.
In order to progress its world-class uranium 
project to its full potential, Extract solidified 
its relationships in Namibia and continued 
to build a team of high calibre experts to 
advance R ssing South towards production. 
Kalahari was therefore instrumental in 
bringing to Extract's Board two exceptional 
Namibian nationals, Steve Galloway as 
Chairman and Inge Zaamwani-Kamwi as 
a Non-executive Director. In addition, in 
October 2009, Norman Green was appointed 
as Chief Executive Officer of Swakop 
Uranium, Extract's wholly-owned subsidiary. 
Norman has a huge amount of experience 
in the resource sector in southern Africa, 
and importantly in Namibia, through his 
commissioning of a number of mines, such 
as the Skorpion Zinc mine. In addition to this, 
Norman will be based in Namibia on a full-
time basis, which we see as vitally important in 
maintaining the strong relationships that we 
have developed with the local authorities.
Post period end, Extract appointed Jonathan
Leslie as its new Chief Executive Officer. 
This appointment marked the culmination 
of a long process intended to identify the 
best person, from an outstanding shortlist 
of industry professionals, to drive Extract 
forward and transform it from a pure 
exploration  company to a tier one uranium 
producer. Jonathan has an exceptional 
level of experience in the uranium sector, 
particularly in marketing and management, 
stemming from his role as Managing Director 
of R ssing Uranium, Rio Tinto's subsidiary, 
which operates the producing R ssing 
Mine. This high profile position, which saw 
him responsible for overall marketing 
of all uranium from the world's largest 
uranium mine, established Jonathan as an 
international expert in the uranium industry 
and a well-respected figure in Namibia, with 
outstanding relationships with the Namibian 
government and mining agencies.
Kalahari also instigated key initiatives during 
the period to maximise the value of its 
non-uranium assets. This has been achieved 
through the relationship established with 
North River Resources Plc ( North River'), 
aimed at fast tracking our gold, copper and 
other base metal projects towards production 
through a joint development agreement, and 
in so doing, attributing tangible value to these 
highly prospective assets. Under the terms of 
this agreement, Kalahari has retained a 44.7% 
interest (as at 1 June 2010) in North River 
and both myself and fellow Kalahari Director 
Professor Glyn Tonge have joined the Board 
of North River to ensure an open dialogue 
between our two companies in the future.
Since forming this relationship in November 
2009, North River has implemented an 
aggressive development programme 
focussed primarily on developing the 
key copper projects and the Namib lead-
zinc project towards production, where 
considerable work was previously carried out 
by Kalahari. 
Corporate Review
The Company continues to focus on 
strengthening the relationship between 
Kalahari and both Extract and North River, 
as well as our position in Namibia, which 
necessitated changes to our Board to align 
the skills and experiences of our Directors 
with our business model. This impetus led to a 
number of new appointments at Board level.
Mr. Neil MacLachlan was appointed to the 
Board of Kalahari in March 2009, and his 
appointment was specifically designed to 
further strengthen the relationship and 
dialogue between us and Extract, through his 
position as a  Non-executive Director for both 
companies. Mr. David de Jongh Weill also 
joined as a Non-executive Director, replacing 
Stephen Galloway, who stepped down to 
assume the position of Chairman of Extract. 
Post period end, Mr. Richard Lockwood also 
joined as a Non-executive Director, bringing 
with him 50 years of experience in institutional 
investment and extensive experience in the 
uranium sector.
In addition to a bolstered corporate team, 
we have welcomed new strategic investors to 
our shareholder register, providing further 
support to our already strong institutional 
backing. Since year end, recent additions to 
our shareholder base have included ITOCHU 
Corporation ( ITOCHU'), a major Japanese 
trading house with an established relationship 
with the Government of Japan. ITOCHU has
taken a circa 15% interest in the Company 
and appointed a representative, Mr. Takashi 
Yasuda, to the Board to ensure the benefits 
of the strategic relationship between the two 
Chairman's Statement
We made excellent progress crystallising the value of our interests in our uranium, gold,
copper and base metal assets in Namibia over the past year, both through operational 
developments and through the implementation of key corporate initiatives.

Chairman's Statement continued
companies is maximised. APAC Resources 
Limited ( APAC'), a major Hong -Kong based 
investment  company, has  acquired circa 7% 
of Kalahari's issued share capital. In addition 
to the support that these investments give to 
our shareholder register, which also includes 
Rio Tinto holding a circa 12.5% interest (as 
at 1 June 2010), both ITOCHU and APAC's 
involvement with Kalahari gives us exposure 
to invaluable relationships and contacts in the 
Asian resource sector. We believe that access 
to this network will be highly beneficial, as we 
work together with Extract in developing the 
world-class R ssing South project towards 
production.
Kalahari has a serious and vested long-term 
interest in Namibia, and in line with this, 
the Company listed on the Namibian Stock 
Exchange ( NSX') in October 2009. This listing 
underpins our ongoing commitment to 
Namibia and the development of its 
huge resource potential to the benefit of
all stakeholders.
Extract also listed on the NSX in October 2009,
and we remain highly supportive of Extract's
corporate development, including the
Nambianisation of its board and corporate
structure. In line with this, representatives from
both Kalahari and Extract, including Jonathan
Leslie, Stephen Galloway and myself, recently
met with both the President and Prime Minister
of Namibia, in order to provide an update on
Extract's activities in the country. In particular,
we emphasised our joint commitment to
Namibia as a whole and our intention to
continue to provide employment and other
ancillary benefits to the Namibian people
through Extract's development activities.

Outlook
The corporate initiatives that we have 
implemented this year have created a solid 
platform for future growth, maximising the 
full potential of our significant uranium, 
gold, copper and other base metal interests 
in Namibia. We believe we have assembled 
a strong, supportive and high quality 
shareholder register, and I look forward to 
working with our key strategic investors over 
the coming year, realising the considerable 
value of our interests for the benefit of all 
stakeholders.
Development work at Husab and progress 
on the R ssing South Definitive Feasibility 
Study continues at pace, with Kalahari's full 
support, and we look forward to the resource 
upgrade and publication of the study, 
which is scheduled for release in the coming 
months. We believe that these developments 
will reiterate the global significance of R ssing 
South, confirming its potential to host one of 
the world's largest uranium mines.
