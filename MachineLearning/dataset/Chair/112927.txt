ContraCt risks 
some of the group's commercial contracts 
include terms where revenues are related to 
performance in the form of bonuses or penalties. 
the group's exposure under such contracts is 
reviewed regularly by the executive Committee 
and the Board.
Credit risk
the main credit risk faced is related to trade 
receivables. the majority of the group's clients 
are state owned or very large oil companies and 
therefore historically the recoverability risk 
tends to be driven more by issues relating 
to client satisfaction and clarification of 
deliverables than by traditional credit risks. 
provision is made for doubtful receivables when 
there are circumstances indicating a likely 
reduction in the recoverable amount such as 
historic late or non-payment of invoices or 
specific customer or contractual issues.
liQuidity risk
Client payment terms can vary from contract to 
contract and can involve extended periods of 
time before invoices are raised. the liquidity 
risk is managed through the use of overdraft 
facilities and a revolving credit facility.
foreign CurrenCies
most transactions continue to be in us dollars, 
euro or sterling. the proportion of revenue 
in each currency was:
  2009 2008
us dollars 47% 47%
euro 30% 37%
sterling 14% 14%
other 10% 2%
where a revenue currency differs to that in 
which costs are incurred, a proportion of the 
foreign exchange exposure is hedged using 
forward exchange contracts in the currency 
markets. Contracts were in place at the balance  
sheet date for the sale of  5m (2008:  3m) 
at an average rate of  1.11 (2008:  1.23) and no 
us dollars (2008: us$1.0m at an average rate 
of us$1.62). 
the group has a number of overseas subsidiaries 
and branches where revenues and costs are 
denominated in currencies other than sterling, 
the most significant of which are in the usA. 
the foreign currency translation exposure 
arising on their results is not hedged (note 23).

Case study/
AddRessing BehA viouRAl ChAnge
A national oil company had two identical process facilities located 
approximately 5km apart - plant A and plant B. the client initiated 
an operating efficiency programme with kBC assistance, starting at 
plant A. while the overall programme at plant A was successful, after 
review of the lessons learnt from the exercise, it was agreed to add to 
the scope for plant B some of the behavioural aspects of the change 
initiative. specific actions were identified and implemented, beginning 
with a management alignment workshop, which communicated the 
importance of the programme to overall future operations. the 
initiatives included delineating roles and responsibilities and reinforcing 
senior executive support for the programme. other efforts designed 
to support the desired behaviours (such as rewards and incentives) 
cascaded from the initial alignment workshop. 
Both initiatives were successful. however, the realised benefit at plant B 
was more than double that at plant A. Regardless of geography or type 
of work, a key enabler to implementing and sustaining improvement 
opportunities is addressing potential behavioural barriers or issues as 
part of the overall process. having the ability to offer behavioural and 
organisational solutions places kBC at a distinct advantage above other 
competitors, and this assists us in addressing one of our clients' primary 
concerns: effectively implementing and sustaining improvement 
opportunities after they have identified.
