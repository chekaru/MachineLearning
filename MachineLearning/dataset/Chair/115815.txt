 LA Fitness plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 8
In reviewing the performance of the
Group for the year ended 31 July 2002,
we are delighted to report that we
continue to grow rapidly and have again
delivered record turnover and profits
during a period of economic slowdown.
This progress continues to be based upon
our organic rollout strategy of building
quality facilities, which are conveniently
located and affordably priced, with a
strong emphasis on customer service,
managed by an experienced and
committed management team. 
The results upon which we report have
been achieved from both organic growth
at existing clubs and the performance of
16 new clubs during the year.
Results
Turnover for the year grew by 67% to
 47.6m (2001:  28.4m). Earnings before
interest, tax and depreciation (EBITDA)
increased by 61% to  13.1m (before
exceptional items) from  8.1m in 2001
and operating profits before exceptional
items increased by 55% to  9.3m (2001:
 6.0m). Profits before tax and exceptional
items rose by 40% to  7.8m (2001:
 5.6m). Profits before tax and after
exceptional items rose by 39% to  7.3m
(2001:  5.3m). 
In May 2002, we announced that due to
continuing uncertainty surrounding the
rollout of broadband ADSL and therefore
the outlook for our fully interactive
television joint venture with BUPA and
Video Networks Limited, we were making
full provision against our investment. There
have been no further developments since
that date, and consequently an exceptional
provision of  0.5m has been made.
Pre-exceptional earnings per share
increased by 46% to 13.3p (2001: 9.1p).
Basic earnings per share rose by 44% to
12.1p (2001: 8.4p).
For the 24 clubs open throughout the last
two years, like-for-like sales increased by
9% (2001: 8%). Joining fees remain at
4% of turnover. We continue to work hard
on seeking and developing opportunities for
driving ancillary income, such as private
training, merchandising and advertising.
For the year ended 31 July 2002, income
arising from sources other than membership
subscriptions and joining fees grew by 54%
and represented 12% of total income.
The gross margin for the year was 27.9%
compared to 31.4% last year. The margin
reduction is attributable to a number of
factors, the most significant of which are an
increase in establishment and insurance
costs, the introduction of a tier of regional
management, and start up costs in Spain.
Costs across the group remain tightly
controlled. We have continued to
strengthen the management infrastructure
of the Group which has increased
administration costs by  1m, not
withstanding which, this cost as a
percentage of turnover has reduced from
10.3% to 8.3% for the year to 31 July
2002. 
During the year, 10 freeholds were sold
and leased back. At the year end, the
company held a further three freeholds 
and one long leasehold premises which 
are expected to be sold and leased back
during the current financial year.
Chairman's and Chief Executive's Review
...The people who work for 
LA Fitness are its core asset
and the team continues to
strengthen in depth. We pride
ourselves on the quality of
recruitment, induction and
training, which continues to
be evidenced by the high
retention rate of senior staff
members... We adopt a conservative accounting policy
and do not capitalise any interest, either
on club developments or on the temporary
holding cost of freeholds. The net bank
interest charge and similar charges for the
year to 31 July 2002 amounted to  1.5m
(2001:  0.4m), of which approximately
 0.4m is directly attributable to the cost 
of holding freeholds prior to their sale 
and leaseback.
Operations
During the year, the enhanced property
team delivered 16 full service quality clubs
taking our total to 53, including the first in
Spain. The strengthening brand enabled us
to continue to benefit from our successful
strategy of recruiting new members prior to
a club opening which provides a solid
platform for the speedy achievement of
membership capacity.
Membership numbers across the Group
have continued to expand rapidly. At 31
July 2002, the Group had 129,510
members at the 53 clubs open, compared
to 88,630 at 31 July 2001, an increase of
40,880 members (46%) in the last 12
months. The 16 clubs that opened during
the last 12 months have achieved
membership numbers consistent with our
model's expectations and averaged 1,900
members per club at the year end. We
believe that member retention is a key
element driving the success of our
business. Our retention rate for the year
was 70%, (2001: 68%). An additional
feature of delivering quality customer
service is that the majority of new
members at existing clubs join as a direct
result of a member's recommendation.
Spain
The initial performance of our first Spanish
club in Barcelona, which opened in March
2002, has given us sufficient confidence 
to commit to a further club opening.
Construction has now commenced at a site
in Madrid and pre-opening membership
sales are due to commence in November.
The fitness market in Spain is very much in
its infancy allowing us time to determine the
speed at which we should rollout there.
Taxation
The Group has adopted for the first time
FRS 19 (Deferred Tax) which requires 
a full provision for deferred taxation for
accounting periods ended on or after 23
January 2002. The introduction of this
standard gives rise to a taxation charge 
for the year of  2.4m, which stated as a
percentage of profits represents 32.6%
(2001: 36.0% restated). This charge
comprises a deferred taxation element of
 1.9m and a corporation tax element of
 0.5m representing a corporation tax rate
payable of 6.3% (2001 7.1%). The
introduction of FRS 19 gives rise to a
restatement of the prior year tax charge
from  0.4m to  1.9m as well as a prior
year adjustment, which reduces retained
reserves by  2.5m.

 The fact that members choose to
spend a large percentage of their
leisure time in our clubs confirms
that we are providing a friendly,
professional environment where
they feel relaxed and comfortable.

Chairman's and Chief Executive's Review continued
Dividend
The Board recommends a final dividend of
0.8p per ordinary share (2001: 0.67p)
payable on 29 November 2002 to
shareholders on the register on 25 October
2002. The total dividends for the year (paid
and proposed) are 1.2p per ordinary share,
an increase of 20% over the previous year.
The dividend reflects the Board's belief that
as a fast growing company, the majority of
retained profits should be applied to
expansion opportunities leading to further
growth in profitability and shareholder
value. 
Funding 
At the year end, the Group had net bank
borrowings of  31.9m representing gearing
of 84% (2001: 55% restated).
In September 2002 our existing bank
facilities were refinanced when the Group
put in place a new committed five-year
debt facility of  90m, replacing the existing
facilities of  40m. The new facilities, which
will be used to fund the continuing rollout
of 15 to 20 new club openings per annum,
are provided by a group of banks comprising
Allied Irish Banks, Barclays Bank and 
The Royal Bank of Scotland as mandated
lead arrangers and Clydesdale Bank as 
co-arranger. The highly competitive terms
which we negotiated for the new facilities
illustrate the confidence that the banking
syndicate has in our business model.
People
The people who work for LA Fitness are 
its core asset and the team continues to
strengthen in depth. We pride ourselves on
the quality of recruitment, induction and
training, which continues to be evidenced
by the high retention rate of senior staff
members. It is a credit to, and a measure
of, the quality of our team that in just three
years we have managed the growth from
15 to 55 clubs.
We would like to take this opportunity to
thank all the LA Fitness team for their
continuing hard work, commitment and
enthusiasm which has contributed to our
success to date and will be the platform 
for our future success.
Current Trading and Prospects 
Since the year end the business has
continued to perform very well and to 
show its resilience in the face of the general
slow down in consumer expenditure.
Furthermore, over the past two months 
the Company has opened two new clubs
and the Board is encouraged that these,
together with the sixteen clubs opened 
in the last financial year, are trading in 
line with management's expectations.
Construction has commenced on twelve
new clubs and we have secured a further
seven sites. 
Growth opportunities for the Company are
exciting. We consider that our segment of
the Health and Fitness industry is a long
way from saturation. Our particular
business model continues to perform
robustly, new site availability is strong and
the demand for conveniently located and
affordably priced clubs demonstrates that
we remain less exposed to the current
economic environment. This, coupled with
the strength of our management team and
the new bank facilities, makes the Board
believe that LA Fitness can grow to
comfortably in excess of 100 clubs and
view the future with confidence.
