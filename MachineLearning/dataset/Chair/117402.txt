compared to 
 12.2 million in the

Overview
I am pleased to report for the
financial year ended 26 January 2008,
an increase in profit before taxation
of 62.3% to  19.8 million, compared
to  12.2 million in the previous year.
The profit of  19.8 million includes 
a pension credit of  2.3 million which
has occurred as a result of a transfer
value exercise that was completed
on 16 July 2007. In addition, we 
have also benefited from gains 
on disposals of various properties 
and related assets amounting to 
 1.7 million.
Total group sales were up by 
 12.6 million (5.6%) to  237.6 million,
compared to  225.0 million in the
previous year. Margin rate continues
to improve, with a 2 percentage
point increase this year. The
improved total retail sales position
was primarily due to increased UK
sales in all categories. For the year
ended 26 January 2008, total UK
store sales were up 7.2% to  187.2
million (LFL -8.7%). Total sales growth
has primarily been driven by our
store realignment programme.
However, some of the new stores
that we have opened have impacted
sales from existing stores, which 
has impaired LFL sales. We believe 
a more accurate sales LFL, excluding
existing stores impacted by new
stores, to be -5.9%. Through our 
store realignment programme, we
have increased total selling space
and total sales in the UK. In addition,
other than Furniture which has
remained flat, margin rates across 
all other categories have increased
year on year.
We have again increased margins as
a result of our ongoing improvements
in sourcing, more focused promotions
and better product mix. In line with
increased turnover and the addition
of new stores, operating expenses
(excluding the impact of non-
recurring items) have increased 
by 7.8% to  97.3 million (2007: 
 90.2 million).
The Board has recommended a 
final dividend of 1.0 pence per share.
When combined with the two interim
dividends, both 0.5 pence, this takes
the total dividend for the year to 
2.0 pence per share (40% of nominal
value) (2007: 1.0 pence per share).
Product
The UK business is split into four
main categories. The relative split 
of UK sales is as follows: Home
Accessories 30%, Furniture 28%,
Decorating 23% and Fashion 19%. 
In common with many retailers in 
the UK, we have experienced tough
trading conditions that have adversely
impacted sales performance in all
product categories.
Home Accessories
The Home Accessories product
category includes lighting, gifts, bed
linen, rugs, throws and cushions, and
epitomises Laura Ashley's focus on
distinctive, inspirational and quality
product offerings.
During the year ended 26 January
2008, sales of Home Accessories
were up 5.5% (LFL -10.0%). Our
casual dining range, mirrored
accessories, home fragrance and
photo frames have all performed
well, as has our recently launched
toiletry range.  HOME ACCESSORIES LAURA ASHLEY HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report 2008

Chairman's Statement continued
Laura Ashley continues to seek
inspiration from a wide variety of
sources and we refresh a large
proportion of our range every season.
It is this innovation and willingness 
to take creative risks that makes
Laura Ashley a leader in high-street
design, particularly in lighting.
Margin improvement in this 
category has been driven both by
better sourcing, which has resulted 
in higher intake margins, and by
lower markdown levels.
Furniture
The Furniture product category
includes upholstered furniture, beds
and cabinet furniture. Laura Ashley
differentiates its offering from that 
of other retailers by the exciting 
use of colour and fabrics, and our
mix of classic and contemporary 
furniture shapes.
Tough trading conditions have
adversely impacted Furniture to 
a greater extent than the other
product categories. During the year
ended 26 January 2008, Furniture
sales were up 0.5% (LFL -12.8%).
We continue to work on product
differentiation and innovation 
in our furniture category. Our 
well-known ranges are regularly
refreshed and updated to meet
customer demand and to ensure 
that they remain relevant to
contemporary living.
Laura Ashley also offers individual
statement pieces which can be
developed and complemented 
by other items of furniture in future.
More direct overseas sourcing of
certain furniture ranges has driven
margin benefits.
Total group sales were
up by  12.6 million
(5.6%) to  237.6 million,
compared to 
 225.0 million in 
the previous year. FURNITURE Decorating
This category includes curtains,
fabric, paint, decorative accessories
and wall coverings. During the year
ended 26 January 2008, Decorating
sales were up 6.9% (LFL -5.6%)
reflecting the growing trend for
customers to update rooms on a
regular basis in line with changing
fashions.
Laura Ashley was ahead of the 
recent wallpaper trend, and we have
been building on this strength whilst
continuing to add new designs to our
archive. Statement wallpapers have
continued to perform well. A new
colour palette has been successful
across numerous product categories
and we have introduced a number 
of exciting decorative accessories.
Faster lead times and our UK
manufacturing base for this category
allow us to react quickly and
effectively to consumer demand. 
The benefits of this strategy can 
be seen in the success of our 
Made-To-Measure curtain range.
We have seen margin rate growth
due to changes in product mix and
sourcing arrangements.
Fashion
For the year ended 26 January 2008,
UK retail Fashion sales increased 
by 7.7% (LFL -4.4%). The Fashion
category has seen the largest
improvement in margin rate, driven
by a policy of restricting markdown
largely to sale periods and the
increased use of planned, in-season
point-of-sale promotions.
In the spring summer season, dresses
were amongst our strongest sellers,
with both plain and printed woven
linen dresses a particular success. In
the autumn winter season, sales have
been strong on our newly-expanded
range of coats.
Our use of Laura Ashley archive
prints in both seasons attracted a
great deal of positive publicity and
has refreshed the brand to attract 
an audience that is diverse in age
and interests.
UK Operations
Retail Stores
At 26 January 2008, the property
portfolio in the UK comprised 208
stores. We have three main store
types: 110 mixed product stores
(selling all product categories), 67
Home stores (selling the full range 
of Home products) and 31 Home
concession stores.
During the year ended 26 January
2008, we opened 33 new stores
totalling 157,000 square feet and
closed 14 mainly smaller stores
totalling 29,000 square feet. As a
result, total selling space increased
by 20% to 751,000 square feet.
We intend to continue our store
development programme, subject 
to our normal property selection
criteria.
Direct
Our E-Commerce and Mail Order
channels remain a vital part of our
multi-channel retail strategy, now
representing 11% of total UK retail
sales. Total E-commerce and Mail
Order sales were up 1.0% on last
year. Within this figure and reflecting
the trend we have seen over the 
last 4 years, E-Commerce sales were
up 30.5% and Mail Order sales 
were down 13.5%.
We now have 529,000 registered 
E-Commerce customers (2007:
416,000). Our website and various
catalogues remain important
marketing tools for the brand.

We have again
increased margins as 
a result of our ongoing
improvements in
sourcing, more focused
promotions and better
product mix.
Chairman's Statement continued DECORATING International Operations
Franchising
At 26 January 2008, there were 
204 franchised stores in 27 countries
worldwide. Franchising continues 
to be an important part of the Laura
Ashley brand and we are making
good progress on the review of 
our franchise operations.
In the year ended 26 January 2008,
Franchise revenues increased by
6.8% to  20.3 million.
Licensing
In the year ended 26 January 2008,
Licensing income decreased by
29.2% to  3.4 million due mainly to 
a fourth-quarter underperformance 
in North America.
Dividend
The Board has recommended a 
final dividend of 1.0 pence per share.
When taken with the first interim
dividend of 0.5 pence per share 
and the second interim dividend of
0.5 pence per share (approved on 
16 September 2007 and 16 January
2008 respectively), this takes the total
dividend for the year to 2.0 pence
per share (2007: 1.0 pence per 
share). This dividend will be paid,
subject to shareholders approval, 
on 6 June 2008 to all shareholders 
on the register at the close of
business on 9 May 2008. The Board
will continue to review dividend
payments on the basis of annual
profitability, taking into account the
future development of the business.

Current Trading
For the 7 weeks to 15 March 2008,
total retail sales increased by 5.2%.
For the same period, like-for-like
sales were down 8.8%. Margin 
rates have continued to improve.
The outlook for the UK economy 
is uncertain for 2008 so, whilst we are
confident that our strong brand and
product offering are compelling, we
remain cautious about the general
trading conditions on the high street
for the year ahead.
Retailer of the Year

We are indeed very honoured and
humbled to receive this prestigious

We would like to express our grateful

with the highest level of customer
service.
