Overview
For the 52 weeks to 29 January 2011, 
profit before taxation was up 119% at 
 24.1 million (2010:  11.0 million). 
Excluding gains from exceptional

Total Group sales increased by 
 16.6 million (6.2%) to  285.0 million 
compared to the previous year of 
 268.4 million. Improved sales were 
recorded across the Internet, Retail 
Stores and the Franchise business 
channels. For the year ended 
29 January 2011, total Internet sales 
grew by 45% to  32.0 million whilst 
UK store sales were up 2.5% to 
 218.8 million (LFL +2.9%). Retail 
space was reduced by 53,000 square 
feet (6%), as the UK portfolio was 
reduced by 14 stores, from 231 to 217.
In spite of greater supplier costs due 
to the increases in commodity costs, 
gross margin rates were maintained 
at last year levels. Operating 
expenses remained broadly flat at 
 105.6 million (2010:  105.2 million).
Cash Flow and Balance 
Sheet
Cash generated from operations in 
the year was  29.1 million (2010: 
 20.3 million). The net increase in 
cash balances over the year was 
 21.1 million with the Group holding 
 38.5 million in cash as at the year 
end (2010:  17.4 million).
Exceptional Items
An exceptional gain of  4.8 million 
was recorded during the year. This 
related to the sale of the Bardon 
warehouse, the disposal of a number 
of leases and a provision in respect 
of legal costs incurred in defending a 
trademark litigation
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 1.0 pence per share. 
When taken with the interim 
dividend of 0.5 pence per share paid 
on 10 November 2010, this takes the 
total dividend for the year to 
1.5 pence per share (2010: Total 
dividend of 1.0 pence per share). 
This dividend will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM ) 
on 6 June 2011 and, subject to 
shareholders' approval, will be paid 
on 15 July 2011 to all shareholders 
on the register at the close of 
business on 17 June 2011.
The Board will continue to review 
dividend payments on the basis of 
annual profitability, the economic 
climate and the needs of the 
business.

UK Retail
Chairman's Statement continued
As at 29 January 2011, the property 
portfolio in the UK comprised 217 
stores (2010: 231). We have five main 
store types: 138 Mixed Product 
stores (selling all product categories), 
55 Home stores (selling Home 
products only), 22 Home concession 
stores, 1 Gifts & Accessories store 
and 1 Clearance outlet. During the 
year, 2 Home stores were converted 
to Mixed Product stores. 
As we focus on becoming a leader in 
Home Interior Design, 3 stores have 
now opened design studios, building 
on our existing design service. 
Further design studios will be added 
in the coming twelve months. We 
also plan to increase our dedicated 
headcount in this area, as Home 
Interior design becomes a more 
important and distinguishing part of 
our retail business.
During the year ended 29 January 
2011, we opened 2 new stores and 
closed 16 stores. As a result, total 
selling space fell by 6.0% to 833,000 
square feet. The store closures are 
part of the ongoing store portfolio 
realignment programme, which is 
focused on optimising profitability. 
The realignment will also focus on 
the acquisition of smaller, new 
concept stores and optimising space 
in our existing portfolio to drive 
additional density. 
Our E-Commerce channel remains a 
key part of our multi-channel retail 
strategy, representing 12.5% of total 
UK retail sales (11.2% of total Group 
sales). This has increased from 9% of 
total UK Retail sales last year (8.2% of 
total Group sales.) Total E-Commerce 
and Mail Order sales were up 25% on 
last year. Within this figure and 
reflecting the trend we have seen 
over recent years, E-Commerce sales 
were up 45.0%, more than 
compensating for an ongoing market 
decline in Mail Order sales. The 
Laura Ashley application is now 
available to download for free on 
both the iPhone and iPad. 
Our E-Commerce 
channel remains a 
key part of our multi-
channel retail strategy, 
representing 12.5% of 
total UK retail sales.

Product
The UK business is split into four 
main categories. For the financial 
year ended 29 January 2011, the 
relative split of UK sales is as follows: 
Furniture 30%, Home Accessories 
28%, Decorating 22% and 
Fashion 20%. 
Furniture
The Furniture product category 
includes beds, upholstered furniture, 
mirrors and cabinet furniture.
Total Furniture sales increased 7.2% 
(LFL +8.9%) for the year ended 29 
January 2011.  We were encouraged 
by the strong performance of 
Furniture through the E-Commerce 
channel. 
The success of the furniture offer 
continues to be a feature of the 
business. This is based on additional 
sales from range extensions, new 
fabrics and colour options for 
upholstery and the introduction of 
new mirror ranges.
Home Accessories 
The Home Accessories product 
category includes lighting, gifts, bed 
linen, rugs, throws, cushions and 
children's accessories.
During the year ended 29 January 
2011, sales of Home Accessories 
increased by 3.1% (LFL +4.0%). 
Distinctive patterns and on trend 
colour palettes have supported 
growth in our bedroom collections. 
Our accessory ranges provided an 
affordable means for customers to 
update their homes.
Decorating
This category includes curtains, 
blinds, fabric, paint, decorative 
accessories and wall coverings.
During the year ended 29 January 
2011, Decorating sales were up 5.3% 
(LFL +6.3%).
Archive patterns have made a major 
contribution to the success of both 
fabrics and wallpapers. Our exclusive 
patterns and distinctive colour 
palettes have been extremely 
popular. We continue to respond to 
key trends as well as updating our 
core classic options. Made to 
measure curtains and blinds are a 
significant sales driver in this 
category.
Fashion
For the year ended 29 January 2011, 
UK retail fashion sales increased by 
2.6% (LFL +1.7%) in what continued 
to be a highly competitive consumer 
environment. 
Our strong performance in this 
category has been based on key 
dress and skirt shapes. Additionally, 
we have improved quality and fit 
across the entire range and this has 
had a notable effect on sales 
particularly in the trouser category. 
Our nightwear, swimwear and 
accessories categories have also 
continued to perform well.
We previously announced the launch 
of our Weekend range, which, 
together with our Essentials range, 
have become welcome additions to 
our fashion category. These new, 
small ranges broaden and enhance 
our overall fashion offer. 
We recently launched a Girlswear 
range (Ages 2 - 8). This is being sold 
in 35 of our fashion stores and online. 
Initial reactions from both the Press 
and customers have been positive.
The success of the 
furniture offer 
continues to be a 
feature of the business. 
This is based on 
additional sales from 
range extensions, new 
fabrics and colour 
options for upholstery 
and the introduction of 
new mirror ranges.

Current Trading and 
Outlook
There has been a decline in 
performance since the beginning 
of February, which we attribute to a 
general weakening in the consumer 
economy. For the 8 weeks to 
26 March 2011, like-for-like UK retail 
sales have decreased by 4.2%. We 
believe that our strong product 
offering and brand, robust balance 
sheet and continued operational 
efficiencies give us a sound base to 
face the tough outlook ahead.
The store portfolio realignment 
programme will continue in the UK. 
We aim to achieve the optimum 
balance between a profitable store 
portfolio and online retail. We will 
continue to develop our online 
presence through an improved and 
enhanced website which will give our 
customers a clear and enjoyable 
shopping experience. Our franchise 
business will maintain its current 
expansion programme as we develop 
partnerships in new territories. New 
licensing opportunities in high quality 
products will also be explored to 
improve the profitability of the 
Group.
Acknowledgements 
I wish to convey my sincere 
appreciation to the staff and 
management of the Group for their 
dedication and commitment as well 
as to my fellow Board members for 
their continuing support and counsel. 
I would also like to extend my 
heartfelt gratitude to our customers, 
suppliers and shareholders for their 
support, loyalty and confidence in 
the Group.
