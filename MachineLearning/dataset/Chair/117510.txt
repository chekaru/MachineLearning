UK Retail
As at 25 January 2014, the property 
portfolio in the UK comprised 209 
stores (2013: 212). We have five  
store types: 130 Mixed Product stores 
(selling all product categories), 50 
Home stores (selling Home products 
only), 24 Home concession stores,  
4 Gifts & Accessories stores and  
1 Clearance outlet.
During the year ended 25 January 
2014, we opened 2 new stores and 
closed 5 stores. As a result, total 
selling space fell by 2.0% to 786,000 
square feet. This reduction reflects 
our ongoing portfolio optimisation 
policy.
Our E-Commerce channel remains  
a key part of our multi-channel retail 
strategy, contributing 16.0% of total 
UK retail sales (14.0% of total Group 
sales). This participation is consistent 
with last year. Operating on both 
mobile and fixed line platforms, 
Laura Ashley delivers its full product

Product
The UK business is split into four 
main categories. For the financial 
year ended 25 January 2014,  
the relative split of UK sales is  
as follows: Furniture 30%, Home 
Accessories 29%, Decorating 23% 
and Fashion 18%.
Over 40% of our home furnishings 
sales are from products manufactured 
in the UK.
Furniture
The Furniture product category 
includes upholstered and cabinet 
furniture, beds and mirrors.
Total Furniture sales decreased by 
1.4% (LFL -0.8%) for the year ended 
25 January 2014.
In an extremely competitive category, 
we have increased the breadth of  
our offering in beds, upholstered  
and cabinet furniture and have had 
success with some of the newer 
ranges. We are now focussed on 
consolidating this success with the 
introduction of further updated 
pieces in our classic styles.  
We feel that the quality and design 
of our ranges in this category are 
unsurpassed in the market and we 
have continued to develop and 
improve both this year.
Home Accessories 
During the year ended 25 January 
2014, sales of Home Accessories 
increased by 0.8% (LFL +1.2%).
We are pleased that our Home 
Accessories offering has continued 
the growth of recent years. Our 
targeted range of gift products, 
co-ordinated bed linen, design led 
lighting ranges and soft furnishings 
have improved in quality, design  
and variety. These ranges have also 
proved particularly popular with our 
Franchise customers and will 
continue to expand.
Decorating
This category includes curtains, 
blinds, fabric, paint, decorative 
accessories and wall coverings.
During the year ended 25 January 
2014, Decorating sales were up by 
1.9% (LFL +2.2%).
The cornerstone of our home 
business, our decorating products, 
with their unique prints, colours and 
designs, continue to be well received 
by our customers. Significant growth 
in readymade curtains and paint, 
manufactured by Laura Ashley in the 
UK, has been behind much of the 
success in this category, while our 
inspirational wallpaper and fabric 
designs continue to evolve and 
enhance our co-ordinated home 
offering.  
These decorating product ranges 
have also helped to differentiate our 
Interior Design Service from the rest 
of the high street. This service has 
grown by 19% over the year.
Fashion
For the year ended 25 January 2014, 
UK retail Fashion sales decreased by 
6.5% (LFL -5.2%).
Following a disappointing like-for-like 
drop of 6.6% for the first half of 
2013/14, the second half improved 
significantly to a drop of 3.8% and, 
very encouragingly, there was like-for-
like growth of 1.5% for the fourth 
quarter. We feel confident that we 
have addressed the challenges faced 
during the past twelve months with 
our fashion collections and have a 
clearer understanding of what our 
customers demand in quality, price 
and style.

Franchise revenues 
grew by 4.2% 
to  28.2 million over 
the year.
International Operations
International business now accounts 
for 11% of total revenue.
Our international Franchising 
operations continue to be an 
important part of our business and, 
as at 25 January 2014, there were  
286 (2013: 266) Franchised stores in 
32 (2013: 28) territories worldwide. 
They now include stores in Armenia, 
Poland, Estonia and Qatar.  
Franchise revenues grew by 4.2%  
to  28.2 million over the year.
Licensing income decreased by  
21% to  3.3 million. This reduction 
primarily reflects one off promotional 
Licensing during 2012, not being 
repeated during 2013. Licenses  
were awarded during 2013 for new 
categories, which included branded 
kitchens and beauty products. 
Exeptional Items
A net gain of  1.2 million was 
recorded in the year. This reflects  
the gain on disposal of a short term 
investment, which was offset by the 
cost of store closures.
Hotel
The Hotel has now been refurbished 
and has officially been launched  
as a Laura Ashley boutique hotel.  
We expect the Hotel revenue to  
grow significantly this year.

Chairman's Statement continued
We will continue with 
the progress we have 
made in developing 
our brand, growing  
our product ranges, 
improving our systems 
and enhancing our 
online business.
Current Trading  
and Outlook
I am encouraged that, despite a 
challenging first half, we have seen 
good like-for-like sales growth during 
the second half. We will continue 
with the progress we have made in 
developing our brand, growing our 
product ranges, improving our 
systems and enhancing our online 
business. These initiatives, together 
with the growth of our international 
Franchise business, will remain our 
primary focus. 
The retail environment continues to 
be both competitive and challenging 
but we are confident that the quality 
of our product ranges, the enduring 
appeal of our great British brand and 
the loyalty of our many worldwide 
customers will enable us to make 
further progress in growing the 
business.
In the first two months of the current 
financial year, we have achieved like-
for-like sales growth of 2%. This is  
an encouraging start to the year  
and we believe that this progress  
can be maintained.
Acknowledgements
The success of the Group is due  
in no small part to the hard work  
and commitment of the staff, 
management and my fellow Board 
members. For this, I wish to convey 
my thanks and appreciation.
For their continued support and 
loyalty to the Group, I would like to 
thank our customers, shareholders 
and suppliers.
