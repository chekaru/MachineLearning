Chairman's statement
Summary
The Group has made significant progress
during the year, with revenues, profits,
margins and earnings per share all growing
strongly. Lavendon is firmly established as
the European market leader in the rental of
powered access equipment.
Whilst acknowledging buoyant market
conditions, this improvement in the
performance of the Group stems from the
development, in recent years, of a solid
operational base capable of delivering
enhanced financial performance from
organic investment, whilst at the same time,
making and integrating acquisitions, both in
the UK and overseas, to strengthen the
Group's market position, management pool
and operational scale. This approach has
enabled the Group's financial results to
improve, and also provided the necessary
management and operating infrastructure
to deliver further growth and enhanced
returns in the coming years.
The improvement in the trading
performance is also reflected in the Group's
cash flows, which continue to strengthen
and comfortably support the increased level
of indebtedness following the substantial
investment and acquisition programme
undertaken during the year. These strong
cash flows will continue to provide the
necessary financial flexibility to support the
Group's future development.
Financial results
Revenues for the year increased by 49% 
to  186.0 million (2006:  124.7 million),
with operating profits, prior to exceptional
costs, increasing to  28.7 million (2006:
 12.7 million) and margins improving to
15.4% (2006: 10.2%). Operating profits after
exceptional costs were  26.2 million 
(2006:  12.7 million) and margins were
14.1% (2006: 10.2%).
The exceptional costs of  2.5 million (2006:
 nil) relate to the integration costs incurred
on the merger of the Group's German
operations and the costs of merging the
Nationwide Access and Wizard businesses
in the UK.
Net interest costs increased to  7.2 million
(2006:  4.9 million) following the Group's
investment programme during the year,
which included four acquisitions. Whilst
interest costs increased, the improved
trading performance enabled the Group's
profit before tax and exceptional costs to
increase by  13.7 million to  21.4 million
(2006:  7.7 million). Profit before tax after
exceptional costs increased by 145% to
 18.9 million (2006:  7.7 million).
The effective tax rate for the year was 21%,
higher than the rate of 12% in 2006, but still
below the UK's headline rate of 30%, mainly
due to benefits available from tax losses in
the Group's European operations. Following
the charge for taxation, the Group's profit
after tax more than doubled to  15.1 million
(2006:  6.9 million). Earnings per share,
before exceptional costs, increased 133% 
to 42.11 pence (2006: 18.09 pence) despite
a 10% increase in the average number of
shares in issue. Earnings per share after
exceptional costs, almost doubled to 
36.10 pence (2006: 18.09 pence).
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation (EBITDA), before exceptional
costs, increased by 67% to  64.1 million
(2006:  38.3 million), with margins improving
to 34% (2006: 31%). After exceptional costs,
EBITDA increased by 61% to  61.6 million
(2006:  38.3 million), and margins improved
to 33% (2006: 31%). Cash generated from
operations increased by 58% to  58.5 million
(2006:  36.9 million) and after payment of
interest and taxation, net cash generated
from operating activities increased by 64%
to  48.6 million (2006:  29.6 million).
A total of  50.0 million was invested during
the year in the maintenance and expansion
of the Group's rental fleet and operating
infrastructure. In addition, four acquisitions
were completed for a total consideration 
of  77.2 million, satisfied with  64.2 million
in cash (paid or deferred) and  13.0 million
in shares. The combination of this
investment activity increased the Group's
net debt to  185.7 million at the year end
(2006:  99.0 million), with corresponding
debt to equity and debt to pre-exceptional
EBITDA ratios - which reflect the cost of
acquiring DK Rental in December 2007, but
little of the associated profits - of 156%
and 2.90 times respectively (2006: 105%
and 2.58 times respectively). The debt to
pre-exceptional EBITDA ratio calculated on
a pro-forma basis (assuming 12 months
EBITDA contribution from DK Rental) is 2.45
times, a small improvement over 2006.

These debt levels are well supported by the
Group's strong cash flows and significant
additional credit lines are available to
support the future growth of the business.
Dividend
Due to the considerable improvement in
the Group's financial performance, an
increased final dividend of 6.25 pence per
share is being proposed (2006: 3.00 pence),
making the total dividend for the year 9.00
pence per share, an increase of 100% over
2006 (2006: 4.50 pence). The final dividend,
if approved at the Company's Annual
General Meeting on 23 April 2008, will 
be paid on 6 May 2008 to shareholders on
the register at the close of business on 
25 March 2008.
Acquisitions
During the year, the Group completed three
acquisitions in the UK - Rise Hire Limited,
Wizard Workspace Limited and Higher
Platforms Group Limited - for an aggregate
consideration of  12.9 million, payable in
cash. The acquisition of Rise Hire Limited
enabled the Group to move into the fast-
growing market for the rental of van-
mounted platforms, whilst Higher Platforms
Group Limited offered an excellent addition
to the Group's network of more locally
focussed businesses. Wizard Workspace
Limited, due to its similar fleet and customer
mix, has been fully integrated into the UK's
largest operation, Nationwide Access. 
In December 2007, the Group completed
its largest acquisition to date, that of the DK
Rental group of companies, with operations
in Belgium, France and Spain. The total
consideration was  64.3 million, payable in
a combination of cash and shares. This
acquisition not only significantly strengthens
our existing market position and operational
capabilities in France and Spain, but also
enables the Group to enter the Belgian
powered access rental market as market
leader. As a consequence of this, and the
prior year acquisition of Gardemann, we
now have well established profitable
businesses and highly experienced
management teams in each of our European
markets, which represents a marked
development in the resilience of our Group.
We have also announced the proposed
acquisition of The Platform Company
(Holdings) Limited in the UK, for a total
consideration of  46.1 million, payable in a
combination of cash and shares. This
acquisition increases the scale of our UK
operation and offers considerable scope
for cost synergies. It will also provide an
opportunity for the Group to reduce its
planned capital expenditure requirements
for 2008, as the acquisition will deliver
significant additional fleet capacity.
Completion of this acquisition, subject to
shareholder approval, is expected by the
end of March 2008.
Summary
The main drivers behind the use of powered
access equipment - safety, efficiency and
cost effectiveness remain as compelling as
ever, underpinned by the ever-improving
awareness and adherence to the Work At
Height legislation which is present
throughout the European Union.
These market fundamentals have
contributed to the buoyant levels of demand
that the Group has enjoyed throughout the
year; particularly evident during the first
quarter of the year, where the mild winter
conditions did not suppress activity levels to
the extent traditionally experienced.
Through a combination of organic growth
and acquisitions, the Group has been able
to increase its revenues significantly during
this period and, through its operating
leverage, convert this revenue growth into
attractive incremental profit margins.
To support this rate of growth in the scale
of the business and to ensure that these
performance improvements are sustainable,
we have improved the depth and quality of
our management, through recruitment,
acquisition and internal development during
the year, as well as making the necessary
resources available to support further
development of our IT and operational
capabilities.
We believe that this process of building
scale through both organic investment and
acquisition, and then creating operational
leverage through sound business processes
Chairman's statement
continued
and management, can continue to provide
the necessary scope to deliver considerable
performance improvement. Having
increased our size significantly through a
number of acquisitions in the last 18
months, our focus will be on the integration
of these businesses, realising the benefits of
increased scale and delivering strong
shareholder returns.
Trading since the year-end is in line with our
expectations and whilst we are alert to the
current economic conditions, we have
experienced no noticeable impact on our
end user markets and are confident of
reporting further progress in the year ahead.
