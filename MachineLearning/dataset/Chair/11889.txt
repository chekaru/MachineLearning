 3 Annual Report 2010 | Anglo-Eastern Plantations Plc 
 
Chairman's Statement 
 
 
On behalf of the Board of Directors of Anglo-Eastern Plantations Plc, I am pleased to present to you the 2010 
Annual Report and Audited Financial Statements on the performance and operations of the Group and the 
Company for the year ended 31 December 2010. 
 
Financial Performance 
For the year ended 31 December 2010, revenue was $187.2 million, 25% higher than $150.1 million in 2009. This 
is due primarily to higher CPO price. The Group operating profit for 2010, before biological asset (BA ) adjustment 
was $64.9 million, 10% more than in 2009. Estates fresh fruit bunch (FFB ) output for 2010 was 3% lower than 
previous year. FFB bought in from surrounding smallholders for 2010 was 432,800mt (2009: 435,500mt), 1% lower 
compared to 2009. FFB production was affected by higher rainfall particularly in Bengkulu which interrupted the 
evacuation of FFB. With lower FFB processed, Crude Palm Oil (CPO ) production in 2010 was 204,600mt, 4% 
lower compared to 213,200mt in 2009.  
 
Profit before tax and after BA adjustment was $85.0 million, compared to $62.1 million in 2009. The BA adjustment 
was a credit of $18.4 million, compared to a credit of $0.9 million in 2009, reflecting higher estate valuations. 
Overall, the higher profit was attributed to a higher CPO price. The average CPO price for 2010 was  $892/mt, 31% 
higher than 2009 of $679/mt. 
 
Earnings per share before BA adjustment increased by 6% to 99.59cts, compared to 94.11cts in 2009. 
 
The Group s balance sheet remains strong. The Group continued to experience positive cash flow generation for 
2010, enabling it to build up cash reserves and reduce its borrowings. As at 31 December 2010, the Group had a 
cash position of $70.9 million and lower borrowings of $22.1 million, giving it a net cash position of $48.8 million, 
compared to $36.8 million in 2009.  
 
During the year, we repaid $4.9 million (2009: $8.6 million) out of our existing borrowings of $27.0 million (2009: 
$35.6 million). 
 
Corporate Development 
In 2010, we planted 7,580 hectares of oil palm mainly in Kalimantan, boosting our planted area by 16% to 52,000 
hectares (2009: 44,700 hectares). The Group plans to plant an additional 10,000 hectares per year for the next four 
years. 
 
The Sumindo mill (45 MT/hour) was commissioned in May 2010. Construction work to increase Blankahan mill 
processing capacity from 25 MT/hour to 40 MT/hour was started in December 2010 and is scheduled for 
completion by September 2011 at an estimated cost of $1.6 million. 
With over 5,500 hectares already planted in Kalimantan, with the first harvest expected in 1Q2012, an oil mill with 
an initial capacity of 60 MT/hour is also planned for PT Sawit Graha Manunggal (SGM ) for 2Q2011.  
 
Another mill is planned for North Sumatra for 3Q2011.

Chairman's Statement 
 
 
 
Directors 
Mr. Donald Han Low relinquished his position as Acting Chief Executive on 25 May 2010.  
 
The Board is pleased to announce the appointment of Dato  John Lim Ewe Chuan as Executive Director, Corporate 
Finance and Corporate Affairs, with effect from 1 September 2010. Prior to taking up this position, Dato  John Lim 
was the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company. He will be submitting himself for re-
appointment at the forthcoming annual general meeting. 
 
Mr. Chan Teik Huat has retired as Non-Executive Chairman as well as a Director of the Company with effect from 
31 January 2011.  
 
I have been appointed as Non-Executive Chairman of the Company with effect from 31 January 2011. I will be 
submitting myself for re-election at the same annual general meeting. Brief profiles of all Directors are set out on 
page 15 of this Annual Report. 
 
Corporate Social Responsibility 
Corporate social responsibility (CSR ) is an integral part of corporate self-regulation incorporated into our business 
model. Our Group embraces responsibility for the impact of its activities on the environment, consumers, 
employees, communities, stakeholders and all other members of the public sphere. In engaging the social 
dimension of CSR, the Group s business has taken cognizance of the contribution and further enrichment of its 
employees while continuing to make contributions to improve the well being of the surrounding community.  
 
We are in the preliminary stage of moving towards the RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) standards. 
This multinational multi-stakeholder organisation, founded by the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF ), is 
focused upon delivering certified sustainable palm oil to the world market through one of the world s most 
comprehensive certification programs for agricultural products. This initiative is focused on protecting and 
enhancing the principles of people, planet and profit for the benefit of all. RSPO principles are clearly stated under 
the Statement on Corporate Governance. 
 
The RSPO steering committee was established in December 2010 to work out a roadmap to support RSPO 
implementation at mills and estates. The steering committee is exploring green projects like generating electricity 
from empty fruit bunch and compost plants that meet RSPO principles and criteria for implementation. 
 
We also noted that Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO ) is legally mandatory for all plantations in Indonesia. 
By March 2012, ISPO will become the minimum standard for Indonesia planters.  
 
Care For The Environment 
As a Group, we equally highlight the importance of creating awareness and implementation of good environmental 
management practices throughout the organisation. The Group has been consistently practising good agricultural 
practices such as zero burning, integrated pest management, land terracing and recycling of biomass and reducing 
fossil fuel consumption. 
 
Outlook 
FFB production for two months to February 2011 was 20% higher against the same period in 2010. Although we 
have been spared extreme weather patterns so far this year, it is too early to forecast whether the production will 
be better for the rest of the year.

Chairman's Statement 
 
 
Outlook-continued 
The CIF (Cost, Insurance, Freight) Rotterdam CPO price opened the year 2011 at $1,195/mt and prices are 
expected to be in the range of $1,000/mt to $1,300/mt for 1H 2011. The fundamentals for palm oil price remain 
bright due to expectations of tighter supplies in 2011 and the growing dependence on palm oil to raise edible oil 
supplies. Various variances like weather, crude oil price, government policies and global liquidity influence CPO 
price movement. While it is difficult to forecast the CPO price in 2011, it should remain satisfactory. 
 
In Malaysia and Indonesia, it is generally expected that yields and productivity will pick up reasonably in 2011 due 
to increased maturing areas in Indonesia and a recovery from biological tree stress. Oil World forecasts global 
CPO production to rise 5.5% year on year in 2011, slightly higher than consumption growth of 5.3%. Demand for 
CPO is expected to be firm due to increased share of the vegetable oil market and making up for the shortfall 
production of other vegetable oil.  
 
The US dollar depreciated by approximately 4% (2009: 15%) against the Indonesian Rupiah during 2010. 
Indonesian Rupiah has not experienced adverse fluctuations against the US dollar in early 2011. We expect a 
stable currency exchange level to be attainable for the rest of the year. To mitigate the exposure to currency 
exchange volatility, the Group is managing its cash in dollar and local currencies prudently, taking into 
consideration its dollar-denominated borrowings and operational cost currency requirements. 
 
Prospects for 2011 should be cautiously optimistic in view of higher CPO price during 1Q2011 on the back of 
robust growth of emerging markets. The Chinese government efforts to curb rising food prices and inflation may 
potentially affect future demand and CPO price. Indonesia s domestic market continued to be resilient and remain 
unscathed from global uncertainties during 2010. The continued strength in domestic demand should be 
sustainable in 2011. The Company is aware of rising fertiliser costs and wages in Indonesia which is expected to 
increase the overall production cost in 2011. Recent increase in export tax on CPO in Indonesia to 25% is also 
expected to affect profit margin. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the Group is confident that CPO demand 
will be sustainable in view of global economic recovery and we can expect a satisfactory profit level and cash flow 
for 2011. 
 
Dividends 
The Board is mindful that the Group s development programme will require a considerable capital commitment. In 
this respect, the dividend level needs to be balanced against the planned capital expenditure. The Board is 
proposing to declare a final dividend of 5.0cts in respect of 2010 (2009: 5.0cts). The final dividend will be paid on 
28 June 2011 to those shareholders on the register on 27 May 2011. Shareholders choosing to receive their 
dividend in Sterling will do so at the rate ruling on 27 May 2011, when the register closes. Based on the exchange 
rate at 15 March 2011 of $1.6064/ , the proposed dividend would be equivalent to 3.1p, compared to 3.3p declared 
in respect of 2009. 
 
Acknowledgment 
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to convey our sincere thanks to our Directors, management and all 
employees of the Group for their dedication, loyalty, resourcefulness, commitment and contribution to the success 
of the Group. The year ahead will continue to be challenging given the turbulence of the global market. With similar 
commitment, perseverance and effort as exhibited in the past, I am confident we can deliver a good level of 
performance to all our shareholders. 
 
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the shareholders, business associates, government authorities 
and all other stakeholders for their continued confidence, understanding and support for the Group.
