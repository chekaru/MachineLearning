In 2004, the Outdoor advertising sector continued to outperform the
display advertising market with a growth rate of 7.8% over 2003. Other
display media also enjoyed better growth levels than in 2003 and overall
the total display media market, including outdoor, is estimated to have
grown by 5.5% compared to 2.3% in 2003. TV, Radio and National and
Regional Newspapers all grew by about 5%, with Business and Consumer
magazines growing at just over 3%. As a result of this growth, outdoor
advertising in 2004 enjoyed its highest-ever market share in recent years,
with an estimated 9.3% (2003: 9.0%) of total display advertising revenue
(according to the Outdoor Advertising Association).
FINANCIAL RESULTS
Maiden's turnover grew at a slower rate than the outdoor market generally with revenue
growth of 4.5% to  92.1 million (2003:  88.1 million), reflecting the slower growth in the
billboard advertising sector. Operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
costs improved 27% during the year to  9.4 million (2003:  7.4 million). This includes other
operating income of  2.8 million (2003:  1.2 million) of which  2.0 million (2003:  nil) was
as a result of compensation receivable in respect of the early termination of a number 
of contracts. Operating margins before amortisation and exceptional costs improved to
10.2% (2003: 8.4%).
Pre-tax profit on ordinary activities before amortisation and exceptional costs rose 
33% to  7.0 million (2003:  5.3 million). Group pre-tax profit was  0.9 million (2003: loss of
 0.1 million). Adjusted earnings per ordinary share were 8.0 pence (2003: 8.3 pence). 
The loss per ordinary share was 1.8 pence (2003: loss of 3.3 pence). 
The Board is recommending a maintained final dividend of 4.0 pence per ordinary
share, giving a total dividend for the year of 6.0 pence (2003: 6.0 pence), covered 1.3 times

(2003: 1.4) by adjusted earnings. The dividend will be paid on 31 May 2005 to those
shareholders on the register as at 29 April 2005.
The Group remained cash generative for the year with cashflow from operating activities
of  12.4 million (2003:  6.5 million). During the year the Group also raised  3.8 million, net
of costs, through a placing of 1.5 million new shares to support the Group's investment
programme, primarily in certain Train Operating Company (TOC) concessions which had
been successfully renewed. A new five-year  35 million debt facility was signed in
December, adding significantly to the financial flexibility of the Group.
During the year the Group invested  4.0 million (2003:  5.7 million) in improving and
adding to its advertising estate, and in enhancing its IT systems. 
Net debt for the Group at the year end was  34.4 million (2003:  39.6 million), with 
net interest covered 3.3 times (2003: 3.5 times) by operating profit before amortisation and
4.8 times by EBITDA (2003: 5.0 times). 
In March 2005, the Group successfully raised over  10 million net of costs from a 
2 for 19 rights issue at 210p per share, through which a further 5,033,433 new shares were
placed in the market. These funds will be used to implement the major capital expenditure
programme that results from our recent successful signing of new contracts within the rail
sector and maximise the potential of these concessions; invest in our billboard estate; and
provide further support for the successful retail advertising division. Some  7 million will be
split evenly between the transport and billboard advertising portfolios and  2 million on the
retail advertising estate. The balance will provide further financial flexibility for the Group.
ESTATE DEVELOPMENTS
By the end of 2004, the Maiden advertising estate had reduced to 27,645 panels 
(2003: 30,381). This was in part due to a deliberate reduction in the roadside estate 
to improve profitability and in part due to the loss of some smaller regional TOC franchises
to a rival.
The major focus during 2004 was the securing of the rail estate which substantially all
went out to tender during 2003 and, primarily, in 2004. By the year end, Maiden had re-
signed 89% of its estate by value. This included the Network Rail Managed Stations
contract, the largest and most valuable franchise in the rail estate, which was also
extended from seven to ten years. Capital expenditure on the rail estate was limited during
2004, due to delays relating to the renewal of key franchises, however the Group
continued to invest in its highly successful Transvision network, which was expanded to ten
screens during the year. A further three screens will be added in the Spring of 2005, at
three major stations in London (Fenchurch Street, Cannon Street, London Bridge) as well
as a screen to be installed at Liverpool Lime Street station later this year.
During the year Maiden also won a new contract for the selling and management of
promotional and exhibition spaces of concourses at 17 major stations.
In the roadside sector of the estate, the major emphasis was on improving profitability.
To this end a selective cull reduced the estate by approximately 700 48-sheet equivalents
and significant effort was made to reduce rents on the remaining panels wherever
practicable. This has made a significant impact on profitability in this sector and the work
is continuing into 2005. A further investment in backlit panels was made, with a further 
84 panels built during the year. chairman's statement

In our retail advertising estate our actions to focus on the major supermarket chains
proved very successful. While the estate reduced overall by 24% in panel numbers at the
end of December 2003, sales increased by 21% during 2004. The major change in
ownership during the year, with Safeway being taken over by Wm. Morrison, is an
opportunity for the Group to continue to improve the profile of this part of its estate as this
sector becomes more important to advertisers. The Morrison's acquisition, combined with
our expanded relationship with Asda, underpins the premium focus of Maiden's
supermarket proposition.
In shopping malls, the Group continued to win new contracts. Most significant of these
was the win of the Standard Life portfolio. The Group now controls rights in 102 shopping
malls (2003: 89) and continues to be the leading operator in the sector.
MARKET CONDITIONS
The prospects for the outdoor market remain robust for 2005. The strong outdoor market
fundamentals and on-going investment in new product innovation continue to deliver an
attractive value for money proposition to advertisers. Other display media continue to
suffer from audience fragmentation through the rapid expansion of media outlets. The
Outdoor Advertising Association is predicting that the medium will have a 9.6% share of
display advertising in the UK by the end of the year.
CURRENT TRADING AND PROSPECTS
In this context, 2005 has started well for Maiden with revenues for the first quarter ahead 
5% over the same period last year. Looking forward in 2005, the prospects of a General
Election in May add a degree of uncertainty to the prospects for the first half as advertisers
sometimes reduce brand advertising in the immediate pre-election period. 9

The accelerating investment in our rail estate and the recent restructuring and
expansion of the sales team should strongly enhance Maiden's rail revenue growth
throughout 2005.
Demand for Maiden's premier point-of-sale advertising estate continues to grow
strongly and we will be taking opportunities to expand this portfolio and secure key
contracts into the long term. 
Billboards continue to offer the most challenges to the Group, as they continue to
under-perform the other sectors where Maiden operates but they also offer a major
opportunity for margin improvement. Maiden will be focusing closely on implementing the
next stage of its programme of improving billboard operating performance and rekindling
advertiser interest through new product development and marketing initiatives.
The significant strategic successes achieved by the Group during 2004 have increased
operational gearing but have provided a strong competitive foundation for the business
moving into 2005 and beyond. The Group has the necessary financial resources to
implement in 2005 the final stages of the corporate strategy that was set in place in 2003.
The outdoor market seems set to grow and continue to take market share from other
media into the medium term and the Board believes that Maiden is well placed to
maximise any strategic opportunities that may arise.
