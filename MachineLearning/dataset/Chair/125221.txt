We work with our clients in the public and regulated sectors 
to design and deliver a wide range of essential front-line 
services that reach over 24 million people every day. Put 
simply, the services we deliver keep the country running.
All of our contracts are long-term and are delivered locally. 
This means that we have deep relationships with local 
communities and make a significant and sustainable 
contribution to the local economies where we work. 
Our strong local presence means that where we offer multiple 
services to multiple clients in one place then we can deliver 
them together, so that they're more effective and more 
efficient for everyone. And we translate the learning from one 
geography or service to another. This is the essence of our 
unique  place-based' approach to integrated service delivery.
Over the following six pages we describe the work we deliver 
for three local communities - in Torbay, Lincolnshire and  
Norfolk - as examples of our  place-based' approach.
