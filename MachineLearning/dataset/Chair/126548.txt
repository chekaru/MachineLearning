CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT 
 
Introduction 
 
The results for MediaZest plc (the Group ) for the 15 month period to 31 March 2010 incorporate the 
results of its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. 
 
Results for the Period and Key Performance Indicators 
 
Turnover for the period was  2,572,000 (2008 -  4,424,000), cost of sales was  1,451,000 (2008 - 
 2,846,000) and the Group made a loss for the period, after taxation, of  747,000 (2008 -  605,000) 
after paying interest of  32,000 (2008 -  7,000) and having paid administrative expenses of 
 1,836,000 (2008 -  2,176,000). 
 
The basic loss and diluted loss per share was 1 pence (2008 - 3 pence). The Group had cash in hand of 
 37,000 (2008 -  102,000) at the period end, and an invoice discounting facility over the debtors of 
Touch Vision of which  60,000 (2008 -  220,000) was in use at the period end date.  
 
As at 31 March 2010 the Group also had loans from shareholders of  290,000 (2008 -  85,000) and 
post year end the Group has repaid  60,000 of these loans and secured further loans from shareholders 
such that the current outstanding balance is  355,000.  
 
As at 31 March 2010, the Group has an unused overdraft facility through Touch Vision of up to 
 50,000 and a current maximum limit of  350,000 under the existing invoice discounting facility. Post 
period end the overdraft facility has been converted into a loan of  50,000 repayable over three years 
with the same bank. 
 
Overview 
 
After improving revenue growth in years 2007 and 2008 and posting a commensurate reduction in 
Group losses, 2009 was a difficult year. Turnover fell by over 40% and the general deterioration in the 
economic climate coupled with a contraction in business undertaken with several large clients had an 
impact on all markets in which the Group operated. Despite considerable reduction in the Group's cost 
base this inevitably led to a loss for the 15 month period, although in the second half of 2009 the 
Group was able to achieve an improvement in trading, indicating the early signs of a turnaround in the 
Group's activities and its efforts in rebuilding its revenue base. This is shown in the previous set of 
interim results to 31 December 2009. 
 
It had become clear during the fifteen month financial period ended 31 March 2010 that the Group was 
in need of further capital and needed to recapitalise its statement of financial position. Consequently, 
the Group raised  200,000 of equity investment in August 2009 followed by a further  324,000 in 
February 2010. Several parties became new and meaningful shareholders and also provided additional 
capital through the provision of loans to the Group. The injection of these new funds provided the 
catalyst for the restructuring of the Group with the objective of moving the Group into profitability in 
the current financial year.  
 
The timing of the second equity fundraising and the additional provision of credit facilities from 
certain shareholders meant that the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2009 was not 
reflective of progress made by the Group in the first quarter of the calendar year 2010 and therefore the 
Board took the decision to move the year end accounting date to 31 March, thereby creating a 15 
month financial period. This enabled the Group to present a more meaningful picture of the state of the 
Group's affairs which it believes is of more use to shareholders. Pursuant to the above, and after 
consultation with the Group's professional advisors, the Group issued a second set of interim 
statements for the six month period to 31 December 2009.

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT 
 
Trading strategy 
 
In the course of this restructuring phase the Group has pursued a policy of growing the percentage of 
revenue generated through retained and contractual business. The objective is to improve the quality of 
Group revenue by reducing the reliance on project based turnover with a longer term target of covering 
the entirety of the Group's cost base through contracted, repeat business. Although we haven't yet 
achieved this target, there has been good progress made to date with an increasing proportion of the 
Group's cost base now being defrayed in this way. 
 
The Board believes that the majority of work in reducing the Group's cost base has now been 
accomplished. The way ahead is to get more revenue out of the business by increasing our customer 
base and gaining new revenue streams by tailoring our offering to client needs given the changed 
economic climate that we now live in. Three new additions to the team have been made since January 
2010, which in part replaced departed personnel, with others under consideration. Two of these 
individuals have been recruited for their experience in their specific markets and bring significant 
existing client relationships with them which we expect to lead to further benefits in the second half of 
2010. 
 
Our product range has also been re-appraised and retooled to target better value for money solutions, 
albeit perhaps not as creative as our most imaginative installations but more in tune with client budgets 
during this time. We have also sought innovative ways to price and cost our solutions, particularly in 
the area of temporary campaigns in retail stores, in order to match customer budgetary expectations 
whilst maintaining our gross margins. 
 
 
MediaZest Ventures 
 
The company has been dependent, largely, upon higher profile marketing budgets which have been 
reduced dramatically in 2009 and, therefore, MediaZest Ventures revenues have been particularly hard 
hit during the recession. It has been clear that whilst clients continued to engage with us, to a large 
degree they failed to commission projects in any meaningful way during 2009. Although this business 
was not, as a rule, lost to competitors, very often client spending was reduced significantly. 
 
However, we have continued to market to our strengths and have provided ever more creative and 
innovative solutions and it was pleasing for the company to pick up its first major industry award in 
2009, in recognition of the highly creative and innovative solutions it provided to O2 over the 
preceding 12 months. The Board is now cautiously optimistic that the company can increase business 
in its areas of expertise as client budgets are re-instated during 2010. It is notable that from the 
beginning of February 2010, incoming enquiries have increased dramatically and long term 
opportunities developed over the course of 2009 have started to come to fruition. 
 
In the longer term the type of opportunities generated by the technologies MediaZest employs are 
where we believe significant shareholder value can be generated. With the upturn in marketing spend 
coming through the market, we are now engaged with several client projects that have the potential to 
generate large revenues for the Group and propel it to substantial profitability. In the interim we 
continue to work hard to generate sufficient day to day revenue to provide a profitable base from 
which to develop these larger scale opportunities.

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT 
 
Touch Vision 
 
2009 was a reasonable year for the company's Education division, albeit less noteworthy than the 
preceding year. Due to our strong reputation for quality project delivery, we were able to win and 
install two significant projects of approximately  200,000 each during the period. However, overall 
sales in this sector were down year on year as Universities' budgets were cut and large scale 
investment projects were not implemented.  
 
The company's retail sector clients, similar to MediaZest Ventures' customers, continued to engage 
with us but failed to spend in line with previous years. Again, client attrition and margin performance 
were not issues for the company but absolute project spend was because being reliant on discretionary 
budgets this type of business tends to be vulnerable. 
 
The Corporate market was particularly affected by the recession and competition in this area became 
intense. The company was still able to pick up some good work early in the year but during the second 
half, as opportunities dwindled in the sector, it was forced to rationalise its activities in this division 
and await an upturn in the market. 
 
Outlook 
 
As stated earlier, enquiries in the retail sector have begun to increase since the beginning of 2010 and 
this has started to translate into improved revenues for the Group in the first few months of the new 
financial period. We are now working on several opportunities which have the potential of 
transforming the turnover and performance of the Group, should any of these be consummated within 
the coming months. 
 
On a more cautious note financing remains tight, although much improved upon the position twelve 
months ago. It is apparent that the contraction in both the availability and pricing of credit is having an 
affect on many smaller and medium sized enterprises. Given that the Board is now at a stage of 
looking to move the business forward by building on the restructuring that has been implemented in 
the last fifteen months it is intending to examine and consider various sources of funding to achieve 
this end and build value in the Group. 
 
The Group's financial performance for the beginning of 2010 - 2011 financial year is better than it has 
ever been and it hopes to be able to announce results that are markedly improved when our next 
interim announcement is made.
