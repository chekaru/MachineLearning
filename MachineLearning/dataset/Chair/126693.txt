Significant and exciting progress 
towards our objectives
As your board we recognise that it is 
our duty to create shareholder value.  
As a pharmaceutical development 
company, MMI's business model is to 
identify world-class medical research 
that has the potential to treat unmet 
need in major therapeutic markets,  
markets such as cancer and infection. 
Developing those technologies to the 
human proof-of-principle stage and 
ultimately licensing them to major 
pharmaceutical marketing partners.   
Last year, I said in my report, The 
prospects for the coming year are 
the most exciting in the Company's 
history . We have not been 
disappointed and I am delighted to 
report that during the past year our 
portfolio of therapeutic products 
continued both to grow and to 
progress towards and through the 
clinic, adding significant value for 
shareholders and attracting global 
pharmaceutical company interest.
Strong and progressive pipeline 
development
We reported the first clinical trial 
results for our Genvax lymphoma 
vaccine and other Genvax clinical 
trials for myeloma and prostate 
cancer are underway and progressing 
well.  We showed in laboratory tests 
that our Oncosense portfolio of 
ruthenium anti-cancer drugs is more 
effective and safer than the market-
leading drugs based on platinum.  
We demonstrated that the Viratis 
novel anti-viral ribozymes appear to 
be effective against hepatitis as well 
as AIDS and we added to the Viratis 
portfolio in the fields of rheumatoid 
arthritis and asthma.  In addition to 
technical and clinical progress, we 
also saw six further patents being 
granted during the year.  
Taken together, all these successes 
mean that we have a strong and 
competitive pipeline of therapeutics, 
several of which have the potential 
to be blockbuster drugs.   We 
also expanded our relationships 
with academia, thus providing an 
enhanced ability to secure more 
exciting technologies.  These facts 
have been recognised by a number 
of potential marketing partners, 
including a number of the world's top 
pharmaceutical companies.
Heightened market interest

private, also began to recognise the 
value in MMI's pipeline. Between 
31st March 2004 and 31st March 
2005 the share price grew by 287%, 
outperforming both the AIM (26% 
increase) and pharmaceutical (0% 
change) benchmarks.  During the 
same period, the value of your 
company grew from  29 million to 
 120 million.  Measured against our 
objectives, I am satisfied that we had 
a good year.  Nevertheless, there is 
still a considerable way to go until the 
significant potential of the Company 
is realised.  Further clinical trials and 
licensing agreements should have an 
impact on this valuation.
Funding the development
The planned progress with our 
pharmaceutical pipeline meant that 
research and development costs 
increased by 31% over the previous 
year and patent costs rose by 414%.  
In addition to these largely external 
costs, these developments placed a 
considerable extra workload on the 
MMI team, which was increased in 
size, resulting overall in an increase 
in underlying administrative expenses 
of 11%.  During the year we took 
back sub-let space in our Bioscience 
Innovation Centre and fitted out three 
additional laboratories that were 
required primarily to carry out the 
development work on the ruthenium 
and pineapple protease cancer 
therapies.  These plans, which were 
announced in the previous year, led to 
an expected reduction in rental income 
of 65%. However, by allowing other 
companies to use surplus capacity in 
our laboratories under our LabHotel 
trademark, we were able to generate 
income to help offset these costs and 
we were also able to contract with six 
global-leading equipment suppliers 
who have provided us with their latest 
ranges that we can use free of charge 
for our own developments and which 
we can allow other companies to 
use on a fee basis. Tek-check our 
technology audit product for academic 
institutions also provided us with 
income as well as being a source of 
new technologies for our portfolio. 
Genvax, for example, was a direct 
result of our technology audit work for 
the National Blood Service.  
Although the main focus and value-
driver of MMI is the development 
of our pharmaceutical pipeline, fee 
income from LabHotel and our due 
diligence service Tek-check, together 
increased by 49% and, as well as

being strategically relevant, helped to 
maintain the low cost of our business 
model. There was no Tek-check due 
diligence income from the BioScience 
VCT in the second half of this year, and 
the outcome of recent changes to the 
board of the Fund may have an impact 
on future due diligence workload.  
We are monitoring this situation  
closely.  Overall, turnover remained at 
2004 levels.
Operating losses for the year are down 
by 17%.  The loss in the previous 
year took into account the  589,710 
impairment of our CellFactors 
investment, in which MMI had a 17% 
stake, after that company was placed in 
administration. The administrators have 
now liquidated CellFactors, but after 
their costs, it is unlikely that there will be 
a significant distribution to shareholders.  
We have learnt from the CellFactors 
lesson and MMI now funds the activities 
of all its subsidiaries. This enables us to 
increase our equity stake, and maintain 
a much greater level of control over the 
activities of these subsidiaries than was 
possible with CellFactors.  
With the continuing support of our 
major institutional shareholders, we 
ended the year with a 49% increase in 
cash reserves and remained debt-free. 
Following the year end I am pleased to 
report that existing and new institutional 
shareholders have indicated their 
willingness to support our ambitious 
development programme.  Details of 
this will be announced separately.
Cancer and HIV - unmet need  
on a global scale
Although there has been much 
scientific progress in recent years, 
cancer remains the most common 
form of premature death in the western 
world, affecting one in three, and 
killing one in four. Worldwide, over 40 
million people are now infected with 
AIDS and there are some 300 million 
chronic sufferers from hepatitis B. 
There is clearly much more to be done 
and during the coming year we expect 
to see more of our cancer therapies 
enter or complete clinical trials. The 
results of these trials may influence 
both pharmaceutical company interest 
and the valuation of the Company. We 
also hope to be able to make further 
progress across other aspects of the 
portfolio with our potential therapies, 
especially those for AIDS and hepatitis 
in the near term and with those for 
rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and drug-
resistant infections in the medium-term.

A strengthening board and 
shareholder base
In anticipation of MMI becoming a 
much more valuable player in the 
pharmaceutical sector, we significantly 
increased the number of presentations 
of the MMI story to financial institutions 
and this led to a strengthening of 
our shareholder base. We also took 
steps to strengthen the board of 
directors and Dr James Brenton (41), 
a consultant cancer specialist and 
Cancer Research UK Senior Clinical 
Research Fellow was appointed 
Medical Advisor and is due to join the 
board as part-time Medical Director at 
the AGM.  James is highly experienced 
in running clinical trials with platinum-
based cancer therapies and his 
expertise will be invaluable with our 
ruthenium clinical trials.  Rob Sprawson 
(35) will also join the board at the AGM 
as full-time Group Finance Director 
replacing John Hustler (59) who has 
been part time Finance Director since 
2000.  In addition to his accountancy 
experience, Rob has nearly a decade 
of experience in financial transactions 
in the technology sector and this skill 
will be extremely useful in our licensing 
negotiations with major pharmaceutical 
companies. I look forward to introducing 
the new board members to you at 
the AGM and I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank John Hustler for 
helping to get us to where we are now, 
and also to wish him well for the future.
There are two groups of people without 
whose support the significant progress 
we made during the year would not 
have been possible. Firstly, I thank the 
team of hard-working professionals 
in MMI who know that they are not 
only enhancing shareholder value but 
are also intent on making an impact 
on the treatment of serious diseases.  
Secondly, and most importantly, we 
all recognise that our progress is 
dependent on the continuing support 
of existing shareholders and the 
additional support from new ones. On 
behalf of the whole MMI team, I thank 
all shareholders and I look forward with 
them to seeing the full potential of MMI 
being realised as we stand poised on 
the edge of a new era for the Company.
