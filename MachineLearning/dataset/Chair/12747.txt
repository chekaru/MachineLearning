 Chairman's Statement
The Group achieved a strong operational performance 
during 2009 and, as a result of its strong asset base 
and sound financial position, has been able to continue 
its growth strategy without interruption in spite of the 
economic and financial pressures during the year. 
All three of the Group's business divisions performed well. Group copper 
production at the mining division was 442,500 tonnes, which was ahead of 
the original forecast for the year of 433,000 tonnes. Molybdenum production 
at Los Pelambres was 7 ,800 tonnes, in line with 2008. The transport and 
water divisions both achieved increased volumes. The Group's net earnings 
in 2009 were US$667 .7 million compared with US$842.9 million in 2008 
(excluding exceptional items in 2008). The decrease mainly reflects the 
expected reduction in copper volumes and lower molybdenum market prices 
in 2009. The Group's already strong financial position was further improved 
through the raising of US$1.8 billion in two major financings at Esperanza 
and Los Pelambres. At 31 December 2009 the Group's net cash balance 
was US$1,595.7 million.
Strategy
The mining division has achieved considerable progress in line with its 
strategic plan, which was established in 2008. The first pillar of the strategy 
is to secure and strengthen the core business of the Group. During 2009 
the plant expansion at Los Pelambres was substantially completed, with the 
increased plant throughput level of 175,000 tonnes per day expected to be 
reached during the second quarter of 2010. Esperanza expects to complete 
construction and start commissioning of its new mine by the end of 2010. 
The second strategic pillar is to grow this core business by further developing 
the areas around its existing asset base. The Group's primary focus remains 
the Sierra Gorda district, which provides a range of excellent opportunities 
for growth in the medium and longer term. The Group intends in the medium 
term to assess how best to utilise the large resource base at Los Pelambres. 
Near Michilla, a feasibility study is in progress at the Antucoya deposit. 
The final element of the strategy is to develop and search for additional 
opportunities including early stage growth in copper both in Chile and 
abroad. At Reko Diq the feasibility study and the environmental and social 
impact assessment study are in their final stages. Discussions with the 
relevant authorities remain in progress, as agreements concerning a mining 
lease and mineral agreement have not yet been reached. During 2009 the 
Group has entered into a number of early-stage exploration agreements 
to further develop its portfolio of international exploration prospects. 
In January 2010 it also entered into an agreement to acquire an interest 
in the Nokomis deposit in the United States. 
Sustainable development
The Group recognises that achieving its strategic plan depends on effective 
management of social and environmental issues, and during 2009 the 
mining division approved a social and environmental strategy which is integral 
to its business plan. This sets out the Group's objective to create economic, 
social and environmental value as a participant of the mining sector. 
It is founded on the principle that managing sustainability performance 
is key to maintaining the Group's social licence to operate and grow.

Health and safety
The Board deeply regrets the death of five of its workforce who lost their 
lives during the year at the Group's mining operations. The Board has a 
clear target of zero fatalities and considers any fatality to be unacceptable. 
Each incident was investigated by the relevant authorities and the Group, 
and we have taken action to prevent a recurrence. 
Health and safety is one of the Group's key priorities and work to improve 
performance will continue over the year. The Group's lost time injury 
frequency rate improved in 2009 to an average of 2.8 injuries per million 
hours worked, from 4.4 in the previous year. 
Dividends
The Board recommends a final dividend for 2009 of 20.0 cents per ordinary 
share, comprising an ordinary dividend of 6.0 cents and a special dividend 
of 14.0 cents. The final dividend amounts to US$197 .2 million, and if 
approved at the Annual General Meeting will be paid on 10 June 2010. 
Including the interim dividend which was paid on 8 October 2009 this gives 
total dividends for the year of 23.4 cents per ordinary share, amounting 
to US$230.7 million and representing a distribution of 35% of 2009 net 
earnings. This is the same payout ratio as in 2008, when the total dividends 
of 60.0 cents in part reflected the exceptional profits realised in that year.  
As we have previously stated, our policy is to establish an ordinary dividend 
which can be maintained or progressively increased and to pay special 
dividends when appropriate, taking into account the profit earned, 
the Group's cash position and expected funding commitments. 
The Board believes this year's dividend payment combines the Group's 
desire to continue to return cash to shareholders with the ability to 
develop the Group's existing growth portfolio and to take advantage 
of opportunities that may arise.
Recent events and outlook
Despite its severity and the very serious impact on parts of the country, 
the recent major earthquake in Chile of 27 February 2010 is not expected 
to have any material impact on the Group's existing operations, and none 
of our employees or contractors has suffered any injury at our sites as 
a result. However, some employees and many contractors at the Los 
Pelambres and Esperanza projects have families in the affected areas, and 
we have assisted them in temporarily returning home. There has also been 
some impact on power facilities for the expanded capacity at Los Pelambres 
and the supply of some steel structures for Esperanza which are fabricated 
in the damaged zone in the south of Chile. As a result, the commissioning 
of the Los Pelambres plant expansion is now expected to be completed  
in the second quarter of 2010, while the commissioning of Esperanza is 
expected to start by the end of the year. The earthquake has clearly caused 
great loss to some of our stakeholders in the country and we are working 
with them to provide support.
In January 2010 Sebasti n Pi era was elected as the new president 
of Chile and will take office on 11 March. While this represents a change  
from the coalition which has governed since 1990, Chile is expected 
to remain both one of the most financially and politically stable countries 
in South America, and also one of the most favourable countries in which  
to conduct mining operations.
The near-term outlook for copper has improved significantly compared with 
early 2009, although prices could still remain volatile. Over the medium term 
the outlook for copper is positive, with the potential for significant supply side 
pressures over the forthcoming years.

Overview
4   Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009   For 2010, Group copper production from the existing three operations 
is expected to increase by approximately 23% to 543,000 tonnes, mainly 
as a result of the completion of the plant expansion at Los Pelambres. 
Molybdenum production at Los Pelambres is expected to be 9,500 
tonnes compared with 7 ,800 tonnes in 2009, again due to the increased 
plant throughput as a result of the expansion. With the commissioning  
of Esperanza expected to start by the end of 2010, Group copper  
production in 2011 is expected to be over 700,000 tonnes.
The Group's sizeable exploration prospects in Chile, together with 
its increasing portfolio of international exploration projects, could provide    
further opportunities for long-term growth. The Group intends to use  
its sound financial position to continue to advance its existing assets  
and properties while continuing to seek opportunities globally to  
secure further world-class mining assets.

executives of the Group's three divisions - Marcelo Awad in the mining 
division, Miguel Sep lveda at the transport business and Marco K tulas  
in the water division - have between them a wealth of experience both  
with the Group and in their respective industries. I would like to take this 
opportunity on behalf of the Board to thank them and all our staff for the 
commitment they have shown during a very challenging year, and for 
helping to ensure that the Group is well positioned for ongoing growth.
