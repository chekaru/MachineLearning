C  profit before tax has risen 22.9% 
to  10.1 million (2006:  8.2 million); 
C  adjusted profit before tax and amortisation 
increasing from  9.5 million* to  10.8 million, 
a rise of 13.7%; 
C  basic earnings per share of 15.26 pence 
(2006: 14.72 pence**); and
C  Group net Assets have increased from 
 45.3 million to  50.0 million.
*  2006 profit before tax of  8.3 million has been 
adjusted by adding back bank and interest finance 
costs of  1.2 million which related to the corporate 
structure prior to the flotation.
**  2006 basic earnings per share calculations are 
affected by the distortion in the weighted average 
number of shares caused by the three month 
period of 2006 prior to the flotation. Calculated 
on the pro forma basis of the weighted average 
number of shares used in the 2007 calculation 
the 2006 figure would be 12.73 pence.
These results reflect a combination of solid 
organic growth and a modest contribution 
from acquisitions. during the year the Group 
successfully completed four acquisitions, 
collectively in the period these contributed 
5.5% of Group revenues.
Dividends
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 
3.9 pence per share (2006: 3.0 pence) giving 
a total dividend for the year of 5.8 pence per 
share (2006: 4.5 pence), an increase of 28.9% 
on the previous year. This increase reflects the 
higher earnings and the Board's confidence that 
the Group is well placed to continue to develop 
and grow. The final dividend will be paid on 
29 May 2008 to shareholders on the register 
at 2 May 2008.
Strategy
Morson's strategy is to focus on organic 
growth through the expansion of business 
development initiatives and to augment 
this growth through selective acquisitions 
in certain key strategic areas particularly 
in complementary sectors and geographies. 
As our position in the market grows we continue 
to focus on our margins. Morson Projects higher 
margin consultancy services and targeted 
Group business development are all critical 
components of this margin focus. 
in all our selected markets there is a trend 
amongst clients towards placing contracts 
with fewer suppliers and for longer periods 
of time. This benefits major suppliers such as 
Morson allowing the delivery of efficient and 
cost effective integrated solutions. As industry 
consolidation continues, through both horizontal 
and vertical market integration, Morson will 
progressively extend the range of solutions 
that we can offer, through joint ventures, 
partnership or acquisition. 
We continue to invest in our business 
development team, which has grown 
by three key people over the last year, 
to deliver and develop this strategy. 
Acquisitions
during 2007 we made four acquisitions, 
White & Nunn Holdings Limited (WNH ) 
and Pentagon Personnel Limited (Pentagon) 
in f ebruary 2007, Commissioning and 
technical services Limited (Cts  ) in April 2007 
and Rosta engineering Company Limited 
(Rosta) in November 2007 for an aggregate 
consideration of  6.9 million. Collectively 
during 2007 these acquisitions contributed 
some  21.9 million of revenue and  2.8 million 
of Nfi.  06

Outlook
The unique positioning of Morson, the mix 
and diversity of our service offering and broad 
exposure to the multi-disciplined technical 
and engineering sectors on which we focus 
ensures that we are not significantly exposed 
to the economic uncertainties arising from 
the current turmoil in global financial markets. 
With our specialist Morson Projects division 
the Group has the capability and versatility 
to offer our clients alternative project delivery 
solutions within a broad range of design and 
engineering fields. This positions Morson 
favourably to take advantage of opportunities 
for long-term growth in both existing and new 
markets. A significant part of our business is 
with large private and public sector organisations 
operating on major long-term infrastructure 
investments for which funding is in place 
and committed.
Morson's outlook for 2008 is positive, 
the board is forecasting continued sustainable 
growth. o ur successes in 2007 and the progress 
during early 2008 mean that the ingredients 
for a successful year are already in place. 
o ur markets continue to generate opportunities 
and our sales prospects are exciting. The Board 
therefore looks forward to the current year 
with confidence.
