 The Group results for the year ended 26th February 2005 show significant progress 
has been made in the profit recovery of the core home shopping business, 
reflecting the major focus on margins and new growth areas over the past two 
years. In the continuing tough trading conditions, which have affected the whole 
retailing industry, this division, which accounts for over 90% of total revenues, 
increased operating profits by 13.6% on turnover up 0.9%.
A program to rationalise and restructure our other businesses will be completed by the 
autumn. Impairment costs of  25.5m have been provided to effect these changes with 
positive benefits for group profitability going forward.
Overall group turnover is down by 2.2% at  460.3m but operating profit before operating 
exceptional items is up from  54.2m to  54.4m. Pre-tax profit is  18.6m (2004,  31.0m) after 
accounting for higher interest charges, joint venture losses and impairment provisions.
The borrowings have reduced to  126.2m during the year with a net cash inflow before 
financing of  19.3m generated by a significant reduction in both the working capital and 
capital expenditure requirements.

This results in gearing of 52% (2004, 60%) on net 
assets of  243.3m and interest cover before operating 
exceptional items of 6.5 times. The Board is 
recommending maintaining the dividend at 5.84p, 
covered 1.9 times before operating exceptional items.
HOME SHOPPING
Core home shopping results, excluding House of 
Stirling and Teleview which are covered separately 
below, show a significant operating profit 
improvement, up 13.6% at  59.2m (2004,  52.2m)  
on turnover up 0.9% to  416.5m. This reflects the 
concerted management action which has resulted  
in a 1.3% gross margin rate improvement and a cost 
reduction programme which has reduced selling and 
administration costs by over  4m.
Our home shopping strategy is to focus on specific 
customer and product niches, with particular 
specialism in larger sizes and/or the over forty-five 
customer. Whilst turnover growth has been modest  
we have shown considerable success in certain key 
product categories. Overall sales of ladieswear were 
level with last year despite strong deflation in the 
market place, and within this sales of corsetry and 
lingerie were up by 9%. Footwear was our strongest 
performing range with sales up 13%.
 
The total turnover for home and leisure products was, 
as expected, slightly down at  116m. The tighter 
credit controls, introduced to improve profitability, 
had the predicted impact on slowing sales of the 
higher value furniture and electrical lines. This was 
offset by the launch of a new Christmas Gifts 
catalogue which resulted in a greater contribution 
from toys, gifts and decorations.
Sales grew in all three of our customer age groups.  
Within the younger titles (30-45 age group) Fashion World 
remains the dominant catalogue but the fastest growing 
brand is still Simply Be, where sales grew by 18%. 
The main mid-life group of catalogues targeted at the 
45-65 age group rose by 1% to  293m including sales 
from the House of Bath database we acquired in 
November 2004. Once this business is fully integrated 
we will use it as a platform to increase sales from the 
ABC1 socio-demographic groups, where the market  
is growing strongly. 
Sales to the older customers (65 plus) rose by 2%  
to  22m with good performances from Heather Valley 
and Special Collection. 
Our emphasis on customer recruitment has been  
to improve the quality rather than the quantity of our 
database. We discontinued the Value Catalogue and 
Home Essentials on grounds of low profitability, which 
contributed to a 3% decline in customer numbers. The 
higher quality customer base, together with improved 
targeting and catalogue content, resulted in the 
average sales per customer rising by 4%.
Our channels to market continue to evolve. Internet 
penetration has increased to 11% of total sales, 
reflecting growth of over 60% to  44m. We plan to 
increase this further by both promoting this channel  
 to our existing customers and building new on-line 
brands. For example, Viva La Diva.com has been 
launched and is aimed at a new audience, offering  
a range of high street and designer footwear brands  
in addition to our own range of wide fitting footwear. 
In late autumn we launched the Express Shopping 
Channel on the main digital television channels in 
partnership with Northern and Shell. Our share of 
losses was  1.9m as planned, including set up costs.
The gross margin has improved by 1.3% to 56.6% 
through a combination of reduced bad debts, following 
the tightening of credit limits, and a deliberate move  
to reduce the level of discounting.
As we outlined at the interim results, we have 
embarked on a focused cost reduction campaign, 
including using on-line auction techniques to improve 
purchase prices and, where necessary, restructuring 
business processes. This has yielded savings of  4m  
in the current year.
HOUSE OF STIRLING
The recovery plan implemented for House of Stirling, 
our door-to-door selling operation, has delivered the 
expected reduction in losses in the second half. The 
underlying results for the year show sales of  24m, 
down 27.5%, and pre-exceptional operating losses  
of  6.3m (2004,  2.0m). 
We have undertaken a fundamental review of the 
business and are taking radical action to stem the 
losses, resulting in an impairment charge of  22.5m. 
This is shown separately as an operational 
exceptional item.
TELEVIEW
The disposal process for our television rental operation 
has been protracted. We are in negotiations with 
interested parties and hope to conclude a deal shortly. 
The operating result was break-even compared with  
a  1.2m pre-exceptional operating profit last year.
FINANCIAL SERVICES
We have been making personal loans to our customers 
since 2001. After a thorough review of the prospects 
for this business we have decided to offer these 
products only as an intermediary, for which we receive 
guaranteed commission. 
The existing loan portfolio of  19m will be collected 
out by our own debt collection team but we anticipate 
a shortfall of  3m, including costs, which has been 
taken as an operating exceptional item. The pre-
exceptional operating profit in the division was  1.2m 
(2004,  2.4m). 
FULFILMENT SERVICES
An operating profit before operating exceptional  
items of  0.3m has been achieved against  0.8m  
last year. The interactive services activity was closed 
down in July 2004 and the focus is now clearly on 
more profitable fulfilment contracts, helping retailers  
to establish their on-line and catalogue channels. 
We are working on a solid pipeline of opportunities, 
and fulfilment contracts have now been signed with 
Woolworths and more recently JJB Sports. The rapid 
growth of multi-channel retailing continues to provide 
exciting opportunities for Zendor.
BOARD
Jim Martin, currently non-executive Deputy Chairman 
and distinguished former Chief Executive, has indicated 
his intention to retire from the board at our Annual 
General Meeting in July. Jim has served 31 years  
with the company, during which it has grown from  
a market capitalisation of only  4m, much of it due  
to his outstanding retailing skills, as well as sheer hard 
work. We thank Jim for his enormous contribution  
to the company over many years and wish him well.
PROSPECTS & OUTLOOK
Despite the reported weakening of general customer 
demand in recent months, we have seen some 
encouraging signs in current trading. Sales in our core 
home shopping business for the 10 weeks since the 
year end are running 5% ahead of last year, 3% of 
which is contributed by House of Bath customers. 
However in the light of recent announcements in the 
sector we remain cautious in our outlook for both  
sales and gross margin.
The restructuring program for our non-core activities 
will be completed by the autumn, resulting in a 
significant improvement in the rate of return on 
capital employed. 
Overall we are delighted that the many profit 
improvement initiatives we have put in place in the core 
business are starting to deliver positive results. Sales in 
many of our key product categories are advancing and 
we have improved both the gross margin and the cost 
base, with a further limited net benefit to come in the 
current year. 
The fact that this has been achieved in a very 
competitive retail market, confirms our confidence in 
the program we are now pursuing. Whilst there is more 
progress to be made, the hard work of management 
and staff is starting to be rewarded.
