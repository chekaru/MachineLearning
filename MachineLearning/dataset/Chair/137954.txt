2013 Operational Highlights 
Maritime:
       Maintained our market share of the maritime liquid waste business in Gibraltar despite the lack of our own
onshore facility.
       Following negotiations throughout 2013 we finally reached the  1.35m insurance settlement in March
2014 to cover material damage and business interruption following the Gibraltar accident recognised as
a Post Balance Sheet Event.
Oil & Gas:
       Commissioned a further 5 Compact Treatment Units (CTUs) - 2 of which were sold to a third party.
       In response to client demand, developed a specialist Sludge Treatment Unit (STU) and the second such
unit is close to build completion.
       2 CTUs now operating in challenging conditions in Tanzania and Norwegian Arctic Circle.
Engineering:
       Awarded contract to supply a maritime liquid waste treatment plant to the new Port of Sohar in Oman
likely to contribute in 2015.
       Substantially completed the supply and build of a hydrocarbon waste treatment plant for the MOD in an
overseas territory as a subcontractor to Interserve Defence Ltd.
I am very pleased to announce the 2013 results for Nature Group PLC which reflect the good progress that
has been achieved in all 3 divisions - Maritime, Oil & Gas and Engineering. There have been challenges faced
in the Maritime Division as we invested to meet changes in legislation, and delays in bringing operations in
Gibraltar back online.  However, with planning approval and the resolution of our insurance claim we can now
look forward to operations in the future with confidence.
2013 has been a year in which we have laid down the groundwork for our continued transformation into an
international and innovative business. We have made good progress in terms of bringing Gibraltar back on line,
reacted well to legislative changes and the performance of our Oil & Gas and Engineering divisions have been
encouraging.

After a strong first half, we did, however, experience a more challenging second half of 2013, primarily as a
result of two factors. Firstly, the Maritime Division which continued to suffer from a lack of permanent port
storage and treatment facilities in Gibraltar and also experienced the additional charter hire costs of the new
chemical barges which could not be passed on to our customers.  Secondly, in the Oil & Gas Division, the time
necessary to secure new contracts from the point at which these are first identified was longer than expected
due to the logistical issues for our customers in mobilising drilling rigs. Our forecasting for such contracts has
been amended as appropriate. The Chief Executive's statement will cover these issues and other operational
factors in more detail.
The Board also took the strategic decision to write off approximately  12.9m of goodwill, which arose from the
acquisition of International Slop Disposal B.V in 2010 in order to ensure that the Consolidated Balance Sheet
more accurately reflects the net asset value of the Group as at year end. The detail of this non-cash technical
adjustment is covered in the Chief Financial Officer's statement.
In the 2012 Chairman's Statement, we highlighted that a resolution of the issues surrounding the accident in
Gibraltar in 2011 would be a high priority.  In July 2013, the Government of Gibraltar gave us the green light to
initiate the first stage of restarting operations and we submitted a planning application to rebuild the storage
tank area.  Whilst the rapport with the Planning Committee was positive, the timescales were extended by the
need to prepare and submit an Environmental Impact Assessment, which achieved the right outcome when
final approval for storage only was received on 10 April 2014. Our recommendation to establish a Liaison
Committee to monitor our activities is likely to be adopted and we anticipate an early agenda item will be to
seek agreement to initiate treatment, after the storage area of the plant has been rebuilt and commissioned
which is anticipated to take 12 months.
In addition, we had maintained that the repudiation of our insurance claim for the Gibraltar accident by our
underwriters was not justified. With the support of our loss adjusters, Aon, we challenged this decision and
demonstrated that we had a legitimate claim, which culminated in the recently announced settlement of  1.35m
to contribute towards our material damage and business interruption losses. We are now considering possible
recourse actions against third parties in respect of the recovery shortfall.
Following a review of our 2013 performance, we have identified a number of initiatives aimed at the continued
strengthening and improvement of the business in 2014 and beyond. At the Board level, we are actively looking
to appoint additional non-executive directors with relevant experience to support the executive management
team and help guide the strategic development of the Company. Our decision to restructure the Company in
October 2013 into three clear divisions, being Maritime, Oil & Gas and Engineering has already improved
business focus. As part of the process we have started to strengthen the Executive management team with
the recent appointment of an experienced Port Operations Manager to lead the Maritime Division, and a new
General Manager to head up operations in Gibraltar.
Nature is now well positioned not only to ensure that we can provide our customers with services that are fully
compliant with environmental and waste disposal regulation but also to exploit the operational benefits that
future regulation will bring. Whilst 2013 undoubtedly required commitments that were fundamental to the
positioning of our divisional operations, we have used this opportunity to establish a platform from which we
can seek new opportunities in related activities and deliver shareholder value.
Nature Group's future is strongly linked to establishing growth through a series of international development
projects. The current pipeline of developments includes; establishing a port reception facility joint venture at
Sohar in Oman, investments in Houston following the recent acquisition on 1 April 2014, and reconstruction of
the Gibraltar facility. In the Oil & Gas Division, developments include continuous improvements to the Compact
Treatment Units (CTUs), new Sludge Treatment Units (STUs), and research into new slop treatment chemicals.
This is a full and intensive programme, and we are excited by the opportunities each project offers. We have
also identified the need for a Senior Project Manager to ensure that our projects are delivered on time and to
budget.
Further steps we have taken to establish building blocks for the future include full accreditation in 2013 for ISO
9001 and 14001 for efficiency, quality and environmental compliance.  Also, we were very pleased that we were
able to appoint Cenkos this year as our Nomad and Broker who more accurately represent our business
portfolio and strategic objectives.

As Chairman, I travel regularly to our operations in Europe and further afield, including Houston, and I genuinely
recognise and am proud of Nature Group as a  can do' business, well-illustrated by our Engineering Division in
taking on projects in Duqm Oman, and an overseas territory for the MOD where the working conditions can
best be described as both climatically challenging and remote from their base in Cornwall. I value the help,
support and commitment our executives give to Nature for which I thank them. 
Finally, none of our plans could be achieved without the support of our shareholders and we are pleased to be
able to announce that we intend to pay a dividend of 25% of distributable profits* in line with our Dividend Policy.
Therefore, we are recommending a dividend of 0.28p per share which will be formally proposed at the AGM.
