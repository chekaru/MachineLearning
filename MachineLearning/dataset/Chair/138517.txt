 2 Nestor Healthcare Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2003
Chairman's Statement
In 2003, we have seen
important changes in both 
the NHS hospital environment
and the Primary Care
marketplace in which 
we operate.
John Rennocks
Chairman
2003 has been a challenging year for Nestor.
In addition to managing major internal
projects, we have seen important changes
in both the NHS hospital environment and
the Primary Care marketplace in which 
we operate, and we also dealt with the
unsolicited approach to acquire the Group.
Despite this, our results for 2003 are in
line with the expectations described to
shareholders in December. 
Summary of results
2003 2002 ( m)
( m) (Restated) 
Statutory results
Turnover 423.2 482.7
Profit before tax 13.6 8.1
Earnings per share 10.51p 2.33p
Business performance
Profit before tax 24.7 33.1
Earnings per share 23.17p 29.90p 
Statutory results are stated after goodwill
amortisation and exceptional charges 
of  8.4m (2002:  7.6m) and  2.7m
(2002:  17.3m) respectively. Business
performance results, which are used
throughout this statement, exclude
goodwill amortisation and exceptional
charges and reflect the manner in which
the business is monitored.
Business performance profit before tax for
the year ended 31 December 2003 was
 24.7m, compared to  33.1m in the
previous year, which benefited from a
contribution of  11.8m from the MAP
contract, which ended in 2002. Earnings per
share of 23.2p (2002:  29.9p) benefited
from a lower tax charge for the year of
18% (2002: 21%) following the legal
restructuring completed in 2002. This
benefit has now ceased and the ongoing
tax charge is expected to increase to
approximately 30%.
Cash flow from operations totalled
 25.0m (2002:  54.1m) as tight controls
on working capital were maintained. The
combination of the acquisition programme
spend of  29.5m and gross capital
expenditure of  9.9m, largely associated
with Primecare Primary Care's Clinical
Response Centres, led to an increase in
borrowings to  89.3m at the end of the
year (2002:  59.8m), comfortably within
the Group's facilities.
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final
dividend per share of 6.14p making total
dividends per share for the year of 9.62p,
unchanged from the previous year. 
Summary of performance
Personnel Division
Despite challenging trading conditions the
Personnel Division achieved excellent results:
  Turnover  299.3m (2002:  309.7m);
  Operating profit increased 28% to
 29.4m (2002:  22.9m);
  Operating margin 9.8% (2002: 7.4%).
Businesses acquired in 2002 and 2003
contributed turnover of  36.6m (2002:
 3.9m) and operating profit of  7.5m
(2002:  0.8m). In addition to the effect of
acquisitions, the improved operating margin
reflects not only the loss of a number of
low margin, high volume NHS contracts,
but also the benefits of tight cost control
and the positive impact of BNA's project to
reduce transaction costs and administration
workload. This project was completed on
schedule and will now be extended to the
Grosvenor branch network.
Services Division
The division achieved much in 2003 in
creating the platform for growth in out-of-
hours services to patients of GP practices
through the consolidation of call centres
into two new Clinical Response Centres.
However, whilst the strategic position of
the business has been significantly 3 Nestor Healthcare Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2003
enhanced during the year, the scale and
complexity of the migration to the two
Clinical Response Centres undermined the
financial performance in 2003:
  Turnover  123.9m (2002:  173.0m);
  Operating loss  0.6m (2002: profit
 14.4m).
The division's result in 2002 benefited
from a profit contribution after central
costs of  11.8m (on turnover of  47.9m)
from the MAP contract. As announced 
at the Interim results stage, profits in
2003 were enhanced by the release of 
a  0.8m balance sheet provision
established at the end of 2002 in respect
of the MAP contract. 
Acquisitions
Acquisitions of homecare providers and
businesses providing specialist services are a
key part of the strategic development of the
Group. In 2003, we completed twenty-six
acquisitions, at a total cost of up to  37.9m,
of which up to  6.75m is deferred and we
intend to continue the programme in 2004.
Clinical Governance
Under the leadership of Dr Bill Holmes, the
Group Medical Director, we continue to
develop our policies for identifying and
managing clinical risk. This process is
overseen by a separate Clinical Advisory
Board comprising a number of eminent,
independent healthcare practitioners.
Significant issues are reported to the main
Board on a regular basis. The time and
effort involved in monitoring our
performance represents a significant cost
to the business, but we consider the
information generated to be an important
tool in controlling clinical risk, and
ensuring we satisfy our statutory and
regulatory responsibilities. We believe
shareholder value is enhanced by meeting
these important criteria with the extent
and quality of our processes far exceeding
the norm for our marketplace. 
Unsolicited offer
In early July 2003, the Board announced
the receipt of an unsolicited offer for the
Group. The process, which was terminated
on 26th September 2003, was conducted
thoroughly and properly under the
stewardship of a Committee of the Board
with advice from N M Rothschild and our
brokers UBS, but did not result in the
receipt of an offer which the Board
believed represented fair value for
shareholders. Management time and effort
involved in servicing the process was very
significant, and costs of  0.4m incurred
with external advisors are included in
2003's result. 
Board changes
There have been a number of changes in
the composition of the Board during 2003
and since the year-end. The appointment
of Martyn Ellis as Group Finance Director
on 1st May was noted in the Chairman's
statement in last year's report.
When I was appointed Chairman of
Nestor in October 2003, I replaced 
Antony Beevor. Since then Tim Harris and
David Howell have resigned and Robert
Nicholls has retired from the Board. The
Board thanks each of them for their
contribution to Nestor through a period 
of significant change. 
In January 2004 the appointment of two
new independent non-executive directors,
Sir Andrew Foster and Roger Dye, was
announced.
Sir Andrew Foster served as Chief
Executive of the Audit Commission for

Chairman's Statement continued
England & Wales between 1992 and
2003. He was previously Deputy Chief
Executive of the NHS and a Director of
Social Services. Sir Andrew will act as
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director
and Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee and has also joined the 
Audit and Nominations Committees.
Roger Dye, a chartered accountant, has
been Finance Director of the Davis Service
Group since August 2000. Roger has
extensive experience on the Boards of
public companies, having been Finance
Director of four plcs since 1987. In
addition to serving on the Remuneration
and Nominations Committees, he will also
be Chairman of the Audit Committee.
These appointments provide the Board
with the correct balance of expertise and
experience to direct the business and to
ensure the appropriate standard of
governance. 
Staff
Last year saw changes for many employees
of the Group as major projects were
undertaken to reshape our operations in
response to market demands. In addition
all staff were subject to the uncertainty
caused by the unsolicited offer, which
overshadowed the business for much of
the summer. Despite this the professionalism
and enthusiasm demonstrated by our staff
was unflagging and remains an essential
asset to the Group. We are also an
organisation charged with the provision 
of the highest standards of care both
towards patients and clients. The dedication
and concern shown by all our staff lies at
the heart of our business and is central to
its future.
Outlook
In the Personnel Division we will continue
our development programme to grow our
Homecare business. This reduces our
dependency on the NHS as the significant
changes being effected cause us to be
cautious about our medium term
prospects in this marketplace. 
The challenge in the Services Division is to
convert the excellent strategic position of
Primecare Primary Care into a satisfactory
financial return. The long-term prospects
are clear, and whilst we expect to make
progress in 2004, that progress will be
influenced by the pace of transition of 
our customer base from GPs to PCTs.
