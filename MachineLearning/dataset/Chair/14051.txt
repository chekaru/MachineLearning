 First trial gold pour.
Michael Spriggs
Chairman
We take pride in the fact that we 
continue to deliver what we have 
promised; and during the past 
year we have emphatically met 
each of our stated objectives. 
Ariana's gold and silver resource 
base has been expanded 
substantially (25%) to almost 
450,000 oz gold equivalent.  
Our Red Rabbit Project is on 
course to become the next new 
Turkish gold producer during 
2012; the European Goldfields  
JV exploration programme  
in north-eastern Turkey is 
producing exciting results and 
our partners continue to support 
the further funding of these 
exploration programmes. 
In western Turkey , where we 
have a regional exploration 
programme, our focus continues  
to be the WAVE (Western Anatolian 
Volcanic and Extensional) 
province, considered one of the 
most highly prospective areas for 
major gold deposits in Turkey. 
Supporting the extensive regional 
work carried out here by our  
own geological team, we continue 
aggressively to seek suitable 
acquisitions in this province. 
 
We have set running the hare 
that is Red Rabbit. We created 
this integrated project in 2009 
with the decision to combine our 
two principal projects in western 
Turkey , Kiziltepe and Tav an,  
into a single entity. In July 2010  
we successfully negotiated  
a JV agreement for its phased 
development with Turkish 
construction company Proccea. 
Ariana received a US$500,000 
goodwill payment up-front from 
Proccea. Proccea can earn into 
a 50% stake in the JV company 
for a commitment of US$8m. 
The Definitive Feasibility Study 
(DFS) and Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA) were formally 
initiated in September 2010.
In the first phase of the Red 
Rabbit Project, the EIA, DFS  
and additional permit acquisition 
will account for US$1.4m; in  
the second phase, expected  
to initiate in the last quarter  
of 2011, US$6.6m will be spent 
on plant construction and mine 
commissioning. The total capital 
cost of bringing Red Rabbit 
into production is projected at 
US$25m. With our JV partners 
we are seeking to secure the 
additional US$17m funding 
requirement through debt 
financing, and are in discussions 
with potential Turkish and 
international funding sources.
The scoping study on Red  
Rabbit, completed by consultants 
Wardrop Engineering, envisages 
a seven-year open-pit project 
at Kiziltepe with a throughput 
of 150,000 tonnes/year ore 
producing an average of 20,000 
oz/year gold equivalent, coming 
into operation in 2012. This will 
be developed around a central 
pit on the Arzu South vein, with 
secondary pits at the nearby  
Arzu North, Banu, Derya and 
Kepez veins. Given the increase in 
our understanding of the deposits 
and the additions to resources 
through recently completed 
drilling, as well as the changes 
to bullion prices, the parameters 
of the project in terms of overall 
profitability , scale and mine life 
should continue to improve as 
development proceeds. 
Exploration at Kiziltepe  
has continued and further 
resource expansion achieved. 
The completion of a reverse 
circulation drilling programme 
on the satellite veins in the 
Kiziltepe system has resulted 
in an upgrade of the existing 
inferred resources to the 
indicated category. In October 
2010 we reported a 25%  
increase in Ariana's JORC 
compliant resource for Kiziltepe 
to 232,900 oz gold equivalent 
(i.e., combining the gold content 
with the value of the silver 
co-product). Significantly , the 
total measured and indicated 
component of resources 
increased to 206,500 oz  
gold equivalent. Also, all of  
the measured resources lie 
within the notional pit shapes 
defined at US$800/oz gold  
and US$14/oz silver .
The economics of this project 
appear highly robust: the initial 
modelling was based on very 
conservative price assumptions 
(as outlined above), and projected 
The period to end-December 
2010 has been an energetic and 
successful period for Ariana 
Resources. As I underlined 
in my report last year, Ariana 
has established a clear three-
pronged strategy around 
which we intend to build our 
operations in Turkey: advancing 
to production our Red Rabbit 
gold-silver project; the Joint 
Venture (JV) with European 
Goldfields; and the broader 
regional exploration programme 
supported by the active search 
for acquisition opportunities.
Chairman's statement
During the past year we have emphatically  
met each of our stated objectives.

Annual Report & Accounts 2010   Ariana Resources PLC cash costs of US$441-472/oz.  
By the time of writing in early  
May 2011, the gold price had 
reached new highs of over 
US$1,535/oz. In recent months 
the silver price has responded  
in the same buoyant manner ,  
and has risen to US$48/oz. 
To reflect changed market 
movements and expectations  
in both metals, the Red Rabbit 
pre-feasibility study , expected 
to be completed in Q2 2011, 
is therefore incorporating 
significantly higher base price 
assumptions. The inflationary 
pressures which are boosting 
these bullion prices, together  
with the impact of higher oil 
prices and other material costs 
undoubtedly will also push up 
anticipated costs. Nevertheless, 
the key parameters of Kiziltepe 
are expected to remain very 
attractive in terms of cash flow 
generation and pay-back period. 
Meanwhile, Proccea are working 
with SGS Minerals Services in 
finalising the metallurgical test 
work to optimise processing plant 
design. The expected treatment 
route will be a conventional 
Carbon-in-Leach process.  
In parallel, in December 2010 
we commenced geotechnical 
and hydrological drilling in 
preparation for the siting of  
the open pits, processing plant, 
waste dump and tailings dam.
Tav an, the other component of 
Red Rabbit, though very different 
in character from Kiziltepe, forms 
an integral part of the project. 
To date, a JORC compliant 
resource of 215,000 oz gold 
equivalent has been outlined. 
Tav an is lower grade than 
Kiziltepe, and a relatively shallow 
deposit. A preliminary economic 
assessment has indicated its 
viability as an open pit heap- 
leach operation with a potential 
output of up to 30,000 oz/year 
gold. The intention is to develop 
Tav an in sequence, once output 
from Kiziltepe has peaked.
The European Goldfields JV 
project continues to yield very 
encouraging results. Following 
initial reconnaissance exploration 
in this region of north-eastern 
Turkey , the JV acquired the 
licence containing the Salinba  
prospect on which a phased 
programme of drilling continued 
during 2010. Work in this area 
led to the identification of wide 
high-grade zones in trenching 
and drilling. Drilling and further 
surface work will continue  
during 2011.
Throughout Turkey we retain 
a substantial gold licence 
portfolio, including seven 
drill-stage prospects. While 
Ariana's principal exploration 
and development focus remains 
in western and north-eastern 
Turkey , the Company has 
additionally made a strategic 
investment in private company 
Tigris Resources, an exploration 
vehicle which will provide Ariana 
with access to a number of 
attractive gold-copper properties 
in south-eastern Turkey , a 
highly prospective but much 
underexplored region. Via a 
C$115,000 private placement  
in 2010, Ariana acquired a  
15% stake in Tigris and our 
Managing Director , Dr . Kerim 
Sener , has been appointed as 
a non-executive director to the 
Tigris board.
The Tigris placing funds will  
be used to tender for the next 
round of exploration licences 
which we expect to be announced 
this year . This move is in part  
a consequence of a number  
of revisions to the Turkish  
mining law which were enacted  
in June 2010. While we regard 
these changes overall as positive 
in providing a more robust 
legislative framework, they  
will result in modifications to 
the manner in which exploration 
and operating licences are 
issued and maintained. For a 
more detailed account of all of 
these exploration programmes 
and of the development of Red 
Rabbit, I would refer you to the 
comprehensive Business Review 
by Dr . Kerim Sener . 
Post the reporting period,  
there have been two important 
funding developments for  
Ariana. In January we concluded 
a  5m Standby Equity Distribution 
Agreement (SEDA) via US-based 
Yorkville Advisors LLC. The  
SEDA is a draw-down facility  
that will provide the Company 
with a means of raising additional 
capital as and when required 
through the sale of new shares  
in Ariana to Yorkville. The timing 
of any sales is at our discretion, 
and will depend on various factors 
including the Ariana share price.
In February , we successfully 
completed a  1.16m funding  
with the placing of 24.5 million 
new shares at 4.75p per share. 
These funds, together with the 
SEDA facility , will provide the 
additional flexibility to enable  
us to move quickly on exploration 
and development opportunities 
meeting our stringent investment 
criteria. We are therefore well 
placed to advance our exploration 
strategy in the coming year , 
currently holding cash resources 
of  1.57m.
With a robust and burgeoning 
economy , strong financial 
structure and an effective and 
supportive mining law, Turkey 
remains one of the region's 
most attractive destinations 
for modern precious metals 
exploration. Ariana is indeed 
fortunate in having such a 
strong local presence, a deep 
accumulated understanding of 
the prospectivity of key areas of 
interest and such close familiarity 
with Turkish mining business 
practice. We thank our local team 
for their tireless enthusiasm 
and commitment to Ariana's 
exploration success. I am also 
extremely grateful for the support 
of my fellow directors: Ariana 
is fortunate to have on board 
professionals of such high calibre. 
For the continuing backing  
shown by our shareholders, 
large and small, we remain 
enormously appreciative. We 
recognise that market conditions 
over the past year have tested 
this support on occasion and 
are deeply appreciative of their 
patient loyalty.
To end on a very positive note,  
our share price performance  
has improved fairly steadily  
in recent months, and with  
a gratifying increase in liquidity.  
As the consensus view is that the 
gold price strength will continue 
as long as global economic and 
financial uncertainties prevail, 
Ariana has established a more 
solid market platform as the 
Company advances towards  
gold production and towards 
its goal of becoming a mid-tier 
multi-project gold company. 
I look forward to keeping you 
fully informed of developments 
during what I expect will be 
another exciting year for Ariana 
Resources. We are in the right 
place, with the right commodity. 
And we deliver .
