 1,070,000 compared with a loss of  38,000 in the previous year. The loss after tax, pre-minority interests, was

Executive search revenue of  5,639,000 (2012:  6,673,000) reflects a fall of 15.7 per cent. in UK executive search
revenues to  5,409,000 from  6,413,000 in 2012 and an increase of 18.6 per cent. in overseas executive search
revenues to  230,000 from  194,000 in 2012. The reduction in UK executive search revenues reflected a reduction in
fee generating headcount during the year, but with higher profitability.

Loss for the year (1,152) (115)
EPS - basic (7.85p) (1.16p)
EPS - adjusted (7.40p) (0.52p)
*Includes Interim in 2012
The executive search operating loss for the period included a UK executive search operating profit of  141,000 
(2012:  114,000). Overseas executive search operating losses amounted to  289,000 (2012: nil). The overseas
executive search operating losses reflected  208,000 of operating losses in Singapore and the USA (2012: nil) and
 81,000 to the French office (2012: nil).
Assessment, coaching and talent management revenues grew by 95 per cent. to  1,144,000 (2012:  586,000)
reflecting a full 12 month performance of our Belgium subsidiary Norman Broadbent SPRL (2012: 2 months) and
broadly flat UK Assessment, coaching and talent management revenues. The operating loss of  86,000 
(2012:  115,000 loss) reflected profitable operations in Belgium and a loss in the UK as the business was repositioned
following the death of its founder in late 2012. The UK business, under the leadership of Carole Bodell, now has a high
quality product range and is attracting exciting new clients. 
AGP (previously known as Arcus Global Partners) and Connecting Corporates, the two new subsidiary businesses
established in early 2013 and late 2012 respectively, have between them generated  556,000 in revenue 
(2012:  36,000) and as anticipated generated start-up losses totalling  640,000 (2012: Profit  3,000), reflecting inter
alia the accelerated hiring of key personnel.
Revenue from overseas royalties totalled  212,000 (2012:  339,000), a decline of 37 per cent. as a result of the difficult
trading conditions experienced by licensees in Italy and the Middle East.

Corporate developments
The Company has invested substantially in AGP and Connecting Corporates, both of which have now built strong
teams and are creating promising revenue streams from quality corporate clients. We anticipate that both businesses,
while absorbing resources in the short term, will become profitable during the year. 
Since year end, your Company has streamlined its international operations, refocussing on our core executive search
and leadership consulting businesses in the UK and USA, and AGP and Connecting Corporates. 
The Board has sold Norman Broadbent SPRL, our 51 per cent. owned Belgian subsidiary to existing management. The
Company has been rebranded to Executive Talent Development. We wish Michel Debeock and his colleagues every
success for the future. Further, following discussions with our colleagues in Norman Broadbent Spain (in which we hold
a 20 per cent. equity interest) we have mutually agreed to end our license agreement and sell our 20 per cent. holding
to the other existing shareholders. We wish Krista Walochik, Chairman, and her colleagues every success in their 
re-branded independent business.
Finally, in March 2014 the Board terminated the Norman Broadbent executive search and leadership consulting licenses
in Italy and the Middle East /North Africa both on a mutually agreed basis. The decision reflected the de-minimus
revenues arising from these licenses and offices due to local market conditions, and in the case of the Middle East/
North Africa a significant downsizing of its executive search team. 
This refocusing has provided the Board with the opportunity to review how best to enhance the value of the Norman
Broadbent brand and IP internationally.
Share Placing
In October 2013, the Group raised  700,000 ( 684,000 net of expenses) through the issue, principally to existing
institutional investors, of 1,750,000 new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company at a price of 40 pence per share
(the October Subscription ).
The proceeds are being utilised primarily to accelerate the growth of AGP and Connecting Corporates.
Financial position
The consolidated Group statement of financial position was strengthened through the October subscription. As at 
31 December 2013, consolidated net assets were  2,800,000, compared to  3,221,000 as at 31 December 2013.
Group net current assets decreased to  762,000 (2012:  1,091,000). Group cash amounted to  579,000 
(2012:  1,009,000).
Net cash outflow from operations in 2013 was  732,000 (2012:  250,000) with  640,000 of these funds reflecting the
start-up losses arising from the development of Arcus and Connecting Corporates. Net cash inflow from financing
activities amounted to  521,000 (2012:  959,000) relating primarily to the net funds received from the October
Subscription. 
At 31 December 2013, the only exposure to bank borrowings was the Group's revolving invoice discounting facility, and
funds drawn down against this facility were  802,000 (2012:  965,000) against UK trade receivables of  1,255,000
(2012:  1,450,000).

Appointment of Group Chief Operating Officer and staff
James Webber, our new CFO, joined the management team in early March 2014 enabling a smooth handover from
Ben Felton who, as previously announced, resigned with effect from 30 March 2014 to take up a position at a larger
organisation. We thank Ben for his role over the past five years and wish him every success in his new role. In addition
to being CFO, James has now been appointed by the Board to Group Chief Operating Officer with immediate effect
James brings extensive experience in business services to Norman Broadbent, having worked in the office of the 
COO of EY, and has a background in corporate finance at a senior level. 
The expanded Group now comprises 80 people in the UK and your Board would like to express its thanks to all our
management teams and staff, particularly in view of the diversification programme taking place through our new
complementary subsidiaries.
Current trading
Trading in January and February 2014 in UK executive search was strong whilst March 2014 was disappointing. Overall,
Group revenues in the first quarter of 2014 were marginally ahead of the same period last year. For the second quarter
to 30 June 2014 the UK executive search team anticipates an encouraging performance based on activity to date and
the current strong pipeline, and our start up bespoke contingency, and digital start-ups are contributing to growing
revenues in a satisfactory way.
