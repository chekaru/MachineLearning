 04	 NORTHBRIDGE	 INDUSTRIAL	 SERVICES	 PLC		 ANNUAL	 REPORT	 AND	 ACCOUNTS	 2007
Chairman's	 and	 Chief	 Executive's	 review
We are delighted to present our 
review of the first full year of 
trading since the admission to 
AIM of Northbridge in March 
2006.
Crestchic Limited, our main 
subsidiary continues strongly 
and has traded at a record level 
in 2007. Total sales were up 26% 
compared with the previous 
year. This excellent performance 
was spread across the whole of 
the company's activities.
Crestchic designs, manufactures, 
sells and hires load bank 
equipment which is primarily 
used for the commissioning and 
maintenance of independent 
power sources such as diesel 
generators and gas turbines. The 
need to continually test and 
maintain standby and 
independent power systems, 
and the increasing reliance on 
power critical technology used 
within the banking, medical, 
marine and defence industries, 
has all resulted in a strong 
demand for Crestchic's range of 
services. Additionally Crestchic is 
benefiting from a background of 
an increasingly unavailable 
power infrastructure.
In March 2007 we were able to 
strengthen Crestchic's market 
position by the acquisition of the 
trade and assets of Loadbank 
Hire Services, a competitor in the 
London area, for a total cost of 
 909,000. The additional

equipment, staff and premises 
have given us better access to 
our customers and markets in 
the south east of England.
During the year Northbridge 
(Middle East) FZE (NME ) was 
incorporated in the Jebel Ali Free 
Zone of Dubai. This wholly 
owned subsidiary will focus on 
the needs of the oil and gas 
industries of the Middle East and 
Caspian regions. In September 
NME acquired a 51% 
shareholding in RDS (Technical) 
Ltd (RDS ) for  650,000. RDS is a 
Jersey registered company with 
a branch office in Azerbaijan 
whose principal business is to 
provide generators and 
associated equipment to the oil 
and gas industries in the Caspian 
Region.
Both of our acquisitions in 2007 
have made a positive 
contribution towards profits this 
year and are expected to make 
good contributions over the full 
year in 2008.
fINANCIAL	PER f ORm ANCE
Northbridge's consolidated 
revenue for the year to 31 
December 2007 was up over 
62%  1 1.2 million (2006:  6.9 
million), gross profit and net 
profit before tax were both up 
strongly at  5.6 million (2006: 
 3.3 million) and  1.6 million 
(2006:  1.1 million) respectively. 
Operating cash flow for the year 
was  1.3 million (2006:  0.9 
million). The comparative figures 
were for a nine month period of 
trading only as the Group's first 
subsidiary was acquired on 
26 March 2006, concurrent with 
the company being traded on 
AIM. Net Assets at 31 December 
2007 were  8.3 million (2006: 
 7.2 million) and the Group had 
gearing, defined as the ratio of 
all short- and long-term 
borrowings and other financial 
liabilities to net assets, of 23% 
(2006: 12%) at the year end. The 
net cash balance at the year end 
was  1.1 million (2006:  1.1 
million).
Fixed asset investment in 
expanding the hire fleet was 
 0.6 million (2006:  0.6 million) 
and the acquisitions of LHS and 
RDS added a further  1.1 million 
to hire fleet assets. 
The underlying performance at 
Crestchic Limited for the whole 
year showed an improvement in 
sales of 26% to  10.9 million 
(2006:  8.7 million). The 
contribution from Loadbank Hire 
Services since acquisition in 
March 2007 has been included 
in these figures as its trade and 
assets are no longer 
distinguishable from those of 
Crestchic itself.
RDS contributed total revenue of 
 319,000 in the three month 
period since acquisition together 
with an operating profit of 
 121,000. The Net Assets of RDS 
at 31 December 2007 were  1.8 
million including  1.0 million of 
cash. 
Based on this performance, the 
Board is pleased to propose the 
payment of a final dividend for 
2007 of 2.0 pence per share 
(2006: 2.0 pence) resulting in 
total dividends for the year of 
3.0 pence (2006: 2.0 pence) per 
share, a 50% increase The final 
dividend will be paid on 27 May 
2008 to shareholders on the 
register on the 21 April 2008, 
subject to shareholder approval 
at the Annual General Meeting 
to be held at 12 noon on 14 May 
2008 at the offices of Buchanan 
Communications, 45 Moorfields, 
London EC2Y 9AE.
BUSINESS	 REVIEW
During the year the company 
continued to experience strong 
sales demand from two of its 
main overseas markets, the 
United States and South East 
Asia. Rental demand was also 
strong and large projects were 
successfully completed in South 
America, The Caspian Region 
and Europe.
The previously outlined factory 
extension and the mezzanine 
floor completed in the first half 
of the year have added to our 
production capacity. We have 
been able to take advantage of 
this to increase sales during the 
second half and build additional 
units for our hire fleet. 	 	 NORTHBRIDGE	 INDUSTRIAL	 SERVICES	 PLC		 ANNUAL	 REPORT	 AND	 ACCOUNTS	 2007	 05

The acquisition of Loadbank Hire 
Services (LHS ) in March has also 
enhanced our hire fleet and 
strengthens our position in the 
London area. LHS was a division 
of TGC International Ltd and 
offers similar services to those of 
Crestchic Ltd. Pro-forma 
unaudited turnover and profit 
before interest and taxation for 
the year ended 31 March 2006 
were approximately  635,000 
and  155,000 respectively. 
Consideration for the trade and 
assets of the business was 
 909,000.
Since acquiring the business we 
have relocated it to new larger 
premises in Rochester. This 
acquisition not only provides 
additional scale but also 
provides significant operational 
benefits by enabling us to 
service South East clients from 
these premises. The addition of 
experienced staff and delivery 
vehicles will also allow us to offer 
a better service to our existing 
customer base.
Demand for our services has 
been strengthened by the 
continued development of the 
oil and gas industry around the 
world. Over the past six years 
Crestchic has successfully 
performed a number of projects 
in the Caspian region for large oil 
consortia. In September we 
acquired a controlling 51% 
shareholding in RDS (Technical) 
Ltd (RDS ), a Jersey registered 
company which conducts the 
majority of its activities through 
a branch office in Baku, 
Azerbaijan. RDS has been 
Crestchic's agent in the area 
since 2001. The principal 
business of RDS is to provide 
generators and associated 
OUTLOOk
The sales order book and 
enquiries at the beginning of 
2008 are at record levels and we 
are planning substantial further 
investment in our hire fleet. Both 
of our acquisitions in 2007 have 
made a positive contribution 
towards profits this year and are 
expected to make a good 
contribution to earnings over 
the full year in 2008.
We are continuing to trade in 
buoyant markets worldwide 
where the increased investment 
in energy infrastructures has 
created an ongoing demand for 
our products and services.
Early indications are that RDS will 
continue to trade strongly and 
that the option over the 
remaining 49% will be exercised 
on 31 March 2008.
Trading at our new operation in 
the Middle East has got off to a 
good start and we are hoping to 
complete the acquisition of new 
premises during the year to 
further capitalise on the 
opportunities in the region.
We are confident that we will 
continue to make good progress 
in growing the Group over the 
coming year.

equipment by way of hire, sale 
and service to the oil and gas 
industry in the Caspian region.
The total consideration for our 
initial 51% was  650,000. In the 
unaudited accounts to 31 March 
2006, RDS had a turnover of  1.1 
million, profit on ordinary 
activities before UK taxation of 
 279,000 and net assets 
(including cash balances of 
 567 ,000) were  1.3 million.
Northbridge has a call option to 
purchase, and the vendor of RDS 
has a put option to sell, the 
remaining 49% of RDS on 31 
March 2008. The price will be 
determined on a multiple of the 
audited profits before taxation 
of RDS for the year ending 31 
March 2008, subject to a 
maximum price to be paid for 
100% of RDS of  1.8 million. This 
level will be achieved if the 
profits before taxation of RDS are 
 328,000 or more in the year 
ending 31 March 2008. Net 
assets at 31 December of RDS 
were  1.8 million including  1.0 
million of cash.
Our acquisitions and other 
investments in 2007 have been 
made out of the Group's existing 
banking facilities. These were 
renegotiated during the year 
and comprise a mortgage 
against the freehold premises of 
 1.5 million, with a term of 15 
years and an interest rate of 
1.25% above base rate, and a 
multi-option working capital 
facility of  1.0 million.
STR ATEGy Northbridge's strategy is set out 
in the placing document in 
2006. This is to acquire and 
consolidate specialist industrial 
equipment businesses. The 
criteria that these potential 
targets will possess are:
 Potential for expansion into 
complete outsourcing 
providers.
 Supplying, or capable of 
supplying a non-cyclical 
customer base including 
utility companies, the public 
sector and the oil and gas 
sector.
 Incorporating a strong 
element of service work.
 Turnover between 
approximately  1 million to 
 10 million.
By consolidating a number of 
such companies Northbridge 
can add significant value 
through organic expansion into 
new geographical or industry 
markets and through 
complementary acquisitions, 
increase the Company's product 
offering to its customer base. In 
delivering such a strategy we will 
be able to capitalise on the 
market opportunity to become 
a significant industrial services 
business serving an international 
market. The Board actively 
continue to search for suitable 
acquisitions.
STAff We would like to take the 
opportunity to thank the 
employees of the Group for their 
contribution in delivering this 
excellent set of results. We 
would also like to welcome the 
new employees who have 
joined the Group through recent 
acquisitions and thank them for 
the smooth transition to new 
ownership.
