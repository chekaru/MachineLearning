 The year ended 30 September 2005
has been one of change. Change 
in terms of revenue performance
between the two halves of the year -
 9.4m second half versus  4.8m first
half. Change in terms of product - 
a dozen new product releases and
upgrades across the Group. Change
in terms of management - Julian
Morris passing on the role of Chief
Executive to Nick Bolton.
We believe OMG is a business with
an exciting present and enticing
future. The present is a Group of
companies in strong or dominant
global market positions, with
distributed geographical and sector
risk. The future is one of realisable
opportunities in both core and
diversified business based on a 
deep pool of technology.
Financial Summary
Group turnover, including
acquisitions, rose 30% to  14.2m
(2004:  10.9m). Turnover excluding
the acquisition of Peak Performance
Technologies, Inc.'s business (Peak )
grew 19% to  12.9m.
Gross profits improved from 56% 
of turnover to 60% due to higher
volume and lower manufacturing
costs of the new MX motion capture
system. However, the improvement in
gross margin was partially offset by
the sale of earlier product lines at
lower margins.
Operating profit before amortisation
of goodwill and exceptional items
increased by 193% to  923,000
(2004:  315,000) and after goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items,
increased by 107% to  593,000
(2004:  286,000).
The exceptional items amounting 
to  216,000 comprise one-off costs
relating to the cost of rationalising
distribution channels following the
acquisition of Peak and the cost of
changes within senior management.
Profit before tax improved by 51% to
 690,000 (2004:  457,000). Earnings
per share increased by 65% to 1.27p
(2004: 0.77p).
The Group's strong cash position
further improved during the year to
 4.4m (2004:  4.1m).
Business Review
Second Half Turnaround
Group full-year profit before tax 
of  690,000 contrasts dramatically
with the reported first half loss of
 549,000. Stand-alone second half
profit before tax was a healthy 
13% of equivalent revenues. The
turnaround was achieved by a major
improvement in revenues and tight
control and selective reduction 
of costs.
Sales management has been
completely reorganised with more
direct and regular reporting of UK
and US sales teams. Product 
lines, services, procedures and
infrastructure are being consolidated
across all operations within the
Group. Manufacturing costs are
being further reduced by higher
volume production of standard
products.

25514 PRE  30/1/06  9:57 am  Page 2 Global Revenue Growth
Revenue growth for the year was
strong across all markets, with the
exception of UK which, as previously
reported, enjoyed exceptional
revenues in the previous year.
For the first time in the Group's
history, North America delivered 
over half (58%) of global revenues.
Including eight months of sales 
from Peak, the Group's second 
US acquisition, revenues from 
North America increased by 62%.
Excluding Peak, revenues from 
North America rose 37%. In the
second half year, several large
individual orders - one for over $3m
for a very large installation of the
new MX40 motion capture system -
were won in the highly competitive
US entertainment market.
Far Eastern and Continental
European markets also grew well
with revenues up by 83% and 16%
respectively. In particular, Japanese
revenues were up 109%, with strong
growth across all market sectors.
Acquisition of Peak & other
Corporate Investment
The Group's core business was
significantly strengthened by the
acquisition of the business of 
Peak based in Denver, Colorado in
February 2005. Peak is a specialist 
in motion capture for sports science
and human and animal motion
research using video image recording.
Within 45 days of completion, the two
existing companies' product ranges
were combined and re-branded
under the name Vicon Peak. Within
60 days, the Peak Motus motion
capture software was re-engineered
to use Vicon's MX cameras. Within
90 days, the first Vicon orders were
taken through a former Peak sales
channel and global distribution
channels were rationalised, allowing
access to all markets.
Peak's product range for its well-
established sports and animal
science markets in North America 
is now considerably extended.
In Europe, the response of the
academic sports science market to
the merger of two well-respected
companies and the availability of a
combined optical and video motion
capture system has been particularly
strong. As a result, since joining
OMG, Peak's sales have increased
while its costs are reduced, giving
the business new focus as a
profitable operation.
During the year, the Group has 
taken a 12% stake in Munich-based
start-up Contemplas GmbH.
Contemplas produces software for
simple 2D and 3D motion capture
and analysis based on video (DV)
recording. Their aim is to bring the
technology into consumer-driven
markets such as running-shoe
selection and fitness assessment.
Marketing Led, Engineering Driven
Global sales channels for the
Group's core products, built around
motion capture and camera tracking,
are well established. Applications

from medical research and treatment
to engineering ergonomics; and 
from sports performance to the 
study of the neural control of the 
gait of millipedes.
During the year the Group has
increased its marketing resource,
bringing systematic analysis and
planning to the process of prioritising
and specifying the Group's product
development.
Industry Awards
In February 2005, Vicon Motion
Systems was awarded a Scientific 
& Technical Academy Award, a
Technical Oscar , by the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences for
contributions made through optical
motion capture to the film industry.
The Company's other leading
product for the entertainment
industry, 2d3's boujou automatic
camera tracker, was used in 4 out
the 7 films nominated for the Oscar
for Best Visual Effects, including the
winning film Lord of the Rings.
New Product Introductions
The Vicon Peak MX product 
range has been enhanced by the
introduction of MX Bridge and
Reference Video. MX Bridge allows
many older models of Vicon camera
to be used alongside the new MX
cameras. Customers wishing to
upgrade their systems can now do 
so gradually, without having to
discard existing cameras.
As well as the integration of MX
cameras into the Peak Motus
system, Vicon software has 
also been enhanced to allow
simultaneous video capture from a
range of DV and digital machine
vision cameras with a range of
resolutions and frame rates.
Vicon Peak motion capture systems
are frequently used in applications
where accurate 3-dimensional
tracking of targets, ranging from
surgical and medical devices to
performing actors and animals, 
is required in real time . During 
the year, the development of a
combination of new tracking
algorithms and software 
engineering for parallel processing
on multi-processor computers has
dramatically increased real-time
performance. The possibility of a
director viewing a live multi-character
animation as it is performed removes
one of the remaining separators
between motion capture and
traditional film making.
2d3's original automatic camera
tracker, boujou, used mainly 
in the movie industry has been
considerably enhanced and
upgraded with the release during 
the year of versions 3.0 and 3.1.
A simpler version of boujou, aimed 
at video and educational markets, 
is now sold under the name bullet.

manager, to evaluate opportunities
for radical diversification of the
Group's business. The main 
criteria were:
Market potential well above 
the combined markets of the 
Group's current products
Expectation of taking and holding
market leadership and dominance
Gain leverage from existing 
in-house or accessible new
technologies
From several dozen potential
business areas, a short list of
opportunities has emerged, 
winning the unanimous support 
of the Board.
One opportunity in a defence
application of 2d3's structure-from-
motion  IP has moved forward with
the recently-announced development
agreement with QinetiQ. Another,
based on IP from both Vicon and
2d3, concerns management and
maintenance of key national
infrastructure. For reasons of
commercial sensitivity it is not
possible to give more details of 
these developments at present.
Dividend Policy
As in previous years, the Directors
are not declaring a dividend,
although the dividend policy will 
be kept under review.
Comment & Outlook
Despite the marked contrast 
between the first and second 
halves, the Group's overall financial
performance in 2004/5 was very
satisfactory, with excellent revenue
growth, market diversification, good
control of costs and cash, and
increasingly healthy profits.
The Group's plan is to continue 
this pattern of profitable growth in
two ways. Firstly, through business
execution in our core markets, where
market activity appears well able to
support this plan. Secondly, through
a structured business diversification
programme. Although at a very early
stage, the new opportunities for
diversification look exciting.
Currently the Company has adequate
internal resources to progress these
diversifications and has already
committed an initial investment of
 0.2m so far this year. Details of
progress with diversifications will be
made available in due course.
Trading in the current year is 
making a strong start and we will
review progress at the Annual
General Meeting.
