 The year to 31 December 2012 has been
one of progress and development for
Oxford Advanced Surfaces (OAS). Our new
CEO joined in October bringing a strong
focus on delivering our technologies to the
market.
There are significant markets, applications
and commercial potential open to OAS.
Our proprietary technology offering, which
has strong IP and know-how, along with a
focussed team and growing market
provides the key elements required to allow
us to achieve our commercial and strategic
goals.
Market Evolution & Opportunity
OAS addresses growing and evolving
markets across multiple industries for both
our Onto
TM
and VISARC
TM
technologies.
Each market segment we address is driven
through innovation and the need for
increased functionality and value-add as
new products and capabilities are
developed by customers.
The Onto
TM
technology and product
offering is primarily targeted at the
adhesion promotion industry for
applications with coatings and films and a
wide range of polymer substrates. Market
leaders in adhesive technology are
focussed on innovative technology trends
and the adoption of new materials to
provide novel adhesive solutions. Market
drivers, such as the need for lighter and
more efficient transport solutions,
sustainable and renewable technologies
and increased global and mobile
communications, all contribute to an
increased opportunity for adhesion
promotion. The use of organic materials
continues to expand throughout industry in
applications such as printing, flexible
displays, solar power generation and
printed electronics.
Increased functionality and the need for
size, weight and cost reduction is
expanding the scope and use of polymer
based products leading to larger
addressable markets for Onto
TM
. In addition
to this, broader surface modification
applications, such as oil and water repellent
coatings, all contribute to an expanding
marketplace for our products.
Our VISARC
TM
technology primarily targets
the global electronic display market in
which the adoption of anti-reflection
coatings for reduced glare, increased
viewing angle and improved visual
performance is growing across all forms of
display. Large area televisions, PC display
monitors, tablets and smartphones are all
being introduced to the consumer and
industrial display markets with anti-
reflection coatings being used as a key
differentiator.
The broader penetration of flat screen
televisions, along with the overall increase
in display area for televisions, PCs, tablets
and smartphones, will generate an
estimated anti-reflection coating market of
c. US$1 billion by 2016. This potential
market is increased significantly by
industrial applications as user interfaces
become interactive through optical display
technology in transport, manufacturing,
medical and test and measurement fields.
Other applications, in solar panel efficiency
and opthalmics, provide us with an
evolving multi-billion dollar market for our
VISARC
TM
technology.
Business Development & Strategy
2012 focussed on the continued
development and execution of our
technology along with product
development plans for both the Onto
TM
and
VISARC
TM
technologies.
Onto
TM
Technology
Our Onto
TM
strategy and technology
development has concentrated on
adhesion promotion for coatings. Our third
generation of the Onto
TM
species - Onto
TM
XL, with a highly functionalised head - has
been evaluated with a broad range of
coatings (such as inks and polyvinyl
polymers) and substrates (such as PET, PE,
PTFE and PC).
Improved performance has been
demonstrated against industry standard
tests with data packages collected and
marketed across multiple industries. This
demonstrates significant progress from the
performance and applicability
demonstrated in 2011 on metal adhesion
for use in the electronics industry.
A focussed marketing campaign
commenced in the second half of 2012 on
adhesion promotion for polymers. This has
continued into 2013 and we expect a
number of specific and custom projects will
be generated with a view to achieving
commercial revenues in late 2013. Short
term technical milestones need to be met
to allow this to happen, along with further
development of key customer
engagements.
Field trials with Onto
TM
XL used as an
adhesion promoter, which commenced in
2011, were extended in 2012 with a tier one
thin film customer completing lifetime
testing for an industrial roll-to-roll volume
application. Manufacturing trials are
expected through 2013 with a view to
providing volume demand in 2014.
The XL based solvent-resistant oil and
water repellent treatments, where we
greatly lower the surface energy of various
substrates and which solves many
industrial and manufacturing needs,
remains a key technology and product
offering as a follow on to our adhesion
promotion push and strategy execution.
During 2012 volume capable processing,
formulation and supply has been
demonstrated and engagement with
volume capable outsource partners is in
progress.
The 2013 priority for the Onto
TM
technology
is the commercialisation of our newly
demonstrated performance capability with
improved products.
Review of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
2      Annual Report 2012
Oxford Advanced Surfaces Group plc VISARC
TM
Technology
Our activity during 2012 on the VISARC
TM
anti-reflective technology has been
concerned with developing variants of
mesoporous silica nanoparticles,
increasing our formulation knowledge,
demonstrating high performance coatings
and validating our volume manufacturing
capability and partners.
Firstly, variants of our nanoparticles have
been synthesised with different
functionalities to match substrate and
formulation/binder systems. Particles
tailored to glass and polymer substrates
have been made and supplied to
customers for evaluation in their
formulations and coatings for use in
applications such as televisions, PCs,
tablets and smartphones.
The ability to functionalise particles in
different ways to match individual customer
formulation requirements demonstrates
further progress in our objectives. It opens
up greater flexibility when working with the
global customer base and this activity will
continue to expand in 2013.
Secondly, we have focussed on increasing
our formulation knowledge within
development agreements and on our own
internal projects. It has become clear that
specific formulation knowledge around our
various nanoparticles and how they
interface with the customer binder systems
and the multiple substrates used in the
industry is critical in achieving durable, low
reflection coatings. We have strengthened
our internal knowledge with external
consultants and the recently expanded
Technical Advisory Board is helping to
drive our internal capabilities.
The combination of optimum optical
performance with mechanical robustness
and durability has been, and remains, a
major objective as we enter 2013.
Finally, we have confirmed our volume
manufacturing capability and partners and
we are now looking at various particle
processing options with a view to selecting
the most efficient route forward from both
a capital efficiency and process
perspective.
As announced in early 2012, we are
currently engaged in a non-exclusive joint
development agreement with a major
global coating and substrate company for
electronic displays. Whilst this program has
seen some delays in achieving key
milestones, mostly around the matching of
particles to formulation, we continue to
drive critical developments in order to
progress this agreement.
Board and Organisation
The OAS Board of Directors has been
stable throughout 2012 with no changes
other than the appointment of the new CEO
in October 2012.
This appointment has added significantly to
the breadth and depth of the Board in
terms of technology development and new
product introduction into consumer driven
industrial markets. Active Board
involvement in steering the company
remains a priority. In early 2013 we
enhanced our Technology Advisory Board
to accelerate our technology development.
At the end of 2012 employee numbers,
excluding non-executive Directors, stood at
20, of which 16 were focussed on research
and development. We expect employee
numbers to remain fairly constant until
commercial deals are completed, at which
point we will require additional scale-up
and operational/commercial resources.
Our process and systems were re-audited
by British Standards and we successfully
retained our ISO 9001: 2008 accreditation.
Outlook
The transition from research and
development to full commercial availability
of our technology and product offerings
remains our top priority and we look to
achieve this in the current year.
Strong market pull and emerging
applications will provide significant
opportunities for the Company when
combined with effective technology
execution.
