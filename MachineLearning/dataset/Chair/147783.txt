The Parkmead Group plc 
Annual Report 2013
Operations and Portfolio Growth 
The Group has made considerable progress towards building an independent oil and gas company  
of significant scale, by maximising opportunities and adding value to Parkmead's growing portfolio. 
In May 2013, the Group announced its recommended offer for Lochard, which was completed 
post financial year end in July 2013. As a result, Parkmead now holds a 10% working interest in the 
producing Athena oil field in the UK North Sea. This has increased Parkmead's production, revenue 
and cash flow substantially, and provides an excellent complement to our gas production in the 
Netherlands.  We are working alongside the operator of Athena to increase oil recovery from the 
field, thus maximising shareholder value from the Lochard acquisition.
In line with our strategy, Parkmead has shown a strong appetite for value-accretive 
transactions, at both asset and corporate level, as we look to build oil and gas 
projects  across the entire spectrum from exploration through to appraisal, 
development and production. Parkmead is pleased to have completed the 
DEO Petroleum plc (DEO ) acquisition as well as the purchase of a portfolio 
of producing Netherlands assets, both in August 2012.  These acquisitions have 
provided the Group with low-cost onshore gas production as well as a sizeable 
new oil reserves position in the UK. 
Acquisitions to date have focused on opportunities in Parkmead's preferred 
geographical area of Europe. The high level of activity demonstrates the drive 
and ambition of our Company, and its team, and creates a strong foundation 
from which to become a key E&P player in the North Sea and beyond. 
Parkmead is equally focused on building the business through organic growth, 
with licence applications, seismic and drilling. In October 2012, the Group was 
awarded six new licences in the UKCS 27th Licensing Round, covering 25 
blocks across the Central North Sea, West of Shetlands and West of Scotland, 
all with Parkmead as operator.

The Parkmead Group plc 
Annual Report 2013
2013 has been an excellent year for Parkmead. Following strong growth in the Group's oil and gas portfolio during 
2012, in May 2013 the Company announced its acquisition of Lochard Energy Group PLC (Lochard ), Parkmead's 
largest deal to date. The Lochard acquisition provides Parkmead with a significant increase in production, revenue and 
cash flow, which acts as a superb platform for the Company's next phase of growth. 
Parkmead was successful in winning interests in, and operatorship of, a total of 25 offshore blocks across the UK in 
the 27th Licensing Round in October 2012. The award of these new licences was finalised in January 2013. We have 
already begun various work programmes across the blocks, with seismic and detailed mapping work underway.  This 
substantial increase in the Group's asset base has firmly established Parkmead as an offshore operator in the UK.   The Parkmead Group plc

This was an outstanding result for our Company, ranking Parkmead 
in the top tier of awardees in the Licensing Round. Parkmead's 
operatorship of all of the new licences awarded to the Group 
confirms the industrial credibility and reputation of the Parkmead 
geotechnical team. The licence awards were finalised in January 2013 
and we have already initiated various work programmes across a 
number of the blocks. The Group has also applied for certain licences 
in the 27th Round within the UK Southern Gas Basin. These are yet 
to be awarded by the UK government due to their location close 
to, or in, certain Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special 
Protection Areas (SPAs). 
In August 2012, the Group was delighted to announce very positive  
drilling results from the Platypus appraisal well in the UK Southern 
North Sea. A horizontal well was successfully completed and flow 
tested at 27 million cubic feet of gas per day. Parkmead is working 
closely with its partners on the Platypus gas field to fast-track the 
development programme, with a draft Field Development Plan 
(FDP) expected to be submitted in due course.  As we move 
into 2014, the Group has an active work programme across its 
portfolio of assets, with the aim of adding further shareholder value 
to each project. Our oil and gas team will continue to utilise its 
detailed technical knowledge of certain proven and frontier areas to 
identify and acquire assets, including participation in further UK and 
international licensing rounds.
The three aforementioned acquisitions, alongside Parkmead's 27th 
Licensing Round awards, have provided the Group with a strong and 
balanced portfolio across the asset life cycle. 
Results 
The Group's revenue has increased significantly in 2013 to 
 4.1m (2012:  2.9m). This increase in revenue was driven by gas 
production from Parkmead's Netherlands portfolio, demonstrating 
the value of these assets at this early stage in the Company's 
growth. Administrative expenses were  7.7m (2012:  5.5m). The 
Group's operating loss for the year was  5.1m (2012:  4.7m). The 
loss after tax was  5.6m (2012:  4.9m). T otal comprehensive loss 
for the year was  6.9m (2012:  5.1m).
Parkmead's total assets have more than doubled to  53.4m  
(2012:  22.9m). This was as a result of the acquisition of DEO 
Petroleum plc and a portfolio of Netherlands assets from Dyas B.V. 
Available-for-sale financial assets were  4.4m (2012:  6.5m). Cash and 
cash equivalents increased considerably to  13.3m (2012:  7.7m). 
The total current liabilities were  11.1m (2012:  4.2m).
The Group's net asset value more than trebled to  37.3m  
(2012:  12.3m). In August 2012, Parkmead completed the 
acquisition of fellow independent oil and gas company, DEO 
Petroleum plc. This acquisition was completed by way of a court 
sanctioned Scheme of Arrangement and offered DEO shareholders 
two Parkmead shares for every DEO share held. Following this deal 
86,219,860 ordinary shares were admitted for trading.
In January 2013, the Group raised approximately  15.925 million 
(gross) through a successful, oversubscribed placing of 130m new 
ordinary shares at 12.25 pence per share, providing Parkmead with 
considerable financial firepower for further growth. In addition,  
27.8m new ordinary shares were issued to T P Cross (and entities  
affiliated to him) at the placing price, pursuant to the conversion  
of  3.4 million of loans drawn down by the Company from  
T P Cross (and entities affiliated to him). Some 1,744,908 new 
ordinary shares were issued on the exercise of options, bringing 
the Group's total ordinary shares in issue to 921,139,016 (2012: 
675,419,147). 
Subsequent to its 30 June year-end, the Group completed 
the acquisition of Lochard. Like DEO, this acquisition was also 
completed by way of a court sanctioned Scheme of Arrangement 
and offered Lochard shareholders 0.385 Parkmead shares for every 
Lochard share held. Following this acquisition 115,063,262 ordinary 
shares were admitted for trading and the Group's total ordinary 
shares in issue increased to 1,036,202,278.
As at 30 June 2013 Parkmead had drawn  2.0m of its shareholder 
loan facility following the debt for equity conversion. Due to 
Parkmead's ongoing growth and investment programme, the Board 
is not recommending the payment of a dividend in 2013 (2012: nil).
Investments
The Group's principal investment is shares held in Faroe Petroleum 
plc (Faroe ) (LSE AIM: FPM.L). As at 30 June 2013, the value of this 
investment was  4.4m (30 June 2012:  6.5m). The investment is 
held as available-for-sale and the decrease in its value due to share 
price movement has been reflected in equity. 
Faroe's share price fell from 148p to 113p over the 12 months to 
30 June 2013. Faroe reported a significant boost to production and 
revenue, together with a number of new licence awards across the 
UK and Norway.  However, after two unsuccessful drilling results in 
quick succession, targeting the North Uist prospect in the UK West 
of Shetlands and the Darwin prospect in Norway, the share price 
decreased to 113p at 30 June 2013. We remain of the view that 
Faroe has long-term upside with an ongoing drilling programme and 
a broad portfolio of exploration licences. 
Outlook
The Directors of Parkmead are delighted with the major progress 
the Group has made this year in building an exciting independent 
oil and gas company of increasing scale. With a balanced asset 
base and the completion of the acquisition of Lochard in July 2013, 
we believe Parkmead has built considerable momentum over the 
last twelve months. In addition, we are pleased by our substantial 
award in the UKCS 27th Licensing Round, with Parkmead elected 
as operator of all the 25 blocks awarded to the Company.  We also 
look forward to the results of the Pharos exploration well which is 
currently in progress.
As we advance towards 2014 and beyond, our team maintains its 
appetite for acquisitions and will seek to add shareholder value 
through a dynamic work programme.  The Group has built a  
strong platform from which to become a key E&P player in the 
North Sea, and we look forward to updating shareholders as we 
make further progress.
