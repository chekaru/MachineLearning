 02 Pipex Communications plc Annual report and accounts 2006
 WE HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY IMPRESSED WITH THE PROFESSIONALISM 
OF THE PIPEX TEAM AND THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARDS ATTENTION-TO-DETAIL 
AND DEADLINES. THEY HAVE DELIVERED AGAINST VERY AGGRESSIVE 
PROJECT TIMELINES AND SUCCESSFULLY TAKEN THIS ADVENTUROUS 
LARGE-SCALE PROJECT IN THEIR STRIDE. 
 MARTIN GILL, HEAD OF NEW MEDIA, COMIC RELIEF
OVERVIEW
I am pleased to report that 2006 was another strong year for Pipex 
with transformational acquisitions in our broadband business and 
continuing strong organic growth in hosting. Revenues, including 
acquisitions, increased by 121% to  294 million (2005:  133 million) 
and EBITDA (pre share option costs) increased by 55% to  23.2 million 
(2005:  15.0 million). Free cash flow before freehold purchases of 
 9.9 million was also strong at  17.6 million compared to  7.9 million 
in 2005, despite significant capital expenditure in the reported year on 
our LLU programme.
I have previously reported to you on our focus of providing additional 
services to customers in order to support prices and margins and to 
reduce churn. In 2006, we made a step-change to our capabilities in 
this area with the acquisition, in March, of Homecall. This added a sizable 
voice and line rental business to our Broadband division and gave us a 
strong platform from which to launch the sale of additional services into 
our customer base. Later in the year we added further scale to our Broadband 
and Voice division with the purchase of the Bulldog customer base, 
in September, and with the acquisition of Toucan in October. At the end 
of 2006, Pipex had over one million customers in this division, over 50% 
of whom take multiple services.
Following such a period of acquisitive growth, Pipex will be progressively 
integrating and consolidating its broadband and voice businesses over 
the remainder of this year and throughout 2008. We believe that the 
efficiency savings available to us from running this division as a unified 
business will contribute significantly to our bottom line in future periods.
We continue to enjoy strong organic growth in our hosting and domain 
names division, driven by ever increasing levels of Internet based activity. 
We are building a state-of-the-art data centre in Cologne to support the 
rapid expansion of our German business, with the first customers 
commissioned in the new site in March 2007.
Also in 2006, we embarked on the commercial exploitation of our 
wireless spectrum licence, in our joint venture with Intel, successfully 
trialling WiMAX based services in Stratford-upon-Avon.
CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
The biggest opportunity... is from the 
integration of the recent acquisitions of 
Homecall, Toucan and the customers of 
Bulldog to form a single unified business, 
eliminating the functional replication 
existing in the current structure. This process 
will be completed by the end of 2008 and 
will deliver a significant improvement in 
EBITDA margin for the division.

BROADBAND AND VOICE SERVICES
The impact of the acquisitions in this area has lifted customer numbers 
from 283,000 at the end of 2005 to in excess of one million by the end of 
2006. Most importantly, the penetration of multiple service sales into our 
customers has grown from an insignificant number at the end of 2005 to 
a year later where each of our customers takes, on average, 1.74 services 
from us. This has helped us to lift average revenue per customer to  24.70 
per month from  23.00 per month last year, in the face of market pricing 
pressures, particularly in broadband.
For the customer experience, our focus is to provide excellent connection 
quality backed up by high quality customer service. We have straightforward 
pricing with consistent, unified prices for all our services nationwide. 
We operate a hybrid cost model to help maintain margins. This allows 
us to optimise service delivery costs to customers by choosing from a 
number of alternate wholesale providers and, of course, from our own 
local loop unbundling programme. At the end of 2006 we had unbundled 
59 exchanges. A further 41 will be unbundled by April 2007, and the 
remaining 75 are in the pipeline, and due for completion, in the fourth 
quarter of 2007. Pipex also benefits from a sizable base of business customers 
which ensures our broadband network is loaded and generating revenues 
in the daytime when residential traffic is low.
The biggest opportunity in this division is from the integration of the 
recent acquisitions of Homecall, Toucan and the customers of Bulldog 
to form a single unified business, eliminating the functional replication 
existing in the current structure. This process will be completed by the 
end of 2008 and will deliver a significant improvement in EBITDA margin 
for the division.
HOSTING SERVICES 
Once again, the division enjoyed good organic growth in the year. In the 
UK, we are the second largest hosting provider with 413,000 active sites. 
Domain Names have also performed strongly with UK growth of 33% to 
1.38 million. In Germany, the number of Hosting Services grew by 23% 
and domain names by 29% to 370,000. The division continues to benefit 
from very attractive margins.
Pipex provides a comprehensive suite of hosting services from shared 
and virtual private services right up to complex managed hosting solutions. 
On the back of strong organic growth in Germany in 2006, we invested 
in a new purpose-built data centre in Cologne. This will come on-stream 
in three phases, as driven by demand, and will provide sufficient capacity 
to meet predicted server requirements for the foreseeable future. 
The first customers went live in the facility in March 2007.
BUSINESS SERVICES
This division provides medium sized and larger businesses with virtual 
private networks, dedicated access, voice, security and bundled hosting 
solutions. During the year, we enhanced the management within the 
division to take advantage of the underlying growth in this sector. 
This has met with some early successes with significant customer 
wins including the British Library, Honda and Comic Relief.
 FOR THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, OUR FOCUS IS TO PROVIDE EXCELLENT CONNECTION 
QUALITY BACKED UP BY HIGH QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE HAVE STRAIGHTFORWARD 
PRICING WITH CONSISTENT, UNIFIED PRICES FOR ALL OUR SERVICES NATIONWIDE.

WIRELESS
At the end of March 2006 we announced a joint venture with Intel to 
form Pipex Wireless. The aim of the joint venture is to exploit its wireless 
spectrum licence in the 3.6 - 4.2 GHz band by providing WiMAX based 
services through a UK city roll-out. Pipex Wireless owns a perpetual, 
nationwide licence in the UK. Technical trials have been conducted in 
Stratford-upon-Avon from which we believe we will be able to deliver 
data speeds of up to 8 Mbs, synchronously. WiMAX has non-line of sight 
scalable coverage of up to 5km, similar to cellular networks, which compares 
to around only 50m for WiFi hotspots. The plan is to roll-out to 50 UK 
towns and cities by 2009, starting in Manchester later this year.
Pipex Wireless continues to seek out valuable partners in the roll-out of 
its services, and to this end announced in April 2007 an agreement with 
Nokia Siemens Networks to co-operate on WiMAX infrastructure and 
service development to expand the availability of commercial WiMAX 
services in the UK.
OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
Turnover in the year increased by 121% to  294 million, with an increase 
of 14% in continuing operations, to  152 million, and  142 million contributed 
by the 2006 acquisitions of Homecall, Toucan and the customers of Bulldog. 
Gross profit increased by 84% to  112 million. Total gross margin in the 
year decreased from 46.0% to 38.2%, the decline arising principally from 
the high volume of line rental revenues in the mix of services in the 2006 
acquisitions. This is demonstrated in the gross margin contributed by the 
acquired businesses of 31.6%. EBITDA (before share option costs) rose in 
the year by 55% to  23.2 million. Free cash flow generated, before freehold 
purchases, was  17.6 million, up from  7.9 million last year despite substantial 
investments in LLU of  5.8 million. In the year we acquired the freeholds 
of our Manchester office, housing 850 staff, and the site for the new data 
centre in Germany.
CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT CONTINUED
 WE ANTICIPATED INTENSE DEMAND FOR VIEWING THE NEWLY REUNITED 
LEONARDO DA VINCI'S NOTEBOOKS ONCE THEY WERE LIVE ON THE BRITISH 
LIBRARY WEBSITE. SUCH ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY REQUIRES A HIGHLY 
AVAILABLE AND RESILIENT NETWORK WHICH PIPEX HAS DELIVERED WITH 
GREAT SUCCESS.

FUNDING
We undertook a small placing in January 2006 raising  13.6 million, net 
of expenses, at 13p per share to raise funds for future growth opportunities.
In March and April of 2006 we raised  91.5 million ( 88.3 million net 
of expenses) through the private placement of 3.875% Guaranteed 
Convertible Bonds 2011. The bonds had a price of 15.1p and are convertible 
at 19p into ordinary shares and are listed on the Professional Securities 
Market of the London Stock Exchange. The proceeds of the bonds were 
used to repay a  40.0 million bridging loan, obtained to fund the purchase 
of Homecall and to repay all of Pipex's existing bank debt, amounting 
to  35.2 million. 
In October 2006, the company entered into a new senior debt facility 
of  35.0 million to fund the purchase consideration for the Bulldog and 
Toucan acquisitions.
OUTLOOK
In the first quarter of 2007, we have continued to see an increase in 
the average number of services bought by our Broadband and Voice 
customers and this should continue to protect margins whilst inhibiting 
churn. The opportunity to reduce costs in this division by integrating our 
acquired operations will, we believe, ensure improving EBITDA margins 
and cash flow over this year and next.
We look forward in 2007 to launching the first commercial WiMAX 
services in the UK. These services are currently being trialled in 
Milton Keynes and Warwick as the forerunner to our first full-scale 
city roll-out in Manchester in the fourth quarter.
