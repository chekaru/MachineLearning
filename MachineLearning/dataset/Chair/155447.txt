Chairman's and Chief Executive's Statement
Introduction
Premier Direct Group Plc (PDG ), the national shopping-at-work
company , announces its results for the year ended 31 July 2007.
These are the first financial statements prepared by the Group in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the EU (IFRSs). Further comment on this is included in
the Financial Review section of this statement.
The Directors are pleased to confirm that the Group has continued
to trade profitably during the seasonally slower second half of the
year. On total revenue of  21.2 million (2006:  25.5 million), the
Group achieved an operating profit of  1.5 million (2006:  1.9
million) before one-off costs. After charging one-off costs of
 0.4 million (2006:  4.3 million) and interest of  0.6 million (2006:
 0.6 million), the pre-tax profit of  0.5 million (2006: loss of  3.0
million) was in line with the Board's expectations.
As anticipated at the time of our trading statement in August, given
the encouraging performance of the Group, the Directors intend to
propose a dividend of 1p per share at the AGM on 11 December
2007 which, if approved, will be paid on 24 December 2007 to
shareholders on the register as at 30 November 2007.
Operating review
The Board remains committed to its strategy of sustainable growth in
the distributor network whilst offering the best earning opportunity
in the sector. To this end, the Board has continued to implement
measures with a view to steadily improving the performance of the
business. A wide ranging review of the business in 2006 led to new
recruitment structures, redefinition of the sales territories and
restructuring of internal functions. This led to significant reduction
in stock levels during the seasonally quieter second half and at the
same time enhanced the product range to the benefit of both our
distributor network and our end customers.
Sales and marketing
As we reported last year, one of the consequences of a series of
acquisitions was significant overlap in the territories served by the
distributor force, which adversely affected the strength of our
product mix. This impacted on the sales force's earnings,
subsequently leading to a net loss of distributors. A single territory
map for our distributor network was adopted in August 2006 and
has eliminated overlap, greatly improved stock utilisation and aided
our ability to undertake our recruitment activities in a more
structured and effective manner.
During the current year, we implemented changes to our field
management structure, appointing a team of 20 Business
Coordinators. They have assumed responsibility for the recruitment
and training of distributors, typically across five areas, while
continuing to generate income from their personal sales effort. These
Business Coordinators remain part of our self-employed sales
network although they also receive a retainer for their additional
services and a performance related payment based on sales growth.
The new structure is already showing positive results with
stabilisation of the distributor network and recruitment progressing
on target as we approach the most intense sales period in the run-up
to Christmas.
This year has been a year of recovery in terms of our distributor
network and by the end of the year, we had achieved a steady
platform on which to grow distributor numbers at a sustainable rate.

We ended the financial year with 540 distributors, compared with
490 at the end of the last financial year, and this number is expected
to continue to grow during the key Christmas period.
Product sourcing
Our dedicated buying team has continued to source innovative new
product lines to complement our book ranges. We have expanded
our relationship with a key partner in the Far East, achieving a
fresher range of products and a higher degree of reliability regarding
shipment dates. This improvement in range has resulted in an 11%
increase in sales per site visited across the year. Factory gate prices in
China have begun to increase although this has been partially offset
by the weaker US Dollar. We are investigating India as a possible
new source for competitively priced product.
Reduction in overheads
A number of cost reduction measures have been implemented across
the business. We have been able to eliminate the night shift picking
operation in our warehouse without impacting on operational
efficiencies, and various administration and finance roles have been
reduced as a result of the new IT systems. These savings will amount
to almost  0.5 million on an annualised basis. The full impact of
these cost savings is expected to benefit the current year.
The new IT system has been implemented and is gradually settling
down. The benefits from the system are expected to become visible
in the current year.
Oriflame is trading satisfactorily and continues to generate profit and
cash for the Group. The traditional Oriflame business has seen a
steady improvement in turnover and profit since its acquisition in
April 2006. Oriflame at Work, our extension of the traditional
business into the shopping-at-work format, has shown some early
positive results and will be a particular focus in the next half year.
Financial review
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted
by the EU (IFRS )
The Group has historically prepared its consolidated and parent
company financial statements under UK Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). The AIM rules require the adoption
of IFRS as adopted by the EU (Adopted IFRS) for accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2007. During the second half of the
financial year, PDG implemented a new management information
and financial reporting system based on IFRS. The Board therefore
considered it appropriate to report results for the year ended 31 July
2007 under IFRS.
The accounting policies under Adopted IFRS are set out in the notes
to this announcement. As part of the transition to Adopted IFRS the
Directors have taken the opportunity to reassess all of the Group's
accounting policies and bases. They have concluded that it is more
appropriate to recognise revenue during the period and in future
periods only on sale by the distributor to the third party end
customer. Accordingly revenue has been recognised on this basis in
each of the opening balance sheet and periods presented.
A summary of the Group results is included below. The prior year
numbers have been restated under IFRS (note 31).
2007 2006
 m  m
Revenue 21.2 25.5
Gross profit 7.8 6.5
Profit/(loss) before tax 0.5 (3.0)
Details of the IFRS accounting policies are set out in note 1.
The adoption of Adopted IFRS does not change the Group's business
model, strategy , risk management processes or cash flows.

Financial results
Revenue for the year was  21.2 million compared with  25.5 million
for the year ended on 31 July 2006. Revenue at the
shopping-at-work business amounted to  19.1 million in 2007
compared with  25.0 million in 2006. In common with other
retailers, PDG has found the current trading environment to be
challenging, especially during the unusually warm Easter period and
recently due to the flooding experienced in many parts of the UK.
This has contributed to the reduction in turnover. In addition, this
year we have focused on stabilising the distributor network and
ensuring we have a steady platform on which to base sustainable
growth in distributor numbers.
Group gross profit rose from  6.5 million in 2006 to  7.8 million in
2007, assisted by the full year contribution from Oriflame.
Administrative expenses, excluding one-off costs, have fallen by  0.5
million to  6.3 million. This is due to management's continued focus
on the identification and implementation of cost efficiencies, in
particular staff costs which have fallen by  0.5 million.
The Group's operating profit was  1.1 million (2006: loss of  2.4
million). The net interest charge of  0.6 million was in line with
last year.
The profit before taxation was  0.5 million (2006: loss of  3.0
million). Basic earnings per share amounted to 2.9 pence, compared
with a loss of 12.0 pence in 2006.
Net debt (being bank loans plus hire purchase liabilities less cash at
the bank) has fallen to  6.1 million (2006:  6.6 million).
In August 2007, the Group agreed new banking facilities of  7
million with RBS, providing adequate resources to finance the
gradual growth of our businesses. The RBS fee for the facility was
satisfied by the grant of warrants over 600,000 ordinary shares in
PDG at a price of 45p per share. The warrants are valid until
31 July 2016.
People
On 31 July 2007, Graeme Allison, Finance Director, handed over to
Christine Stobbs ACA. Christine Stobbs joined PDG in April 2007
from KPMG. Graeme's strategic advice was very important during a
difficult time for the Group and his hard work during this time is
greatly appreciated. At the same time Paul Southworth retired as
Non-Executive Director on the Board. We were particularly grateful
to Paul for his counsel in relation to the acquisition of the UK
Oriflame business. The Board thanks both Graeme and Paul for their
contributions and wish them well for the future.
Indeed, the Board is grateful to all the staff of PDG and Oriflame for
their steadfast support during a year of recovery .
Outlook
Although it is relatively early in the Christmas sales season, the
Board is confident that our product offering is as strong as it has
been for some time and our distributors are well motivated. Further,
the anticipated sustainable growth in distributor numbers is
expected to continue in the busy Christmas period. Therefore we
expect improved trading in the first half over 2006. Indeed, trading
since 1 August 2007 in both businesses has been in line with the
Board's expectations.
