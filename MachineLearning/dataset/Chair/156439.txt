Chairman's 
Statement 
Summary
Following the November 2009 transformation of the Group, President's twin focus in 2010 was to 
prove up the potential value in the existing legacy assets in Louisiana, USA, and South Australia 
through drilling, and to add new assets through acquisition.
In January, the Group completed the acquisition of a 25% working interest in the East White Lake 
field in Louisiana and in August further deep drilling rights were acquired at President's existing 
East Lake Verret field.
The 2010 drilling and development plan for the legacy assets included two high-impact wells in 
Louisiana and South Australia respectively, and further low-cost drilling and work-overs at existing 
producing fields, with an emphasis on increasing oil production.
The schedule for drilling the deep Kafoury 3 well in Louisiana was contingent on the acquisition 
of the new leases and drilling commenced in November. A shortage of suitable drilling rigs in 
Australia impacted the timetable for drilling the Northumberland 2 well, but a contract was signed 
in August and the well spudded in March 2011.
In addition to the completed acquisitions in Louisiana, President evaluated a number of additional 
deals during the year but none met the Company's value criteria. Further acquisitions are 
anticipated and with increased spending commitments planned on drilling and development, the 
Company successfully raised US$50 million through a placing of shares in October. The placing 
was over-subscribed and well supported by Levine Capital Management, President's largest 
shareholder, and major UK institutions, both existing shareholders and new investors.

2010 sales revenues, net of royalties, over-rides and other interests, increased by 11% to 
US$3.4 million. This was despite average 2010 production of 185 boe/day being lower than 2009, 
when production included the Orion field, which was sold in June 2009. The strong revenue  {4}
Chairman's 
Statement  
performance was driven by the successful acquisition of East White Lake and a drilling and 
development plan focused on oil. Annual oil production increased by over 50% year-on-year and 
oil currently contributes 50% of production compared with 25% at the end of 2009. Better oil prices 
during the first half of the year helped boost revenue, whilst the oil production effect contributed 
to strong second half revenues of US$1.67 million, almost double 2009 levels.
The contribution to overheads from operations before depreciation increased by 6.5% to 
US$2.02 million while depreciation increased to reflect the re-appraisal of East Lake Verret 
reserves. Group overheads also rose as the Group utilised resources to assist in evaluating 
deal opportunities.
The October placing substantially increased the Group's year-end cash balances and net assets, 
to US$45.7 million and US$57.5 million respectively. This strong cash position will enable the 
Group to continue the work on its existing asset base and fund business development.
US Operations
Following President's acquisition of a 25% working interest in East White Lake, Peak Energy, the 
operator, drilled two successful development wells which increased President's share of 
production from 22 boe/day in January to a peak of 100 boe/day by the middle of the year. This 
increase, half of which was oil production, offset a decline in gas production at East Lake Verret. 
This decline was largely due to ever-increasing water production at the Kafoury 2 well, the largest 
producing well in the field. This decline is expected to continue in 2011 and as a result the 
Company has reduced its estimate of reserves for Kafoury 2 to reflect this.
The main upside identified at East Lake Verret was in deeper sands that were not current 
producers in the field but were significant producers in neighbouring fields. The deep rights to drill 
these prospects were acquired and the Kafoury 3 well was spudded in November. Kafoury 3 was 
drilled into a previously undrilled fault block and encountered significantly higher than expected 
pressures with complex geology and frequent high levels of background gas. Despite the 
challenging drilling conditions, President succeeded in completing and testing the well, but the test 
interval failed to produce commercial flows of gas. The drilling of Kafoury 3 took twice as long as 
anticipated with a corresponding increase in costs. At the year-end US$5.1 million of costs relating 
to Kafoury 3 were included in intangible assets.
There remains further potential in the Group's Louisiana fields, particularly at East White Lake 
where recent work and strong oil prices have encouraged a low cost drilling plan in 2011 targeting 
increased oil production which will benefit from a severance tax holiday and where any resulting 
profitability will be sheltered by President's US tax losses. Following the unsuccessful Kafoury 3 
exploration well, President has reviewed its strategy for Louisiana and will limit further investment 
to low-risk activity that will provide immediate additions to production. {5}
Australia Operations
The primary focus of President's Australian operations in 2010 was to spud the first exploration 
well, Northumberland 2, on the PEL 82 licence in South Australia. Whilst the geological, planning 
and regulatory aspects proceeded as planned, the shortage of suitable onshore drilling rigs and 
the cost of mobilisation to PEL 82 delayed the schedule. However, a contract for a drilling rig was 
signed in August, the well was spudded early in March 2011 and the results were announced in 
mid-April.
Whilst the well did not make a commercial discovery, the clear identification of hydrocarbons in 
the system, with a significantly thicker than expected Waarre reservoir sand, has given 
encouragement and impetus to move forward with further work on the licence. The results from 
Northumberland 2 have de-risked other prospects on PEL 82, particularly where we are able to 
identify structures with a complete and effective seal, and planning of the next steps in the 
exploration programme, potentially to include both seismic and drilling, is underway. The Board is 
of the view that, although non-commercial, Northumberland 2 may have enhanced the value 
proposition of PEL 82 both in terms of increased potential and reduction of risk.
An airborne gravity and magnetic survey was carried out on the Group's PEL 132 licence in South 
Australia and this has provided additional information to assist in the licence renewal and 
relinquishment process. PEL 132 is in a frontier area and it may be difficult to justify commercially 
significant additional expenditure in the near future.
