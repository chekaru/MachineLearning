 Psion 2002 / 04 chairman's statement
CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT:
David Potter, Chairman
In a difficult business environment, the Group has
re-established a stable base with a positive cash flow
during the year and a small operating profit before
exceptional items and goodwill amortisation.
Our associate company, Symbian, which represents
a major investment by the Group, has made
substantial progress in the developing smartphone
market.The company is seeing the growth of major
volumes in licensee shipments based on the Symbian
OS. Psion Teklogix has performed satisfactorily in
the prevailing business conditions. Psion Digital
operations ceased during the year. Progress has
been made in the development of a new business
providing middleware software connecting the
internet to the new generation of smartphones. Chairman's Statement

Results
Sales for the year were  137.9m (2001 -  181.1m). Sales from continuing operations were  128.6m (2001 -
 129.0m). Operating profits before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation were  3.5m (2001 - loss of
 5.5m). Goodwill amortisation of  16.0m (2001 -  23.7m) was charged for the year and the Group's share of losses
in joint ventures and associates, principally Symbian, amounted to  10.2m (2001 -  12.8m). In addition, exceptional
items of  8.1m, primarily for the closure of discontinued operations and write-downs in trade investments, were
charged giving rise to losses on ordinary activities before interest of  30.8m (2001 -  150.4m).After interest
received of  0.6m and a tax credit of  1.0m the retained loss was  29.2m (2001 -  150.1m). No dividend will be
paid for the year.
After negative cash flow in 2000 and 2001, the Group moved back into positive cash flow during the year, both
at an operating level and after all investment activities including the funding of our share of Symbian investment. Net
cash flow from operating activities amounted to  10.0m (2001 -  2.6m outflow).After providing for Psion's share
of Symbian's rights issue at the beginning of the year of  5.8m together with other investments, Psion's net cash flow
for the year was positive at  2.6m (2001 -  11.0m outflow).
Working capital performance has improved.The balance sheet of the Group is sound with shareholders' funds
of  169.7m (2001 -  193.6m) and net cash and short-term deposits of  30.1m (2001 -  28.4m) before loans
of  5.7m (2001 -  5.9m).
Psion Teklogix
Psion Teklogix supplies and services mobile enterprise solutions for larger corporations.The company addresses a
number of niche markets globally and is a leader in logistics applications for factories, warehouses, ports and hubs.
Following the worldwide downturn in 2001, business investment in the company's major markets of North America and
Europe continued to be very weak.This has been particularly true for corporate investment in information technology.
The performance of Psion Teklogix was good in this tough environment. Sales declined modestly to  123.5m
(2001 -  127.2m), though in constant currency terms, sales were the same as last year. Overall, we believe that this
represents a better performance than our major competitors. Sales in the Americas were  53.4m (2001 -  56.9m);
sales in Europe were  64.8m (2001 -  60.2m); and sales to the rest of the world were  5.3m (2001 -  10.0m).The
company generated operating profits of  7.5m (2001 -  9.6m) after additional costs arising from the launch of new
products and depreciation on the roll out of business software systems. Management delivered key improvements in
working capital including a substantial reduction in inventory and work in progress.
During the period under review and while depressed economic conditions have applied, management imposed
tight control on the company. In such a climate, the business has the advantage of a high level of repeat activity and
service. Major new clients have been established and there was particular growth in implementations with SAP
enterprise software.
The company is being oriented towards the sale of complete solutions rather than the provision of specialised
hardware.This reflects the continued good performance of our Integration Services Group, which provides solutions
to customers using mobile systems. Psion 2002 / 06 chairman's statement
Chairman's Statement (continued)
Symbian
Symbian made considerable progress during the year, commercially, in its licensing program and in management.
The year saw the beginning of a ramp-up in volume of Symbian-enabled smartphone products that include PDA
functionality, cameras, multi-media messaging, packet-based data, polyphonic sound and colour screens.These
products represent the start of a new generation of phones. During the second half of the year, the first volume
smartphone products began to ship including the Nokia 7650 and the Sony Ericsson P800. Both have been well
received in reviews and in their acceptance by users.There were many announcements of Symbian OS based
products.Among the major handset suppliers, products were announced from Nokia, Siemens and Fujitsu.
Approximately 2.1 million units were shipped in 2002 (2001 - 0.5 million).
In 2002, Symbian's revenues increased substantially to  29.5m (2001 -  17.7m).This included royalties of
 7.7m (2001 -  3.2m). Other revenues of  21.8m (2001 -  14.5m) were predominately charges for consultancy
services related to the implementation of future licensee products.Total gross profit amounted to  12.9m (2001 -
 6.2m).With the large ongoing expenditure in development, Symbian's net overheads were  52.8m leaving a loss
after tax of  37.2m (2001 -  42.1m). Symbian employed 695 staff directly at the end of 2002 (2001 - 625) in
addition to external contractors. Psion's share of Symbian's pre-tax losses of  10.0m has been charged to the
Group's profits.
In market terms, Symbian has a leading share of the evolving smartphone market. Its licensees account for some
75% of world-wide cellphone shipments. Following a substantial four and a half year development, the company is
moving into a new phase of volume shipment and growth.
Symbian ended the year with  21.8m in cash and capital due and on February 17th, 2003, it announced the
accession of Samsung as a 5% shareholder for a cash consideration of  17m. Samsung is a large and growing supplier
in the cellphone industry and their presence as a shareholder adds further to Symbian's strength in the industry.
Subject to unforeseen circumstances, it is expected that Symbian is largely funded. No further investment by Psion
is planned in the current year and any subsequent requirements will be modest.
Board and Management
As reported previously, Ian McElroy will be retiring as Chief Executive of the Group in July. It is our intention
to announce the appointment of a new Chief Executive by that time. Mr. Norbert Dawalibi has been appointed
President of Psion Teklogix and now leads the development of that company. Norbert joined the Group last year after
a long career in IBM and in the telecoms industry.We shall be tabling his election at the AGM to join the Board of
the Group. I am pleased to report that Ian McElroy has agreed to remain on the Board following his retirement as
Chief Executive in a non-executive capacity.
After many years with Psion and having played a central role from the earliest days in the development of the
Group, Dr. Charles Davies will be stepping down to join Symbian as Chief Technical Officer. Charles has played a key
role in the technology development of the Group and has been the leading architect of much of that development.
He remains closely connected with Psion and on behalf of the Board and its shareholders over many years, I would
like to express my gratitude and admiration for all that he has achieved. After eight years of service to Psion initially as Financial Controller and later as Group Finance Director, Marina
Wyatt left the Company in October.The Board is grateful for all that Marina contributed and we wish her well in
her future career. Mr. Bill Jessup, who has wide experience in public companies, was appointed as interim Finance
Director.A permanent appointment will be made once the new Chief Executive is in place.
I am pleased to announce the appointment of Stephen Hill as non-executive director of Psion. Stephen's
experience stems from the media world and most recently he was Chief Executive of the Financial Times Group.
His breadth and experience in business, in media and in electronic content will serve the Group well.
Outlook
The economic environment continues to be constrained.We shall maintain a policy of tight control and cautious
development until corporate investment in information technology begins to expand again.The prospect for the
current year is for a modestly improving performance. It is likely that Symbian will experience substantial growth
and our expectation is to see Symbian established as a successful and leading company in its field.
