 PuriCore reported 2013 revenue growth, primarily due to revenue increases in the Supermarket Retail business, and nearly doubled
EBITDA,* significantly above market expectations. The Company deployed its new growth strategy focused on initiatives to drive
recurring revenue. (Further information on the Company's strategy is on page 5.) Gross margins decreased slightly during the year,
largely due to a one-off inventory write-off. Operating expenses increased as planned due to investment in sales and marketing,
IP associated with the development and launch of new products, and other growth initiatives. PuriCore significantly strengthened its
balance sheet and was debt free at year-end. Loss from continuing operations for the period was reduced to $0.6 million, excluding
a $5.8 million non-cash loss on the reduction of the conversion price on the converted loan.
FOOD & AGRICULTURE
Supermarket Retail: Fresh Produce and Floral
In the Supermarket Retail business, PuriCore continued to expand its customer base with several major contract wins, including a
significant capital equipment order supported by an extended service plan and new concentrate product implementations. These
commercial successes drove a significant increase in revenue for the Supermarket Retail business for the year with a jump of 30.2%
to $28.9 million (2012: $22.2 million). 
During the year, the Company engaged its strategy to drive recurring revenue in the Supermarket Retail business by expanding
product formats and applications. In the fourth quarter, PuriCore launched its second consumable product for this business,
ProduceFresh, a new bottled concentrate option for fresh produce. The product launch coincided with PuriCore's first major
ProduceFresh order: an estimated $13.5 million, four-year agreement with a top-three US supermarket retailer. Revenue for this
agreement initiated in October 2013 and will continue to be booked in the Company's financial accounts through to 2017.
Additionally, PuriCore continued to sell its Sterilox Fresh Systems to customers that prefer on-site generation for large-volume
usage. The Company completed nearly all installations during 2013 for a $14.0 million agreement with a top-five US supermarket
retailer. Under the terms of the agreement, the retailer also purchased a six-year service contract. The majority of the capital revenue
was recorded in the 2013 financial accounts, and revenue related to the service contract will be recognised over the term of the
agreement. 
PuriCore has secured enterprise-wide agreements for its FloraFresh in two major US supermarket retailers. The Company
completed the enterprise-wide roll out of FloraFresh as part of an estimated $7.0 million, four-year agreement with a top-three
retailer that was announced in 2012. Additionally, PuriCore signed an estimated $3.5 million, four-year FloraFresh agreement with
a second major retailer in November 2013. This retailer began using the product in December and is expected to complete full
implementation of its floral programme utilizing FloraFresh in 2014. 
As at year-end, PuriCore held 24% of the market share for Sterilox Fresh Systems and ProduceFresh concentrate in the targeted
supermarkets for the fresh produce application and 8% of the market share for the FloraFresh floral application.
R&D: Agriculture
PuriCore continued to advance its research and development efforts in agriculture. In 2013, the Company initiated an additional
agriculture study focused on wheat but experienced delays due to continuing weather issues in the UK. Once the Directors have
assessed the scope of the commercial opportunity, the Company plans to enter into discussions with appropriate partners.
HEALTH SCIENCES
Endoscopy
The Endoscopy business (including Surgical and Scientific) continued to focus on capitalizing on its strong presence in the UK
National Health Service (NHS) hospitals and to manage costs to maximise profitability. During the period, Endoscopy revenue was
$23.3 million (2012: $23.5 million), which represents a 0.5% increase at constant currency. Revenue remained relatively flat as the
business invested in new products to satisfy changing market needs. The Company continued to focus on increasing recurring
revenue, including services and consumables, which represented 79% of sales for the year (2012: 78%). 
PuriCore continues its strategy to grow the UK market share beyond the current 300 hospitals in the NHS system and is targeting
expansion into Europe. Following the purchase of Monmouth Surgical in 2012, PuriCore has expanded product offerings, which are
now available in its new Surgical catalogue. The Endoscopy business continues to develop best-in-class products with the launch of
the leading-edge Endoscope Storage and Drying Cabinets in 2013. Additionally, the Company is preparing for launch in the second
quarter of 2014 of its new state-of-the-art endoscope washer disinfector, RapidAER,  which received CE Marking in the first
quarter of 2014. Sales activities for this new AER offering are already underway. 
STRATEGIC REPORT
Chairman's Report
2 Wound Care and Dermatology
Revenue in the Wound Care and Dermatology business (including Animal Health and Dental) increased by 53.0% to $2.6 million
(2012: $1.7 million) through marketing partnership successes, including milestone payments. 
PuriCore entered two new US marketing partnerships in the first half of 2013 and a Middle East and North Africa (MENA) partnership
in the first quarter of 2014. The Company also continued to expand indications and product formats, including the newly launched
Animal Health application, as well as to pursue European expansion and rest-of-world opportunities.
The marketing partnerships with SteadMed Medical for Vashe Wound Therapy in North America and with Onset Dermatologics for
private-labelled Dermatology products in the US were established as the commercial arm of the franchise. In October 2013,
PuriCore terminated its distribution agreement for a private-label version of its Wound Care solution for use principally in conjunction
with the Misonix line of ultrasonic systems, and SteadMed Medical now serves as the marketing partner for this application. In
February 2014, PuriCore signed a marketing and distribution agreement with Ueno Corporation for Vashe in 15 Middle East and
North African countries. The agreement is targeted to generate approximately $9.0 million in Vashe revenue to PuriCore over the
next three years. Initial shipments commenced in the first quarter of 2014. 
In February 2013, PuriCore announced it received US FDA regulatory clearance for Vashe Skin and Wound Hydrogel formulation for
the management and relief of pain, burning, and itching experienced with various dermatoses including atopic dermatitis. This
clearance was a key milestone in PuriCore's marketing partnership with Onset Dermatologics and can be used also in Animal Health
applications. PuriCore received an additional FDA regulatory clearance to further refine claims and to extend the shelf-life of the
Vashe products.
In October 2013, PuriCore entered the US Animal Health market with the launch of NovaZo Animal Health Wound Irrigation Solution.
The Company has focused initially on the US market utilizing a contract sales team and will pursue international partners for this new
market. In April 2014, PuriCore launched a complementary product for the Animal Health market, NovaZo Wound Hydrogel
Dressing.
OUTLOOK
The Company remains focused on its growth strategy of delivering more predictable recurring revenue and improving margins
(further information is on page 5). In the Supermarket Retail sector, PuriCore plans to invest strategically in the business to expand
the sales force and drive growth in revenue and product usage of ProduceFresh. Additionally, PuriCore will place more attention on
the Floral market, increasing resources to drive FloraFresh sales and expand the target market to florists and into the supply chain
with importers and distributors. Consistent with market expectations, revenue is expected to soften in the short term as PuriCore
balances declining revenue from capital equipment and grows consumables and other recurring revenue. In the UK, PuriCore
remains focused on growing recurring revenue and on marketing its new Storage and Drying Cabinets and the new RapidAER,
which will open the door for international expansion. The new US and Middle Eastern partnerships in Health Sciences, plus other
international partnerships being pursued in all business areas, offer PuriCore the opportunity to leverage greater marketing resources
with targeted investment whilst delivering increased licensing and product revenue. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank the PuriCore team in the UK and the US for their outstanding work, diligence, and
determination to continue to improve PuriCore's top- and bottom-line performance. In addition, we thank our shareholders for their
continued commitment to the Company and their belief in the potential of PuriCore's technology.
