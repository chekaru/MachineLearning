 Statement from the Chairman and Chief Executive
18 RAC plc Annual report and accounts 2004 
building on 
our strengths 
The continuing RAC businesses have
been growing rapidly and it is
encouraging that in 2004 the profits in
these continuing businesses, excluding
the contribution from Paccar , grew by
12% to  71.2 million (2003 -  63.6
million). In 2004 the profit contribution
from our Paccar contract reduced to
 17.4 million (2003 -  25.6 million). 
Revenue growth from continuing
operations was strong, up 8% to
 1,509.1 million (2003 -  1,401.5 million).
T otal revenues increased by 1% to
 1,539.4 million (2003 -  1,526.2 million)
reflecting the disposal of our mechanical
handling businesses.
Profit before goodwill amortisation,
exceptional items and taxation grew by
2% to  88.6 million (2003 -  86.7 million).
This reflected the  8.2 million reduction 
in the Paccar contribution as well as
restructuring charges of  4.4 million
relating to the integration of the AXA
Direct business and other business
efficiency improvements, and costs 
of  2.0 million in relation to the
implementation of the Insurance
Mediation Directive. Earnings per share
on this basis increased by 2% to 55.7p
(2003 - 54.4p). 
After exceptional items, primarily
associated with business disposals 
We have strong brands in RAC, Lex 
and BSM. Our strategy is to deliver
growth by leveraging their strength and
our customer base. During 2004, we
undertook extensive research on the
RAC brand, and were pleased when it
confirmed that our customers find us one
of the most trustworthy brands in the UK,
and rated us excellent for service. The
internal research was confirmed by
external awards, with our success as
Number 1 in customer satisfaction in the
annual JD Power study and a near clean
sweep for all our brands in the annual
Fleet Excellence awards.
Our most important strategic step in
2004 was the restoration, in the autumn,
of full ownership of our Financial Services
business, through buying out our joint
venture with AXA and the associated
acquisition of renewal rights to AXA
Direct's motor and home insurance
policyholders. With a highly trusted brand
we are ambitious in financial services.
For a number of years, the company 
has anticipated the cessation of our parts
distribution relationship with Paccar , the
worldwide truck manufacturer . A
disengagement was agreed in November
2004, although it will be late 2005 before
this is completed. This will mark the
conclusion of a highly cash generative
trading relationship.
Our goal is to be
regarded by our
customers as providing
the  best in motoring
services' and we will
achieve this through
delivering inspirational
service to them.
Peter Smith Chairman Andrew Harrison Chief Executive
and VA T repayments from prior periods, 
profit before tax was  77.7 million (2003 -
 25.7 million) and earnings per share
calculated in accordance with FRS 14
were 45.8p (2003 - 8.3p).
The company continued to generate
cash, despite investing  31 million in the
AXA transaction and injecting capital into
Lex Vehicle Leasing to support the Ford
Financial transaction. Net debt fell by
 14.5 million to  139.8 million (2003 -
 154.3 million).
The Board proposes a final year dividend
of 15.6p to bring the total dividend for the
year to 25.8p, an increase of 6.2% on
2003 (24.3p).
Operating highlights 
Consumer Services RAC Consumer
Services made progress in 2004, with
total revenues of  374.8 million, up 6%
(2003 -  353.1million). Underlying profits
after adjusting for restructuring charges
associated with the integration of AXA
and other business efficiency
improvements, and the costs of
implementing the Insurance Mediation
Directive, increased by 5%.
T otal revenues in our Motoring Services
businesses were up 29% with strong
performances from Financial Services,
Legal Services and BSM. Our Roadside RAC plc Annual report and accounts 2004 19
business grew revenue by 3%, although
membership growth was constrained by
process issues which affected customer
payment collection and call centre service
and had an impact on membership
renewals. We have made good progress
in resolving these issues and anticipate 
a return to membership growth in 2005. 
We took a major step in our financial
services strategy through acquiring the
renewal rights to AXA Direct's 270,000
motor and home insurance policyholders,
and regaining control of the RAC Financial
Services brand, previously jointly owned
with AXA. Costs of  1.9 million were
incurred during the year in integrating 
the business. This acquisition should
increase our motor , home and personal
insurance book to approximately
450,000 policies by the end of 2005.
T o further accelerate our Roadside,
Financial and Legal Services businesses,
we will be spending an additional 
 5 million on marketing for 2005, funded
by business efficiency improvements.
RAC Auto Windscreens has experienced
challenging trading conditions, reflected
in pressure on margins and the loss of
some insurance customers who elected
to change to single source supplier
agreements. Nevertheless the business
has stabilised and there have been
encouraging signs of success in our
sales activities, most notably at the end
of 2004 with Co-operative Insurance
Services, where we have become the
preferred supplier for all its automotive
glazing repair and replacement work. 
We prepared for the introduction of the
Insurance Mediation Directive, which
came into force in January 2005, and
brings parts of the company, including 
our Roadside business, under Financial
Services Authority regulation for the first
time. The costs associated with this for
2004 were  2.0 million, and a similar
figure will be incurred in 2005 as a
continuing operating cost. We also
embarked on a business efficiency
improvement programme at the end 
of 2004, which incurred one off costs 
of  2.5 million.
Nick Hughes has been appointed as
Managing Director of RAC Consumer
Services with effect from 1 May 2005.

where he has been European Head of
Marketing for the last three years. His

8% to  1,131.8 million (2003 -  1,045.1
million) and profits, after absorbing the
Paccar reduction, increasing by 3% to
 54.7 million (2003 -  53.0 million). 
We continued to increase the services we
sell into the business to business market
- in particular , the work we carry out in
claims handling for the insurance market,
and services to motor manufacturers,
including an agreement to manage
service bookings for a major UK motor
manufacturer . RAC Business Solutions

(2003 -  160.8 million) and increased
profits by 271% from  1.4 million in 2003
to  5.3 million.
Lex Vehicle Leasing, our joint venture
with HBOS, had another good year , 
with an increase in fleet size of 21% 
to 123,600 vehicles (2003 - 102,300
vehicles). The successful integration of
the Ford Financial contract announced 
at the end of 2003 and good organic fleet
growth, resulted in a 17% improvement
in revenues to  241.8 million (2003 -
 207.2 million) with profits up 16% at
 22.7 million (2003 -  19.6 million).
Within Manufacturing Support Services,
Hyundai increased its sales by 16%,
significantly outperforming the new 
car market as a whole. We remain the
preferred bidder , in partnership with
Amey, for the Ministry of Defence's 15
year,  500 million C Vehicle contract -
anticipated to be awarded in early 2005. 
This year we also completed the exiting
of our mechanical handling business
through the disposal of Lex Komatsu
South, Lex Havelange in Belgium and
Lex Manutention in France. We also
negotiated the management buy-out 
of Isuzu T ruck and disposed of 
Mulitpart Universal.
Our people Core to our business
success is the service we deliver to our
customers, and we have a strong belief 
in the role that our colleagues play in
achieving service excellence. In 2004 
we were pleased to receive further
recognition of the positive steps we 
are taking towards our aim of delivering
inspirational service - internally, we
achieved an increase in overall colleague
satisfaction, and externally received a
record number of customer service
awards across our consumer and
business services. We are grateful to 
all our colleagues who have delivered
outstanding service to our customers
throughout the year .
Public policy RAC has been
synonymous with motoring for over 
a century and continues to provide
comment on the key issues of the day -
from congestion and road safety, to
driving standards and transport
investment. In conjunction with our
partners at the RAC Foundation, we
engage at all levels of government and
through the media to promote the
interests of motorists.
Our annual  Report on Motoring' is now 
in its 16th year . Our 2005 report looks 
at the various agonies and ecstasies of
motoring today. The report investigates
the major factors impacting negatively 
on the motorist, focusing particularly 
on those representing the biggest
challenges to policy makers looking to
make our roads safer . By focusing on
these major road safety factors, the RAC
Report on Motoring supports the current
legislative agenda which aims to reduce
the 38,000 deaths and serious injuries
that are suffered on our roads every year ,
and so make them a safer and more
enjoyable place to be. 
Outlook Over the past three years our
continuing operating profits, excluding
the discontinuing Paccar income, have
grown by 12% pa. In 2004 we delivered
good revenue growth in both Consumer
and Business Services driven by the
strength of our brands, our customer
base, and improvements in customer
service. We have started the new
financial year well and remain confident 
in our future prospects.
