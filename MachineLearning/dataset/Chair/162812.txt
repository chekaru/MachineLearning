Chairman's Statement
Introduction
The Group has continued to make progress, despite the current 
economic environment and the short-term challenge of integrating a 
major acquisition. Since 2006 Group revenues have grown fourfold 
from  31.6 million to  129 million, adjusted PBT has increased 
over eight times to  6.5 million and the Group remains focused 
on attractive growing markets with high barriers to entry. These 
markets offer the prospect of long-term growth and our model of 
direct delivery continues to be the key differentiator.
In the year under review we have focused on our key markets 
in energy, defence and process services. In 2010 we will be 
consolidating our engineering businesses under the Redhall brand 
to strengthen the scope of our service offering to our major clients. 
We believe our strategy of acquiring, developing and integrating 
our engineering services is one that is attractive to our clients and 
provides a strong basis for long-term growth. In particular, the 
continued need for investment in the UK's energy infrastructure and 
the ongoing maintenance of these critical assets provide potential 
for future sustainable growth.
2008/09 has been a year of challenges. The loss of our Sea Dragon 
contract early in the year was a setback although steps were taken 
to replace the order book. During the last quarter we experienced 
a slowdown in the oil and gas sector. The civil nuclear market went 
through significant change with the appointment of the new Sellafield 
Parent Body Organisation which led to a hiatus on decision making. 
We are however encouraged that our recent announcement on 
nuclear contract wins incorporating  5 million of work at Sellafield is 
an indication that the hiatus is over.
The process sector suffered as macro-economic decisions 
influenced expenditure but measures have been taken to adapt our 
model to drive efficiencies in delivery and to focus on higher value 
process design and project management.
The above was countered by strong performances in oil and gas for 
infrastructure maintenance, tankage and specialist blast equipment 
and the further developments in our defence operations, particularly 
at the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE ) at Aldermaston.
The Group retains its financial strength and growth perspective 
although we proceed more cautiously due to the difficulty of 
predicting the macro-economic environment and its effect on clients 
both in the public and private sectors. The client feedback we 
receive gives us confidence that we will continue to deliver growth 
in 2010.
Trading Results
The results for the year incorporate eleven months trading of 
Chieftain Group plc acquired on 31 October 2008.
Revenue for the year ended 30 September 2009 increased by 49% 
to  129.0 million (2008:  86.7 million). Adjusted profit before tax 
which excludes exceptional items and amortisation of intangible 
assets stood at  6.5 million, up 39% from the comparative of
 4.6 million.
The adjusted operating margin achieved was 5.2% compared to 
5.4% in 2008. Adjusted fully taxed and fully diluted earnings per 
share stood at 16.0p per share compared to 15.4p in 2008, an 
increase of 3.5%.
Segmental Analysis of Trading
Energy
Energy represented 51% of Group revenue at  65.6 million with 
adjusted operating profit* of  4.9 million. The margin achieved was 
7.5%. Turnover is up 35% from a 2008 level of  48.4 million and 
adjusted profit up 26% (2008:  3.9 million). The principal contributors 
in the year were two major projects at Sellafield and our work on UK 
oil and gas infrastructure projects.

Defence
Defence incorporates our work at Aldermaston and Burghfield 
for AWE and at Barrow for BAE Systems and represented 19% 
of Group revenue in the year with sales of  24.7 million up 134% 
(2008:  10.5 million). Adjusted operating profit* of  1.7 million is 
up 115% on 2008 ( 0.8 million). Operating margin of 7.0% was 
achieved on this revenue (2008: 7.6%) with the reduction being due 
to lower margin Chieftain work. 
Process
Process operations include engineering services to the food and 
chemical sectors and account for 30% of Group revenue. A margin 
of 5.6% (2008: 7.9%) was achieved on revenue of  38.7 million, up 
40% on the 2008 figure of  27.8 million. Adjusted operating profit* 
was flat at  2.2 million reflecting a more difficult market place. The 
major project undertaken in the year was the  9.0 million design 
and build carbon fibre line for Bluestar Fibres. 
Note: *Adjusted operating profit is prior to amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets, exceptional items and central overhead.
Financial Position
The Group remains in a strong financial position with net assets of 
 42.9 million (2008:  20.8 million) and net cash at the year-end of 
 6.3 million (2008:  1.9 million). Our cash conversion of operating 
profit once again was excellent with cash generated from operations 
of  5.4 million representing 80% of our adjusted operating profit. 
Our average cash conversion over the last three financial years
is 99%.
We currently have unutilised bank facilities of  8.5 million with 
Lloyds Banking Group Plc in addition to  10.6 million gross cash 
in hand at the year-end (2008:  6.7 million). These facilities are due 
for renewal in April 2012. The strength of our financial position is 
an increasingly critical factor in a client's assessment of a tendering 
proposal.
The Group's effective rate of tax in the year was 20.2% (2008: 
17.7%), reflecting continued use of the losses brought forward. The 
unutilised losses now stand at  1.9 million and it is anticipated that 
the effective rate of tax next year will be in the region of 25%.
The IAS19 pension deficit increased to  2.2 million at the year-end 
(2008:  0.9 million), resulting primarily from a reduction in the rate 
used to discount liabilities. The triennial valuation of the defined 
benefit pension scheme as at April 2009 is currently ongoing and 
will be concluded during the current financial year.
Dividend
The Board has proposed the payment of a dividend of 4.4p per 
share for the year of which 1.65p has already been paid as an interim 
dividend. This represents an increase of 10% on last year's dividend 
of 4.0p and confirms the Board's confidence in the future trading 
of the business and its ability to generate cash from operations. 
The dividend remains in line with the Board's declared policy of a 
minimum of three times cover on taxed earnings. The final dividend 
of 2.75p per share will be paid to shareholders on 11 February 2010 
who are on the register on 15 January 2010.

Chairman's Statement
People
The Group employs some of the most highly skilled mechanical 
and electrical engineers in the UK. It is because of their skill 
and commitment that we are able to sustain long-term working 
relationships with key clients.
Our staff continue to operate at the highest level in some extremely 
hazardous areas and continue to work in the safest manner 
possible. Overall the safety record in our Group is excellent and at 
Sellafield and Aldermaston it is impeccable. Our congratulations go 
to our staff for achieving such high standards in difficult operating 
environments.
We believe the recent senior management changes leave the Group 
with a stronger management team. This team will concentrate on 
the achievable but will continue to pursue the goal of moving up the 
supply chain. 
Future Prospects
The Group remains well positioned in its core markets of Energy 
(nuclear, oil, gas, and power), Defence and Process (food, chemical 
and pharmaceutical). These markets offer the prospect of long-term 
growth and our model of direct delivery continues to be the key 
differentiator between ourselves and much of our competition. What 
is becoming more evident is that clients want the assurance of the 
Redhall name and balance sheet to enable us to tender for larger 
projects and during the course of the next twelve months we will be 
consolidating our oil and gas contracting operations into one trading 
entity, Redhall Engineering. We anticipate worthwhile reductions in 
overhead costs with these changes. 
We are encouraged by recent Government announcements which 
endorse that we have positioned the business in the right sectors 
and with the right skills to take advantage of the nuclear new build 
programme when it arrives both in terms of modular construction 
and on-site activity.
In addition to our established markets, we are entering new areas 
of expertise in waste to energy and carbon fibre which are rapidly 
expanding markets. We anticipate these new areas of activity will 
become increasingly important in the coming years.
We continue to examine acquisition opportunities. In the short-term 
these will be confined to relatively small add-ons to existing areas of 
activity. 
We have commenced the new financial year with trading in line with 
management expectations and an order book of  115 million (2008: 
 110 million). The combination of a strong balance sheet and a 
quality order book and bid pipeline gives us confidence that we can 
continue to make progress in the coming year.
