Chairman' s statement
Reed Elsevier executed well  
on  its strategic and financial 
priorities in 2012. Positive  
revenue momentum and focus  
on operating efficiency combined 
to lift underlying operating profit 
growth and earnings. 
We continued to strengthen our balance sheet while maintaining 
organic investment and sharpening the focus of our business.  
We are recommending a 7% increase in the full year dividends for 
both Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV, reflecting our 
confidence in the long term outlook for Reed Elsevier . 
Underlying revenues, which exclude the effects of currency 
translation, acquisitions and disposals, grew +4%, or +3% excluding 
the cycling effect of biennial exhibitions, with all five business areas 
contributing to underlying growth. Our reported revenues grew 
+2% to  6, 1 16m expressed in sterling and +9% to  7 ,523m 
expressed in euros, or up +3% at constant exchange rates. 
Underlying adjusted operating profits grew +6%, with the 
improvement in profitability driven by a combination of process 
innovation and portfolio development across all business areas. 
Expressed in sterling, adjusted operating profits grew +5% to 
 1,713m, or +13% to  2,107m expressed in euros. 
Adjusted earnings per share grew +7% to 50. 1p for Reed Elsevier 
PLC, and +14% to  0.95 for Reed Elsevier NV. Reported earnings 
per share grew +42% to 46.0p for Reed Elsevier PLC, and +53% 
to  0.471 for Reed Elsevier NV. 
Share buybacks
During the year we disposed of a number of businesses that no 
longer fit our strategy and used the gross proceeds to buy back 
shares. In 2012 we deployed a total of  250m on share buybacks, 
and by the end of February 2013 we had deployed an additional 
 100m. Based on our strong financial position and planned 
disposals we intend to complete a further  300m of share 
buybacks in the remainder of 2013. 
Dividends
The Boards are recommending equalised final dividends of 17.0p 
for Reed Elsevier PLC and  0.337 for Reed Elsevier NV, up 
respectively 7% and 3% against the prior year .  This brings the total 
dividends for the year to 23.0p for Reed Elsevier PLC, up 7% and 
 0.467 for Elsevier NV, also up 7%.  The differing growth rates of 
the interim and final dividends for the two parent companies 
reflect movements in the sterling-euro exchange rate between 
dividend announcement dates.
Balance sheet
Net debt was  3.1bn/ 3.8bn on 31 December 2012, down from 
 3.4bn/ 4.1bn last year . Net debt/EBITDA for 2012 was 2.2x, 
down from 2.3x last year , and on an unadjusted basis, it was 1.7x, 
down from 1.8x last year . The rate of adjusted operating cash flow 
conversion was 94%, up from 93% in 2011, with capital expenditure 
at 5.5% of revenues.
Board succession
In December , our longstanding Chief Financial Officer , Mark 
Armour retired from the Boards of Reed Elsevier . I would like to 
thank him for his outstanding service over 16 years and wish him 
every good fortune in retirement. Following a rigorous search 
process, Duncan Palmer joined in August and was appointed 
Chief Financial Officer in November . He was previously at 
Owens Corning where he was chief financial officer and senior vice 
president from 2007 having previously held various senior finance 
positions within Royal Dutch Shell for 20 years in the UK, the 
Netherlands and the US. I would like to welcome Duncan to our 
Boards.  His enormous breadth of global business experience, 
gained while living in our three largest office locations, makes him 
uniquely qualified to be Chief Financial Officer of Reed Elsevier .
During the year , we also continued the process of progressively 
refreshing the non-executive element of the Boards. Mark Elliott 
and Sir David Reid will retire as non-executive Directors after ten 
years of valuable service following the conclusion of the Annual 
General Meetings in April 2013.  After a search process using 
external consultants, Linda Sanford joined the Boards in 
December .  She has over 35 years' experience as a global 
executive with IBM and, with her experience particularly in 
leveraging technology to achieve business transformation, she 
is already proving to be a valuable non-executive Director . After 
a further search, in February 2013 we announced that Dr Wolfhart 
Hauser will join the Boards subject to shareholder approval at our 
AGMs in April.  With his more than 30 years' service in executive 
and non-executive positions in international technology and 
services businesses and his background in science and medicine, 
he will be an excellent addition to our Boards. I would like to thank 
Mark and David for their wise advice and assistance over many 
years and to welcome Linda and Wolfhart to Reed Elsevier . 
Corporate responsibility
Our focus on corporate responsibility is a source of strength for 
Reed Elsevier . I fully support all our efforts to ensure the highest 
levels of ethical management.  Our actions indicate that we are 
implementing our commitment to increase the diversity of our 
Boards.

year and assets held for sale. Constant currency growth rates are based on 2011 full year average and hedge exchange rates.
