Chairman's statement
Highlights
    Breakeven point of the Company has 
substantially reduced due to cost reduction. 
Administration costs down by 39% and 
development costs down by 81%.
    Major new licensees appointed.
    Improved balance sheet. Current liabilities 
reduced by 23% despite credit crunch.
Financials
We can take some significant positives for 
the future from 2009 despite showing a 
disappointing drop of 39% in sales. In particular 
these positives were as we spell out below 
- a dramatic reduction in costs, bringing the 
Company's breakeven point down significantly, 
an improved balance sheet and further 
distributors signed up. 
The sales drop was primarily the result of the 
fact that we had received very large orders 
from our North American licensee in the first 
half of 2008, which satisfied its demand into 
2009. As we then only had Metagenics and 
Golgi as distributors, clearly our sales pattern 
was significantly influenced by this. Since then, 
however, we have signed further contracts with 
new licensees and this makes us much less 
dependent on any one single distributor. As 
sales in the second half of 2009 were  46,000 
(the fourth quarter were  26,000), and quarterly 
sales in the first quarter of 2010 are above that 
level, we may now have reached a situation 
where we have sufficient contracts to even out 
quarterly sales. 
Most importantly, however, our loss before tax 
for the year was almost halved from  1.5 million 
to  758,000. This was achieved by significant 
reduction in costs and allowed the Company 
to continue to operate on reduced parameters 
and also lowered the breakeven point for the 
Company. I would remind Shareholders that the 
loss in 2007 was  2.6 million. This fall in costs 
reflects the action taken in early 2008 to enable 
the Company to survive the very difficult funding 
conditions following the severe economic crisis. 
This continues although perhaps lessening in 
severity. In specific terms the items were: 
1. Administrative costs reduced by 39% from 
 1,176,224 to  719,569. Included within 
administrative costs are non-cash items 
of  238,774 so the cash expenditure on 
administration was actually  480,795. The 
largest reduction within this item was staff 
costs, which in cash terms were reduced 
from  457,056 to  262,271 in 2009. 
2. Development costs reduced by 81% 
from  411,938 to  79,648. This reflected 
the slowing down of our development 
programme as we seek to exploit it 
commercially. As we show under Scientific 
Development there was actually some 
further development work taking place which 
was of no cost to ReGen.
Turning now to the balance sheet our total 
current liabilities have been reduced by 23% 
from  541,491 to  416,511. In view of the 
restricted capital markets during 2009 we regard 
this as a significant achievement and have 
plans in hand to reduce this still further. During 
2009 we raised  691,185 and this enabled the 
Company to continue rolling out Colostrinin  
and improving its balance sheet to a limited 
extent. 
Commercial development
Colostrinin  roll out widens - New 
Developments:
Cyprus
The agreement with Golgi Pharmaceuticals 
Ltd of Cyprus under the brand name  Cognase' 
was extended on 25 March 2009 to allow them 
to distribute Colostrinin  in Greece and other 
Balkan countries. On the same day a further 
agreement was signed with Golgi to allow them 
to tablet and package Colostrinin  in Cyprus. As  3 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
18118	 26/05/10	 Proof	2
part of this arrangement Golgi directly invested 
 28,000 in cash into ReGen in exchange for 
700,000 shares priced at 4p per share. This 
represented at the time 3.4% of the enlarged 
share capital of the Company and was a 33% 
premium to the previous placing on  
2 March 2009.
Poland
Following the test marketing by Tagerr, a 
professional services and trading company 
established in Cologne, Germany, Tagerr has 
successfully launched Colostrinin  in Poland 
and has been slowly increasing its demand. 
Turkey
On 29 January 2009 ReGen signed an 
agreement with Eczacibasi Ilac Pazarlama 
A.S., a leading Turkish industrials group, as the 
exclusive distributor of its nutraceutical product 
Colostrinin , under the brand name  Dyna' 
in the Republic of Turkey. Eczacibasi is now 
launching  Dyna' in Turkey and has paid ReGen 
a $50,000 milestone payment. Net revenues 
to ReGen from Eczacibasi pursuant to the 
minimum annual purchase commitments in 
the distribution agreement are estimated to be 
$52,000 in the first year after regulatory approval 
is obtained and $104,000 in the second year. 
India
On 27 April 2010 ReGen signed a Supply 
Agreement with an Indian Company based in 
Mumbai, India.
The ReGen Board regards this as a crucial step 
for two reasons. Firstly, it provides entry into 
the second most heavily populated market in 
the world and one where self treatment is an 
integral part of healthcare. Secondly, India, along 
with China, is one of the two major growth 
drivers of the world economy. Thus, for these 
reasons a consumer launch in this market has 
significant potential for ReGen's long-term 
profitability.
UK
PRG Nutraceuticals Limited launched 
 MemoryAid' in the UK via the internet on the 
1 October 2009.
China
China, with India, is a major potential market 
for ReGen, both because of its size and a 
tradition of self medication. We are currently 
engaging ICUK (a UK based British and Chinese 
Government Consultancy) to introduce us to key 
players in the Chinese market.
Existing Licensees
Our major partner is still Metagenics Inc., who 
were taken over by Alticor during 2009. This 
takeover would have contributed to the fact 
that they did not reorder active material from 
us for almost one year. An additional problem 
was that for a period of time Colostrinin  fell 
foul of a review of the Australian regulations 
relating to colostrum products which meant it 
could not be sold in Australia, by Metagenics's 
subsidiary company who order through the US. 
This problem has now been resolved. We now 
are led to believe there will be a relaunch of 
Colostrinin  in the US in the latter half of 2010. 
Scientific development
Although ReGen has cut back its research 
spending, as it now believes it is time to 
capitalise on its research output, some research 
carried out in prior periods was reported in 2009. 
Also some of our former paid collaborators have 
continued to produce research out of their own 
funding. 
Colostrinin :
In the autumn of 2007 we announced that 
a micro array analysis of peptides derived 
from Colostrinin  at the University of Texas 
Medical Branch (UTMB) had shown that 
certain peptides had a capacity to change gene 
expression in areas involved in obesity and 
Alzheimer's disease. It was therefore decided 
to explore certain peptides further with a view 
to developing them to the status of pre-clinical 
pharmaceutical candidates. On 12 March 2009 
we announced the successful completion of the 
first stage of this exercise.
Alzheimer's disease:
In an in vitro study using neuronal cells two 
synthetic peptides (RG-01 and RG-018) have 
shown significant impact on expression of  4 Annual Report and Accounts 2009
18118	 26/05/10	 Proof	2
genes involved in beta-amyloid generation and 
degradation pathways. Controlling beta-amyloid 
generation could have important implications in 
Alzheimer's disease.
Anti-obesity:
In an in-vivo study on obesity Colostrinin , as 
well as three peptides in combination, have 
been shown to significantly reduce the body 
weight gain of mice when fed a high fat diet 
(HFD). 
The obesity data could be used to create 
another nutraceutical product and indeed a large 
European food company is considering doing 
further work on this. 
Backing up the work in Alzheimer's disease 
Professor Michael Stewart of the Open 
University has co-authored a paper showing 
further evidence of Colostrinin  activity in 
reducing cytotoxicity related to Alzheimer's 
disease. Professor Stewart said:
Alzheimer's disease is the most common 
form of dementia affecting 18 million people 
worldwide. It is characterised by extra cellular 
senile plaques consisting mainly of aggregated 
amyloid-beta and intracellular neurofibrillary 
tangles containing the cytoskeletal protein tau. 
A recent study by Froud et al. in Journal of 
Alzheimer's Disease

 has demonstrated that 
Colostrinin  significantly relieves amyloid-beta 
induced cytoxicity .
Zolpidem:
A study confirming the zolpidem effect in brain 
damage was presented at the 4th International 
Congress on Brain and Behaviour on 3 - 6 
December 2009 in Thessaloniki, Greece by  
Dr Ralf Clauss. 23 of 41 consecutive adult 
patients, at least 6 months after brain damage, 
were selected as neurologically disabled patients 
after scoring less than 100/100 on the Barthel 
Index. Causes of brain damage included stroke 
(12 subjects), traumatic brain injury (7 subjects), 
anaphylaxis (2 subjects), drug overdose (1 
subject) and birth injury (1 subject). The selected 
23 patients had a baseline SPECT scan before 
starting daily zolpidem therapy and a second 
within two weeks of therapy, performed 1 hour 
after receiving 10 mg oral zolpidem. Scans 
were designated as improved when at least 
two of three independent assessors detected 
improvement after zolpidem. The rest were 
designated non-improved.
After four months of daily zolpidem therapy, the 
clinical condition of subjects was rated on the 
Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale (TFES) before and 
after zolpidem. The TFES ratings of all subjects 
and scan improvers and non-improvers were 
compared statistically.
Mean overall improvement after zolpidem on 
TFES was 11.3% from 73.4/100 (SD 25.4) to 
62.1/100 (SD 28.8) (p=0.0006). 10/23 (43%) 
improved on SPECT scan after zolpidem. Their 
mean TFES improvement was 19.4% (SD 16.75) 
compared with 5.17% (SD 5.167) in 13/23 
non-improvers (p=0.0081).
Summary
The Company has survived the credit crunch 
by implementing a severe cost reduction 
programme, but as my review of the year shows 
the business side has been expanded despite 
this. We still continue to believe that during 
2010 the Company will move to sustainable 
profitability. 
I would like to thank the Shareholders and in 
particular our funders during 2009 for their very 
significant support at a time when money was 
very difficult to raise.
