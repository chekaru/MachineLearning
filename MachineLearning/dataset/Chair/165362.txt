 8.9m revenue from acquisitions during the year (2010  nil)), 
59% ahead of the  181.6m for last year and, more importantly, 
43% above the previous highest year s revenue of  201.2m 
reported in 2008. All geographic areas saw good progress, with 
growth of 64% in Europe, 57% in the Americas and 61% in the

metrology
There was an extremely strong performance by our 
metrology business during the year, with revenue of  267.0m, 
compared with  162.1m last year, an increase of 65%. There 
was growth across all product lines, with machine tool and 
encoder products showing particularly strong growth. Operating 
profit for this segment was  87.4m, compared with  31.5m 
last year, an increase of 177%. 
During the year the Group acquired a 49% shareholding in 
Measurement Devices Limited (MDL ) at a cost of  3.9m; 
there is agreement that MDL will become a 100% subsidiary in 
2014. Accounting standards require the Group to consolidate its 
results as if the company were a subsidiary, due to the structure 
of the shareholders' agreement. MDL is a metrology company 
whose laser scanner products are primarily marketed in the 
areas of marine positioning, mining, quarrying and surveying.
On 8th April 2011, the Group acquired for  3.8m, a 100% 
shareholding in MTT Investments Limited (MTT ).  MTT 
designs, develops and manufactures additive manufacturing 
and rapid prototyping systems, including selective laser melting, 
metal casting, and vacuum casting machines and processes. 
Based in Stone, Staffordshire, in the UK, MTT has 40 
employees, with subsidiaries in the USA and Italy, and a branch 
office in France. MTT's selective laser melting equipment 
currently has its main markets in aerospace and medical 
devices, but also has potential for use in other sectors. Its 
products are complementary to Renishaw's existing 
technologies and business. Its results have been consolidated 
since the date of acquisition. On 1st July 2011 most of the 
business and assets were transferred to Renishaw plc and is 
now operating as the Renishaw additive manufacturing  
products division.
On 16th June 2011, the Group acquired, for a total 
consideration of  6m, of which  3m is payable in June 2013, 
certain calibration technology and software, together with 
drawings, designs and intellectual property relating to optical 
technology, from Aberlink Innovative Metrology in order to 
expand the Group's technology portfolio.
A number of new products have been launched during the 
year, including Equator , a radical new alternative to traditional 
dedicated gauging. This was launched in March 2011 and has 
been very well received.  5

Healthcare 
Our healthcare operations continue to develop both in our 
longer established spectroscopy business and in our newer 
dental, neuro and diagnostic activities.
Revenue from our healthcare products rose 11% to 
 21.7m (2010  19.5m). Certain areas are still in the 
development phase and, as a result of the continuing research 
and development costs, an operating loss of  8.5m was 
recorded (2010 loss  3.4m).
During the year the Group has made several sales of the 
enhanced surgical robot used for neurosurgical procedures.
Renishaw Diagnostics Limited (RDL ) has released the 
RenDx  research-use-only (RUO ) multiplex assay system, 
providing a highly sensitive and flexible tool to screen for 
multiple targets in a single analysis. RDL is preparing to apply 
for approval of the RenDx  multiplex assay system as an in 
vitro medical device.
We continue to develop our dental business, including our 
collaboration with Biomet 3i, which is now a non-exclusive 
distributor of Renishaw dental scanning and milling systems.

Expenditure for the year on property, plant and equipment 
was  16.5m, of which  5.4m was in respect of property and 
 11.1m was in respect of plant and equipment.
Expenditure on property included:
- The refurbishment of our Charfield premises, purchased in 
2008, which has been occupied by our dental, neurological 
and imaging coil product lines together with a team of 
group software engineers;
- Larger premises in Barcelona for our Spanish sales and 
marketing operation;
- Completion of the expansion of our Indian production 
facility in Pune which opened in March 2011; and
- On 24th June 2011, the Group contracted to purchase 
461,000 sq ft of premises on a site of 193 acres in Miskin, 
South Wales, approximately 55 miles from the New Mills 
head office. This additional space is being acquired to 
secure manufacturing capacity required to accommodate 
future growth. The cost of these new premises will be 
 7.7m, of which  0.7m has been paid as a deposit prior to 
the year end.
The Group's expenditure on plant, equipment and vehicles 
of  11.1m comprised mainly additional machine tools, other 
production machinery and IT investment to support the 
expanding business. Along with  1.6m of tangible fixed assets 
acquired through business acquisitions, the net book value of 
property, plant and equipment increased during the year from 
 70.5m at 30th June 2010 to  82.3m at 30th June 2011. 
The Group has invested heavily in working capital during 
the financial year. Inventories have increased by  18.9m over 
the year, including  3.2m relating to acquisitions, as the Group 
has sought to ensure adequate stock to meet customer 
demands in an environment of growing but unpredictable and 
substantial order intake. At the end of June 2011, inventories 
were  49.8m compared with  30.9m at 30th June 2010. 
The Group continues to have a solid balance sheet, with 
net cash balances of  34.6m at 30th June 2011, compared 
with  31.1m at 30th June 2010. 
awards
The Group has received a number of awards during the 
year including our 14th Queen's Award for Enterprise: 
Innovation 2011. This has been granted for the TRS2  
laser-based tool breakage detection system used on CNC 
machine tools.
The Group has made very considerable progress during the year. There continue to be 
many challenges to be met and overcome, not least the recruitment and absorption 
of new employees, the occupation of new premises, the integration of newly acquired 
companies and the ongoing development of Renishaw technologies. Nevertheless the 
directors confidently expect the current progress of the Group to continue due to the 
increased opportunities and the underlying strength of our markets.

2010 to 2,675 at the end of June 2011, an increase of 576. 
Additional staff have been taken on in all areas, both to support 
the current increase in production as well as to ensure the 
ongoing development programmes in our metrology and 
healthcare businesses. The Group acquired 95 staff through  
the acquisitions of MDL and MTT. There are currently  
267 outstanding vacancies, of which 139 are in the UK  
and 128 overseas.
Your directors are grateful for the tremendous support and

Chairman & Chief Executive
27th July 2011
1: On 24th June 2011, Renishaw exchanged contracts to 
acquire the Bosch manufacturing facility in Miskin, South 
Wales, which offers 461,000 sq ft of existing factory space 
on a 193 acre site.
2  The newly refurbished Renishaw facility at Charfield, close to 
its New Mills headquarters, has 30,000 sq ft of mainly open 
plan space and is clad with composite insulated panelling 
to reduce energy consumption. The building accommodates 
several of the Company's healthcare business divisions - 
dental, neurological and imaging coil products - and includes 
a high-quality staff restaurant.
 
3: The MTT range of additive manufacturing technologies 
includes the SLM250 Selective Laser Melting machine, which 
utilises a pioneering process capable of producing fully dense 
metal parts direct from 3D CAD, using a high-powered laser. 
4: The Dynascan is a 3D mobile mapping system that can be 
mounted onto vehicles and boats to collect data whilst on the 
move, enabling huge savings in time and personnel when 
surveying large areas. 
5: Sir David McMurtry became a Fellow of the Royal Society at 
an admissions ceremony held on 15th July 2011. During the 
ceremony he signed the Society's historic Charter Book  
which since 1663 has recorded the signatures of each new 
Fellow and Foreign Member, including such luminaries as 
Charles Darwin, Isaac Newton, Stephen Hawking and  
Tim Berners-Lee. 
6: On 20th July 2011, Dame Janet Trotter, Lord Lieutenant 
of Gloucestershire, presented Renishaw with a Queen's 
Award for Enterprise in the Innovations category; this is the 
Company's 14th Queen's Award and its fifth in just  
eight years.
