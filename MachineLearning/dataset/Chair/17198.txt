CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
Results for the year ended 31 December 2011
During 2011 the Group achieved revenue of $24.09 million (2010: $21.31 million), an
increase of 13%. These results were due to strong annual performance by the BioSeek
business and benefited as well from the inclusion of a full twelve months of BioSeek
in 2011 (2010: ten months) and an improved 4th quarter performance by the 
non-BioSeek related Tissue Based Solutions business. 
The Group's cost of sales was $11.23 million (2010: $9.33 million), leading to a gross
profit for the year of $12.86 million (2010: $11.98 million profit). As a result, gross
margins were 53% (2010: 56%). 
This revenue growth was achieved while prudently managing costs and keeping
expenditures on normal operations in check. Research and Development (R&D)
expenses were $1.43 million (2010: $1.33 million). All 2011 R&D expenses were
related to improvements to new product offerings to support the Group's focus on the
business of human tissue supply and human tissue based solutions.
Selling and distribution costs were $3.41 million (2010: $3.82 million). These costs
relate to sales staff salaries, commissions and marketing expenses. The modest
decrease is attributable to a reduction in sales staff salaries expense due to attrition
and a renegotiation of our consultant agreement with our Japanese sales and
marketing representative. 
Total general and administrative expenses were $12.55 million (2010: $8.92 million).
General and administrative expenses are analysed between those relating to
exceptional costs and those to normal operations. Costs relating to normal operations
were reduced to $7 .82 million (2010: $8.00 million). 
On 24 October 2011 the commencement of a formal sales process for the Group was
announced. During this process the Group has held discussions with several interested
parties. The Company has not been able to secure an offer for the whole Group,
instead it has signed letters of intent for each of the two businesses in the Tissue
Based Solutions segment: BioSeek and the non-BioSeek Tissue Based Solutions. As
a consequence, the formal sale process has now ended and the Company is no longer
in an Offer Period.
This decision, after the year end, to sell certain elements of the business separately
has resulted in reductions in the carrying value of certain assets, primarily intangible
assets and inventory, as explained further below. These impairment charges reflect
that these financial statements are not prepared on a going concern basis since all
parts of the business are being actively marketed and thus the asset values have been
adjusted to reflect their estimated realisable value.
Exceptional general and administrative costs rose to $4.73 million (2010: $0.92 million)
due to these impairment charges, totalling $3.40 million. Remaining exceptional costs
related to severance, acquisition, litigation and sale costs. 
The Group realised a $8.23 million loss for the year (2010: $2.07 million loss),
including a $1.59 million (2010: $nil) exceptional interest expense relating to the
financing arrangements in place to acquire BioSeek. Loan notes were the agreed form
of payment for the contingent consideration of BioSeek; the interest expense arising
on these are deemed to be exceptional interest.
Although it is a non-IFRS measure, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and
Amortisation (EBITDA) and excluding exceptional items and share option related
charges is monitored closely by the Directors and management as a metric to measure
progress of business operations towards profitability and positive cash flow. The
adjusted EBITDA for 2011 was $1.51 million profit, a $1.53 million improvement over
2010 (2010: $0.02 million loss). An explanation of this calculation can be found on
page 19.
Balance Sheet
At 31 December 2011, the carrying value of the intangible assets was reduced to
$3.31 million due to an impairment charge of $1.29 million to write down the carrying
value of the assets of the non-BioSeek Tissue Based Solutions business to a level of
the expected net proceeds from the business disposal.
On 31 December 2011, the carrying value of the biobank inventory was reduced to
$6.55 million due to an impairment charge of $2.11 million to write down the carrying
value of inventory to the amount implied by the expected recoverable amounts in the
sale of the non-BioSeek Tissue Based Solutions business. 
Cash flows
The Directors monitor the cash flow and cash resources closely. At 31 December 2011,
there had been a $2.94 million reduction in the cash balance as compared to the
previous year (2011: $2.98 million; 2010: $5.92 million). Primary uses of cash
throughout the year included $3.24 million debt and finance lease repayments and
$0.72 million of loan interest paid. 
Financing and liquidity
At 31 December 2011 the Group had cash and cash equivalents of $2.98 million
(2010: $5.92 million). The Group has a $2.30 million term loan with Silicon Valley Bank
and a $6.59 million balance on the loan note with the former BioSeek shareholders.
In October 2011, the Group received notification that these loans were in default. As
announced in October 2011, the Company is currently undergoing a formal sale of all
or part of the business. Our creditors have remained supportive throughout and we
believe the default status will be resolved at the conclusion of the sales process. 
Board changes and corporate governance
During 2011 we announced the departures of Martyn Coombs, the Group's Chief
Executive Officer, John Stchur, the Group's Chief Financial Officer and Jonathan
Fleming, a Non-Executive Director. 
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Martyn, John and Jonathan for their service
over the past years and wish them well in their future endeavours. 
The Board and management continue to have a policy of transparency with regards
to our strategy and related activities. An important component of this involves
communicating and listening to our shareholders to understand their ideas and points
of view. 
Aligning objectives between employees and
shareholders
During 2011, we granted a total of 0.92 million share options to our employees
through our Long Term Incentive Programme. We believe this programme enables us
to retain key employees, while aligning the goals of our shareholders with those of our
employees. Every Asterand employee receives shares under this programme.

Outlook
As previously mentioned, the Group commenced a formal sale process for the issued
capital of the Group in October 2011. The Company has instead signed letters of
intent to sell each of the two businesses: BioSeek and the non-BioSeek Tissue Based
Solutions, separately, and the formal sales process has ended with the Company now
no longer in an Offer Period. Assuming that definitive agreements are executed, the
Board is expected to issue a circular to shareholders in the coming weeks with details
of the proposed transactions. Then the likely process will be disposal of the assets of
each of the two businesses and a solvent liquidation of the Group to return cash to
shareholders. Whilst the level of a liquidation dividend, if any, cannot definitely be
determined at this time, the Board's current estimation, based on the letters of interest
from the buyers and the current share price, is that the maximum payout to
shareholders is unlikely to show a significant premium to the share price as of the close
of business on 26 April 2012.
Revenue for the non-BioSeek portions of the Tissue Based Solutions business, which
had been volatile for most of the year, stabilised in the last quarter of 2011, providing
an increased cash flow over the original estimates. Given these factors, the Directors
have a reasonable expectation that the Company will maintain adequate resources to
continue in operational existence until completion of disposals.
The completion of the disposals is not guaranteed and there is inherent risk that the
sale cannot be completed within the necessary timeframe. In addition, the following
are considered to be further uncertainties related to the disposals:
  Shareholder approval - raising funds through the disposals of all or part of the
Company's assets is predicated on shareholder approval. The Board intends to
convene an Extraordinary General Meeting at which the necessary resolutions will
be put to shareholders. While there is uncertainty over the outcome of these votes,
the Board has a reasonable expectation that approval to proceed with this strategy
will be forthcoming.
  Loan covenants - we are currently in default of our Silicon Valley Bank and former
shareholders of BioSeek loans. We have been in communication with our lenders
and they are in support of resolving the default status at the conclusion of this
process. However, their continued support cannot be guaranteed.
  Trading results - management have prepared budgets and projections which they
believe are prudent and achievable. However, the achievement of these trading
results is uncertain.
Given that the Directors have resolved to sell the two business units separately, a
 going concern' presumption in IAS 1 is not appropriate; therefore the accounts have
been drawn up on a basis which reflects the Directors' intention to sell the two
business units. The management team continues to tightly control operating expenses
to maintain sufficient working capital. In addition, based on discussions with potential
purchasers, the Board believes that it has a reasonable expectation that the disposals
will be completed within an appropriate timeframe.
