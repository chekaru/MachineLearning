Background
The key value creator for Sareum's 
shareholders is the development and 
commercialisation of drug candidates 
from the Company's in-house drug 
development pipeline. 
Progress within Sareum's in-house 
research	programmes,	which	focus	on	
treatments	for	cancer ,	has	been	to	plan .	
This 	 includes 	 successful 	 in-vivo 	 efficacy 	
studies resulting from its collaboration 
with the Institute of Cancer Research 
and Cancer Research Technology Limited. 
A d d i t i o n a l l y , 	 i n 	 t h e 	 p e r i o d 	 u n d e r 	 r e v i e w	
three further patent applications have 
been 	 filed 	 to 	 protect 	 families 	 of 	 promising	
compounds arising from Sareum's 
research programmes. 
At	the	star t	of	the	period,	the	Company	
completed	its	strategic	review ,	initiated	
in	May	2008,	which	resulted	in	the	sale	
of its service business to Galapagos NV 
in	August	2008.	In	addition ,	other	
equipment assets were sold and the 
Company's laboratories were closed. 
Alongside	this,	the	Company	under took	
a major cost and staff reduction 
programme. Whilst it was a difficult 
decision to make the positions of our 
talented	and	dedicated	staff	redundant,	
the Directors believe that a minimal 
fixed cost base is essential to the 
success of the re-structured Company. 
The	Company 's	strategy ,	following	its	
re-structuring,	is	to	concentrate	primarily	
on its in-house cancer drug discovery 
research. This is achieved by outsourcing 
the chemistry and biology components 
o f 	 e a c h 	 p r o g r a m m e . 	 A s 	 b e f o r e , 	 o u r	
in-house expertise and experience is 
used to interpret the relationship between 
chemical structure and biological activity 
associated with each of the compounds 
tested. This leads to the design of new 
molecules which should be more active 
a n d 	 m o r e 	 s p e c i fi c a l l y 	 t a r g e t e d . 	 N o w	
that we have closed the Company's 
laboratories the synthesis and testing 
of new compounds is undertaken in 
third party laboratories.
As the development programmes 
progress and additional data is 
generated,	demonstrating	the	quality	
o f 	 t h e 	 c a n d i d a t e 	 m o l e c u l e s , 	 a 	 v e r y 	 a c t i v e	
campaign continues to draw these results 
to the attention of companies seeking 
to licence programmes such as these. 
I n 	 a d d i t i o n , 	 a s 	 o u r 	 r e s e a r c h 	 i s 	 p r e s e n t e d	
from time-to-time at various conferences 
and	seminars,	we	also	receive	some	
direct approaches from potential 
licensing partners.
Progress with in-house cancer targets
The Company's principal asset 
following the sale of the fee-for-service 
business is its intellectual property 
derived from its cancer drug discovery 
programmes. Sareum has seven drug 
discovery programmes and is actively 
developing three of them at the present 
time. The Company is engaged in 
discussions with a number of potential 
commercial partners involving several 
of these programmes. The Company 
has continued to make positive progress 
with its in-house cancer drug discovery 
programmes,	resulting	in	three	fur ther	
patent applications and the publication 
of	three	patents	from	historic	filings.

Sareum's pipeline is built on the expertise 
o f 	 i t s 	 f o u n d e r s 	 i n 	 p r e - c l i n i c a l 	 d r u g 	 d i s c o v e r y ,	
par ticularly	in	the	field	of	cancer .	Sareum	
concentrates its research on targeted 
small molecule therapeutics. 
Targeted cancer therapies disrupt 
s p e c i fi c 	 b i o c h e m i c a l 	 p r o c e s s e s 	 n e c e s s a r y	
for tumour growth and survival. Because 
these	processes	are	specific	to	cancer	
cells,	targeted	therapies	may	be	more	
effective	than	other	types	of	treatments,	
such	as	chemotherapy	and	radiotherapy ,	
and less harmful to normal cells. 
Some	targeted	therapies,	for	instance	
Checkpoint	Kinase	1	(Chk1)	inhibitors,	
are	designed	to	boost	the	efficacy	of	
chemotherapy .	Others,	such	as	Aurora	
K i n a s e 	 ( A u r o r a ) , 	 F M S - l i k e 	 T y r o s i n e	
Kinase	4	(FL T4,	sometimes	referred	to	
as	V ascular	Endothelial	Growth	F actor	
R e c e p t o r 	 3 	 K i n a s e , 	 V E G F R - 3 ) 	 o r	
FMS-like	T yrosine	Kinase	3	(FL T3)	
inhibitors,	have	the	potential	to	be	
effective by themselves or in 
combination with chemotherapy 
or other targeted therapies. 
Small molecule therapeutics (as opposed 
to biological  drugs such as antibodies) 
are able to penetrate into the interior of 
a cell and thus can be targeted at the 
full range of processes in a biochemical 
pathway. Small molecule anti-cancer 
therapeutics can be designed to target 
one or more of a wide range of biochemical 
processes essential to cancer cells. Small 
molecule therapeutics also have the potential 
of being able to be administered orally 
(e.g. as a pill) rather than by injection.
Our strategy is to focus on developing 
best	in	class	cancer	therapies,	where	
pre-clinical and early clinical data is 
available to indicate that disrupting the 
targeted biochemical process will indeed 
prevent tumour growth and survival 
without	significant	side-effects.	W e	can	
capitalise on these published results 
to direct our own programmes and to 
indicate,	for	instance,	whether	or	not	
the therapy needs to be administered 
in combination with additional 
cancer therapies. 
Cancer cells differ from normal cells in 
m a n y 	 d i f f e r e n t 	 w a y s . 	 I n 	 p a r t i c u l a r , 	 c a n c e r	
cells divide and grow much more rapidly 
than normal cells. Biochemical processes 
targeted by Sareum that control cell 
growth	and	division	include	Chk1,	
Aurora,	FL T3,	P olo -Like	Kinase	(PLK)	
and B-raf. 
Once a solid tumour reaches a certain 
size,	it	needs	to	be	connected	to	the	
body's blood and lymph systems to 
receive nutrients and remove waste. 
Sareum's	programme	targeting	FL T4	
is importantly involved in the generation 
of new blood and lymph vessels to a 
tumour .	FL T4	is	also	involved	in	the	
control	of	metastasis,	the	spread	of	
cancer ,	which	is	the	main	cause	
of death in cancer patients. 
Chk1
This is Sareum's most advanced 
in-house programme and is carried 
out in conjunction with one of the world's 
leading	cancer	research	organisations,	
The Institute of Cancer Research and 
Cancer Research Technologies Limited. 
Significantly ,	we	have	obtained	results	
from in-vivo pre-clinical experiments 
that demonstrate a two-fold increase 
in	the	efficacy	of	marketed	cancer	
chemotherapeutics when combined 
with programme compounds. 
Aurora and FLT4
These programmes are currently 
wholly-owned by the Company. In both 
cases we have developed drug candidates 
that are suitable for testing in in-vivo 
efficacy 	 experiments. 	 These 	 studies 	 are 	
ongoing and we aim to report their 
progress at international cancer 
conferences during the next period. 
Earlier-stage programmes  
(FLT3, FASN, PLK1, B-raf)
These programmes are currently on 
hold,	pending	a	collaborative	research	
deal with a pharmaceutical company 
partner or receipt of a research grant. 
FL T3,	in	addition	to	being	a	potential	
t a r g e t 	 f o r 	 c e r t a i n 	 l e u k a e m i a s , 	 a l s o	
has the potential to treat auto-immune 
diseases such as multiple sclerosis 
and	rheumatoid	ar thritis,	which	fur ther	
expands the commercial opportunities 
for this programme. 
Changes to the Board
Dr Alastair Riddell (Non-executive 
Director),	Giorgio	R eggiani	(F inance	
Director)	and	Dr	David	W illiams	(VP ,	
Biology & Structural Sciences) resigned 
from the Board of the Company during 
the period. We thank them for their 
valuable contribution to the Company 
and wish them well for the future.
Financial review
During	the	period,	revenues	of	 32,000	
were recognised arising from fee-for-service 
collaborations prior to the sale of that part 
of the business.
The loss after taxation decreased 
to  1.1 million (2008:  1.7 million). 
This included one-off re-structuring costs 
of	 360,000	and	par tially	reflects	the	
cost cutting measures resulting from the 
strategic review. The loss after taxation 
for the second half of the period was 
approximately	 250,000	and	this	figure	
broadly translates to the working capital 
requirements of the Company for that 
six month period. The cash position 
at the period end was  0.27 million 
(2008:  0.48 million). Since the 
year end the cash position has been 
significantly	improved	following	the	
share 	 placings, 	 announced 	 in 	 September	
a n d 	 O c t o b e r 	 2 0 0 9 , 	 t h a t 	 r a i s e d 	   8 1 5 , 0 0 0	
before expenses. As a result of these 
p l a c i n g s , 	 t h e 	 D i r e c t o r s 	 b e l i e v e 	 t h e	
Company is able to increase its R&D 
spend to further advance its cancer drug 
pipeline 	 whilst 	 also 	 providing 	 sufficient 	
working capital for the foreseeable future.
Summary 
Despite	difficult	economic	conditions	
a n d 	 t h e 	 s a l e 	 o f 	 i t s 	 f e e - f o r - s e r v i c e 	 b u s i n e s s ,	
the Company has demonstrated that it is 
able to progress its in-house research by 
advancing programmes according to plan 
and by working with our partners to 
develop candidate drug molecules. 
The	first	half	of	this	period	was	a	difficult	
one	for	the	Company ,	but	demonstrated	
the capability of the Board to act decisively 
in the face of adverse market conditions. 
The Directors believe the Company's 
strategy has been further endorsed by the 
participation of those investors that have 
subscribed for new shares in the Placings 
completed after the period end.
Outlook
The Company has an exciting opportunity 
to focus solely on its in-house cancer 
drug	discover y	programmes,	to	generate	
shareholder value. The research work 
for the ongoing programmes is being 
provided	via	third	par ties,	leaving	the	
Company	with	a	much	reduced	fixed	
cost base. 
The Company will continue to build 
value from its in-house research and 
development by seeking to advance 
its cancer drug discovery programmes. 
W ith	sufficient	cash	resources	to	fund	
the ongoing business plan for the 
foreseeable	future,	the	Company	looks	
forward to further development and 
commercialisation of these cancer 
drug programmes.
