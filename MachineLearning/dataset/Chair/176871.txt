 6 Annual review and accounts 2005
Kevin Beeston
Executive Chairman
2005 was an outstanding year for Serco. Markets continue to grow,
primarily driven by governments' needs to control spending and improve
the quality of public services. Our public service ethos and commitment
to partnership enable us to win more than 90% of rebids and 50% of new
bids. This success is built on a firm foundation: consistent, high quality
service to satisfied customers. Our balanced portfolio, spread across our
chosen sectors and international markets, allows us to target the best
opportunities. The forward order book stands at a record level and none 
of our ten highest revenue contracts are due for rebid before the end of
2010. We remain confident of continuing double-digit growth and
increasing margins. 
Chairman's statement  www.serco.com    7
2005 was an outstanding year for Serco. We grew
revenue by 38.1% to  2,260m, with organic growth
of 19.4%. Profit before tax and intangible
amortisation (PBTA) also increased strongly, by
28.5% to  91.5m, with organic PBTA growth of
13.1%. Earnings per share before intangible
amortisation grew 22.9% to 14.09p. After intangible
amortisation, profit before tax grew 21.7% to
 77.9m and earnings per share increased by
15.3% to 11.66p.
The recommended final dividend of 2.06p per
share gives a total for the year of 2.97p, an
increase of 12.9%.
Our cash performance remains strong, with Group
EBITDA to cash conversion of 90% (2004: 93%)
contributing to a Group free cash flow of  73.8m 
for the year (2004:  55.8m).
In total during 2005, we signed contracts and
extensions valued at  2.6bn and we were appointed
preferred bidder for contracts totalling  2.4bn.
We have maintained our win rate of more than 90%
on rebids, demonstrating the quality of service we
deliver to satisfied customers. The highest profile
re-competition during 2005 was the Docklands
Light Railway contract, valued at around  400m
over up to nine years. Additionally, in February 2006
we became preferred bidder for a 15-year contract
valued at around  1bn to provide marine services
to the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD). With these
rebids now signed or at preferred bidder stage,
none of our ten largest contracts by annual revenue
are due for renewal before the end of 2010.
Our record of winning new contracts was also 
excellent. As in previous years, we won more than
50% of new bids in 2005, underlining the strength
of our reputation, our ability to be selective in
targeting new work and continuing innovative
solutions. Amongst many notable wins, we were
appointed preferred bidder for a 35-year contract
valued at around  1.2bn to provide support
services to three hospitals in Leicester, and we
signed a 23-year contract valued at around  400m
to support the MoD's Defence Academy.
Our two largest acquisitions - ITNET (now Serco
Solutions) and RCI (now part of Serco Inc) - had
the anticipated positive impact, adding  333.9m 
to revenue and  23.6m ( 10.3m after funding
costs) to PBTA.

Chairman's statement
The new skills and capabilities they have brought 
to the Group are already delivering benefits. 
For example, Serco Solutions was instrumental in
winning a  125m Small Business Service contract
from the UK Department of Trade and Industry.
Serco Inc is enjoying strong growth and will provide
a platform for expanding our North American
presence into other sectors such as transport.
We are leveraging the benefits of our increasing
scale and achieving efficiencies by centralising the
purchasing of materials and developing a shared
services facility for our back office functions such
as finance and administration. We have streamlined
our management structure, removed unnecessary
bureaucracy and begun the implementation of a
SAP financial system. These initiatives - together
with selective bidding and continued management
of our business portfolio - will benefit our PBTA
margins in 2006 and beyond.
Visibility of future revenue remains excellent. At 31
December 2005, our forward order book stood at a
record  13.4bn and we had visibility of 91% of our
planned revenue for 2006, 77% for 2007 and 64%
for 2008. 
At the same date, we had contracts valued at
 2.6bn at preferred bidder and a further  2.7bn 
of bids where we have been shortlisted to the 
final two or three bidders.  
Favourable drivers worldwide
Our opportunities for growth are created by two
principal drivers: the necessity for central and local
governments to control their spending and their
need to respond to social pressures for improved
public services. 
Our business portfolio, spread across different
sectors and around the world, allows us to target
our resources towards the best opportunities. 
In the UK, the home affairs market is driven by the
change in government focus from implementing
initiatives to the delivery of outcomes - reducing
crime and the fear of crime. We estimate that this
market is worth  2.5bn per annum and growing fast. 
We have created a new position in healthcare,
which is among the largest and fastest growing
areas of UK Government spending - some  89bn
in 2005/6. The Government continues to invest
some  70bn per annum in education and we see
opportunities in children's services and information
and communications technology emerging from
the recent Education Bill. In science, the formation
of the UK's Nuclear Decommissioning Authority
has created a market worth around  2bn per
annum. Most areas of the public sector are seeing
budgetary pressure and in response are changing
the way they work. In UK defence, we expect our
addressable market to double to  8bn per annum
by 2010 as the MoD focuses resources, continues
to civilianise and seeks cost savings.
A similar pattern is emerging in North America, the
largest services market in the world. The market is
estimated at $2,000bn per annum, of which around
one third is at the federal level and the remainder
with state and local governments. The annual US
defence budget is nearly $400bn and rising. Some
market segments are looking at private sector
service provision for the first time and more
established markets such as municipal services
and transportation are moving to more
sophisticated, performance-based contracting as
the emphasis shifts from lowest cost to best value,
a trend which plays to our strengths.
We also see exciting prospects in parts of Europe 
- notably Germany, where economic and political
conditions are accelerating the trend towards
public private partnerships - and the Middle East, 
in particular the United Arab Emirates. In Asia
Pacific, the Australian defence and transport

markets continue to offer good potential, while the
opening of our Shanghai, China office positions us
to explore opportunities as the regional government
pursues its ambitious public service objectives.
Dedicated professionals
People are at the heart of our business. 
Throughout 2005, the dedication, expertise 
and professionalism of Serco colleagues around 
the world were critical to our performance.
Notwithstanding their daily achievements in
bringing service to life, their wholehearted response
to the tsunami in south-east Asia, the London
bombings, the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico 
and the Pakistan earthquake, epitomised the spirit
that defines Serco. 
Board
Since his appointment as a Non-Executive 
Director in April 2000, Ralph Hodge has played 
a vital role in shaping the direction of our business.
As he prepares to step down from the Board, 
we would like to place on record our gratitude for
his contribution. We wish him a long and healthy
retirement.
The Board has approved the appointment of
Leonard V . Broese van Groenou as a Non-Executive
Director, effective from 3 April 2006. We are
delighted to welcome him to Serco.
Continuing positive outlook
Governments around the world are continuing to
face significant pressures to provide better public
services at lower cost and our market opportunities
are unprecedented. In the UK, our growth is being
fuelled by the development of a mixed economy,
which incorporates the private sector in the delivery
of public services, and our ability to deliver
customers' desired outcomes, which enable us 
to develop long term relationships which in turn
drive our organic growth. 
The Group has identified in excess of  21bn 
of opportunities across our markets. The breadth 
of these opportunities, together with our approach
to selective bidding, portfolio management and
efficiency will contribute to increasing margins. 
We are confident of achieving double-digit 
growth for the foreseeable future.
