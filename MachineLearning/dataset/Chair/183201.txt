Annual Report & Accounts 2009 6
ExECUTivE ChAiRmAN'S STATEmENT
The year to March 2009 was a difficult one for Sovereign. 
Very high interest rates and one off adviser charges imposed  
by our Lenders during the year led to cash outflows of over  
 6m and resulted in cash flow challenges at times during the 
year. Very tight control and management of Group cash flow by 
our finance team and subsidiary company management teams 
assured the Board that the Company could meet its financing 
needs through the period. 
The Board continued to pursue refinancing throughout the year 
and was finally able to re-negotiate the terms of existing loans 
with our existing Lenders in May 2009, resulting in significantly 
reduced interest charges and deferral of cash interest payment 
on our Mezzanine loan until June 2010, and these revised 
terms and the support of Lenders will greatly improve working 
capital and cash flow.
The sale and leaseback of some of our buildings, the sale  
of DDS and the sale of Vertec Engineering and the rental cabin 
assets of Labtech Services Ltd subsequent to the period end, 
allowed us to repay  8.4m to Lenders and thus reduce our 
loans and introduce further working capital into the business.
The recently announced sale of Prodrill and sale and leaseback 
of our Headquarters building, as approved by shareholders on 
26 August 2009, will allow us to further deleverage and also 
increase working capital when these transactions complete in 
September 2009. 
We will continue to pursue further strategic disposals to refocus 
the Group as a fabrication business. In line with that policy,  
and after a review of subsidiary valuations, the Board decided 
to write down the values of some Drilling subsidiaries through 
exceptional charges of  3.7m.
As a result, profit performance for the period, after taking all 
these charges, was disappointing, with a loss after taxation  
of  13.1m in 2009 (2008:  7.4m).

Annual Report & Accounts 2009 7
In the light of our overall performance, the Board are not 
recommending the payment of an ordinary dividend. 
Group turnover for the year, however, grew to  96.5m  
(2008:  94.6m) of which  82.8m (2008:  80.2m) is from 
continuing operations.
Diamant Drilling Services S.A., which was sold on 5 March 
2009, and Vertec Engineering Ltd and Labtech's cabin rental 
fleet, which were sold effective 31 March 2009, contributed 
 13.7m to turnover, but they are now discontinued operations. 
Our Fabrication Division performed well again with turnover  
at  67.9m (2008:  68.6m) prior to the sale of Vertec and the 
Labtech cabin rental assets. Continuing operations accounted 
for  59.6m (2008:  61.0m) of this turnover and an EBITDA  
of  2.9m (2008:  5.4m).
During the financial year sales leveled off as the oil price fell 
from over $147 per barrel in July 2008 to below $40 by end 
December 2008, which resulted in a number of our customers 
postponing their projects and developments as they adjusted  
to the much lower oil price. This resulted in a leveling out of 
enquiries and orders in the second half of the year which has 
continued into the current year.
The Drilling Division increased turnover to  28.6m (2008: 
 26.0m) although DDS was sold in March 2009. Continuing 
operations therefore accounted for  23.2m (2008:  19.2m)  
of that turnover and had an EBITDA loss of  0.6m (2008: profit 
of  1.4m).
Our shares were suspended from AIM in September 2008 
pending completion of the 2008 Report and Accounts. I am 
pleased to report that both our 2008 Annual Accounts and  
the 2008 interim Report were published in May 2009 and  
as a result the Company's Ordinary Shares were restored to 
trading on AIM on 18 May 2009.
We appreciate the support and loyalty we have received from 
Shareholders during this difficult period and hope for your 
continued loyalty. We recognise this has also been challenging 
for our suppliers and customers and we appreciate their 
continuity of business. 
Despite the extra pressures on our Directors and staff at all 
levels over the last few months, they have remained highly 
focused and professional and deserve special mention  
and thanks. 
I would also like to thank Dr Peter Felter, who stepped down 
from the Board in May, for his significant contribution to the 
Board and the Company since it was founded, and to wish  
him the best for the future. 
Throughout 2009, the oil and gas industry experienced  
a slowdown driven by weakening oil and gas prices and 
demand. As a result demand for the services provided by  
our companies generally leveled out in the second half of  
the year to 31 March 2009. 
A return to sustained oil prices of over $55 per barrel at the 
end of May 2009, from a low of approximately $40 per barrel 
in December 2008, heralded an increase in enquiries and we 
anticipate that this will result in increased fabrication contracts 
over the next months.
Our clients are oil and gas and engineering companies who 
develop new oil and gas fields including many previously 
uneconomic smaller oil and gas fields, as well as rehabilitating 
older fields and adjoining facilities. These activities require the 
fabrication and manufacturing skills and services and personnel 
that Sovereign supplies to the oil and gas industry.  Sovereign Oilfield Group Plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 8
At August 2009, the Group has fabrication facilities in the

Petroleum Services Limited (CPS ), OIL Engineering Limited 
(OIL ), Forfab Limited (Forfab ) , Labtech Services Limited 
(Labtech ), Cooltime Engineering Services Limited

Sales 
Through organic growth, albeit in a flattening market, the 
Group has experienced some growth with Group sales,  
pre disposals, for the year ended 31 March 2009 increasing  
2% to  96.5m (2008:  94.6m). 
Sovereign Fabrication Services Limited accounted for  67.9m 
(2008:  68.6m) of this turnover, pre disposals, with Sovereign 
Oilfield Services Limited accounting for  28.6m (2008: 
 26.0m) with growth mostly attributable to Prodrill. 
The Group's diverse range of customers continue to be the 
international (e.g. Total) and national (e.g. Dubai Petroleum) oil 
and gas companies, the major (e.g. Wood Group) and smaller 
oilfield engineering companies and other oilfield specialised 
service companies (e.g. FMC) to whom we supply our products 
and services over a wide geographical area and with whom 
we have good repeat business. 
The Group continued to take advantage of its fabrication supply 
chain management during the year by maximising intra-group 
co-operation. 
Review of Subsidiaries 
Sovereign Fabrication Services Limited 
Turnover across the Fabrication Division has been very similar 
to the previous year. 
This comprised: 
   CPS, turnover of  14.4m for the year (2008:  14.3m) 
   OIL, turnover of  14.1m (2008:  11.7m) 
   Forfab, turnover of  14.9m (2008:  19.2m) 
   Labtech, turnover was  9.9m (2008: 11 months,  11.8m)* 
   Vertec, turnover was  7.4m (2008: 11 months,  6.5m)**
   Cooltime, turnover was  1.3m (2008: 11 months,  1.5m) 
   SDS, turnover at  1.7m (2008:  2.6m) 
   OIL ME, turnover was  4.2m (2008: 11 months,  1.0m) 
EBITDA for the Fabrication Division for the period,  
pre disposals, was  5.1m (2008:  7.1m). 
 * Labtech's cabin rental assets were sold in March 2009.
 **  Vertec excluding its subsidiary Cooltime was sold at the end 
March 2009 in conjunction with the cabin rental assets of

Annual Report & Accounts 2009 9
EBITDA loss for the Drilling Division for the period was  2.0m 
(2008: profit of  1.6m) before exceptional items. 
DDS was sold on 5 March 2009 to Logan Oil Tools Inc for 
 250k plus up to $350k based on performance. The Board do 
not expect to receive the performance based element, although 
it is subject to audit in September 2009.
Review and Outlook 
Subsequent to negotiations with a number of potential new 
Lenders, in July 2009, Sovereign agreed revised terms with  
its current Lender group, effective for 18 May 2009, subject  
to certain conditions. 
The new terms agreed provide for a deferral of all outstanding 
defaults until 31 May 2010, a reduction in margin payable on 
both senior and mezzanine facilities and a revised covenant 
package. No restructuring or arrangement fees were payable. 
The conditions subsequent included completing the disposal  
of Vertec and the cabin rental assets of Labtech, and the Group 
announced on 11 May 2009 that it had completed the sale  
of these assets for  5.45m in cash, subject to shareholder 
approval, which was duly received. All proceeds were used  
to pay down existing debt levels.
Our Fabrication companies have shown sustained profitability 
for many years and with the disposal of our Drilling businesses, 
our focus on the Fabrication division, reduced corporate 
overhead, reduced cost of debt and oil prices over $50/barrel, 
the Board is confident of an improved trading performance in 
the current financial year.
With new funding in place and the proactive support of  
Lenders going forward, the Board has confidence that steps 
taken in 2008 and 2009 will establish a stronger platform  
for the Group's future growth and profitability.
