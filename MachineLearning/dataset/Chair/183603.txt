 Dear Shareholder,
It has been another very busy and
successful year for your Company. We
have delivered an excellent performance
in all of our key business measures
including turnover, profit, return on
capital and earnings per share and our
balance sheet remains in excellent
shape. Your Board is therefore proposing
a final dividend of 9.4 pence per share,
making a total of 14.3 pence for the year,
an increase of 16% over 2005.
Performance
Revenue increased by 23% to  254.3
million (2005:  206.5 million). Profit
before tax grew by 25% to  30.7 million
(2005:  24.5 million). Group operating
margins pre-amortisation and
exceptional items increased from 14.8%
to 15.0%. Earnings per share grew by
18% to 50.44 pence per share. Total
equity increased from  108.5 million to
 141.3 million. All of our businesses have
contributed to these excellent results.
Our Tool Hire division offers the widest
range of tools from an unrivalled national
depot network. Turnover has increased
by 17.0% to  151.0 million (2005:  129.1
million) with growth being driven from a
like for like sales increase of 9.0%.
Operating profits increased to  23.6
million (2005:  19.8 million) representing
a margin of 15.6% (2005: 15.3%). 
Our equipment businesses provide a
range of complementary lifting, power,
survey and temporary accommodation
products to a broad range of industry
sectors. In addition, during the year 
we opened our first specialist pump
operations. Turnover in the Equipment
division grew by 34% to  107.8 million
(2005:  80.7 million). Operating profit has
increased from  14.8 million to  19.8
million, giving the division an operating
margin of 18.4% (2005: 18.3%).
Our investment of  78.5 million (2005:
 60.5 million) in new hire fleet was
targeted at enhancing our reputation for
providing our clients with the widest and
best range of tools and equipment. This
has ensured that we retain our
competitive advantage of having the
youngest hire fleet in the industry with 
an average age of 2.1 years. Return on
our invested capital has remained stable
at 17.5%.
To supplement our strong organic growth,
during the financial year we acquired five
businesses for a consideration of  35
million. These businesses have all been
successfully integrated into the Speedy
Hire network. Since the conclusion of 
the financial year we completed the
acquisition of LCH, the UK's leading
independent hirer of temporary power
systems, for a total consideration of  59
million, thus giving us an increasingly
strong position in that market.
To facilitate these acquisitions, we
completed a  15 million share placing
and negotiated an enhanced  210 million
bank facility. These have given the Group
a very strong financial position to
continue with our business development
and acquisition strategy.
Strategy
Our strategy remains one of growth with
the aim to be number one or number
two in all the markets in which we
operate. This well proven strategy has
resulted in several years of consistent
growth, both organically and through
acquisitions and we see no reason why
this should not continue for the
foreseeable future. 
We will continue to open greenfield
depots wherever our research indicates
there is a profitable opportunity to
increase our geographic footprint and

2006 better serve our customers. During the
last financial year, we opened 22 such
depots across the range of our activities.
In addition, we will continue to acquire
complementary businesses which meet
our strict investment criteria. Several of
these acquisitions over the last two or
three years have, as planned, enabled 
us to move into new markets and
develop a wider customer base in
industrial services, utilities, steel, oil 
and gas, naval dockyards and
petrochemicals, as well as facilitating a
better service for our traditional
construction clients. 
To support this growth, we continue to
invest strongly in business systems,
supply chain and customer support. 
Our vision is to create One Speedy 
whereby we co-ordinate the activities 
of the entire Group to cross sell and
thereby provide a comprehensive and
unparalleled level of service for our
customers, who are at the heart of 
our business.
I would like to take this opportunity to
expand on our approach and thinking
when considering acquisitions. When we
first evaluate potential acquisitions, we
begin with a few simple common sense
questions such as Will Speedy Hire be a
good owner of this business? Does it fit
with our skill set and our market
position? Does the target business
enable Speedy Hire to sustain growth
and add value for our shareholders? 
Only when we are satisfied we have
positive answers to these questions 
do we move forward. Executive
management then prepare a detailed
business case and we only proceed
where our target internal rate of return 
is exceeded when using conservative
assumptions. Many potential acquisitions
are rejected because the infill and
expansion opportunities offered do not
adequately answer our basic questions,
do not meet our hurdle rates, or they do
not fit within our overall vision. 
It is the view of your Board that the 
hire industry will undergo significant
consolidation over the next few years.
However, research has shown that the
tool and equipment hire market is
becoming increasingly polarised
between those businesses supplying the
larger construction and industrial
companies, which have wider and more
complex needs requiring tools and
equipment for longer periods of time and
those servicing the smaller builders, DIY
enthusiasts, maintenance trades and
service industries which require
equipment in lesser volumes and for
shorter periods. Speedy Hire's current
market position is clearly biased towards
the larger, more regular hirer and our
acquisition strategy reflects this. 
People
As Speedy Hire has grown over the last
year, an additional 395 people have
joined the business and I would like to
extend a warm welcome to each of
them. We now employ over 3,400
people. I would also like to extend the
thanks of the Board and shareholders to
all our people whether in management,
operational or support functions who
provide their skill, enthusiasm and
commitment every single day to ensure
we have satisfied customers. Our
customer surveys run by external
consultants continue to produce very
high levels of satisfaction and as a result,
repeat business. 
At Board level, we are fortunate to have
an extremely able team. Mike McGrath,
having worked with us for 14 years as
our corporate lawyer, joined us in 
March as Commercial Director to work
alongside and provide valuable support
to Steve and Neil. In addition to
overseeing our continuing acquisition
programme, Mike will take responsibility
for driving forward two specific projects:
firstly the further training and
development of our people, and
secondly property requirements in terms
of the number and size of depots for the
future shape of the business. As
previously announced, Andrew Simpson
left the business at the end of the
financial year to take up a senior role
within Peel Holdings. Andrew's input
over the last three years in creating value
for shareholders has been extremely
valuable and we are greatly indebted to
him. He leaves with our best wishes for
success in the future.
Outlook
The markets in which our major
customers operate remain buoyant.
Investment in infrastructure, supported
by government spending, often through
PFI/PPP schemes and commercial and
industrial projects, all show good growth
trends. Added to this, new Health &
Safety legislation, such as the Working 
at Height and Hand Arm Vibration
directives, together with the new
legislation on noise emissions is
providing additional impetus towards
hiring, rather than owning, tools and
equipment. It is worth re-stating that one
of Speedy Hire's great strengths is the
diversity of its markets, its customers, its
range of activities and its national
spread, which brings a good balance to
the business. 
With a favourable outlook in our main
markets, ongoing investment in
strengthening and improving the
business, a strong financial position and
a first class team to execute our plans, I
look forward to reporting further progress
in the year ahead.
If you have any comments on any aspect
of this letter or indeed, any part of the
Annual Report, I would be delighted to
hear from you, either by writing to me at
Haydock, or by email at
david.wallis@speedyhire.plc.uk.
Yours sincerely,
David Wallis
