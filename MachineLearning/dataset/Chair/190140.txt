public sector. There are the additional benefits of cross selling
opportunities between the divisions and we would increasingly
expect to be able to take advantage of these opportunities in the
future.
The integration process of each of the acquisitions has been 
successful and the Group's rebranding process both internally and
externally has been completed.
In 2005 group turnover increased to  20.47m (2004:  9.88m) 
representing an increase of 107.2%. The main driver for growth in
2005 was through acquisitions in the year including SDMS
Services, Quality Care and Parys Snowdon Group Limited. The full
year effect of the prior year acquisition in Parys Snowdon Payroll
Services Limited also contributed to the growth in 2005.
I am pleased to report that the group achieved an operating profit
before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation of  0.75m
(2004:  0.08m) which includes a loss of  0.09m from discontinued
operations. The results include an operating profit contribution
before goodwill amortisation of  1.02m from the acquisitions
made during the year. Profit before tax, amortisation and 
exceptional items increased to  0.59m (2004:  0.003m) and 
adjusted earnings per share increased to 1.61p (2004: loss per
share of 0.26p).
The reported loss for the year was  0.934m (2004: 1.200m) which
equates to a loss per share for the year of 2.82p (2004: 10.35p).
Net cash outflow for the group in the year was  1.31m (2004:
 0.07m). Cash outflow from operating activities was  2.59m in the
year (2004:  0.73m) primarily due to an increase in working capital
balances following the acquisitions in the year. Financing activities
raised  6.13m in the year (2004:  3.21m), of which  5.86m came
from new share issues, net of expenses (2004:  3.68m), and net
cash outflow from acquisitions and disposals was  4.41m (2004:
 2.42m).
I am pleased to present the results for Supporta plc for the year
ended 31 March 2005.
The last year or so has been a period of significant change for
Supporta. The key changes have been:
> New Management Team
> Strategy focus on white collar outsourced services to the public 
sector
> Loss making companies in non-core activities disposed
> Formation of three operating divisions
> Key acquisitions completed in each division.
The Group aspires to be the supplier of choice within its chosen
markets. This aspiration is underpinned by the core values within
the Group founded upon first class service delivery and 
maintaining an excellent reputation based on long standing 
relationships with key public sector clients.
The Board is delighted with the ongoing support received from
investors throughout the year in relation to the Group's 
acquisitions and fund raising activities. Since the year end the
institutional shareholder base has been broadened following the
recent placing which was used to fund the acquisition of Roger 
P Dudley Limited.
Review of activities
The group structure has been reshaped from 35 companies into
three operating divisions under the ownership of Supporta plc as
shown in the diagram below.
During the year, we also sold four of the General recruitment 
businesses. The sale was in conjunction with closing the remaining
two non profitable general recruitment businesses which enables
us to focus on delivering white collar outsourced services to the
public sector.
Within this structure the new management team is more than
capable of expanding the range and scale of services offered to the

Supporta Services 
Ltd Following the acquisition of Quality Care, Sue Soame was 
appointed as Managing Director of Supporta Care Limited. Sue has
been involved in the delivery of outsourced home care services to
the public sector for over 12 years.
Supporta Care earned an operating loss before goodwill 
amortisation and exceptional items of  0.008m (2004: loss of
 0.357m). The acquisition of Quality Care contributed  0.34m of
profit, which represented just over six months of trade, towards
the divisional results of Supporta Care.
Supporta Services
This division provides a wide range of services, primarily to NHS
trusts, including Payroll Services, Systems Support, Managed
Services, Internal Audit and Consultancy. There are a number of
opportunities provided by the government initiatives to 
standardise payroll systems through electronic staff records (ESR)
and the NHS's Agenda for Change.
We believe our expertise in delivering outsourced services to the
NHS is unique and can provide further scope for growth.
The Parys Snowdon Payroll Services business has performed well in
its first full year of operation since acquisition on 14 January 2004,
and is expected to continue to contribute to the group's core
activities within Supporta Services Limited.
Two further acquisitions were integrated into the Supporta
Services business during the year. SDMS Services, a consultancy
business and Parys Snowdon Group Limited, including audit and
counter fraud services and IT systems management and 
development services primarily to the NHS and other public sector 
organisations.
Supporta Services delivered a contribution to operating profit
before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items of  1.354m
(2004:  0.250m). This includes just over 6 months of profit 
contribution of  0.56m from the acquisition of Parys Snowdon
Group and 11 months of profit contribution of  0.12m from SDMS
Services (both before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items).
Supporta Care
The acquisition of Quality Care in September 2004, a business 
providing home care services working in partnership with local
authorities in London primarily, has significantly strengthened the
Supporta Care business.
Supporta Care principally provides home care services to London
Local Authorities and provides approximately 17,500 hours of care
per week. At the point of acquisition in September 2004, Quality
Care's order book stood at  4m, which has increased to  37.6m to
date through a process of new contract awards, extensions and
renewals. The home care market remains a priority for the
Government.
We consider this area of the business to offer excellent scope for
growth due to the fragmented nature of the market. The home
care market in the UK is approximately  2 billion, and growing at
6% per annum. The private sector share of this market currently
stands at 62% but is growing at 11% per annum. In our opinion,
the quality of service is determined not only by the skills and
nature of the care workers but also by the underlying systems,
policies and procedures. We believe that our reputation in these
areas will assist our growth ambitions in our existing geographical
markets and elsewhere within the UK.
The following significant contracts for the provision of domiciliary
care have been won since the acquisition of the Quality Care 
business in September 2004:

experience of working in specialised healthcare IT business systems

Supporta Property Services
The third operating division within Supporta was established with
the acquisition of Roger P. Dudley Limited (RPD) in August 2005,
which will form the cornerstone of our new Property Services 
division. RPD is an architectural practice which services, 
predominantly, the public sector through the design, planning and
project management of property refurbishment and construction.
RPD complements the Supporta Care and Supporta Services 
divisions through being able to provide additional services to 
existing customers.

Share price
Growth in the value of the Company's share price since the start of

Board changes
Gavin Kaye left the company in December 2004 and was replaced
by Stephen Padgett as Chief Executive Officer on 1 April 2005. 
Nigel Myers joined the Board on 11 May 2005 and left on 31
August 2005 following a probationary period. 
John Williams (Non-Executive Director) retired on 1 July 2005 and
Dr. Clive Grace was appointed as Non-Executive Director on the

on 31 August 2005.
We will continue to strengthen the Board as the group develops
and we are currently in the process of selecting a suitable Finance
Director.
Employees
The Board recognises that its employees are the most important
asset within the group and aspires to be the employer of choice
within its chosen operating sectors. In doing so, the Board 
encourages investment in training and development of staff and
 Investor in People' status has already been partly achieved within
the Supporta Care division. Remuneration levels and incentive
schemes are reviewed on an ongoing basis to encourage staff
retention and excellent performance throughout the organisation.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme 
The Board is delighted that shareholders voted overwhelmingly in
favour of the adoption of a Savings Related Share Option Scheme
at the recent EGM.
We believe that employees at all levels of the Group should benefit
from being part of a larger organisation and have the chance to
participate in the ownership of the Company through such 
incentive schemes, aligning their interests with those of all 
stakeholders.
Banking facilities
Further to the reorganisation of the corporate structure, the 
financial facilities of the group were refinanced with Barclays Bank
in September 2005 to provide  2.5m of facilities as a term loan
and a revolving credit facility of up to  2.0m. I believe that the
company has a sound financial foundation from which to build.
I would finally, on behalf of the Board, like to thank all the staff
and our dedicated advisors for all their efforts during the year and
especially at this exciting time for the group. I am delighted to be
personally associated with a group of such potential.
