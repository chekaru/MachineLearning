RESULTS
We are pleased to report excellent progress by Tarsus in the year to 31 December 2003. Our ongoing businesses have
performed ahead of expectations after excluding the losses from our non-core stand-alone magazine businesses, which were
sold during the year. Net cashflow from operating activities was particularly strong.
Once again, our core exhibition and exhibition-related magazine products in the USA and UK performed well. The
French portfolio of exhibitions and directories stabilised. Our new launch programme continued apace with three
successful launches in 2003 and a further seven new events scheduled for 2004.
T urnover for the year ended 31 December 2003, including the Group's share of joint venture turnover, was  17.7 million
(2002:  19.8 million) resulting in a profit before tax, exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and loss/profit on sale of
discontinued activities of  2.1 million (2002:  1.4 million). Adjusted earnings per share were 4.0p (2002: 2.3p). After
charging  3.0 million of goodwill amortisation and  0.5 million for the loss on sale of discounted activities, the loss on
ordinary activities before tax was  1.4 million (2002: loss of  18.9 million). No exceptional items were incurred in the year
(2002:  2.9 million).
T urnover from continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 2003, including the Group's share of joint venture
turnover, was  15.5 million (2002:  15.8 million) resulting in a profit before tax, exceptional items and goodwill amorti-
sation of  2.8 million (2002:  2.5 million). Adjusted earnings per share from continuing businesses were 5.1p (2002:
4.6p). After charging  2.9 million of goodwill amortisation the loss on ordinary activities before tax from continuing
operations was  0.1 million (2002: loss of  16.4 million).
Net cash inflow from operating activities was  3.9 million (2002: outflow of  1.1 million). Net debt reduced by  3.6
million in the year to  11.7 million.
Your Directors propose to pay a final dividend of 2.2p per share. This dividend, which is unchanged from last year's
dividend, is approximately 2.3 times covered by earnings per share from the Group's continuing business. The dividend is
subject to Shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting, to be held on 28 April 2004. Subject to that approval, it
will be paid on 29 April 2004 to Shareholders on the Register of Members of the company on 19 March 2004. The
Company proposes to continue to give Shareholders the ability to elect to take this dividend in cash or as a scrip issue in
new Ordinary Shares or as a combination of the two. Your Directors intend, based on the current share price, to take scrip
in respect of 7,965,650 of their Ordinary Shares, in aggregate, representing approximately 35.2% of their total
Shareholdings and 17.8% of the issued Share Capital of the Company.
OPERATING REVIEW
Europe
T urnover for our ongoing business was  11.1 million (2002:  8.1 million) and adjusted operating profit was  1.6 million
(2002:  0.2 million), benefiting from the biennial Labelexpo Europe exhibition.
Trading results from our major European event, Labelexpo Europe, were excellent. Although volumes, (measured in net
square metres sold) for this exhibition in September were down 3% on the 2001 edition, revenues were up 4% - a
commendable performance in the context of the economic climate of the past two years. Equally important, visitor
attendance at this, our largest exhibition, was the highest in its 20-year history. Labels and Labeling International magazine
delivered a strong performance with revenues for the year up 8% on 2002.
Our seven French exhibitions - Progiforum (accounting software), SECA (call centre technology through a joint venture
with Advanstar), KM Forum (knowledge management), Educatec (education), Progilog (supply chain software), Semo
(marketing research) and MD Expo (direct marketing through a joint venture with Reed Elsevier) - delivered volumes in
line with or slightly below expectations. Encouragingly for the future, visitor attendances at all these exhibitions were good
with strong exhibitor rebookings for the 2004 editions. The French directories, which support our exhibitions, once again
delivered record results with further new products planned for 2004.

USA
T urnover was  3.8 million (2002:  7.0 million) and adjusted operating profit was  1.2 million (2002:  2.3 million) as a
result of the absence of the biennial Labelexpo Americas exhibition.
Our USA business had another very good year. V olumes at the two Las V egas Off Price Specialist Shows (discount clothing)
increased 16% compared with the equivalent exhibitions in 2002. The launch of a third Off Price Specialist show in May
2003 was well received by the industry and we intend to make this an annual event.
In addition, and as part of our strategy of growing the attendance at these exhibitions, we signed a major sponsorship and
marketing agreement with eBay, which came into effect at the beginning of 2004. The initial indications from our February
2004 show is that the eBay initiative, as part of a larger marketing campaign, has significantly grown the number of new
visitors who attended the show.
T owards the end of 2003, we decided to extend the Off Price concept into the Home Goods sector with a launch scheduled
for May 2004 in Las Vegas alongside our third Off Price Specialist show. 
Emerging Markets
During the year, we accelerated our launch programme into those large emerging markets we judge to have the best long-
term growth potential. T o this end, we launched Labelexpo into China in December 2003. The event was an unqualified
success for both exhibitors and visitors with a strong exhibitor rebooking for 2005. Additional Label launches are scheduled
for Russia, Latin America and India in 2004 with a Label event for Eastern Europe also taking place in 2004. All of our
emerging market activities in the label sector are conducted from our existing London and Milwaukee offices, thus keeping
overheads to a minimum.
In December 2003, we formed a 50:50 joint venture with Rising Star Media Group to launch the Beijing International
Travel and T ourism Market (BITTM), the only Chinese event to focus solely on the Chinese outbound travel market, an
area which we believe has strong growth potential. BITTM has been granted full endorsement by the City of Beijing and
will take place in April 2005.
Disposals
During the year, we disposed of our two stand-alone publishing businesses. In June 2003, we sold Exhibition Bulletin
magazine for a cash consideration  1.1 million of which  0.7 million was received on completion with the balance due
over the period to January 2005. The profit on disposal was  0.2 million. In December 2003, we sold our French magazine
division for  1. As a result of this transaction, 29 staff left the Company representing 42% of the total headcount of the
French office. The loss on disposal was  0.7 million.
In addition, in January 2003 we also sold our UK organic food exhibition for a cash consideration estimated to be  0.25
million of which  0.2 million has already been received.
Fund raising
In November 2003, we raised  2.0m net of expenses through the issue of 4,063,150 new Ordinary Shares of 5p each which
were allotted and issued on a non pre-emptive basis to several institutional investors at 51p per share. The proceeds of the
placing were used to provide Tarsus with additional working capital to finance the acceleration of our new launch
programme and to reduce debt.
Board
We are pleased to announce the appointment of Hugh Scrimgeour as a Non-Executive Director of T arsus. Hugh spent 17
years at P&O, and between 1993 and 1999 was Chairman and Managing Director of Earls Court and Olympia, a major
London events venue and exhibition organiser. Between 2000 and 2002, Hugh was a director of, and finally Chief
Executive Officer of Expocentric plc a leading provider of online services to the events industry. Hugh brings with him a
wealth of industry experience relevant to our business as well as valuable working knowledge of the Chinese exhibition
market. 7
After 4 years as Finance Director, Damian Delaney has left the Company and his duties will be assumed by Douglas
Emslie. Philip O'Donnell, a Non-Executive Director who has been on the Board since 1986 will be retiring at the
forthcoming AGM, as will Clive Smith, who sold his labelling exhibitions and magazine business to Tarsus in 1998. We
would like to thank Damian, Philip and Clive for their valuable contributions to the Group and wish them all well for the
future.
CURRENT TRADING AND PROSPECTS
The strong economic recovery underway in America is now having a beneficial effect on our business with customers more
willing to increase expenditure through exhibitions both in industrialised countries and emerging markets.
As before, results for 2004 will be weighted towards the second half of the year. We anticipate good like-for-like volume
growth in 2004 from our existing portfolio, supplemented by a growing stream of revenues from our aggressive launch
programme. Whilst continuing to grow our existing business in established markets, we will be endeavouring over the next
3 years to increase significantly the proportion of the Group's business that is derived from China, India, Russia and South
America. It should be noted that a very large proportion of our revenues for 2004 will be denominated in US dollars, a
currency which has weakened considerably against Sterling in recent months. It is the policy of the Board not to hedge
translation differences.
