 CHAIRMAN'S AND MANAGING DIRECTOR'S  STATEMENT
OVERVIEW
2010 was a challenging period. The Group started the year
facing an economic backdrop which was far from clear
and with real fears of a double dip recession in both
Europe and the US. This economic uncertainty
characterised trading in the early part of the year with
both exhibitors and visitors reluctant to make early
commitments to events. As the year progressed and
exhibitors became more confident, visibility started to
improve and 2010 ended on a more optimistic note.
In light of such an uncertain backdrop the Group's results
are a reflection of both the quality and diversity of the
portfolio. Our geographic coverage provides access to
some of the faster growing regions of the world in both the
Middle and Far East and this was reflected by very strong
performances in both regions. We also experienced good
growth from the recovery of the US economy with both Off-
Price (discount clothing) and Medical showing improving
trends. Looking to the future, our strategy to grow our
exposure to the faster growing economies of the Middle
and Far East through Project 50/13 is gathering pace. The
expansion of events through organic growth is particularly
evident in Medical, Aerospace and Off-Price where the
Group has been successful in broadening the appeal of the
shows through product enhancements.
Underlying organic revenue growth of 6% on a
comparable basis was achieved through a mixture of
volume (+4%) and price (+2%) highlighting the importance
of brand leader events in difficult times.
2011 will see the underlying strength of exhibitions as a
medium for marketing spend improve as customers
increasingly value face-to-face contact.
After a period where price expectations were too high and
discouraged M + A, activity levels are starting to pick up
as prices and growth prospects have come more into line.
The Group will continue to evaluate selective
opportunities in the right sectors and geographies.
FINANCIAL RESULTS
Group revenues were  43.6m (2009:  57.5); profit before
tax after exceptional items was  5.3m (2009:  6.8m); and
adjusted profit before tax was  9.5m (2009:  14.6m).
Like-for-like revenue growth, excluding currency
movements, increased by 6%. Basic earnings per share
were 5.4p (2009: 6.3p) and adjusted earnings per share
were 10.4p (2009: 17.4p).
The Group incurred exceptional one-off costs in 2010
resulting from the transaction costs of the acquisition of
the 20% of MCII (medical division) acquired during the
year and historic bank fees. As a result of a change in
accounting rules, transaction fees are now written off to
the income statement during the year. The historic bank
fees were written off as a result of an early bank
refinancing. These costs, amounting to  0.8m, have been
excluded from adjusted profits.
The Directors are proposing a final dividend of 4p per
share, bringing the total for the year to 6p per share
(2009: 6p per share). The final dividend, which is subject
to Shareholder approval, is proposed to be paid on 6 July
2011 to Shareholders on the Register of Members of the
Company on 27 May 2011. A scrip dividend will continue
to be offered as an alternative.
DEBT
Management has continued its focus on cash generation,
tight cost control and making selective investments in the
portfolio to generate longer term growth, whilst ensuring
that debt is reduced.
During the year the Group generated  11.0m (2009:
 10.1m) of cash from continuing operations. Net debt at
31 December 2010 was  28.6m, a reduction of  2.1m or
7% against 31 December 2009 - better than
expectations.
OPERATING REVIEW
Geographical analysis  
A summary of the performance of each of our divisions
during the period is as follows:
USA - good outcome with strong performances from Off-
Price and Medical.
Europe - trading conditions in the French division
remained challenging, however Q4 events showed signs
of improved trading.
Chairman's and Managing 
Director's statement
TARSUS GROUP plc 2 TARSUS GROUP plc
Emerging markets - MEBA in Dubai and Labelexpo India
performed strongly. A new Label event was launched in
South China.
USA
Off-Price continued to make good progress and is now of
a record size. Having seen a decline in sales in February
2009, every event since then has seen good growth. Our
latest event in February 2011 was the largest to date. The
broadening of the offer to retailers by the inclusion of
footwear and accessories has been a major factor in this
division's success.
Medical continued to deliver excellent growth, both in the
number of events and attendees. Much of the growth can
be traced to the increasing demand for education from
doctors and the fact that pursuing a healthy lifestyle is
becoming a mainstream concern. We launched our
educational programmes online in the second half of the
year and these have been well received by the market. 
Labelexpo Americas in September was the most
successful exhibition for our customers in the last ten
years. Whilst spend by exhibitors was some 7% lower than
the previous edition, the number of companies taking
space remained constant and visitor numbers were up
5%. Strong customer sales generated at the event
resulted in a very encouraging re-book rate of 83%,
providing Tarsus with a high level of visibility for the next
edition in 2012.
Europe
Our French trading remained challenging for much of the
year with the economic backdrop depressing sales.
However, as the year progressed, the actions of
management to reduce costs, improve the offering and
innovate produced some encouraging signs.
The French division's revenues reduced by 5% compared
with 2009 - a very creditable performance and ahead of its
local peers.
The French portfolio continues to show signs of
improvement and we were pleased to finish the year with
Educatec (education), and start 2011 with Mod'amont
(fashion accessories), as both exhibitions grew in size.
Emerging Markets
The two key events in the region in 2010 were MEBA, the
business aviation exhibition in Dubai, and Labelexpo India in
New Delhi.
MEBA took place in December and produced results well
ahead of its previous edition - revenues were up 40%, with
visitors up 13%. MEBA, in just 5 years, has become the third
largest business aviation event in the world.  In addition to
becoming a key sales platform for business aircraft
manufacturers, service providers and suppliers to the
Industry, MEBA is now an important venue for signing
major industry agreements. H.H Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed
Al Maktoum, Chairman of Emirates, opened this year's
show by signing an agreement to build a new business
aviation terminal at the Al Maktoum International Airport in
Dubai. 
Labelexpo India took place in early December. Revenues
and visitors were up 22% and 27% respectively from its
previous edition. The event saw a major increase in
international exhibitors who made excellent sales at the
event.  As a result, the rebooking for the 2012 edition has
been exceptionally strong.

TARSUS GROUP plc
Labelexpo South China, an event launched in Guangzhou in
October, was profitable at its first edition and complements
Labelexpo Asia which takes place in Shanghai in 2011. 
OUTLOOK
The improving trends witnessed in Q4 2010 look set to run
into 2011 as the global economy continues its recovery.
Within each two-year cycle, odd years are by far the larger in
profit terms for the Group as they contain both Labelexpo
Europe (in September) and the Dubai Airshow (in November).
Bookings for both these biennial events remain strong.
  For Labelexpo, space sales are tracking ahead of the 2009
edition.
  The Dubai Airshow sales pipeline is strong and, with the
venue configuration confirmed for 2011, we remain
confident of a good performance from this event.
There were two significant events in the first quarter of 2011
- the Off-Price Show in Las Vegas and the Mod'amont fashion
accessories exhibition in Paris. Off-Price has continued its
recent trends and was a record show. Mod'amont was well
received by our customers with a good increase in visitors.
The improving economic environment is impacting
positively on our portfolio of events in the US and the
emerging markets. France has traditionally benefited later
in the economic cycle and the second half weighting of our
portfolio in 2011 should be helpful. Encouragingly, forward
bookings for 2011 remain strong, standing at 63% of
anticipated full year revenues compared with 58% for 2010
(as adjusted for biennial events).
We remain committed to our long term strategy of
increasing our exposure to emerging markets (Project
50/13) and driving organic growth within the business.
