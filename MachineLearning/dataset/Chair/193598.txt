 BUSINESS REVIEW
STRATEGIC OVERVIEW
2012 proved to be a major milestone for Tarsus, with the
Group achieving its Project 50/13 target of deriving 50% of
revenues from Emerging Markets by 2013 ahead of
schedule. As a result, at the start of 2013 the Group
launched its Quickening the Pace  strategy. 
Project 50/13 saw the organic development and
acquisition of market leading products in the Emerging
Markets and the US as well as the reduction in the Group's
exposure to continental Europe.  As part of 50/13, during
the year the Group acquired interests in leading exhibition
businesses in Turkey (Life Media and CYF) and China (GZ
Auto).
The Group is now moving into the next phase of its growth
strategy. The core focus of Quickening the Pace  will be
to accelerate earnings per share growth. This will be
driven by a combination of the geographical replication of
our major brands into fast growth economies; organic
growth from the existing portfolio; tight cost control; and
selective bolt-on acquisitions in the US and Emerging
Markets.
Quickening the Pace  will leverage fundamental changes
underway in the world's economies, with growth in the US
and selective Emerging Markets poised to further outpace
the mature economies of the West. The exhibition
markets in which Tarsus operates are now consolidating
rapidly to the benefit of the companies that achieve early
entry. 
The Group is already delivering on its new strategic
objectives, with the announcement in January 2013 that
T arsus has agreed to acquire 51% of Indonesian exhibition
organiser PT Infrastructure Asia. The acquisition, which
completed on 28 February 2013, will provide Tarsus with
an important hub in the fast growing Indonesian exhibition
market. 
The Group intends to replicate its leading brands interna-
tionally, with editions of GZ Auto being launched into
Indonesia and Turkey. Zuchex will also be launched into
Kazakhstan.
FINANCIAL RESULTS
Group revenues for the full year were strong at  51.5m
(2011:  61.7m) and up 18% on a biennial basis (2010:
 43.6m).  Like-for-like revenue growth, excluding
foreign exchange movements, increased by 13%.
Group adjusted profit before tax was  14.8m (2011:
 16.8m) and up 56% on a biennial basis (2010:  9.5m).
Net interest expense decreased to  1.2m (2011:  1.6m)
reflecting our lower debt levels across 2012 together
with the benefit of lower interest rates under the new
banking facilities. Reported profit before tax was  8.4m
(2011:  3.0m).
The Group incurred a number of one-off costs relating
to acquisitions and the bank refinancing completed in
August 2012. These costs, amounting to  2.2m, have
been excluded from adjusted profits.
The adjusted tax charge of  2.2m (2011:  2.5m)
represents 15% (2011: 15%) of the Group's adjusted
profits before tax. The reported tax charge is  1.8m
(2011:  2.1m). The Group continues to focus on tax
efficiency and generates nearly all of its profits outside
of the UK, including markets with significantly lower tax
rates.
Adjusted earnings per share were 12.2p (2011: 17.0p).
On a biennial basis adjusted earnings per share were up
from 10.4p in 2010.  Basic earnings per share for 2012
were 5.6p (2011: 0.3p).
The Group generated  12.2m (2011:  11.8m) of cash
from operations, an increase of 11% against 2010, the
biennial comparative year (2010:  11.0m). 
Acquisition costs during the year were partially offset by
both a strong operational cash generation and the
proceeds of a placing. The Group's net debt at 31
December 2012 was  15.7m (2011:  13.7m). 
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 4.6p per
share, bringing the total for the year to 6.8p per share
(2011: 6.3p per share), up 8%.

Director's statement

The final dividend, subject to shareholder approval, will
be paid on 10 July 2013 to Shareholders on the Register
of Members on 31 May 2013. A scrip dividend will
continue to be offered as an alternative.
OPERATING REVIEW
Acquisitions 
In 2012, Tarsus made three key acquisitions as part of
its Project 50/13 strategy to derive 50% of revenues
from Emerging Markets by 2013.
30 March 2012: acquired 70% of LifeMedia Fuarcilik A.  .
(Life Media), one of the largest independent exhibition
businesses in Turkey, for an estimated total consid-
eration of  18m. The Life Media acquisition was part
funded by the successful placing of 8,086,228 new
ordinary shares of 5 pence each at a placing price of
135.0p per share which raised approximately  10.6m
net of expenses.
6 November 2012: acquired, through its subsidiary IFO,
70% of CYF Fuarc l k A.  . (CYF), for an estimated total
consideration of  3m. 
These acquisitions were a key component in the
realisation of the Project 50/13 strategy with Turkey
representing an important market for the Group as it
rapidly transitions toward becoming a commercial hub
for the Balkans, Central Asia, the Middle East and
Europe. Both businesses have now been fully integrated
into the Group.
17 December 2012: completed the acquisition of 50% of
the China International Automotive Aftermarket
Industry and Tuning (Guangzhou) Trade Fair (GZ Auto)
and other associated business assets for an estimated
total consideration of  11m. 
The acquisition of GZ Auto provides Tarsus with
exposure to the rapidly growing automotive industry in
China. The first GZ Auto event held under T arsus
ownership was in February 2013 and was a record event
with revenues up 23%.
Emerging Markets 
Turkey
IFO held REW (the Recycling, Environment Technologies
and Waste Management International Fair) in June
2012, the second edition of the event under Tarsus's
ownership, achieving revenue growth of 19%.
The first Life Media exhibition held under Tarsus
ownership, Ideal Home, was held in April 2012 and
performed strongly, with revenues up 50% on the 2011
edition. Zuchex, Life Media's largest housewares event,
was held in September and produced an excellent
performance with revenues increasing 16% over the
previous iteration.

GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS
3 BUSINESS REVIEW
TARSUS GROUP plc
CYF held its first event under Tarsus's ownership,
Eurasia Plant Fair, in December and increased
revenues by 36%.
Dubai
The Group's events in Dubai grew well with a notable
performance from GESS (education) with revenues 
up 15%.
MEBA (Middle East Business Aviation), the biennial
business jet exhibition, was held in December 2012 at
the new Al Maktoum International Airport at Dubai
World Central, which will host the 2013 Dubai Air Show.
MEBA achieved record results with revenues increasing
21% and visitors up 22% over the previous edition.
China
Hope, the Group's Chinese joint venture, exceeded
expectations in 2012 with revenues up 37%. This
growth was driven primarily by the strong performance
of the medical equipment portfolio in Central China.
The South China Label Show took place in December
2012 in Guangzhou, achieving critical mass with
revenues up 51% on its previous edition. 
India
Labelexpo India was held in October 2012 with
revenues well up on its previous 2010 edition, as
demand for labels is driven higher by rising personal
consumption in emerging economies.
US
Labelexpo America took place in September 2012 in
Chicago and performed very well, with revenues up 14%
on the previous 2010 event. 
The February 2012 and August 2012 Off-Price shows in
Las Vegas performed well, with revenues up 7% and 3%
respectively.
The Medical division continued its excellent growth,
ahead of the Board's expectations, with revenues
increasing by 20%. This was driven by our education

online programmes were launched two years ago and
their revenues have now overtaken those from the
physical programmes. This includes a growing
proportion of international sales primarily from the
Middle East and Asia. The May 2012 and December 2012
events both achieved record results.
Europe
Trading in the Group's French business ended the year in
line with Board expectations. The events and education
exhibitions performed better than their 2011 editions
and a number of smaller new exhibitions were
successfully launched during the year partially offsetting
a weaker performance from this division's IT events
where trading conditions remained challenging. The
results for prior years include the revenues of
Modamont, which was disposed of in December 2011.
OUTLOOK
Following the completion of Project 50/13, Tarsus
expects more than 50% of Group revenue in 2013 to be
generated from Emerging Markets. The Group is
seeing strong bookings in Turkey, China and from its
largest biennial events - the Dubai Airshow and
Labelexpo Europe. Good growth is also expected from
the Group's US portfolio, which features the Off-Price
and Medical brands.
Owing to the incidence of the large biennial events within
the portfolio, profits generated in odd years are typically
larger than those generated in even years.
The GZ Auto event was held in February 2013 and was a
record edition with revenues up 23%. Tarsus intends to
replicate this event in Istanbul and Indonesia in 2014 as
well as domestically in the current year .
The move to a new venue for the 2013 Dubai Airshow has
facilitated a broadening of the Group's offering for that
show. Tarsus continues to invest to drive strong organic
growth from the show that serves the world's fastest
growing aerospace region. Sales for the 2013 exhibition
are currently substantially ahead of the previous edition.
Off-Price was held in Las Vegas in February 2013 with
revenues up 6% on the previous edition.
The French business is tracking in line with the Board's
expectations although the Group remains vigilant given
the current macroeconomic uncertainty in Europe. 
Forward bookings for 2013, on a like-for-like basis, are
currently 16% ahead of those for 2012 (as adjusted for
biennials and acquisitions). 
Tarsus remains confident that momentum will
accelerate in 2013 with the implementation of its
Quickening the Pace  strategy, focusing on brand
replication, organic growth, cost control and carefully
targeted acquisitions.
