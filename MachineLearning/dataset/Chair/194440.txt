NORMAN ASKEW, CHAIRMAN
Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2003 3 4 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2003 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2003 5
In North America, we continue to enjoy very strong
demand for our product and are well positioned to grow 
in 2004.
The company remains well placed to take advantage of
our opportunities and face all challenges that lie ahead.
Housing is the key driver of growth, accounting for over 
95 per cent of operating profit. However our skills in
property, development, and construction position us
uniquely amongst our peer group. T aylor Woodrow is 
able to offer, from within our own operation, the wide
portfolio of expertise so important in today' s complex
development environment. 
Developing our future means: continuing to invest in 
our land bank; the excellence of our design and product
range; anticipating future trends and the needs and
requirements of our customers; nurturing the
entrepreneurial spirit of our people who will shape our
business in the future.

T ogether with the interim dividend of 2.4 pence paid on 
3 November this makes a total dividend for the year of 8.9

dividend will be paid on 1 July 2004 to shareholders 
on the register at close of business on 28 May 2004.
This dividend will be paid as a conventional cash dividend
but shareholders are once again being offered the
alternative to reinvest some or all of their dividend under
the Dividend Re-investment Plan, details of which are
contained in a separate circular to shareholders.

Board changes
On 29 July 2003, I was appointed to the Board as 
non-executive Chairman. I am delighted to have joined
Taylor Woodrow . 
Following the successful acquisition of Wilson 
Connolly, on 6 October 2003, Graeme McCallum,
previously Chief Executive of Wilson Connolly, was
appointed to the Board as an Operations Director.
Graeme brings to the Board significant experience of the
UK house building market having worked in the industry
for over 25 years. 
Michael Davies joined the Board as a non-executive
director on 13 October 2003. Michael has a strong
background in the building supplies industry and is the
Chairman of Baxi Group Limited and an active member of
the Construction Products Association.
Vernon Sankey joined the Board as a non-executive
director on 1 January 2004. Vernon is currently a non-
executive director of Pearson plc and of Zurich Financial
Services AG (Swiss). He is Deputy Chairman of Photo-Me
International plc. Vernon has considerable experience of
leadership, global change management and personal
development matters.
As we had previously announced, Dr Robert Hawley
retired from the Board on 29 May 2003. After three and 
a half years' service as a non-executive director, Norman
Broadhurst decided to step down from the Board on 
30 November 2003. I express the Board' s appreciation to
them for their contribution to the business. 
Andrew Dougal has succeeded Norman as chairman of
the audit committee. 
After eleven years' service as a non-executive director 
Sir George Russell will be stepping down from the 
Board on 19 April 2004. He has made a significant
contribution to T aylor Woodrow and he leaves with our
very best wishes for the future.
Our people
Our excellent results, together with the successful
acquisition of Wilson Connolly, would not have been
possible without the energy, commitment and
professionalism of our people. Thank you to my Board
colleagues, our management and all our teams for a job
well done in 2003. 
I extend a warm welcome to our new colleagues who
have joined us from Wilson Connolly and recognise the
good work that they are already undertaking.
Thanks are also due to our customers, trading partners,
shareholders and the other stakeholders in our business
for the continuing support that they give T aylor Woodrow.
Looking ahead
With the acquisition of Wilson Connolly, 2004 will be 
an exciting year as we see the full year benefits of the
integration accruing. The UK housing market remains
attractive, supported by a surplus of demand for new
houses and low interest rates. 
Chairman' s Statement

Chief Executive' s Review
Our business strategy is to create sustainable
shareholder value by growing, both organically
and by acquisition, as a developer of living and
working environments.  
2003 was another successful and busy year
for T aylor Woodrow. A year of change but also
of delivery.  
IAIN NAPIER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE
As previously forecast, we realised the  21 million of cost
savings from the realignment and simplification of our 
UK business. We reduced 19 separate offices into one
integrated network of 1 1 regions today incorporating a
central office in Solihull, West Midlands. 
We acquired Wilson Connolly in early October for 
 499 million. The fit between the two businesses has
proved to be excellent. Wilson Connolly gives us stronger
presence in areas where our regional business was less
developed. For example, Wilson Connolly business was
strong in the North West, an area where we had been
working to get our regional business up to scale.
Importantly , Wilson Connolly , like T aylor Woodrow was not
over represented in the London and South East markets
which have not recently been as attractive as other
regional markets.
The integration of Wilson Connolly is proceeding well 
and we remain confident of securing  12.5 million of
synergies in 2004, rising to  25 million in 2005.
