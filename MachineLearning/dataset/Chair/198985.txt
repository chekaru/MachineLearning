CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW
Dear shareholder,
2009 was another challenging year for Tomkins. The
severe financial crisis in the first half of the year caused
extended plant shutdowns and extensive destocking
in most of the Group's markets. Industrial markets
declined significantly, particularly the OE markets. The
US automotive aftermarket continued to demonstrate its
resilience, with demand supported by lower gasoline
prices and increasing miles driven. The automotive OE
market was down 13% globally in 2009, with North
American production down 32%. US non-residential
construction declined by 46% on a square footage basis
and 33% on a value basis. The US residential construction
market declined for the fourth consecutive year and
now stands 73% below the peak in 2005, as measured
by housing starts. This market declined by 39% in 2009
alone, to reach 554,000 housing starts. However, the
second half of the year saw stabilisation across some
of our markets, with a recovery in volumes in the
automotive OE markets, strong growth in our emerging
markets and stabilisation in the industrial replacement
and residential construction markets.
Weak economic fundamentals, such as low levels of
consumer and business confidence, combined with lack
of credit and availability of cash, still continue to constrain
demand. Any recovery is expected to be slow, particularly
in Europe. Emerging economies, such as China, India and
Brazil, are expected to remain strong, and to continue to
grow by high single digit percentages.
During the year, we implemented and substantially
completed our restructuring initiatives, which include
Project Eagle and Project Cheetah. As well as reducing
our capacities in developed regions, these initiatives
were aimed at expanding our footprint in higher growth
regions and, as such, we have completed new facilities in
China and India in 2009 and will open a new facility in
Turkey in 2010.
Results
Sales were $4,180.1 million in 2009 (2008: $5,515.9 million),
a decline of 24.2%. Most of the Group's end markets
weakened significantly, particularly in the first half of the
year, which caused a corresponding decline in sales
volumes across the Group.
Adjusted operating profit was $249.8 million in 2009
(2008: $402.9 million), down 38.0% largely due to the
effect of reduced sales volumes.
The Group's adjusted operating margin was 6.0% in
2009 compared with 7.3% in 2008.
Cash generated from operations was $532.1 million
(2008: $628.7 million). Trading cash flow decreased by
$20.8 million to $422.0 million (2008: $442.8 million).
Net debt was reduced in the year by $268.9 million to
$207.5 million.
In 2009, the Group incurred a diluted loss per share
on continuing operations of 1.33 cents (2008: loss of
7.34 cents). Adjusted diluted earnings per share were
14.81 cents (2008: 25.96 cents).
Dividend
The Board proposes a final dividend for 2009 of 6.50 cents
per share, making a total dividend for the year of 10.00
cents per share. Looking forward, the Board will seek to
resume its progressive dividend policy as soon as results
and market conditions allow.
Subject to approval by shareholders at the AGM on
1 June 2010, the final dividend will be paid on 10 June 2010
to shareholders on the register as at the close of business
on 7 May 2010.
Highlights 2009
The Group made good progress against its key priorities:
- Substantially completed its restructuring initiatives,
Projects Eagle and Cheetah.
- Completed the acquisition of Hydrolink within the
Gates Engineering & Services business.
- Reduced working capital by over $240 million.
- Completed a forward-start committed bank facility,
extending the maturity of our bank facilities to 2012.
- Maintained a strong balance sheet, supported by
good working capital management and reductions
in capital expenditure.

Chairman's Statement and
Chief Executive's Review
Overview
Strategy
Our growth strategy is focused on three key initiatives
which we execute both organically and through bolt-on
acquisitions: (i) leveraging the global Gates brand and
footprint by growing our service and distribution
capabilities in the global industrial and automotive
aftermarket end markets; (ii) expanding our presence in
higher-growth emerging markets; and (iii) developing
energy-efficient,  green' products which reduce
emissions. A summary of our strategic priorities and
progress is set out on page 3.
Corporate Social Responsibility
CSR remains an integral part of our everyday business
practices and one of the drivers of our success. Corporate
governance at Tomkins is recognised to be amongst the
best in class. We continue to address the demands of the
challenging regulatory environment and place a strong
emphasis on corporate governance in all our activities.
The health and safety of our employees and those people
and communities who are affected by our operations is of
utmost importance to us. Our health and wellness
programme entered its second year, aimed at improving the
wellness level of the employees, increasing productivity and
promoting loyalty and collaboration worldwide. We
completed the roll out of our supplier charter, which is now
incorporated into the terms of all our companies' purchase
orders. Looking forward, we will continue to implement our
CSR strategy, focusing in 2010 on our key priorities of:
  Further improving our safety performance
  Wellness of employees
  Understanding and managing our environmental
and climate change impacts
  Recruiting and retaining talented people
Outlook
Although a number of our end markets appear to have
stabilised, there remains uncertainty about the strength
and timing of any recovery. We expect any recovery to be
towards the latter part of 2010. We set out below our
current expectations for our end markets for 2010
compared to 2009. The share of Group sales shown is
based on sales of ongoing segments in 2009.
Industrial (28.3% of Group sales)
  North America (17.7% of Group sales)
North American industrial OE markets are expected
to grow gradually by low to mid-single digit
percentages, benefiting from the ending of
destocking and recovery of economic activity. North
American industrial replacement markets are
expected to grow by mid-single digit percentages.
  Europe (4.7% of Group sales)
Industrial activity in Europe is expected to
demonstrate a similar trend to North America.
  Rest of the world (5.9% of Group sales)
Industrial activity across the remainder of our
geographic markets is expected to grow by double-
digit percentages.
Automotive aftermarket (22.9% of Group sales)
The automotive aftermarket in North America and
Europe is expected to be broadly flat in 2010. In Asia,
the aftermarket is expected to grow by high single
digit percentages.
Automotive OE (22.6% of Group sales)
  Global
The global automotive OE market is expected to
grow by around 10%, to around 60.0 million units.
  North America (8.8% of Group sales)
North American automotive OE production is
expected to grow from 8.6 million units to around
10.0 million units in 2010.
  Europe (5.5% of Group sales)
European automotive OE production is expected to
remain flat at around 16.5 million units in 2010.
  Rest of the world (8.3% of Group sales)
The Group's other major geographic markets
comprising China, India and Brazil, are expected to
grow from 16.3 million units to around 18.5 million
units in 2010.
Non-residential construction (16.5% of Group sales)
  US non-residential construction is expected to decline
by around 10-15% on both a square foot basis and
a value basis.
Residential construction (8.0% of Group sales)
  US residential construction is expected to improve,
with housing starts expected to reach around
625,000 units in 2010. In the first half of 2010,
housing starts are expected to be broadly flat
compared with the second half of 2009, with
an improvement in the second half of the year.
Other markets include manufactured housing and
recreational vehicles and in total account for 1.7% of
Group sales.
We believe that the actions of our managers in executing
our restructuring plans have positioned the Group well to
take advantage of any recovery in our end markets.
Customers, investors and employees
On behalf of the Board, we would like to thank all of our
customers, suppliers, business partners and investors for
their continued support, especially under these difficult
market conditions. We look forward to continuing these
strong relationships over the forthcoming year.
The continued commitment and dedication of our
employees enables us to achieve our objectives and we
would like to thank them for their hard work and
commitment during the past year.
David Newlands James Nicol
Chairman Chief Executive
The stabilisation in some of our end markets enabled
the Group to achieve higher sales, adjusted operating
profit and cash flow in the second half of 2009
compared with the first half of 2009. Our focus on
working capital management, combined with our cost
reduction and restructuring initiatives drove a trading
cash flow of $422.0 million and enabled a reduction in
net debt to $207.5 million at the end of the year.
