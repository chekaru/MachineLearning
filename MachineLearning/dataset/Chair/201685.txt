Results
The Group has enjoyed another good year 
in 2011 with strong growth in both sales 
and profits, with operating profit up by 40% 
to  6.9m. Group revenue continued to grow 
for the thirteenth year in succession with an 
increase for the year of 18% to  74.5m (2010: 
 63.3m). Group earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation and amortisation increased 
by 33% to  8.0m (2010: adjusted*  6.0m); 
operating profits increased by 40% to  6.9m 
(2010: adjusted*  4.9m) with profit before tax 
for the year being up by 42% to a new all-time 
high of  6.4m (2010: adjusted * 4.5m). Basic 
earnings per share has increased by 40% to 
42.5 pence (2010: adjusted* 30.3 pence) per 
share.
Over the last four years Group revenue has 
risen by 96% and profits before tax by 125%. 
This is a reflection of many years of hard 
work by management and staff in building a 
business that has been able to prosper in a 
period of economic and financial uncertainty.
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 
9.7 pence (2010: 8.9 pence), increasing the 
total dividend for the year by 11.5% to 14.5 
pence (2010: 13.0 pence) per share. The final 
dividend will be payable on 2 March 2012 to 
all shareholders on the register at close of 
business on 27 January 2012.
As reported at the half year, the Group had 
an exceptionally strong first six months and, 
as expected, the second half of the year 
continued at a steadier pace with some 
noticeable weakness in the final quarter. A 
combination of new business wins, continuing 
growth in the Americas and the well 
documented increase in global raw material 
prices has resulted in a significant increase 
in both revenues and profits for the Group 
during the year. The cash flows for the year 
were also good, with overall net debt reducing 
by  3.0m to  8.0m, with Group net short term 
borrowings of only  0.2m.
The growth over the last year has largely 
been driven by a very strong performance by 
Treatt USA, which principally serves the North 
American market, together with a marked turn 
around in the fortunes of Earthoil, the Group's 
cosmetics ingredients business which 
specialises in organic and fair trade certified 
products. This has been underpinned by R.C. 
Treatt, the UK operating company, which has 
continued its steady performance of the last 
few years although, due to a weak Q4, its 
profits were down on the prior year. 
During the year, the Group's most significant 
raw material, orange oil (an orange juice by-
product), rose from the $2/kg level it had 
been at in recent years, to almost $11/kg, 
before falling back to the $6-$7/kg range. As 
a result of this, the value of sales of orange oil 
products, which represented 24% of Group 
revenue (2010: 17%), increased by more than 
70% during the year although volumes fell 
by more than 20% as a consequence of 
the Group's conservative risk management 
policies during this period of exceptionally high 
prices. For most of the year, the US Dollar to 
Pound Sterling exchange rate had a broadly 
neutral effect on the business, but in the two 
weeks prior to year end there was a sudden 
strengthening of the US Dollar, which resulted 
in a foreign exchange loss of  0.3k on R.C. 
Treatt's Dollar-denominated debt. 
 
Over the last few years, R.C. Treatt has 
performed consistently well and whilst 2011 
has proved to be a more difficult year, revenues 
still grew by 4% to  45.3m (2010:  43.6m). 
The Company began the financial year with 
a healthy order book, and this, together with 
the strong orange oil price, resulted in nine 
months of good profitability, but the final 
quarter of the year was a disappointment, 
with sales slowing and margins coming 
under significant pressure. The Company has 
benefitted, over the last few years, from its 
wide geographic spread, exporting to about 
90 countries, which has enabled it to maintain 
a steady performance through turbulent 
times. Both Europe and Latin America were 
areas of good growth for the Company, with 
sales to Germany growing by 24%. 
For Treatt USA, 2011 was a year of impressive 
growth. Although it did enjoy some benefits 
from the spike in orange oil prices, the 
underlying performance of the business was 
at a new level to that seen in previous years. 
Year on year US Dollar sales grew by 49% 
although gross margins did fall during the 
course of the year. As well as a sharp increase 
in the level of orange oil sales, the growth in 
specialty sales continued with another year of 
double digit growth, increasing in US Dollars 
by 14% (2010: 15%) across a wide range of 
products, and with total overheads remaining 
unchanged from the previous year, profits 
more than doubled compared to 2010.
Following a few years of difficult trading, 2011 
has been a good year for Earthoil as it turned 
into profit. Year on year sales for Earthoil 
grew by 64%. This did, however, include a 
substantial shipment which had been delayed 
from the previous year. On a like for like basis 
sales grew by an encouraging 23%. This 
growth was achieved without any increase in 
overheads and this, together with the absence 
of the loss-making South African subsidiary 
which was disposed of last year, resulted in a 
net improvement to the Group of  0.6m. 08 TREATT PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011

Prospects
The Group has seen significant weakness 
in R.C. Treatt's order book over the last few 
months and there is a return to the short 
term de-stocking practices of two years ago 
which has been increased by the impact of 
the current global economic climate. This, 
coupled with falling raw material prices, does 
mean that the outlook for 2012 is uncertain. 
Over the next few months, orange oil prices 
are expected to fall but the extent of the 
likely fall is unclear. However, the Group has 
many years' experience of managing its risk 
in periods of price volatility and so, whilst 
some stock losses are inevitable, this will 
relate mainly to  pipeline' inventory and will be 
controllable.
The year ended 30 September 2011 was 
characterised by the significant improvements 
in Earthoil and Treatt USA and these should 
be consolidated upon over the next twelve 
months. At R.C. Treatt, however, the final 
quarter of last year saw a slow-down in 
activity which has continued into this financial 
year, where the impact of de-stocking has 
led to falling raw material prices, lower levels 
of sales and reduced margins. We do not 
now anticipate orders picking up much until 
mid-2012, especially for R.C. Treatt whose 
customers operate in many of the territories 
which are currently experiencing significant 
economic weakness. Consequently, the 
Board believe that pre-tax profits for the year 
ended 30 September 2012 will be significantly 
lower than was previously thought.
Summary
In summary, the Group has performed well 
over its entire product range over the last four 
years through difficult times, but the view for 
the current year ended 30 September 2012 
is it will be one of the more challenging years 
in recent times with profits coming under 
pressure. However, the world continues to 
eat, drink and buy quality cosmetics, and 
overall demand continues to grow in spite of 
economic conditions. Flavour, fragrance and 
cosmetics companies look to Treatt to provide 
quality products in an efficient manner. As a 
truly independent and global business, Treatt 
remains well placed to take advantage of 
competitive opportunities, and through its 
commitment to continuous improvement, 
Treatt has become a supplier of choice to 
many large global businesses as well as 
national companies. 
People
Most importantly, the Board recognise that 
these results would not have been achieved 
without the hard work and dedication of 
colleagues across four continents and would 
like to place on record its thanks to them.
Finally, following three years as a Non-
executive Director and Chairman of Treatt 
plc, I feel the time is right to hand over the 
reins, and, as previously announced, I shall be 
standing down at the AGM. It has been an 
enormous privilege to have been on the Board 
during a period of significant growth for the 
Group and I wish all at Treatt the very best for 
the future.
