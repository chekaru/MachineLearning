31 mARch 2011
We are pleased to report a very strong performance with 
encouraging progress Group wide. revenue, operating profit margin
*
 
and earnings per share have all shown significant uplift on 2010.
revenue grew by 45%, operating profit margin
*
 increased by 95% 
and adjusted earnings per share was up 3.2 times to 2.57p.
at the same time we have remained focused on strengthening the 
balance sheet. cash and cash equivalents were  1.612m at the year 
end and net debt has been reduced by 93% from  0.841 at 31 March 
2010 to  0.061m at 31 March 2011
Based on the progress we have made and our confidence in future 
prospects, the Board is recommending the payment of a maiden 
dividend of 0.1p per share as part of a longer term progressive 
dividend policy.
OpERATiOnAl REviEw The Group operates four main business segments which are 
focused on the energy, transportation, aerospace and utilities 
sectors. The businesses serve a global blue chip oeM customer 
base, many of whom have major facilities in the UK and the rest of 
europe. The final product is then shipped into world markets from 
these facilities which effectively extends the Group's global reach 
and reduces its dependency on the UK economy.
We have made encouraging progress throughout the year  
with Group revenues up 45% on 2010 and with a significant 
improvement in operating margins
*
. The energy and transportation 
segments have been the principal drivers for this benefiting from 
market recovery and increasing market share. demand within the 
utilities segment also increased through the year albeit from a lower 
base. There was a modest improvement in aerospace performance 
through the second half of the year.

EnERGY
our Malvern Tubular components business specialises in fabricated and 
manipulated tubular assemblies for large diesel engines and radiator sets used 
within the energy sector, principally power generation, mining and oil and gas 
applications. We have made good progress through the year with revenue up 
81% on the previous year.  With demand remaining strong, we committed to 
significant investment in plant and equipment through the latter part of the 
financial year which will position us well for further growth. looking forward,  
we expect this investment to continue at significantly higher levels than in 
recent years.
TRAnSpORTATiOn
Maxpower automotive is focused on nylon, rigid and hybrid tubular products 
for engines, braking systems and fuel sender sub-systems. revenue increased 
53% year on year as a result of more favourable market conditions and 
additional business secured. The focus on lean implementation has also 
progressed well and the improvement in operating margin has been very 
positive. our development of the next generation of product fixtures that allow 
electronic verification of critical component characteristics has been extremely 
well received by customers and positions us well for new business 
opportunities.
AEROSp AcE
rMdG aerospace supplies rigid pipe assemblies used in a variety of 
applications within the aerospace sector. revenues were broadly similar to the 
previous year but we have experienced some supply chain constraints coupled 
with higher material costs. The delay in being able to pass these increases on to 
our customers has put pressure on operating margins which we expect to 
address over the coming months.
UTiliTiES
redman fittings holds worldwide patents on a unique method of joining 
polyethylene pipes. Its customers include major oeMs which are supplied with 
a branded version of the product which is then incorporated within their 
barrier  pipe systems. These multi layer pipe systems are used within the water 
industry in brown field site developments providing advantages in performance 
and overall cost. revenue increased 77% year on year reflecting higher levels of 
activity in this area. With increasing focus on soil contamination levels we are 
optimistic that this could stimulate further growth within the sector. The 
business continued to deliver double-digit segmental profit margins. 06

finAnciAl REviEw The Group has delivered a strong set of results for the 2010/11 
financial year. It has built on the positive results of 2009/10 and 
continued to focus on its key objectives to improve financial 
performance. as a result it has increased revenue, operating profit
*
 
and ePS
*
, as well as significantly improving the Group's net debt 
position.
This strong performance has resulted in the Board recommending 
the payment of a maiden dividend of 0.1p per share for the 
financial full year. This is part of a longer term progressive dividend 
policy.
incOmE STATEmEnT
compared to 2009/10, revenue for the financial year was up  
45% to  21.764m (2010:  15.031m), driven predominantly by 
improvements in the energy and transportation sectors. 
Gross margins were maintained at 32% despite lower aerospace 
margins. however, the Group continued to focus on controlling its 
administration costs, and was able to further reduce operational 
gearing to 22%. resultant operating profit
*
 was up 282% to 
 1.198m (2010:  0.425m). after deducting intangible asset 
amortisation, share based payment charges and charges relating to 
foreign exchange derivative contracts, operating profit was up 334% 
to  1.026m (2010:  0.307m).
finance charges for the year were  0.099m (2010:  0.129m), 
although this included a credit relating to the interest rate swap 
valuation of  33k (2010:  8k). despite the Group's lower level of 
net borrowings during the year, finance charges, excluding the 
interest rate swap valuation credit, were in line with last year at 
 0.132m (2010:  0.137m). This is a function of the interest rate cap 
and collar arrangement that the Group has in place over its 
borrowings.
The resultant unadjusted profit before tax was up 521% to 
 0.927m (2010:  0.178m). Basic ePS was up 4.8 times at 2.14p 
(2010: 0.45p) and, after adjusting for one-off costs, ePS was up  
3.2 times at 2.57p (2010: 0.79p).
cASh flO w The Group's net cash flow from operating activities in the year was 
 0.968m (2010:  1.413m). This represents a solid profit to cash 
conversion.
full year capital expenditure of  0.187m (2010:  0.135m) is lower 
than anticipated due to the timing of contract placements on major 
investments. however, at 31 March 2011, the Group had capital 
commitments in place of  0.524m for delivery during 2011/12. 
The Group continued to pay down its borrowings, with net debt 
reduced by 93% to  0.061m and increase its cash and equivalents 
during the year by 24% to  1.612m (2010:  1.296m).

net working capital was in line with the half year result at  
 3.891m (2010:  3.586m). The increase over last year was driven 
predominantly by an increase in trade debtors, due to the increased 
trading volumes. however, the Group managed to maintain the 
lower inventory levels achieved last year against significantly higher 
volumes.
The Group's net debt at the year end was significantly reduced 
by  0.780m to  0.061m (2010: 0.841m). Gearing, measured as 
total debt to equity, at the year end stood at 1%, compared to 
18% in 2010.
pEOplE
We are deeply grateful for the energy, passion and skills of our 
people and we continue to invest in their development.
following the launch of our energise programme last year, around 
two thirds of our employees attended, or are attending, our training 
programmes that see participants attain a national vocational 
qualification in Business Improvement Techniques. This is proving a 
firm foundation for further operational improvement.
nick Silverthorne, Group Technical director left the Board at the 
end of May and we would like to acknowledge his contribution to 
the business over very many years. he will continue to support the 
Group on a part-time basis in a consultancy capacity.
I am also delighted to welcome david leakey to the Board as 
Group Sales director. david, who joins us from IMI plc, has 
extensive experience in oeM account development and will play a 
key role in the execution of the Group's organic growth plans.
OUTlOOk
We have been encouraged by the progress made in the year  
with the Group benefiting from its exposure to global markets, 
increased account penetration and continued focus on operational 
improvement. We accelerated our investment plans through the 
second half of the year and this higher level of investment will 
continue through the current year as we look to capitalise on the 
opportunities we are identifying. alongside our drive for organic 
growth, the Group is continuing to consider potential acquisition 
opportunities.
