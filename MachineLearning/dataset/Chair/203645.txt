 2 Tullow Oil plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Chairman's statement 
Tullow is a versatile and balanced oil and
gas exploration and production group with 
a portfolio of quality assets managed by a
team with excellent technical, commercial
and financial skills. Our strategy is clear 
and our objective is to consistently deliver
value to shareholders.
  A key part of our performance and growth has been our consistent 
ability to attract and retain great people
  Our portfolio of over 200 leads and prospects and our balanced 
approach to developing our assets allows us to allocate resources 
where they will be most effective
  In an industry that is constantly evolving, Tullow has developed a strong
track record of identifying opportunities and executing transactions
Strong performance trends
During 2006, we invested close to  1 billion in
growing the business, including  332 million
on capital expenditure, 70% of which was
invested in our production and development
assets. The 30% increase in revenue and the
Group's operating cash flow of  447 million
comfortably funded all our capital investment
and a dividend 38% higher than that for 2005. 
The spread and balance of our business 
and assets limits our exposure, volatility and 
risk in any single asset or territory, and also
allows us to put in place financing facilities
that would not be available for a single-asset
or single-region company. Thus, we have 
the flexibility to allocate capital to wherever 
it will attract the best return at any time.
Excellent operational delivery 
Each of our three core areas demonstrated
major progress during 2006.
In the UK, gas production increased from 
130 to 172 mmscfd, enabling Tullow to 
take advantage of record gas prices in the
first half of the year. Effective operational
management of the Schooner and Ketch
fields brought average uptime to 98% and
maximum production to over 100 mmscfd.
However, the overall outcome of the 2006
redevelopment programme resulted in a 
45 bcf reduction in reserves for these fields.
The performance of the other SNS producing
assets was positive and, in parallel with
growing production, Tullow also participated
in four successful exploration wells, including
the potentially significant K4 discovery in the
Caister Murdoch System (CMS) Area. These
discoveries, along with the Thurne, Kelvin and
Wissey projects already in progress, form the
basis of our future development programme.
+38% 
increase in dividend per share.
In Africa, Tullow invested over  150 million
during 2006, representing 45% of overall
capital expenditure, and carried out a wide
range of near-infrastructure and high-impact
exploration, infill drilling and development
activity. Our production objectives were
substantially achieved. Infill drilling results
were positive across all fields, and our 
Gabon output was in line with expectations.
On the development front, both the West
Espoir and Okume fields were brought on
stream as anticipated. In exploration, while
the outcome of the programme in Gabon 
was disappointing, results to date from
Uganda have exceeded our most optimistic
expectations and point to the potential for a
world-class new hydrocarbon province to be
delivered by the 2007 and 2008 exploration
and appraisal programmes. Encouraging
progress was also achieved on the Kudu
project in 2006, leading to a two-well appraisal
drilling programme in 2007 which will test
the major upside potential of this strategic
Namibian asset.
In Asia, the regeneration of our portfolio
continued apace in 2006 and the foundations
were laid for an equally exciting 2007
programme. In Bangladesh, first gas was
produced from the Tullow-operated Bangora
project in May and this, together with the
success of the appraisal drilling programme,
led to a declaration of commerciality and 
a material upgrade to year end reserves. 
In Pakistan, ongoing development work 
will result in first gas being produced from
Chachar in the second quarter, while a 
two-well exploration programme on the
potentially significant Kohat Block will start
late this year. Perhaps most encouraging,
however, has been India, where seismic
acquisition undertaken during 2005 and 2006
has led to the delineation of a number of
distinct targets in the CB-ON/1 licence in 
the Cambay Basin, which will be the subject
of a multi-well drilling campaign in 2007.
Carefully managed responsibilities
Tullow recognises that its opportunities 
come with associated responsibilities. Our
commitment to those responsibilities is fully
endorsed by the Board and clearly set out in
our Corporate and Social Responsibility (CSR)
Report and on our website. Our operations
must be safe, our activities transparent and
our environmental impact carefully managed
and monitored. In 2006, Tullow had no
significant environmental, health, safety 
or security issues. The Lost Time Incident
Frequency Ratio (LTIFR) was 0.81, well within
our target of 1.0, despite a 65% increase to
6.1 million hours worked across the Group,
both onshore and offshore, during the year.
Furthermore, our responsibilities also include
working with communities in a sustainable
manner. In 2006, Tullow spent US$1.5 million
in funding social and community projects  Tullow Oil plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 3

proud of our activities to date in Uganda
where, in addition to establishing local
agricultural, fishing and manufacturing
enterprises, our Lake Rescue support
programme has already saved lives. 
Focused growth strategy
The combination of our excellent operating
performance and a positive macro
environment has enabled Tullow to focus 
on the long-term growth and health of our
business and portfolio, and invest accordingly.
The most obvious example of this during 
2006 was the  595 million acquisition of
Hardman Resources Limited (Hardman)
announced in September and completed 
in January 2007. The Hardman acquisition
represented an outstanding strategic
opportunity for Tullow and is a clear
demonstration of the substantial financial
and operational capability of our business
and the skills of our team. Interestingly, 
the acquisition of Hardman cost less than
Tullow's combined capital expenditure for
2006 and projected 2007 expenditure, an
effective illustration of the scale the Group
has achieved and the major opportunities
present within our existing portfolio. Our
strong cash flow and rigorous approach to
the management of financial risk allows us to
implement our growth plans with confidence
while comfortably servicing net debt of over 
 450 million following this acquisition. 
A dynamic external environment
The continued strength of oil and gas pricing
has prompted a significant acceleration 
of exploration, development and corporate
activity in the sector. This rapid build up of
activity has created pressure on the supply 
of people, rigs, oil field services and seismic
vessels, leading to sharply increased costs.
Similarly, the strong cash flows being
generated by oil and gas companies have
increased competition for quality acreage 
and assets including corporate deals. 
In the UK gas market, following
unprecedented pricing in early 2006, the
recent addition of much-needed pipeline
capacity and impact of a comparatively mild
winter have combined to drive gas prices for
the first quarter of this year down to 2003
levels. Looking forward, the overall underlying
supply and demand fundamentals, allied to
the gradual convergence of UK and European
gas markets, means the outlook continues to
be positive. The oil market has also retreated
from a mid-2006 high. However, current and
forward pricing remains extremely attractive
in historic terms, supporting Tullow's overall
strategy of investing in the development 
of long-life oil assets such as Okume in
Equatorial Guinea, Espoir in C te d'Ivoire,
Chinguetti in Mauritania and M'Boundi in
Congo (Brazzaville) and exploring in exciting
territories such as Uganda and India.
The  595 million acquisition of Hardman 
cost less than Tullow's combined 2006 
and projected 2007 capital expenditure.
Investing in people 
In 2006, we strengthened the Board with 
the appointment of three new Directors. 
Paul McDade, the Group's Chief Operating
Officer, was appointed to the Board in March,
while Angus McCoss, who joined Tullow 
as General Manager Exploration in April 
2006, was appointed to the Board and 
as Exploration Director in December. 
In June, David Williams joined as a 
non-executive Director. 
Our strong reputation enables us to 
recruit top people and, combined with the
development of internal talent, puts us in an
excellent position to capitalise on the exciting
opportunities available to Tullow. At a 
time when our sector is increasingly 
resource constrained, the Group is well
placed for the future with over 45% of 
our staff being under 45 years of age 
and with 100 people in an operational 
or technical capacity.
Positive positioning and outlook
The balance and diversity of Tullow's business
allows us to adapt swiftly to opportunities as
they arise and to tailor our investment plans
to the changing circumstances of the industry. 
Our production assets, along with our
development and exploration activities and
the Hardman business, leave Tullow with 
a high-quality, opportunity-rich portfolio 
in each of its core areas. Our business is
healthy and growing and should remain 
so for the foreseeable future.
