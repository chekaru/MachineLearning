Chairman's statement
.................................................................................................................................................................
Overview I am pleased to report another year of record turnover which reached  119 million, up
39% on the previous year and EBITDA profits of  1.4 million. ukbetting's content network,
which generates significant revenues from advertising, content sales and affiliate
revenues, performed well, despite removing competitor bookmaker advertising in
November 2005. Oddschecker had an excellent year helped by the introduction of poker
checker and casino checker.
During 2005, casino and poker performed well, contributing 65% of gaming gross win
with revenues up 72% on 2004. However, sports betting was once again disappointing,
contributing only the same level of gross win as in 2004, despite significantly
increased turnover.
Operations
Gaming turnover grew by 47% to  105 million with gross win up 45% to  11.5 million.
2005 saw 90,000 new gaming registrations of which 60% came from the Group's
network of sites. Casino and poker revenue grew by 68% and 78% respectively despite
requiring a different registration and money deposit process from the sports betting
operations. However, by the summer of 2006 a single wallet to cover all gaming and
betting products will be in place, which is expected to lead to a much-improved
conversion of customers to a wider range of products. Currently the instant play casino,
which is already integrated, delivers a 70% higher conversion from sports book than the
full download version.
During the year the Group had 92,000 active betting and gaming customers up from
67,000 last year. Not only do the majority of these customers originate from the content
network but, as they return to obtain information on the latest scores and tips, we see a
better retention rate and higher propensity to bet from these customers.
As a result of the disappointing performance of sports betting, an internally developed
automated risk management system was built in the second half of 2005. This allowed for
the restructure of the trading room at the end of January 2006 and the implementation of
automated trading tools. These factors, plus a reduction in the cost base, are already
creating an improvement in the profitability of the fixed odds business.
Since third party bookmaker advertising was removed from the content sites in November
last year, the click-throughs to betting and gaming have increased to 200,000 clicks per
month. This gives ukbetting a uniquely low cost model for acquiring gaming customers and
with the cost of customer acquisition continuing to rise, it puts the Group in a unique
position for 2006 ahead of the World Cup.
The single wallet for poker is scheduled for June and the downloadable casino single
wallet will then follow. Once a single wallet is available for all the betting and gaming
products there will be a significant opportunity to exploit our growing content customer
database, via direct marketing, to introduce customers to the complete gaming
product range. ukbetting plc

Operations

Content sales performed well in 2005 with consumer advertising sales up  0.4 million,
20% ahead of 2004. There was also an excellent performance from Oddschecker with
sales up by 15% despite the previous year having the benefit of Euro 2004. Oddschecker
will further benefit from its soon to be re-built casino and poker comparison sites, its new
mobile offering and a multilingual version planned ahead of the World Cup.
Traffic for video through sportal.com grew substantially in the final quarter of the year and
clips viewed have increased a further 70% since year end. The Group will look to exploit
this demand by acquiring cost effective rights packages as well as building on our sports
community strength with fan based shows and clips. These will be implemented within the
site build programme, commencing with teamtalk.tv in April 2006. Web, audio and
mobile content sales to third parties performed well. Encouragingly, towards the end of
2005, we saw the launch on mobile of our branded sites such as football365 in
association with leading mobile network operators. These will become a more important
and valuable revenue stream on 3G, GPRS and iMode in 2006.
The network generated 8.5 million monthly users and 302 million page impressions views
a month, the number of pages benefiting from an improvement in IT infrastructure during the
final quarter allowing faster access during peak sporting occasions. The sites will further
benefit from a major rebuild programme, which started in January 2006, which adds a
host of new features, advertising formats and on-site broadband TV as well as audio. The
programme commenced with the launch of TEAMtalk.com in March and all sites will be
re-built by the end of the summer. We also plan multilingual versions of Oddschecker
ahead of the World Cup and a multilingual football site by the end of the year.
Financial overview
Group turnover in the year was  118.8 million (2004:  85.6 million). The gaming
division turnover was  105.2 million (2004:  71.7 million) and the content division
produced turnover of  13.6 million (2004:  13.9 million).
The turnover growth is detailed in the operations section above and is mainly organic
growth with  9.0 million of the  33.2 million increase arising from full year contributions
from the acquisition of In The Box Media and Campbells in 2004.
The gross profit generated within the divisions has increased to  22.4 million (2004:
 19.0 million). The gaming division produced a gross profit (gross win less taxes and
levies) of  10.7 million (2004:  7.3 million) reflecting continued growth in the casino
and poker products introduced in 2003. The content division gross profit has been
maintained at  11.7 million (2004:  11.7 million) despite the sacrifice of some third
party bookmaker advertising revenues.
Operating expenses incurred during the year are  23.2 million (2004:  25.7 million).
The content division operating expenses fell to  10.5 million (2004:  11.7 million)
reflecting the cost efficiencies achieved from the integration of the Rivals business. The
gaming division operating expenses are  10.3 million (2004:  8.5 million), reflecting
the continued growth in casino and poker and a full year of the costs of Campbells. ukbetting plc

Financial overview

Goodwill amortisation costs have reduced to  1.5 million (2004:  4.3 million)
as a consequence of the 2004 impairment charge to goodwill arising on the
original acquisition of ukbetting.com Limited in 2001. Central costs are  0.9 million
(2004:  1.2 million).
EBITDA profit is  1.4 million (2004:  0.1 million before exceptional items and
non-recurring costs). Group operating losses are  0.8 million (2004: loss of  6.7 million).
The loss for the financial year is  1.2 million (2004: loss of  7.0 million).
Taxation payable results from the profits of GoldBet that are generated outside of
the UK tax losses.
Losses per share amounted to 1.21p basic and diluted (2004: loss of 7.66p). Adjusted
profit per share was 0.34p (2004: loss of 1.24p), fully diluted adjusted profit per share
was 0.26p (2004: loss of 1.24p).
At the end of the year, the consolidated balance sheet shows net assets of  6.9 million
(2004:  8.2 million). During the year the Company issued further equity capital
of  0.1 million (2004:  nil) through the exercise of employee share options. The
total banking facilities available to Group from Bank of Scotland are  4.1 million.
These facilities are available as a term facility that was used to acquire Campbells
(now  1.1 million), and a working capital facility of up to  3.0 million of which
 1.9 million was drawn at the year-end.
At the year end cash held was  0.7 million (2003:  1.3 million) and the net debt was
 2.4 million (2004: net debt  1.0 million).
Post the year end the Company completed an  11.5 million placing ( 11.0 million net of
costs). The banking facilities remain in place with the working capital facility not utilised.
Outlook
2006 has started well with consumer advertising up 20% on last year's first quarter and
gaming margin has risen to 12.5% compared to 11.9% of last year. Historically sports
betting in the UK has been considerably loss-making which has overshadowed the true
profits of the Group. The management believes that the new structure it has put in place will
neutralise this problem, allowing the profits from the rest of the Group to be clearly visible.
The focus of the Group is to improve the profitability of the sports betting business, to
maximise gaming revenue opportunities offered by the single wallet, to complete the
content site build programme with new advertising formats and to enter new territories with
multilingual versions of selected sites.
