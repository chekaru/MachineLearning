 Overview 
I am very pleased to report that Umeco
continues to develop and prosper. Our results
for 2008 are considerably ahead of the prior
year and the strategic developments we 
have effected during the year leave us well
positioned for further substantial growth. 
Demand for the Group's products and services
in our main market, civil aerospace, remains
robust, despite the recent announcements 
by Boeing and Airbus of further delays in 
the production of the B787 and the A380.
Strategic developments
Following a strategic review in the early 
part of the financial year the Board 
decided to focus Umeco on its larger 
and faster growing business activities of
Composites and Supply Chain. This led 
to the divestment in November 2007 
of the smallest business activity, Repair 
& Overhaul; and in March 2008 of our 
aerospace chemicals distribution businesses
( Chemicals'). The cash consideration received
from this divestment programme was  49.0
million giving rise to a profit of  9.9 million.
Two important acquisitions were completed
during the year, both in Composites. In 
August 2007, we finalised the acquisition 
of J. D. Lincoln, Inc. ( Lincoln') for an initial 
cash consideration of US$59.5 million. 
Lincoln, based at two sites in California,
formulates and manufactures a range of
pre-impregnated materials ( pre-pregs')
primarily used by aerospace tier 2 suppliers
for the manufacture of composite interior
structures of commercial aircraft. It has a
wide range of qualifications, including those
recently added for the Boeing B787 and the
Airbus A380. In November 2007, we
announced the acquisition of George Cole
Technologies Limited which traded as Primco
for a cash consideration of  3.0 million.
Primco, now trading under the Advanced
Composites Group (  ACG') brand, which is
based in Manchester, is also a materials
business that develops and manufactures 
a range of pre-pregs used in aerospace,
defence, industrial, medical and sporting
applications. Primco holds a number of
product qualifications including several
related to Airbus interior materials. Both
acquisitions are highly complementary to

Umeco's existing aerospace composites
activities which are focused on the airframe
and have performed ahead of our initial
expectations. 
In Supply Chain, a significant extension to the
Group's long term contract with Rolls-Royce
plc was signed in November 2007. Through 
a dedicated new facility in Derby, Umeco now
provides Rolls-Royce with a much broader
range of parts and services, helping them to
meet the growing demand for their aerospace
engine range and to enhance further their
aftermarket customer service. As part of the
revised agreement, the contract timeframe
was also extended by a further five years and
will now run until December 2015.
Results and dividend
Revenue from continuing operations, 
Composites and Supply Chain, in the year 
to 31 March 2008 was  335.2 million (2007:
 282.1 million) an increase of 18.8 per cent. 
Of the  53.1 million increase  13.2 million
relates to acquisitions; the underlying
increase in revenue was therefore 14.1 per
cent or 14.6 per cent at constant exchange
Umeco continues to develop and prosper. Demand for the Group's products 
and services in our main market, civil aerospace, remains robust

rates. Revenue including Repair & Overhaul
and Chemicals was  380.7 million 
(2007:  333.9 million). 
Operating profit from continuing activities
rose by 26.0 per cent to  27.1 million 
(2007:  21.5 million) with margins showing 
a further improvement to 8.1 per cent
(2007: 7.6 per cent). Of the  5.6 million
increase  2.3 million relates to acquisitions.
Including Repair & Overhaul and Chemicals,
operating profit was  30.7 million 
(2007:  25.7 million).
Net interest charges, excluding revaluations 
of financial instruments, were  5.2 million
(2007:  3.2 million). This increase reflects the
significant capital investments, acquisitions
and volume-related rise in working capital
arising in the Group over the past twelve
months. The full interest effect of the
divestment programme, completed in 
March 2008, will be seen in the current
financial year.
Profit before tax from continuing activities
was  21.9 million (2007:  18.3 million), an
increase of 19.7 per cent. Including Repair &
Overhaul and Chemicals, profit before tax was
 25.5 million (2007:  22.5 million). Earnings
per share were 36.7 pence compared to
32.2 pence, an increase of 14.0 per cent.
The Directors are proposing an increased final
dividend of 11.0 pence (2007: 10.0 pence),
making a total for the year of 17.0 pence per
ordinary share (2007: 15.5 pence) an increase
of 9.7 per cent. The final dividend is payable
on 1 August 2008 to shareholders on the
register on 4 July 2008.
Directors
At the AGM in July 2007 Michael Harper
retired as a non-executive Director due to his
other business commitments and we thank
him for his invaluable support and advice
during the period he was on the Board.
Chris Hole, who until December 2006 was
Director of Procurement at Rolls-Royce, joined
the Board in July 2007 as Michael's replacement.
Doug Robertson was appointed Finance
Director following the retirement of John
Beaumont in July 2007, after over 13 years'
service. Doug held the same role with Seton
House Group until April 2007. We wish John 
a long and happy retirement.
Andrew Moss, Chief Executive of Umeco
Composites since 1999, is today appointed to
the Board in the new role of Chief Operating
Officer. Andrew has been instrumental in the
development of Umeco Composites and,
following our recent refocusing, is the right
person to continue to drive forward our
operational performance across both
Composites and Supply Chain.

Management and employees
In a year of some considerable change for 
the Group I welcome the management and
employees of the newly acquired businesses
and wish to place on record our appreciation
to the staff of Repair & Overhaul and
Chemicals for their dedicated service during
the period of our ownership and to all our
staff for their continued commitment and
hard work.
Prospects
As in the prior year, our considerable rate of
progress was held back primarily by a number
of external factors including the production
delays of the A380 and the B787 and, for most
of the year, rising interest rates. Despite these
factors we again delivered a high level of
underlying growth in revenue and profits.
The principal market in which Umeco
operates, civil aerospace, looks exceptionally
robust with Airbus and Boeing entering 
2008 with record order books. Airbus has
restarted A380 production though Boeing's
development of the B787 is behind schedule
with initial deliveries now due in late 2009.
Both of these significant programmes are
anticipated to generate a high level of
incremental revenue for the Group in the
medium and long term.
The demand for our broadening range 
of advanced composite materials in the
aerospace and other growth markets
continues at a high rate; this is leading 
to increasing utilisation of our extended
capacity. In the coming year, further
investments are planned at Lincoln and 
we will continue to focus on the rapidly
expanding wind energy market. The selection
of ACG by Airbus to participate in the Next
Generation Composite Wing ( NGCW') research
programme, announced in May 2008, is a
major strategic milestone for the Group.
These factors, coupled with the acquisitions 
of Lincoln and Primco together with the
considerable benefits of the extended 
Rolls-Royce contract, put Umeco on track 
for another year of strong growth. 
We go into the new financial year as a more
focused Group with a strong order book,
robust demand from the markets in which 
we operate and an enhanced infrastructure
following the major investments we have
made over the last four years. We are looking
forward to another successful year.
Brian McGowan
Chairman
3 June 2008
Having completed the divestment of our Repair & Overhaul
and Chemicals business, we will focus on our core activities of
Composites and Supply Chain.  Both have excellent long term
growth characteristics and operate in buoyant markets
