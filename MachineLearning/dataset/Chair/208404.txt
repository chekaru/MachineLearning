 Mineral Resource Statement
AMC Consultants Pty Ltd (AMC ) completed a Mineral Resource
Estimate for VGM using geological and assay data available at 30
March 2011. The data supplied by VGM allowed AMC to
generate a constrained grade model and estimate a Mineral
Resource. AMC estimated the Mineral Resources using the
end of June 2011 surveyed face positions. The Mineral
Resources at 31 August 2011 were estimated by subtracting
the production for the months of July and August 2011.
The VGM Mineral Resource estimate is classified into
Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources based on
the current drillhole spacing, quality of the drilling information
and confidence in the geological controls on the gold
mineralisation and grade continuity. The Mineral Resource
estimate includes Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources
that will convert to Ore Reserves on application of modifying
factors.
The AMC Mineral Resource estimate is classified and reported
in accordance with the 2004 JORC Code.

Vatukoula Layout 2011 1.7_Layout 1  30/12/2011  12:39  Page 33 The following notes highlight assumptions used to generate
the VGM underground Mineral Resource estimate:
  An intercept width times gold the cut of grade (COG ) of 4 
metre grams of gold per tonne (m.g/t Au) and a gold 
COG of 2 grams of gold per tonne were applied to the 
resource models to obtain the estimated Mineral Resources.
  The Mineral Resource models were depleted for mining to 
31 August 2011, using surveyed mine outlines to 30 June 
2011 and production figures for July and August 2011 
  The Mineral Resource models use geological and assay 
data available at 15 April 2011.
  The mineralised envelope was defined using geological 
logging and assay information from diamond drillholes 
using a nominal lower gold cut-off grade of 1 m g/t Au.
  Extrapolation of the interpreted mineralised structure was 
limited to 20m to 50m between section lines and 5m to 
25m at the ends of each section.
  Samples are prepared and analysed by fire assay using a 
25g charge at the on-site laboratory.
  In situ density data was available from drillhole sampling. 
Densities were assigned to each of the modelled structures
based on the average results from all available samples.
  The estimation method used 3D wireframe and block 
modelling projected to a 2D plane, with ordinary kriging 
interpolation. A grade variable (the product of the 
horizontal or vertical intercept width and grade) was 
estimated using modelled semi-variograms and 
geostatistical analysis to determine kriging search 
parameters. The intercept width was estimated separately 
and the grade back-calculated.
  Grade times thickness top-cutting was applied in 
calculating the grade times thickness variable.
  The metallurgical response for the orebodies is well 
understood from actual production. No recovery factors 
were applied to the Mineral Resource estimate.
Tailings Mineral Resource
The Tailings Mineral Resource estimate is an estimate
developed by CSA Global (CSA ).  In March 2008, CSA
compiled an independent Competent Persons Report titled An
Independent Competent Persons report for River Diamonds
PLC covering the Vatukoula Gold Mine in Fiji, the Panguma
Prospect in Sierra Leone and the Rio Novo Gold Prospect in
Brazil (CSA CPR), for inclusion in the application for
readmission to trading on the Alternative Investment Market
(AIM) of the London Stock Exchange.
  The CSA CPR reported the 2006 Mineral Resources, 
including the Tailings Mineral Resource, according to the 
JORC Code. No further estimates or data is available at the
time of this report. AMC cannot verify the estimate and 
allocate a low reliability to the estimate.
  The Tailings Mineral Resource is 200,000 ounces of gold, 
and approximately 10% of the total Measured and 
Indicated Mineral Resources at VGM. AMC believes that 
the Tailings Mineral Resource may provide an opportunity 
to improve the output of the operation, but also believes 
the relevance of the Tailings Mineral Resource is low. VGM 
plans to review the tailings resource in conjunction with the 
results of exploration programmes currently under way, to 
determine the preferred means to extract the contained 
gold. VGM production plans do not include the Tailings 
Mineral Resource pending this review and conversion of 
mineral resources to ore reserves.
Overall there has been an increase in 201,000 ounces from the
2010 Mineral Resources. These changes are attributable to:
  reductions due to depletion of the models between faces - 
126,000 ounces of gold.
  additions due to reinterpretation of previously modelled 
mineralised structures - 214,000 ounces of gold.
  additions due to modelling of additional mineralised 
structures - 113,000 ounces of gold.

Based on the mine design generated by AMC and within the
Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource portions of the
underground VGM deposits, AMC estimated a Proved and
Probable Ore Reserve of 3.3 Mt at 7.5 grams of gold per tonne
for contained gold of 0.79 Moz using a gold price of
US$1400/oz with a 4.48 grams of gold per tonne cut-off.
The methodology used to determine the 2011 ore reserve
estimate required stopes to be split into panels to allow some
stopes to be partially mined such that only the panels with
reserve classification were considered. Access development to
the reserve stopes has been added to the mine plan if the
panels meets the reserve classification. 
The VGM Ore Reserve estimate is classified and reported in
the Mineral Reserve Table below in accordance with the 2004
JORC Code.
The reduction in Ore Reserve estimate from the 2010 estimate
is mainly attributable to mining depletion over the past year,
with some minor additions due to changes in the stope
designs and cut-off grade.
Mineral Resources were converted to Ore Reserves
recognising the level of confidence in the Mineral Resource
estimate and reflecting any modifying factors. Ore Reserves
are included in the Mineral Resources estimate throughout this
report.
The metal prices, grades, recoveries and costs were used to
identify mineable blocks to be included in the Ore Reserve
estimate. The metal prices and exchange rate used in the
Ore Reserve estimate are:
  Gold: US$1400/oz
  Exchange Rate: F$1.00 = US$0.54.
The underground Ore Reserve estimates comprise the portions
of the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources for which
the appropriate mine planning has been undertaken and can
be economically mined. The Ore Reserves are derived from the
Mineral Resources by application of cut-off grades, stoping
heights, dilution factors and extraction ratio.
The Proved Ore Reserve estimate is based on Mineral
Resources classified as Measured, while the Probable Ore
Reserve estimate is based on Mineral Resources classified as
Indicated after consideration of all mining, metallurgical, social,
environmental, statutory and financial aspects of the project.
The Ore Reserve statement is based on information compiled
by Mr Junior Oding under the direct supervision of Mr David
Lee. Mr Oding and Mr Lee are both Members of the
Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and full-time
employees of AMC Consultants Pty Ltd. Mr Lee has sufficient
relevant experience to be a Competent Person as defined by
the JORC Code.
The following notes highlight assumptions used to estimate
the VGM Ore Reserve estimate:
  Cut-off grade of 4.48 grams of gold per tonne.
  Minimum stope mining width of 1.07m.
  10% stope mining dilution.
  95% development recovery
AMC estimated the Ore Reserves using the end of June 2011
surveyed face positions. The Ore Reserve at 31 August 2011
was estimated by subtracting the production for the months of
July and August 2011.
