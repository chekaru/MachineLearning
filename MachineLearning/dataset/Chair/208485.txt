 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (continued)
Relations with Shareholders
The Company values the views of its shareholders and
recognises their interest in the Company's strategy and
performance, board membership and quality of management.
The AGM is used to communicate with all shareholder and
investor groups and they are encouraged to participate.  The
Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees are
available to answer questions.  Separate resolutions are
proposed on each issue so that they can be given proper
consideration and there is a resolution to receive the annual
report and accounts.  The Company counts all proxy votes and
will indicate the level of proxies lodged on each resolution after
it has been dealt with by a show of hands.
The Company uses its website as a means of providing
information to shareholders and other related parties.  The
Company's annual report and accounts, interim results and other
relevant announcements are maintained on the website.
VEBNET ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006
We have audited the financial statements of Vebnet (Holdings)
plc for the year ended 30 June 2006 which comprise the
consolidated profit and loss account, the balance sheets, the
consolidated cash flow statement, the notes to the consolidated
cash flow statement and the related notes 1 to 20. These
financial statements have been prepared under the historic cost
convention and accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body,
in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company's members those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditors' report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,
or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors
and auditors 
As described in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities, the
Company's directors are responsible for the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you
if, in our opinion, the Directors' Report is consistent with the
financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding directors' remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed. 
We read the other information contained in the annual report,
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. This other information comprises only the
Chairman's Statement, the Directors' Report and the Corporate
Governance Statement. We consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with the financial statements. We are
not required to consider whether the Board's statement on
internal control covers all risks and controls, or form an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Group's Corporate Governance
procedures or its risk and control procedures. Our responsibilities
do not extend to any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board.  An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.  It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in
the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group's circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or
error.  In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial
statements. 
Opinion 
In our opinion the financial statements:
  give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the
Company's and Group's affairs as at 30 June 2006 and of 
the Group's profit and cash flows for the year then 
ended; and
 have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985. 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors' Report is
consistent with the financial statements.
