 Chairman's Statement
 We have continued to transform Axeon  
this year by securing a first major customer 
for our automotive batteries and by the 
acquisition of Ristma AG to deliver a pan-
European footprint with additional product 
segments in power tools and mobility. 
During 2007 Axeon continued the rapid 
revenue growth established in 2006. 
The start of production of large electric 
vehicle lithium-ion battery packs coupled 
with the acquisition of Ristma AG has 
positioned Axeon for further significant 
growth during 2008.
Key events
Having successfully integrated Advanced 
Batteries Limited (ABL) into Axeon during 
the second half of 2006, the acquisition 
of Ristma AG in August 2007 has 
fulfilled our objective of achieving a 
pan-European footprint. The acquisition 
was financed by the issue of 7 .85 million 
shares at 64p/share raising  4. 7 million 
net of fees. At the same time the 
company put in place an $8.75 million 
debt facility. The acquisition has further 
accelerated revenue growth, providing  
an established revenue stream from 
supplying cordless power tool customers 
and an emerging business supplying 
battery packs for mobile products in the 
industrial, medical, commercial and 
leisure markets. The acquisition has also 
provided a platform to enable roll-out 
across Europe of our electric vehicle 
lithium-ion battery packs. The successful 
start of production of these packs in 
October 2007 for our first customer 
represented a major milestone for Axeon. 
Building on this product launch it was 
particularly pleasing to be able  
to announce customers in Italy before  
the end of the year . The placing of  
13.33 million shares at 90p/share at the 
end of the year, raising  11.4 million net 
of fees, completed a year of significant 
activity and progress. I believe this 
positions the company with the right 
products, breadth and balance sheet  
to be able to deliver significant further 
growth during 2008.
Improved results
T urnover for the year to 31 December 
2007 increased more than tenfold to 
 29,316,000 (2006:  2,551,000).  
Profit before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation (EBITDA) is now 
positive at  140,000 (2006: Loss of 
 947,000). Loss after tax was reduced 
by 42% to  502,000 (2006:  864,000). 
Operating costs in the year increased by 
28% to  3,306,000 (2006:  2,575,000) 
following the acquisition of Ristma AG. 
Investment in research and development 
was increased by 46% to  1,489,000 
(2006:  1,021,000) reflecting our 
continued commitment to being a 
technology-led product-based company. 
The balance sheet at the end of the year 
was considerably strengthened with net 
assets at  19,574,000 (2006:  3,650,000) 
of which cash and cash equivalents were 
 12,028,000 (2006:  1,669,000).
Market trends
The advances in lithium-ion battery 
technology and the acknowledged 
importance of CO
2
 emissions reductions 
are two significant trends that underpin 
the growth path of Axeon.
Lithium-ion battery chemistry provides 
an energy and power density at a price 
that is enabling a range of products 
to become mobile. Examples of new 
products include cordless hedge 
trimmers and lawn mowers, electric 
wheelchairs, electric sports cars, buses, 
taxis, delivery vehicles and city cars.  
The chemistry continues to evolve in 
terms of energy density, power density, 
durability and energy storage capacity. 
There are now a large number of different 
cell types available from over 150 
different suppliers. For Axeon this means 
we have a wide range of cells from which 
we can offer our customers the best value 
solution for their needs. Given the rate of

(Continued)
change of cell supplier performance  
we try to make sure our customers are 
dual-sourced so that newer cells can  
be switched into their packs as they 
become available.
In 2007 governments and companies 
have started to move from debating the 
need to reduce CO
2
 transport emissions 
to debating the necessary policy levers 
and implementation plans to achieve 
such reductions. The views on credible 
technical paths to emissions reductions 
have also moved decisively in favour 
of electric and plug-in hybrid electric 
vehicles. Recent reports such as the King 
Review for the UK government and the 
Plugged-in Report produced by the World 
Wildlife Fund (WWF) both favoured the 
electric transport future. The King Review 
clearly demonstrated that electric vehicles 
and plug-in hybrids offer the lowest 
CO
2
 emissions per mile in comparison 
to current vehicles, biofuels or fuel cell 
vehicles, even taking into account the use 
of fossil fuels for electricity generation. 
The WWF report made the arguments 
even more forcefully, illustrating the 
environmental and economic damage 
that biofuels are causing and observing 
that fuel cell technology is neither 
appropriate nor effective for CO
2
 
reduction.
The activity in the electric vehicles space 
is picking up, with first movers now in 
production and a rapidly expanding 
group of companies planning to enter the 
market in the UK and continental Europe 
over the next two years.
Our strategy
The strategy of the business is to 
continue to build through organic growth. 
We plan to use our battery management 
and battery systems engineering 
intellectual property and know-how  
as sources of competitive advantage.  
This will be applied to the wider range of 
emerging and established markets where 
lithium-ion cell chemistry is enabling 
new products in the automotive, power 
tool and mobility markets. Axeon acts as 
a system integrator between customers 
and cell suppliers to provide customers 
with solutions tailored to their specific 
needs backed up by warranty and volume 
manufacturing capability. This ensures 
that customers remain independent of 
cell suppliers, thus maximising supply 
flexibility and quality while minimising 
their costs. Our aim is to become the 
most significant pack supplier in each 
market segment in each geographic 
region, starting with Europe, and then 
expanding into the US and SE Asia.
Our people
The board has recognised the need to 
both broaden and deepen the senior 
executive team of Axeon to manage  
the rapidly expanding nature of the 
company in a structured, risk-adjusted 
manner. I was delighted to be able 
to announce the appointment of Don 
Newton as Group T echnical Director  
and Jim Ferguson as Group COO.  
They both bring relevant expertise from 
larger organisations and the board 
looks forward to their contribution to the 
business. John Blinkhorne has stepped 
down from the board and is taking on 
new responsibilities leading overseas 
business development and relationships 
with key cell suppliers.
In addition the company has made a 
number of appointments in marketing, 
finance and engineering to broaden 
the team. Professional head count is 
anticipated to rise to around 117 by the 
year end. The majority of new staff will  
fill engineering roles to meet the needs  
of the expanding customer base.
Paul Johnston will retire as a non-
executive director of Axeon at our 
AGM on 30 June. Paul has had a long 
association with Axeon, initially as an 
advisor to the company in its very early 
days and more recently as a non-
executive director. The board would like  
to thank Paul for his unstinting support 
for the business.
Outlook
The outlook for the business remains 
positive with increasing customer 
demand across all market segments. 
Of particular note is the rapidly evolving 
nature of the electric vehicle market 
both in the UK and continental Europe. 
We look forward to a number of new 
entrants starting to supply to these 
markets during 2008/2009. Having 
established a nascent customer base 
in the US the board is also evaluating 
how best to invest in developing the 
business there. The board continues to 
believe that the global thrust to reduce 
transportation CO
2
 emissions will provide 
a regulatory and customer environment 
that is favourable for electric vehicles. 
The board sees investing in growth as the 
appropriate strategy for the business and 
will continue to increase investment in 
R&D and staff to enable this strategy.
