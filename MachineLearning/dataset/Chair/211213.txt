CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The core competence of Vislink is the 
collection of high quality live video, 
wirelessly, from the scene to the 
screen. We provide solutions to two 
core markets: the broadcast market 
for the collection of live news, sport 
and live entertainment events, and 
the video, secure communications 
and surveillance markets such as 
military, law enforcement and public 
safety.
2013 was another year of sustained 
profitable growth for the Group. We 
achieved our objective of sustaining 
half on half growth in revenues and 
profits.
2013 saw a substantial investment 
in new products as we launched the 
new miniaturised wireless camera 
back, extended our range of new 
lightweight satellite terminals and 
began the introduction of new hybrid 
systems, integrating cellular and 
microwave technologies allowing 
our customers the flexibility of 
capturing high definition video or 
data wirelessly anywhere in the world 
from one device. 
The acquisition of Amplifier 
Technology in the summer allowed 
us to increase our product range 
into military applications. Amplifier 
Technology produces amplifiers and 
jamming technology which prevents 
unmanned incendiary devices to be 
activated by using mobile signals. 
It is vital in the protection of 
citizens, equips the modern soldier 
with protection, and complements 
the world-class lightweight 
communications offered by our 
lightweight MSAT satellite terminals. 
As we stated in our November 2011 
strategy document, Vislink is the 
market leader in the broadcast market 
with its range of wireless video 
contribution products representing 
around 20 per cent of the available 
market. We announced further 
delivery of this strategy in March 
2014 with the acquisition of Pebble 
Beach Systems. 
WE CONTINUE 
TO DELIVER ON 
OUR SHORT TERM 
OBJECTIVES OF 
PROFITABLE GROWTH 
WHILST DELIVERING 
AGAINST OUR PLAN, 
SET IN 201 1, OF 
ACHIEVING REVENUES 
OF  80 MILLION AND 
ADJUSTED OPERATING 
PROFIT OF  8 MILLION. 
 
Pebble Beach Systems is a world 
leader in the provision of software for 
automation, Channel in a Box and 
content management solutions for 
TV broadcasters, cable and satellite 
operators. 
The key benefits of Pebble Beach 
Systems are:
 	Leading software technology within 
the sector as demonstrated by its 
worldwide customer base
 	Next generation products recently 
developed
 	Growing customer base   50  
per cent of its top ten customers 
last year were new
 	Strong cash generation and growth 
prospects
The acquisition fits perfectly with 
Vislink's desire for growth, recurring 
revenues, extending its reach and 
providing customers with synergies, 
from capturing video to interactive 
programming, including acquisition 
and revenue generation. Vislink 
plans to grow its software capability 
around the Pebble Beach Systems and 
management team. 
Pebble Beach Systems was 
acquired in March 2014 for a total 
consideration of  14.9 million 
comprising  12.9 million in cash 
and  2.0 million represented by the 
issue of new Vislink Ordinary Shares. 
The cash consideration was funded 
out of existing Group resources and 
a new  10.0 million debt facility. 
The facility has a three year tenor 
and is split  3.0 million amortising 
term loan and  7.0 million flexible 
revolving credit facility.
Upon completion the Group cash 
balance was strengthened by  5.9 
million of cash retained in Pebble 
Beach Systems' balance sheet. 
The acquisition transitions Vislink 
into a market leading full service 
video capture and playout provider to 
the broadcast industry.

Annual Report & Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013 23313.04     14 April 2014 7:42 AM      PROOF 1 23313.04     14 April 2014 7:42 AM      PROOF 1
THE BOARD 
WERE PLEASED 
TO ANNOUNCE 
THE ACQUISITION 
OF PEBBLE BEACH 
SYSTEMS, A WORLD 
LEADER IN SOFTWARE 
FOR PLAYOUT 
AUTOMATION 
AND CONTENT 
MANAGEMENT 
SOLUTIONS FOR 
BROADCASTERS. 
Order intake for the year was  60.1 
million and the opening order book 
for this year stood at  5.6 million 
(2012:  5.2 million).
The reported adjusted operating 
profit was  4.3 million (2012:  
 3.1 million), a 40.3 per cent 
increase compared to 2012. 
The Group has maintained a strong 
balance sheet throughout the year 
and remained debt free. 
There were some working capital 
increases throughout the year 
associated with our growth and 
investments in new products. 
EARNINGS PER SHARE
The reported basic undiluted earnings 
per share for the year was 3.1 pence 
(2012: 1.9 pence). 
After adjusting for amortisation and 
impairment of acquired intangibles 
the Group's adjusted earnings per 
share was 4.2 pence (2012: adjusted 
earnings per share of 2.5 pence). 
DIVIDENDS 
The Board is proposing that the full 
year dividend be maintained at 1.25 
pence per share (2012: 1.25 pence 
per share). 
ACQUISITIONS
In 2013 we primarily concentrated 
on organic growth although we did 
complete the bolt on  acquisition 
of Amplifier Technology which we 
funded from operating cash flows. 
The total consideration for Amplifier 
Technology was  4.0 million  
( 2.0 million on completion 
and a further  2.0 million if the 
company achieves earnings before 
interest, taxation, depreciation and 
amortisation (EBITDA) of  3.0 
million by June 2014, and achieves 
cash generated from earnings of  
 2.4 million). 
The acquisitions of Pebble Beach 
Systems completed in March 2014 
and Amplifier Technology completed 
in August 2013 will contribute to the 
strategy of achieving higher recurring 
services revenues and achieving our 
financial objectives of  80.0 million 
revenue and  8.0 million adjusted 
operating profit by the end of FY 
2014. Further bolt on  acquisitions 
will be considered throughout 2014 
to achieve our short term and longer 
term growth aspirations.
03 04
Early in 2014 we have won a 
multi-million pound contract in 
public	safety	in	the	UK	which	
will significantly contribute to 
our declared strategy of having at 
least 25 per cent of our revenues 
being derived from the secure 
communication and surveillance 
markets by the end of the financial 
year 2014. 
Our markets continue to be tough 
but as long as we continue to better 
balance our business and maintain 
our product leadership, the Group 
will grow in profitability. 
FINANCIAL RESULTS
Group revenues were  59.9 million 
(2012:  57.2 million) which was up 
4.7 per cent on last year (including 
four months' contribution from 
Amplifier T echnology).

We will continue to develop our 
core competences in wireless video 
contribution for both broadcast 
and surveillance and secure 
communications markets. 
We will expand our capability in 
delivering recurring revenues by 
exploiting our newly acquired 
software capability in video playout 
and will grow our services offering by 
developing our network capabilities 
in cellular and hybrid application 
areas. 
We will also actively seek 
opportunities to expand our military, 
law enforcement and public safety 
presence both organically and 
through acquisitions.
CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT CONTINUED
STRATEGY
MOVE TO ALTERNATIVE 
INVESTMENT MARKET (AIM)
On 20 January 2014 the Group 
moved from a listing on the main 
market, to AIM. The primary 
reason for this, as announced in 
our circular, was to simplify and 
reduce the financial burden of 
making acquisitions. As part of the 
transformation of the Group, bolt 
on  acquisitions were a key part of 
our three-year plan, 2011-2014. 
We will continue to seek growth 
opportunities both organically 
and through acquisitions, whilst 
with a clear underlying objective 
of continuing to grow shareholder 
value.

SHAREHOLDERS' 
OBJECTIVES OF 
DELIVERING SHORT

PROFITABLE GROWTH.

THE BOARD, 
MANAGEMENT AND 
EMPLOYEES
We continue to see a strengthening 
of our capabilities and expertise as we 
acquire new businesses.
On behalf of the Board I would like 
to thank all our people both newly 
joining us through acquisition and 
those that have got behind our 
vision for growth and who have all 
contributed to our success in 2013.
CURRENT OUTLOOK 
TRADING 
Our markets continue to be 
challenging. However, the Group 
enters 2014 with renewed confidence 
buoyed by the introduction of new 
products and the added momentum 
which has come from the synergistic 
bolt on  acquisitions. 
We are confident of the opportunities 
that will come from our enlarged 
footprint in both broadcast and 
the secure communication and 
surveillance markets. 
We are executing to the letter  on 
our strategy and remain completely 
aligned to our shareholders' objectives 
of delivering short term and long 
term profitable growth.
