BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Profit before tax for 2006 was 
 2.0m, after allowing for a 
further  0.5m restructuring 
costs at our Point-of-Care (PoC) 
Division in Oslo, necessitated 
by the continued reshaping 
of our workforce to reflect the 
skills required for Afinion  
menu expansion and marketing.
Despite challenges during 
2006, the Group significantly 
progressed its strategic 
objectives to establish a major 
new platform in point-of-care 
testing and to build a branded 
presence in volume clinical 
laboratory diagnostics for its 
proprietary markers. Over 
the year we increased both 
revenues and profitability, 
though without any substantial 
contribution yet from our 
flagship Afinion  Point-of-Care 
System (formally the AS100 
analyser), and only very 
limited sales of the first assays 
recently launched under our 
AxSYM
 
xtra programme 
with Abbott. This reflects the 
all-round strength of our 
business, which in 2006 was 
particularly evident in our 
Distribution Division through 
Medinor, which posted an 8.3% 
increase in sales over 2005. 
As previously announced, 
our Afinion  roll-out was 
delayed as a result of 
manufacturing scale-up issues. 
This system represents a major 
advance in simplicity and 
reliability for testing at the point 
of care, so we have been careful 
to ensure that this new and 
innovative product meets all our 
exacting performance criteria 
in the hands of customers.
This has necessitated stringent 
testing of all instruments before 
they are shipped to end-users. 
We believe that current 
build quality and software 
robustness will meet customer 
needs and look forward 
to increasing placements 
as customers recognise 
Afinion 's advantages 
over existing systems. 
06 I Axis-Shield Annual Report 2006 Our core competence remains 
the development of novel 
patentable diagnostic solutions 
in areas of clinical need, making 
use of our special skills in 
protein chemistry to devise 
more effective ways to measure 
technically challenging markers 
with high clinical utility. This has 
been particularly evidenced 
by Afinion , where we have 
identified the trend towards 
miniaturisation and point-of-
care testing and developed a 
system capable of detecting 
important markers with  
minimal manipulation.  
Our expertise in adapting 
assays to run on automated 
platforms encompassing  
many different technologies 
continues to be in demand.  
We have developed system  
menu extensions, including 
both novel and conventional 
markers, through OEM 
partnerships with the major 
global diagnostic companies 
that dominate the hospital 
laboratory marketplace. 
This is the basis of our 
relationship with Abbott 
Diagnostics, one of the world's 
leading IVD companies, 
for which we make tests to 
run on IMx
 
 and AxSYM
 
, 
two of Abbott's widely placed 
instrument platforms. A special 
contract to develop tests on 
the latter instrument enables 
us to market our own-labelled 
products, thus giving us a 
quick route to the automated 
instrument market for our 
proprietary markers at a higher 
kit price than conventional  
OEM arrangements, and 
without the substantial costs 
associated with developing 
our own sophisticated high 
throughput instrumentation.  
We are now also developing 
tests for Abbott's flagship 
high throughput ARCHITECT
 
 
analyser. The proposed 
acquisition of Abbott 
Diagnostics by GE Healthcare, 
announced in January 2007, 
and likely to be closed early in 
Q2 2007, is not expected to 
change our relationship with this 
major global IVD company and 
we look forward to increased 
opportunities for collaboration.
We have identified the 
rapidly expanding market 
for point-of-care testing, 
particularly in the doctors' 
office, as a sector not  
currently dominated by  
any large companies.  
We have therefore built on  
our existing presence in the  
market, established through 
our successful NycoCard  
system, by the development 
of our next generation PoC 
platform, the Afinion  AS100 
Analyser. We have successfully 
achieved regulatory marketing 
approval and Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments 
(CLIA) waiver from the US FDA 
for the system using the first 
test for HbA1c in monitoring 
treatment compliance in 
diabetes. CLIA waiver permits 
the use of the test and system 
by non-professional staff, 
acknowledging that waived 
tests are easy to use, accurate, 
reliable and very unlikely to 
produce incorrect results. 
This approval has facilitated 
marketing in the USA through 
our distribution partners Abbott 
and its partner Physician Sales 
and Service (PSS), which 
maintains a specialist doctors' 
office sales force. This will allow 
Afinion  to gain the highest 
possible exposure to this key 
segment of the US market. 
We also market diagnostic 
tests and medical devices to 
end-users in our home markets 
of the UK and the Nordic 
countries through Axis-Shield 
UK in Cambridgeshire and 
Medinor (with offices in Norway, 
Sweden, Finland and Denmark), 
and to the developing 
world through Plasmatec,  
our subsidiary based in 
Bridport, Dorset.

Afinion
TM
 has been 
extremely useful in our 
practice. It produces 
quick and accurate 
results and is very 
easy to use. We are 
using both the HbA1c 
test to monitor our 
diabetics and the CRP 
kit to assess whether 
a patient should be 
treated with antibiotics. 
The system was placed 
in a 5 GP group practice 
outside Oslo and has been 
in use for the last six months. FINANCIAL OVERVIEW
Revenues for 2006 were  
 60.8m, compared to  58.2m 
in 2005, an increase of 4.6%. 
Gross margins (53.4%) were 
slightly less than 2005 (53.9%),  
partly due to one-off 
revalidation costs connected 
with the regulatory requirements 
of one of our OEM partners, 
producing a gross profit 
of  32.5m (2005:  31.4m). 
Operating profit before R&D 
was  10.4m, compared to 
 10.6m in 2005. Operating 
expenses increased from 
 20.8m to  22.1m. These 
included some additional sales 
expenditure related to Afinion  
and particularly the expansion 
of our US base to meet 
demands associated with the 
ramp up of Afinion  in this key 
market. Total R&D spend, which 
includes the legal costs relating 
to patent litigation, was similar 
to 2005, at  8.4m compared 
to  8.7m and is expected to 
continue at this level in the 
current year.
Axis-Shield reported its second 
successive year of annual net 
operating profits, with a profit of 
 2.0m before tax (2005:  1.9m).  
The profit was after writing-off 
reorganisation costs in Norway 
of  0.5m (2005:  0.5m) and 
after share-based payments  
of  0.4m (2005:  0.3m). 
The recognition of a deferred 
tax asset of  6.5m, together 
with an actual tax charge of 
 0.1m, has produced a tax 
credit of  6.4m (2005: charge  
of  0.1m). This has resulted  
in a profit after tax of  8.4m 
(2005:  1.8m) and earnings  
per share of 17.3p (2005: 3.8p). 
After adjusting for the deferred 
tax asset credit, earnings  
per share were 3.9p.
The balance sheet remains 
strong with cash at the year 
end of  10.3m, compared to 
 11.5m at the end of 2005. 
Annual profits together with 
the recognition of the deferred 
tax asset have helped increase 
shareholders' funds from 
 39.1m to  46.6m.
Axis-Shield continues to 
generate a strong cash flow 
from its commercial operations, 
which allows it to fund a 
substantial R&D programme 
without repeated recourse to 
the capital markets.  
The businesses are 
demonstrating sustainable 
profitability and are expected to 
continue as the company reaps 
the benefits of its investment 
in both internal and external 
research and development.
BOARD CHANGES
In January 2007 we announced 
the promotion of Ian Gilham 
to the new position of Chief 
Operating Officer, to focus on 
business operations as new 
products are commercialised. 
Paul Garvey, who has been 
Finance Director since July 
2000, left at the end of March 
2007 to pursue other interests. 
Ronny Hermansen, Finance 
Director of our Oslo subsidiary 
Axis-Shield ASA, takes over as 
Group Finance Director with 
effect from 1 April 2007.
OUTLOOK 
We have sustained last year's 
maiden profitability during 2006 
despite some delays in our new 
product introductions. We are 
confident that as Afinion  is 
released into European and 
other markets, including the 
USA, this new system will make 
a substantial contribution to 
turnover going forward, though 
this will be evidenced only in 
the latter half of the year as 
the installed base grows and 
revenues are generated by 
reagent sales. Additionally  
the launch of the three  
AxSYM
 
 xtra markers, 
together with further markers 
in 2007 for both AxSYM
 
 and 
ARCHITECT
 
, should add 
further to sales growth and 
increase shareholder value. 
A continued increase in mainly 
sales and marketing overheads 
to facilitate this anticipated 
growth will be required during 
the first half of 2007. We also 
look forward to stabilisation of 
the homocysteine intellectual 
property landscape and 
the continued validation of 
the strength of our patent 
protection. Our positive cash 
flow and strong balance sheet 
will allow us to continue to invest 
in our R&D and operational 
capabilities and to identify 
commercial opportunities for 
expansion as new markers 
and technologies for in vitro 
diagnosis continue to be 
developed in what is seen as  
a vital area in the management 
of efficient healthcare services.
