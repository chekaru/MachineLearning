 It has been a momentous year in the
development and re-positioning of
Wilmington Group plc with significant
progress in achieving our strategic,
financial and structural goals. We have
delivered strong revenue and profit
growth from continuing operations, as
well as capital profits from the disposal of
assets. We have also invested in a range
of exciting initiatives for organic growth,
made further value-creating acquisitions
and, since the year end, completed the
restructuring and disposal of the Group's
portfolio of non-core businesses.
The Group's strategy is to concentrate
on the provision of information and
training to selected professional
business markets. We believe we 
can derive the best returns for our
shareholders by concentrating on major
professional markets and by focusing
investment in key niche sectors with the
capacity for strong and sustainable
growth.
During the year ended 30 June 2007,
we sold WDIS, the subscription and
circulation management bureau, for
 1m. This was our fourth significant
disposal as part of our strategic 
review of the Group's portfolio of 
non-core assets.
On 14 August 2007 we completed 
the fifth and largest disposal when we
sold Wilmington Media and Dewberry
Redpoint for a cash consideration of
 12m. Following this, Wilmington
Group is now firmly focused on niche
professional markets with strong
presence in the important sectors of
Law, Accountancy, Charities, Banking,
Pensions, Health, Journalism and PR.
We will report our results by reference
to the Legal and Regulatory businesses
and Business Information.
Financial Performance
The financial results for the year ended
30 June 2007 show significant progress
as measured by our key financial targets
of adjusted earnings per share, adjusted
profit before tax, cash flow and
underlying margins. 
Revenue from continuing operations in
the year grew by 23.8% to  81.5m
(2006:  65.8m). Profit from continuing
operations before tax, amortisation and
interest increased by 25.1% to  16.5m
(2006:  13.2m). The adjusted profit,
before non-recurring items, tax and
amortisation increased by 25.7%
to  15.2m (2006:  12.1m). Adjusted
profit from continuing and discontinued
operations increased by 20.9% to
 16.4m (2006:  13.6m). 
This is the fourth successive year of
impressive profit growth, which reflects
a significant improvement in the quality
of the Wilmington Group businesses
and underpins our confidence that 
we can create additional value for
shareholders.
Total earnings per share (from
continuing and discontinued
operations) increased by 43.2%
to 11.01p per share (2006: 7.69p).
Adjusted earnings per share
from continuing operations grew by
26.1% to 12.41p per share (2006:
9.84p), maintaining our recent trend 
of strong earnings per share growth.
The quality of the operating profits is
underpinned by strong cash flow.
Operating cash flow increased by 12.0%
to  19.0m (2006:  16.9m), representing
107% of operating profit (before non-
recurring costs, amortisation, interest
and taxation), reflecting a further
increase in underlying subscription
revenues. At 30 June 2007 the 
Group had net debt of  11.9m 
(2006:  13.1m). Since the year end 
the Group received  12m in respect of
the sale of Wilmington Media and
Dewberry Redpoint.
Share Buy Back
On 19 July 2007 the Group announced
that given the continued strength of
the Group's balance sheet reflecting the
strong cash flows of the Company, the
Board has assessed the capital required
to support the ongoing plans for
profitable growth and its ordinary
dividend payments, and has decided
that it will buy back initially up to  5m
of its ordinary shares by market value in
the coming months. It is intended that
the share buy-back programme will
start on 23 July and involve a rolling
share buy-back programme within the
limit approved by shareholders at the
Company's Annual General Meeting on
15 November 2006. It is intended that
any shares purchased will be transferred
into Treasury. 
Following the disposal of WDIS,
Wilmington Media and Dewberry
Redpoint the Board has decided to
extend the buy back from the initial
target of  5m to  12m of its ordinary
shares by market value. Whilst the Group
is determined to retain flexibility and the
ability to take advantage of the many
opportunities available to it, it is also
mindful of the benefits of an efficient
balance sheet and is committed to
achieving optimum efficiency, either 
by acquisition, or return of capital 
to shareholders.
Dividend
The Board remains committed to a
progressive dividend policy and
proposes a final dividend of
4p per share payable on the
12 November 2007 to shareholders 
on the register on 12 October 2007.
Taken together with the interim
dividend of 2p per share, this makes a
total dividend for the year of 6.0p per
share, an increase of 50% over the 4.0p
paid last year. The dividend is covered
2.1 times by adjusted earnings per
share from continuing operations
(2006: 2.5 times).
Highlights of the Year
Overall, we have achieved our ambition
of delivering substantial growth in
adjusted profit before tax and in adjusted
earnings per share. The Business Review
describes the performance of the
00100100102
02001001001001
Wilmington Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Chairman's Statement  business in greater detail. There are
however some sectoral highlights which 
I would like to identify in this statement.
Legal and Regulatory
Revenue has grown 25.6% to  65.3m
(2006:  52.0m), boosted by the
acquisition of Mercia Group Limited
(October 2006). Segmental profits
before central overheads and
amortisation have grown by 28.0% to 
a record  15.7m (2006:  12.3m). We
have seen excellent performances in
many areas of this division.
The previously recorded trend of
growing Internet and digital revenues
has continued. This has enhanced the
performance of all our publishing
businesses, with particular success
enjoyed by Pendragon (pensions) and
Smee & Ford (charities).
We have also seen very good growth
from our training businesses in the 
CLT Group. The acquisition of Mercia
Group in October 2006 has continued
our expansion into the accountancy
market. Training in law for non-lawyers
(Bond Solon) has had an excellent year.
Compliance training has also produced
a strong trading performance and at 
the end of the financial year we were
delighted to be asked to develop a
major programme of compliance
training and assessment for the
Singapore Government on behalf of the
International Compliance Association.
As we have previously highlighted, this
will necessitate significant investment
during the current financial year, but
will start to produce positive returns in
the next financial year and beyond.
These are exciting developments and,
despite our investment across the
division, we expect to see further
growth in both our Internet and digital
profits and the expansion of our training
activities during the current year.
Business Information
Following the successful disposal of 
our publishing interests in non core
businesses we have taken the
opportunity to reorganise our
healthcare and media entertainment
assets within the Wilmington Business
Information (WBI ) subsidiary of the
Group. This will now focus on these two
key sectors to develop both the organic
potential of the existing assets and
increase the size of our presence in
these markets through investment 
and acquisition when the right
opportunities arise.
This division includes Binley's, our UK
health information business, Agence de
Presse Medicale, the French language
health newswire service, and HPCi, our
health, pharmaceutical and cosmetic
publications. Our media assets 
include Hollis, which serves the
PR sector, Press Gazette in media and
journalism and Muze, which serves the
entertainment industry. 
I am delighted to report that both
revenues and profits from continuing
operations in Business Information have
shown strong growth in the year ended
30 June 2007. Revenue has grown
17.0% to  16.1m (2006:  13.8m).
Segmental profits before central
overheads and amortisation have grown
by 21.9% to  3.0m (2006:  2.4m).
Outlook
The Group is now focused on serving
the information and training
requirements of niche professional
markets. We believe that these markets
offer excellent opportunities for above
average growth over the longer term. 
We are investing in many organic
initiatives that we expect to produce
good returns in the current year and
beyond. Having shown we can acquire
quality assets at competitive prices, and
deliver synergies and growth from those
businesses acquired, we continue to
look for appropriate acquisitions to
complement our existing businesses.
The Board is very encouraged by
the continued improvement in the
underlying quality of the Group's
earnings and is confident of
demonstrating further progress in
the current year.
Finally, and as always, I would like to
thank my fellow Directors, Senior
Managers and all of the Group's
employees who have contributed to 
this year's successful results for their
innovation, hard work and commitment.
