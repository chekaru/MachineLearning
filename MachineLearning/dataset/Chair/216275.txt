Chairman's Statement
There are a number of positive indicators which
bode well for the future performance of Group.
In particular, booking levels in the legal training
market have stabilised and conditions in the
investment banking sector have improved. We
are also encouraged by the progress made with
the webinar programme (live online seminars)
which has gone from strength to strength,
producing significant growth in delegate
numbers. A number of businesses within the
Group, notably APIS, APM, Mercia, Pendragon
and CL T International (trusts and compliance),
have maintained good levels of revenue and
profit growth throughout the period,
demonstrating the strength of these assets and
the overall resilience of Wilmington's portfolio of
businesses. Operational efficiencies and cost
savings have also helped us to maintain profits
and margins during a challenging period.
I am pleased to report that Wilmington has
delivered a robust trading performance despite
an extremely tough year for the global economy. 
The first half of our financial year was impacted
severely by the economic downturn with
revenue from continuing operations down by
16% and Adjusted EBITA down by 21%
compared to the prior year. In the second half 
of the year we have seen trading conditions
easing with revenue down 2% and Adjusted
EBITA up 20% compared to the prior year. 
We are confident that there are many exciting
opportunities for growth available to the Group.
Change, particularly new legislation or regulation,
usually drives information and training
requirements in the professional markets we
serve. We have therefore increased the level of
revenue investment in our businesses to achieve
organic growth. 
  In collaboration with the University of the West
of England, we have launched a flexible Legal
Practice Course, an innovative approach to
studying for busy professionals. 
  We have harnessed new technology with the
success of the Legal Online Webinar training
programmes, providing interactive and dynamic
training to users' desktops. This technology is
being extended across the Group and is being
adopted by other Group businesses. 
  Within our Publishing & Information Division
we have seen the ongoing development of our
online databases and information services along
with the launch of new ones such as Charity
Financials which provides detailed financial
information on all 169,000 UK charities along with
powerful analytical tools for organisations looking
for intelligence on the UK charities sector.

Financial Performance
The financial results for the year ended 30 June
2010 show that prompt action at the onset of
the economic downturn protected profits and
margins. Whilst revenue from continuing
operations for the year ended 30 June 2010
declined by 9.1% to  78.4m (2009:  86.3m),
Adjusted EBITA decreased by less than 1.4% 
to  14.4m (2009:  14.6m). 
Adjusted Profit before Tax declined by 1.5% to
 13.1m (2009:  13.3m). Profit before Tax has
increased by 157 .2% to  7 .3m (2009:  2.9m),
reflecting the non-recurrence of any impairment
charges, reduced charges for non-recurring
items and the unwinding of the discount on the
provision for the future purchase of minority
interests. 
Adjusted Earnings per Share increased by 0.9%
to 10.59p per share (2009: 10.50p). Basic
Earnings per Share, which is after non-recurring
items, share based payments, the unwinding of
the discount on the provision for the future
purchase of minority interests, amortisation and
impairment increased to 5.38p (2009: 0.46p). 
The quality of the operating profits continues to
be underpinned by good cash flow. Operating
cash flow was  15.4m (2009:   13.9m),
representing 110% of operating profit (before
taxation, amortisation and impairment and
interest) (2009: 108%). 
Wilmington has delivered a robust trading
performance despite an extremely tough year
for the global economy. 
A number of businesses within the Group have
maintained good levels of revenue and profit
growth throughout the period, demonstrating
the strength of these assets and the overall
resilience of Wilmington's portfolio of
businesses.

Chairman's Statement
We are actively seeking acquisitions which
complement our strategic goals and where we
believe we can create value. In uncertain
markets we are particularly careful to ensure
that any investment we make is sustainable over
the long term and will further our goal of long
term profit growth. We believe that the
environment for growth by acquisition is
improving following some difficult years and we
are confident that we will make progress in the
current financial year. 
Dividend
The Board is recommending that the dividend
for the year is maintained at the same level as
the prior year. In our Interim Management
Report for the six months ended 31 December
2009 we announced the intention to move to an
equal dividend distribution weighted throughout
the year. The Board proposes a final dividend of
3.5 pence per share payable on 12 November
2010 to shareholders on the register on 
15 October 2010. Taken together with the
interim dividend of 3.5 pence per share, this
makes a total dividend for the year of 7 .0 pence
per share (2009: 7 .0 pence per share). The
dividend is covered 1.5 times by Adjusted
Earnings per Share from continuing operations. 
At 30 June 2010 the net assets of the Group
were  51.6m, (2009:  53.8m), with deferred
revenue increasing to  14.2m (2009:  13.9m). 
Wilmington has a strong balance sheet. The
Group has reduced its net debt despite
spending  2.2m to acquire additional minority
shareholdings in two existing subsidiaries and
paying an increased interim dividend of  2.9m
to achieve a smoother dividend distribution
throughout the year. At 30 June 2010 the
Group had net debt of  16.8m (2009:  17 .8m),
representing 28% utilisation of our  60m
facilities which are committed to March 2012.
Our ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA (see
Note 3) was 1.1 times at the year end.
Acquisitions and Disposals
During the financial year ended 30 June 2010,
no new acquisitions were made, although we
acquired additional shareholdings of two
existing subsidiaries. 
In July 2009 we acquired the remaining 15%
shareholding of Ark Group Limited. This
business has been restructured with its training
activities transferred to our Training & Events
Division and its publishing activities integrated
into our Publishing & Information Division.
In November 2009 we acquired an additional
5% shareholding of Beechwood House
Publishing Limited, taking our shareholding to
85% of the company.
Outlook
Whilst the economic outlook remains uncertain
and markets are unpredictable, the Group's
businesses have proved resilient and delivered a
robust trading performance despite the
economic downturn. We remain vigilant to the
impact of changing economic conditions, but as
a result of prompt action taken to reduce costs
in the prior financial year, and an ongoing focus
on efficiency, the Group is in a stronger position
than it was this time last year. There is uncertainty
surrounding the extent of Government spending
cuts for those businesses with exposure to the
UK public sector. However with positive
indications that trading conditions are easing or
stabilising in those markets that have been most
impacted by the economic downturn, we remain
optimistic about the Group's prospects. 
We are committed to our strategy of delivering
information and training to professional business
markets and continue to believe that these
markets will provide a good environment for
medium and long term growth. As announced in
our Interim Management Statement in May
2010, we believe that the time is now right to
invest in overseas expansion in the banking and
finance sector and in new product development,
particularly with regard to deeper content and
enhanced technology. We expect to invest up to
 2m and to see returns in the financial year
ending June 2012 and beyond.

I would like to thank my fellow Directors, Senior
Managers and all of the Group's employees who
have contributed to this year's results for their
hard work, enthusiasm and commitment. I would
particularly like to thank Rory Conwell, one of
the founding directors of Wilmington and a
former Chief Executive, who will be retiring from
the Group and who will step down from the
Board on 30 September 2010. Rory has made a
substantial contribution to the development and
growth of Wilmington. I wish him the very best
for the future.
