 2002 has been a difficult year for the Group and I am
pleased that we have responded both positively and in a
timely way to the challenges presented. 
The year commenced with uncertainties in all
economies, which in some cases turned into downturns
as the year progressed.  The private sectors have been
particularly affected however this has been partially off-
set by strong underlying growth in the public transport
infrastructure sector where we have won a number of
substantial long term contracts. 
I am pleased that our actual per-
formance for 2002 confirms our
December Trading Statement, and
to report a significant improvement
in our net debt position, reflecting
improved cash management and
collection.
Since the end of 2002 our long
term order book has grown by
20% principally through long term
transportation framework awards
confirming our position as one of
the leading consultants in this area
where the Government in the UK
and Sweden are committed to sig-
nificant expenditure over the next
five years.
After ten years of growth last
year saw a change in this momen-
tum, which required early manage-
ment recognition and action.  This
action resulted in exceptional costs
for 2002 in respect of selected
property and staff reductions, both
in the private sector businesses and
importantly in our Group central
support costs.  All these changes
ensure our resources are better
aligned to the markets and our
needs whilst ensuring we do not
prejudice our client relationships.
We have now successfully com-
pleted this restructuring to ensure
we can flexibly address the current
economic and market changes.
The diverse sector work base of
the Group worldwide has served
us well to maintain our turnover
and order book and to present us
with the opportunity to pursue
increased work in the busier public
sectors, where we already have an
increased presence.  The move-
ment in our sector income profile
last year confirms this strategic
resilience and I expect this trend to
continue.  Whilst the increasingly
diverse geographical base has
proved less resilient due to a global
downturn, the platform remains a
sound base for the ongoing busi-
ness as economies progressively
improve.
Financial Results and Dividends
Turnover for the year increased to
 261.5 million (2001:  224.7 mil-
lion), representing a 16% increase
on the previous year principally
through consolidating a full year's
contribution from our Scandinavian
subsidiaries acquired during 2001.
Operating profit, before exception-
al items and amortisation of good-
will, fell to  14.5 million (2001:
 17.5 million).
We have concentrated on
improving our working capital
management and this has helped
to reduce net debt to  45.6 million
(2001:  50.6 million) at the year
end, well within our overall bank-
ing facilities, with net interest cov-
ered 4.7 times by profit before
exceptional items and amortisation
of goodwill. I expect this improve-
ment to continue in 2003 notwith-
standing the cash payment of
approximately  4.7m to be paid in
the first half of the year represent-
ing the deferred cash consideration
in respect of the acquisition of
Flack + Kurtz.
In view of the underlying per-
formance and the confidence of
the Board going forward, the
Directors propose to maintain the
dividend at 2001 levels, with a final
dividend of 3.0p (2001: 3.0p)
which, together with the interim
dividend of 2.0p (2001: 2.0p), gives a
total for the year of 5.0p (2001:5.0p).
Approximately 10% of the
Group's workforce is in defined
benefit pension schemes and at the

end of the year the net pension
deficit, calculated under FRS 17,
amounted to  13.5million (2001:
 6.7 million). The Group has
already started to address this
shortfall by increasing both the
employer and employee contribu-
tions and is working to minimise
the exposure in the medium to
long term.
Review of Activities
The private property sector has
had a difficult year with the
economies in all our regions affect-
ing specific parts of our business
activities. Our turnover and profits
reflect these challenging markets.
We have seen a downturn in
the commercial, financial, corpo-
rate and leisure sectors whereas
health, education, retail and resi-
dential has held up rather better.
Overall our property division in
the UK and Sweden have under-
performed, whereas our businesses
in the United States have performed
in line with our expectation, in a
continuing difficult market.
Transportation and infrastruc-
ture Services have performed well
in the stronger public sector gener-
ating 24% organic growth, which
we expect to continue.  In the UK
we have won a number of long
term contracts including the man-
agement of Area 12 for the High-
ways Agency, and two framework
agreements for Network Rail. In
Sweden similar awards arose
including a major new highway,
E6 and a tunnelling contract in
Stockholm city centre. 
Environmental Services contin-
ues to develop satisfactorily with
the integration of Sweden into the
global business and the promotion
of innovative products and servic-
es. Our Environmental group pro-
cures work from a wide client base
in all sectors and correspondingly
has had mixed fortunes during the
year. However, overall our turn-
over has increased and our margins
maintained, helped by our past
investment in new services. Of par-
ticular interest is the new Active
Transfer product designed to
encourage the active remediation
of contaminated land and, using
insurance products, remove future
potential liabilities from clients'
balance sheets.
I am pleased to report that our
order book has held up well,
which bodes well for the future.
At the year end we had a secure
long-term order book of  250 
million, with half of the 2003 
budgeted revenue already in hand.
In addition the year has started
well and we have been able to
reinforce the order book by a fur-
ther  50million with a number of
notable project wins.  Whilst cur-

rent economic uncertainties may
affect the draw down on the order
book, we have always been pru-
dent in our assessment of secured
work and I therefore believe that
we are strongly positioned for the
coming year and beyond.
The integration of our
Scandinavian businesses has pro-
gressed well in a similar market to
the UK, underpinned by the well
prepared communication strategy
for re-branding J&W to WSP
Sweden.  In Norway, our associat-
ed company Multiconsult has
delivered good results and benefit-
ed from a strong home economy
Asia remains difficult with our
ongoing focus increasingly on
China where we are currently pro-
gressing our full business registra-
tion.  We have restructured the
senior management in WSP Asia
to better focus the company going
forward and this region remains a
strategic part of our ongoing busi-
ness and we expect cautious
improvements in its performance.
Our businesses in South Africa
have performed well in reasonable
markets and will, I believe, improve
in the future.
Staff
I am very grateful for the efforts of
all our staff who have continued to
show such commitment and ener-
gy in the face of market conditions
which have clearly been more diffi-
cult than most have experienced in
recent years.
Directors 
I am pleased to report that
Christopher Stephens was appoint-
ed a non-executive director of
WSP in January 2003. Chris brings
to the Group a wealth of knowl-
edge in human resources and gen-
eral management and I am sure he
will contribute significantly to the
future development of WSP.  Chris
becomes the third independent
non-executive director, all of whom
make up the audit, remuneration
and nomination committees. 
Future
The outlook for the markets in
which we work is varied.  I expect
the commercial and financial areas
of the private sector to remain
quiet, whilst areas such as health,
education, residential and traffic
planning will be maintained.  In
contrast, I anticipate all the trans-
portation and infrastructure mar-
kets to remain strong and present
us with opportunities to further
develop these businesses.  As our
environmental business matures I
expect the Group to benefit from
the investment we have made in
new and innovative products and
services.
Our diversification strategy, giv-
ing the Group a broad regional,
sector and skill base has served us
well going forward and ensures we
are very well placed to benefit as
and when economies and markets
improve.
The restructuring of parts of
the Group will ensure a more
appropriate cost base for the pre-
vailing market conditions, thus
enabling us to deliver a more effec-
tive operation.  We are very
focused on continuing to improve
our core values through excellent
client service, new staff opportuni-
ties and improved production effi-
ciency all of which will lead to
improved shareholder value.
With the steps we have taken
to stabilise the Group following
the changes in 2002 and our strong
order book I believe we are now
better placed to perform pre-
dictably and the Board continues
to believe that profits will increase
in the current year.
