Overview
Iam verypleased to reportona successful year for 
theGroup.
In the year to 31October 2007, wecompletedboth the
lastphaseofour previousbuy andbuildcycleandembarked
onanew oneand so the year may be viewedas oneof
transitionfromonephase toanother.
Following thedisposalofMatrix Communications and
completionof theassociatedearnout withits acquirer 
Calyx Groupplc, we returned  10.3m to shareholders.
SinceFebruary theBoardhas beenimplementingabuy and
build strategy toacquireandbuild scaleanddepthin the
managed services and storage sectorsof theIT services
market.Todate theGrouphas madefour acquisitions as 
set outbelow.
Consideration
Month Company Cash Deferred Maximum
February Posetiv Limited  4.2m-  4.2m
April Anix Holdings Limited  11m -  11m
October RedSquaredplc  3.2m-  3.2m
October ItheonLimited  3.6m  3.2m  6.8m
Since theseacquisitions weremade,Posetiv,Anix and
RedSquared,allbusinesses that arefocussedonmanaged
services and storage,havebeenconsolidated under theAnix
brand.Successfulconsolidationof thesebusinesses in the
secondhalfof the year has given theGroupa very strong
customer base with significant recurring revenues.Itheon
remains as a standalonebusinessfocusedon the supply of
networkassurance software.Anix is bothacustomer and
channel tomarket for Itheon's innovative software.
TheGroupexpects operationalandother synergies from
theacquisitionofRedSquaredandItheon tobe realised
over thecourseof thenext year.Thefullbenefits of the
acquisitions willonly beapparent as thecurrent year unfolds.
Results
Our results have tobeconsideredin thecontextof strategic
transition.Revenues for the year to 31October 2007 were
 31.2m(2006:  29.5m)and we recordedanoperatingloss
of  0.9m(2006:loss  7.5m)anadjustedoperatingprofit 
of  1.2m(2006:loss  4.3m),andalossper shareof(1.4p)
(2006:profit 26.2p).
Comparingour results for 2007 with thoseof 2006 
is complicatedby thefollowingfactors:
 The 2006 results comprised theEquipdistribution
businessfor threemonths, theIntegrationdivisionfor
sevenandahalfmonths andFujinTechnology Trading
for twelvemonths.
 The 2007 figures reportedhereinincludeFujinTechnology
Tradingfor tenmonths up toits disposal,Posetiv Limited
for ninemonths,Anix Groupfor sevenmonths and
RedSquaredPlcandItheonLimitedfor two weeks 
eachfollowing their respectiveacquisitions.
 InNovember 2006 we returned 26pper share
to shareholders.
As a result of theacquisitions and thedisposalofFujin,
theGroupnow has two tradingbrands,Anix andItheon.
Anix
Anix now comprises twodivisions encompassingmanaged
services and the resaleof softwareandhardwarefor data
storage solutions.Anix is oneoffour Platinumpartners to
IBMandoneof twoPlatinumpartners toNetApp.It is also
aMicrosoft Goldpartner andholds many other vendor
accreditations.This is inline withour strategy ofbuilding
strong relationships withbest ofbreed vendors.
Through the successfulconsolidationofAnix andPosetiv
and theacquisitionofRedSquared,Anix is now positioned
as oneof theUK's strongest midmarket managed services
specialists,Itheonowns the software required todeliver
these services creatingfurther opportunities for theGroup.
Ovumpredicts that this market willbe worth$41.5Bnby
2009and that thefastestgrowing regionin the world
is Europe,MiddleEastandAfrica(EMEA).
When takenover thelast twelvemonths ofour acquired
companies' trading, themanaged services billinggrew at an
annualised rateof40% year on year withnew totalcontract
margin signings growingby 51% through thefocuson the
midmarket.Weareexpecting similar growth this year.
Since1November 2007 Anix has signedor is negotiating
contracts with totalcontract values inexcess of  10m. Anix now owns twodatacentres witha totalcapacityfor
100 racks of which50%is currently occupied.Further space
is sublet fromnational suppliers.TheGrouphas chosen
tofocusonhigher valuemanaged services rather than
simplelow marginco-locationor server hotelactivities.
Themarket has seenmuchactivityin this area recently 
with the successfulpublicofferingofTelecityand the
acquisitionofIXEuropeby Equinix.This areaof thebusiness
typically generates higher margins than the server hotel
activity.TheGroupcurrently services approximately 220
customersacross twonetworkoperatingcentres inBristol
andManchester andexpects tobuildout theseoperations 
as thecustomer basegrows.
Hardware sales ofAnix remains important to theGroup;
wereit not for this sideof thebusiness we wouldnot enjoy
thebenefits of top tier vendor relationships andaccreditations.
However,by its verynature this sourceof revenueis harder
topredict.Anix saw some softeningin this areain 2007 but
early costandoperationalcontrolhas meant that this side
of thebusiness willcontinue todeliver strong results for the
Group.Indeed toward theendof the year theGroup was
delighted to reportalargecontract withCamelot worth
some  5m,of which  4mhas been recognisedin the
current year.
Itheon
TheGroup was delighted tocomplete theacquisitionof
Itheon.This modular based softwareenables us to replicate
anIBMTivoli  or HPOpenview  styleofmonitoringand
reportingfor our services customers.Traditionally,Itheon
has soldits software through thirdparties andit will
continue todo so usingAnix as bothafurther channel
tomarket andacustomer.Unlike the softwarefrom the
larger vendors,Itheon's softwareis idealfor our mid
market focusbothin terms ofcostand scalability.
Rather thanintegrate this business under theAnix brand
theGrouphas decided tocontinue to tradeas Itheonin
order toprotect the thirdparty revenues that already exist.
Indeed,given the traditionally highmargins enjoyedby
softwarebusinesses,it is our aim to tryandextend the
offeringacrossEuropeMiddleEastandAfrica with a
positiveimpact on revenues andprofitability.
Aparticularly excitingelement of theItheon softwareis 
theability toprovide storageallocation tracking.In simple
terms this means thecustomer canmeasureandbill the use
of storageat a verygranular level viaanautomatedprocess.
This has already been successfully deployedin theUK with
NHSelectronicpatient records.Havingproved themodel
theGroupis now going tohost this aspect of the software
and turn theprovisionof this intoSoftwareas aService
( Saas').This willenablecustomers to simply loginandpull
down this serviceona subscriptionbasis andmeans wecan
launchit globally.Gartner reports that by 2011 25%ofall
software sold willbe viaSaaSand willhaveaglobal value
of$19.3bn.
FujinTechnology
InSeptember 2007, theGroupdisposedofFujinTechnology
TradingLimited.Having undertakena strategic review of
this business, theBoarddecided that Fujin's mobile we b
content filteringplatform was nolonger core to theGroup's
activities.Thebusiness was sold toFujin's management 
for acashconsiderationof  1.0 million realisingaprofit on
saleof  437,000.Under the terms of this agreement Xploite
retained the rights toFujin's patentedinnovativecontent
filteringandcategorisation software, thereby protectingany
future value that might arisefromits investment todate.
Board
During the year wemadeanumber of significant Board
changes.TheGroup welcomedbackTony Weaver who
rejoined theBoardinFebruary 2007 as ChiefOperating
Officer.Tony was previously theCOOofMatrix
Communications andhadleft only tofacilitate the
successfulearnoutandintegrationof that business with
its acquirer Calyx Groupplc.RobertArrowsmithjoined
as FinanceDirector andbrought withhimmany years
experienceofmergersandacquisitions withinIT services.
Ijoined theBoardinAprilas Non-ExecutiveChairman
andI was joinedinJuly by RichardRamsay whois our
independent senior Non-executivedirector.Iconsider 
that the skills of theBoardare very well suited to the
strategicgoals of theGroup.

Current tradingandoutlook
Our tradingis encouragingand weareconfident that our

Currently less than10%ofmidmarket customersoutsource
any or allof their IT- this is our opportunity.This market is
growing strongly at some40%annually amongstFTSE 250
customersandit is our aim tobe theUK's number one
supplier to this market.
Weannouncedon11December 2007, that discussions were
takingplace whichmay or may not lead toanoffer for all
or partof theCompany.Thesediscussions areongoingand
thereis nocertainty that they will result inaformaloffer.
We willmakeafurther announcement as appropriate.
