I present the results of the Group for the year ended 30 September 2010.   
Zest Group Plc ( Zest  or the Company ) announced on 12 November 2010 that it was proposing to change its 
name and adopt a new Investing Policy (Proposed Investing Policy ). A Circular to Shareholders setting out details 
of a proposed change in its Investing Policy and proposed Name Change was sent to all company shareholders. 
The General Meeting (GM ) is to be held on 29 November 2010 to adopt the Proposed Investing Policy, as set out 
below, and change the Company's name to Rare Earth Minerals Plc. 
Background 
The Company was formed to build a music business by acquiring new artists together with their music publishing 
rights and acquiring recording and publishing companies. The Company has made progress in developing its 
business objectives as set out in its Admission Document. However, in the six months to 31 March 2010 the 
Company reported a loss before taxation of  194,000 and further reported that it was reliant on external funding. 
The Directors have therefore come to the conclusion that whilst Zest's existing business may be able to deliver some 
value (and will be retained) it does not form the basis of a sustainable business for a publicly traded company. 
Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is in the Company's interests to adopt a new strategy for the development 
of the Company as an investing company and to take advantage of opportunities outside of the music industry and 
also draw on the experience and success of Mr Lenigas in the natural resources sector as a means of establishing 
greater shareholder value, further details of which are set out below.  
As an investing company, Zest will be required to make an acquisition or acquisitions which constitute a reverse 
takeover under the AIM Rules or otherwise implement its Proposed Investing Policy on or before the date falling 
twelve months from the adoption of the Proposed Investing Policy, failing which, the Company's Ordinary Shares 
would then be suspended from trading on AIM. In the event the Company's Ordinary Shares are so suspended and 
the Company fails to obtain Shareholders' consent to renew such policy, the admission to trading on AIM of the 
Ordinary Shares would be cancelled six months from the date of suspension and the Directors will convene a 
general meeting of the Shareholders to consider whether to continue seeking investment opportunities or to wind up 
the Company and distribute any surplus cash back to Shareholders. In making the assessment of whether or not an 
investing company has substantially implemented its investing policy, this is normally considered to mean that the 
investing company has invested a substantial portion (usually at least in excess of 50 per cent.) of all funds available 
to it , including funds available through agreed debt facilities, in accordance with its investing policy. 
Proposed Investing Policy  
The Company's proposed change in strategy and Proposed Investing Policy, which is subject to shareholder 
approval, is to acquire a diverse portfolio of direct and indirect interests in exploration and producing Rare Earth 
Minerals and/or Metals projects and assets. In light of the nature of the assets and projects which will be the focus of 
the Proposed Investing Policy, the Company will consider investment opportunities anywhere in the world. 
The Directors have considerable experience investing, both in structuring and executing deals and in raising funds. 
Further details of the Directors' expertise are set out below. The Directors will use this experience to identify and 
investigate investment opportunities, and to negotiate acquisitions. Wherever necessary the Company will engage 
suitably qualified technical personnel to carry out specialist due diligence prior to making an acquisition or an 
investment. For the acquisitions which they expect the Company to make, the Directors may adopt earn-out 
structures, with specific performance targets being set for the sellers of the businesses acquired, and with suitable 
metrics applied.  
The Company may invest by way of outright acquisition or by the acquisition of assets, including the intellectual 
property, of a relevant business, partnerships or joint venture arrangements. Such investments may result in the  ZEST GROUP PLC

Company acquiring the whole or part of a company or project (which in the case of an investment in a company 
may be private or listed on a stock exchange, and which may be pre-revenue), and such investments may constitute 
a minority stake in the company or project in question. The Company's investments may take the form of equity, 
joint venture, debt, convertible instruments, licence rights, or other financial instruments as the Directors deem 
appropriate.  
The Company may be both an active and a passive investor depending on the nature of the individual investments in 
its portfolio. Although the Company intends to be a long-term investor, the Directors will place no minimum or 
maximum limit on the length of time that any investment may be held.  
There is no limit on the number of projects into which the Company may invest, nor the proportion of the 
Company's gross assets that any investment may represent at any time and the Company will consider possible 
opportunities anywhere in the world.  
The Directors may offer new Ordinary Shares by way of consideration as well as cash, thereby helping to preserve 
the Company's cash for working capital and as a reserve against unforeseen contingencies including by way of 
example, and without limit, delays in collecting accounts receivable, unexpected changes in the economic 
environment and unforeseen operational problems. The Company may in appropriate circumstances, issue debt 
securities or otherwise borrow money to complete an investment. There are no borrowing limits in the Articles. The 
Directors do not intend to acquire any cross-holdings in other corporate entities that have an interest in the Ordinary 
Shares.  
There are no restrictions in the type of investment that the Company might make nor on the type of opportunity that 
may be considered other than set out above.  
As the Ordinary Shares are traded on AIM this provides a facility for Shareholders to realise their investment in the 
Company. The attention of Shareholders is drawn to Risk Factors  set out below. In addition, the Directors may 
consider from time to time other means of facilitating returns to Shareholders including dividends, share 
repurchases, demergers, and schemes of arrangements or liquidation.  
The Company will provide an update on its investing activities at the same time that it publishes its audited annual 
results for the year ending 30 September 2011 and as otherwise required by the AIM Rules. The Company has no 
current plans to publish any regular estimate of net asset value or updates on the investments.  
Name Change 
In accordance with article 104 of the Articles, the Directors have passed a resolution to change the name of the 
Company to Rare Earth Minerals Plc conditional upon the passing of the Resolution by the Shareholders to adopt 
the Proposed Investing Policy. 
Subject to the change of name of the Company becoming effective, the new website address of the Company will be 
www.rareearthmineralsplc.com. 
Risk Factors  
Any investment by the Company as part of the Proposed Investing Policy will carry a high degree of risk. These 
risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing the Company and additional risks and uncertainties not presently 
known or which are currently deemed immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on the Company's 
business, results of operations or financial condition.   ZEST GROUP PLC

If any or a combination of the risks materialise, the Company's business, financial condition, operational 
performance and share price could be materially and adversely affected to the detriment of the Company and the 
Shareholders. 
GM Business  
The business to be considered at the GM is as follows:  
Adoption of the Proposed Investing Policy - to be proposed as an Ordinary Resolution  
We are asking Shareholders to approve and adopt the Proposed Investing Policy. In particular, the Company is 
seeking the authority of Shareholders to acquire direct and indirect interests in exploration, development and 
producing Rare Earth Minerals and/or Metals projects and assets. In light of the nature of the assets and projects 
which will be the focus of the Proposed Investing Policy the Company will consider investment opportunities 
anywhere in the world. The intention is to acquire a widely distributed mix of Rare Earth Minerals and Metals 
development and producing assets.  
If the Resolution is passed and the Proposed Investing Policy is adopted, the name of the Company will change to 
Rare Earth Minerals Plc. 
FINANCIAL RESULTS  
The Group's loss for the year is  284,000 (2009:  283,000). 
OUTLOOK 
The Board considers that the Resolution for the adoption of the Proposed Investing Policy is in the best interests of 
the Company and its Shareholders as a whole. The Board will be voting in favour of the Resolution and they 
unanimously recommend that Shareholders should vote in favour of it as well. 
The Board acknowledges this exciting period for the Company as it proceeds to change its investment strategy this 
year and commence evaluating new investment opportunities as they arise. 
The Directors would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders for their continued support.
