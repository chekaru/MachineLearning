 The Board is continually 
looking at other acquisitions 
which have a synergistic  
fit with the business, leading to 
increased shareholder value.
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to report that the financial year ended  
31 March 2006 has been a successful one for the group  
as it celebrates 20 years in the diagnostics industry. 
Introduction and overview 
Following the flotation of the group on AIM in the last 
financial year, the company has built on this success and 
entered into a number of agreements and transactions with 
third parties to enhance shareholder value. As mentioned 
in my report last year, two significant transactions took 
place during the 2005/06 financial year.
On 22 June 2005, the group entered into an agreement  
with Inverness Medical Innovations (IMI) whereby, in return 
for IMI granting freedom to operate rights under their patent 
portfolio, IMI has a five-year option to purchase 25% of  
the ordinary shares of the company, in issue at the time  
of entering into the agreement at a price of  1 per  
ordinary share. 
During the year, the group invested  293,000 in Quotient 
Diagnostics Limited in the form of convertible loan stock 
which, if converted, entitles the group to 12.35% of the share 
capital of the company. On 20 July 2006 the group also 
exercised an option to purchase a further 10% of the share 
capital at an exercise price of  410,000.
In addition to the two agreements mentioned above,  
on 27 March 2006 the group signed an exclusive 
manufacturing agreement with US-based Verax  
Biomedical Limited. Under the terms of this agreement,  
BBI will manufacture Verax's PGD Platelet test for the  
global marketplace. 
Results
Turnover for 2006 increased 37% to  6.35 million  
(2005:  4.63 million); this has primarily been as a result of 
a 219% growth in revenue of the diabetes support product 
GlucoGel (formerly HypoStop). In addition, revenues from 
gold colloid and conjugate manufacture have risen by 
just over 25%. The gross profit increased 53% to  3.9 million 
(2005:  2.54 million) and the gross profit percentage 
increased from 55% in 2005 to 61% as a result of a greater 
proportion of sales being attributable to high margin 
products such as GlucoGel and gold colloid sales.
The earnings before interest, tax and amortisation increased 
87% to  1.46 million (operating profit of  1.18 million plus 
goodwill amortisation of  0.28 million) (2005:  0.78 million 
- operating profit of  0.54 million plus goodwill amortisation 
of  0.24 million), with the overall operating profit increasing 
117% to  1.2 million (2005:  0.55 million).
Overall, there was a profit after tax for the year of  
 0.81 million (2005:  0.09 million) which resulted in 
earnings per share of 3.7p (2005: earnings per share of 
0.1p). These results are expected to continue to improve in 
the coming year as we see further growth in the business.
The group has net assets of  7.20 million  
(2005:  5.49 million), with cash at bank of  
 1.45 million (2005:  1.14 million made up of cash at  
bank of  0.44 million and current asset investments of  
 0.70 million on one month treasury deposit with our bank).
Post balance sheet events
On 18 April 2006, the group agreed to acquire Alchemy 
Laboratories Ltd ( Alchemy'), a Dundee-based rapid 
result diagnostic test company, for  4.5 million in cash 
and shares. This acquisition will help expand BBI's 
service portfolio and provide capacity to take on new 
manufacturing contracts.
Following the acquisition, I am pleased to welcome Richard 
Lamotte, Managing Director of Alchemy, to the Board of BBI. 
He has over 20 years' experience in the diagnostics industry 
and will be responsible for the Alchemy business unit.
 
The group raised  3.0 million before expenses ( 2.7m net) 
through a placing of new ordinary shares with  2.2 million 
to be used to satisfy the cash element of the consideration 
and  500,000 to provide additional working capital for  
the group.
 
On 4 July 2006, the group acquired 100% of the issued 
share capital of both Audiometrics Ltd and CDx Ltd for 
an initial consideration of  200,000 in cash plus ongoing 
royalties and milestone based payments. These companies 
distribute a talking blood glucose meter reader for the 
visually impaired, called SensoCard Plus. The acquisition 
gives BBI exclusive distribution rights for the product within 
the UK and shared rights for the USA, Canada and India.
On 19 July 2006, the group acquired 100% of the issued 
share capital of Qnostics Limited, a molecular quality 
control production company based in Glasgow, for a 
consideration of  522,500 in cash and shares.

capital of Quotient Diagnostics Limited at an exercise price

Overview and prospects
In order to manage the group more effectively and 
maximise returns to stakeholders, the Board has split the 
group into three operating divisions: 
    BBI Healthcare - specialising in the sale and distribution 
of diabetes and healthcare related products, which will 
be responsible for GlucoGel.
    BBI - specialising in gold colloid sales, rapid test contract 
development and the development of the group's own 
intellectual property.
    Alchemy - specialising in manufacturing and some 
rapid test development where applicable.
The Group has also set up a US subsidiary, BBI Research Inc, 
to work on contract development and assist further growth 
in our largest market, which has resulted in the group 
winning a tender with a value of $160,000.
With the new corporate structure and the significant 
acquisitions and agreements that have been made, the  
BBI group is well placed to compete successfully in the 
rapid test Point of Care diagnostics market. The acquisitions 
that have been made have further diversified BBI's revenue 
streams, lessening the dependence on current key clients 
and individual geographic locations.
The Board is continuing to invest in research and 
development to further enhance its intellectual property 
and is continually looking for other acquisitions which  
have a synergistic fit with the business, leading to increased 
shareholder value. 
The share price has continued to strengthen in comparison 
with the prior year with a low of 78.5p in May 2005 and  
a high of 100p in January 2006, ending at 95.5p on  
31 March 2006.
The continued support of our investors, customers, and 
suppliers is much appreciated. The Board recognises that 
the progress made over this period would not have been 
possible without the dedication and determination of all  
our staff and, on behalf of the Board, I offer our warmest 
thanks to them.
