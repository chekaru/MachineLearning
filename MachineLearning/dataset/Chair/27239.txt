 The increased turnover from the
Bio-decontamination division
was seen across a broad range 
of sectors and territories
Overview
The BIOQUELL Group comprises two divisions:
Bio-decontamination and TRAC - Testing, Regulatory
and Compliance - which includes Cape and the new
service businesses, TRL Compliance and KTL, acquired
in October 2005.
Results and finance
Turnover for the Group increased by 47% to  25.2 million
(2005:  17.2 million). Excluding the two businesses
acquired in October 2005, the Group's revenues showed
organic growth of 19%. The Bio-decontamination
division's revenues in 2006 were  14.6 million
(2005:  11.5 million), representing organic growth of
27%. The TRAC division's revenues were  10.6 million
(2005:  5.7 million), representing growth of 86%; growth
excluding the effect of acquisitions was 4%. The Group's
revenues outside the UK increased by 75% from  4 million
to  7 million, largely reflecting increased US sales in the
bio-decontamination sector.
The increased turnover from the Bio-decontamination
division was seen across a broad range of sector and
territories, although growth in Clarus equipment and 
RBDS (Room Bio-Decontamination Service) revenues was
particularly strong in North America. Significant growth
was also seen in the Group's defence business which
supplies specialist CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological
and Nuclear) filtration and environmental control
equipment. Turnover in the Group's original laboratory
equipment and after-sales service businesses was basically
unchanged. The consolidated gross margin showed a
further increase of 2% to 39% reflecting the higher 
value equipment and service revenues.
Demand remained strong for the specialist testing,
regulatory and compliance services provided by businesses
within the TRAC division, particularly from clients in the
defence, aerospace and telecoms sectors. The integration
of the five separate testing businesses into one division is
proceeding well and we are already seeing tangible
commercial benefits from increased levels of sales from
across the enlarged division's client base. The TRAC
division's gross margin increased by two percentage points
to 38%, reflecting the higher margins generated by the
businesses acquired late in 2005.
Gross expenditure on product development in the year
was  1.0 million (2005:  1.2 million). This reflects the
continuing high levels of expenditure on new products,
such as the recently launched BIOQUELL Z, as well as new
wound healing technology which the Group is developing.
It also reflects the ongoing research we are undertaking in
the eradication of superbugs  from hospitals in the UK
and internationally.
Sales and marketing costs were unchanged at
approximately  3 million but these declined as a
proportion of Group revenues from 18% (2005) to 
12%, reflecting both cost cutting and the revenue effect
of acquisitions.
Profit before tax was  1.2 million (2005: loss before tax of
 0.5 million). The  1.7 million improvement in profitability
reflects a number of factors including the higher revenues
from both divisions, increased operational efficiencies
and gross margins across the Group, lower costs at 
the Andover facility following the reduction in costs
associated with the original laboratory equipment
business and a full year's contribution from the acquired
businesses in the TRAC division. The full profit effect of
the substantial increase in BIOQUELL's revenues from
the United States in 2006 was suppressed due to the
significant decline in the US dollar against sterling in
the second half.
The Group does not expect to incur a tax charge in the
year, principally due to the use of tax allowances relating
to capital expenditure and research and development
costs. The Group had approximately  4 million of deferred
UK tax assets at 31 December 2006.

at eradicating superbugs  from the
hospital environment and can significantly
reduce the patient infection rate of
superbug  Clostridium difficile
Earnings for the year were  1.2 million (2005: ( 0.3) million);
basic earnings per share were 2.9p (2005: (0.8p)).
The Group's net debt at 31 December 2006 was 
 0.6 million, some  1 million lower than at 30 June 2006
and 31 December 2005 when it had been  1.6 million.
This reduction in net debt shows the significant
improvement in cash generated by the Group's businesses,
notwithstanding substantial levels of ongoing research
and development and capital expenditure.
Capital expenditure was  1.5 million (2005:  1.2 million)
relating largely to investment in specialist testing and
move-related equipment for the TRAC division.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment was
 1.0 million (2005:  1.0 million); amortisation of
intangibles was  0.6 million (2005:  0.4 million).
Net cash from operating activities was  3.5 million
(2005:  1.7 million.) Cash inflow after expenditure on
product development and before capital investment 
was  2.5 million (2005:  0.5 million).
Net assets at 31 December 2006 were  11.5 million
(2005:  10.1 million); gearing was 5% (2005: 16%).
Bio-decontamination division
The Bio-decontamination division had a good year in
2006 and has entered 2007 with order momentum
and new products. The new technology products -
particularly the Group's hydrogen peroxide vapour
bio-decontamination technology - performed well
showing, as noted above, strong revenue growth in the
UK and overseas. We continue to see further opportunities
and applications for BIOQUELL's bio-decontamination
technology in a range of sectors. Although we are firmly
of the view that a substantial opportunity for this
technology relates to healthcare applications - particularly
the eradication of superbugs  - we are also pleased by
the increasing revenues being generated from other
sectors such as pharmaceutical, bio-technology, research,
food and universities.

70030 PRE 1  30/3/07  16:50  Page 3 The TRAC division also performed
well in 2006 with strong increases 
in turnover and profitability from 
the businesses acquired in late 2005
The superbug  opportunity remains both a large
opportunity and a source of frustration. We continue to
find, as a general rule, that most hospitals move slowly in
terms of adopting new technology and the scale of the
superbug  problem is, in some senses, overwhelming 
as it affects so many different aspects of a hospital's
operations. Moreover, hospitals are generally extremely
reluctant to admit to having a superbug  problem due 
to, among other things, the associated liability and public
relations issues. However, we typically find that once
hospitals have experienced BIOQUELL's technology in 
a stressful outbreak situation we tend to secure repeat
business and client referrals. We are seeing increasing
levels of interest in BIOQUELL's technology from
healthcare providers in a number of countries and are
in discussions with several hospitals relating to the
deployment of a BIOQUELL implant  team (which
comprises BIOQUELL technicians and equipment
permanently located at the hospital). Our first implant
team has now been continuously in place at a US hospital
for nearly two years. We are expecting the publication
shortly of further research involving BIOQUELL's
technology successfully reducing superbug  related
infection rates in a hospital. In addition, the launch
of the BIOQUELL Z will extend the Group's product
offering further into the healthcare sector.
In 2006 the Group saw increased levels of demand from
defence customers in the UK and overseas for its CBRN
filtration and environmental control equipment, including
substantial sales to US vehicle manufacturers supplying
vehicles deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Demand for 
this equipment has increased further in the first-quarter 
of this year and we expect defence-related contracts 
to contribute significantly to turnover in the 
Bio-decontamination division in 2007.
TRAC division
The TRAC division also performed well in 2006 with strong
increases in turnover and profitability from the businesses
acquired in late 2005. The property moves are proceeding
well and the division has three well equipped  centres of
excellence' as well as some highly competent and
successful regional offices providing effective levels of
customer service. The senior management of Cape was
changed during 2006 and we are expecting Cape's
performance to improve significantly in 2007, in part
due to a substantially reduced cost base. Activity from
companies operating in the defence sector increased,
particularly given the increased levels of governmental
investment in electronic-based warfare and counter-
terrorism technologies. In addition, activity from
aerospace clients remains at high levels. We are seeing
the success of 2006 continuing into 2007 - in part
assisted by the increasing market recognition of the
 TRAC Global' brand.
Prospects
Your Board anticipates that the improvements and
developments seen in 2006 will continue into 2007. The
benefits of a more extensive international sales network
on the back of new products should be seen this year - as
well as increased interest in BIOQUELL's technology from
the healthcare and defence sectors. In particular, demand
for the Group's CBRN technology has been strong so far
this year. We also expect the performance from the TRAC
division to improve during the year. The prospects for the
Group, across both divisions, continue to improve both in
the UK and internationally.

During 2006 the TRAC businesses were melded into a
coherent and effective division, able to win large contracts
from substantial multi-nationals.
