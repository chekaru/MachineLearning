 02 BNS Telecom Group PLC Report and financial statements 2007
Chairman' s 
statement
Overview
The Group' s core Business Reseller Division, including 3g Comms (3g )
acquired during the second half of the financial year, performed 
well and showed good organic growth in sales and operating profit.
However, the Network Services Division, which was the subject of 
a detailed and extensive strategic review initiated on 14 June 2007 , 
was closed on 29 October 2007 , the Board having explored all options
for this division. Strenuous efforts were made to dispose of the Network
Services Division over recent months and whilst there was interest from
a number of potential acquirers, the Board concluded that the best
option was the rapid closure of the Division.
The Business Reseller Division increased sales from  20.37 million 
in 2006 to  26.20 million in 2007 , including a revenue contribution 
of  3.45 million from 3g in the four months under BNS ownership.
Operating profits for this enlarged division grew by 210 per cent. to
 1.59 million before goodwill charges. A new service provider contract
with Vodafone was signed and most significantly the Group started 
to market its newly developed Hosted IPTelephony service. 
The Board believes the development of its IPTelephony service will
result in a transformation of BNS from reseller  in 2006 to switched
reseller  and now to IP carrier . This will enable BNS to exploit 
the growing demand from SMEs forVoIP products and services. 
The Network Services Division consisted of four businesses acquired
over the last two years. The expected revenue growth and operational
leverage did not materialise and all the businesses underperformed.
Following the strategic review the Board completed the Division' s
closure at 29 October 2007 . Consequently the Network Services
Division reported a heavy level of losses and impairment charges.
Separately, the Group completed a sale and leaseback on its head
office premises at Prudhoe in Northumberland generating a one-off
cash inflow of  4.79 million including a profit of  1.02 million. 
Financials
Group turnover increased by 32 per cent to  34.91 million for the
year to 31July 2007 . This largely arose as a result of a 29 per cent. 
rise in sales in the enlarged Business Reseller Division to  26.20 million
(2006:  20.37 million), including a four month contribution of  3.45
million from 3g. Excluding 3g, the Business reseller Division increased
turnover by 12 per cent. to  22.75 million (2006:  20.37 million). The
Network Services Division, which has now been discontinued,
contributed turnover of  8.70 million (2006:  6.09 million).
The core Business Reseller Division substantially increased operating
profit to  1.69 million (2006:  0.55 million) before goodwill charges 
of  0.06 million (2006:  nil) and operating exceptional items of 
 0.12 million (2006:  0.04 million). 
The total operating loss in the discontinued Network Services Division
was  5.97 million (2006: profit  0.03 million). This total loss comprised
trading losses in the order of  1.50 million, balance sheet write-offs
(including bad debt provisions) of approximately  2.8 million and non
cash costs relating to goodwill and fixed asset impairment of some
 1.70 million. 
Group operating loss before goodwill charges and exceptional items
was  1.77 million (2006: profit  0.64 million). Total Group operating 
loss was  4.45 million (2006: profit  0.54 million). 
During the year, the Group completed a sale and lease back of its
freehold head office facilities for  4.79 million in cash, giving rise to a
profit on disposal of  1.02 million. This reduced the loss on ordinary
activities before interest and taxation to  3.43 million (2006: profit
 0.54 million). 
Net interest payable in the year increased to  0.30 million (2006: 
 0.07 million) as a result of increased interest charges associated 
with the debt taken on to finance the development of the head office
building and the acquisition of 3g. This resulted in a pre tax loss for
the year of  3.73 million (2006: profit  0.47 million). 
The Group had a tax credit in the period of  0.20 million 
(2006: charge  0.22 million) as a result of the utilisation of tax losses
arising during the year in the Network Services Division. The credit has 
also been increased by an overprovision in 2006 and a release of 
a deferred tax liability during the year.
Loss per share for the year was 7 .01p (2006: earnings of 0.47p)
reflecting the operating loss in the Network Services Division. Adjusted
Basic Loss per share excluding the after tax effect of goodwill charges,
share based payment charges (note 24) and other exceptional items
(as detailed in note 6) was 3.71p (2006: earnings of 0.61p).
The Board is not proposing the payment of a final dividend 
(2006: 0.5p). It is the intention of the Board to resume dividend
payments as soon as future profitability permits.  03 BNS Telecom Group PLC Report and financial statements 2007
The Directors believe that the outlook for the Group 
is now considerably more favourable and anticipate
strong cash generation in the current financial year. 
The Group experienced a net operating cash outflow of  0.88 million
during the year. Of the outflow,  2.89 million reflects the funding of
working capital in the Network Services business. This was partially
offset by a positive cash inflow from operating activities in the Business
Reseller Division and  4.79 million proceeds from the sale and leaseback
of the Group' s head office property. The proceeds were used to repay 
an on-demand loan of  3.5 million taken out specially to fund develop-
ment of the head office property. The Group subsequently financed 
the  4.85 million acquisition of 3g through a new banking facility. 
At the 31July 2007 , the Group had net debt of  2.75 million (2006:
debt  0.73 million). 
On 30 March 2007 , the Group completed the acquisition of the entire
share capital of 3g Comms Limited and 3g Landline Limited (together
 3g') for a total cash consideration of  4.85 million. The acquisition
provided the Group with an immediate increase in scale in the mobile
market as well as potential cross selling opportunities. It also provided
the Group with a significant market presence in the Birmingham area,
allowing cross-selling opportunities for other BNS fixed line products 
to the 3g customer base. At the 31July 2007 3g had 13,306 mobile
subscribers and 321 fixed line customers. 
Earlier in the year, BNS completed the acquisition of 70 per cent. 
of the share capital of Citygate Telecom Limited on 18 October 2006
for  100,000. However, this operation was subsequently closed, 
being part of the discontinued Network Services Division.
The Group invested  1.7 million in tangible fixed assets during the
year. Of this total  0.95 million was invested to complete the head
office building and  0.2 million was invested in the Group' s VoIP
platform. Total expenditure on the head office buildings amounted 
to  2.7 million, of which  1.77 million was disclosed as assets in 
course of construction at the prior year end. The  1 million book
value of the original head office building was also disposed of 
as part of the sale and leaseback transaction.
Capital expenditure in the second half of the year was much reduced
as anticipated at the half year stage. 
Directors and Staff
During the year there have been several changes to the Board. 
On 23 May 2007 , it was announced that Mark Stewart, Director in
charge of Network Services Division, had resigned from the Board 
and he left the Group with immediate effect.
On 7September 2007 , Andrew Goldwater was appointed Group
Finance Director of the Group, replacing David Horrocks who left 
BNS at that time. Andrew Goldwater is 33 years old and joined BNS 
in March 2007 having spent eight years with Ernst & Young where he
reached senior manager level. 
The Directors recognise the efforts of our management and staff in
achieving robust results in the Direct Reseller Business, including the
new members of the BNS team at 3g, and thank members of staff 
for their diligence and hard work.
Outlook
Having integrated 3g into the Group and successfully launched 
the new IP based telephony solutions to the market, BNS' strategy
during 2008 is organic growth through the cross-selling of products 
to its enlarged customer base whilst also continually looking to add
new customers. 
The development of the suite of IPTelephony solutions over the last two
years has given the Group an excellent platform for profitable growth.
The sales order intake from the IP-based products reported at the half
year has started to be converted to cash. The Group has now secured
a total contracted value of over  4m which includes a significant
element of deferred income. 
The Directors believe that the outlook for the Group is now
considerably more favourable and anticipate strong cash 
generation in the current financial year.
