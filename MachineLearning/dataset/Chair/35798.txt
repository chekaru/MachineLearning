CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REPORT
4
This is my first report as CEO of Byotrol plc, having been appointed in April 2010.  The period under 
review demonstrates a year of real progress as we seek to transform our business into a profitable and cash 
generative enterprise. We have achieved several key operational milestones against a challenging market 
environment and there is a transformational sense about the business. Consequently I would like to start by 
thanking the Byotrol team who have worked tirelessly throughout the year to help bring about the changes 
necessary in order to achieve these objectives.  
Overview 
Product sales for the year were  1,897,899, and include an important increase in repeatable end-user demand. 
The development of sustainable sales growth is a priority towards our goal of achieving break even and 
positive cash generation at the earliest opportunity.  
On a like for like basis, underlying revenues grew by an encouraging 27%, excluding the one-off swine flu 
effect in the previous year.  In addition we had the first full year benefit of sales from our acquired Petcare 
business, Byofresh. Both of these income streams represent a more predictable and stable demand that is 
central to achieving our overall goals.  
Margins achieved during the year were 35.9%. Throughout the year we have maintained a close focus on 
expenses including achieving a targeted annual reduction in overheads of c.  475,000.  
We have changed our strategic direction on Healthcare to move away from an exclusive arrangement with 
one partner, in order to open up new opportunities more rapidly. This resulted in reduced licence and 
royalty income of  33,314 compared to last year (2010:  525,797). As a result, and despite good overhead
control, the effect of lower overall volumes, the reduction in Healthcare royalties (caused by the non 
payment by Synergy Health of a contractual royalty payment of  200,000) and some one-off costs 
(comprising restructuring costs of  110,875 and an increased share scheme charge of  100,000 relating to the 
acquisition of Byofresh) led to increased losses of  2,757,638. Without the effect of these items, totalling 
 410,875, the loss would have been  2,346,763.   
I am nonetheless pleased to report real and continued progress in each of our core market sectors towards the 
goal of Byotrol being the leading global ingredient brand for microbial control. The past year has produced a 
series of highlights that underpin this ambition. These are detailed in the sector review below. 
During the course of this first year I have also made a number of operational changes in order to enhance 
our overall effectiveness.  These include augmenting our sales and marketing capability, the development 
of new relationships with larger scale distribution partners, achievement of external verification of 
Byotrol's unique competitive advantage, and articulation of this into a compelling business case for change.  
We have also restructured our USA operations and extended into other territories, including Africa.  Due to 
continued tight focus on cost control, this has largely been achieved whilst maintaining current headcount.  
We have expanded our technical capability with the benefit of a substantial  443,000 grant over a 3 year 
period and have been able to further invest in technology and IP protection - the lifeblood of our business.

During the course of the year we have achieved two strategic objectives: the unequivocal, evidence-based, 
demonstration of Byotrol's unique competitive advantage, and a marked improvement in the management 
of our channels to market.  
Extensive comparative testing, both in-use and in independent laboratories, has now shown that Byotrol 
products offer a demonstrable performance improvement over current competing products in both 
consumer and business markets. Ground breaking work with two leading testing organisations, Campden 
BRI and BluTest laboratories, has reinforced Byotrol's innovative residual performance against a broad

Current trading outlook 
The Group continues to strengthen under the leadership of Gary Millar.  Whilst progress has been slower than 
planned, a number of new propositions bring the prospect of a significant increase in sustainable revenue and 
cash generation in the coming year. The timing and quantum of these opportunities will impact the Group's 
cash requirements, which are continually monitored by the Board.  The current growth outlook remains 
positive, despite the continuing global economic uncertainty.

On behalf of the Board, I would also like to record our sincere thanks to all the Byotrol team for their efforts 
during the past year.  We are proud of the significant progress they have achieved, despite the challenging 
external conditions.
