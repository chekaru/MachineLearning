 UK and Southern Ireland
operations
Results
I am pleased to report that the UK
and Southern Ireland operations
achieved another record profit on
ordinary activities before taxation of
 61.0 million for the 53 weeks to 
3 May 2003, an increase of 16.2%
compared to last year.
Sales for the year were 
 386.8 million, an increase of
7.0% on last year . This growth 
was achieved from a like for like
sales increase of 2.6%, sales from
additional space of 2.7% with the
remainder due to the impact of the
additional trading week in the year.
As noted at the interim results in
December , the extra trading week
contributed  0.6 million of
additional profit for the year. 
The sales performance was very
different over the two halves. In the
first half we achieved an excellent
5.1% increase in like for like sales,
whilst in the second half like for 
like sales were flat, in line with the
slow down seen across much of
the market. Despite this, we still
outperformed the market in the
period and we remain confident 
that our business proposition will
enable us to continue to grow
market share.
Gross margin improved by 
1.6 percentage points to 59.6%.
This increase was weighted towards
the second half in which we
achieved a 2.5 percentage point
improvement as we benefited from
the full impact of our investment,
innovation, buying scale and
efficiencies. We continue to make
progress with the expansion of 
our in house and new five metre
cutting facilities combined with 
our drive to increase the average 
transaction value through a
combination of product offering
and improved service.
Costs as a percentage of sales
grew by 1.0 percentage points 
to 45.0% during the year. This is
primarily a result of our investment
in the five metre cutting facility and
taking further cutting in house
which in turn has supported some
of the improvement in gross margin.
The launch of an extensive cost
saving programme in the second
half has offset the investment we
continue to make in our service
offering. We expect the full benefits
of this cost saving programme 
to come through in the current
financial year.

Carpetright plc
Annual report and
accounts 2003
We have achieved another strong set
of results in the UK despite more difficult
trading conditions and have made
good progress on the first stage of our
plans in Europe.  Operating margin has increased 
by 0.6 percentage points to 15.0%,
a record for the business, and a
significant achievement in light of
the more difficult trading environment.
Stores
We continue to actively manage
our property portfolio as we seek
to infill certain gaps in our national
coverage. We opened 30 stores 
in the year and closed 26, giving
net space at the year end of
3,411,000 sq ft. Property profits
for the year were  3.8 million, which
comprised  2.3 million from surrender
of leasehold properties and 
 1.5 million from the relocation and
subsequent sale of a freehold interest.
New channels
We continue to increase the
penetration of our van business,
which serves the Carpetright at
home customer as well as providing
important support to some of our
insurance customers. The business
is now profitable in its own right
while the insurance business has
continued to grow strongly over
the last two and a half years.
Service
We continue to invest in our business
to improve the overall service. This
year we invested in more estimators,
improved systems, a better
delivery service as well as starting
the fitters' assessment and training
programme with FITA (Flooring
Industry Training Association).
European acquisition
We have made significant progress
towards our three-year plan for the
European business, which we wholly
acquired on 31 October 2002.
Once the acquisition was
complete we accelerated the pace
of change to ensure all restructuring
was completed during the year 
to 3 May 2003. 
In this time we have
- Closed the distribution centre
and rationalised central service
functions by leveraging the wider
services and experience within
Carpetright;
- Modernised a third of the estate
while re-merchandising and 
reorganising the balance of the
stores, two stores have been closed;
- Removed the d cor products
from the stores and refocused
them on floor coverings only;
- Invested in price and promotions
to drive market share, supported
by our Group sourcing synergies;
- Reviewed and changed working
practices to improve sales focus,
communication lines, reward
structure and controls across 
the business.
Our objective in Europe is to create
a focused, market-leading, floor
covering specialist, which will sell
increased volumes of product to the
mass market and generate good
returns over a three to five year period.
Having now traded in both
Holland and Belgium for a number
of months we remain confident
that the potential for our proposition
in both the market and the
competitive environment is significant
and that we can achieve our goals
over the medium term. 
Results
Trading in Holland has been in line
with our expectations and we have
seen good market share growth
from the sale of floor covering
products. In Belgium trading has
been slower and, whilst floor
covering sales have increased, we
still have an overall shortfall after
the removal of the d cor products.
The business has recorded 
an adjusted operating loss* for the
year of  2.9 million with additional
financing costs of a further 
 1.0 million in respect of interest
on the loan we took to acquire 
the business as well as local
borrowings. 
Additionally as a result of the
acceleration of the restructuring of
the European business we have
now expensed all the exceptional
costs relating to the process in the
year to 3 May 2003, which is 
in line with our guidance in our
post Easter trading statement. 
This amounted to a total of 
 5.4 million. The goodwill charge
for the 10 months to 3 May 2003
is  0.7 million.
Group summary
Earnings per share and dividend
The adjusted Group earnings per
share* are up 16.1% to 56.2p.
Basic earnings per share was 50.7p
(2002: 48.4p).
The Group purchased 
1.58 million of its own shares
on 29 April at a price of 581.2p, 
at a total transaction value of 
 9.3 million including fees and tax.
The Board is recommending that
the final dividend be increased by
10.0% to 22p per share, which 
together with the interim dividend
of 15p takes the total dividend 
for the year to 37p per share, an
increase of 12.1% on the prior 
year. The final dividend will be 
paid on 26 September 2003
to shareholders on the register 
on 12 September 2003.
Finance and cash flow
The Group generated an operating
cash flow of  72.6 million, an
increase of 28.8% on last year. 
At the end of the year the Group
had net debt of  33.8 million, made
up of a five year term loan of 
 32.4 million, loans and overdrafts
in Europe of  11.6 million, finance
leases of  3.0 million and cash
balances in the UK of  11.6 million,
and Europe of  1.6 million.
Outlook
In the first eight weeks of the current
financial year, the UK and Southern
Ireland operation has achieved
sales up 3.0% with like for like sales
up 2.2%. Gross margin continues
to show good growth against the
previous year. May and June are,
though, relatively low periods for
the business and a more accurate
indication of progress for the half
will be given at our AGM and in
the early autumn announcement
later in the year.
In our European operations
the sales performance is slightly
below our expectations for the first
two months of the year.
Nevertheless we are continuing to
see good growth in the meterage
of floor coverings sold. Our focus
for the coming period will be to
grow our market share and benefit
from the improved margins and
lower costs that we have put in place.
The Group has made significant
progress in the last 12 months and
we look forward to the current year
with confidence.
I would like to take this
opportunity to thank our staff for 
all their hard work over the past
year. Their skills, experience and
dedication continue to enable us
to maintain our position as the world' s
leading floor coverings retailer.

Direct
access...
We continue to invest in our new channels to the customer 
with our Carpetright at home proposition now trading profitably 
from 32 vans across the country whilst also serving our growing
insurance business.
Expanding 
into 
Europe...
We completed our first move into Europe with the acquisition of a business
trading in Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg in October 2002. This provides 
a low risk route to take the best ideas from our UK business and combine
them with the local market to create the first step of our European expansion.
