MANAGEMENT 
DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
AND BUSINESS REVIEW
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
The report contains certain forward-looking statements and attention is drawn to the 
cautionary statement that appears at the front of this document. 
HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE YEAR
Despite a challenging year, Centamin delivered strong operational and financial 
results in 2011, producing  202,699 ounces of gold (2010: 83,432 ounces) and 
generating profit for the year of US$181.9 million (2010: US$32.0 million). Through 
the Group's emphasis on rigorous cost control, Centamin has continued to reap the 
benefits of the high gold price, and this was enhanced further by its debt-free and 
unhedged position.  Now in its second year of production, the Sukari Gold Mine is 
highly cash generative, with EBITDA of US$235.0 million (2010: US$52.8 million), 
a 345% increase on 2010, and a robust cash and cash equivalents balance of 
US$164.2 million (2010: US$154 million) as at 31 December 2011. See non-GAAP 
measures section (page 24) for the definition of EBITDA.
Operationally, the first half of 2011 was challenging, but a solid third quarter and a 
record fourth quarter of production have shown that a substantially larger production 
profile is achievable for Sukari.  Although Egypt is undergoing political transition, 
this potential for production growth combined with the Group's growing reserves, 
a significant expansion programme, a solid financial position, and an experienced 
team means Centamin is well positioned for 2012.

Production
Centamin bettered its quarter on quarter 
gold production throughout the year. It 
achieved record gold production in Q4 
bringing the 2011 production to 202,699 
ounces. For detailed information on 
each quarter's performance see various 
press releases available on our  website.
Open Pit
Material movement from the pit was 
21.2Mt for the year. Ore mined was at 
6.3Mt at an average grade of 1.07 grams 
per tonne and a stripping ratio of 2.34:1 
of waste to ore. The open pit performed 
strongly in Q4, delivering more than 
6.3Mt for October and November and 
2.8Mt in December, achieving total 
material movement of over 7.7Mt for 
the quarter, an increase of 33% on the 
previous quarter (5.8Mt).  
Staged pit development progressed 
well. Mining in Stage 1 was completed 
and continued in Stage 2 down to 
the 1004RL and 1076RL respectively. 
Pioneering work continued in the Stage 
3 pit in preparation for large scale load 
and haul activities to commence in 2012.
Underground Mine
The underground mine continued to 
ramp up smoothly during the year, 
with ore production reaching 212kt, in 
stoping and development combined. 
Grades were consistently high, as 
several very well grading structures on 
levels 890 and 875 were mined. The 
ratio of stoping ore to development 
ore mined continued to increase as 
a teleremote bogging system was 
commissioned at the end of November 
and further stopes came on line. 
Development of the Amun Decline 
advanced reaching the 845 level take off 
point.  After establishing the 860 access, 
the level was opened further into the 
porphyry for over 55 metres, while ore 
development continued on the 875 level 
(223m) and 890 level (257m). Diamond 
drilling from the 850 level indicated a 
continuation of the high grade zone 
encountered on the southern side of the 
875 level.
With higher material movements from 
the open pit and underground, the run of 
mine ore stockpile balance increased to 
720kt by the end of the year.
Development of the Ptah Decline, which 
will move towards the north of Sukari Hill 
and provide access to the high grade 
Julius zone, began in October 2011 and 
had advanced 140 metres by year end. 
The Ptah Decline will take underground 
activity away from the pit shell over 
the next two years, allowing Centamin 
to maintain two separate production 
sources once the Amun Decline 
becomes part of the open pit.
The underground production rate is 
expected to increase to 350,000 tonnes 
per annum in 2012 and the introduction 
of the Ptah Decline will increase it further 
to approximately 500,000tpa from 2013.  
The anticipated capital cost of the Ptah 
Decline is US$18 million.
