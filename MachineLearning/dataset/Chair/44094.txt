 Review of operations
(All operating profit items referred to in this section are
shown prior to exceptional costs and goodwill amortisation
and impairment.*)
Our business now operates in three divisions; Public
Relations which represented 64% of our operating 
income in 2003, Integrated Marketing Services 31% 
and Research 5%.
In terms of operating profit* these divisions contributed
67%, 26% and 7% respectively.
Public Relations
Our Public Relations business gained market share in a
depressed market. Operating income declined by 2% but
operating profit* rose by 14% to  4.8 million. Operating
profit margin* increased from 12.4% to 14.4%.
There were strong performances from Bell Pottinger
Financial, Bell Pottinger Public Affairs, QBO Bell Pottinger
Public Relations, Good Relations, Insight and MMK in
Germany which all performed ahead of last year.

2003 as a year was slightly worse than 2002 but it does
seem to us to have marked the end of the downturn.
Performance across the year was reasonably stable and
given a poor third quarter and improving trading conditions
in the fourth quarter it looks to us that stability will continue
in to 2004.
Market sentiment suggests some growth in 2004. This has
not been the case since the end of the first half of 2001.
In 2003 operating income on continuing operations declined
by 10% from  58.4 million to  52.7 million. Operating profit
on continuing operations (prior to exceptional items and
goodwill amortisation and impairment) declined by 9%
from  7.9 million to  7.2 million.
In response to the continued decline in revenue we cut
costs further. Operating costs on continuing activities 
(prior to exceptional costs and goodwill amortisation and
impairment) reduced by 10% from  50.5 million to 
 45.5 million.
Our headline operating profit margin rose from 12.0% in
2002 to 13.2% in 2003. 
We had some, although much reduced, exceptional costs
in 2003 and these together with goodwill amortisation and
impairment are explained later. 
In statutory terms our operating loss for 2003 was 
 0.7 million compared to  33.5 million in 2002.
Our net debt position at 31 December 2003 was
 29.3 million compared to  32.4 million at 31 December
2002. We operated within our agreed covenants throughout
2003. We have two years remaining on our agreed three
year facility with the Royal Bank of Scotland and they
continue to be very supportive.
The Group has announced a placing and open offer to
raise  18.5 million (net of expenses), the proceeds of
which will be used to reduce the company's debt levels.

declined by 40% to  1.9 million. Operating profit margin* in
2003 was 11.2% compared to 14.2% the previous year.

New business wins in 2003 included Madame Tussauds,
Air Miles, SVM Asset Management, Visit London,
Schroders and RNLI.
Research
Our Research business continues to do well but had two
major projects delayed from the end of 2003 into 2004
which caused their performance in 2003 to be slightly
below that of 2002.
Operating income increased by 4% but operating profit*
declined by 10%. Operating profit margin* was 20.6%
compared to 23.9% in 2002.
New business wins in 2003 included Food Standards
Agency, Siemens and the Office for Public Service Reform.
Business activity
The Group acted for 1,013 clients in 2003, compared to
1,073 in 2002. 98 were shared across two of our divisions,
compared to 94 in 2002.
122 clients paid us over  100,000 compared to 143 in
2002. Our top 30 clients represented 30% of total
operating income (2002: 27%) and our largest client
represented 2.6% of total operating income (2002: 2.1%).
Average fee per client was  53,000, compared to  58,000
in 2002. 
Operating income per head was  90,000 in 2003
compared to  84,000 in 2002.

as discussed further in the corporate activity section below.)
Corporate activities
In February 2003 the Group sold 49% of HHCL & Partners
Ltd to WPP Group (UK) Limited for  3.5 million in cash.
HHCL has become part of the international Red Cell Group
owned by WPP . Chime has the right to sell its remaining
interest in HHCL to WPP after 1 January 2004. Under the
terms of the agreement WPP will have day-to-day
management control of HHCL. HHCL is now accounted
for as an associate undertaking.
In December 2003 the Group purchased 70% of TTA
Public Relations Limited (TTA), a property marketing
business. Chime's existing property marketing business
has been merged with TTA. The initial consideration was
satisfied in cash and 624,936 fully paid ordinary shares,
with a further payment due in December 2004. Further
consideration will be payable depending on the profit
performance for the years to 31 December 2003 and
2004. This further consideration has been capped at a

Outlook
Our business has seen declining profits since the second
half of 2001 in contrast to the previous seven years of
double-digit growth. It would appear that the decline
bottomed out in 2003 and we anticipate that 2004 should
be the beginning of the return to growth.
There is an encouraging upturn in market confidence and
because of the major cost cutting we have carried out over
the last two-and-a-half years we are in a strong position to
benefit from increased activity.
The first two months of 2004 have confirmed this view but
there still is low visibility for the second half of the year.
This slow return to growth means that the second half is
likely to be better than the first half. The continuing
pressure on expenditure and fees means that we must
continue to control our costs effectively whilst maintaining
capacity for the upturn.
In the first two months of 2004 we continued to be
successful in new business across the Group. Major wins
so far include BT, Sportingbet, Castrol, Topps Tiles,
Scottish Widows, Entertainment Rights, Loaded, HBOS
and Imperial Tobacco.
The new business pipeline is very full which is why we are
more optimistic about the marketplace in 2004. Our Public
Relations business is the leading brand in the UK. The new
management and restructuring of our Heresy Integrated
Marketing Services Group is beginning to show results and
our Research business continues to be a market leader.
For the first time for two and a half years we are more
positive about our prospects.

Annual Report & Accounts 2003
Group Chief Executive's review
The new communications environment
demands a group which understands
what really motivates target audiences
and the way they want to be communicated
to on their terms; not in a broadcast, but 
as a dialogue.
The question I get asked most often is what makes
Chime's approach to communication different?
However, the advice I give most often to people wishing to
communicate is to rely less on first-person advocacy and
more on third-party endorsement; be it from staff,
customers, stakeholders, journalists, opinion formers, or
people in positions of leadership.
So, although we have several answers to what makes
Chime's approach competitive, I would not be following our
own advice if I protested about these too much here. 
I believe it's more valuable to look at the views of our
customers and the market place in general; both of which
are the subjects of a major new research project from
Opinion Leader Research. 
The main findings, at this stage in the research, can be
summarised as follows:
  Inexorable shift to the reactive pressurising the
strategic: 24/7 communication, the multiplicity of
stakeholders, breakdown in trust, tabloidisation of
media; they have created huge pressures for all
communicators to respond and react  on the hoof'.
There is a clear need both for defined and  owned'
strategic frameworks to shape communications and
for clearly understood points of view that run
throughout organisations.
  New vulnerability: The spreading number of
reference points and the potential of every
stakeholder to become a  big voice' means that
traditional stakeholder management techniques
are no longer sufficiently flexible. As one of our
clients said, the combination of access to
better information and the ability to use
technology means that stakeholders need to be
treated with even more care and caution . Of
our sample, 67% agree that every individual and
organisation can have a  big voice', however
unrepresentative.
