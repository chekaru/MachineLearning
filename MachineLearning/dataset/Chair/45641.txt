increase in Group profitability
 
INTRODUCTION
I am delighted to report a significant increase in Group profitability for 2013. Group revenue and operating profit 
increased substantially, driven by our strategies of excellence in design, quality and service, supported by long term 
investment into all facets of our business. The Hospitality business reported record revenues building on its strong 
position in growing markets. Our Balance Sheet remains robust.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Total Group revenues increased by 4% to  43.2m (2012:  41.4m).
Group operating profit increased by 19% to  3.4m (2012:  2.8m). Operating margins improved to 7.8% (2012: 
6.8%) as a result of increased factory volumes and more favourable exchange rates. Earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation increased by 12% to  5.0m (2012:  4.4m).
Group profit before tax rose by 24% to  3.4m (2012 restated:  2.7m), with the improved operating performance 
supported by an increased contribution from our associate company. Comparative profit figures for 2012 have 
been restated to reflect the introduction of IAS 19 (revised) in relation to interest on pension fund liabilities.
Earnings per share improved by 29% to 25.2p (2012 restated: 19.6p).
We have continued to generate strong operating cash flows which allow us to invest in the development of our 
business and to deliver increased returns to shareholders. Operating cash generation was  4.6m (2012:  3.4m) after 
allowing for acceleration of pension fund amortisation payments. We continued to manage working capital well 
and have substantially reduced inventory levels during the period. At the end of the year net cash and deposit 
balances had risen by  1.2m to  8.2m (2012:  7.0m). We continue to invest in the capabilities of our business. Capital 
investment was  1.5m (2012:  1.3m) of which the largest part related to the long term development of our Stoke-
on-Trent manufacturing facility.
Dividend and Shareholder Return
The Board is recommending a 0.3p increase in the final dividend to 9.7p per share (2012: 9.4p), giving a total of 
14.6p for the year (2012: 14.2p). We appreciate, in the current climate, the value that our investors place on a 
progressive dividend policy and a yield from their investment. If approved, the final dividend will be paid on 23 May 
2014 to shareholders on the register on 25 April 2014.
Total shareholder returns have again been good reflecting both our return to dividend growth and our improved 
performance. Overall returns were 35% (2012: 16%) during the year.

The Hospitality business reported record revenues
 
HOSPITALITY
Bamboo Bamboo Bamboo
Total sales to our Hospitality customers increased by  3.4m (11%) and reached an all time high of  32.8m (2012: 
 29.4m). Contribution to Group operating profits rose to  5.1m from  4.2m.
The UK market was buoyant across the second half of 2013. Despite an unprecedented level of orders in the 
pre-Christmas build up, our production and logistics specialists were able to maintain the impressive service levels 
for which Churchill is renowned. As UK market leader, we operate in all end user sectors through a wide range 
of national and regional distributors. It is pleasing to record that our UK sales team delivered a 10% increase in 
sales during the period. This was indicative of healthy background demand and was not dominated by large new 
installations. 
Our export revenues increased by an impressive 14% in 2013. To support this strategy to grow our export business 
requires substantial investment in sales, marketing and new product development. Potential overseas customers 
are not necessarily aware of the fact that the vitrified, pin fired fine china that we manufacture in Stoke-on-Trent 
performs better in use than equivalent porcelain, stoneware or bone china. We believe that a spread of international 
markets offers a wider and therefore more stable future platform for the business.
The success of our design portfolio and in particular Bamboo, Vintage Prints and Stonecast, are clear evidence that 
the Churchill new product development and marketing teams are fully aligned to market trends. It is worth noting 
that many of our end users are asking for surface decoration, usually more associated with retail or domestic fashion, 
but with commercial performance criteria. This allows us to optimise the use of our manufacturing capabilities.

Product excellence requires  
manufacturing excellence 
There was a steady increase in production levels over the year 
and as a result factory efficiency improved. It is pleasing to 
note that our programme of sustained investment over many 
years continues to deliver increased efficiencies. We are 
fully committed to our manufacturing and logistics facilities 
in Stoke-on-Trent. We operate from single storey, modern 
buildings on a 26 acre site with plenty of room for expansion.
Product excellence requires manufacturing excellence 
both in terms of quality and value. New investment projects 
completed in 2013 included the installation of a new clay 
waste recovery system, robotics for the manufacture of large 
flatware products and the purchase of an Eisenmann glost 
kiln. We expect that this kiln, to be commissioned later in 2014, 
will deliver benefits across our operational base, generating 
improvements in energy efficiency, labour costs, yield, 
flexibility and tighter technical control.

our Retail and Hospitality businesses 
RETAIL
Retail saw a small decline in contribution to Group 
operating profits during the year to  1.2m (2012: 
 1.4m). Sales were affected by increased costs on 
imported ranges as a result of the EU Anti-Dumping 
Duties on imported products and declined by 14% to 
 10.4m (2012:  12.0m). We opted to increase prices 
to cover these new taxes and this resulted in reduced 
volumes.
Our strategy to develop sales of our own branded 
higher margin products such as Caravan Trail and 
Little Rhymes is working well as sales in some of our 
major licences have reduced. 
There remains great synergy between our Retail and 
Hospitality businesses. An increasing proportion of 
our printing technology and capacity is now being 
applied to the development and growth of successful 
products such as Vintage Prints for our Hospitality 
accounts.

PEOPLE
We have a talented, dedicated and hard working team of people at Churchill who can be justly proud of their 
achievements. Their Health and Safety and attendance records are excellent. I am proud to report that a total of 
 47,000 was raised for Douglas Macmillan Hospice, our chosen charity for 2013. A big thank you to our workforce, 
their friends and relatives, and to our customers and suppliers who all contributed to this most worthy cause.
Our Board has developed over the year with the appointment of Brendan Hynes as a Non-Executive Director and 
will continue to evolve through 2014. Andrew Roper will retire as an Executive Director in August and will assume 
a non-executive role. The succession process is well underway and David O'Connor, currently Chief Operating 
Officer, will be formally appointed to the role of Chief Executive Officer in the summer.

PROSPECTS
2013 was another good year for Churchill China. Our 
strategies continue to lay down the platform for the future 
growth of our Hospitality business and our pragmatic but 
passionate team have the right blend of expertise and 
talent to deliver these plans.
Churchill's strong balance sheet enables us to take a long 
term view of investment in all aspects of the business from 
factory efficiency to sales, marketing and new product 
development. 
Despite uncertainties with the global economy and 
unfavourable currency rates the Board expects that 
Churchill will continue to deliver further shareholder value 
in 2014.
