 Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Company's 2008 Annual 
Report and Financial Statements following another 
year of outstanding exploration success, resource 
de v elopment 	 and 	 pr ojec t 	 enhancement 	 at 	 our	
por tf olio 	 of 	 coal 	 and 	 coal 	 bed 	 methane 	 pr ojec ts 	 in	
Indonesia.
By far the most significant progress was achieved 
at 	 our 	 flagship 	 East 	 K utai 	 C oal 	 P r ojec t 	 (EK CP  ), 	
located approximately 110km west of Sangatta in 
the province of East Kutai, Indonesia, which is rapidly 
emer g ing 	 as 	 a 	 w or ld- class 	 coal 	 asset.
A f t er 	 acquir ing 	 a 	 75% 	 stak e 	 in 	 the 	 EK CP 	 in 	 2007,	
Chur chill 	 M ining 	 P lc 	 (Chur chill  ) 	 made 	 rapid	
progress during the year in the delineation of a very 
lar ge , 	 sub -bituminous 	 ther mal 	 coal 	 r esour ce .	
Such was our confidence in the scale of the EKCP 
discovery that, in November 2007, the Company 
complet ed 	 a 	  10 	 million 	 equit y 	 placement 	 t o	
institutional 	 in v est ors 	 t o 	 fund 	 a 	 major 	 exploration	 	
pr og ramme . 	 T he 	 or ig inal 	 objec tiv e 	 of 	 this 	 campaig n	
was to define approximately 100 million tonnes in 
reserves and 400 million tonnes in resources by the 
end of calendar 2008.
Chairman's Statement
The capital raised 
was also earmarked to 
fund various mining and 
logistical scoping studies, 
assisting Churchill to confirm 
the 	 pr ojec t ' s 	 optimum 	 ex trac tion,	
product transport and financial 
paramet ers , 	 and 	 t o 	 fund 	 ongoing 	 in-fill 	
drilling.

EKCP was delivered in April 2008, significantly 
ahead of our original timetable. An initial resource 
comprising 250 million tonnes was calculated by 
our independent geological consultants, comprising 
a Measured Resource of 44 million tonnes, an 
Indicated Resource of 73 million tonnes and an 
Inferred Resource of 133 million tonnes.
Significantly, this exceeded our initial target of 100 
million 	 t onnes 	 b y 	 150%, 	 with 	 the 	 r esour ce 	 displa ying	
commercial quality characteristics rated as medium 
calorific values with low ash and sulphur content. 
Subsequent to the 2008 reporting period, Churchill 
again announced a significant increase in the 
JOR C- C ode 	 compliant 	 coal 	 r esour ce 	 at 	 the 	 EK CP .	
In September 2008 we lifted the resource to 
1.412 billion tonnes substantially larger than the 
Company's initial target of 500 million tonnes. 
Although this result was subsequent to the end of 
the Financial Year, it warrants inclusion in this report 
due to the massive size of the deposit - which also 
h a s 	 s i g n i fi c a n t 	 u p s i d e , 	 c o n s i d e r i n g 	 t h a t 	 o n l y 	 2 0 % 	 o f	
the coal target area has been drilled to date.
The latest updated resource comprises a Measured 
Resource of 118Mt (up from 44Mt), an Indicated 
Resource of 322Mt (up from 73Mt) and an Inferred 
R esour ce 	 of 	 972Mt 	 (up 	 fr om 	 133Mt). 	 T he 	 near -t er m

During the year, the Company appointed Trans Tek 
Engineering to undertake a Scoping Study on the 
East 	 K utai 	 P r ojec t. 	 T his 	 was 	 complet ed 	 and 	 deliv er ed	
ahead of schedule in June, with very positive results. 
The study concluded that the EKCP can be 
developed utilising a staged approach, with initial 
pr oduc tion 	 commencing 	 at 	 2-3Mtpa, 	 appr o ximat ely	
12 months ahead of our original schedule, while 
infrastructure capable of handling a much larger 
14 - 20Mtpa 	 pr ojec t 	 is 	 construc t ed 	 o v er 	 time .
The Scoping Study also detailed various alternatives 
for mine development, infrastructure and ore 
transportation, providing a strong foundation to 
initiat e 	 pr ojec t 	 financing 	 discussions 	 with 	 a 	 number 	
of 	 in v estment 	 banks 	 and 	 pot ential 	 joint 	 v entur e	
partners specialising in the coal sector.
On the strength of these results, your Board made 
the decision to move immediately to a Full Feasibility 
Study 	 on 	 the 	 pr ojec t, 	 in 	 conjunc tion 	 with 	 ongoing	
drilling.
Chur chill ' s 	 second 	 I ndonesian 	 pr ojec t, 	 the 	 S enda war

with potential to host more than 5 trillion cubic feet 
(Tcf ) of gas.

Summary & Outlook
In a year of extreme volatility on world financial 
and equity markets, I am pleased to report that 
Churchill has maintained its momentum and 
focus with the creation of shareholder wealth our 
number one priority.
The global demand for energy shows no signs of 
subsiding and with this in mind we see coal and 
coal bed methane as some of the best performing 
commodity classes in the foreseeable future. Given 
this outlook, we will continue to actively pursue 
our 	 cur r ent 	 pr ojec ts 	 in 	 I ndonesia, 	 as 	 w ell 	 as 	 ac tiv ely	
assessing further opportunities within this sector.
Coal prices continued to strengthen during the 
reporting year, with spot prices at year end for 
Indonesian thermal coal similar to the specification 
of 	 the 	 East 	 K utai 	 P r ojec t 	 - 	 selling 	 at 	 up 	 t o	 
US$85/tonne.   With the current market financial 
volatility at the time of writing, the markets have 
seen 	 off tak e 	 pr icing 	 on 	 longer 	 t er m 	 contrac ts 	 at 	
between US$60 to US$70/tonne.
S u b j e c t 	 t o 	 c o n t i n u e d 	 e x p l o r a t i o n 	 s u c c e s s , 	 w e 	 e x p e c t	
to be in a position to make a development decision 
at East Kutai in 2009 and believe this will pave the 
wa y 	 f or 	 a 	 substantial 	 r e -rating 	 of 	 Chur chill 	 as 	 a 	 near -
term producing coal company.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank our 
I ndonesian-based 	 Dir ec t ors 	 - 	 M anag ing 	 Dir ec t or ,	
Paul Mazak, and Non Executive Director, Faroek 
B a s r e w a n 	 - 	 f o r 	 t h e i r 	 f o c u s e d 	 e ff o r t s 	 t h r o u g h o u t	
the year, especially in the rapid definition of such 
a large resource which has far exceeded our 
initial expectations.
James Hamilton moved to a non executive position 
on the Churchill Board during the year in order to 
focus on his role as Managing Director of Spitfire 
Resources. Spitfire has made excellent progress in 
its first year as a listed company, delivering positive 
news from the South Woodie Woodie Manganese 
P r ojec t, 	 secur ing 	 a 	 niche 	 ther mal 	 coal 	 pr ojec t 	 in	
T asmania 	 and 	 attrac ting 	 the 	 Nor w eg ian-based 	 g r oup	
Tinfos AS to its share register.
Finally, on behalf of the Board I would like to thank 
all of our shareholders for their continuing support. 
It is our strong belief that the outlook for Churchill 
has never been better since our listing in 2005, 
and we anticipate another landmark year ahead 
for the Company as we progress towards mine 
development and production.
