 Clinical Computing Plc Report & Accounts 2010 02
Chairman's Statement
There are a number of government initiatives in the United 
States, Canada and the United Kingdom that are driving 
innovation in the electronic medical record market. These 
initiatives require specific clinical data to be collected and 
reported to governmental entities primarily to determine the 
quality of care and future reimbursement and funding levels. 
This creates both risk and opportunity for our business  
and we continue to adapt our solution to meet the  
needs of each country and its specific regulations  
and reporting requirements.
Hydra business
The Hydra software provides detailed management 
information across a range of Key Performance Indicators 
(KPI's ) including resource optimisation, programme and 
project status and financial performance. The information 
generated by the Hydra software aids decision making and 
maximises resource efficiencies within an organisation.
Utilisation of the Hydra software enables fully automated 
decision making as the data captured in Hydra can be easily 
integrated with other enterprise systems, thereby providing 
comprehensive, real time information utilised for senior 
decision makers.
During the year under review there has been an increase in 
the demand for the capabilities from existing Hydra 
customers as well as new customers. This has resulted in 
the increased revenues of 41% for the year.
During the year Hydra released version 7.0. This release saw 
the addition of new reporting features and a what if  
planning scenario capability. These features contributed to 
the addition of a number of new customers across a range 
of sectors including financial services, betting, marketing, 
insurance, engineering, and support services. Hydra 
continues to have a strong presence in the public sector 
which uses its software to optimise resource utilisation  
and planning.

Business overview
I am pleased to report that the Group has produced its 
second consecutive year of profitability with an after tax 
profit of  181,291 (2009:  220,394) as well as its second 
consecutive year of positive operating cash flow of 
 185,340 (2009:  219,502).
This performance has been underpinned by consistent new 
sales wins in the Hydra business, and revenues for this 
business unit are up 41% from the prior year. In the Clinical 
business we have re-aligned the cost base to focus the 
business around the clinicalvision technology. This has 
resulted in a cost reduction of 18% in this business unit and 
positions it to deliver improving results.
Clinical business
We now have nine organisations in four countries using the 
clinicalvision web-enabled chronic disease software 
solution. Additionally we expect to have another four 
customers using this product before June 2011. 
Clinicalvision is a web-enabled electronic medical record 
solution that supports the management of chronic disease 
with an emphasis on chronic kidney disease. Clinicalvision 
can be licensed directly by our customers or provided as a 
service via our cloud computing  solution which is now 
available in the US and Canada.
During 2010 the business released its first App  which 
provides clinicalvison users the ability to access patient 
information on the iPhone and iPod Touch. This is the 
beginning of our mobile device initiatives which we hope to 
expand as the web  becomes integrated in the delivery of 
healthcare information. As noted above this business 
launched a cloud computing  solution in Canada and the 
US with three customers using this service.
We have been invited by one of the UK's leading renal 
programmes to participate, as the technology partner, in an 
innovative research program to evaluate the effective use of 
technology to support the multi-disciplinary care of patients 
with kidney disease. The Sussex Renal Innovation 
Programme (SRIP) has been set up to address the 
increasing complexity and cost involved in managing and 
treating patients with chronic kidney disease. The 
Department of Economics, University of Surrey will be 
modelling the before and after costs of care, which are 
intended to be shared with other NHS organisations. As part 
of this project Clinical Computing will be delivering its first 
version of cv-analytics, a clinical analytics module aimed at 
identifying clinical risks across patient groups.
From a marketing perspective we continue to market directly 
to customers in our traditional geographic markets (the 
United States and the United Kingdom) and indirectly via 
Gambro in Canada and Australia. Recently we won a new 
contract with a regional hospital in Australia; and we 
continue to derive benefits from our close working 
relationships with the Gambro sales teams in these 
countries. Clinical Computing Plc Report & Accounts 2010 03
Registered Office
The Company moved its registered office to IP City Centre, 
1 Bath Street, Ipswich IP2 8SD.
Borrowing facilities
In 2010 the Group's operations generated cash of  185,340 
(2009:  219,502). Additionally the Group reduced its cost 
base in 2010 and we are anticipating the full benefit of these 
reductions will flow into 2011's financial results. Given this 
recent performance and the Group's current forecasts and 
projections, which take into account different scenarios with 
respect to trading performance, the directors believe that 
the Group should be able to operate within the level of its 
current banking facilities.
The Group has opened renewal negotiations with its banks 
to extend the current facilities for a further twelve month 
period, on their renewal dates. At this stage it has not 
sought separate written commitment that the facilities will 
be renewed. However, during the course of the negotiations 
so far, no matters have been drawn to the Group's attention 
to suggest that renewal may not be forthcoming on 
acceptable terms.
Outlook
We now have two businesses that when taken together are 
capable of delivering improving results. In the Clinical 
business we look forward to continuing to develop our 
relationship with industry partners, enhancing our clinical 
applications to support new geographic markets and 
extending our license base in our traditional markets of the 
UK and US. The Hydra business has delivered two 
consecutive years of revenue growth and we continue to 
see growing demand for the Hydra products.
We will continue to manage both businesses based on the 
current economic climate and specifically against current 
local, regional and national government funding pressures 
and will manage our cost structure in line with short-term 
opportunities.
