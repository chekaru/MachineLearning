RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
As described in the statement of directors' responsibilities, the company's directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting
standards.  Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant United
Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.  We also report, if, in our opinion, the
directors' report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit,
or if information specified by law regarding directors' remuneration and transactions with the company
and other members of the group is not disclosed.
We read the directors' report and the other information contained in the annual report for the above
period as described in the contents section and consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing
Practices Board.  An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.  It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the circumstances of the company and the group, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity
or error.  In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information
in the financial statements.
OPINION
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and
the group as at 30 September 2002 and of the loss of the group for the year ended and have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with United Kingdom applicable accounting
standards.  The particular accounting policies adopted are described below.
Prior Period Basis of preparation
(i) Acquisition
Comeleon plc was incorporated on 30 August 2000 and on 28 November 2000 acquired the entire
share capital of E-Comeleon Limited. In accordance with the principles set out in Financial Reporting
Standard (FRS ) 6 Acquisitions and Mergers , 93.5% of the shares acquired has been accounted
for under merger accounting. The remaining 6.5% has been accounted for under acquisition
accounting.  On this basis the statutory consolidated profit and loss account comprises the results
of Comeleon plc and E-Comeleon Limited for the period from 30 August 2000 to 30 September
2001.  This has been presented in note 31, in order to comply with section 226 of the Companies
Act 1985.  The statutory cash flow has been prepared on the same basis and is presented in note
32.
(ii) Basis of proforma financial information
The proforma consolidated profit and loss accounts have been presented as if the merger took
place on the first day of each financial period presented.  The figures for the period of 19 August
1999 to 31 March 2000 have been extracted from the audited E-Comeleon Limited accounts
adjusted for the notional 1,135,900 shares issued in exchange for 93.5% of the share capital of E-
Comeleon Limited.  The results have also been adjusted to create a minority interest to reflect the
6.5% of share capital of E-Comeleon Limited, which has been accounted for under the acquisition
method.  The proforma cashflow and comparative company balance sheet have been prepared on
the same basis.
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention.
Consolidation
The financial statements have been consolidated so as to include the results of all subsidiary companies.
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.
Goodwill
The cost of goodwill, being the net premium arising on the acquisition of subsidiary companies, is
amortised over its estimated useful economic life of 20 years in equal annual instalments.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Depreciation on fixed assets is calculated to write off their cost, less estimated residual value, over their
expected useful lives at the following annual rates using the straight line method.
Plant and machinery over 10 years
Short leasehold  property alterations over 10 years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment over 5 years
On 1 April 2002, the expected useful lives of short leasehold property alterations and plant and
machinery were revised from 5 to 10 years. As a result of the change, the depreciation charge for the
year has been reduced by  96,295.
Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in overseas currencies are translated into sterling at the rate
of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.  Individual transactions are translated at the rate of exchange
ruling on the date of transaction.  All exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account.
