CORPORA PLC 
 
Chairman's Statement 
Year ended 30 June 2005 
___________________________________________________________________ 
Introduction  
Corpora is a world leader in the development of text analysis software solutions that tackle 
'information overload' and accelerate understanding of textual information. The company's 
objective is to simplify the working life of people who have to read and understand increasing 
volumes of text in today's information-rich world.  
Corpora develops and sells a suite of unique natural language processing solutions that help 
people locate, analyse and employ the knowledge within text documents. Each product has 
at its core Corpora's patented linguistic processing engine that is able to read text and 
extract its meaning.  
This human-like  understanding of language is employed within a variety of solutions that 
automate a range of typical reading tasks. The Corpora suite of products can understand the 
underlying events and sentiment of hundreds of news stories, create accurate summaries of 
a number of large documents, or create a complete index of the contents of one or more 
documents. 
The company's document reading tools enable knowledge workers to reduce the time taken 
to read documents and extract the knowledge they need to do their jobs. By lightening the 
heavy load of reading, the software helps to increase the speed, accuracy and productivity of 
a modern knowledge workforce. 
Corpora's software supports people in diverse, and geographically dispersed, information 
rich organisations and markets including Government and Public Sector, Energy, Finance, 
Engineering, Legal, Pharmaceutical, Healthcare, e-Publishing and Defence. 
Corpora's products help our clients extract new value from their existing investments in 
Information Systems such as document management systems, content management 
systems, search engines and intranets. 
The Corpora product suite comprises the following: 
Jump! 
Jump! creates an easy to use index, known as a navigation tree, of the entire contents of 
large documents such as contracts, RFPs and reports. The index shows the terms (nouns), 
and their various contexts (verbs) to allow users to navigate directly to the people, 
companies, objects and events they require information about. Each sentence in the 
navigation tree hyperlinks back to the same sentence within the source document and the 
user can navigate multiple documents in different formats simultaneously (Microsoft Word, 
Adobe PDF & HTML). Users can annotate their Jumped documents and share them with 
colleagues.   
Summarize! 
Summarize! creates accurate summaries of long text documents at the click of a button. 
These summaries can be of any length to meet the user's needs, and they can be skewed

using key words towards a particular area of interest using Corpora's unique, patented 
targeted summary  feature. Summarize! helps provide improved meta tagging within existing 
Content Management systems. Summarize! cuts research times, accelerates 
responsiveness and reduces print spend. 
Find! 
Find! is a more accurate, more scalable and more secure enterprise search engine. Find! 
searches local and online files intelligently via a  learning spider' offering more accurate 
results. Find! provides maximum security by separating document access control from 
administration of the search engine. Find! employs a unique cellular architecture that makes 
it a scalable solution which will work on a single PC, or in an enterprise-wide deployment.  
Connect!  
Connect! is a collaboration platform which integrates advanced search and expertise-location 
solutions to lets users create communities to address business objectives and support them 
with tools that find, store and share information and expertise. 
Burst> 
Burst> clusters news articles into discrete events to provide news analysts with an instant 
overview of the key events, vastly accelerating news analysis. Burst> also provides named 
entity extraction to show users instantly what people, places and organisations are 
mentioned in the news. 
Sentiment> 
Sentiment> is a cutting edge natural language processing system that reads news articles to 
determine if coverage is positive, negative or neutral. This provides news analysts and 
investors with instant understanding of large volumes of news - without reading. 
In summary, Corpora has created unique, world leading technologies that meet a proven and 
growing demand to reduce text information overload. Gartner predicts the worldwide KM 
tools segment to grow to $5.04bn by 2008.  
Corpora is successfully creating a customer base for our solutions within both Europe and 
the United States. 
Secondary Placings 
 
The Group raised  250,000 in December 2004 following a brief restructuring of its cost 
base. 
 
In March 2005 the Group secured a draw-down funding facility of US$10,000,000 in 
anticipation of potential acquisitions and working capital requirements. This facility 
remains available to the Group without obligation for a further two year period.

In April 2005 the Group successfully placed  3,000,000 of ordinary shares with 
institutional investors. These funds were raised in anticipation of continuing working 
capital demands, specifically to improve and grow sales and marketing activity both in 
Europe and in the United States. 
Acquisitions  
 
On 6
th
 August 2004 we acquired Brighton based Algorithmix Limited for  483,571. 
Located at the University of Sussex Technology Centre Algorithmix is one of the UK's 
leading developers of language interpretation software. They make advanced text 
processing software, using artificial intelligence techniques. This technology has been 
successfully integrated into the Corpora product suite and key personnel at Algorithmix 
now form the core of our algorithmic development team. 
Results  
We are delighted to be able to announce an increase in revenues of 287% and a reduced 
loss per share (excluding goodwill) of 6.0p (2004: 11.0p) during the period, and a basic 
loss per share of 11.5p (2004: 16.1p). Revenues of  1,930,101, were nearly 4 times 
prior year revenues and demonstrate a strong improvement in the groups' performance 
as people and products have been integrated into one coherent sales-led organisation. 
EBITDA loss of  2,421,500 (2004:  1,677,645) reflects the impact of acquisitions in 
2004 and 2005 including the integration of previously acquired technologies into the 
Corpora product suite. This EBITDA loss is stated after charging non-recurring acquisition 
integration costs and abortive acquisition costs totaling  269,832, and a share scheme 
charge of  51,464. The operating loss for the year was  4,665,855 (2004:  2,542,063). 
Going forward the Group is well placed to increase sales and begin to generate cash. 
Dividend  
No dividends have been declared for the year ending 30 June 2005.  
Board changes  
During the year two changes were made to the Board, reflecting the continued 
development of the company. 
Daniel Wajzner joined the Board as Chief Technology Officer and has performed well in 
turning the research and development department into a sales delivery and support 
team.  
Current trading  
Our marketing efforts this year have paid dividends and we now have a healthy pipeline 
of current and potential software customers. We have several significant sales confirmed 
and further large deals approaching conclusion about which we will make further 
announcements to shareholders in due course.
