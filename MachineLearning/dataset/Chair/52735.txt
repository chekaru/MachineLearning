Chairman and 
Chief Executive' s Statement
Offshore Area 1 concession 
and the first of a planned 
minimum four-well programme 
for 2010 being drilled by the 
Belford Dolphin drill ship. 
Anadarko Petroleum 
Corporation (Anadarko ), 
the operator of the Rovuma 
Offshore Area 1 concession 
commented on the 
Windjammer Discovery 
that it was true rank wildcat 
exploration and that to have 
the first deepwater exploration 
well result in a discovery was 
an excellent indication of 
the potential of the basin . 
Anadarko also suggested 
that the Windjammer 
Discovery had de-risked 
a substantial portion of 
approximately 50 leads and 
prospects that are identified 
across the 2.5 million acre 
position in this Rovuma 
Offshore Area 1 concession.
Having suspended the 
Windjammer well the 
Belford Dolphin drilling rig 
was moved to the Collier 
prospect. Due to high pore 
pressures, Collier was 
suspended in April 2010 
for safety reasons, pending 
further evaluation of the 
conditions and well design, 
to return and achieve the 
drilling objectives at a 
later date.
Cove Strategy
The new Board has 
implemented a strategy 
focusing on opportunities 
in young geological basins 
with evidence of a working 
petroleum system with 
at least some of the 
following criteria:
   seismic de-risked 
prospects
   emerging basin preference 
that offer better terms, 
bigger prospects
   joint ventures with good 
operators
   material prospects 
   running room 
Rovuma Offshore Area 1, 
Mozambique fulfils all these 
attributes. It is a frontier 
petroleum province as no 
deepwater wells have been 
drilled off East Africa, let alone 
Mozambique. In Anadarko we 
have a highly regarded and 
expert operator and partner; 
the partnership is also 
enhanced with Bharat 
Petroleum and Videocon 
from India and Mitsui from 
Japan. These latter partners 
have long-term ambitions 
to discover and monetise 
hydrocarbon production 
into their home markets.
The first well in the Rovuma 
Onshore block, Mecupa-1 was 
drilled in Q4 2009. Although 
the well has been abandoned 
it did encounter significant 
gas shows and excellent 
quality sandstone reservoirs 
and is therefore encouraging 
for future onshore exploration. 
Both licence blocks in 
Mozambique are extensive, 
with the Rovuma Onshore 
concession covering 3.7 million 
acres and the Rovuma Offshore 
Area 1 concession totalling 
2.5 million acres. These large 
licence footprints allow the 
respective partnerships running 
room  to expand exploration 
activities outboard of discoveries 
and to derive the benefit of 
these large licence areas.
Summary
   2009 was a transformational 
and highly successful year for 
Cove Energy plc 
   High impact exploration drilling

Transformation and Success
2009 was a transformational 
and highly successful year for 
Cove Energy plc (Cove ). 
The Company, formerly called 
Lapp Plats plc, emerged in 
July 2009 following Board 
changes, a placing of 
 4.2 million and a change 
of name to Cove Energy plc 
reflecting a new oil and gas 
strategy. Our mission to 
utilise our expertise to focus 
on geologically attractive 
opportunities led to the 
identification of and decision 
to acquire interests in a number 
of oil and gas assets from 
Artumas Group Inc. ( Artumas ) 
in October 2009.
The completion of the Artumas 
Transaction has propelled the 
Company forward through 
the acquisition of proven gas 
resources in Tanzania and 
an active high impact 
deepwater drilling campaign 
offshore Mozambique. 
Our confidence and enthusiasm 
for the latent value in these 
assets was supported by a 
wide range of institutional 
and private investors, resulting 
in a  42 million placing of new 
equity in October 2009. This 
fund raising not only financed 
the acquisition costs but also 
provided sufficient working 
capital for the respective joint 
venture partnerships through 
to the end of 2010 and in 
particular, the deepwater 
drilling programme planned 
for Rovuma Offshore Area 1, 
Mozambique. The potential of 
this asset was confirmed with 
the discovery of more than 
555ft of natural gas pay in 
Windjammer, the first well 
to be drilled in the Rovuma  Cove Energy plc (formerly Lapp Plats plc)  03

Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Results for Year
We report a pre-tax loss of 
US$1,648,025 (2008: loss 
US$546,923) for the year 
ended 31 December 2009. 
The Company is well funded 
and in a strong financial position 
to finance its obligations in 
2010. In addition, the Company 
raised additional capital 
in March 2010 totalling 
 25.7 million, before 
expenses, which provides 
additional working capital to 
sustain all current obligations 
into calendar year 2011.
Management
We set out an objective to 
run Cove as an efficient, cost 
effective entity and to date, 
the day to day management 
of the Company and our 
efforts in executing the 
detailed transactional work 
which was involved in the 
Artumas deal, along with the 
related corporate events, 
have been achieved by a 
small dedicated and focused 
management group.
It is the Company's intention 
to maintain this lean structure 
and to contract-in expertise 
over the various disciplines 
from the experienced pool of 
professionals we work with.
Corporate Governance
The Board of Cove 
is constantly aware of 
the importance of sound 
corporate governance and 
it has established structures, 
so far as is practicable, 
given the Company's size, 
to comply with the best 
practice principles of the 
Combined Code, as modified 
by the recommendations of 
the Quoted Companies Alliance.
The Directors have established 
an Audit Committee to receive 
and review reports from 
management and from the 
auditors relating to the interim 
and annual accounts and to 
the system of internal financial 
controls. The Directors have 
also established a Remuneration 
Committee which determines 
the terms and conditions of 
service of Executive Directors 
and is responsible for reviewing 
their performance and for 
determining the payment of 
any bonuses or the grant 
of any share options. As the 
Board has increased in size 
over the past five months 
all these committees are 
moving to a situation where 
they will comprise only 
Non-executive Directors.
The Directors are required 
to comply with Rule 21 of 
the AIM Rules, relating to 
Directors' and applicable 
employees' dealings in the 
Company's securities and 
to this end the Company 
has adopted an appropriate 
share dealing code.
The appointment of 
Frank Moxon last December 
and of Dr Stephen Staley 
in February 2010, as 
Non-executive Directors 
has greatly assisted the 
development of our 
governance process. 
Future Plans and Prospects
In early May 2010, in Rovuma 
Offshore Area 1, the Belford 
Dolphin set top casing on the 
Barquentine prospect, near 
the Windjammer discovery. 
It has now commenced 
drilling operations on the 
Ironclad prospect, located 
in the southern section of the 
3D seismic area. Following 
the completion of Ironclad, 
the drillship will return and 
complete the drilling 
on Barquentine. 
The original drilling 
commitment for Rovuma 
Offshore was to drill four 
deepwater and three shallow 
water wells. Following the 
success at Windjammer the 
offshore partners requested 
the Mozambique authorities to 
change the drilling commitment 
to six deepwater wells. This 
request has been granted. 
Drilling of these six deepwater 
wells will continue in 2010 
through to 2011 and 
will be followed by an 
appraisal programme.
In Tanzania we are 
working with our partners 
to commercialise the full 
gas production potential 
of the Mnazi Bay gas fields. 
Proposals in this regard have 
been circulated and in the 
coming months plans will 
be developed by the partners 
to further exploit the proven 
gas reserves.
The efforts of the Board and 
management of Cove are 
focused on delivering value 
from our existing portfolio 
of proven hydrocarbon assets 
and exploration activities. 
In addition, we are devoting 
significant management 
resources to secure new 
licence and acquisition 
opportunities. 
Conclusion
Reviewing 2009, we are 
very pleased with the speed 
and execution of our planned 
strategy. Our initial fund 
raising in July 2009, gave 
Cove the structure and 
funding to negotiate and 
participate in the Artumas 
Transaction. Our ability to 
fund our share of the option 
payments to Artumas in July 
and August 2009, was key in 
enabling us to secure direct 
participation in the Tanzanian 
and Mozambique licences and 
to provide the platform from 
which we are now growing. 
That this was achieved in 
less than nine months is a 
testament to the abilities 
of the Board and to the 
professionals in our team. 
We are pleased to have 
brought the Company from 
concept to a genuine oil and 
gas explorer in a very short 
period and to be giving our 
shareholders direct exposure 
to a dynamic and already 
successful, continuing drilling 
campaign in East Africa. 
We would like to thank 
all those that have made 
this possible.
