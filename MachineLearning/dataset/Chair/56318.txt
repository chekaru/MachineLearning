DARTGROUP PLC
Chairman's Statement
I am pleased to report on the
Group's trading for the year ended
31 March 2006.
Profit before tax, goodwill
amortisation and exceptional
items, amounted to  14.7m
(2005 -  13.9m). Profit before tax
amounted to  15.0m (2005 -  8.4m).
Turnover was  319.6m (2005 -
 268.0m). Earnings per share before
the amortisation of goodwill and
exceptional items were 28.90p (2005 -
27.96p), whilst basic earnings per
share were 32.26p (2005 - 16.32p).
The Board is recommending a final
dividend of 5.18p (2005 - 4.70p),
taking the total dividend for the year
to 7.43p (2005 - 6.74p), an increase
of 10.2%. The dividend, if approved,
will be payable on 18 August 2006 
to shareholders on the register on 
23 June 2006.
During the year, the Group acquired
three Boeing 757-200 aircraft and a
further Boeing 737-300 series Quick
Change aircraft. In total, capital
expenditure amounted to  48.7m
(2005 -  51.6m). As at 31 March 2006
the Group's net debt amounted to
 5.5m (net cash at 31 March 2005 of
 2.4m). Gearing as at 31 March 2006
was 9% (2005 - ungeared).
In excess of 80% of the 2006/07
Jet2.com fuel requirements have been
hedged at average rates lower than the
current market price. A small amount 
of fuel has been hedged in respect of
the 2007/08 requirement. Neither
Jet2.com's contract charter operations
nor Fowler Welch-Coolchain currently
has any material exposure to oil price
risk as this is substantially covered in
their commercial contracts.
The net exceptional credit of  0.8m
comprises the profit on the sale of 
the Benair companies of  3.7m, offset
by the cost of ceasing Airbus A300
Eurofreighter  night freight
operations, together with a provision
for relocating key operational
departments from Bournemouth
International Airport to Leeds Bradford
International Airport.
On 15 August 2005 the Company
transferred its share listing from the
main market of the London Stock
Exchange to AIM. In the light of the
significant increase in the market price
of the Company's ordinary shares 
over recent years, we are proposing to
split the ordinary shares into four. We
believe that this will make the ordinary
shares more marketable, particularly for
the small shareholder. Subject to the
passing of the necessary shareholder
resolution at the Company's AGM to be
held on 3 August 2006, it is, therefore,
proposed that, with effect from the
close of business on 3 August 2006,
each issued and unissued ordinary
share of 5 pence in the capital of the
Company be sub-divided into four new
ordinary shares of 1.25 pence each.
Further information will be mailed to
shareholders in due course.

Annual report 2006
On 31 August 2005 the Group sold
its freight forwarding business, Benair
Freight International, and has now
entered into a contract for the sale of
its Channel Islands business, Channel
Express (CI) Limited. Following the
completion of this sale, which is
dependent on Jersey regulatory
approval, the Company's business
will comprise Jet2.com, the scheduled
low-cost airline based in the North of
England, and Fowler Welch-Coolchain,
our UK specialist temperature-
controlled distribution business which
has recently been enlarged by the
acquisition of the business and assets of
R F Fielding Cheshire Limited, whose
main business of non temperature-
controlled distribution is based in
Stockport, Greater Manchester.
The activities of the trading companies
are more fully described in the Review
of Operations that follows this
statement on pages 6 to 9.
Jet2.com
Jet2.com now flies to 26 destinations
from six bases in the North of England,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. The
company also operates night time mail
services with six Quick Change  and
one freighter Boeing 737-300 aircraft
for Royal Mail and has an important
passenger charter programme. The
company's main operating base is
Leeds Bradford International Airport
and the decision has been taken to
relocate the majority of the operational
infrastructure, from our current offices
in Bournemouth, to Leeds Bradford.
This is a major undertaking and change
for the many people affected. I am
pleased to say that the majority of the
company's senior management and
about one third of other staff will 
make the move. The recruitment and
training of replacements is obviously 
a considerable task and we are
extremely grateful for everyone's help
and determination to make the
transition a success.
Jet2.com currently operates 22 Boeing
737-300 aircraft, which carry 148
passengers, and three larger Boeing
757-200s, which carry 235 passengers.
The Boeing 757 enables us to fly more
passengers at a lower seat cost on our
more popular routes and also to fly to
more distant winter sun destinations.
We expect to increase both fleets over
the coming year.
Jet2.com aims to offer the lowest
possible fares to its holiday, city break
and business destinations but also to
give a welcoming on-board service
which is enhanced by allocating 
seats at check-in. Ancillary revenues,
including commissions from hotels, 
car hire, etc., sold through the website
and through on-board sales are an
important source of income and are
continually being developed.
With the growing propensity for people
to own overseas properties, take more
frequent holidays and leisure breaks in
exciting and attractive European cities
and probably to retire to sunnier
climes, we believe that there is huge
potential growth in the leisure air 
travel market.
Jet2.com is now one of the most
recognised air travel brands in the
North of England and we are well
positioned to successfully grow
this business.
Fowler Welch-Coolchain
The Group's temperature-controlled
distribution company, Fowler Welch-
Coolchain, had an encouraging year
with increased sales and profits. The
improvement in sales was a reflection
of new chilled distribution business 
for a number of the UK's major
supermarkets and growth in the
company's warehousing, storage and
picking operations in both Teynham,
Kent, and Spalding, Lincolnshire. In
addition to the fresh produce and
chilled distribution business, in
Teynham up to 150,000 cases per 
week of cheese and pasta are being
picked and despatched, whilst in
Spalding the prepared meats business
has now reached 375,000 cases per
week. Considerable effort is constantly
made to minimise operational costs 
and increase network distribution
efficiencies by ensuring that vehicles 
are efficiently utilised between the
company's sites. Pleasingly, one of 
the major constraints on growth in 
the distribution business - a shortage 
of qualified drivers - is receding
as well-qualified personnel from
Eastern Europe are becoming
increasingly available.

DART GROUP PLC
Chairman's Statement
continued
Subject to Jersey regulatory approval,
the Group's Channel Islands distribution
business has been sold. The Channel
Islands business was no longer seen 
as core and this disposal frees up
management time and resources to
concentrate on developing our UK
distribution operations.
On 28 April 2006, the business and
assets of R F Fielding Cheshire Limited
(In Administration) were acquired. 
This company offered warehousing 
and distribution of non temperature-
controlled goods and is primarily
based in Stockport, Greater
Manchester, where it had 160,000 sq ft
of specialist warehouse premises. It was
a well-established business with a good
client base of customers similar to 
those of Fowler Welch-Coolchain. 
The company had run into financial
difficulties and our management saw
the opportunity to acquire the
business and assets at an attractive
price from the Administrator and to
profitably incorporate the operation
into the Fowler Welch-Coolchain
network. This acquisition should
contribute in excess of  15m of
turnover in ambient distribution in the
2006/07 financial year and will give
further opportunities both to increase
the company's lorry fleet loaded miles
and to drive down costs as a result of
increased network efficiencies.
Fowler Welch-Coolchain has extensive
temperature-controlled, warehousing
and distribution facilities in Spalding
and Teynham with a new distribution
centre expected to come on stream 
in the north east of England, later this
financial year. The new facilities of 
R F Fielding Cheshire Limited in the
North West will further enhance
the company's service levels and
competitiveness. We expect further
progress to be made in Fowler Welch-
Coolchain in the new financial year,
with growth being seen in all the
business segments - temperature-
controlled distribution, ambient
distribution and warehousing
operations.
Our staff
Change is always unsettling and
the relocation of Jet2.com to Leeds
Bradford is a considerable challenge 
for all concerned. I believe we have
made every effort with our relocation
packages and general assistance to give
those that wish to make the move all
possible encouragement. Obviously,
there are many who, for family and
other reasons, will be unable to relocate
and will, therefore, be leaving us. We
are very grateful to everyone for their
contributions in the past that have
brought us to our current position. 
We look forward to the exciting
opportunities which our northern 
base brings to those who relocate and
our new colleagues who join us.
We also welcome the staff of 
R F Fielding Cheshire Limited to 
Fowler Welch-Coolchain. We have 
been very pleased by the enthusiasm
with which they have embraced the
recent changes and believe that
together we can build an increasingly
successful distribution business.
Outlook
I am more confident than ever for the
continued growth of the Group. Of
course, each of the separate businesses
is in very competitive sectors. However,
I believe we have the expertise,
management, staff and assets to
be increasingly successful in each.
Current trading is in line with our
budget and expectations.
