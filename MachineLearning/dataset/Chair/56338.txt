DART GROUP PLC
Chairman's Statement
I am pleased to report on the 
Group's trading for the year ended 
31 March 2007.
Profit before tax, goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items, amounted to
 16.6m (2006 -  14.5m restated). 
Profit before tax and after goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items
amounted to  18.1m (2006 -  14.8m
restated). Turnover was  352.0m 
(2006 -  310.6m restated). Earnings per
share before the amortisation of goodwill 
and exceptional items were 8.78p 
(2006 - 7.11p restated), whilst 
basic earnings per share were 9.73p
(2006 - 7.95p restated). The Board 
is recommending a final dividend of
1.430p (2006 - 1.295p), taking the 
total dividend for the year to 2.08p
(2006 - 1.86p), an increase of 12%. 
The dividend, if approved, will be payable
on 24 August 2007 to shareholders on
the register on 6 July 2007. The lower tax
charge of 25% is as a result of the largely
tax free gain on the Channel Islands'
business disposal together with a number
of prior year tax credits, both these events
are unlikely to re-occur in the future.
In total, capital expenditure amounted
to  71.8m (2006 -  48.7m), and
mainly related to the acquisition of 
five Boeing 757-200 aircraft, spare
engines and the Group's spending on
capitalised aircraft maintenance. As at
31 March 2007 the Group's net debt
amounted to  14.1m (2006 -  5.5m).
Gearing as at 31 March 2007 was 20%
(2006 - 9%).
In excess of 72% of the 2007/08
Jet2.com fuel requirements have been
hedged for the year ending 31 March
2008, together with 100% of the
forecast US$ requirements. Neither
Jet2.com's contract charter operations
nor Fowler Welch-Coolchain currently
has any material exposure to oil price
risk as this is substantially covered in
their commercial contracts.
The Group completed the sale of its
non-core Channel Islands' distribution
business on 3 July 2006. The
exceptional credit of  2.2m relates to
the surplus of proceeds over book cost. 
Jet2.com 
Jet2.com, the Group's low-cost airline,
expanded its operations from each of
its six Northern UK bases during the
year. The move of the administration
and operational offices to Leeds
Bradford International Airport was
substantially completed and the
Group's owned fleet increased to 
29 aircraft with the addition of the 
five Boeing 757-200 aircraft. Leased-in
aircraft have also been operated to
meet seasonal demand.
Jet2.com's aim is to be the leading
supplier of scheduled leisure flights
from the North and the brand is
aggressively promoted to achieve 
the public's recognition, via on-line
advertising, press, posters, TV and
radio. During the year the number of
destinations served increased to 38 for
summer 2007 (2006 - 31). Passengers
carried are forecast to rise to 4.3m
compared to 3.0m in the year ended
31 March 2007. The Company also
operates night-time mail flights on
behalf of Royal Mail and many series
and individual charter flights for a
diverse customer base.
In the autumn of 2006 the Company
commenced services to The Canary
Islands from Leeds Bradford,
Manchester, Newcastle, Belfast and
Blackpool utilising Boeing 757 aircraft.
During the winter of 2007/08 up to 
27 services a week will be flown to
Tenerife, Gran Canaria and Lanzarote. It
is also planned to introduce other year
round sun destinations. The Company's
policy is to offer the lowest possible
fares throughout its network. The
revenue from these is supplemented
with value-added ancillary revenue
streams such as commission on sales of
insurance, hotels and car hire together
with the profits on sales of in-flight
food, drink and gifts. The associated
revenues per passenger for the 
current year are forecast to increase
considerably over that achieved in 
the last financial year.
In February 2007, Jet2holidays.com
was launched to offer flexible duration
flight, transfers and hotel packages
linked, primarily, to our scheduled
services. Whilst this is a highly
competitive market, we believe that 
by packaging attractive hotels with 
our low fares we can give our leisure
customers great value holidays. The
concept is currently being marketed 
on a limited basis whilst the mechanics
of the process are developed. However,
we are pleased that the customer
experience has proven good and 
we look forward to putting full
promotional spend behind the product
for the next year.
Jet2.com aims to expand its business 
by serving traditional leisure markets 
at highly competitive prices and
developing a range of longer distance
low-cost services that meet the
aspirations of leisure travellers.
Obviously routes take time to develop
and costs are incurred in building
volumes and taking market share. 
We will be continuing investment in

new routes over the coming year so
profit growth in this area of our
business is likely to be flat.
Fowler Welch-Coolchain
The Group's logistics company, Fowler
Welch-Coolchain, made considerable
progress in the last financial year with
new business wins, increased sales 
and improved profits. The Company
primarily provides an integrated 
supply chain solution to supermarkets
and their suppliers as well as food
manufacturers, growers and importers.
Capabilities include both chilled and
ambient (non temperature-controlled)
distribution together with warehousing
and pick-to-order services. The
Company's warehousing and picking
operations, which feed the distribution
network, continue to expand with
substantial new business wins at both
Kent and Spalding sites during the 
year. Volume is important to the
business to increase the load fill 
of the distribution vehicles.
On 28 April 2006, Fowler Welch-
Coolchain acquired the business and
assets of R F Fielding Cheshire Ltd (In
Administration), for a de minimis sum.
This business specialises in ambient
distribution from its base in North 
West England. Employee numbers
amounted to 226 and the business
utilised 79 tractor units and 133 trailers.
It is operated from a 187,500 sq.ft
leased premises in Stockport. Not 
only has this acquisition provided a
foothold in this larger market, it has
also improved the utilisation of the
transport fleet via network synergies. 
A 40,000 sq.ft. freehold facility on an 
8 acre site was acquired in Washington,
Tyne and Wear, on 4 September 2006.
This facility replaced the Company's
existing premises in Gateshead and 
is being fitted out for temperature-
controlled storage and distribution. 
It will provide the North East England
platform for growth in both the
Company's chilled and ambient
business.
It is the Company's strategy to invest
and grow its chilled and ambient
distribution and warehousing businesses
by a combination of organic growth
and selective acquisition. 
Our Staff
The relocation of Dart Group's 
and Jet2.com's operational and
administrative headquarters to Leeds
Bradford International Airport has 
now been substantially completed 
and I am extremely grateful to the
majority of the key staff who have
made the move and ensured that 
the Companies' operations have
continued seamlessly.
We will be sorry to lose our Group
Finance Director, Mike Forder, in July
and thank him for his substantial
contribution to the Group's
development. 
However, we are very pleased to
welcome his successor, Andrew
Merrick, FCMA, who joins us on 
2 July from Bradford & Bingley PLC
where he was Director of Finance.
Before, from 1988 to 1997, Andrew
had a successful career at Thomas 
Cook Group where he undertook a
number of operational finance roles.
Prior to this Andrew worked for the
international division of Midland Bank
Limited. Andrew will bring valuable
banking and travel industry experience
to the Group.
It is important to acknowledge the
dedication and hard work of each 
of the Group's operational and
administrative staff in both Fowler
Welch-Coolchain and Jet2.com. Both
businesses are customer-focused and
operationally demanding at all hours of
the day. We are grateful to all and look
forward to continuing to grow our
business together.
Outlook
We expect to grow both our businesses
organically in the year ahead, with also
the possibility of selective acquisitions
in Fowler Welch-Coolchain when there
are sensibly priced opportunities. 
In the competitive scheduled low-cost
travel market, which is becoming
progressively later booking and therefore
more difficult to predict, whilst our 
235 seat Boeing 757s differentiate our
product and capabilities from several 
of our competitors, new routes still 
take time and money to develop to
profitability. However, the consolidation
of the major tour operators, who
currently have large capacity to many
of the destinations we also serve,
should give real opportunities both 
for our scheduled business and
Jet2holidays.com. Therefore, overall,
whilst I believe it is unlikely that the
Group's profits will increase this year,
growth should resume thereafter.
