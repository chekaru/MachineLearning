Chairman'sStatement
Babraham Research Campus
SpeedDeck Building Systems
Iampleased to present my statement for the year ended
30 June 2006, including the review of our business activities
and the outlook for the current year .
Performance summary for the year 
Group turnover for the year was  55,197,000 (2005:
 48,018,000), an increase of 15.0 per cent. Group operating
profit was 51.5 per cent. higher at  4,059,000 (2005:
 2,680,000). Group operating profit is after goodwill
amortisation costs for the year of  744,000 (2005:  339,000).
Profit on ordinary activities before tax, after net interest
payable of  156,000 (2005:  231,000), was  4,379,000 (2005:
 2,325,000), an increase of 88.3 per cent.
Group profit for the year after tax was  3,293,000 (2005:
 2,083,000) equivalent to 6.7p per share(2005: 4.3p per share),
an increase of 58.1 per cent. The reduced tax charge again
reflects the benefit of utilising brought forwardlosses for which
no deferred tax asset was previously recognised.
Operating cash flow was again strong and net funds in hand at
30 June 2006 increased to  4,682,000 compared with total net
funds in hand at 30 June 2005 of  176,000.
We continue to invest significantly in new products and
enhanced softwaredevelopment and the above results were
achieved after incurring  1,281,000 of research and
development expenditure(2005:  1,254,000).
The Company's performance in the year under review as
measured by the above key performance indicatorsis again
most encouraging.
Dividends
The Boardproposes an increased final dividend of 1.50p per
share(2005: 1.00p per share), which subject to approval by
shareholders, will be paid on 8December, 2006 to shareholders
on the Register on 17 November, 2006.
This, together with the interim dividend of 0.60p already paid,
would result in total dividends for the year ended 30 June 2006
of 2.10p per share(2005: 1.40p per share), an increase of 50.0
per cent.
Review of Business Activities
Eleco Building Systems
Turnover of the Building Systems operations increased by 14.7
per cent. to  48,544,000 (2005:  42,333,000). The operating
profit increased by 42.3 per cent. to  5,361,000 (2005:
 3,768,000).
The Building Systems operations areprincipally concerned with
the design and supply of engineered building components,
manufactured offsite in precast concrete, metal and timber in
the UK. It is also involved in the provision of timber engineering
systems in the UK, Germany and South Africa, through the
supply of design and CADCAM software, related support
services and components used in the product manufacturing
process.
Eleco Precast 
Bell &Webster Concrete experienced a strong resurgence in
profits owing to continuing strong demand for its FastBuild
Rooms for hotels and student accommodation projects.
Including the supply of nearly 1,300 rooms for student
accommodation at the University of East London, and Brunel
University,it increased its sales of these products, which
accounted for more than 80 per cent. of its turnover.Demand
for its terracing, retaining wall and ground beam products also
remained firm.
The business has strengthened its management team during
the year and is actively developing new products to add to its
range.
Eleco EngineeredBuilding Products
The roofing and cladding businesses,comprising SpeedDeck
Building Systems,Prompt Profiles and Downer Cladding
Systems,again produced acreditable performance by
increasing profits over the previous year in adifficult market
environment.
Eleco Timber Frame increased the market penetration of its
patented ElecoFrame  system, despite the business being
subject to disruption owing to its relocation into alternative
factory premises during the year.Stramit Industries benefited
from increased sales of ElecoFloor , its patented acoustic
flooring product, partly as aconsequence of demand generated
by increased sales of ElecoFrame.
ElecoFrame was one of four products short-listed for the Offsite
Product of the Year awardat Interbuild 2006 in Birmingham
earlier this year and ElecoFloor was named Product of the Year
at The Building Show 2006 in Dublin. Given the intense
competition for these industry awards, the technical design
teams directly involved in the development of these products
are to be congratulated on their outstanding achievement.
From the end of the financial year,Eleco Timber Frame and
Stramit Industries werecombined to trade as Eleco Building
Components.
Eleco Timber Engineering Systems
Eleco Timber Engineering Systems consists of Gang-Nail
Systems in the UK, Eleco Bauprodukte in Germany and
International Truss Systems in South Africa.
Gang-Nail Systems produced higher profits despite the impact
of higher steel prices and the restrictions on steel availability
owing to intense demand. In the UK, we aremerging our
specialist timber engineering softwareand consultancy activity,
which principally supports the timber frame industry,and 3
Gang-Nail Systems.The combination will enable us to provide
an improved, co-ordinated and comprehensive service to the
full range of our timber engineering systems customers.
Eleco Bauprodukte performed well during the year,maintaining
its level of sales and improving profitability despite market
conditions remaining difficult.
International Truss Systems,having already established itself as
amajor contributor to the Group'sprofits,delivered another
outstanding performance.
Eleco Construction Software
Turnover of our Construction Softwareoperations increased by
17.0 per cent. to  6,653,000 (2005:  5,685,000). While the
headline operating loss was  1,302,000 (2005:  1,088,000) the
operating loss beforegoodwill charges was somewhat lower
then the previous year at  590,000 (2005:  782,000) and
included afirst year loss from Esign of  185,000.
Disappointingly, the improvement in trading performance did
not match progress made technically.Fully expensed
development expenditureonnew and enhanced software
products rose to  858,000 (2005:  835,000).
Eleco SoftwareSweden had another steady year during which
some reorganising of the sales operations in Sweden occurred
and international sales channels for some applications were
established, the benefits from which should become apparent in
the current year.Eleco SoftwareGermany produced aprofit
compared with aloss in the previous year,benefiting from
ending previous distributor arrangements for Arcon  and
establishing new sales channels in Germany and France. The UK
softwareoperations made good progress in introducing the
StairCon application and further developed its Whole House
Engineering application, which will shortly be ready for launch.
We have made good progress at a technical level withanumber
of applications.For example, our 3D visualisation and date
compression technology has been used extensively on the
website of the prestigious Swedish Forest Industries Federation;
Esign has now established its Floor Studio software with 30 of
the leading producersof wood flooring in Germany; our latest
3D technology is being used by anumber of leading German
companies,including Mercedes Benz; Consultec successfully
launched its PDA version of SiteCon just recently in Sweden;
the latest English professional version of Arcon will be launched
this November; and meanwhile ArCon Visual Architecture
remains the leading selling product of its type in the French
retail market.
Although Eleco Construction Softwarehas achieved anumber
of technical successes and while its input and technical support
is of undoubted value to the Building Systems operations, we
have not succeeded in translating adequately the increased
turnover and technical achievements of Eleco Construction
Softwareinto a satisfactory financial performance. Iam
thereforemaking some organisational changes within Eleco
Construction Software with the objective of achieving amore
satisfactory financial outcome in the current year .
Employees
The excellent result in the year under review is due principally
to the outstanding effort, initiative and imagination of our
employees across the Group and I would like, on your behalf, to
thank them for their tremendous contribution to these results.
Outlook
Forecasts for the UK building sector do not indicate significant
growth in overall demand. However, the success of Eleco
Building Systems in recent yearshas been founded on
identifying special requirements within the build process and
developing products which match the changing patterns of
customer needs for offsite manufactured systems and products.
We will continue with our strategy of targeting the products of
the Building Systems operations to meet these requirements.
The build process increasingly demands moreadvanced and
functional softwareapplications and this also presents an
opportunity for our Construction Softwareoperations to
complement the products of our Building Systems operations.
Progress has been made by the Construction Software
operations as evidenced by the significant increase in their
market penetration in the year under review,although the
technical excellence of their product range was not reflected in
their financial performance. Akey task this year will therefore
be to ensureas far as possible that the Construction Software
operations produce amoreappropriate financial return.
I said last year that, having regard to Eleco's strong financial
position, good cash generation and the benefit to be gained
from our continuing investment in new products and software,
Ihad every confidence in the futureof the Eleco Group. This
year Eleco is in a stronger financial position, its cash generation
has remained strong and we have continued to invest. We also
have adedicated management team backed by an experienced
workforce. The Group has again made agood start to the year
and performance for the first quarter is ahead of the same
period last year.
I thereforecontinue to have every confidence in the futureof
Eleco.
