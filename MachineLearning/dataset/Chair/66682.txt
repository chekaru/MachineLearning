 2 Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Chairman's Statement
I am pleased to present my statement for the year ended 30 June
2007, including the review of our business activities and the
outlook for the current year.
Performance Summary
Group turnover for the year was  62,078,000 (2006:
 55,197,000), an increase of 12.5 per cent.
Group operating profit was 35.8 per cent. higher at  5,591,000
(2006:  4,1 16,000 restated). Group operating profit was arrived at
after deducting goodwill amortisation costs for the year of
 596,000 (2006:  744,000) and included a first year contribution
of  497,000 from Asta Development, which was acquired in
December 2006.
Profit on ordinary activities before tax was  5,650,000 (2006:
 4,436,000 restated), an increase of 27.3 per cent. after net
interest receivable of  59,000 (2006:  156,000 payable).
Group profit for the year after tax was  4,614,000 (2006:
 3,333,000 restated) equivalent to 8.7p per share (2006: 6.8p per
share restated), an increase of 27.9 per cent.
Operating cash flow was again strong and net funds in hand at
30 June 2007 were marginally higher at  4,760,000 (2006:
 4,682,000). It should be noted that the cash cost of financing
the acquisition Asta Development during the year was
 2,622,000 net of the cash balances acquired with that company.
We continued to invest significantly in new products and
enhanced software development during the year and such
expenditure increased to  1,963,000 (2006:  1,281,000).
The Company's performance as measured by the above key
performance indicators is again most encouraging.
Dividends
The Board proposes an increased final dividend of 1.80p per share
(2006: 1.50p per share), which subject to approval by
shareholders, will be paid on 23 November 2007 to shareholders
on the Register on 19 October 2007.
The final dividend, together with the interim dividend of 0.70p
already paid, would result in total dividends for the year ended 30
June 2007 of 2.50p per share (2006: 2.10p per share), an increase
of 19.0 per cent.
Review of Business Activities
Building Systems
In the UK, our building systems operations are principally
involved in the design, off-site manufacture and supply of
structural building components in precast concrete, metal
roofing and cladding and engineered timber products; and also in
the supply of timber engineering systems. In South Africa and
Germany we also supply timber engineering systems.
Turnover of our building systems operations increased by 6.7 per
cent. to  51,793,000 (2006:  48,544,000).
Building systems operating profit increased by 12.4 per cent. to
 6,087,000 (2006:  5,418,000 restated). Operating profit before
goodwill was  6,119,000 (2006:  5,450,000).
Precast
Bell & Webster Concrete again experienced strong demand for its
FastBuild Rooms for hotels and student accommodation projects
in the second half of the year. Demand for its retaining wall and
other products also remained firm. As a consequence, its
operating profits were significantly higher than last year.
Evidence of Bell & Webster Concrete's growing reputation for its
products and service is that it has been short listed by the
Concrete Society for its 2007 Annual Awards in the category
 New Structures . It has also been nominated for the Interbuild
Off-site Construction Awards for 2007 in the category Best use
of Concrete  in connection with the highly regarded Docklands
Student Village for the University of East London.
Engineered Building Components
Profit contributions from the roofing and cladding operations
SpeedDeck Building Systems and Downer Cladding were lower in
a difficult market. However, management has taken steps to
remedy this situation and will be launching new products at the
forthcoming Interbuild Exhibition in October. I am pleased to
report that Eleco Timber Frame made a welcome breakthrough to
profit in the second half and that orders for the ElecoFrame 
patented timber frame system continue to grow.
Timber Engineering Systems
Gang-Nail Systems was adversely affected by the atrocious wet
weather conditions experienced in the UK in the latter part of the
year. The consequent disruption to activity on building sites
affected Gang-Nail Systems' customers' ability to supply roof
trusses and Ecojoist  to those sites. In the circumstances Gang-
Nail performed well although profits for the year were marginally
lower than the record profit achieved last year.
Eleco Bauprodukte performed well in the German market and
sales and profits were significantly higher than last year.
In South Africa, International Truss Systems yet again delivered
another outstanding performance, with profits again ahead of
last year's record in sterling terms despite a somewhat weaker
Rand.
Software
Turnover of our software operations increased by 54.7per cent. to
 10,285,000 (2006:  6,653,000), of which  2,432,000 was
attributable to Asta Development, acquired in December 2006.
The operating loss of our software operations fell to  496,000
(2006:  1,302,000) after goodwill charges of  564,000 (2006:
 712,000). Fully expensed development costs were  1,379,000
(2006:  858,000).
Birmingham Super Hospital
Asta Powerproject Enterprise Software, Asta Development 3
The operating profit before goodwill of our software interests was
 68,000 (2006: loss  590,000), including the contribution of
 497,000 from Asta Development.
Construction software
The construction software interests namely, Consultec Sweden,
Consultec UK and Asta Development performed well. In
particular, the latter performed in line with our expectations at
the time of its acquisition in December 2006.
All our software operations have benefited from the adoption of
Asta Development's software management techniques and
disciplines. In particular, cross initiatives with Asta Development
have contributed to improved performance from the Consultec
companies in Sweden and the UK and I look forward to further
progress in this quarter.
Visualisation Software
ArCon  and Esign sustained operating losses due to continuing
high development costs. However, substantial increases in sales
of both products during the year were most encouraging. Since
the year end, we have completed the development of ArCon
2007, following which we have entered into a new 3 year
agreement with Micro Application, the leading French software
distributor, to continue its distribution of ArCon 3D. We are
actively negotiating agreements with distributors in 10 other
countries. We have also signed a distribution agreement to target
major UK retailers with own brand consumer software for home
improvement.
Management and Employees
I would like to take this opportunity to formally welcome Michael
McCullen, who joined the Board following the acquisition of Asta
Development, of which he is Managing Director.
I would also like to thank on your behalf the employees in the UK,
Germany, Sweden and South Africa all of whose hard work,
dedication and skill have made possible these significantly
improved results.
Our Value Proposition
The building industry has been moving progressively towards the
use of off-site manufactured structural building components for
some time.
The increasing use of design and engineering software in recent
years has also facilitated the selection of off-site manufactured
building elements, enabling them to be more accurately
dimensioned, costed and manufactured for speedy installation
when delivered to site. Visualisation software enables builders
and their clients to view projects in virtual form before building
begins and the build process itself is now normally managed by
project management software.
Our strategy is to satisfy the requirements of the construction
industry in this modern, progressive approach to the build
process and to anticipate the industry's future needs. Thus we
design and manufacture innovative and efficient building
components in precast concrete, metal and timber; we develop
and utilise the latest design and engineering software in our
manufacturing processes; and we develop for use by our
customers design and engineering software, estimating software,
visualisation software, plant management software and project
management software.
Finance
Following the recovery in the Company's fortunes over the last
decade, we have consistently applied measured financing policies
as we have moved forward. The recent turmoil in the financial
markets would seem to justify this approach and we continue to
strive to maintain a strong financial position. In this connection,
I am pleased to inform you that we recently agreed with our
bankers a significant increase in our committed medium term
banking facilities, which, together with our net cash position and
continuing strong operating cash flows, will provide significant
resources to support the expansion of the Group.
Outlook
The outlook for the major part of our operations for the year
ahead is firm, although the effect of the current turmoil in the
financial markets on those of our operations that are directly
involved in the UK housing market remains to be seen. That
said, the Prime Minister has made clear that one of his major
objectives is to bring about a step change in the construction of
affordable housing in this country and I am encouraged by the
fact that this laudable and ambitious target will be achieved
only by the increased application of those modern building
systems and technologies on which Eleco's business is based.
We finished the year with substantially higher orders and in a
strong financial position. Our products are increasingly well
regarded in the market place and we have a dedicated
management team backed by an experienced workforce. We have
also made a strong start to the current year and we will continue
our emphasis on strong cash generation in our operations. For all
these reasons, and despite the current turmoil in financial
markets, I have every confidence in the year ahead for Eleco.
