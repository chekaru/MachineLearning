Chairman's(and(Chief(Execu9ve(O cer's(Report ACQUISITION OF LEEDS SKIN 
C E N T R E F O R A P P L I E D 
RESEARCH LTD ( LEEDS SKIN')
Following a fund raise of  2 million 
(before costs) by means of the 
issue of 50,000,000 ordinary shares 
at 4 pence each, Syntopix acquired 
the entire issued share capital of 
Leeds Skin on 24 May 2011. This is 
now allowing the Group's strategy 
to evolve and our vision is to 
become the most flexible and 
responsive skin R&D company, 
capable both of developing 
products and offering laboratory 
services to the dermatological 
industry. 
Delivering clinically proven products 
t o c o s m e t i c a n d c o n s u m e r 
healthcare companies continues to 
be a priority, and the acquisition 
has now provided the Group with 
near-term revenue-generating 
technologies. This bodes extremely 
well for the long-term viability of the 
Group.
In order to reflect the strengths and 
aspirations of both Syntopix and 
Leeds Skin and re-brand the 
business, the Group was renamed 
Evocutis plc in October 2011.
COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS
The business update issued on 27 
April 2011 provided details on the 
agreements reached with several 
companies. Since that time, the 
Group has significantly improved 
the formulation of SYN1113 (for the 
treatment of acne). This compound 
has very positive clinical and 
consumer feedback data, which 
coupled with its enhanced, patent-
protected formulation now offers 
an improved opportunity for a 
commercial agreement, 
which is being actively 
pursued.
The Group continues its 
dialogue with Sinclair IS 
P h a r m a a n d w e a r e 
collaborating in the writing 
and subsequent filing of a 
patent regarding delmopinol 
and should commercialisation 
occur, Evocutis will share in the 
financial gains.
The synergistic combination of 
SYN0269 with SYN0693 is being 
considered by a partner company 
as a key antimicrobial system in a 
product for the prevention of body 
odour.  A patent application has 
b e e n s u b m i t t e d f o r t h i s 
combination.
Additionally, SYN1039 is being 
considered by a large cosmetics 
and toiletries company for inclusion 
in a product for body odour and 
discussions are underway.

con1nued LEEDS SKIN - THE BUSINESS
Leeds Skin is a company located in 
Wetherby, Yorkshire that runs an 
independent commercial testing 
facility specialising in human skin 
microbiology, living skin equivalent 
tissue culture systems, and human 
volunteer and clinical dermatology 
research. 
Leeds Skin provides laboratory 
service facilities for general 
microbiology applications and high 
quality contract research services 
a n d c o n s u l t a n c y t o t h e 
pharmaceutical, personal products 
and healthcare industries. The 
significant cell biology experience 
of Leeds Skin will complement the 
Group's microbiological expertise, 
aiding development of products. 
A key attraction was Leeds Skin's 
w o r l d l e a d i n g L i v i n g S k i n 
Equivalent tissue culture system 
technology (LabSkin ), a unique 
human equivalent skin which can 
b e u s e d t o m o d e l v a r i o u s 
properties associated with human 
skin (anti-inflammatory, anti-ageing 
etc.). 
Together, the Group will have the 
capacity to run both clinical and 
laboratory studies to make rational 
choices of active compounds and 
confirm product claims. This will 
put the Group in an extremely 
strong position to identify and 
develop products in-house to treat 
a variety of skin problems. Leeds 
Skin is a profitable company with 
an impressive, blue-chip client 
base.
Dr Richard Bojar (who was the 
founder and is a director of Leeds 
Skin) and Dr Anthony Jeremy 
remain with the company, and Dr 
Bojar has joined the Evocutis 
Board as a director and Chief 
Scientific Officer. 
The Group has now relocated and 
is based in Wetherby, benefitting 
from a facility with much more 
space and freedom to expand than 
the Group's former premises in 
Bradford. 
The microbiological expertise of 
Syntopix will be complemented by 
the cell biology expertise of Leeds 
Skin, putting Evocutis in the 
position to offer laboratory and 
clinical services. These services 
will include the detection and 
determination of antimicrobial 
compounds and product activity in 
laboratory models and clinical 
studies, as well as laboratory 
systems that model various 
properties associated with human 
skin (anti-inflammatory, anti-ageing 
etc.) to allow rational choices of 
a c t i v e c o m p o u n d s a n d 
confirmation of product claims. 
Evocutis will be able to offer a 
combination of technical expertise 
to both raw material suppliers of 
c o m p o u n d s a n d p r o d u c t 
development companies in the 
c o n s u m e r h e a l t h c a r e a n d 
pharmaceutical arenas.

con1nued MARKETS AND OPPORTUNITIES
The skin care business continues to 
grow, with anti-acne and anti-
ageing products leading the way 
(Global Industry Analysts Inc., Jan 
2011). Evocutis will be in a position 
to exploit these trends with product 
offerings and support services.
The Group continues to believe that 
there is a major global demand for 
antimicrobial compounds in the 
consumer healthcare and cosmetic 
markets. The opportunities are 
principally in the areas of acne, oral 
hygiene, hair care and deodorants. 
With a proprietary database of over 
3,200 compounds and a variety of 
laboratory and clinical services at 
its disposal, the Group believes it is 
well placed to provide innovative 
solutions to companies seeking 
antimicrobials. 
In March 2009, the EU banned the 
sale of cosmetic products tested 
on animals. In March 2013, the EU 
is going to ban the sale of any 
p ro d u c t t h a t c o n t a i n s a n y 
ingredient tested on animals (for 
the purposes of the Directive). 
Owing to the global nature of the 
cosmetic and consumer healthcare 
businesses, this is effectively a 
worldwide ban. The Group believes 
that LabSkin  offers product 
suppliers and manufacturers a 
u n i q u e l y p o w e r f u l t o o l f o r 
understanding the efficacy of their 
compounds and/or products for a 
variety of indications.  With the 
combination of LabSkin  testing 
and our Clinical and Laboratory 
facilities, we believe that Evocutis is 
in a unique position to be able to 
p r o v i d e s u p p o r t t o t h o s e 
companies wishing to innovate in 
skin science.
The key feature of LabSkin  is that 
i t c a n b e c o l o n i s e d w i t h 
microorganisms, thereby better 
reflecting true-life conditions of the 
skin surface. No other commercial 
laboratory skin model can do this. 
Additionally, LabSkin  is being 
v a l i d a t e d f o r u s e i n t h e 
understanding of compounds and 
products that are efficacious as 
anti-inflammatories and anti-ageing 
agents. The applicability of 
LabSkin  in understanding the 
action and efficacy of sunblock 
treatments will be established in 
2012.

con1nued PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
S Y N 1 1 1 3 , i n i t s p a t e n t e d 
formulation designed to enhance 
speed of penetration and efficacy, 
continues to represent the Group's 
lead opportunity for the treatment 
of acne. The formulation approach 
used for SYN1113 is being 
examined for its ability to enhance 
the speed and efficacy of delivery 
of future compounds in the 
pipeline.
SYN0693 in combination with 
SYN0117 would be the next anti-
a c n e c a n d i d a t e t o e n t e r 
d e v e l o p m e n t , s i n c e t h e 
combination has been shown to be 
synergistic and shows excellent 
pre-clinical efficacy. 
Several candidates (e.g. SYN0017 
for oral care and SYN1039 for body 
odour) are being assessed by 
various third parties and continue 
t o r e p r e s e n t p r o m i s i n g 
opportunities for products requiring  
effective antimicrobials.
The Group is evaluating the 
possibility of developing products 
for the treatment of dry skin, using 
our own internal technology 
capability for the rational design 
and testing of efficacious products. 
Progress on this front will be 
reported as and when appropriate.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Our patent portfolio continues to 
be strengthened by careful 
strategic management. The Group 
currently has 22 core families of 
patents/applications. Of these 11 
are granted in the UK and they are 
all at various stages of application 
in key territories.
After careful review, the Group has 
taken the decision not to patent the 
LabSkin  technology, preferring to 
keep the Intellectual Property as 
know-how rather than have it 
published.
OUTLOOK
The Group enters the year with a 
cash balance of  2,316,000 and is 
well placed for sustained growth.   
The technology acquired with the 
Leeds Skin business provides us 
with immediate revenue streams, 
and in the longer term potential  
product sales and/or licensing 
deals particularly in the fields of 
acne and dry skin, offering the 
prospect of excellent long-term 
growth.
