 Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period which give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the company and of the group and of the profit or loss of the group for that period. In preparing those financial
statements, the directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent
  state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group 
will continue in business
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities.

Directors' Report (continued)
FRW Annual 2004 Combined  27/4/05  9:31 am  Page 12 We have audited the group's financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 which comprise the Group Profit and Loss
Account, Group Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses, Group Balance Sheet, Company Balance Sheet, Group Statement 
of Cash Flows, and the related notes 1 to 24. These financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the accounting policies
set out therein.
This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors' report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As described in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities the company's directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial
statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United
Kingdom Auditing Standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors' Report is not consistent with the financial statements,
if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for
our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors' remuneration and transactions with the group is not disclosed.
We read the Directors' Report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements within it.
Basis of Audit Opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and
of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group's circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the group as at 31
December 2004 and of the profit of the group for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.
