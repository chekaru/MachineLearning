 Alkane Energy plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Chairman's Statement
04
2008 was a very encouraging year with Alkane's 
profi t before taxation on continuing operations 
growing 128% to  1,948,000 (2007:  853,000). 
This profi t was earned on revenue of  5,191,000 
(2007:  4,270,000) an increase of 22%, resulting 
in an earnings per share on continuing activities of 
2.17p (2007: 0.93p) up 133% on the previous year.
In 2004 Alkane changed its strategy from being a pure gas provider to utilise its gas to 
generate electricity. Since this change Alkane has achieved a 65% compound annual 
growth in revenue on its CMM business.
By year end 2008 the Company produced energy from the equivalent of 20MW of 
power generation capacity (2007: 18.5MW) and we continue to work on a large pipeline 
of projects for the future. In 2008 the Company's power plants generated 90,111MWh 
of electricity (2007: 79,670MWh). This fi gure represents a record for the Group, and in 
addition Alkane sold 3.7 million therms of gas directly to customers (2007; 4.3 million 
therms).
The electricity price has also been stronger in 2008 with the average selling price rising 
15% to  48.44/MWh (2007:  41.94/MWh). Gas sales prices have also increased to an 
average of 21.93p/therm (2007 20.54p/therm).
Costs have remained tightly controlled and Alkane retains a highly fl exible cost base 
using modular power plants which are transportable and can be scaled up or down to 
match the gas production capacity at sites within our licence portfolio. In addition the 
Company outsources a signifi cant element of the project delivery supply chain which 
makes Alkane's operations some of the most scalable and fl exible in the industry.
Financial review
Alkane has real assets on the ground producing income and positive cash fl ow. We 
will strive to maximise this cash fl ow and then use it to invest in the expansion of the 
Group's activities. Our strong fi nancial position is refl ected by the fact that we are net 
cash positive. This cash position and cash fl ow gives us a signifi cant opportunity for the 
coming year.
EBITDA from continuing operations was  2,602,000 (2007:  1,115,000) which represents 
50% of revenue. This high EBITDA margin is further evidence of the cash fl ow potential 
that underpins our strategy to exploit our licence portfolio. It is our intention to protect 
this margin by being one of the lowest cost producers in the industry. This gives us 
another defensive angle in these recessionary times.
Net interest income other than exchange gains was  112,000 compared to  90,000 in 
the previous year. The signifi cant movement in the value of the Euro during 2008 has 
resulted in an exchange gain arising from fi nancing of  495,000 (2007:  155,000). The 
majority of this gain is in respect of the working capital loan made to Pro2. The remaining 
 2,000,000 of this loan was repaid in January 2009.
Cash fl ow from operating activities was  2,200,000 (2007:  1,258,000) with  3,014,000 
invested in property plant and equipment and gas assets (2007:  875,000). Alkane's 
cash balance at 31 December 2008 was  2,176,000 (2007:  2,100,000), with net funds 
standing at  572,000 (2007:  755,000).
There were a number of one off non-trading items over the 12 months. Overall these 
items have added  537,000 to profi ts this year with the largest item being a foreign 
currency gain as the Euro strengthened against Sterling. Other non-trading profi ts 
include  350,000 from the surrender of two property leases, whilst extra costs have been 
incurred on abortive M&A activity and the impairment costs relating to carrying values. 
Excluding these items the underlying profi t before tax on continuing operations was 
 1,411,000 (2007:  889,000). On the same basis operating profi t was  1,299,000 (2007: 
 799,000).
Chairman's Statement
With the funding now in 
place and strong operating 
cash fl ow, we are well 
positioned to continue to 
exploit our CMM reserves 
and to build our generating 
capacity. We have set 
ourselves a target of reaching 
50MW of generating capacity 
over the medium term.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
During the year the Company gained Court approval to cancel the share premium 
account. This will enable the Company to consider the payment of dividends in future, 
provided that the Company remains profi table and has suffi cient resources to prudently 
meet these payments.
Board Changes
Lord Fraser of Carmyllie will retire from the Board at the Annual General Meeting of 
Shareholders to be held on 6 May 2009, following eight industrious years of service. On 
behalf of the Board I would like to thank Lord Fraser for his invaluable contribution to the 
Company during his tenure as a director and wish him well for the future.
Neil O'Brien joined the Group as Chief Executive Offi cer on 1 November 2008, replacing 
Cameron Davies who has taken up the role of Business Development Director until 
he retires from full time involvement from the Group in October of this year. Neil joins 
the Group after a successful career in a range of fi nance roles in manufacturing and 
processing businesses. For the last nine years Neil was Finance Director at Speedy Hire 
where he steered the group through an extensive period of growth.
Since Neil's arrival we have reviewed our strategic direction and are continuing to work 
on maximising operational effi ciency from the power plants we already operate as well 
as developing new capacity as quickly as possible.
 
Strategy
Alkane's business model is a simple one. We gain onshore gas licences and exploit our 
gas reserves by either selling gas directly to customers or more signifi cantly - generating 
electricity and selling this via the local electricity distribution network. We use a range 
of modular power generation units on our sites to give us the maximum fl exibility and 
scalability with an optimum operating size of up to 10MW capacity.
Our end market is the UK base load electrical demand which remains relatively stable 
even in recession but where we have seen huge swings in pricing over the past 12 
months. To manage this volatility and give us a predictable business model we use 
forward electricity contracts. This gives us visibility for the coming year without trying to 
guess future energy price movements.
Our market is the specialist clean-tech gas to power market covering methane extraction 
from CMM, landfi lls and biogas plants where we estimate we have a growing 2% market 
share. This sector of the UK gas to power market is expected to grow and we are striving 
to expand our market share over the coming years through opening new CMM power 
plants.
We are looking at acquisition opportunities in the gas to power sector but the returns 
must be comparable with the rapid pay backs and high returns that we are projecting 
from our current portfolio.
The wider renewable market is witnessing encouraging support from DECC and we will 
continue to research this sector to seek good investment opportunities. We envisage 
that our in-house gas to power expertise and our ability to react quickly to proposals will 
enable us to broaden our product offering in the coming years. The most likely areas for 
us to expand are those where we have core skills around gas handling and small scale 
power generation facilities. However it is important to retain as wide a view as possible 
and we aim to be quick to react in exploiting winning technologies in the renewable 
energy sector. If we decide to invest in new product areas we will focus on proven 
technology that matches our business model.
The industry in which we operate should strive to maximise the effi ciency and 
effectiveness of exploration and development programmes through consolidation. This 
may occur in specialising operations or building scale but cost must be taken out of both 
development and operations.
No strategy can be delivered without a good team of people. Alkane's in-house and 
sub-contract team has vast experience in this sector and has the passion to deliver 
Alkane's expansive development strategy. The Board would like to thank the team for 
all their efforts this year.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Outlook
The strategy review completed by the Board has set us on a clear path of expansion 
and we are determined to maximise the value of our reserves and use our funds to grow 
the Group over the medium term. The sale of Pro2 leaves us ungeared and in a strong 
fi nancial position to pursue our numerous growth opportunities. This is the fi rst tangible 
delivery against the strategy.
No business is immune from the recession and with funding in short supply we are 
taking a cautious view on investments and continue to keep our costs under control. The 
energy industry is already impacted by the recession and currently demand appears to 
have dropped by around 10% nationally. Pricing over the last two years has been very 
volatile refl ecting the global trend in energy commodity prices.Nonetheless, at current 
prices Alkane's operating margins are attractive and the investment case for new site 
development remains strong.
With the funding now in place and strong operating cash fl ow, we are well positioned 
to continue to exploit our CMM reserves and to build our generating capacity. We have 
set ourselves a target of reaching 50MW of generating capacity over the medium term. 
In the current year, we have several projects underway, including two currently under 
construction. Electricity sales contracted for 2009 delivery are at considerably higher 
prices than we experienced in 2008 and will have a positive effect on operating margins 
this year. The Board remains confi dent and we look forward to reporting continuing 
progress during 2009.
