Vice Chairman's review of operations
Financials
Revenue for the year ended 31 December 
2008 was US$32.8 million, 20.2% higher 
than the prior year (2007: $27.3 million) as  
a result of increased production and a higher 
average price for West Texas Intermediate 
(WTI ) crude oil. Gross production during 
2008 was 504,636 barrels of oil (bbls ) 
(2007: 478,030 bbls), with production net 
to the Company of 438,007 bbls (2007: 
413,775 bbls). Despite Lease Operating 
Expenses (LOE ) being higher primarily as a 
result of increased oil transportation costs 
and equipment rental due to drilling activity 
and new production, gross profit was 
US$17.3 million, an improvement of 25.9% 
against the prior year (2007: US$13.8 
million). Operations and general and 
administrative expenses were slightly 
increased over the prior year at US$6.3 
million (2007: US$5.8 million) due to an 
increased number of employees and 
consultants as a result of the drilling activity. 
The peak number of employees plus 
consultants in 2008 was 74 but in efforts to 
reduce costs in line with the decline in the 
oil price, the number of employees plus 
consultants now stands at 58. Operating 
profit for 2008 was, therefore, US$11.1 
million (2007: US$9.9 million), profit before 
tax was US$9.9 million (2007: US$8.9 
million) and net income was US$7.3 million 
(2007: US$7.0 million).
The Company's average operating cash 
netback per barrel, this being average sales 
less royalties and other operating costs and 
taxes, was US$35.31 against an average 
price for WTI crude oil invoiced by the 
Company of US$88.55 (2007: average 
operating cash netback per barrel US$30.44; 
average price for WTI invoiced US$72.48). 
The industry average price for WTI crude oil 
in 2008 was US$99.57, US$11.02 higher 
than the price invoiced by the Company due 
to the Company producing and selling 
approximately 59% of its 2008 net 
production in the second half of 2008 when 
oil prices were lower. The Company's 
average net wellhead price after oil transport 
and quality adjustments was US$75.90 
(2007: US$66.18).
2008 Reserve Report
The independent petroleum engineers Ralph 
E. Davis reported that, as at 31 December 
2008, proved reserves net to the Company 
totalled 64.3 million barrels of oil equivalent 
(BOE ) (as at 31 December 2007: 4.6 
million BOE), proved plus probable (2P ) 
reserves net to the Company totalled 131.0 
million BOE (as at 31 December 2007: 15.2 
million BOE) and proved plus probable plus 
possible (3P ) reserves net to the Company 
totalled 254.6 million BOE (as at 
31 December 2007: 64.9 million BOE).
The considerable increase in all the reserve 
categories has arisen predominately due to 
Ralph E. Davis re-evaluating all the historic 
data available on the Company's contract 
areas, rebasing the previously recorded 
reserves, adding in newly available data and 
then conforming exactly to the definitions of 
proved, probable and possible reserves 
approved by: Society of Petroleum Engineers 
(SPE ); World Petroleum Council (WPC ); 
American Association of Petroleum 
Geologists (AAPG ); and Society of 
Petroleum Evaluation Engineers (SPEE ). In 
addition, the Company had drilling successes 
during 2008, and lower forecasted future oil 
prices when compared to last year increased 
the time period until the Company's cost 
recovery and, therefore, the timing of 
Ecopetrol's back-in at two Colombian 
contracts. The most notable increases in 
reserves occurred within the Colombian 
Bocachico and Bolivar and Peruvian Block 95 
contracts due to the volumetric effect of 
calculating reserves at the subsurface point 
of lowest known oil based on all available 
data and analysis.
The closing WTI crude oil price as at 
31 December 2008, the date of the Reserve 
Report, was US$44.60 per barrel, an 
approximate 54% reduction against 2007 
(2007: 31 December 2007: US$95.98). 
Based upon this starting price, the Net 
Present Value at a 10% discount (NPV10 ) 
of the proved reserves was US$971 million 
(2007: US$214 million). The NPV10 of the 
2P reserves totalled US$1.5 billion (2007: 
US$641 million) and the NPV10 of the 3P 
reserves totalled US$2.3 billion (2007: 
US$2.5 billion).
Overview of Contracts and Activities
Colombia
All the Company's contracts in Colombia, bar 
the Rio Verde contract, are in the exploitation 
phase and as such do not have any significant 
pending contractual commitments and, 
therefore, only a minimal obligatory spend.

Annual Report & Accounts 2008
The Rio Verde contract area has experienced 
growth in gross production from 600 barrels 
of oil per day (bopd ) to over 1,000 bopd 
during 2008 as a result of the drilling 
success of the Boral 1 and Tilodiran 3 wells. 
New additional pay zones were also opened 
in the lower Gacheta and upper Mirador 
formations with a total of five productive 
formations having now been tested in the 
Rio Verde area: the massive Ubaque; upper 
Ubaque; lower Gacheta; upper Gacheta; and 
Mirador formations. Importantly, the Boral 1 
well demonstrated commercial hydrocarbon 
production in the new Boral prospect area to 
the east of the expanding Tilodiran field. 
Additional testing and wells are now being 
planned for both the Boral and Tilodiran field 
areas, with number and locations dependent 
on the interpretation of seismic which is 
planned to be acquired during 2009.
The Company recently accepted all the 
conditions of an amendment to the Rio 
Verde contract whereby Phases IV and V  
are collapsed into one phase ending May 
2010, therefore, substituting the need to  
drill a well by May 2009. Under the revised 
confirmed terms, by May 2010 the Company 
must now acquire approximately US$4.0 
million of mostly 3D seismic and drill an 
exploratory well.* 
The Cajaro 1 and Estero 5 wells within the 
Alcaravan contract area were shut-in during 
February 2009 due to surface mechanical 
reasons. The depressed oil price and 
prevailing LOE made these two wells as well 
as the Estero 1 & 2 wells potentially 
uneconomical. Therefore, the Company 
petitioned and received permission to 
suspend these wells temporarily. These four 
wells will be re-evaluated in the event of 
higher oil prices and ongoing initiatives to 
reduce LOE. Before they were shut-in, these 
four wells contributed approximately 280 
bopd gross together with 14,000 barrels of 
water per day.
There was no significant spend on the 
Bocachico and Bolivar contracts during 2008 
and the Company is considering options to 
realise the reserves on these contracts, one 
of which is commercial partnering.
As stated above, LOE increased in 2008 but 
LOE has now been cut by approximately 
22% from the average in the fourth quarter 
of 2008 and the further reduction of LOE is 
a high priority for the Company. Efforts are 
focused on three initiatives: the purchase of 
Colombian national grid power to replace 
site generated power which uses high-cost 
diesel fuel; the elimination of temporary field 
rental equipment; and reduction of trucking 
transport costs for oil sales by engaging oil 
purchasers in closer proximity to the Rio 
Verde contract area. These efforts are 
progressing well. In March 2009, for 
example, a contract was signed with Perenco 
as the primary buyer of the Company's oil 
due to it being a more convenient delivery 
location for the Rio Verde contract 
production, which now forms the bulk of the 
Company's daily production volumes. 
The Company continues to have an 
outstanding receivable from Ecopetrol in 
relation to the Cajaro 1 well production

dispute, currently amounting to US$4.5 million 
along with an impairment provision of US$2.4 
million. The production dispute is ongoing and 
the Company continues to expect a protracted 
process to resolve it. The Company is now 
reviewing arbitration procedures and rules and 
continues to believe it will be successful in the 
technical arbitration.
Peru
In October 2008, the Company finally 
received approval from the Peruvian Ministry 
of Energy and Mines in relation to the 
Environmental Impact Study (EIS ) at the 
Block 95 contract area. Therefore, the 
Company now has approval for its seismic 
and drilling plans related to the Bretana field 
and other nearby areas. The current 
obligations under the contract require the 
Company to have contracted for a US$2.0 
million seismic acquisition programme prior 
to the end of 2009. Contractors are being 
contacted and are expected to be available 
for the programme. 
Panama
In Panama, the location of the Company's 
only pure exploration project, the Company 
complied with the initial Phase 1 work 
commitments of the Garachine contract, 
including the mapping of a number of 
seismically defined geologic features that 
appear to be reefal in nature.
The Company is currently planning the 
magnetic studies that are required under  
the extension sought by the Company and 
previously granted by the Directorate of 
Hydrocarbons. It is the Company's intention 
to conduct these studies to better 
understand the nature of the geologic 
structures in the contract area, especially in 
regard to distinguishing between buried non 
oil-bearing volcanoes and oil-bearing 
carbonate pinnacle reefs and buildups.
Conclusion
Although the oil industry has been challenging 
of late due to the oil price decline, almost all 
commentators point to an improving price. 
The immediate focus for the Company is 
improving gross profit margins by reducing 
LOE further and using the hoped for additional 
cash flow to expand the production base. 
The Rio Verde contract will take precedence 
through 2009 with the Block 95 contract 
also building in terms of activity levels 
towards the end of the year. Several 
initiatives to realise the considerable reserve 
base will also be considered. With all these 
projects in the pipeline or already under way, 
the Company continues to make progress 
despite the current industry environment.
