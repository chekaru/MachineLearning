 Harvey Nash Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 23 22 Harvey Nash Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year. 
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent
  state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed
and explained in the financial statements
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any
time the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance of the Group's website, however, information published on
the internet is accessible in many different countries where legislation governing the preparation and dissemination
of financial statements may differ from that applicable in the United Kingdom. The work carried out by the auditors
does not involve consideration of these matters and accordingly the auditors do not accept responsibility for changes
that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
Directors' Responsibilities in Relation 
to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 January 2003 
The Harvey Nash Group plc Performance Related Share Schemes
The Performance Related Schemes are administered by the Board under the supervision of the Remuneration
Committee. The schemes are open to all full time employees except those who have had a material interest in 
the Group within the previous 12 months. The options granted under the Performance Related Scheme are not
exercisable unless Harvey Nash's earnings per ordinary share has increased at an average rate of 10% per annum
over any period of three consecutive years commencing on the date of grant of the options. The schemes' exercise
price is determined by the Board but will not be less than the average share price for the five days immediately
preceding the grant of options. The Harvey Nash Group plc Performance Related Share Plan is an Inland Revenue
Approved Scheme, however, the Board is able to grant unapproved options under the scheme. For schemes from
July 2000 the Group has obtained agreement from the employee that he or she will settle the employer's national
insurance charge in respect of any gain arising on eventual exercise. All options are granted for nil consideration.

Independent Auditors' Report to the Members of Harvey Nash Group plc
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the Profit and Loss account, the Balance Sheet, the 
Cash Flow Statement, the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses and the related notes which have been
prepared under the historical cost convention and the accounting policies set out in the statement of accounting
policies. We have also audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985
contained in the Directors' Remuneration Report ( the auditable part'). 
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
The Directors' responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in the statement of Directors' responsibilities.
The Directors are also responsible for preparing the Directors' Remuneration Report. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part of the Directors' Remuneration Report 
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom auditing standards issued by 
the Auditing Practices Board. This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company's
members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do
not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom 
this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the
financial statements and the auditable part of the Directors' Remuneration Report have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors' Report is not
consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
Directors' remuneration and transactions is not disclosed. 
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. The other
information comprises only the Financial Highlights, the Chairman's statement, the Chief Executive's Statement,
the Operating Review, the Finance Director's Review, the Directors' Report, the unaudited part of the Directors'
Remuneration Report and the Corporate Governance Statement. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the Company's compliance with the seven
provisions of the Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, 
and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board's statements on internal control
cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's or Group's corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
Basis of Audit Opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
and the auditable part of the Directors' Remuneration Report. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Company's circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements
and the auditable part of the Directors' Remuneration Report are free from material misstatement, whether caused
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the financial statements.
