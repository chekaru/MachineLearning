chairman's statement
I	am	pleased	to	report	a	further	solid	set	of	
results	for	the	year	ended	31	December	2009,	
particularly	given	the	difficult	conditions	in	the	
UK	property	market	during	the	period.
The	first	half	of	2009	was	characterised	by	
decreasing	investment	yields,	however ,	the	
second	half	has	seen	some	stabilisation,	with	
yields	even	firming	up	slightly	towards	the	end	
of	the	year .	Commercial	property	development

Hallam	Land	had	a	quiet	year .	House	builders	
had 	 working 	 capital 	 issues 	 to 	 deal 	 with 	 and,	
until	recently ,	were	continuing	to	buy	land	only	
very 	 selectively . 	 T owards 	 the 	 end 	 of 	 the 	 year ,

their	land	banks	once	again.

notified, 	 the 	 Directors 	 felt 	 it 	 unlikely 	 that 	 the 	 recovery 	
would	be	strong	enough	in	2009	to	recommend	
a	final	dividend	in	excess	of	1.25p	(2008:	3.75p).	
As	announced,	the	Directors	decided	that	1.25p	
should	be	paid	as	a	second	interim	dividend	on	
31 	 March 	 2010 	 in 	 place 	 of 	 a 	 final 	 dividend 	 payment

This	gives	a	total	dividend	for	the	year	of	2.5p	
(2008:	5.0p).

whilst the

the property market, 
in particular, remains 
tough, I believe 
that the market is 
beginning to recover
