 Chairman's statement and review of operations
For the year ended 31 December 2009

Introductory
2009 saw Hightex Group plc successfully complete the turnaround of the membrane business. With that phase now
completed, the Directors see the chief focus for the current financial year and beyond as delivering further profitable growth of
the business as we maintain our position as a global leader in the design and installation of large area architectural tensile and
pneumatic polymer membrane structures.
Commentary on 2009 results
I am pleased to report that in the year ended 31 December 2009, Hightex increased turnover significantly to 120.0 million
(2008: 116.2 million), an increase of 23.5%. I am also delighted to report a maiden profit before tax (after non-recurring and
exceptional items, described below) of 10.8 million (2008: loss of 13.1 million), equivalent to an adjusted 2009 profit before tax
(before non-recurring and exceptional items) of 11.1 million.
Revenues were earned from several globally recognised projects also completed in 2009 including the membrane element of
the new retractable roof over the Centre Court at Wimbledon; the roof over the Dolce Vita Shopping Mall at Lisbon, Portugal;
and the inner membrane roof over the Munich Olympic Hall, a contract begun in February 2009 and largely completed before
the end of the year. Hightex also completed the Cape Town Stadium and the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg, both of which
will be seen by hundreds of millions globally this summer as South Africa hosts the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
Gross profit doubled from 12.1 million in 2008 to 14.2 million in 2009 on a comparable basis, reflecting a change in the
accounting policy on cost of sales from the  total cost method' to the  cost of sales' method. The effect of this change in
presentation, which does not impact the reported net profit nor the balance sheet, is to reclassify certain expenses from
overheads to cost of sales and to reduce the reported gross margin accordingly. The comparative figures for 2008 have been
restated accordingly. 
Aggregate operating expenses fell dramatically from 14.4 million in 2008 to 12.7 million in 2009. This reduction is explained in
part by the rigorous reduction in general overhead expenditure put into practice after April 2008, efficiency savings, the
mothballing of SolarNext and a reduction in exchange rate fluctuations.
The earnings before interest and tax rose to 11 million compared to a loss of 13.2 million in 2008. Profit before tax as adjusted
for three exceptional and non-recurring items, as detailed in the following paragraph, was 11.1 million.
Exceptional charges of 1132,000 were incurred in connection with the deconsolidation of Metal System Sp z.o.o. (in which
Hightex's interest fell from 60% to 40% in December 2009) and with the liquidation of two dormant subsidiaries, Pizaul A.G. (a
Swiss company), and Hightex Structures Pty. Ltd (a South African company). The two liquidations will be of benefit in future
years by eliminating overhead expenditure. Additionally, the 2009 charge for amortisation of intangible assets of 1162,000
includes a non-recurring accelerated charge of 1129,000 (2008: 1534,000) in relation to capitalised development expenditure
within the SolarNext business. Finally a charge was made in relation to the grant of options in September 2009 of 120,000
(2008: nil).
Hightex twice raised fresh equity capital in 2009. In June, it raised approximately  0.9 million (before expenses) in a placing
with both existing shareholders and new investors of 28,730,516 new ordinary shares at 3 pence each. In December 2009, it
raised approximately  2.7 million (before expenses) by the issue of 38,214,291 new ordinary shares at 7 pence each. The
funds provided Hightex with additional working capital and have contributed towards the planned expansion of its membrane
business. 
Shareholders' funds rose to 110.8 million (2008: 17.2 million) not only as a result of the new equity funds raised, but also
because of this year's maiden profit. Cash balances as at 31 December 2009 were 14.6 million (2008: 12.2 million).

Solar cooling business in 2009
In February 2009, as part of its re-organisation programme Hightex announced its decision to reduce its solar cooling
operations in order to conserve cash. These comprise a solar cooling and heating system in kit form able to be retro-fitted to
many kinds of structures, managed by an innovative multi-function system controller. Modest revenues of 1185,000 were
earned in 2009 from this activity; in the year, the approximate cash outflow of this division amounted to 1662,000. The
development phase of both the system and the controller has been successfully completed and the products are now ready
for larger scale commercialisation. The Board has set a priority for itself in 2010 to identify commercial partners in a number of
geographical regions in order to unlock the intrinsic value within SolarNext for the benefit of shareholders in Hightex.
Prospects 
In the second half of 2009, Hightex announced three very considerable contract wins, which collectively demonstrate that the
Company is regarded as being the partner of choice in a niche but growing sector of the construction industry using
innovative technology. These contracts have a combined value of over 145 million. The three contracts and their value to
Hightex, are: 
  the Warsaw National Stadium, Poland - fabrication and installation of main roof and fa ade steel structure, radial cable
system, and fixed & retractable membrane system - approximately 113 million.
  the Olympic Stadium in Kiev, Ukraine - fabrication and installation of the main roof radial cable system and the complete
membrane roof system - approximately 118.9 million 
  the BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada - supply of the entire retractable roof and the fixed fa ade -
approximately 113.4 million
The Warsaw and Kiev contracts relate to the upgrading of the stadia for the UEFA 2012 Euro football championships.
These three contracts are expected to have a beneficial effect on Hightex's results not only for 2010 but also for 2011. It is
likely that membrane revenues from these three contracts alone should approach 130 million in 2010 and that they will
contribute approximately 115 million to revenues in 2011. These contracts give Hightex a record trading position and
operationally strengthened recognition in the global marketplace.
Hightex continues to work on its long pipeline of potential projects within its traditional range of capability - sports stadia,
shopping malls, airports and other large area structures, all of which through regulatory, environmental, design and age
requirements are turning to membrane as the material of choice for future build and re-build. In particular, Hightex has now
identified and is working actively with its partner in Brazil, which will be the host country of the FIFA 2014 World Cup
competition and the 2016 summer Olympic Games. With the support of its partner, Hightex will be bidding on several of the
12 football stadia which are to be refurbished or newly built, and of which over half are likely to be in membrane. The
refurbishment work is likely to start as early as this year. The cyclical nature of all sports competitions ensures that the core
marketplace for Hightex has evergreen qualities. Hightex also seeks smaller contracts (typically 12 million to 15 million) which
can be completed within a relatively short time frame.
To cope with the larger prospective flow of work, Hightex has made several appointments. Mr Friedrich Naeher is joining
Hightex as Head of Technical Project Management, to be in charge of all technical aspects of projects including engineering,
fabrication and installation. He joined from Ed. Z blin AG of Stuttgart, one of the largest German contractors in the field of
building construction and civil engineering. Mr Naeher, a Master of Science and a professionally registered engineer in the
USA, has wide international experience on all aspects of projects and project management and brings extensive experience to
the Hightex management team.
In addition two new salesmen started in January and March 2010 respectively. Hightex is also planning to recruit two to three
younger engineers during 2010 in order to strengthen the engineering department for future growth.

Conclusion
In 2009, Hightex completed the turnaround of its membrane business and the Company returned a profit. I would like to pay
tribute to the considerable efforts of my colleagues on the Board as well as every member of staff for their contribution to this
improved performance. 
The near term prospects for the Group are underpinned by existing contracted revenues which should approach 130 million in
2010 and additionally deliver some 115 million to 2011. The balance sheet was significantly strengthened in 2009 through
additional high quality institutional shareholders, recognising the strength and opportunity of the Group. New membrane
contracts are being actively sought and Hightex expects to benefit from its now established reputation as an authoritative
supplier of retractable roofs for stadia and other structures.
The Directors believe that the Company is now well placed to build on its improved performance and look forward to the
future with optimism.
