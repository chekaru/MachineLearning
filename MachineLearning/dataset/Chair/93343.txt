INTRODUCTION
Holidaybreak is the UK's leading operator of
specialist holiday businesses. In the year to 
30 September 2004, we sold 2.3m holidays 
(2003: 2.0m), increased headline profits*** and
significantly reduced borrowings. 
These results are in line with market expectations
and reflect a very strong performance by both our
Hotel Breaks and Adventure divisions. The Board
will oversee the continued growth of these
businesses in a manner consistent with the Group's
core financial criteria - healthy margins, good return
on investment and the generation of cash. The
issues facing Camping are being addressed and
performance will be monitored closely. Camping is
an important part of the Holidaybreak Group,
delivering good margins and generating cash.
Once again our employees have displayed
commitment, enthusiasm and skill in all parts of the
business. I thank them all for what they have done
in 2004.
The 10% increase in the annual dividend reflects
the Board's confidence in future prospects. We are
financially strong and have a clear strategy to grow,
both organically and by bolt-on acquisition,
adapting to and exploiting the rapidly changing
market place. Management is concentrating on
maximising distribution, cost control, cash
generation and margin optimisation. The Board
remains focused on the delivery of shareholder value
in the short, medium and long term.
GROUP RESULTS
For the year to 30 September 2004, pre-tax profits
(before goodwill and exceptional items) were
 28.0m (2003:  27.9m) on turnover of  281.6m
(2003:  259.5m). Headline earnings per share***
were 44.0p (2003: 44.4p).  
As previously announced, there were exceptional
costs of  2.6m, relating to reorganisation within
Camping. 
Year-end net debt was reduced by  10.8m to
 12.5m after another year of strong cash
generation. 
DIVIDEND
The Board is recommending a final dividend of
17.6p, payable on 19 April 2005, to shareholders on
the register on 18 March 2005, making a total of
24.2 p for the year.
The Board intends to continue to pay ordinary
dividends that are appropriate in the light of the
growth prospects and the underlying performance of
the Group. 
DIVISIONAL PERFORMANCE
Hotel Breaks
Holidaybreak sold 1.7m hotel breaks in 2004
(2003: 1.45m). We are the principal provider of
domestic leisure breaks for the UK high street travel
agencies whilst growing internet sales rapidly. We
also have a growing overseas breaks programme
that represented 7% of 2004 turnover.
Our year 
Statement by 
Robert Ayling, Chairman Hotel Breaks division turnover increased by 24% to
 120.9m (2003:  97.8m). Operating profit* was up
by 32% to  14.5m (2003:  11.0m) and margins
improved to 12.0% (2003: 11.3%). The division
contributed  16.9m in net cash** (2003:  13.8m).
Hotel Breaks is the principal driver of the Group's
strong cash generation due to its very limited
capital expenditure requirements and the positive
cash flows generated by the business model.  
The Hotel Breaks division works in partnership with
140 hotel groups in the UK and many more
overseas. We bring them efficient, cost effective
distribution at attractive yields. We will reinforce
and build on these relationships whilst avoiding
fixed commitments and guarantees. 
Adventure
The Adventure division consists of two businesses,
Explore Worldwide and RegalDive. Holidaybreak
sold 41,000 adventure and diving holidays in 2004
(2003: 37,400).
The division recovered strongly after two years that
were adversely impacted by geopolitical events.
Turnover increased by 12% to  37.4 m (2003:
 33.3m). Operating profit* was up by 65% to
 3.2m (2003:  1.9m) and margins improved to
8.4% (2003: 5.7%). The division contributed  2.8m
in net cash** (2003:  2.2m). 
Explore is the UK market leader in the  soft'
adventure sector. It now offers a range of cycling,
walking and trekking, adventure short breaks and
family adventures in addition to the core worldwide
tours programme. These new products will allow it
to exploit a growing demand for this type of holiday. 
RegalDive is the UK's leading dive tour operator. It
is an important component of our consumer offer in
this division and enjoyed a strong performance in
2004. It contributed 15% of divisional sales and
11% of operating profit.
Camping
Holidaybreak sold 570,000 European camping and
mobile-home holidays in 2004 (2003: 580,000).
Our main brands, Eurocamp and Keycamp, are
market leaders.  
Turnover in Camping was  123.2 m (2003:
 128.4m). Operating profit* was  13.7m (2003:
 18.9m). Margins were 11.1% (2003: 14.7%). The
division contributed  8.9m in net cash** (2003:
 9.8m).  An impairment review of the Eurosites
acquisition has been carried out.  This has resulted
in a goodwill impairment charge of  5.3m.
In April, we highlighted the problem of weak sales
in Camping.   As well as lower volumes, profitability
was adversely affected by a mismatch between
customer demand levels and capacity, exacerbated
by a major shift in regional demand patterns. For
2005 the division has been reorganised, cost
savings effected and campsite capacity reduced.
Capital expenditure for the division will be lower at
 5.6m (2004:  12.8m), net of mobile-home disposal
proceeds. 
This month, we will be launching a new internet
site, ugogo.com, aimed at driving low season sales.
This will be a  no frills' product, targeting the off-
peak market. It represents part of our push to
improve occupancy rates whilst protecting our
premium brands and high season prices. 
Camping remains profitable and cash generative
with healthy, double-digit margins. It will continue
to be managed carefully, with a strong focus on
capacity utilisation and margins. 
BOARD AND MANAGEMENT
Matthew Cheetham succeeded Jim Crew as
Managing Director of Camping whose retirement
was announced in November 2003. Matthew, who
joined Holidaybreak from MyTravel Group plc on 
26 January 2004, was appointed to the Board on
10 February 2004. Jim Crew stepped down from the
Board on that date. We thank Jim for his
contribution to the Company since he joined in
1989 and wish him well in the future.

In September, we announced the senior Camping
division appointments of Deborah Beckett and
Robin Parry, who are responsible for pan-European
marketing and sales for the Eurocamp and Keycamp
brands respectively. All members of the top team are
now based in the divisional head office in
Northwich, Cheshire, following the decision, also
announced in September, to close Keycamp's sales
and marketing office in Sutton, Surrey.  This has now
been successfully implemented.
Sally Martin joined the Board as a non-executive
director on 16 July 2004.  Sally was a Director of
Qantas Holidays plc from 1999 to 2004.  We
anticipate making a further non-executive
appointment in the near future, to replace Clive
Mclintock, who has served Holidaybreak in this
capacity since August 1999 and will retire from the
Board at the end of the year.  We thank him for his
valuable service both as non-executive director and
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.  Sally
Martin will succeed Clive as Chair of the
Remuneration Committee.
OUTLOOK
We are at a fairly early stage in the season and
initial trading indicators should be seen in that
context. To date, trading for 2005 has been in line
with management expectations.  Overall sales for
the Group are 8% higher than at the same point in
2004. Sales for Hotel Breaks are 10% up whilst
Adventure has started very strongly and is 34%
ahead. These figures reflect continuing consumer
trends towards short-break and specialist holidays.
In the current year, Camping will continue to
generate cash and profits at good margins. Sales to
date are 5% lower than last year's equivalent but
this should be seen in the context of an 11%
reduction in capacity, as the management focuses
on building occupancy rates and meeting their
financial targets. 
The Board remains committed to growing
shareholder value. It believes this can currently best
be achieved by actively growing the business, both
organically and by acquisition.  
Holidaybreak is the UK's leading operator of
specialist holidays and a market leader in the
sectors in which it operates.  Trading for 2005 has
started broadly in line with management
expectations.  We aim to achieve attractive margin
performance, a good trading result and further cash
generation.
