 hot group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003
Chairman's Statement
3
During the year we raised  10.2m
to fund our acquisition programme
and attracted a number of new
institutional shareholders. We are
excited about the future prospects
for the business and remain alert
to opportunities for significant
further growth, both organic and
through acquisition.
Financial Results
The group operates in the Human
Capital Service sector, where the
underlying value of businesses is
based on customer service and
retention, employee experience
and ownership of enabling
technologies. As part of our
strategy to develop the group
through acquisition, it follows
therefore that the major asset 
of acquired businesses is
purchased goodwill.
The Board believes that in the
light of this reality the most
meaningful measure of
performance for hot group is
operating profit/loss on ordinary
activities before any charges for
goodwill amortisation, interest,
exceptional items and taxation.
This measure of performance
provides a good indication of the
cash generative performance of
the group, both in absolute
terms, and also in relative terms
when viewed from an adjusted
EPS perspective. 
Consequently, results for the year
ended 31 August 2003 show
operating losses before goodwill
amortisation of  0.438m
compared with losses of  2.225m
for the previous 16 month
reporting period. The group's
financial performance shows
continuous quarter on quarter
improvements, with the first
recorded profit delivered in the
fourth quarter. Sales from
continuing operations grew 141%
to  2.626m. 
Administrative expenses have
fallen significantly from  4.357m
to  2.869m, primarily due to a
combination of reduced costs in
2003 and one time charges taken
in the 16 months to 2002.
The loss on ordinary activities
after taxation reported by the
group shows  4.762m, compared
with the loss in the 16 month
period to August 2002 of  4.710m.
This loss is stated after a goodwill
amortisation charge of  5.410m,
which reflects the decision of 
the Board to accelerate the 
write off of goodwill over 3 years
instead of the previous write 
off period of 20 years. The 
Board believes that goodwill
should be written off on
acquisition, but will continue 
to observe current accounting
guidelines.
I would also draw your attention
to the deferred tax credit of
 1.296m, which has been
reflected in our results. This asset
has been recognised as a result of
the Board's confidence in utilising
the accumulated tax losses in
hotonline now that the online
division has started to generate
operating profits.
Earnings per share for the period
to 31st August 2003 before
amortisation of goodwill of 
1.63p have improved substantially
from the loss per share before
amortisation for the 16 month
period to August 2002 of 29.35p.
Consistent with management's
preferred peformance measure
for the business, the loss per
share before interest, exceptional
items, amortisation of goodwill
and taxation was 1.00p, compared
with 12.92p in the sixteen months
ended 31 August 2002.
Following our successful fund
raising in August, the group has a
strong cash position, with
 4.970m as at 31st August 2003.
Operations   Online Division
We have successfully consolidated
our online services and now offer
two distinct products, one to
agencies and one directly to
employers. We are currently
looking to expand the  hotonline'
network through the acquisition
of sites that complement our
current offering, thus
strengthening existing products,
and niche sites that penetrate
sectors new to the business. This
approach will ensure an increase
in monthly traffic, enhanced
response rates for customers and
a widening of our market
opportunity. Furthermore, it will
increase our market share and
secure our position as one of the
largest suppliers of online
recruitment in the UK.
Operations   Traditional Division
Our traditional division has
developed significantly over the
last year. Following three
I am pleased to report a year of great change and
development in the group. We have successfully
implemented the second phase of our strategy
and have built two profitable stand-alone
businesses, in online and traditional recruitment,
involving a series of strategic acquisitions. 
We acquired two businesses during the financial
year , with two further acquisitions completed
since the year-end, including today's acquisition,
which takes us into one of the fastest-growing
markets, educational recruitment. Chairman's Statement

acquisitions, including today's, we
now specialise in placing
temporary and permanent staff in
the education, financial, retail,
leisure, secretarial and corporate
sales sectors, and provide a fast,
high quality service for both
clients and candidates. We see
exceptional expansion
opportunities through the
acquisition of businesses in niche
sectors, especially those that
present synergies with our online
product offerings. In this way,
both divisions are able to support
and enhance the services offered
by the other.
Acquisitions
During the year we strengthened
our online division with the  3m
acquisition of PlanetRecruit
Limited, a leading supplier of
online services for recruitment
firms and jobseekers.  
We also launched our traditional
recruitment division with the
acquisition of Parkside
Recruitment Limited ( Parkside')
for  5.5m. Established in 1989,
Parkside has annual turnover 
of  9.5m and specialises in the
provision of temporary and
permanent finance and office
staff, mainly in the Greater
London and Thames Valley
region. Customers include blue
chip companies such as
GlaxoSmithKline, Amazon, Honda,
Waitrose, Air Products & ICI Paints.
Since the year end we have
acquired Buzz Recruitment
Consultancy Limited, specialising
in permanent recruitment in the
leisure, retail and corporate sales
markets, and Buzztempz Limited,
which supplies temporary staff.
These two deals cost a total of
 0.38m (with additional deferred
consideration of up to  100,000,
contingent upon the achievement
of certain working capital targets)
and significantly strengthen our
traditional recruitment business.
In addition, today we announced
the acquisition of International
Teachers Network Ltd (ITN) for
 5.6m in a cash and shares deal,
linked to an earn-out based on
the results for the year to 
31 December 2004. ITN supplies
temporary teachers to schools
and local education authorities in
London and the South East. From
its launch in January 2001, ITN
has experienced immense growth
and, in the 12 months to
December 2002, generated
revenues of  6.484m and profits
of  0.645m. The education sector
is a major growth area, which
offers exciting opportunities for
the group; we believe there is
considerable potential, through
synergies with the online division,
to increase cost-effective
candidate flow and speed-up
response rates to customers.
Funding
In order to fund the next phase
of development, we recently
raised  10.2m through a Placing
and Open Offer. Underwritten 
by our brokers, Numis, the
fundraising generated
substantial interest from a
number of significant
institutional investors who have
all recognised the potential of
the group. 
The Board
We have strengthened our Board
with the appointment of two new
directors. John Sanderson joined
as a Non-Executive Director in
May. John is a well known figure
in the business advisory industry
with a focus on media and
technology. He also has
considerable experience in the
City. I am also very pleased that
Doug Woodward became
Managing Director of the
traditional recruitment division in
September. I previously worked
with Doug at Delphi Group, where
he played a key role in the
development of a leading
European recruitment operation.
The Future
Our vision is to change the face
of recruitment: to challenge
outdated resourcing processes by
combining online and traditional
recruitment through a blend of
technology, creative thinking and
effective management. Over the
long term we foresee considerable
scope for developing a business
model that combines the speed
and cost-efficiency of online
recruitment services, as well as
our bespoke candidate
management software, with the
personal touch provided by
traditional recruitment
operations. Our aim is to provide
clients with a higher calibre
short-list of candidates quickly
and more efficiently. We recently
carried out a pilot scheme to
explore how to operate this
hybrid service most effectively,
working closely with a client who
required a fresh and creative
approach to their recruitment
strategy. In the medium term we
aim to enhance our organic
growth by exploring potential
acquisitions to expand both the
online and traditional
recruitment divisions.
I would like to take this
opportunity to thank all those
involved in the group for their
hard work and enthusiasm over
the last year. The first half of the
new financial year is already
showing healthy business
volumes, and we look forward to
the future with confidence.
