 CV90 FAMILY
Results
In the year ended 31 December 2003 Group
sales were  348.8m (2002:  225.7m), profit
before tax, goodwill and exceptional items was
 19.8m (2002:  16.5m) and profit before tax was
 20.3m (2002:  14.5m). Group profit after tax was
 20.4m (2002:  10.0m) and earnings per ordinary
share were 18.6p before goodwill and
exceptional items (2002: 10.4p) and 19.3p after
goodwill and exceptional items (2002: 9.1p).
Notable changes to the composition of the 2003
profit before tax, exceptionals and goodwill as
compared with 2002 were:
  an increase in trading profit at Alvis
H gglunds from  12.4m in 2002 to  19.6m
in 2003,
  a reduction in trading profit in the UK from
 4.9m in 2002 to  2.8m in 2003,
  a trading profit at Alvis South Africa of
 0.8m (2002:  0.1m),
  an increase in the trading loss at Alvis
Moelv from  1.2m in 2002 to  2.3m in 2003.
The improved trading profit at Alvis H gglunds
arose from a substantial increase in sales from
 104.1m in 2002 to  175.7m in 2003. The biggest
factor in the sales increase was the ramp up of
serial deliveries of CV90 to Switzerland. Serial
deliveries of CV90 to Finland also commenced in
the year.
In the UK sales increased from  107.4m in 2002
to  133.9m in 2003 as a result of the
incorporation for a full year of the former
Vickers Defence businesses. However, on a pro
forma basis sales were lower in 2003 than those
posted by the companies as separate entities in
2002, and the cost base of the combined
business in relation to revenue available in 2003
caused a reduction in trading profit.
The Group's net funds position at 31 December
2003 was  80.0m (2002:  65.3m). The increase
reflected a good performance on milestone
payments on major projects and the receipt of
 15.7m as a working capital related price
adjustment, net of further costs on the
acquisition of Vickers Defence.
Operations
Alvis H gglunds faced the task of building up
production on three major new programmes
simultaneously in 2003, being ATV(P) for UK,
CV90 for Switzerland, and CV90 for Finland.
ATV(P) is a completely new product, the CV90
specification for Switzerland is a substantial
advance on previous build standards, and the
Finnish specification is different again.
The challenges in engineering, manufacturing
and supplier management have been largely
surmounted, and Alvis H gglunds performed
well in boosting their sales by over 65%
in a year.
Alvis Vickers had to manage a major
reorganisation and a demand from the UK MoD
for exceptional support for Operation Telic in
Iraq, whilst at the same time maintaining focus
and programme performance on major projects,
including MRAV and the new Titan/Trojan
Engineer Tanks. These goals were largely
accomplished. The company performed
exceptionally well in meeting the demands of
Operation Telic, which included the deployment
of over 50 staff to Kuwait to fit urgently required
upgrade kits to Challenger 2 tanks. The whole
episode showed the importance of the UK
industrial base to the fighting ability of the
Armed Forces, and the company was publicly
thanked by the MoD for its contribution.
Alvis Bridging made a small profit in the year.
Effort was mainly concentrated on engineering
and manufacturing work for a new bridging
system for Malaysia which is due for delivery
in 2004.
In South Africa, Alvis OMC made a small
operating profit, being limited by slow order
intake in the export market, whilst Alvis Gear
Ratio performed well.
Chairman s Statement
6 Alvis Vickers Reorganisation
As reported at the half-year, the integration of
the Vickers Defence businesses into the Alvis
Group has gone well. The new Alvis Vickers
management team under the leadership of
Trevor Harrison has come together effectively.
The main changes in 2003 were: a reduction in
administrative staff to eliminate duplicated
functions; the creation of a business
headquarters at Newcastle with associated
moves of staff from Telford; the move of Leeds-
based staff to a new facility forming the
company's centre of excellence for systems
engineering and electronics; and the
concentration of Telford staff onto the main
production site, allowing the leased office block
to be vacated.
An exceptional charge of  2.0m was made at
Alvis Vickers in 2003, which, together with the
charge of  2.0m taken in 2002, covered the cost
of these restructuring moves.
In January 2004 a further phase of
reorganisation was announced, involving a
major reduction of manufacturing activities on
the Telford site. A charge of  3.5m will be taken
for this in 2004. Overall we do not expect the
cash cost of the reorganisation consequent on
the acquisition of Vickers Defence and the
creation of Alvis Vickers Limited to exceed the
 7.5m announced at the time of the acquisition.
A further charge of  1.5m will be taken in 2004
to cover the cost of a reduction in engineering
manpower to match resources to the workload
now forseen.
Completion of these elements of reorganisation
will result in an overall reduction in annual
costs of some  9.0m. Moreover, the acquisition
of Vickers Defence has significantly enhanced
the market position of Alvis, particularly in the
UK, and we are confident that it will bring
considerable benefits in the future.
Alvis Moelv
Alvis Moelv had made a loss in recent years
due to a very narrow market position,
programme cancellations and postponements,
and a difficult, high cost operating environment.
In January 2004 it was announced that Alvis
Moelv would close later this year. A charge of
 3.5m will be taken in 2004 to cover the cost of
closure, the majority of which relates to future
rental costs of the facility.
Chairman s Statement
7 People and Organisation
There were no changes in the composition of
the Alvis Board in 2003. Following the departure
of GKN from the share register, David Wright,
formerly the GKN nominee, has remained on the
Board as an independent Non-executive
Director. The Board values his experience and
input. David has succeeded Trevor Beyer as
Chairman of the Audit Committee. Trevor Beyer
is chairman of the Remuneration and
Nomination Committees. The Board has
examined its own composition and procedures
carefully in the light of the requirements of the
business and prevailing corporate governance
guidelines, and believes they are appropriate.
We will keep them under review as the
business develops.
Orders
The Group's order intake in the year was
 420.6m (2002:  149.7m). The order book at 31
December 2003 stood at  892.6m (2002:
 781.1m). Of this  404m was at Alvis Vickers,
 438m at Alvis H gglunds, with the balance at
Alvis Bridging and Alvis South Africa.
Major orders received in the year included the
FCLV programme for the UK at Alvis Vickers
( 142m), and Bv206S for Italy and AMOS
development for Finland at Alvis H gglunds
( 57m and  31m respectively). Spares and
maintenance orders across the Group
exceeded  85m, whilst upgrade orders
exceeded  50m. This shows the strength of
recurring business arising out of the Group's
large installed vehicle base.
Prospects
Based on deliverable orders on hand for 2004
and a normal anticipated level of recurring
business, we expect the Group to make some
further progress in 2004. The outlook for 2005 is
better, with growth in sales anticipated at Alvis
Vickers as the Titan/Trojan programme moves
into series deliveries. Progress would be further
enhanced by additional export orders at Alvis
Vickers. We continue to pursue some major
export campaigns, primarily in the Middle East.
We remain optimistic about a positive outcome
to these efforts, but timing remains, as ever,
difficult to judge. At Alvis H gglunds we are
pursuing good prospects for major additional
CV90 and all-terrain vehicle orders, mainly
in Europe.

MLV The future of the UK market is very important for
Alvis in the medium and long term. Whilst we
were disappointed at the UK's withdrawal from
MRAV, the prospect of business growth from
the UK market remains, particularly in the
Future Rapid Effect System (FRES) programme.
FRES, which has superseded elements of
MRAV, is a programme for a range of new
armoured platforms which will be at the heart of
the British Army's future rapid reaction
capability for worldwide operations and of the
UK MoD's drive to establish Network Enabled
Capability.
FRES is expected to start with an assessment
phase in 2004, and the Alvis Group is well
placed to contribute to this and the subsequent
demonstration and manufacturing phases. The
acquisition of Vickers Defence has brought
additional skills in systems engineering,
software and electronics, which are vital to
programmes such as FRES.
In Sweden there is interest in developing a new
light armoured vehicle (SEP programme).
Alvis H gglunds has already completed 
extensive study and technology demonstration
work for SEP . There are potential overlaps
between SEP and FRES, and Alvis Vickers and
Alvis H gglunds are working closely together
to maximise their contribution to both
programmes and the potential benefits of
linkage between them.
Recommended Offer
As separately announced, the Board is
recommending  a cash offer for the Company of
280p per share from General Dynamics for the
reasons stated in the offer announcement.
Dividend
In view of the offer, the Board is not
recommending a final dividend for 2003. Should
the offer be unsuccessful and Alvis remain an
independent company, the Board intends to
declare an interim dividend of 4.0p per share in
lieu of the 2003 final dividend.
