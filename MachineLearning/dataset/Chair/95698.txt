Thomas
Results
I am very pleased to report another
excellent year with results well ahead
of last year and ahead of market
expectations.
Revenues grew by 19% to  203.1m
(2006:  171.3m), with net revenue,
after deduction of direct project costs,
increasing by 20% to  167.4m (2006:
 139.2m).  Operating profit increased
by 47% to  14.3m (2006:  9.8m).
Profit before tax was  13.3m (2006:
 8.3m) an increase of 60%. Earnings
after tax were  11.3m (2006:  7.1m).
Included in these figures was a gain of
 5.1m following a pensionable salary
freeze and the transfer of members
out of the Acer Group Pension
Scheme (AGPS), partially offset by
provisions of  0.8m against properties
and restructuring costs.  As a
consequence, adjusted operating profit
was  11.4m (2006:  8.4m), an
increase of 36%.  The tax charge
includes an amount of  1.1m in
respect of adjusted items and adjusted
EPS was up 41% from 19.28p to
27.21p.
The Directors propose a final dividend
of 1.40p per share (2006: 0.90p)
making a full year dividend of 2p per
share (2006: 1.25p), an increase of
60%.
Acquisitions
In October we raised  7.6m, net of
fees, through a placing which has
enabled us to sustain our acquisition
programme.  During the year we made
three acquisitions with a maximum
potential consideration, including earn-
outs, amounting to  9.1m.  These
were: in April, environmental
consultants Cresswell Associates in
the UK; in June, civil engineers
Munnich Projekt in Germany; and in
July, landscape architects ACLA in
Hong Kong and China. All have been
integrated into the Group and are
performing well, contributing  1.1m to
adjusted operating profit.  In April 2007
we completed the acquisition of cost
consultancy RPA Quantity Surveyors
Limited (RPA) in the UK for a
maximum potential consideration of
 3.3m.  We are pursuing further infill
acquisitions in our existing territories
and market sectors, and have a
pipeline of deals under review and
negotiation.
International S Spread
Our long established local presence in
international markets is a key
differentiator from our competitors.  As
a Group we are celebrating our 150
th
anniversary in 2007 but the year also
marks 40 years in the Middle East and
Hong Kong, and 15 years in Germany.
In Australia we have just celebrated
the 75
th
anniversary of the opening of
the Sydney Harbour Bridge.  Our
commitment to these markets and our
long term presence there has earned
us an excellent reputation and
equipped us with invaluable local
knowledge.
We were very glad to be named
'International Firm of the Year' in the
Consultants of the Year 2007 Awards
organised by the Association for
Consultancy and Engineering and
New Civil Engineer magazine.  This
award is testimony to the scale and
quality of our international operations,
which we believe mitigates regional
economic risks and enhances the
quality of earnings. 
Strategy
A central element of the Group's
strategy is to improve operating
margins by concentrating on four key
areas; continuously improving the
quality of service to key clients;
effective staff recruitment,
development and retention; increasing
the proportion of higher value advisory
work; and through carefully selected
infill acquisitions.
Adjusted operating margins increased
from 4.9% in 2006 to 5.6% in 2007.
After accounting for direct project
costs, adjusted operating margins 3
based on net revenue increased from
6.0% in 2006 to 6.8% in 2007,
showing further tangible progress
towards our goal of 10%.
Business R Review H Highlights
Our results in the UK continue to
improve with a good mix of public and
private sector clients.  In the
transportation sector we are working
on significant contracts for the
Highways Agency and TfL, as well as
for the London Underground.  Work on
AMP4 frameworks continues for
Thames Water, Welsh Water and
South West Water, and we are well
positioned to win further work for the
Olympics in 2012.  Our environmental
business has grown strongly, and
there was a significant contribution
from new acquisition, Cresswell
Associates.
The acquisition of Munnich Projekt is a
first step in our plan to boost the scale
and coverage of our business in
Germany and will give us access to
the important highways sector there.
Our business in the Middle East has
grown significantly over recent years
and we now have almost 1,200 staff
permanently based there.  The
markets in which we operate, notably
the United Arab Emirates, Qatar,
Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, all
remain buoyant although we are
conscious of the possibilities of
overheating in some areas and are
planning accordingly.  Our work is
primarily in the property sector and is
on a wide range of important and
prestigious projects including the
tallest building in the world, Burj
Dubai, and the tallest buildings in both
Abu Dhabi and Qatar.
The market in Australia remains
strong, particularly for roads and
bridges.  The contracts for this type of
work have recently changed, such that
projects are now being awarded
through formal Alliance mechanisms
between contractors, consultants, and
clients. These contracts aim to
accelerate project execution and
reduce project risks through improved
cooperation between the parties.
Though the overall level of fees for
consultants is expected to reduce,
margins should improve.  After a slow
start, which affected the second half,
we recently secured our first such
contracts, the West Gate Freeway
Alliance in Melbourne and the Hale
Street Link Alliance in Queensland,
which will provide a useful flow of work
during the coming year. 
In Hong Kong the acquisition of ACLA
has performed well and has enhanced
our offering in China.  It has been an
important step in attaining critical
mass in the region and has increased
the proportion of advisory work there.
People
Despite the fierce competition for
qualified consultants our staff numbers
are growing and we currently employ
around 4,000 people. We need to
recruit, develop and retain talented
people to sustain this growth and are
investing heavily in human resources
programmes, notably staff
development and succession planning
for each key position. Misti Melville
has recently been appointed to the
Executive Board as Human Resources
and Communications Director to lead
this important effort.  
Board o of D Directors
Paul Withers joined us as a Non-
Executive Director in September 2006,
following which Peter Higgins retired
as he had indicated last year. I would
again like to express our warm
appreciation for Peter's contribution.
In May 2007, Jeffrey Hume also joined
the Board as a Non-Executive
Director. Both Paul and Jeffrey have
considerable experience as directors
of substantial LSE listed companies
and we are delighted to welcome them
both to the Company.
1894 - T Tower B Bridge
London, UK
John Wolfe Barry, in partnership with Henry
Brunel (son of Isambard Kingdom Brunel) was
appointed to work on Tower Bridge in 1884.
They were influential in the choice of the bridge's
famous rising deck which gave a 200 feet
clearway to enable traffic on the River Thames
to pass through. The bridge was heralded for its
advance of design in steel, increasingly the
material of choice at the time. It was opened by
the Prince and Princess of Wales in 1894.
Our
environmental
business has
continued to
grow strongly. Outlook
Our order book remains strong at
 244m (2006:  240m) and all our
markets are buoyant. We have already
secured nearly 60% of our target 2007
/ 08 revenue giving us an excellent
foundation for the year ahead.
We will continue to pursue our
programme of selective infill
acquisitions at realistic multiples which
will be earnings enhancing.  As the
scale of our business increases we
may consider larger acquisitions but
only if they meet our exacting criteria.
In summary, we are very pleased with
the progress made during the year; we
grew strongly; the operating margin
improved; and our acquisitions were
successfully integrated.  We are
confident of another successful year
ahead.
Finally, I would like to thank our clients
for their confidence in Hyder
Consulting and to all members of our
staff for their contribution to these
results.

1932 - S Sydney H Harbour B Bridge
Australia
The Harbour Bridge remains the main link
between the north and south of Sydney, despite
the addition of the Harbour Tunnel in the 1980's
to relieve congestion on the bridge. The bridge
has spawned its own tourism industry with the
nerve tingling 'Bridge Climb' (another Hyder
project). The design itself was intended to reflect
the end of the industrial era. When it was
opened, it was the longest single span steel arch
bridge in the world. The main span is 503 meters
(1,650 feet) across and required more than
52,800 tonnes of silicon based steel trusses.
