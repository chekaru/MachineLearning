 Introduction
i-design made good progress
over the year, adding two 
major new ATM operators 
as customers and agreeing
additional software licence sales
with existing customers. As a
result, i-design delivered its best
ever year for software licence
sales. The sales build on the
launch last year of our next
generation software solution,
joono, and serve to confirm the
strength of our offering to ATM
owners. The total number of
major banking networks which
have licensed software from us
now stands at ten and includes
both domestic and overseas
banking networks. 
Software licence sales also represent 
our most profitable revenue stream and
this year's record software licence sales
helped profit before tax to more than
double to  217,000 (2011:  105,000) 
on revenues of  3.28m (2011:  3.52m).
Reflecting the economic backdrop, 
sales from third party advertising were
softer year on year. However, despite
continued tough trading conditions, 
the second half showed a marked
improvement on the first half, with 
a double digit increase in media 
sales revenues. 
The extension of our ATM customer
base in both the UK and North America
with the addition of FDR Limited (part
of First Data Corporation, the global
leader in electronic commerce and
payment processing) and a leading
Canadian bank, together with
substantial new licence sales from
Barclays and Cardtronics, underline 
our dominance within the UK ATM
market, and the increasing interest we
are seeing for our solution overseas,
especially North America. This is
encouraging and we continue to view
our longer term expansion prospects
positively. 
Results 
Total revenue for the year ended 30
September 2012 was  3.28 million,
representing a 7% decrease from  3.52
million in 2011, caused mainly by lower
advertising revenues. However, the lower
advertising revenues were compensated
for by higher software revenues and 
this together with a capitalisation of
research and developments costs 
meant that gross profit was  79,000
higher than 2011 at  1,456,000 (2011:
 1,377,000).
Administrative costs were  13,000
higher than last year at  1,313,000 
(2011:  1,300,000) mainly as a result of
increased travel costs. Other income of
 72,000 (2011:  24,000, including grants
of  5,000) represents grants received in
support of the Company continuing to
develop. The Group generated an
operating profit of  215,000 (2011:
 101,000) and a profit before tax 
of  217,000 (2011:  105,000). 
These numbers are presented after
capitalisation of research and
development costs in the year of
 132,000 (2011:  74,000) and a charge
for amortising capitalised research and
development costs of  68,000 (2011:
 nil). Further information on this is
provided in note 8. After R&D tax 
credits of  41,000 (2011:  46,000), 
the profit after tax was  258,000 
(2011:  151,000). The basic profit per
share was 1.8p (2011: 1.1p). 
The net cash outflow from operating
activities was  42,000 (2011: inflow
 247,000), with other investing and
financing outflows of  142,000 (2011:
outflow  52,000) resulting in a cash
outflow of  184,000 in the year (2011:
inflow  195,000). The operating cash
outflow was mainly as a result of a
reduction in the number of days taken
to pay creditors. This reduction was
caused by the timing of revenue share
payments to network owners. 
Outstanding borrowings of  8,000 
at 30 September 2012 (2011:  13,000)
represent finance leases on the purchase
of computer equipment. The Group's 
net cash and cash equivalents position
at the year-end stood at  757,000, a
decrease of 20% against the same 
point last year (2011:  941,000). 
Dividend
As previously indicated, the Directors
intend to devote the Company's cash
resources to growing its operations.
However, we will reconsider the
Company's dividend policy as and 
when the Company is in a position 
to pay a dividend.
Chairman's statement 02
i-design group plc
growing our target market contract marked the third major sale of
our marketing solution, joono, since its
launch. Also in the year, Barclays and
Cardtronics, both existing customers,
each acquired additional software
licences, between them significantly
increasing the number of ATMs licensed
to run our software in the UK, USA 
and Canada. 
In the second half of the financial year, in
late September, following a competitive
tender process, we secured an exclusive
multi-year agreement with ASDA Money.
The contract gives i-design exclusive
rights to sell advertising space across
ASDA's entire network of ATMs, totalling
approximately 1,000 high transaction
volume machines. Located in ASDA
stores across the UK, we believe that
this offers a compelling proposition 
for advertisers. The contract helps 
to consolidate our third party ATM
advertising estate, which already offers
advertisers access to ATMs at Tesco
stores and other high footfall high street
locations as well as numerous other
locations throughout the UK. 
Revenues from third party advertising
typically reflect the wider economy,
which remained tough and revenues for
the 12 months under review were softer
than the prior year although the second
half showed a material improvement on
the first half and we continued to retain
repeat business with existing advertising
clients such as Pizza Hut, Vodafone 
and Camelot. New high profile ATM
advertising campaigns that we 
secured this year include Arla, Danone,
Batchelors, Argos and Budweiser and
we continue to extend our relationships
with advertising agencies and
advertisers. 
After the year end, in November, 
we launched an add-on component,
Favourite Transaction , to our joono
software solution. This new functionality
represents an industry first and
Nationwide Building Society has rolled
out the new feature across its entire self-
service estate. Favourite Transaction 
offers cardholders their most used
transactions automatically at the ATM,
with no manual setup required and also
adapts to a customer's changing
transactional habits. 
With ten banking networks now having
adopted our marketing software, our
total licensed ATM estate currently
stands at approximately 30,000 (40%
higher than 2011), of which 9,500 of
these are available for advertising, 
up by 1,000 on 2011. 
Team Effort 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to
thank all of our staff for their hard work
and commitment during the year. We
are also grateful for the continued
support of our customers and
shareholders.
Prospects
i-design's services remain market
leading, with our third party advertising
offering opening up new revenue
streams to network owners and banks.
The signing of two major new ATM
operators as customers this year, along
with additional licence purchases from
existing clients, and an exclusive
advertising agreement with a major
supermarket retailer, continues to
demonstrate the appeal and revenue
generating advantages our solution
offers to both ATM owners and
advertisers. The advertising market will
remain very challenging in the short
term but we believe our longer term
growth potential remains encouraging,
with scope to continue building our ATM
customer base as well as third party
advertising revenues. We believe that
the business is well placed and the
Board remains positive about the
Group's longer term growth prospects.
James Faulds
Chairman
Business Progress
We have made very good headway over
the course of the year in developing our
business and our sales pipeline remains
encouraging. Our next generation
customer engagement software, 
joono, which we launched in mid 2011,
continues to open up new opportunities
for us. Crucially, joono enables banks to
deliver highly sophisticated customer
interaction at the ATM and its
architecture has been developed to
support the addition of further digital
channels including mobile phones and
plasma screens, in addition to ATMs and
self-service devices. The software also
remains platform independent, capable
of installation across any type of 
self-service/ATM device and, more
importantly, any Windows based ATM
software application environment. At 
the same time as facilitating banks' own
one-to-one marketing communications
with customers, we continue to provide
banks and ATM operators with the
option of using our exclusive services 
to generate third party advertising
revenues from their ATM estates. This 
is an unrivalled combination in our
industry and we continue to invest 
in our product offering to ensure that
we retain our market-leading position. 
As well as winning two major contracts
with ATM operators, we added an
exclusive multi-year advertising
agreement for ATMs located at the
stores of ASDA, the UK's second 
largest supermarket. 
The November 2011 signing of a major
Canadian bank was, as we have
previously reported, our first licence
agreement in Canada and our first with
channel partner, IBM Canada Limited.
Covering the bank's entire ATM estate 
in Canada, comprising over 4,000 ATMs,
the deal established us with a presence
in this important territory. In June 2012,
we secured an exclusive multi-year
contract win with FDR Limited, a
subsidiary of global electronic
commerce and payment processing
company First Data Corporation. The
i-design group plc
growing our target market 03  2012 saw i-design secure an
exclusive contract with ASDA
Money, the personal finance
subsidiary of supermarket chain
ASDA for the provision of atmAd.
The agreement sees the number of
ASDA based ATMs available for third
party advertising grow to over 1,000.
