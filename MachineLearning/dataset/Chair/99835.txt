Chairman' s statement 
Inchcape has once more produced a very strong set of results. 
The benefits of our international spread, across six core markets,
are clearly demonstrated by a 20.1% growth in operating profit
before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items (see note 1b).
This performance is the result of outstanding profit growth in
Singapore, solid performances in Greece, Belgium and Australia,
and an improved performance from our UK business. Hong Kong
suffered a decline in profits as a result of exceptionally difficult
conditions, which significantly affected the new car market. 
Headline profit before tax, goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items was up 21 .1% with Headline earnings per share
of 132.4p rising 26.7% (see note 10). Operating cash flow in the
year was  150.8m, representing some 1 16.0% of subsidiaries
operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
This excellent financial result is especially pleasing as it is
accompanied by an impressive operational performance in our 
core markets. We remain market leader and increased market
share for T oyota in Hong Kong, Singapore and Greece. For the
eighth consecutive year, Subaru in Australia recorded year on 
year growth in sales. 
In the UK the new Block Exemption legislation is now in 
force. There are already signs that this has resulted in large UK
dealer groups having much more control over the size, shape 
and security of their dealership networks.
Acquisitions and disposals
Our primary focus during 2003 was the restructuring of our 
UK Retail network in the run up to the new Block Exemption
legislation, which came into effect on 1 October 2003. The most
significant transactions related to the BMW franchise, where we
purchased six dealerships, building the largest contiguous territory
in the country stretching from T unbridge Wells in the east through
to Thames Ditton in the west. As part of this restructuring we
disposed of four BMW outlets.
In addition we acquired, or opened, seven dealerships in 
the year with other manufacturer partners. UK Retail now has a
strong base from which it will continue the development of scale
relationships with selected manufacturers, as part of our strategy
to build large contiguous territories.
Total spend on acquisitions in the period was  22.1m, of which
 21 .0m related to UK Retail. Cash inflow from disposals totalled
 21 .6m, of which  15.7m related to UK Retail.
Financial performance
T urnover of  3.9bn was up by 9.6% over 2002. Operating profit 
in the year was  150.6m. This includes a VAT refund of  15.3m,
which was treated as an exceptional item. Excluding this and the
goodwill amortisation charge of  5.5m, underlying operating profit
rose by 20.1% to  140.8m.
Headline profit before tax was up 21 .1% on last year at
 135.8m. Headline earnings per share rose by 26.7% to 132.4p
although this benefited from a one off tax credit, which positively
impacted Headline earnings per share by 5.2p.
The VAT refund also included  22.2m of interest income and
this is shown in the interest line. Profit before tax, including  37 .5m
in relation to the VAT refund, was  168.3m.
Net cash inflow in the year was  62.5m. As a result the year
end net cash position improved to  79.1m.
Balance sheet strength
The ability of our businesses to generate high levels of free cash
flow has provided the Group with a very strong platform for the
future. This, coupled with disposal proceeds, has enabled us to
return c.  130.0m to shareholders since mid 1999 through
dividends and a share buy back programme. This is after significant
investment on acquisitions, and organic growth in areas such as
Subaru Retail in Melbourne, T oyota Retail in Greece, and the Balkans.
Our strategic development plans remain on track and
encompass further expansion of our Retail activities in Greece 
and Australia. We continue to examine the Chinese market, where
the retailing sector will undergo significant change as the market
expands. Our initial entry requirement for this market is to secure
the right partnership with a local company.
In the UK the new Block Exemption legislation is encouraging
consolidation and we intend to expand our Retail dealership
network by enhancing, or establishing, contiguous territories 
with selected manufacturers. There are many opportunities
available to us and we will pursue those, which we believe will 
add most value to the Group.

+26.7%
Headline (before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items) earnings per share (EPS)
rose by 26.7% to 132.4p
Headline EPS has risen by more than 170.0% since 2000, with 
significant growth achieved in 2003.
+22.6%
Dividend per share rose by 22.6% 
to 38.0p
This year the dividend has increased from 31 .0p to 38.0p. 
Since becoming a pure automotive services group in mid 
1999 the ordinary dividend has risen over 72.0% from 22.0p
per share to 38.0p.
Inchcape plc Annual report 2003
In Business Services we will be concentrating our management
efforts on improving the margins in our UK business before
expanding into Continental Europe.
Given this, a further return of capital to shareholders is not
considered appropriate at this stage. However, if available funds
are not required for investment purposes we will make additional
returns of capital to shareholders.
Dividend
Since becoming a pure automotive services group in mid 1999 
the Board's progressive dividend policy has resulted in an increase
each year. Therefore the Board recommends the payment of a final
ordinary dividend for the year of 26.0p (2002 - 21 .0p). This gives 
a total dividend for the year of 38.0p (2002 - 31 .0p), which is an
increase of 22.6%. The dividend is covered 3.5 times (2002 - 3.4
times) by Headline earnings per share. 
Inchcape management and employees
The management team has had another successful year and 
I would like to congratulate them on once again delivering growth
in shareholder value.
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank all our colleagues
for their dedication, effort and loyalty. The recent success of
Inchcape is in no small part down to them.
Board changes
I am delighted that Michael Wemms joined the Board on 
29 January 2004. Michael brings with him a wealth of retail
experience from his time at T esco plc where he was an Executive
Director from 1989 to 2000. The Group will undoubtedly benefit
from this experience as it extends its Retail operations.
However, I am sorry to announce that Hugh Norton will retire
from the Board at our Annual General Meeting in May 2004. 
Hugh has added significant value to the Group since he joined the
Board in January 1995. I would particularly like to thank him for his
contribution as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. I would
also like to thank Michael Wemms for agreeing to take on this role.
Current trading and prospects
The UK market is expected to remain strong although marginally
down on 2003, which was a record year. In UK Retail the
dealership network and management changes implemented in
2003 should start to drive profits and margins forward. In Business
Services we expect to see a recovery based on actions taken in
2003 and the broader customer offering we now have, which are
already bringing in new business. Inchcape Fleet Solutions should
continue to grow as a result of recently awarded fleet
management contracts. Overall the UK is expected to raise profits
in the year continuing the trend started in 2001 .
In Greece and Belgium the markets should show a slight
improvement due to the Olympic Games in Athens, and the
Brussels Motor Show.
Australia is benefiting from the successful launch in October
2003 of the new Liberty and Outback models.
The Hong Kong market is showing signs of recovery and we
expect this to continue. This should result in improved profitability.
In Singapore it is currently forecast that the Government will
issue fewer Certificates of Entitlement this year and so the market
could be up to 10.0% lower.
This excellent set of results has maintained our recent record 
of reporting profit growth and strong cash generation, and we are
well placed to continue this in 2004 despite the current weakness
of the US dollar. We will also be investing further in our core
markets to take advantage of the significant growth opportunities
available to the Group.
