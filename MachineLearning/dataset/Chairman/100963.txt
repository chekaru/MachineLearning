6   Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
I am delighted to report on another successful
year at Informa in 2008.  Our revenue and
adjusted operating profits grew by 13% and
17% respectively over 2007 with the benefit of
currency translation.  We are pleased that the
Group delivered organic profit growth of 1.4%.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share at 40.32p
grew by 14% over 2007.  With excellent
cash conversion, we generated  205.7m 
(2007:  134.4m) of free cash flow.
Results
Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2008 increased 
by 13% to  1,278.0m (2007:  1,129.1m) with adjusted
operating profit up by 17% to  305.8m (2007:  261.0m).
Adjusted profit before taxation increased by 15% to  233.4m
(2007:  202.6m).
The Group's profit before taxation decreased to  108.9m
(2007:  124.4m) and basic earnings per share decreased to
19.97p (2007: 23.40p) as a result of higher amortisation
charges arising from last year's acquisition of Datamonitor.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 14% to
40.32p (2007: 35.48p).  As a result of excellent adjusted 
cash conversion of 121%, net debt to EBITDA fell from 
4.3 times to 3.8 times.  However as sterling depreciated
materially against the US dollar and the Euro in 2008,
reported net debt at 31 December 2008 increased to
 1,341.8m (31 December 2007:  1,244.9m). 
The long term strategy of the Group is to have a portfolio of
businesses that combine attractive growth characteristics in
periods of economic growth but which also exhibit strong
defensive capabilities when times become tougher.  We have
done well in the former in recent years and we have started
well in the latter but it is unclear how long and how deep 
this downturn will be.  We have built the business as a 
3-dimensional matrix with vertical markets on one axis,
geographies on the second and media distribution formats 
on the third.  Accordingly we operate in over 100 vertical
markets but with considerable strength in Life Sciences,
Healthcare, the Academic world, Telecommunications,
Financial Information, Professional Information and
T ransport.  We are well spread geographically with about
36% of revenue arising in the US, 30% in continental
Europe, 5% in the Middle East, 13% in the UK and 16% in
the rest of the world.  From a media distribution perspective
we have Publishing, and Events and T raining businesses, 
with publishing accounting for about 57% of Group 
adjusted operating profits.  Of these profits the vast majority
comes from subscriptions where generally our customers 
pay annually in advance.  Over 70% of our publishing
revenues are delivered in an electronic format.  Only 3% 
of our revenues come from advertising.
We break our business down into small business units
sometimes geographically and sometimes by format or 
sector, dependent on which is most appropriate.  Such a
structure enables us to monitor the current trading and future
prospects of each of our businesses in a very granular way.
This has enabled us to expand when the going is good but
also to contract if necessary, which we have done on a case 
by case basis over the last 18 months.  It also ensures that
forecasting is based on local, day to day visibility which
remains so important in these most volatile of times.
Reacting quickly is imperative and during 2008 we have
reduced annualised costs by  33 million.  Our success thus
far can be seen by how the Group's adjusted operating margin
has improved from 21.1% in 2006 to 23.1% in 2007 and now
23.9% in 2008.  Cost management is an ongoing process and
we will continue to work to mitigate any revenue softness.
The nature of our business is to link leading publishing 
titles and events in many sectors so that our content is the
prime information source.  With titles such as Lloyd's List,
Insurance Day, BioProcess International, Cityscape Magazine,
Scrip and Banking Technology, we have not only the market
leading title but we also run alongside them the main industry
event.  Right across our business, as appropriate, we cross 
sell and cross market publishing and events and once firmly
established in one geographic jurisdiction we are often able to
spread the events portfolio regionally through geo-cloning. 
As many of the markets are niche and specialist and
accordingly quite small, our leading titles and events will
either be the market leaders or number two in a particular
sector.  This means that, providing our content is fresh,
concise and necessary, we should retain our market share, 
if not increase it, in current conditions as some of our
competitors disappear. 
Out of the thousands of events we run, which include
conferences, training courses and exhibitions, some 200,
accounting for about 70% of the events' profits, are industry
leading events.  These include titles such as Arab Health,
Cityscape Abu Dhabi and Dubai, The German Energy event and the World Ethanol Congress.  It is industry leading
events like these that we expect to hold their own during a
downturn and as competition subsides.  Certainly through
the latter part of 2008 and the first part of 2009, this has
been the case. 
The value of our portfolio approach is that large parts of 
our business continue to do well and in some cases even
outperform in difficult times.  Our publishing businesses
which are mostly subscription based did well last year and 
are in line with internal forecasts so far this year.  As many 
of these businesses are dollar denominated we have benefited
considerably by the strengthening of the US dollar against
sterling.  Our average dollar sterling translation for 2008 on
the publishing side was close to $2 to the pound whereas for
the year to date, the rate is below $1.50.  We already have
29% visibility over the 2009 expected revenue.  In absolute
terms, is 25% more than at the same stage last year.
Debts covenants and dividend
Over the past 12 months, against an increasingly demanding
economic background, the Board has taken steps to protect
profitability, strengthen the Group's balance sheet and
increase focus on cash generation.  The effect of these actions
is apparent in the strength of the Group's profit performance
and its ability to service comfortably its debt obligations.  
The ratio of average net debt proforma to EBITDA was
reduced to 3.8 times at December 2008 from 4.3 times 
at 31 December 2007.
The Board is not expecting any improvement in global macro
economic conditions over the next 12 months.  During 2009
the net debt to EBITDA facility covenant testing level falls
from 4.25 times at December 2008 to 4.0 and 3.5 times at
June and December 2009 respectively (and thereafter remains
at 3.5 times through 2012). 
The Board has focused on the structure of the Group's
balance sheet and ongoing programme of debt reduction.
Based on current forecasts, we expect to have covenant
headroom of above 10% for both the June and December
2009 tests and remain confident that covenants will not 
be breached. 
Given that economic conditions will remain difficult, the
Board has been keen to take prudent steps to create further
covenant headroom and has considered sales of non-core
businesses.  However, the current difficulties for potential
acquirers to fund acquisitions make the outcome of such sale
processes hard to predict and the Board has no desire to sell
quality assets at depressed prices.  The Board will continue 
to pursue opportunities as appropriate, throughout 2009.
The Group's current banking arrangements are keenly priced
and in the event it became necessary to re-negotiate these
arrangements, a significant expense would be incurred.  
The Board is very intent on retaining value for shareholders
within the business.  In the context of the tightening banking
covenants and maintaining a prudent level of covenant
headroom, the Board believes the best course of action is 
to propose a final dividend of 3.9p (2007: 11.3p).  As a 
result the total dividend for 2008 is 10p (2007: 16.9p).  
This will be payable on 3 July 2009 to ordinary shareholders
who are on the register as at 29 May 2009.  This action,
which increases historic dividend cover to over four times, 
is non-dilutive to shareholders, retains over  30m of cash
within the business compared to last year's pay out and
increases covenant headroom by approximately 3%.
It is the Board's intention to pay a 2009 dividend which 
will be covered 3 times by earnings and that the year end
average net debt to proforma EBITDA will be targeted at
below 3 times.  
Current trading and prospects
Informa has a strong portfolio of businesses that balance
geographic and sector exposure and has high quality
subscription based products with high visibility cash flow
streams.  Our overall expectations for 2009 have not changed.
We will not be immune to recession however we expect to
benefit from a more favourable translation of overseas earnings.
We will actively manage our financial position and we believe
we will not break our banking covenants.  This will be assisted
by a reduction in the proposed final dividend for 2008 which
reflects both the importance of protecting shareholder value
and preserving capital.   
Conclusion
The recent interest in Informa shows that our portfolio of
assets are well regarded and in some cases coveted.  Over the
last ten years, almost from a zero base, through a combination
of mergers and acquisitions and substantial organic growth
we have built one of the leading business information groups
in the world.  I would like to thank everybody at Informa
who has contributed to this success.
