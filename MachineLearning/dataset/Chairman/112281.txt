CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2012 
 
 
The Group has now completed its first decade and has been engaged in the design and manufacture of 
scientific instruments for seven and a half years. It gives me much pleasure to be able to report record 
revenues and profits for the seventh consecutive year. 
 
Group revenues for the financial year ended 31 December 2012 registered a 35% advance from  20.8 
million to  28.0 million. This reflects organic growth of 7.5% and includes a full year's contribution from 
Deben UK Limited (Deben ) and a maiden contribution from Global Digital Systems Limited (GDS ). 
 
Profit before tax, exceptional items and minorities, rose by 42% to a record  5.6 million (2011:  3.9 
million), with the operating contribution of the businesses owned as at 1 January 2011 growing by 12.9%. 
Basic earnings per share, before exceptional items, rose by one third, from 61.0p to 81.3p despite the 
dilution caused by the placing and the conversion of most of the Convertible Redeemable shares. Fully 
diluted earnings per share, before exceptional items, progressed 39.5% to 73.5p (2011: 52.7p). 
 
Exceptional items include the amortisation of intangible assets, acquisition expenses and tax relief arising 
from the issue of shares to employees. They also reflect the difference in valuation from one year-end to 
the next of the Convertible Redeemable shares, with the strong progress in the Company's share price 
during 2012 producing an accounting loss of  1.6 million. Your Board regards this accounting charge as 
unrelated to the Group's operating performance and it is therefore treated as an exceptional item. 
Conscious that this artificial loss was an irritation for the investing community, the Board proposed a 
resolution to encourage premature conversion. This was duly adopted at the last AGM and all but 4.2% of 
the original Convertible Redeemable shares were converted before the year-end.  The 2012 IFRS results 
are thankfully the last ones to be significantly affected by this accounting oddity but, of course, exceptional 
items will persist as long as the Group continues to complete acquisitions. 
 
Profit, including exceptional items but before tax and minorities, amounted to  321,000 (2011:  2.9 
million). After tax, this equates to a basic loss per share, including exceptional items, of 4.2p (2011: 45.2p 
earnings). The fully diluted loss per share, after exceptional items, amounted to 4.2p (2011: 42.9p 
earnings). 
 
Corporate activity 
 
On 6 March 2012, Deben completed the purchase of the business of KE Developments Limited (KED). 
KED designs and manufactures accessories for electron microscopes, addressing the same client base 
as Deben. The purchase price will depend on KED's five year sales and will be capped at a maximum of 
 340,000. The business was integrated into Deben during the course of 2012 and is expected to 
contribute to Deben's profitability with effect from 2013. 
 
Also on 6 March 2012, Judges acquired the entire share capital of GDS for a cash consideration of  7.65 
million. GDS designs, manufactures and sells instruments used to test the physical properties of soil and 
rocks. The acquisition was financed by an extension of the facilities provided by Lloyds Bank. It is 
appropriate to recognise the contribution of Lloyds (and Bank of Scotland until their merger into Lloyds) to 
the execution of our strategy and we are grateful for this enduring relationship that has persisted despite 
the recent upheavals within the banking industry; we believe that prudent lending to sensible companies 
to finance profitable projects is available from Lloyds. 
 
In May, the Company restored its ability to complete acquisitions by raising new equity of  3.0 million 
( 2.8 million net of costs). The placing comprised of 500,000 new Ordinary shares priced at 600p and was 
almost three times subscribed. The shares were placed to existing and new institutional holders and to 
some private investors.

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2012 
 
 
Trading in 2012 
 
Overall trading was positive in 2012, particularly in the vacuum division and the Group achieved a healthy 
growth in order intake, sales, profit and cash generation. The newly acquired businesses operated in line 
with management expectations, with a good performance at GDS, including buoyant order intake towards 
the end of the year.  The Group has continued to focus on the updating of its product range. 
 
As expected, the acquisition of GDS, because of its size and the purchase multiple paid, slightly reduced 
the Company's Return On Total Invested Capital which eased from 46.2% to 40.3%. The mechanical 
impact of this large transaction was mitigated by the positive operating performance of GDS and the 
remainder of the Group. 
 
Planning permission was obtained to develop the Stonecross site in Laughton, beyond the area available 
at the time of its purchase, and construction is now under way. On completion in 2013, the businesses of 
UHV Design and of both Quorum locations will be consolidated into one factory, allowing us to improve 
Quorum's operations and profitability. UHV Design will benefit from the additional space it has been 
lacking following its rapid growth of recent years. 
 
Financial position 
 
Net debt as at 31 December 2012 stood at  2.0 million; excluding subordinated amounts owed to minority 
shareholders but including amounts still owed in respect of acquisitions, net debt stood at  1.75 million 
(2011:  0.73 million). The  8.0 million net debt taken on to purchase GDS was eroded by operating cash 
flow of  4.7 million and the  2.8 million proceeds from the placing (net of costs). Capital investment 
increased to  0.9 million primarily due to spending on the new Laughton factory; this will accelerate in 
2013 and the asset will, on completion, be partially refinanced by Lloyds. 
 
Year-end cash balances progressed from  4.0 million to  5.4 million. 
 
Although a significant proportion of our debt is denominated in US dollars and Euros in order to hedge our 
contractual foreign currency exposure, the strength of Sterling during 2012 led to an adverse variance in 
our gross profit margins against budget. At the conclusion of the financial year we elected to hedge our 
2013 budgeted margins through the utilisation of currency options and forward sales contracts.  Should 
the downward trend in Sterling witnessed during the early months of 2013 continue, these measures will 
attenuate the unbudgeted gain that would otherwise accrue. 
 
Dividends 
 
Your Board is pleased to recommend a final dividend of 10.0p per share (2011: 6.7p per share) which, 
subject to approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting on 29 May 2013, will make a total 
distribution of 15.0p per share for 2012 (2011: 10.0p per share). Despite the proposed increase, the 
dividend total is still covered more than five times by adjusted earnings per share. If the proposed 
dividend is approved, the total of all dividends paid by the Company since its incorporation will amount to 
46.4p, almost half of the 95p invested by the original shareholders at the time of the flotation in January 
2003. 
 
The proposed final dividend will be payable on 5 July 2013 to shareholders on the register on 7 June 2013 
and the shares will go ex-dividend on 5 June 2013.

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2012 
 
 
Share Incentive Plan 
 
During 2012, the Company launched a Share Incentive Plan (SIP) to enable all employees with a 
minimum of 12 months' service to purchase shares in a tax efficient manner up to a value of  1,500 per 
annum, commencing in April 2012. In the SIP's first tax year, the Company matched, pound-for-pound, 
individual employees' investments of up to  600 and this will be repeated in 2013/2014. This scheme 
provides an opportunity for employees, who work hard to support the Group's progress, to have a share in 
the value that they help to create. The Board is pleased that 67 Group employees, approximately one-
third of eligible staff, have elected to participate in the SIP and it is particularly gratifying that the early 
participants have already benefited from the momentum in the Company's share price. 
 
As ever, we are grateful to our employees for their ingenuity and hard work which has contributed so 
decisively to the results that we are able to announce this year. 
 
Current trading and prospects 
 
The global economic background may well show some improvement in 2013. Trading conditions in 
Europe are lacklustre rather than dire, there are plausible grounds for anticipating some recovery in the 
US but the onus for significant growth still lies essentially with the developing nations. With Sterling 
retreating from its 2012 gains, our export-dominated sector, resilient at the worst of times, may enjoy a 
more benign trading environment than in the recent past. The new year has started well for the Group and 
a solid order intake is buttressing the visibility afforded by the satisfactory year-end backlog.
