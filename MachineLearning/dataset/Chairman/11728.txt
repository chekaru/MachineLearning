2008 Review and Results 
 
During the first half of 2008, the outlook for the world economy started to deteriorate due to increasing fears of 
recession and stagflation.  The commodity markets were characterised by sharp increases in the prices of energy 
products, particularly oil, and by the record contracted prices achieved by the major mining groups for steaming 
and coking coal.  Despite these high energy costs the price of uranium remained subdued.  
 
The setback in mining stock markets in the early part of the year turned into a major collapse of prices in the 
autumn as banking and financial problems developed into a worldwide liquidity and credit crisis. This 
uncertainty has kept the price of gold buoyant. 
 
Against this background the Group has benefited from the strength of its diversified strategic interests, with a 
continued emphasis on energy, precious metals and coal.  Critically, the Group has remained focused on 
securing new royalties.  In this respect, during the year, the Group acquired two new gold royalties in Spain and 
Brazil at a cost of C$7.5 million and A$4 million. 
 
Whilst the Group's strategic quoted mining investments have fallen in value in line with the mining markets as a 
whole, coal royalty receipts for the year have been at record levels.  Furthermore, the sharp falls in the prices of 
junior mining stocks and collapse in metal prices has all but closed the normal sources of finance available to 
small mining companies.  This has resulted in more opportunities for the Group to secure new royalties. 
 
With coking coal prices trebling to nearly US$300 per ton, the group received from the Kestrel and Crinum 
mines in Queensland record coal royalties of  22.1 million (A$48 million) compared to  8.4 million in 2007.  
With the prospect of lower coking coal prices in 2009, the value of the Group's coal royalty interests has 
declined to  93.3 million from  96.8 million at 30
th
 June 2008, but is still substantially higher than the valuation 
of  60.9 million as at 31
st
 December 2007.  Anglo Pacific Group PLC

CHAIRMAN'S REVIEW

Due to the reduction in liquidity and sharp falls in junior mining markets, the Group realised reduced profits on 
the sale of mining and exploration interests of  14.0 million (2007:  25.6 million).  The value of the Group's 
quoted and unquoted strategic interests and cash as at 31
st
 December 2008 was  70.7 million (2007:  114.7 
million).  The Group remains cash generative and in a strong financial position, being well capitalised and debt 
free. 
 
Earnings for the year were 27.56p per share compared to 28.72p per share in 2007. 
 
With a background of overwhelming recessionary forces in the markets as well as uncertainty over the future 
pricing of coking coal, the Group has decided to keep its final dividend unchanged at 4.35p per share (2007: 
4.35p).  However, total dividends for the year increased by 6% to 7.80p (2007: 7.35p). 
 
The Group's strategic interests, which include quoted and unquoted investments and other royalties, were 
valued at 31
st
 December 2008 at  53.5 million compared to  95.8 million a year ago.  This valuation includes all 
the private mining interests which remain in the financial statements at cost.  In British Columbia work has 
continued on both the Groundhog and Trefi coalfields where drilling programmes are planned and dialogue with 
local interest groups continues.  The Group intends to prove up a compliant resource statement for Trefi during 
2009. 
 
At 31
st
 December 2008 the Group had no borrowings and over  17 million of cash in the bank.  The Group's 
mining interests and royalty revenues are mainly denominated in US, Canadian and Australian dollars and its 
liquid resources are held in a spread of currencies and banks. 
 
Strategy and Progress 
 
The Group's strategy remains focused on securing new royalties by acquisition and through investment in its 
mining interests in order to generate strong cashflows and continue to pay dividends to its shareholders. 
 
  In March 2008 the Group agreed a 2.5% royalty for C$7.5 million from Kinbauri Gold Corp. on its 
gold deposit in northern Spain, subject to due diligence.  The royalty increases to 3% in the event that 
the gold price exceeds US$1,100 an ounce.  This deal completed in October 2008. 
 
  In September 2008 the Group agreed a 2.5% gold royalty with Mundo Minerals Ltd on its producing 
Engenho mine in Brazil for A$4 million, subject to due diligence.  The deal completed in November 
2008.  The Group has been a significant shareholder in Mundo Minerals for some time and was 
therefore in a position to provide finance for working capital when a short term production shortfall 
affected cashflow.  The first royalty payment from this investment has recently been received. 
 
  In December 2008 the Group agreed, subject to due diligence, to acquire a 2% net smelter royalty for 
A$5 million with Indo Mines Ltd, developer of the Jogjakarta iron sands project in Indonesia.  The 
funds will be principally used to complete the feasibility study and to acquire additional iron sands 
properties.  The Group has been and continues to be a significant shareholder in Indo Mines and was 
the first port of call to provide finance when the normal sources of capital were unavailable. 
 
  Two further royalties are currently under negotiation and subject to due diligence processes. 
 
  The Group's strategic interests, cash and royalty receivables were valued at 31
st
 December 2008 at 
 82.2 million (2007:  116.5 million).  The recent valuation of the Group's coal royalties raises the 
Group's total assets to  176.4 million with no debt.  This does not include any excess over cost 
attributable to the real value of the Group's substantial private coal and other mining interests in British 
Columbia and Australia.   Anglo Pacific Group PLC

The Group's quoted equity interests disclosed on the LSE, ASX and TSX, where initial equity stake disclosure 
levels are 3%, 5% and 10% respectively, amount to  29 million in twenty three different holdings.  The balance 
of quoted holdings of  5 million is made up of a further twenty one incubator investments.  The split of the 
Group's strategic interests by commodity is now on the Group's website at www.anglopacificgroup.com where 
all the equity disclosures can also be accessed. 
 
Subject to approval at the AGM to be held in London on 23
rd
 April 2009, the 2008 final dividend of 4.35p per 
share will be paid to shareholders on 3
rd
 July 2009.  This brings the total dividends for the year to 7.80p (2007: 
7.35p).  Depending on the share price at the time, the Board will consider whether shareholders will again be 
given the opportunity to elect to receive a scrip dividend instead of cash. 
 
Outlook 
 
Recent months have seen many of the major mining companies closing down their marginal mines as well as 
cutting back on planned capital expenditure on new and existing projects.  This has and will continue to reduce 
supply of metal to world markets.  When the recovery in demand starts this should lead to higher commodity 
prices. 
 
The timing of this recovery and in particular the future demand for steel products will determine the price of 
coking coal for the next year or two.  The extent to which governments around the world promote infrastructure 
projects to revive their economies will also prove an important factor. 
 
The collapse in the junior quoted mining sector has made project finance very difficult to raise from 
conventional lenders or through the stock market without severe dilution for shareholders.  This environment 
has produced many opportunities and the Group is confident that, with conservative management of its cash and 
other resources, it can maintain its strategic focus to achieve new royalty flows and continue to pay dividends. 
 
Finally, I would like to thank shareholders for their support and directors and staff for their hard work during a 
challenging year.
