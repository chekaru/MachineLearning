Chairman's Statement
This has been another 
year of continued 
revenue growth for 
Laura Ashley despite a 
difficult market.
I am encouraged to 
see the strong like-for-
like growth across all 
categories.
Overview
This has been another year of 
continued revenue growth for Laura 
Ashley despite a difficult market. 
I am encouraged to see the strong 
like-for-like growth across all 
categories, particularly Furniture, and 
to see the important role that 
E-commerce continues to play in 
driving growth.
2009 witnessed a period of 
consolidation in the marketplace 
following the uncertainties of 2008. 
Customer confidence is returning but 
is tempered with a degree of 
caution. Laura Ashley is confident 
that its strong balance sheet, strong 
brand and distinctive product 
offering will provide a platform for 
continued growth in 2010.
For the 52 weeks to 30 January 2010, 
profit before tax was up 7.8% to 
 11.0 million (2009:  10.2 million). 
Excluding gains from exceptional 
items, profit was up 5.2% to 
 10.1 million (2009:  9.6 million).
Profit from continuing operations  
was up 10.9% to  11.2 million  
(2009:  10.1 million). This excludes  
our share of loss from our associate 
company arising from an impairment 
charge in that associate company.
Total Group sales increased by 
 7.9 million (3.0%) to  268.4 million 
(52 weeks) compared to the previous 
year of  260.5 million (53 weeks).   
The improved total sales position 
was primarily due to the increase  
in UK store sales and Internet sales.  
For the year ended 30 January 2010, 
total UK store sales were up 3.1%  
to  213.5 million (LFL +3.0%) whilst 
Internet sales grew by 30.0% to 
 22.1 million. An additional 16,000 
selling square feet (1.8%) was added 
to the UK portfolio.
Gross margin declined by 
1.8 percentage points against 
last year mainly due to the weakness 
of Sterling and planned promotional 
activity. Operating expenses have 
decreased by 3.2% to  104.3 million 
(2009:  107.8 million) due to our  
successful cost-control measures.
The Board has recommended a  
final dividend of 0.75 pence per 
share. When taken with the interim 
dividend of 0.25 pence per share 
(paid on 12 November 2009), the 
total dividend for the year will be  
1.0 pence per share (20% of nominal 
value) (2009: 1.25 pence per share 
(25% of nominal value)). FURNITURE 7

Chairman's Statement continued
Product
The UK business is split into four 
main categories. For the financial 
year ended 30 January 2010, the 
relative split of UK sales is as follows: 
Furniture 30%, Home Accessories 
28%, Decorating 22% and Fashion 
20%. 
Furniture
The Furniture product category 
includes beds, upholstered furniture, 
mirrors and cabinet furniture.
In spite of challenging economic 
conditions, total Furniture sales 
increased 18.2% (LFL +13.8%) for  
the year ended 30 January 2010. 
Upholstered furniture and cabinet 
furniture sales grew at the same rate. 
We were encouraged by the strong 
performance of Furniture through  
the E-Commerce channel which  
saw growth of 36% year-on-year 
helped by the addition of our online 
bespoke service.
The growth in furniture was driven  
by the success of range expansions, 
updates and re-colourations of our 
best sellers, planned promotional 
activity and improved stock 
management.
New product additions to our 
popular ranges continue to drive 
sales forward, as has the introduction 
of more innovative products. 
Home Accessories 
The Home Accessories product 
category includes lighting, gifts, 
bed linen, rugs, throws, cushions 
and children's accessories.
During the year ended 30 January 
2010, sales of Home Accessories 
increased by 5.5% (LFL +1.6%). 
We continue to innovate in this 
category. Our fragrance ranges have 
proven to be very popular, as have 
our updated children's ranges. Our 
expanded Christmas offer performed
strongly in the season. We have built 
on our signature lighting offer with 
new distinctive pieces. New bed 
linen and cushion designs have also 
driven positive sales momentum. 
Decorating
This category includes curtains, 
fabric, paint, decorative accessories 
and wall coverings.
During the year ended 30 January 
2010, Decorating sales were up  
9.5% (LFL +6.2%).
Previous investment in a new 
wallpaper printing machine has 
enabled continued success in this 
category as we react quickly to 
changing trends and can restock 
mid-season. Re-colourations of best 
sellers, shorter lead-times and 
distinctive statement wallpapers 
continue to drive this category. 
Our new online Made to Measure 
curtains offer has also been 
particularly popular. 
Fashion
For the year ended 30 January 2010, 
UK retail fashion sales increased by 
12.9% (LFL +9.8%) in what continued 
to be a highly competitive consumer 
environment. During the year, nine 
stores were converted from Home to 
Mixed Product stores giving an 
additional 14,000 square feet to 
fashion trading.
Our fashion product offering 
continues to be successful. Our 
proven best selling shapes and 
colours have continued to sell well.
New ranges and products, such as 
the cape and the all-in-one trouser 
suit, were in high demand from 
our customers, as was our nightwear 
range.
The accessories range has been very 
popular, particularly scarves and 
jewellery. 
The growth in furniture 
was driven by the 
success of range 
expansions, updates 
and re-colourations of 
our best sellers, 
planned promotional 
activity and improved 
stock management. Annual Report 2010  laura ashley holdings plc 8

UK Retail
As at 30 January 2010, the property 
portfolio in the UK comprised 231 
stores (2009: 228). We have four main 
store types: 137 Mixed Product 
stores (selling all product categories), 
62 Home stores (selling Home 
products only), 28 Home concession 
stores and 4 Clearance outlets. 
Nine Home stores were converted  
to Mixed Product stores. A further 
21 stores, 9% of the UK portfolio, 
underwent space-flexing to optimise 
profitability and give a more relevant 
and popular product offering.
During the year ended 30 January 
2010, we opened 6 new stores and 
closed 3 stores. As a result, total 
selling space increased by 1.8% to 
886,000 square feet.
We introduced our first branded 
Laura Ashley Gift & Accessory store. 
Located at Liverpool Street train 
station, we have had extremely 
positive customer feedback to this 
model. We will continue to review its 
performance with a view to adding 
such stores to the portfolio as 
suitable locations arise.
We remain committed to our store 
realignment programme in 2010 and, 
as previously, it will continue to be 
subject to our rigorous property 
selection criteria. The realignment 
will focus on the acquisition of 
smaller, new concept stores and 
optimising space in our existing 
portfolio to drive additional density.
Our E-Commerce and Mail Order 
channels remain a vital part of  
our multi-channel retail strategy, 
representing 12% of total UK retail 
sales. Total E-Commerce and Mail 
Order sales were up 7% on last year. 
Within this figure and reflecting the 
trend we have seen over recent 
years, E-Commerce sales were  
up 30.0%, more than compensating 
for an ongoing market decline in 
Mail Order sales. The online offer  
has been greatly enhanced with  
the addition during the year of the  
Made to Measure curtains and  
Made to Order upholstery categories. 
We remain committed 
to our store realignment 
programme in 2010. 
Our E-Commerce and 
Mail Order channels 
remain a vital part of 
our multi-channel retail 
strategy, representing 
12% of total UK retail 
sales.

International Operations
Our international franchising 
operations continue to be an 
important part of the Laura Ashley 
business and, as at 30 January 2010, 
there were 230 (2009: 223) franchised 
stores in 26 (2009: 25) countries 
worldwide. This includes 6 stores in 
China and 3 stores in Dubai, with a 
view to opening additional stores 
elsewhere in the Gulf States.
Franchise revenues fell by 5.6% to 
 19.4 million as most partners have 
continued to be affected by the 
global economic downturn.
Licensing income increased 1.0% to 
 3.1 million. Licences were awarded 
during 2009 for new categories, 
which included wooden flooring, 
fireplaces and shutters. 
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 0.75 pence per share. 
When taken with the interim dividend 
of 0.25 pence per share paid on 
12 November 2009, this takes the total 
dividend for the year to 1.0 pence 
per share (2009: 1.25 pence per share).  
This dividend will be proposed at the 
AGM on 7 June 2010 and subject to 
shareholder approval, will be paid on 
4 August 2010 to all shareholders on 
the register at the close of business 
on 2 July 2010.
The Board will continue to review 
dividend payments on the basis of 
annual profitability, the economic 
climate and the needs of 
the business.
Our international 
franchising operations 
continue to be an 
important part of the 
Laura Ashley business 
and, as at 30 January 
2010, there were 230 
franchised stores in 26 
countries worldwide.
