Total Group sales increased by

compared to the previous year of

space was reduced by 27,000 square 
feet (3.2%), as the UK portfolio was 
reduced by 6 stores, from 217 to 211.
In spite of greater supplier costs due 
to the increases in commodity costs, 
gross margin rates were maintained 
at last year's levels. Operating 
expenses increased by 2.0% to 
 107.7 million (2011:  105.6 million).
Cash Flow and Balance

Cash generated from operations in 
the year was  24.4 million (2011: 
 29.1 million). The net decrease in 
cash balances over the year was 
 3.5 million with the Group holding 
 35.0 million in cash as at the year

marketing development cost  5.8m. 
Dividend payments in the year 
increased by  5.4m. 
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 1.0 pence per share. 
When taken with the interim 
dividend of 1.0 pence per share paid 
on 10 November 2011, this takes the 
total dividend for the year to 2.0 pence  
per share (2011: Total dividend of 
1.5 pence per share). This dividend will  
be proposed at the AGM on 11 June 
2012 and, subject to shareholders' 
approval, will be paid on 11 July 2012  
to all shareholders on the Register at 
the close of business on 15 June 2012.  
The ex-dividend date will be on 
13 June 2012.
The Board will continue to review 
dividend payments on the basis of 
annual profitability, the economic 
climate and the needs of the 
business. FURNITURE  LAURA ASHLEY HOLDINGS PLC  Annual Report 2012 7

UK Retail
As at 28 January 2012, the property 
portfolio in the UK comprised 211 
stores (2011: 217). We have five store 
types: 134 Mixed Product stores 
(selling all product categories), 
54 Home stores (selling Home 
products only), 21 Home concession 
stores, 1 Gifts & Accessories store 
and 1 Clearance outlet. 
During the year ended 28 January 
2012, we opened 1 new store and 
closed 7 stores. As a result, total 
selling space fell by 3.2% to 806,000 
square feet. The store closures are 
part of the ongoing store portfolio 
realignment programme, which is 
focussed on optimising profitability. 
The realignment will also focus on 
the acquisition of smaller, new 
concept stores and optimising space 
in our existing portfolio to drive 
additional density. 
Our E-Commerce channel remains a 
key part of our multi-channel retail 
strategy, contributing 13.8% of total 
UK retail sales (12.3% of total Group 
sales). This has increased from 12.5% 
of total UK Retail sales last year 
(11.2% of total Group sales). Total 
E-Commerce and Mail Order sales 
were up 4.9% on last year. Within this 
figure and reflecting the trend we 
have seen over recent years, 
E-Commerce sales were up 10.4%, 
more than compensating for an 
ongoing market decline in Mail 
Order sales. Laura Ashley now 
delivers its full product range to 
Germany, Austria, Italy and 
Switzerland, in addition to the UK. 
Considerable functional 
enhancement was added to the 
website during 2011 giving the 
customer greater ease of navigation 
and showcasing the entire range of 
bespoke upholstery products.

Product
The UK business is split into four 
main categories. For the financial 
year ended 28 January 2012, the 
relative split of UK sales is as follows: 
Furniture 30%, Home Accessories 
27%, Decorating 23% and Fashion 
20%. Over 40% of our home 
furnishings ranges are manufactured 
in the UK.
Furniture
The Furniture product category 
includes beds, upholstered furniture, 
mirrors and cabinet furniture.
Total Furniture sales increased 0.9% 
(LFL +4.1%) for the year ended 
28 January 2012.
The continued success of the 
furniture offer is based on both 
classic shapes and the introduction 
of more contemporary pieces. The 
bed category has expanded 
successfully during the last year as 
we now offer a comprehensive range 
at very competitive lead times. 
Mirrors continue to be a signature 
product within the range.
Home Accessories 
The Home Accessories product 
category includes lighting, gifts, bed 
linen, rugs, throws, cushions, and 
children's accessories.
During the year ended 28 January 
2012, sales of Home Accessories 
decreased by 3.9% (LFL -0.2%). 
In an increasingly competitive 
category, we managed to perform 
significantly better than the market 
during the past year. We have added 
new products to the range including 
tea, coffee, hot chocolate and 
biscuits, all of which outperformed 
our expectations. We also grew our 
Christmas offer to very positive 
customer response. Our inspirational 
lighting, bed linen and soft 
furnishings continue to be key 
components in our coordinated 
lifestyle offer.
Decorating
This category includes curtains, 
blinds, fabric, paint, decorative 
accessories and wall coverings.
During the year ended 28 January 
2012, Decorating sales were up 1.6% 
(LFL +4.7%).
Distinctive, contemporary prints and 
traditional floral designs in both 
fabric and wallpaper combined to 
give us a very strong performance in 
the category during the past year.  
Our ability to both respond to and 
set trends gives us a significant 
market advantage. Our diverse mix 
of designs, treatments and finishes 
has enabled us to continue to grow 
our curtains and blinds business - all 
made to bespoke requirements in 
the UK.
Fashion
For the year ended 28 January 2012, 
UK retail fashion sales increased by 
2.7% (LFL +5.6%). 
In addition to building on the 
success of previous designs and 
shapes, we continue to embrace 
fashions trends whilst ensuring that 
the Laura Ashley handwriting is 
maintained and enhanced.
A new range of perfumery and 
associated products has been 
developed and was launched during 
Autumn 2011 to favourable customer 
response. Comprising three signature 
fragrances, this has added to our 
growing fashion accessory category.

Current Trading and 
Outlook
In what continues to be a very 
competitive consumer environment, 
I am pleased that we have 
maintained the progress of recent 
years and delivered a resilient set of 
results, maintaining gross margin and 
seeing continued like-for-like sales 
growth across the retail business.
A strong performance in the first half 
of the year was followed by a more 
challenging Autumn; we did however 
see a return to stronger trading 
towards the end of 2011 with a  
positive trend in like-for-like sales 
growth.
For the first 8 weeks of the current 
financial year to 24 March 2012,  
like-for-like sales growth is 10.9%
Laura Ashley's success stems from  
its high quality product offering and 
distinctive style, which is based on 
the brand's rich design heritage and 
contemporary interpretations. As we 
expand internationally, we are proud 
that over 40% of our sales is derived 
from products manufactured in the 
UK.
Acknowledgements
I wish to convey my sincere 
appreciation to the staff and 
management of the Group for their 
dedication and commitment as well 
as to my fellow Board members for 
their continuing support and counsel. 
I would also like to extend my 
heartfelt gratitude to our customers, 
suppliers and shareholders for their 
support, loyalty and confidence in 
the Group.
