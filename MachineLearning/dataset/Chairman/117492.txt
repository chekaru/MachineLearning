Dividend
The Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 1.0 pence per share.

paid on 30 October 2012, this takes

UK Retail: Stores
As at 26 January 2013, the property 
portfolio in the UK comprised 212 
stores (2012: 211). We have five store 
types: 135 Mixed Product stores 
(selling all product categories), 
50 Home stores (selling Home 
products only), 23 Home concession 
stores, 3 Gifts & Accessories stores 
and 1 Clearance outlet. 
During the year ended 26 January 
2013, we opened 6 new stores and 
closed 5 stores. As a result, total 
selling space fell by 0.5% to 
802,000 square feet. The store 
openings/closures are part of an 
ongoing store portfolio realignment 
programme, which is focussed on 
optimising profitability. 
UK Retail: E-commerce
Our E-Commerce channel remains a 
key part of our multi-channel retail 
strategy, contributing 16.0% of total 
UK retail sales (14.1% of total Group 
sales). This has increased from 13.8% 
of total UK Retail sales last year 
(12.3% of total Group sales). Total 
E-Commerce and Mail Order sales 
were up 16.4% on last year. Within 
this figure and reflecting the trend 
we have seen over recent years, 
E-Commerce sales were up 19.6%, 
more than compensating for an 
ongoing market decline in Mail 
Order sales. Laura Ashley now 
delivers its full product range to 
France, Germany, Austria, Italy and 
Switzerland, in addition to the UK.  
A mobile site, offering the complete 
range of our products, was added to 
the digital platform during the year. 
This combined with the introduction 
of a  Click and Collect' service and 
continued functional enhancement, 
have helped the E-Commerce 
business continue the growth of 
recent years.

Product
The UK business is split into four 
main categories. For the 
financial year ended 26 January 2013, 
the relative split of UK sales is as 
follows: Furniture 30%, Home 
Accessories 28%, Decorating 23% 
and Fashion 19%. 
Over 40% of our home furnishings 
sales are from products 
manufactured in the UK.
Furniture
The Furniture product category 
includes beds, upholstered furniture, 
mirrors and cabinet furniture.
Total Furniture sales increased by 
0.5% (LFL +1.4%) for the year ended 
26 January 2013.
We are pleased to have achieved 
good like-for-like growth in our most 
price sensitive category. Our success 
is based on the rich and diverse 
range of shapes and fabrics in our 
upholstery ranges. Classic, versatile, 
well-proportioned wooden furniture 
ranges underpin this core category 
for us.
Home Accessories 
The Home Accessories product 
category includes lighting, gifts, 
bed linen, rugs, throws, cushions, 
and children's accessories.
During the year ended 26 January 
2013, sales of Home Accessories 
increased by 7.6% (LFL +8.5%). 
The growth in this category is based 
on a balanced and comprehensive 
lighting collection, which features a 
unique custom made shade 
proposition and our increasingly 
popular printed bed linen. 
Additionally, our accessory ranges 
have become more relevant for 
gifting, therefore allowing us to take 
more advantage of key holiday and 
seasonal events.
Decorating
This category includes curtains, 
blinds, fabric, paint, decorative 
accessories and wall coverings.
During the year ended 26 January 
2013, Decorating sales were up by 
0.7% (LFL +1.6%).
Our entire Home range stems from 
decorating, our signature category.  
It remains both the inspiration and 
building block for all we do. The 
breadth of offer, distinctive design 
direction and co-ordinated approach 
continues to differentiate us from the 
rest of the high street.
Fashion
For the year ended 26 January 2013, 
UK retail fashion sales decreased by 
5.6% (LFL -4.8%). 
Despite a disappointing second half 
performance in Fashion, we are 
taking measures to enhance and 
improve the entire offering. We are 
talking to our customers and feel 
confident that, in an increasingly 
competitive category, our design  
and quality are moving in the 
right direction.
During Autumn 2012, the signature 
Laura Ashley fragrance  Number 1' 
was relaunched. Last sold during the 
1990s, the relaunch was an immediate 
success. A small range of associated 
products is being developed and  
will be available to customers later 
this year. 
Our entire Home range 
stems from decorating, 
 
It remains both the 
inspiration and building

and will be officially launched as a

matter of months. A showcase for 
Laura Ashley, its product, design 
service and brand, the hotel is

Current Trading and 
Outlook
I am pleased that we have 
maintained the progress of recent 
years and delivered another strong 
set of results. Continued like-for-like 
growth across retail, bolstered by 
strong performances from both our 
online and international businesses, 
have helped to deliver 9.2% growth 
in profit before tax. We are confident 
that, despite an extremely 
competitive retail sector and a 
challenging consumer environment, 
both our business and brand are able 
to continue the steady and robust 
progress of recent years. As we 
continue to expand both globally 
and online, we believe that our 
quality product ranges, based on 
sixty years of innovative design and a 
rich brand heritage, underpin the 
foundations of our future growth. 
In the first two months of the current 
financial year, we have achieved  
like-for-like sales growth of 2.7%.  
This is an encouraging start to the 
year and we are confident that this 
progress can be maintained.
Acknowledgements
The success of the Group is due in 
no small part to the hard work and 
commitment of the staff, 
management and my fellow board 
members. For this I wish to convey 
my thanks and appreciation.
For their continued support and 
loyalty to the Group, I would like to 
thank our customers, suppliers and 
shareholders.
