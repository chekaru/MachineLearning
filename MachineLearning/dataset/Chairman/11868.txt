Chairman's Statement 
 
On behalf of the Board of Directors of Anglo-Eastern Plantations Plc, I am pleased to present to you the 2009 Annual 
Report and Audited Financial Statements detailing the performance and operations of the Group and the Company 
for the year ended 31 December 2009. 
 
Performance 
For the year ended 31 December 2009, revenue was $150.1 million compared to $174.7 million in 2008. This 
generated a group operating profit for 2009, before biological asset (BA) adjustment of $59.0 million, 20% less than 
in 2008. Estates fresh fruit bunch (FFB) output for 2009 was 9% above the previous year.  
 
Profit before tax and after BA adjustment was $62.1 million, compared to $77.9 million in 2008. The BA adjustment 
was a credit of $0.9 million, compared to a credit of $1.3 million in 2008, reflecting our estate valuations. 
 
Earnings per share before BA adjustment decreased by 8.6% to 94.11 cts, compared to 103.0 cts in 2008. 
 
The group's balance sheet remains strong. The group continued to experience strong cash flow generation for 2009, 
enabling it to have strong cash reserves and reduce its borrowings. As at 31 December 2009, the group had a cash 
position of $63.8 million and lower borrowings of $27.0 million, giving it a net cash position of $36.8 million, 
compared to $33.8 million in 2008.  
 
During the year, we have repaid $8.6 million out of our existing borrowings of $35.6 million. 
 
Corporate Development 
In 2009, we succeeded in getting the crucial land conversion permit from the Indonesian Forestry Department in 
Central Kalimantan project.  
 
We hope to plant up to 5,000 hectares in Central Kalimantan 2010. We have set a target to plant up to 10,900 
hectares for the group in 2010 and 10,000 hectares per year for the next five years. This means we shall be able to 
more than double the current area of 45,000 hectares to 100,000 hectares by 2014. In 2010, we acquired PT 
Kahayan with the initial Izin Lokasi  area of 17,500 hectares. 
 
The new Sumindo mill (45 MT/hour) is expected to be commissioned in the second quarter of 2010. In 2010, 
Blankahan oil mill's milling capacity shall be increased from the current 25 MT/hour to 40 MT/hour.

Chairman's Statement 
 
Corporate Social Responsibility 
Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is an integral part of corporate self-regulation incorporated into our business 
model. Our group embraces responsibility for the impact of its activities on the environment, consumers, employees, 
communities, stakeholders and all other members of the public sphere. In engaging the social dimension of CSR, the 
Group's business has taken cognizance of the contribution and further enrichment of its employees while continuing 
to make contributions to improve the well being of the surrounding community.  
 
We are in the preliminary stage of moving towards the RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) standards.This 
multinational multi-stakeholder organisation, founded by the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF ), is focused 
upon delivering certified sustainable palm oil to the world market through one of the world's most comprehensive 
certification program for agricultural products. This initiative is focused on protecting and enhancing the principles of 
people, planet and profit for the benefit of all. RSPO principles are clearly stated under the Statement on Corporate 
Governance  
 
Care For The Environment 
As a group, we equally highlight the importance of creating awareness and implementation of good environmental 
management practices throughout the organisation. The Group has been consistently practising good agricultural 
practices such as zero burning, integrated pest management, land terracing and recycling of biomass and reducing 
fossil fuel consumption. 
 
Invest In People 
Our employees are our major asset and here at Anglo-Eastern Plantations Plc, we value their trust and support. We 
make it our responsibility to improve their quality of life as we always believe the right employee training, 
development and education, at the right time, provides returns for the employer in increased productivity, knowledge, 
loyalty, and contribution to the group 
 
Outlook 
Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB) production as of February 2010 was lower by 8% against the same period in 2009. The 
abnormal low cropping trend appears to be nationwide and mainly caused by adverse weather conditions compared 
to the same period in 2009. It is too early to forecast whether the performance will be better for the rest of the year. 
  
The CIF (Cost, Insurance, Freight) Rotterdam CPO (Crude Palm Oil) price opened the year 2009 at $495/mt and 
ended the year at $780/mt, averaging $679/mt for the year. Low interest rates, non-traditional monetary easing, 
extremely accommodative fiscal policy coupled with a weak US dollar have generated considerable liquidity into the 
global economy and this together with the increased demand from China and India have helped underpin the 
commodity prices.  
Oil World has revised its 2010 CPO production forecasts upward for Indonesia to 22.4m tonnes and exports at 17m 
tonnes, while for Malaysia CPO production forecasts were revised downward to 18m tonnes, while exports were 
revised down to 16m tonnes. With the latest revisions, Oil World expects 2010 global CPO production growth of 
5.6% (from 4.4% growth in 2009) and demand growth of 5.8% (from 5.1% demand growth for 2009), which results in 
a lower global stock/usage ratio for CPO of 12% (from 15.2% in 2009 and 15.9% from 2008). This is positive for the 
CPO price. 
The US dollar depreciated by approximately 15% against the Indonesian Rupiah during 2009. Indonesian Rupiah 
has not experienced adverse fluctuations against the US dollar during early 2010. We expect a stable exchange 
level to be attainable for the rest of the year. To mitigate the exposure to currency exchange volatility, the group is 
managing its cash in dollar and local currencies prudently, taking into consideration its dollar-denominated 
borrowings and operational cost currency requirements.

Chairman's Statement 
 
Outlook - continued 
Prospects for 2010 should be cautiously optimistic in view of the higher CPO price during 1Q2010 due to a global 
economic recovery. Indonesia's economy has been resilient through the downturn while current political 
developments now pave the way for economic policies to underpin long term sustainable growth, with strong support 
from the government in palm oil industries. The group is confident that CPO demand will be sustainable in view of a 
global economy recovery and we can expect a satisfactory profit level and cash flow for 2010. 
 
Dividends 
The board is mindful that the group's development programme will require a considerable capital commitment. In this 
respect, the dividend level needs to be balanced against the planned capital expenditure. The board is proposing to 
declare a final dividend of 5.0cts in respect of 2009 (5.0cts in 2008). Shareholders choosing to receive their dividend 
in Sterling will do so at the rate ruling on 30 April 2010, when the register closes. Based on the exchange rate at 15 
March 2010 of $1.5052/ , the proposed dividend would be equivalent to 3.3p, compared to 3.0p declared in respect 
of 2008. 
 
Acknowledgment 
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to convey our sincerest thanks to our Directors, Management and all 
employees of the Group for their strong dedication, loyalty, resourcefulness, commitment and contribution to the 
success of the Group. The year ahead will continue to be challenging given the turbulence of the global market. With 
similar commitment, perseverance and effort as exhibited in the past, I am certain we can deliver a good level of 
performance to all our shareholders. 
 
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the shareholders, business associates, government authorities and 
all other stakeholders for their continued confidence, understanding and support for the Group.
