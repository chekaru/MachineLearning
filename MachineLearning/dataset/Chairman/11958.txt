 Chairman's Statement
 
Annual Report 2013 | Anglo-Eastern Plantations Plc 9 
The past year has been extremely challenging. Crude Palm Oil (CPO ) price declined to a 3-year low in January 
2013 on expectation of a bumper soybean harvest and rising palm oil inventories. It experienced further volatility as 
the Indian Rupee tumbled past 64 Rupee per dollar on concerns that foreign outflows would accelerate as the US 
Federal Reserve prepared to trim monetary stimulus. The depreciation in Rupee put some pressure on the imports of 
palm oil of which India is the largest importer. The Indian government also raised import duties on CPO and refined 
bleached and deodorized palm oils (RBD ) after much lobbying by local refiners as former tariffs encouraged the 
import of larger volumes of RBD for direct sale than CPO for domestic processing.  
 
CPO price gradually recovered some ground in the last quarter of 2013 as higher seasonal rainfall interrupted Fresh 
Fruit Bunch (FFB ) production in Indonesia and Malaysia resulting in lower CPO inventory.  
 
The Group's revenue was $201.9 million, compared to $237.4 million achieved in 2012, a decline of 15% which was 
accounted largely by the decline in CPO price over the period. The average CPO price in 2013 was $857/mt, 14% 
lower than the figure of $995/mt in 2012, but ended the year at $905/mt. 
 
FFB production for 2013 was 787,500mt, 1% higher than the previous year (2012: 783,400mt) with a 5% increase in 
matured trees. Yields remained low due primarily to the lagged effect from dry weather in 2011 affecting trees over 
15 years and also heavy monsoon rain in the early and later part of 2013 which caused logistical problems. Lorries 
were unable to transport FFB to mills as roads were either cut off from flooding or too muddy. FFB bought-in from 
surrounding smallholders during 2013 was 496,600mt (2012: 537,100mt), 8% lower compared to 2012, due to 
competition from other millers despite the Group increasing its purchase price of external crops. The unfavourable 
weather also contributed to a lower crop production in the vicinity of the mills. The Group's mills processed 5% less 
FFB, but increased CPO production to 262,600mt (2012: 260,500mt) due to higher oil extraction rate from a better 
quality crop. 
 
The Group operating profit for 2013, before biological asset (BA ) adjustment was $59.6 million, 30% down on   
$85.4 million achieved in 2012. Earnings per share, before BA adjustment decreased to 90.70cts, compared to 
133.99cts in 2012 and post BA adjusted earnings per share were 235.95cts compared to 119.41cts for the previous 
year. The higher biological asset adjustment was due to an increase in the 10 year average CPO price and a 
reduction in discount rate applied. With the weakening of Rupiah, a foreign exchange loss of $2.8 million in 2013 
(2012: nil) also contributed to a lower profitability. 
 
As at 31 December 2013, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of $98.7 million and borrowings of $35.0 million, 
resulting in a net cash position of $63.7 million, compared to $91.2 million at 31 December 2012.  
 
In spite of the challenging market conditions the Board has continued to invest in the development of new assets. 
The Group planted 2,522ha of oil palms in 2013 of which 400ha comprised of replanting. This was less than planned, 
due primarily to delays in finalising agreement with villagers for land compensation payments in Bengkulu and 
Bangka and in securing the necessary land release permits in Kalimantan. The Indonesian government issued a 
decree effective on 2 October 2013 restricting plantation permits for oil palm planting to 100,000ha for plantation 
companies that are not state owned, cooperatives or majority publicly owned companies. According to the 
Indonesian Palm Oil Association, the decree would curtail the expansion and growth of plantation companies in 
Indonesia. However, based on the lawyers' opinions, it would appear that the decree would not apply to the Group 
as the Group's ownership of its land bank precedes the issuing of the decree. 
 
Despite the heavy rainfall also disrupting the earthworks for construction of the mill in Central Kalimantan in second 
quarter of 2013, the earthworks are now almost completed and the construction of mill buildings is in progress. This 
mill with an initial capacity of 45mt/hr is expected to be operational in second quarter of 2015. As previously reported 
the construction of another mill in North Sumatera is deferred while the Board considers further the relative cost 
advantages of two selected sites.   Chairman's Statement

AEP embraces the Group's responsibility for the impact of its activities on the environment, consumers, employees, 
communities, stakeholders and all other members of wider society. In meeting the Group's Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR ) obligations it is cognisant of the contribution and welfare of its employees while continuing to 
contribute to improve the well-being of the community.  
 
The $5 million biogas and biomass project for one of the mills in North Sumatera is nearing completion with the 
installation of equipment and commissioning expected in the second quarter of 2014. Redesign of some equipment 
as well as inclement weather delayed the external works and implementation. When the plant is fully operational, it 
will result in a significant reduction in the greenhouse gas emissions which are presently discharged from the effluent 
treatment in the anaerobic lagoons. The biogas reactor tank and covered lagoons will trap the biogas which will be 
used to generate power in place of fossil fuel. The biomass plant will utilize this power to process the empty fruit 
bunches into dried long fibres for export. The successful implementation and running of this project will pave the way 
for further similar undertaking in the Group's other palm oil mills. Although the biogas and biomas project is not a 
requirement of ISPO, it is nevertheless environmental friendly and is expected to have a return on investment of 
about six years. 
 
The Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO ) certification of the Group estates and mills will continue in 2014. In 
2013 the Group completed and submitted the certification audit of 3 plantations to the ISPO Committee. At the time 
of reporting, ISPO Committee has approved the certification of the 3 plantations. 
 
The majority of our employees working at the Group's plantations and mills, together with their families and 
dependents, are housed in self-contained communities constructed by the Group. Employees and their dependents 
are provided with free housing, clean water and electricity. Within these communities we also build and maintain 
places of worship, schools and sports facilities. In 2013, the Group spent $212,000 to build additional facilities and 
maintain these amenities and will continue to incur community development expenditure in 2014. 
 
The Group also recognises its obligations to the wider farming communities in which it operates. The Indonesian 
authorities have established that not less than 20% of the new planted areas acquired from 2007 onwards are to be 
reserved for the benefit of smallholder cooperatives, known as Plasma Scheme and the Group is integrating such 
smallholder developments alongside its estates. In order to aid the development of Plasma Scheme, a subsidiary 
provided a corporate guarantee during the year to a local bank in excess of $18 million to cover loans raised by 
cooperatives.  
 
The Board supported Kebun Kas Desa (village's scheme) development programme to supplement the livelihood of 
the villages. The Group provides technical and management expertise to villagers and has to-date financed, 
developed and managed 22 smallholder village schemes across four companies. 
 
The Board is mindful that given the anticipated further capital commitments the level of dividend needs to be 
balanced against the planned expenditure. The Board is also mindful of shareholders' sentiment and therefore 
declared a final dividend of 3.0p per share in respect of the year to 31 December 2013 (2012: 4.5cts) 
notwithstanding the Group achieved a lower profitability. Subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting, the final dividend will be paid on 17 June 2014 to those shareholders on the register on 16 May 2014.  
 
The Board views the prospects for 2014 with cautious optimism. As the continuing rise in income levels and 
population growth in China, India and Indonesia would be expected to drive the consumption of CPO and likely lead 
to a gradual recovery in CPO prices. The price differential between CPO and soya oil which has narrowed from a 
near four-year high of over $300/mt to just over $67/mt would nevertheless remain a concern as a smaller spread 
could prompt CPO buyers to switch to rival soya oil. However, as reported, the Indonesian government efforts to rein 
in fiscal deficits by introducing mandatory blending of biodiesel up to 10% effective from 1 January 2014 for industrial 
and commercial purposes may provide some price support.

Rising fertiliser consumption and increasing wage inflation in Indonesia are expected to increase the overall 
production cost in 2014. 
 
The Board nevertheless hopes that, against a backdrop of a global economic recovery, trading prospects will 
improve in 2014. 
 
The year saw the resignation of a Board member Drs. Kanaka Puradiredja. The Board thanked him and wish him the 
best. Mr. Jonathan Law Ngee Song, a lawyer by profession was appointed to the Board on 4 July 2013.   
 
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to convey our sincere thanks to our management and all employees 
of the Group for their dedication, loyalty, resourcefulness, commitment and contribution to the success of the Group. 
 
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank shareholders, business associates, government authorities and all 
other stakeholders for their continued confidence, understanding and support for the Group.
