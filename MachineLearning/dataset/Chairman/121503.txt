 Macfarlane Group's 2002 results reflect the ongoing transition within 
our distribution business, which will conclude in 2003. Recently issued
economic statistics, identifying lower levels of activity in the
manufacturing sector in the first two months of this year, are confirmed 
by our activity levels. The difficult market conditions, referred to in my
previous statements, continue with no indication of improvements in 
the short-term. Management effort continues to focus on the transition
programme to change fundamentally the shape and scope of our
business, enabling the Group to provide best in class service to all our
customers whilst at the same time seeking reductions in overheads to
right-size our cost structure to match prevailing levels of activity. The
majority of this programme is now completed and the teams in our 
new locations are now ready and eager to deliver the expected benefits.
Your Board remains fully committed to the strategic direction, which will
see the replacement of over 45 trading branches and manufacturing sites
with the creation of a national network of 15, state-of-the-art, regional
distribution centres coupled with two manufacturing centres of
excellence, providing a solid platform to take advantage of future growth
opportunities. Although we made the expected progress towards our
objectives in the second half of the year, with 11 of the 15 locations now
fully operational and our new management information system in place
at all UK locations, the transition has taken longer to achieve and caused
greater costs and disruption in the business than originally envisaged,
with a consequent impact on results. Consolidation at four remaining
locations, originally scheduled in 2002, will now take place in 2003. The
considerable dislocation of the business, which is inevitable during a
programme of such magnitude, is now starting to recede enabling our
staff to focus on increasing market share. As announced last October,
the Chief Executive will continue to focus on the recovery in the
Distribution business. The Board has now initiated a process to recruit a
Chief Operating Officer with wide business experience, who should have
the potential to become Chief Executive. 
The teams in our new
locations are now ready
and eager to deliver the

2MACFARLANE GROUP PLC REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2002
As I have stated previously, this is a bold and challenging realignment 
of our business, particularly in the current economic climate. The
programme will complete this year with further disposals of surplus
properties continuing to deliver cash and earnings to support the costs 
of the transition. As reported in previous statements, although the
benefits are taking longer to achieve than originally envisaged, your
Board remains confident that Macfarlane Group can secure a strong
market position, particularly once the trading cycle starts to show signs 
of improvement. We are not relying on the economy to make any
recovery in 2003 and consequently we are cautious in terms of the
immediate trading outlook, nevertheless your Board expects to make
further progress streamlining the business in the current year.

The loss before tax for the year to 31 December 2002 was  5.7m,
compared to  1.4m in 2001. The loss per share, as restated for the effects
of applying FRS 19 Deferred Tax , totalled 3.25p compared with 3.63p in
the previous year. Turnover reduced to  149.6m in 2002 from  198.2m
in 2001, reflecting the business disposals in 2001 and challenging market
conditions with lower levels of activity apparent particularly from
electronics and manufacturing customers.
PROPERTY DISPOSALS
Your Board has consistently articulated that part of its strategy of reshaping
the business is to fund the transition through the earnings and cash
generated from property disposals. This is reflected in our 2001 and 2002
results and even as we near the end of the programme, will continue into
2003 and 2004 with anticipated net proceeds from disposals in these two
years in excess of  12.0m. 
CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT DIVIDEND
The directors recommend payment of a final dividend of 3.20p to be
paid on 29 May 2003 to shareholders on the register at 25 April 2003,
which together with the interim dividend of 1.80p per share paid on 
10 October 2002 makes a total of 5.00p for the year (2001 - 5.00p).
Whilst your Board remains cautious of immediate trading prospects as
market conditions continue to be challenging, we are well aware of the
importance of dividends to shareholders and would intend to use funds
from property disposals to support existing levels of dividend. However
the level of dividend payments will, as always, require to be considered
as prospective trading performance becomes clearer, allowing the Board
to assess the immediate and longer-term ability to underpin dividend
payments.
FINANCE
Shareholders approved two special resolutions on 9 May 2001 and 
14 May 2002 giving the Company authority to buy back shares in the
Company. During 2002, the Company bought back 4,256,000 ordinary
shares, representing 3.57% of the Company's called up share capital for
a total consideration of  2,608,000 for cancellation. The purchases
took place at a number of dates between 14 January 2002 and 
13 November 2002. The prices paid for the shares ranged from 38
1
/2p
per share to 87p per share. It is the Directors' intention to seek
shareholder approval to renew this authority at the AGM on 13 May
2003 to continue to have the flexibility to buy back shares should this 
be appropriate.
Cash outflow from operating activities was  0.3m (2001 cash inflow -
 17.7 million) and the Group's financing requirements have been met 
by short-term borrowings. Following acquisitions and capital expenditure
totalling  14.4m during the year and share buy-backs costing  2.6m the
Group had net debt of  14.0m at 31 December 2002, compared to net
funds of  2.7m the previous year. There was a net interest charge of
 0.4 million, the same as in 2001. Macfarlane Group still faces modest
investments to establish an appropriate base for future growth but our
executive remains confident that, by a continued realignment of the asset
base, the necessary investments can be funded in a cash neutral manner.
The transitional arrangements of Financial Reporting Standard 17 
on retirement benefits have again been adopted, requiring certain
disclosures at 31 December 2002 of the net pension scheme asset or
deficit. Our UK defined benefits pension scheme has a deficit net of tax
of  11.6m (2001 deficit  4.8m). The ongoing funding of the pension
scheme is determined by a full actuarial valuation performed by the
Group's independent actuary. As a result of the valuation carried out 
on 1 May 2002, the final salary scheme was closed to new entrants and
the employer contribution rate increased from 13.5% to 15.5% of
pensionable salary, and the employee contribution rate increased from
5.0% to 7.0% of pensionable salary with effect from 1 July 2002. This
contribution level is expected to reverse the deficit over the estimated
remaining service lives of the employees.

MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES
Delivering the benefits from such a fundamental transition programme 
in our business is no easy task. We have a number of good management
teams with a wealth of experience in packaging as well as some exciting
new talent. All our management teams and employees deserve our
continuing gratitude for their commitment in addressing the challenges
readily evident in today's business environment as well as taking the hard
decisions necessary to obtain the benefits from the restructuring
programme.
FUTURE PROSPECTS
Macfarlane Group's strategy is to be a leading packaging distributor and
value added service provider. Investments in manufacturing will be made
where it can provide robust and sustainable earnings while providing
critical manufacturing skills to augment both the benefits of scale now
within the Group and the extensive choice of products available to our
50,000 customers. 
Our property divestment programme continues and is expected to
generate additional profits and cash in 2003 to offset the costs of
transition. Major progress has been made in recent months to exit vacant
premises and this will have a major impact in our efforts to reduce our
cost base. Although the expected benefits in our Distribution business are
taking longer to achieve and causing greater disruption than originally
envisaged, there are encouraging signs that where the transition has been
completed, our people are ready to deliver the benefits of the strategy.
Your Board believes that our distribution business will benefit in 2003
from the actions being taken to streamline the business. 
Market activity, particularly in recent months, remains at lower than
expected levels. Whilst trading conditions remain challenging and 
the prospects of economic growth in 2003 are limited, much of our
recent activity has been of necessity inward focused given the need 
to concentrate our activities on our people, new premises and the
introduction of the new information systems. As the greater part of this
activity is now behind us, our teams have a real appetite and a clear
opportunity to focus on increasing our market share.
The Board believes that the strategic direction of the Group is sound and
the continuing steps being taken to streamline the business will strengthen
trading prospects by reducing the Company's cost base. The Board's
objective is to ensure that a robust business is created, which can not only
withstand market uncertainty, but also gain market share by providing the
highest levels of service to our customers.
