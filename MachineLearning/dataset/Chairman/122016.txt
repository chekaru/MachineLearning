product to Maelor s future growth potential.
Corporate activity
While Maelor continues to grow organically, your Board has
recognised the importance of expanding our current portfolio
through the acquisition of products or businesses that are
complementary to our strategy. This process started in earnest
about a year ago, and has already resulted in the acquisition of two
new products, at least one of which, Maelor Oral Syringes, should
be making a contribution to our bottom line in the current financial
year. Whilst we have also had merger discussions with several
companies, we have only considered those opportunities which we
consider would accelerate our drive to profitability and allow us to
retain control of Maelor as an innovative healthcare company.
During the year, we received an unsolicited approach to acquire the
Company. We gave proper consideration to it but were unable
to negotiate a suitable basis for making any recommendation
to shareholders and the approach was subsequently withdrawn.
Outlook
Your Board believes that, with costs under tight control, our current
portfolio of products is capable of delivering profitability.
The Company is now on a sound footing and with an enlarged
portfolio of income-producing products we are managing the risks
associated with the life sciences sector. Our portfolio is to be
Chairman s statement
During the past financial year, Maelor's management has continued
to work hard to put the Company onto a stronger footing. In the
two years since the appointment of Stephen Appelbee as Chief
Executive, turnover has more than doubled, and losses have
almost halved.
We have made substantial progress with our product portfolio.
Our lead product, the catheter maintenance range, OptiFlo , has
increased its community prescription market share in the UK from
26% to 42% in that two-year period. We have also launched two
other brands, Volplex , our blood plasma substitute product and
ContiSol , our own catheter maintenance brand, and Maelor s
products are now available in five countries.
Turnover has increased, costs are under tight control, and we
believe that we have sufficient working capital to see us through
to profitability.
Financial summary
Maelor s turnover of  1,340,005 (2003:  1,169,744) represents
a 15% increase over last year, driven primarily by greater sales
of Volplex in the second half of the year.
The Group's loss for the year at  1,118,016 (2003:  2,076,930) was
a lower figure than we budgeted and represents a 46% reduction
from the previous year. Group cash balances at 31 March 2004
were  1,913,748 (2003:  3,294,656).
Turnover has increased, costs are under tight control, and we
believe that we have sufficient working capital to see us
through to profitability. 
Business summary
During the year, we have made substantial progress with our
broadening product portfolio. Sales of OptiFlo, distributed by Bard
Limited (Bard), continue to grow, and the product remains the
major contributor to turnover.
We also launched ContiSol, our own brand of urethral catheter
cleansing solutions, in Greece and Spain. Further launches in Europe
and other parts of the world are expected in the next 12 months.
Growth in Volplex 500ml sales in the UK has been most
encouraging. With the market being dominated by NHS contracts,
our distributor, Cambridge Laboratories, has won over half of the
business tendered since the launch of Volplex. This success has
encouraged us to invest in the Volplex 1 litre presentation, whose
recent approval should result in improved profit margins later
in 2004.
The approval of the TendaGel  Marketing Authorisation
Application in the UK was announced in November 2003.
We continue to conduct an extensive commercial review of this
product's potential with our UK distributor, Bard, in the light of
significant changes in the market since we began the original
development of this product.
Work on micelle propofol continues to provide us with compelling
data. That we have not so far attracted a partner to assist in the
commercial exploitation of this product is a major disappointment
to us. Our success in other areas, however, gives us the comfort
that we no longer need revenue from micelle propofol to achieve
supplemented in the current financial year by the launch of at least
one new product, which will support Maelor s future growth. 
We remain committed to the search for a partner for micelle
propofol and continue to seek out further commercial opportunities
that will assist in the drive to profitability.
