 Management Consulting Group PLC 
Annual report and accounts 2008 04
Overview
2008 was a challenging but ultimately very 
successful year for mCG. Record underlying 
results and strong cash generation were 
achieved despite the gathering economic 
recession and the need to carry out a painful 
restructuring of the Group. By the end of 
the year we had created a more balanced 
and broad based business that is far less 
reliant on any one industrial sector or 
geography for its success. 
The business is now structured as 
three resilient and client focused practices: 
Ineum Consulting, Kurt Salmon Associates 
and proudfoot. These continue to enjoy Group 
synergies while benefiting from independent 
management driving their growth. although our 
share price has fallen by 36% during 2008 this 
compares favourably with a significant number 
of other small cap companies. I hope that our 
share price during 2009 will reflect the broad 
base of our profit stream, the strong cash 
generation capability of our business and 
the benefits of the cost reduction exercise 
completed late in 2008.
Proudfoot and Ineum Consulting, in particular, 
performed very well in 2008. proudfoot recorded 
its highest revenue and profit figures since the 
early 1990s and Ineum Consulting continued 
its very successful growth, reaching almost 
double its revenue in 2006, the year of 
its acquisition. kurt salmon associates 
experienced more difficult trading towards 
the end of the year, particularly due to the 
slowdown in its core retail market. h owever 
it responded well by actively managing its cost 
base in advance of the downturn and is in 
good shape to face its future challenges.
2008 was a challenging but ultimately very 
successful year for MCG. Record underlying 
results and strong cash generation were achieved 
despite the gathering economic recession.

Annual report and accounts 2008 05
The Group generates well over 90% of its 
business outside the Uk and so the current 
weakness of Sterling is beneficial to its reported 
revenue and profits. Unless Sterling strengthens 
significantly against major currencies, this trend 
will continue during 2009.
The Group again generated cash strongly during 
2008, with excellent working capital management 
across the divisions. although the reported 
year end net debt figure is inflated by the 
weakness of Sterling and a cash outflow relating 
to over  10m of non recurring costs, at constant 
exchange rates debt decreased by  18.6m during 
the year . we remained comfortably within our debt 
facility and covenant limits throughout the year.
shareholder returns remain uppermost in our 
priorities and, having restructured the Group 
during 2008, we regularly review and consider 
all the strategic options open to us as we look 
to maximise these returns.
Summary of trading performance
mCG reached record levels of revenue and 
underlying profit in 2008. Total revenue for the 
year ended 31 december 2008 from continuing 
businesses was up 60.0% to  343.1m (2007: 
 214.5m). The Group benefited from full year 
trading of the two 2007 acquisitions and the 
strength of the Euro and the US Dollar , the Group's 
major trading currencies. Underlying profit from 
operations was up 33.3% to  34.7m (2007: 
 26.1m). The weakness of sterling compared to 
the euro and the Us dollar had a positive effect on 
the Group's results. If translated at 2007 exchange 
rates revenue would have been  34.4m lower and 
underlying profit from operations  2.7m lower.
Non recurring costs of  21.5m (2007:  2.5m) 
were incurred in respect of the many restructuring 
programmes undertaken during 2008. There was

a charge of  26.7m (2007: zero) relating to the 
impairment of the goodwill in respect of parson 
Consulting. Consequently there was an overall loss 
from operations of  15.9m (2007:  21.9m profit). 
The full year effect of the additional debt 
taken on during 2007 to finance acquisitions 
has increased interest expense, net of investment 
income to  4.2m (2007:  2.1m). The loss before 
tax was  20.0m ( 19.8m profit). 
Following an underlying effective tax rate of 
33% (2007: 31%), the underlying earnings per 
share from continuing operations were up 4.9% 
to 6.2p (2007: 5.9p). Basic earnings per share 
were -6.4p (2007: 4.7p). an interim dividend of 
0.40p per share (2007: 0.33p per share) was paid 
on 21 october 2008. The directors recommend 
a final dividend of 0.90p per share (2007: 0.82p 
per share) to be paid on 2 July 2009 to ordinary 
shareholders on the register at 5 June 2009.
Cash generation was strong throughout the 
year and net debt at year end was  62.1m 
(2007:  60.9m). The vast majority of the 
Group's debt is in euros and Us dollars and so 
was adversely affected by exchange movements 
during the year. At 2007 exchange rates, 
year end net debt would have been  42.3m.
Group structure and strategy
Ineum Consulting and kurt salmon associates are 
industry led consultancies offering strategic and 
business management consultancy services. 
proudfoot is an operational improvement business. 
T o maintain the appropriate focus on these three 
practices I have revamped the organisational 
structure of the Group so that each reports 
directly to me. as a consequence their results 
will be shown separately in this report. during 
2008 parson Consulting and viaduct Consulting 
were integrated into Ineum Consulting and their 
names discontinued. In december 2008 the Management Consulting Group PLC

Group structure and strategy continued
stake in salzer Consulting was sold back 
to the original owner.
In parallel to these organisational changes 
a strategic review was undertaken to develop 
a blueprint for the future direction of the 
Group. This too was completed just as the 
credit squeeze began to take hold and the 
global economy headed towards recession. 
Growth opportunities for the Group were 
identified during the process and the Group 
intends to invest cautiously in the resource 
required to exploit these as external economic 
conditions allow. Likewise many cost saving 
opportunities became evident and the Group 
has embraced these quickly and expediently 
in order to refocus the business to its three key 
brands and its appropriate geographical footprint.
Non client facing costs, particularly central costs, 
have been minimised during 2008. around a 
dozen properties have been withdrawn from 
during the year and a further five downsized. 
The Group has restructured its old parson 
Consulting and Viaduct Consulting businesses, 
integrating these into Ineum Consulting, sold 
its stake in salzer Consulting and downsized 
its operations in China to reduce substantially 
the losses in the region.
The strategy of mCG remains to maximise 
shareholder value through organic growth and 
selected small acquisitions whilst reducing the 
net debt of the business, with a view to becoming 
debt free before the expiry of the current 
committed banking facility in 2012.
People
On 19 February 2008, Rolf Stomberg, Chairman 
and Kevin Parry, Chief Executive, stood down 
from the Board. o n the same day I was 
appointed executive Chairman and continue 
to have overall executive responsibility for 
the Group. On 19 March 2008, Luiz Carvalho, 
miguel de Fontenay and mark wietecha joined the 
Board as Executive Directors. On 23 April 2008, 
mark w ietecha was appointed deputy Chairman 
and Luiz Carvalho and miguel de Fontenay 
appointed managing d irectors of mCG. 
On 19 February 2008, Craig Smith, Finance 
Director, announced his resignation but on 
23 april 2008 agreed to withdraw this and 
continue in that role. On 8 October 2008, 
Julian w aldron was appointed to the Board 
as Non executive Director. At the 2009 Annual 
General meeting mark wietecha will relinquish 
his position as deputy Chairman and become 
a managing director of mCG with executive 
responsibility for kurt salmon associates. The 
Board currently has five Non executive Directors 
and is seeking to appoint one more to reflect the 
geographical diversity of mCG. I would like to 
take this opportunity to thank all the d irectors 
who worked with MCG during 2008, and indeed 
all the employees, for their sterling efforts during 
this turbulent year in the Group's history.
Prospects
Life is as challenging for mCG as it is for many 
other businesses in today's economic climate. 
However, during 2008 we have created a 
balanced portfolio of practices and maintained a 
secure financial position and good cash generation 
while continuing to develop a team of highly 
professional partners and staff. Currently our 
order book and revenue are at a similar level 
to last year and we remain very focused on 
meeting the significant economic challenge 
of today's trading environment.
