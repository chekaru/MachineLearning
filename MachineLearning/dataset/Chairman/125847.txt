 Mears Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 04
REVIEW OF THE YEAR
CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
I am delighted to announce 
another year of strong growth 
in profitability and turnover, 
our eleventh consecutive year 
of record profits. The acquisition 
of Careforce Group plc is an 
expansion of our public sector 
services into the community 
domiciliary care provision 
market. Your Board believes that 
there is potential to develop the 
sophistication of the domiciliary 
care market which has parallels 
with the way in which Mears 
has driven the development of 
the social housing market during 
the last ten years.
Mears was listed on the 
Alternative Investment Market 
of the London Stock Exchange 
(AIM) in October 1996. We had 
83 employees and turnover 
of  12m. Since then we have 
achieved an average annual 
compound growth rate in 
profits of 40%. 
Throughout 2006 we have 
continued to build long-term 
partnership relationships with 
our customers and are delighted 
to welcome new customers and 
new employees into the Group. 
We are positioned for another stage 
of our development with a focused 
management team targeting two 
growing public sector markets. 
We've continued our strong growth 
this year. In line with current market 
expectations, turnover was up 18.6%, 
operating profit before share-based 
payments and amortisation was up 
26.8% and dividend is up 26.9% 
compared to the previous year. 
We now employ 2,500 people and 
we have an order book in excess of 
 1 billion. It's another very strong, 
very consistent set of results that 
are a credit to our employees.
Consistent qualities
We have been through enormous 
changes since being listed all those 
years ago but the same four 
qualities have remained:
  We are not afraid of hard work.
   We have an open and honest 
approach to partnership - 
with clients, with tenants, 
with suppliers and with advisers.
   We have strong financial 
management across the 
entire business.
   We know how to work 
together effectively.
We have experienced increased 
competition and despite that we 
have kept our order book above 
the  1 billion level which reflects 
well upon our development team 
and their insistence upon only 
bidding on those contracts where 
our partnership ethos will be valued. 
We will not compete solely on a 
price model in our chosen markets. 
I believe it is the quality of those 
orders that is most significant. 
These are long-term relationships 
with clients based on the right key 
performance indicators. We have 
never taken on short-term contracts 
simply to create more flattering 
figures. We are building a robust 
business, a business based on real 
partnerships, aimed at creating 
value for money and improving 
the lives of tenants.
People: our primary asset
We have continued to recruit from 
the strong talent available nationally 
whilst retaining the large majority 
of our senior team. One of the true 
measures, in my opinion, of being 
an employer of choice is that the 
majority of the senior team at 
Mears has been with the Group 
for a period of in excess of six years. 
Our retention of key employees has 
been successful and we adopt the 
same partnership approach to 
our employees. A recent employee 
survey indicated that the Group is 
still very much a fun place to work.
At the end of January 2007 we 
announced the resignation of 
Stuart Black. I took on the role of 
Chief Executive Officer in addition to 
my existing role as Executive Chairman 
of the Group and have reduced my 
outside commitments in order to 
devote more time to the Group. 
At the same time we appointed 
David Miles to the Group Board as 
Managing Director of Mears Social 
Housing to bring added depth and 
insight at the operational level.
I do believe that the strong 
management teams we have built 
throughout Mears will demonstrate 
our resilience to these changes at 
Group level and I am personally 
committed to providing those teams 
with all the resources they require 
to ensure they take the Group to 
the next stage of growth.
Improving communities 
is part of our DNA
Our community affairs programme, 
as part of our corporate social 
responsibility remit, is not just a 
set of policies here - it is at the 
heart of this Group. I believe our 
work should help to improve daily 
life for people. I say our job is to 
make tenants smile. Our proposed 
acquisition of Careforce Group plc 
brings us ever closer to the community 
and delivers on our strategy to become 
the leading provider of outsourced 
services in the community.
Many of our employees come 
from the communities they 
serve and through apprenticeship 
schemes we are helping to increase 
employment and opportunity in 
deprived areas. We are planning 
to make our workforce even more 
reflective of our communities.
Our community work has a real 
effect on people's lives. Throughout 
the year we have been involved in 
over 220 community based initiatives 
which provided a real and tangible 
benefit to those communities. 
Our community affairs team voted, 
as our outstanding initiative, our 
work at the Russell Gardens sheltered 
housing development in Stockport. 
A fantastic demonstration of a local 
community working with us to create 
a better life . Simon Howard from 
our Broadstairs office was voted 
Mears Customer Services Champion 
for services provided above and 
beyond our measure of service. 
He was awarded his prize at our 
annual conference in January 2007, 
I commend him to you.
A strong position 
in great markets
I see excellent prospects in social 
housing. We continue to see a trend 
for larger, longer-term contracts and 
that plays to our strengths as a leader 
in that market.

REVIEW OF THE YEAR
We can still maximise our 
advantages in terms of quality 
of service, scale, innovation 
and our proven commitment 
to working in partnership.
I see no signs that change in the 
political climate will affect the social 
housing market significantly. The 
Decent Homes initiative was scheduled 
to end in 2010 - though we expect 
that to stretch to 2015. We are a 
leader in the strong repairs and 
maintenance market and see little 
difficulty in continuing to build our 
business as Decent Homes comes 
to an end to be replaced by capital 
works programmes.
The UK care market, of which 
domiciliary care represents a significant 
part, has grown strongly as a result of 
an increased trend for outsourcing to 
private sector providers.
The demographics of the UK 
show that those aged 85 plus are 
in the fastest growing age group. 
Government commitments that care 
should, where possible, be carried 
out in the home suggest that care 
provides a further opportunity for 
long-term growth.
Looking ahead
I would like to thank everyone 
at Mears for their commitment 
and hard work in 2006. My firm 
expectation for 2007 is that the 
excellent team here will raise their 
game once again. I want everyone 
within this Group to get the most 
from the career opportunities they 
have and to be ambitious for 
themselves and the business. 
There are enormous opportunities 
ahead for both our existing business 
and for the sector we are moving 
into through the proposed acquisition 
of Careforce Group plc. I remain 
absolutely committed to this Group 
and I am confident that these 
combined factors will take the Group 
to new levels in 2007 and beyond.
