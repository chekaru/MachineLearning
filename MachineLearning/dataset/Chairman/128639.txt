 The targeted level of Profits for 2003 was 
 16m and was set at the beginning of 
2003 by reference to market expectations 
and internal forecasts at that time. The 
Committee retains the discretion to review 
this arrangement and set different rates and 
thresholds as it deems appropriate for the 
business.
The target for 2004 has been set and will be 
disclosed in next year's report. The threshold 
in 2004 for awarding the additional 2% of 
profits has been increased to 1.25 from 
1.2 times the targeted level.
In the event that this mechanism creates an 
annual bonus greater than 100% of salary for 
any executive, only an amount equal to the 
executive's salary will be paid in cash. The 
excess above the individual's salary level will 
be paid into an employee benefit trust and 
invested in the Company's shares with no 
matching investment by the Company. These 
shares will be reserved for the executive and 
will vest in equal tranches 1, 2 and 3 years 
later, normally so long as the executive is still 
in employment at that time.
The bonus pool will be capable of variation 
by the Committee both up and down by, 
initially, 10%, to reflect the Committee's view 
on the performance of the Company relative 
to its directly comparable peers. There has 
been no variation made to the 2003 bonus 
pool.
Incentive Share Plan for Executive 
Directors and Senior Employees
In December 2003, shareholders approved 
a new Incentive Share Plan for Executive 
Directors and senior employees. Initially, 
5% of Group Profits of the preceeding year 
will be paid into an employee benefit trust 
and invested in the Company's shares. Not 
more than 60% of this figure will be available 
for awards to the Executive Directors. 
The balance will be for awards to senior 
employees. Group Profits are defined as 
group profit before taxation and before 
exceptional and extraordinary items and 
charges or credits resulting from the Plan 
or other share option grants, as described 
below.
Two thirds of these shares (Deferred Share 
Awards ) are subject to a three year deferral 
period during which they will be forfeited 
if the relevant director or senior employee 
leaves, other than in compassionate 
circumstances . The remaining third 
(Performance Share Awards ) are also to 
be deferred for three years but are subject 
to earnings per share (EPS ) growth targets 
over the three year period. Awards up to 
50% of a director's or senior employee's 
salary will only vest if EPS grows by an 
average of 5% over the growth in UK RPI 
per annum over the three year period. Any 
excess between 50% and 75% of salary will 
only vest to the extent that EPS grows by 
7.5% over the growth in UK RPI per annum 
over the three year period. Finally, to the 
extent that the performance share award is 
greater than 75% of an executive's salary, 
the hurdle will be 10% over the growth in UK 
RPI per annum over the three year period. 
If awards do not vest after three years, then 
they will lapse.
Senior executives of the Group who benefit 
from these arrangements will, in the future, 
receive only modest share option grants as 
described below. 
The Committee retains the discretion to 
review the proportion of profits dedicated 
to the Incentive Share Plan in the light of 
the growth in the size of the Company, its 
profitability and the number of Executive 
Directors.
Based on the 2003 results, awards totalling 
 1.175m will be made in 2004 of which 
 0.675m (57.4%) is for the Executive 
Directors.
Restricted Share Scheme
On flotation in 2001, 6% of the issued 
shares of the Group owned by Spherion 
Corporation, the Group's previous ultimate 
parent company, were allocated to the 
Executive Directors and certain senior 
executives in a Restricted Share Scheme. 
Benefits received under the Restricted Share 
Scheme are not pensionable and the shares 
will be delivered in 2004.
Executive Share Option Scheme
The Executive Directors and senior 
employees are eligible to participate in 
the Executive Share Option Scheme. 
No payment is required on the grant of an 
option and no share options are granted 
at a discount. Benefits received under 
the Executive Share Option Scheme will 
not be pensionable. Share options can 
only be exercised on the achievement of 
performance criteria which are disclosed in 
note 18 of the Financial Statements.  For 
future share option awards retesting after 
the initial vesting period will not be permitted.
