 Dear reader
 
I think our teams should be warmly congratulated for delivering a stellar performance in 2011 against a 
very uncertain Market and financial back drop. By hitting their financial targets they have ensured that we 
continue to stabilise the business by reducing our inherited debt and providing a platform from which 
future growth can be encouraged.
Our three lead Agencies built on the gains they had made in 2010 whilst our smaller, yet perfectly formed 
Agencies either maintained or grew, albeit from a smaller base. For example, critical wins at RLA have 
established them as the leading player in the UK aftermarket automotive sector. Our focus on specialisation 
has been even more highlighted by ThinkBDW, who are now the UK's clear leader in the property marketing 
sector and April-Six, who are fast becoming recognised as the B2B technology Agency of choice.
Significant Client wins throughout the year have bolstered overall performance but greatest credit to the 
teams must go against their record of Client retention which, in a world of increased competition, shrinking 
margins and uncertain budgeting, is no mean feat.
2011 also saw us increase our portfolio through strategic and service complementing in-fill acquisitions. 
Either geographically, through Robson Brown in Newcastle, or by offering, through the social media 
experts Yucca or our new colleagues from Fire IMS who have joined our flourishing Belfast Agency, RLA. In 
November 2011 we established Bray Leino Vivactis, a business focused on the serious end of the Healthcare 
sector. This new team was created via a firm co-operation with the mainland European Healthcare Group, 
Vivactis, and by the hiring of top notch talent from leading Healthcare Agencies. We are very excited by 
this venture and we have every confidence that it will create a new and refreshing option within this sector. 
Early successes indicate that we will achieve our goal.
Looking into 2012 we are aiming for more of the same. Our focus will continue to be to pay down debt, 
consolidate our Agencies, act more as one business where it is appropriate for our Clients who require that 
depth of support, and to create new offerings wherever we see a strategic need or a business-enhancing 
opportunity.
I believe that we have the people, the structure and the passion in place to take further our commitment 
to being the most respected and regarded Agency group in the UK and that our forward momentum will 
continue through 2012. 
We have had a sound start to the year and I feel confident that through controlled growth we will have 
a decent year ahead of us and will go into 2013 in even better shape as a business. It's safe to say, therefore, 
that we are predicting an exciting year for the mission

Chairman's Statement The Mission Marketing Group plc Annual Report 7
together, we are
One of the UK's leading technology Agencies.
April-Six is the resident business-to-business technology 
specialist and we're proud to serve some of the world's 
biggest technology brands. What makes us really stand 
out is our passionate, can-do attitude and impeccable 
Client service ethos, which makes light work of managing 
the demands of complex subject matter, rapidly evolving 
markets and global teams across geographies, languages, 
cultures and time zones.
The promise: refreshingly different technology marketing.
With specialists in advertising, sales activation, digital and 
PR, at Big we create big ideas for ambitious brands, using 
real insight to truly engage. 
Recent work has included the It's what we do  campaign 
for Domino's Pizza which rolled out across TV, press and 
online banners. We also created an  industry first' product 
efficiency calculator app for JCB which highlights the 
fuel efficiency and bottom line savings achieved when 
using a JCB machine. 
Our other Clients include Holland & Barrett, WKD, 
Blockbuster and Samsung Mobile.

Wise-up to roll-ups
Our aim was to encourage the estimated 300,000 roll-
up smokers in the South West of England to wise-up 
to hand rolling tobacco. And to help them realise that 
it's just as bad as smoking ordinary cigarettes. The fact 
that Smokefree South West ran out of  Quit Kit Wise-Up 
Pouches' twice during the campaign suggests we made 
quite an impact.
Help tomorrow take shape
It was one of the biggest marketing challenges of the 
decade. The brief for the 2011 Census campaign was to 
reach every one of the 26 million households in England 
and Wales, and to encourage them all to fill in their census 
forms. With a 94% national response rate, outperforming 
the previous census campaign held ten years ago, we 
believe we succeeded.
Kia
Our longstanding relationship with Kia Motors in the 
British Isles keeps going from strength to strength. Last 
year saw the launch of the new Picanto supermini and for 
the product rollout we produced some really stunning 
work - direct mail, point-of-sale, press advertising, mini-
brochures, showroom vehicle graphics and customer 
loyalty packs.
Scania
Dirt roads. Rocky roads. No roads. The new Scania Off-
road trucks are built with one simple focus: to reliably 
move their customers and their customer's business 
ahead. In all conditions.
The one-piece solid steel bumper, the new high chassis 
with air suspension and the Scania Opticruse with a new 
Off-road mode. The trucks are full of new features that 
enhance the driving experience and make the trucks 
more robust than ever. The Scania Off-road trucks are 
the toughest construction trucks they have ever built. 
And to prove it - a photoshoot in a quarry in deepest 
Hirwaun, Aberdare to put the trucks to the test. Watch out 
for the video - coming soon on scania.co.uk.

We invest in imagination, inventiveness and creativity. 
We deliver ideas that get results for our clients... ideas 
that work.
This year we have delivered rebranding for the national 
education award organisation NCFE. We have helped 
reduce smoking rates through a unique Every breath  
campaign for Fresh Smokefree North East with the 
backing of Sting. Sam's Snaps campaign was launched 
online for Balance to help protect children from the 
effects of alcohol. We've ensured DFDS Seaways has 
remained top of passengers' minds in a turbulent 
market, and developed a unique Sealy Beds sleep app 
along the way too.
HSBC
Our campaign for HSBC's expansion across Scotland 
leveraged their USP of  Global expertise delivered locally'. 
The campaign was delivered locally through 48 sheets 
and delivered five times the volume of customers in the 
first 3 months compared with other branch openings.
Highland Spring
Our recent work for Highland Spring sees us take the 
Brand back onto television after a 5 year absence. The 
campaign, The Joys of Highland Spring , focuses on 
the fact that the water is drawn from organic land and 
nothing but mother nature touches it  from source to 
bottle - TV, outdoor and sponsorship. The Mission Marketing Group plc Annual Report 10

Marketing suite
When you're a housebuilder trying to sell new homes, 
making the right first impression really matters. From 
concept to completion, we designed and manufactured 
the  Pulse' Marketing Suite for Fairview New Homes.
Information on Kew Bridge West
We established the identity and branding for this St James 
development close to Kew Bridge, positioning it as a 
prestigious development within easy reach of London's 
West End, the River and extensive parkland.
Designed to appeal to Far Eastern investors the marketing 
resulted in a highly successful sales tour of Hong Kong, 
Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.
