Dear shareholder
It's now three years since we restructured  and I am pleased to report that 2012 saw a continuation 
of our progress in what has been yet another challenging year for our sector.
Our objective going into 2012 was to maintain our progress whilst strengthening the expertise of our 
Agencies and the Group. We focused on concinnity and our Agencies have never worked better together, 
providing a cohesion that we and our Clients have benefited from.
Overall the Agencies have performed very well. They have improved their status with their Clients and 
created great new business wins from the likes of Aviva, Brittany Ferries and M&S Bank. What is even more 
admirable is that they have retained and built their existing Client bases at a time when competitive activity 
has never been fiercer. Our progress has come both from our consumer and B2B Agencies as well as our 
specialist IT, Property and Automotive businesses. They should be justly proud of their achievements in 2012.
We have also sought to strengthen our Group by bringing in new expertise that complements the whole. 
Both newcomers are already providing new and dynamic options to the rest of the Group thereby enhancing 
our Client offer.
The Addiction team joined us in September, principally to spearhead our capabilities in Branded Content  
and to fulfil our desire to create Mission Studios that will provide our Agencies with pre and post film 
production services from its West One base. Their work for the likes of B&Q and Remington is highly 
regarded and opens up new channels of opportunity for us.
We acquired balloon dog in Norwich and London in October to strengthen our CRM and data offering and 
provide us with yet another outstanding and profitable Agency that works with Clients such as Barclays, 
Pret a Manger and Aviva. The scope to build on the balloon dog business certainly exists within the Group.
But best of all, both of these new additions have brought us some great new colleagues, all of whom chose 
to be with  because they believe in what we are doing.
So where do we go from here? Our Agencies are in good shape and we expect them to work even closer 
together going forward. Their Client bases are the envy of the industry and they all have exciting strategies 
for the future. 
2012 was a tough old year but we did what we said we would do. So I guess we did well and it's fair to say 
we are seeing some positive signs. Green shoots maybe but who knows what this mad economic world 
has in store for us? That is why we will continue to build cautiously and maintain a reduced risk position.  
We remain acquisitive but in a measured manner, call us quakebuttocks if you will, but our focus will remain 
on debt management, expertise enhancement and concinnity.
We remain excited by the potential of our business and look forward to further progress in 2013 and beyond.

Back of the net!
Football and pizza go together like...well, 
football and pizza. So when Domino's 
needed an app that would allow fans to 
interact with a summer of soccer, and 
the chance to win prizes even after the 
home teams were eliminated, Domigoals 
was the perfect answer. With thousands 
of downloads, a raft of new-to-brand 
customers, nearly 30,000 online 
transactions and awards and nominations 
galore, including BIMA, GRAMIA and  
Fresh, Domigoals is a premier league 
piece of work.
Barclaycard small business strategy.
Around 95% of Barclaycard small business 
customers are signed up in a Barclays 
bank branch. This can lead to low levels 
of activation and usage. We reviewed the 
entire sales process; channels, materials 
and touch-points, allowing us to identify 
the gaps and opportunities in order to 
drive spend. Our refined strategy is now 
used to support all small business briefs 
with several initiatives created as a direct 
result - including an interactive in-branch 
awareness campaign. The Mission Marketing Group plc Annual Report 2012 10

Forget Fernados, take me  
out in the new Picanto!
Kia launched the new Picanto City 
wanting to introduce it to new sassy and 
design-conscious customers. Partnering 
with the highly-rated Saturday night show 
was a natural fit. We needed to bring the 
TV action into UK dealerships with POS, 
ambient and promotions - where you 
could end up on the Take Me Out Love 
Island. We reached 60% of the audience 
with many  liking' it online and 90%+ uptake 
in dealership.
We're still together.
Curiosity. It can lead  
a brand anywhere. 
Brittany Ferries offer a travel experience 
that provides limitless possibilities. Our 
stirring campaign, based around the 
concept of curiosity, took them from 
a place of rational, product focused 
comms, to a more emotionally engaging 
and thought provoking proposition. The 
project has energised the brand, it's made 
new audiences excited about Brittany 
Ferries and as an Agency, it's a piece of 
work we're immensely proud to stand by.

Full of the joys of Highland Spring.
Highland Spring's business objective was 
to be No.1 in the UK's highly competitive 
and increasingly challenging bottled water 
market. In March 2012, we launched 
the  Full of the Joys of Highland Spring' 
positioning. A fully integrated campaign 
featuring a feel-good, mischievous mole 
was developed based on the brand truth 
that drinking Highland Spring leaves you 
feeling healthy and hydrated. Highland 
Spring are well on their way to becoming 
the UK's No.1 bottled water brand. Joy!
What price are we really paying  
for cheap alcohol?
Our Client Balance aims to inspire change 
to the way North East residents think 
about and drink alcohol. Our campaign 
raised awareness of the issues around 
young people and alcohol, ultimately 
encouraging sign up to a minimum unit 
price consultation. Outdoor, leafleting, 
on-street engagement and digital all 
combined to drive traffic to an online 
film and microsite. To date nearly 15,000 
signed postcards have been presented 
to government. The Mission Marketing Group plc Annual Report 2012 12
