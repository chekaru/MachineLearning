Directors' report: business review
Robust performance in line with
expectations
We delivered a robust performance for 2009,
despite experiencing some challenging trading
conditions across our chosen sectors. The 13%
decrease in revenue to  2,214m (2008:  2,548m)
and the 28% decrease in profit before tax and
amortisation to  51.5m (2008:  71.4m) were
principally due to a decline in higher margin
activities in the Fit Out and Affordable Housing
divisions, although this was partly offset by record
results from our Construction and Infrastructure
Services divisions. 
Earnings per share before amortisation of intangible
assets fell by 27% to 93.9p (2008: 1 27.8p). Profit
before tax (after amortisation of intangible assets)
fell by 28% to  44.7m (2008:  62.3m). We have
declared a second interim dividend of 30.0p
payable on 1 April 2010. This is in place of the final
dividend, which for 2008 was 30.0p and was paid
on 8 May 2009. This gives a total dividend for the
year of 42.0p (2008: 42.0p). 
Our year end cash balance was  1 18m (2008:
 1 20m) and we achieved, as expected, an average
cash balance throughout the year of  31m 
(2008:  77m). This lower level of average cash
reflects the higher levels of working capital required
as construction activity has slowed. The Group's
financial position remains strong which, combined
with our debt facilities of  100m available 
through to mid-201 2, leaves us well placed to 
take advantage of opportunities presented by 
our markets.
Long-term strategy supported 
by emphasis on robust financial
disciplines
Our long-term strategy continues to be the
achievement of leading positions in all our chosen
markets. Delivering a quality construction service 
in close collaboration with our clients is a key
component in achieving this aim.
In 2009 the Fit Out division experienced a
considerable contraction in the commercial 
office sector, resulting in reductions in revenue 
and operating profit. In challenging market
conditions the division remained focused on
securing profitable opportunities rather than
securing revenue at any cost and it is our view 
that the division performed well in maintaining 
its market leading position and healthy operating
profit margin.
The Construction and Infrastructure Services
divisions both delivered record results, increasing
operating profit and margin in 2009, based largely
on the strength of their positions in the public and
regulated sectors, combined with an increased
capability to take on larger and more complex
projects. The Construction division also benefited
from further improvements resulting from its
continuing Perfect Delivery quality programme. 
The Affordable Housing division maintained its
revenue and generated an excellent operating
profit during the year given the difficult market
conditions for open market housing. This was 
due to strong new build contracting and
refurbishment demand for social housing 
which helped to counteract reductions in
profitability from sales of open market housing.
The Urban Regeneration division delivered a
satisfactory performance in 2009 and contributed 
a small profit in a very subdued market, aided in
some part by the recovery in sales of open market
housing. The business remains ideally positioned to
take advantage of future opportunities as occupier
demand recovers.
The Investments unit secured a number of new
projects during the year and is currently at
preferred bidder stage on several high value
schemes. The directors' valuation of the investment
portfolio held by the division increased during the
year to  38m (2008:  28m).
We report more fully on each division in the
business review that follows this statement. 
Since the beginning of 2008 we have realised
annualised savings of  38m and we continue 
to focus on working capital management, cost
reduction and supply chain improvements, as 
well as responding to market growth opportunities
where they present themselves.
Changes to the Board
We welcomed Patrick De Smedt to the Board 
as a non-executive director in December 2009. 
In addition, we are pleased to announce that 
Simon Gulliford will join the Board as a non-
executive director on 1 March 2010. Simon 
has particular experience in the area of strategic
marketing both as a consultant and in an 
executive capacity. 
Patrick and Simon's experience will further enhance
the range of skills and abilities our non-executive
directors bring to the Board.
Jon Walden will leave the Board at the forthcoming
annual general meeting after nine years as a non-
executive director; we thank him for his valuable
contribution during his time with the Group.

Opportunities are presented in
continued challenging markets
Whilst we expect that our markets will remain
challenging in 2010, as many of them continue 
to be impacted by the effects of the economic
downturn, we are seeing some signs of recovery 
in demand for open market housing and demand
for fit out from the financial services sector. This,
combined with the strength of our order book 
and projects progressed to preferred bidder stage,
should help to offset some of the effect of the
expected further weakening of public sector
spending. We have taken positive and timely action
as overall construction activity has slowed and we
will continue to take the necessary steps to shape
our business as the market changes.
At the same time, however, we will continue 
to assess all new market opportunities that 
arise and use our track record, expertise and
operational and financial strength to exploit 
them where appropriate.
Fit Out is well positioned to respond to signs 
of improved demand for major projects in the
commercial office market, especially demand 
from the financial services sector, and will focus 
on growing its share of the retail banking, hotel 
and education sectors. 
Construction's focus on sectors with growth
potential such as prisons, airports, defence and 
rail and its capability to deliver larger projects 
will help counter the effects of a subdued
commercial market and any future public 
sector spending reductions.
Infrastructure Services' medium and longer-term
growth potential in the energy and transport
sectors, driven by investment in key infrastructure
projects, will complement the division's strong
presence in the utilities market. 
Affordable Housing will focus on exploiting 
the improving open market housing sector 
and on the latest round of social housing 
PFI opportunities, as well as growing its new
responsive maintenance offering alongside 
its existing refurbishment expertise. 
Having secured substantial regeneration projects 
in the past few years, Urban Regeneration will
continue to progress each of its current schemes,
although we expect its market to remain subdued
in the short-term. With its quality portfolio the
division retains an excellent platform for growth 
as occupier demand returns in the medium-term.
The Investments unit has a healthy pipeline of
PPP/PFI schemes to pursue alongside the five
operating divisions. In addition to the construction
revenue to be created for the other divisions, these
schemes are expected to increase the unit's long-
term investment income.
Our forward order book at the start of 2010 stood
at  3.2bn (2008:  3.7bn). We also started 2010 
with over  0.9bn (2008:  nil) of projects at
preferred bidder stage. This element of potential
work was created entirely during 2009 and reflects
our capability to deliver large and more complex
schemes. In addition, Urban Regeneration's forward
development pipeline (its share of regeneration
projects in which it has an interest) was valued at
 1.4bn (2008:  1.3bn). 
The Group produced a robust performance in 
2009 against a backdrop of challenging trading
conditions. Although we face similar conditions in
2010, our breadth of capability gives us confidence
that we are well placed to capitalise on the
opportunities presented by our markets.
