practices. The estate staff and plantation workers are provided 
with housing that are supplied with the necessary amenities such 
as pipe water, electricity and basic furnishing which are regularly

environmental Management
The Company practices sustainable oil palm cultivation as its estate was 
converted from former rubber plantation and not on virgin forest land.  
Several measures are taken to ensure that the natural biological system 
of its estate is preserved, such as the emphasis on the use of organic 
fertilisers ie. waste product from the palm oil mills such as empty fruit 
bunches and decanter cake.  Pest control through natural means such 
as building of barn owl boxes to attract owls for rat control and planting 
of Turnera subulata plants as a habitat for wasp which is a predator of 
bagworms are also given priority to ensure minimum disruption to the 
natural environment.  Pesticides and inorganic fertilizers are applied under 
stringent controls according to professional agronomist recommendations. 
The oil palm plantation also acts as a water catchment area, assist to 
prevent soil erosion and provide oxygen to the air.
