 Northgate plc Annual report and accounts 2010 Review  2
Chairman's statement
I am pleased to present my first report 
since joining the Group in February. Let 
me start with an historical perspective.
By the end of the 2008 financial year the 
Group had aggressively expanded its fleet 
to a level of 68,600 vehicles in the UK and 
62,750 in Spain, but some of this growth 
had been at the expense of margins. 
When the recession hit, utilisation levels 
fell in 2009 to 88% in the UK and 
83% in Spain, compared to historic rates 
of over 90% and the problem was 
exacerbated by a dramatic fall in vehicle 
residual values in both the UK and Spain.
This put inordinate strain on the balance 
sheet and, at the beginning of the 
financial year, the Group raised  108m 
( 77m net of equity and debt 
arrangement fees) from a rights issue, 
thus refinancing its debt and securing the 
capital structure up until September 2012. 
By the end of 2009 the UK fleet numbers 
had fallen to 62,900 vehicles and in 
Spain to 60,400. This process continued 
in 2010 with the UK fleet falling by 3% 
to 60,900 vehicles and in Spain falling 
by 19% to 48,900.
Going forward, the focus of the Group 
will be to maintain utilisation in excess 
of 90%, improve operating efficiency 
to reduce costs and to concentrate on 
increasing the return on capital employed 
(ROCE), the key performance measure for 
the Group, above levels previously 
achieved.
The combination of the rights issue, 
strong cash generation and improved 
profitability has produced the following 
results for the year ended 30 April 2010:

).
The Board has debated the dividend issue 
long and hard and, on balance, has 
decided that it is not yet prudent to pay a 
dividend. The Company is facing difficult 
economic conditions in both the UK and 
Spain. There will be major government 
cutbacks which will reduce demand for 
some vehicle units, but our flexible model 
may well prove attractive to customers 
who struggle to raise the capital for  
Since the refinancing last year, we  
have met substantially all of our  
targets. Going forward, we will 
concentrate on doing simple things 
very well. We will complete the UK 
restructuring. We will develop 
further plans for Spain, which is 
already significantly more 
operationally efficient than the UK, 
and will continue to focus on margin. 
Our aim is 90% utilisation and if we  
need to further reduce the fleet so  
be it. Maximising returns and  
charging fully for ancillary services  
will be our prime targets.  
The Group has begun the new  
financial year in line with 
expectations .
 
outright purchase or do not wish to 
commit to long-term lease or contract 
hire. As we focus our efforts on SME 
customers we will carefully monitor 
debtor age profiles. We will continue 
to concentrate on conserving cash and 
paying down debt.
UK 
Our underlying UK rental margin
5
  
increased to 18.5%, compared to 12.8% 
in 2009 and utilisation rates in the UK 
averaged 91% (2009 - 88%). This was 
achieved by continuing the actions taken 
in 2009 to improve fleet management 
and to focus on hire rate improvement. 
This was alongside improved market 
conditions, particularly in the used vehicle 
market, where much improved residual 
prices for second-hand vehicles 
contributed  6.5m towards operating 
profit (2009 -  14.4m reduction in 
operating profit).
Historically, the Group had operated 
through 20 hire companies across the 
UK, each with its own local brand and 
management. There was a great degree 
of rivalry between these businesses 
which did not always operate in the 
best interests of either the Group or the 
customer. By the end of August 2010, 
the 20 companies will become 
12 business areas operating under the 
Northgate Vehicle Hire brand. 
A decision was taken in April to 
commence a restructuring of the UK 
business to significantly improve our 
efficiency and establish a solid base for 
growing the business and improving 
customer service whilst also increasing the 
operating margin. Along with this radical 
overhaul of the UK operating structure, 
we see the opportunity for significant cost 
savings, for example in maintenance, 
repair and overheads.
An inordinate amount of time had been 
dedicated in trying to develop an IT system 
to meet the requirements of all the 
separate companies within the Group. 
This could not be achieved. We are now 
adopting standardised operating 
procedures for all of our units and have 
chosen a proprietary IT solution to meet 
our needs. The implementation of this 
Group wide IT system should be complete 
by April 2011. This will reduce our costs 
and give us much better information  
about the profitability of our activities, 
processes and services. Taken together  Northgate plc Annual report and accounts 2010 Review  3
with the consolidation of operating units 
and the Board changes set out below, this 
should result in annualised cost savings 
of over  10m from April 2011.
We are also establishing a national 
sales team to concentrate on our core 
SME customers.
Spain 
Our Spanish business operates in an 
extremely difficult environment, 
particularly in the construction and related 
sectors. Despite approximately 60% of 
our business coming from these sectors, 
we have made progress in a number of 
operational areas. Improved fleet 
management has, in turn, improved 
average utilisation. Indeed, utilisation in 
the last two months of the year averaged 
90%. A major contributory factor has 
been the successful introduction of a 
used vehicle disposal capability based 
on our UK experience. We introduced 
a retail website and further developed 
our wholesale disposal channel. As a 
direct consequence we were able to 
dispose of 19,800 vehicles (an increase 
of 50% on the previous year) at higher 
residual values.
In Spring 2009, the Record head office 
in Castell n was closed and its operations 
were integrated into the Fualsa head 
office in Madrid. I have to report that 
this resulted in considerable operating 
problems. This compounded the bad 
debt situation which was already under 
pressure from high levels of bankruptcy 
within the local economy. The bad debt 
charge for the year increased to  10.3m 
(2009 -  3.7m). Both the CEO and CFO 
in Spain have been replaced and our new 
team in Spain has made an excellent start 
and is concentrating on resolving the 
inherited administration problems. The 
bad debt charge in the second half of the 
year was reduced by  1.3m compared to 
the first half of the year and there was a 
significant improvement in debt collection 
resulting in a  50.6m (35.2%) reduction 
in Spanish debtors compared with 
31 October 2009. 
Balance sheet 
During the year net debt has reduced by 
 288m to  598m. This was primarily as a 
result of the rights issue proceeds of  77m 
(net of equity and debt arrangement fees), 
continued strong EBITDA (earnings before 
interest, taxation, depreciation and 
amortisation) of  306m and working 
capital of  39m, with net interest 
payments of  48m and net capital 
expenditure on vehicles of  110m being 
 61m lower than in the previous year.
It is important that the Group has secure 
financing to support the business across 
the economic cycle. At 30 April 2010 we 
had net debt
6
 of  598m, which gave us 
headroom of  240m on our committed 
debt facilities of  865m. Net debt to 
EBITDA was 2.0 (2009 - 2.5) and 
headroom on all covenants improved 
since the date of refinancing.
Our committed facilities mature in 
September 2012 and we will assess the 
appropriate timing of refinancing well 
ahead of its maturity.
Board changes 
On becoming Chairman one of my first 
tasks, with the assistance of the 
Nominations Committee, has been to  
decide on the future management 
structure of the Group.
The Chief Executive, Steve Smith, 
originally intended to retire on 31 July 
2009 but had agreed to stay on to guide 
the Group through its refinancing, placing 
and rights issue during very difficult 
trading conditions. Having successfully 
completed the task, Steve stood down on 
31 March 2010. I would like to thank him 
not only for his efforts in the last 12  
months but also for more than 20 years 
of dedicated service. He was very helpful in 
introducing me to the Group when I 
became Chairman.
Alan Noble founded the business in 
February 1981 and was the driving force 
behind its early growth. Regrettably due 
to ill health, he retired from the business 
on 31 March 2010. I would like to thank 
him for his many years of dedicated 
service to the Group.
As part of the review, Phil Moorhouse, 
UK Managing Director, agreed to bring 
forward his retirement from 31 December 
2010 to 31 March 2010. I would like to 
personally thank Phil for the objective 
insights into the UK business which he 
has given me.
Bob Contreras, our Group Finance Director 
since June 2008, was appointed Chief 
Executive on 7 June 2010. I am confident 
that he will drive the business forward, 
implement the necessary changes agreed 
by the Board and focus on maximising 
returns over the coming years. We are 
currently conducting a thorough search 
for a Finance Director and will make an 
announcement in due course. 
Paul Tallentire, the Deputy Chief Executive, 
decided that his future lay outside 
the Group and we thank him for his 
contribution and wish him well for 
the future.
Current trading and future outlook 
Since the refinancing last year, we have 
met substantially all of our targets. Going 
forward, we will concentrate on doing 
simple things very well. We will complete 
the UK restructuring. We will develop 
further plans for Spain, which is already 
significantly more operationally efficient 
than the UK, and will continue to focus 
on margin. 
Our aim is 90% utilisation and if we need  
to further reduce the fleet so be it. 
Maximising returns and charging fully for 
ancillary services will be our prime targets.
The Group has begun the new financial 
year in line with expectations.
