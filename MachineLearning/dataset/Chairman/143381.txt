Chairman's Review
Overview
Our results for the year ended 31 March 2005 show progress 
in a period when the business has been through a number 
of major changes. We have appointed a new Chief Executive,
renegotiated banking arrangements, reviewed our organisational
structure and implemented a number of cost saving initiatives.
Loss making practices have been closed and management of 
the remaining 122 practices is now handled through a clearly
defined structure of 21 regionally based clusters. 
We have made much progress, but also acknowledge that 
there remain many challenges. The business is now on a 
much sounder footing which will enable the new management
team to implement the strategy to generate excellent returns 
for shareholders.
Actions implemented and progress
Stephen Lambert joined the company as Chief Executive on 2 August 2004. He has 
implemented a number of changes, which should deliver growth out of the practices.The
introduction of regional cluster groups has been positively received within the business and
is now fully operational.This will allow better utilisation of resources, ensure regional pricing
polices are enforced and build on in-house referral processes. In addition, recruitment of
dentists has been devolved back to the regional clusters allowing the company to benefit
from long established dental networks.The additional cost of cluster management will be
more than recovered by the incremental profits and reduction in central support costs.
The revised debt repayment structure will potentially allow up to  4.0 million to be invested
back into the business over the current year.This will, in the main, be targeted towards 
surgery refurbishment and extending the practice computerisation programme. Providing
modern, well-equipped surgeries is a key factor in the recruitment and retention of dentists.
Funds will also be available for the purchase of businesses from sole practising dentists 
who wish to join Oasis with current lists of patients.The corresponding uplift on 
profitability, where these businesses can be incorporated into existing sites with current
spare capacity, is significant.
Over the course of the year, the number of dentists working within the Group has remained
stable, although time gaps in the recruitment process have had an impact on our results this
year. We already have a significant number of overseas dentists working for us and the
pipeline of candidates continues to grow, but we remain frustrated at the delays built into

the process of registering foreign dentists.
Nevertheless, we are optimistic that 
utilisation rates will continue to improve
over the next 12 months as a result of our
recruitment policies.
A number of our practices have entered
into early Personal Dentistry Service (PDS)
arrangements with the local Primary Care
Trusts resulting in more certain income
streams, allowing us to attract dentists in
areas where we have previously struggled
to recruit.The full devolvement of 
commissioning NHS provision from the
Department of Health to local Primary 
Care Trusts (PCTs) has now been moved
back to 1 April 2006. We remain in 
negotiation with a number of PCTs to 
agree contracts before this date.
Strategy for growth
A clear strategy for growth has been
devised. Central to this plan is the change 
of culture within the business to a focus 
on performance.
Oasis, across its estate, needs to optimise
the utilisation of its surgeries. We are 
tackling this through recruitment and
investment, the latter now possible 
through the financial restructuring that 
was completed towards the end of the 
year. We also have put in place incentive
schemes throughout the business to reward
performance at cluster and individual 
practice level.
We have set ourselves benchmarks across
both financial and operating performance
to drive the business forward, and also 
continue to believe that the macro and 
regulatory changes in our industry suggest
that businesses such as Oasis will be able
to grow and prosper.

Results
Turnover increased by  1 million from
 73.9 million to  74.9 million; after 
adjusting for three fewer working days 
and excluding the turnover from sites that
have been closed, the comparable increase
is 2.9%.The trend towards a higher 
percentage of private treatments continued
and now accounts for 65.2% of turnover.
The well-publicised shortage of dentists
within the UK continued to be a limiting
factor in the growth of the business.
Operating profit before exceptional 
items and goodwill amortisation charges
increased from  3.5 million to  3.9 
million.This increase is after higher 
depreciation charges of  2.1 million 
(2004:  1.9 million) arising from our 
continuing capital expenditure programme
designed to maintain and upgrade the high
standard of working environment for our
dentists and professional staff.
At the practice level we measure 
performance based on EBITDA. For the
year just ended, practice EBITDA was 
 9.1 million at 12.2% of turnover 
compared to  9.3 million at 12.5% 
of turnover in the previous year. This 
reduction in profitability came as a result 
of changes that had to be made to dental
remuneration contracts at former Ora sites.
Despite this change, overall profitability 
at the group EBITDA level has improved as
a result of savings made within our central
support costs.These have been reduced to
 3.15 million from  3.80 million previously
and now account for 4.2% of turnover
compared to 5.1%. As a result the group
EBITDA increased from  5.46 million to
 5.96 million.
As indicated in our interim report and 
trading statement we have incurred 
exceptional costs within the period of 
 1.1 million relating to a company-wide
restructuring programme, and the decision 
to close three loss-making shop-front 
dental practices in central London.
Additionally we have provided in full for
the write down of goodwill at four other
practices at a cost of  0.7 million and 
written off  0.15 million of arrangement
fees relating to the previous banking
arrangements bringing the total exceptional
cost up to  1.95 million.
The net interest charge for the year was
 2.5 million (2004:  2.3 million) with the
increase mainly arising from the effect of
increased interest charges on our floating
rate debt. Interest cover based on operating
profit before amortisation of goodwill and
exceptional items is approximately 1.5
times (2004: 1.5 times), and cash interest
cover is approximately 2.2 times (2004: 
2.3 times) based on the pre-exceptional
operating cash flows.
Net of all charges Oasis incurred a loss 
before tax of  2.9 million (2004:  3.4 million).
This loss is after deduction of goodwill 
amortisation charges of  2.3 million (2004:
 2.4 million) and exceptional charges of
 1.95 million (2004:  2.2 million). After
adjusting for the exceptional items and the
amortisation charge the full year profit is
 1.35 million (2004:  1.2 million). 
Basic loss per share was 3.41p (2004:
4.14p).The earnings per share adjusted to
exclude the impact of the exceptional items
and the amortisation charge is a profit per
share of 1.78p (2004: 1.53p).
Cash flow and net debt
Pre-exceptional operating cash flow from
the business increased to  5.5 million
(2004:  5.2 million). Our net debt position
at the end of the year was  39.5 million
(2004:  40.1 million). On 30 March 2005,
the Group concluded negotiations with the
Bank of Scotland to reduce quarterly 
scheduled loan repayments over the next

five years from  26.5 million to  12.5 
million, removing uncertainty from the
Group's funding arrangements.The average
cost of this debt is 1.6% above LIBOR and
MLA costs. The Group also has in place
hedging arrangements giving an average
LIBOR rate of 4.7% for the year to 31 March
2006 on all the term debt and beyond that
period through to 31 March 2010 a fixed
rate of 5.13% on  24.75 million of the term
debt with a cap of 5.5% on the floating rate
element. This further strengthens the 
financial position of the Group.

We today announce the appointment 
of Guy Blomfield as Operations Director
and to the Group Board with immediate

as a consultant for the past six months.
The Board also announces that Jeremy

and staff for the excellent contributions
made to the Group over the last year. 
Outlook
The key changes outlined in the operating
review provide the foundations to deliver
growth in turnover and profitability over the
next 12 months. Early indications in April
and May point to an increase in turnover
compared to the same period last year
combined with a clear increase in 
recruitment activity.The Board is confident
that the new organisational structure, 
the focus on improving utilisation in the
existing estate and the security provided 
by the new funding platform will allow a 
success to be made from the corporate 
dentistry model.
