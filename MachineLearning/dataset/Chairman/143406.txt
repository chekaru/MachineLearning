 Obtala Resources Limited
2 Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2010
Chairman's Statement
I am pleased to present the annual report and consolidated financial statements for Obtala Resources Limited (Obtala  or the
Company ) for the year ended 31 December 2010.
This was an eventful year for Obtala, which successfully completed its re-organisation into an international Group under an AIM
listed Guernsey holding company, Obtala Resources Limited, and also saw the commencement of diamond sales from its
alluvial mining operation in Sierra Leone. The Sierra Leone Hard Rock diamond operation was combined with African Rock
Resources, a privately held company with a diamond exploration licence in Tanzania, to create a new group which was listed
on AIM as Paragon Diamonds Limited (Paragon ) in November 2010. In December 2010, Paragon acquired a 44.3 per cent.
interest in International Diamond Consultants Limited (IDC ), a private diamond exploration group holding licences in both
Lesotho and Zambia. Obtala owned 61.3 per cent. of its Paragon subsidiary at 31 December 2010.
During the year, Obtala also acquired an 80 per cent. interest in a lithium brine exploration project in Argentina as well as
continuing to conduct geological prospecting over its portfolio of assets in Tanzania, including its early stage gold, base metal
and iron ore projects. In addition, the Group made good progress in developing its Tanzanian agricultural interests and trial
farming to optimise crops will take place in 2011.
Subsequent to the year end, Obtala has further expanded its asset base with the conditional acquisition of a 37 per cent.
interest in a near-term tin deposit in South Africa, together with interests of 32 per cent. and 34 per cent. in two South African
iron ore projects and Paragon has increased its interest in IDC up to 98.5 per cent. In addition, both Obtala and Paragon
completed successful fundraisings of  6 million and  2.9 million respectively in early 2011.
Financial results
The Group remained development focused in the year ended 31 December 2010 but did commence diamond production and
sales in the final quarter which generated revenues of  0.8 million in addition to diamond distribution income of  0.2 million.
The loss after tax for the year amounted to  5.8 million (2009: profit  1.8 million) after allowance for a  2.9 million non-cash
impairment of intangible licence assets charge (2009:  1.8 million) and a  0.5 million loss on investing activities (2009: gain
 5.7 million). Also included in the results for the year are  0.7 million of one-off costs relating to the re-organisation of the
Group under an AIM listed Guernsey holding company and the admission of Paragon on to the AIM market.
A gain of  5.6 million arising on the deemed partial disposal of the Group's interest in its Sierra Leone/Paragon operation
which reduced from a holding of 100 per cent. to 61.3 per cent., was recognised directly to equity during the year.
Net equity attributable to shareholders of Obtala at 31 December 2010 amounted to  38.3 million (2009:  30.3 million). Net
assets, including those attributable to minority interests in Paragon, amounted to  44.1 million (2009:  30.3 million) and Group
cash balances amounted to  8.8 million (2009:  5.0 million).
Corporate investing activities
Obtala has augmented its pure exploration and development activities with complementary investment activities, focusing on
opportunities in the natural resources sector. Whilst the Group has traded in numerous equity and derivative investments in order
to enhance shareholder value, its primary investment has been in the combination of equity and derivative instruments that
Obtala held in Kopane Diamonds Developments plc (Kopane ). Kopane was acquired by Firestone Diamonds Plc under an
all share offer in the second half of 2010. Obtala disposed of its entire remaining interests in this investment generating cash
proceeds of  2.8 million during the year. Overall, Obtala realised a profit of  4.4 million on this investment, of which  5.7 million
arose in 2009 inclusive of some unrealised gains which reversed in the current year to realise a loss in 2010 of  1.3 million.
Gains of  0.8 million on other equity and derivative holdings, reduced the reported loss on investing activities in the year to
 0.5 million (2009: gain  5.7 million).
Paragon
Obtala successfully completed the Initial Public Offering of its diamond business during the year which saw the Group's wholly
owned subsidiary, Sierra Leone Hard Rock Limited, combined with African Rock Resources Limited to create a new AIM listed
group under the name of Paragon Diamonds Limited. At the same time Paragon raised gross funds of  3.8 million by way of
issuing approximately 1 7 per cent. of its enlarged issued share capital. Obtala held 61.3 per cent. of Paragon at the year end
with a consolidated net asset value of  9 million after deduction of minority interests. The market value of this stake at that date
was approximately  24 million. Obtala Resources Limited
Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 3
Since listing, Paragon has successfully completed the acquisition of a 98.5 per cent. interest in IDC in two tranches, the first
being in December 2010 which was settled by issuing 23,397 ,894 new ordinary shares in Paragon equivalent to  5.7 million.
The second was in May 2011 and was settled by issuing 36,607 ,705 new ordinary shares in Paragon equivalent to  12.1 million.
IDC holds the Lemphane Prospecting Licence which covers a known kimberlite pipe in the world renowned diamondiferous
region of the Kingdom of Lesotho. The Lemphane Prospecting Licence lies within the Botha-Buthe district of northern Lesotho,
29 km west of the Letseng Diamond Mine and 5 km north west of the Liqhobong Deposit. In addition, IDC holds the Kabale
licence in Zambia, which is deemed prospective for kimberlites.
Greenhills (subsequent to year end)
In February 2011 Obtala agreed to purchase a 50 per cent. interest in Greenhills Resources Limited (Greenhills ) for
US$4 million, with payments staggered over 12 months and funds being initially utilised to develop tin production in 2012.
Completion is conditional on satisfactory due diligence by Obtala and is expected to take place by Q3 2011.
Through the acquisition, Obtala will receive a 37 per cent. interest in the underlying Mokopane Tin Project, located in one of
South Africa's most important historical tin fields, Zaaiplaats, lying within the northern limb of the Bushveld Complex of South
Africa. The project already has 3,400 tonnes of near-surface open pittable tin identified by Greenhills in one of five target areas
identified to date with significant scope to increase to 20,000 tonnes of open pittable tin. The immediate objective is to define
a resource in excess of 10,000 tonnes of contained tin within the Mokopane Tin Project.
Bushveld (subsequent to year end)
In March 2011 the Group agreed to purchase a 50 per cent. interest in the issued share capital of Bushveld Resources Limited
(Bushveld ) for consideration of US$500,000 in cash and 11,949,378 new ordinary shares in Obtala. Completion is conditional
on satisfactory renewal of the underlying prospecting licences and is expected to take place by Q3 2011.
This acquisition will give the Group interests of 32 per cent. and 34 per cent. respectively in Bushveld's subsidiaries that hold
the licences which comprise the Mokopane Iron Ore Project, which covers 7 ,409 hectares in South Africa. Mokopane has an
estimated potential for approximately 2 billion tonnes of iron ore within a magnetite hosted deposit which also hosts some
titanium and vanadium resource. The deposit is located in close proximity to the world's largest open pit platinum mine and
associated infrastructure.
Directorate changes
The Obtala Board has been strengthened during the year with the addition of Lord St John of Bletso on 1 7 May 2010 and
James Ede-Golightly on 14 September 2010, both as Non-executive Directors. I would like to take this opportunity to welcome
them to the Board and thank them for their contributions to date.
Outlook
The year to 31 December 2010 was one of considerable development for Obtala and it is already evident that 2011 will be
another eventful year for the Group. I look forward to the rest of 2011 with confidence as we rapidly develop our existing and
newly acquired assets whilst also assessing any potential future opportunities. I am particularly optimistic that the Group will
be able to report significant progress in exploiting its Mokopane Iron and Tin projects as well as development of Paragon's
Lemphane Kimberlite project in Lesotho.
The Group benefits from a strong balance sheet with cash balances of  8.8 million at 31 December 2010, which together with
the subsequent fundraisings in early 2011of  6 million in Obtala and  2.9 million in Paragon, leaves it well placed to build
businesses with great potential and generate further value for shareholders.
Finally I would thank my colleagues and our employees for all their hard work throughout the year and look forward to a
successful and eventful 2011.
