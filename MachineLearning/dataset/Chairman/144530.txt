mitigated through a series of farm 
out agreements. In 2012 the Group 
is undertaking the busiest drilling 
programme in its history, with 
drilling continuing in Tanzania,  
a rig procured for an imminent 
programme in Equatorial Guinea 
and nine wells expected to be 
spudded by the end of the year. 
The Group has recently announced 
the results of the Jodari-1 well 
drilled during January and 
February 2012. This was the first 
well drilled with BG as operator 
and resulted in the Group's fourth 
successive, and largest in the 
Group's history, gas discovery in its 
Tanzania blocks with a recoverable 
resource estimate of 3.4 TCF. 
Preparations are also underway for 
a 12 well programme in 2013. 
Ophir ended 2011 with net 
contingent (2C) resources of 210 
mmboe and net risked prospective 
resources of 1,882 mmboe.
Portfolio Management
Ophir continues to actively manage 
its portfolio to best deploy its 
capital resources against the most 
prospective acreage and plays. 
In 2011 the Group farmed out 
interests in the Mbeli and Ntsina 
licences in Gabon to Petrobras and 
an interest in the AGC Profond 
licence to Noble Energy. The Group 
acquired interests in the East 
Pande licence in Tanzania by 
way of a farm in agreement with 
RAKGas and acquired five further 
exploration interests via the 
Dominion transaction in Block 7 
(Tanzania), Blocks L9 and L15 
(Kenya), Area 4B (Uganda) and 
Block 5 (DRC). Ophir currently 
has interests in 22 licences in 11 
countries and jurisdictions, 14 
of which are operated, 18 of 
which are offshore and 4 of which 
are onshore.
Chairman's and Chief Executive Officer's  
Joint Review
2011 was dominated by Ophir's IPO, which raised a  
total of US$384 million inclusive of the greenshoe.  
The IPO provided the Group with a strong cash position 
of US$396.6 million at year end. 
Corporate Overview
2011 saw Ophir successfully list  
on the main board of the London 
Stock Exchange. Ophir joined the 
FTSE 250 in November 2011. The 
IPO was set against a backdrop 
of turbulent capital markets and 
relatively low levels of new equity 
issuance and Ophir ended the year 
as the best performing IPO stock 
for 2011.
In October 2011 Ophir announced 
a proposal to acquire the share 
capital of AIM-listed Dominion 
Petroleum Ltd in an all-stock 
transaction. The acquisition closed 
in February 2012 and expanded 
the Group's portfolio in East Africa 
via the addition of five exploration 
licences, with three being 
complementary to Ophir's 
existing deepwater portfolio. As  
a result Ophir now has one of the 
largest portfolios of operated  
and non-operated acreage in the 
exciting emerging offshore East 
African play.
Operationally, 2011 saw two wells 
completed. The Chewa-1 well in 
Tanzania was the third in a series  
of back-to-back gas discoveries in 
Tanzania. The Kora-1 well in the 
AGC joint development area was 
unsuccessful but costs were  Ophir Energy plc Annual Report 2011

Financial
2011 was dominated by Ophir's 
IPO, which raised a total of $384 
million inclusive of the greenshoe. 
The IPO provided the Group with a 
strong cash position of $396.6 
million at year end. A further equity 
placing in April 2012 raised an 
additional gross US$242 million. 
We are fully funded to finance the 
planned exploration programmes 
for the next 12 months.
Board, Management and Staff
The evolution of Ophir's Board 
during 2011 reflects the transition 
to being a public company. During 
2011 Dr Nick Cooper, Mr Ron 
Blakely and Mr Patrick Spink joined 
the Board while Mr Rajan Tandon 
appointed Mr Jaroslaw Paczek as 
his alternate. At IPO Mr Michael 
Cohen, Mr Mikki Xayiya left the 
Board, Ms Yvonne Holm and Mr 
John Morgan left later in the year. 
On behalf of the Board and 
shareholders the Chairman has 
thanked those that served on the 
Board for their contributions and 
has welcomed those that join the 
Board as we embark upon the next 
stage in Ophir's growth.
Ophir's senior management team 
was expanded in June 2011 with 
the appointment of Dr Nick Cooper 
as Chief Executive Officer, replacing 
Dr Alan Stein who held that position 
since formation of the Group in 
2004. Alan remains an active 
member of the executive team but 
has signalled his intention to step 
down from the Board after the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM )  
in June 2012. In December 2011, 
Yvonne Holm resigned from her 
position of Chief Financial Officer 
and Director, and in January 2012, 
Lisa Mitchell, previously Ophir's 
Group Financial Controller, was 
appointed as CFO.
At the heart of our Group is a small 
yet dedicated and extremely 
professional group of staff and 
associates who have consistently 
delivered outstanding performance. 
This last year has seen the team 
raise the bar once again. Their 
tireless efforts might sometimes 
pass without comment but they are 
always appreciated. On behalf of 
the Board and shareholders we 
would like to offer them our thanks 
and admiration for another 
outstanding year for the Group.
This year of performance has been 
delivered without compromising  
on safety and we are pleased to 
report no lost time accidents or 
reported incidents across the diverse 
range of operations undertaken 
across the African continent in 
often challenging conditions.
Corporate Responsibility
Corporate Responsibility forms a 
key part of Ophir's operating culture. 
The Group strives to make a positive 
impact in the development of the 
countries in which it operates. 
Ophir's goal is to establish a 
sustainable, balanced approach to 
its business which includes assisting 
local communities wherever possible 
through such initiatives as education, 
protection of the environment  
and the creation of broad, lasting 
economic development. We 
understand that by taking a 
pragmatic, long-term, positive 
approach to corporate responsibility 
it will provide lasting dividends to 
the Group and the countries in 
which we operate. Ophir Energy plc Annual Report 2011

Chairman's and Chief Executive Officer's  
Joint Review continued
At the heart of our Company is a small yet dedicated 
and extremely professional group of staff and 
associates who have consistently delivered 
outstanding performance.
In Tanzania, Ophir has continued  
to be actively involved in the 
development of Mtwara port  
(and its attendant services). Ophir 
was responsible for the initial 
development of this facility in 
partnership with the Tanzanian 
authorities. In 2011 the port 
development scheme expanded 
rapidly as more oil and gas operating 
companies joined Ophir, resulting 
in the transformation of a previously 
underutilised port into a thriving 
operations base which has 
subsequently received  Duty Free' 
status to underscore its importance 
to the development of the Mtwara 
region. There has been a large 
positive impact in the local economy 
as the community shares in this 
development through training, 
employment and improved 
infrastructure. In December 2011, 
parts of the main city of Dar es 
Salaam suffered severe flooding, 
making many citizens homeless. 
Ophir assisted relocation efforts  
by swiftly donating 30 large water 
storage tanks to the victim's 
resettlement site. This initiative 
secured adequate sanitation and 
was vital to reduce disease risk for 
the flood victims whilst in their 
temporary accommodation.
In Equatorial Guinea, Ophir continued 
its support of a nursery school in 
the village of Ebein Yenkeng. The 
Group also donated funding for a 
training seminar on social content 
which was provided to members of 
the Ministry of Mines, Minerals 
and Energy (MMIE ) in Malabo. In 
addition, Ophir contributes to the 
Equatorial Guinean Hydrocarbon 
Technological Institute Educational 
Programme (ITNHGE ), a 
collaborative educational initiative 
run for the benefit of adult 
students in Equatorial Guinea.
Outlook
The oil and gas industry's focus  
on African exploration has risen 
dramatically in 2011 and early 2012. 
The pace of activity on both the 
East African offshore gas play and 
the West African pre-salt play have 
increased as major oil companies 
have entered the region and made 
significant discoveries. This has  
had important implications for 
Ophir's portfolio.
In the East African gas play Anadarko 
and ENI are reported to have 
discovered more than 40 TCF of gas 
in Mozambique with the majority 
being found in extensive basin 
floor fans. This play has not yet been 
tested in Ophir's Tanzanian acreage 
but it is thought to potentially 
extend into Block 1 and possibly 
Block 3. A new 3D seismic survey is 
currently being acquired in Block 1 
to test this concept and initial results 
are anticipated mid-year. Ophir Energy plc Annual Report 2011

BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In the adjacent Tanzania Block 2 
Statoil's recent Zafarani-1 discovery 
appears to have de-risked elements 
of the deeper Cretaceous play 
potential within Ophir's acreage. 
Some of the wells in Ophir's 2012 
drilling programme will also test 
these deeper plays.
The industry's appetite for the  
East African offshore gas play has 
been clearly demonstrated by the 
competitive bidding to acquire 
AIM-listed Cove Energy which has 
an 8.5% stake in the Anadarko 
operated block in Mozambique,  
to the south of BG/Ophir's Block 1. 
If this appetite is sustained then it 
affords Ophir a degree of flexibility 
both in the way that it finances its 
exploration and appraisal activities 
in the play and in the way that it 
secures value for shareholders.
The Group now has one of the 
largest offshore acreage footprints 
in East Africa. In addition to the 
wells currently being drilled by the 
Ophir/BG joint venture in Blocks 1, 
3 and 4, offset wells with relevance 
to Ophir acreage will be drilled in 
the next few months by Petrobras 
and Statoil in Tanzania, Anadarko 
and ENI in Mozambique and Apache 
in Kenya.
In West Africa, considerable recent 
success has occurred in the 
deepwater pre-salt play with notable 
successes by both Cobalt and Maersk 
in Angola. Ophir has a strong acreage 
position in this deepwater play, 
with four licences in Gabon and one 
in Congo-Brazzaville. In Gabon, the 
Group has recently completed two 
seismic programmes that will 
support both a pre-salt well with 
Petrobras in late 2012 on the Mbeli 
and Ntsina licences and also 
potential farm outs of the Manga 
and Gnondo licences.
In 2012 Q2, the Group will commence 
a three well programme in 
Equatorial Guinea targeting further 
gas discoveries to aggregate into 
an LNG development. Already the 
Group is planning for a further 12 
well programme in 2013 
contingent on additional financing.
The outlook for Ophir in 2012 is 
promising. The Group enters 2012 
with an extensive portfolio of 
interests across some of the most 
interesting exploration plays in 
Africa. The Group is well placed to 
meet its exploration and appraisal 
forecast expenditure for at least 
the next 12 months.
