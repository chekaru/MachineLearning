 As Parkmead drives forward to become a significant new 
independent oil and gas company, I am pleased to announce our 
audited results for the year ended 30 June 2012 and to share with 
you our progress to date, in what has been a busy and successful 
year of asset growth.
 
Operations and Portfolio Growth 
The Group has made considerable early progress towards its stated 
goal of building a significant independent oil and gas company. 
During 2012, the Company made a number of acquisitions across 
the UKCS and Netherlands demonstrating the Board's intentions 
to grow the business rapidly through acquisitions, alongside organic 
growth. As a result, Parkmead's reserve base has transformed in the 
last twelve months with the Group reporting a rapid growth in its 
oil and gas reserves to 25.1 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) 
of 2P Reserves and 10.3mmboe of 2C Contingent Resources.
In line with our strategy, Parkmead's team has shown a strong 
appetite for value accretive transactions, at both asset and corporate 
level, as we look to add opportunities across the entire spectrum 
from exploration through to appraisal, development and production. 
Parkmead is pleased to have added assets at every stage of the 
lifecycle through the four transactions agreed in 2012, creating a high 
quality and diverse asset base. In particular, we are delighted to have 
signed, and subsequently completed in August 2012, a milestone 
transaction which adds production to the Group's portfolio within 
the first year of establishing the oil and gas team.

The Parkmead Group plc 
Annual Report 2012
2012 has been an excellent first full year of E&P operations for The Parkmead Group. Following a successful 2011,
which saw the Company bring together its experienced oil and gas team, the Group has generated significant 
momentum completing a series of acquisitions in the North Sea and onshore Netherlands. Parkmead has built a high 
quality and balanced portfolio, with a rapid growth in its reserve base, and since the financial year end has achieved 
first production through the acquisition of assets in the Netherlands.
In October 2012 the Group was awarded interests in a total of 25 offshore blocks across the UKCS, in the 27th 
Licensing Round. These new licences will significantly increase Parkmead's asset base in the UK and complete what  
has been an exceptional year for the Company.  Acquisitions to date have focused on known opportunities in the 
Group's preferred area of Europe, and have ranged from stakes in 
oil and gas fields in the UKCS to a corporate transaction, acquiring 
DEO Petroleum plc, which completed in August 2012. We believe 
that the Group's high level of activity makes clear both the drive 
and ambition of our Company, and its staff, and creates a strong 
platform to become a key E&P player in the North Sea and beyond.
Parkmead is equally focused on building the business through 
organic growth, through licence applications, seismic and drilling, 
and via acquisition. During 2012, the Group made a major suite of 
applications for new UK licences in the UKCS 27th Licensing Round. 
I am very pleased to report that we have been successful in this 
licensing round, which was announced in October 2012, with the 
award of six licences comprising interests in a total of 25 offshore 
blocks and partial blocks across the Central North Sea, West of 
Scotland and West of Shetlands. Parkmead has also applied for 
certain licences in the 27th Round within the UKCS Southern Gas 
Basin. These are yet to be awarded by the UK Government due to 
their location close to, or in, certain Specific Areas of Conservation 
(SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs). In recognition of the 
specific expertise of the Parkmead technical team, we will lead the 
work programme as operator of these newly awarded UK assets, 
working closely with our joint-venture partners. Our oil and gas 
team will continue to utilise its detailed technical knowledge of 
certain proven and frontier areas to identify and acquire assets, and 
participate in further UK and international licensing rounds.
In August 2012, the Group was delighted to announce excellent 
drilling results from the Platypus appraisal well in the UK Southern 
North Sea. This horizontal well was successfully completed and 
flowed at 27 million standard cubic feet of gas per day. As we move 
into 2013, the Group has planned an active seismic and drilling 
programme across its portfolio of assets. 
Results
The Group's revenue for the year ending 30th June 2012 was 
 2.9m (2011:  3.7m). Administrative expenses were  5.5m 
(2011:  5.3m). The Group's operating loss for the year was  4.7m 
(2011:  3.6m). The loss after tax was  4.9m (2011:  3.6m). Total 
comprehensive loss for the year was  5.1m (2011: Income  35k).
The Group's total assets increased to  22.9m (2011:  12.3m), 
including available-for-sale financial assets of  6.5m (2011:  7.1m). 
Cash and cash equivalents increased to  7.7m (2011:  1.3m). The 
total current liabilities were  4.2m (2011:  1.1m) mainly due to 
increased trade and other payables of  4.1m (2011:  0.8m).
The Group net asset value increased to  12.3m (2011:  9.0m). 
There was a modest equity raising of  8.53m in March 2012, in line 
with the Group's authority to place 10% of equity for cash. This 
resulted in a total of 60,960,182 new ordinary shares being issued at 
a placing price of 14 pence (representing a discount of 8.5 per cent. 
to the Group's average closing mid market price over a 3 month 
period prior to the announcement of the placing, being 15.3 pence). 
In addition, some 4,857,142 new ordinary shares were issued on 
the exercise of options, bringing the Group's total ordinary shares in 
issue to 675,419,147 (2011: 609,601,823). Subsequent to the 30th 
June year-end, the Group completed the acquisition of fellow 
independent oil and gas company, DEO Petroleum plc. This 
acquisition was completed by way of a court sanctioned Scheme of 
Arrangement and offered DEO shareholders two Parkmead shares 
for every DEO share held. Following these 86,219,860 ordinary 
shares being admitted for trading, the Group's total ordinary shares 
in issue increased to 761,639,007.
As at 30 June 2012 Parkmead had drawn  2.9m of its  8.0m 
shareholder loan facility, which was raised in October 2011 in 
conjunction with the Group's first acquisition in the UK North Sea.
The Board is not recommending the payment of a dividend in 2012 
(2011: nil).
Investments
The Group's principal investment is shares held in Faroe Petroleum 
plc (Faroe ) (LSE AIM: FPM.L.). As at 30 June 2012 the value of 
this investment was  6.5m (30 June 2011:  7.1m). The investment 
is held as available-for-sale and the decrease in its value due to 
share price movement has been reflected in equity.
Faroe's share price fell from 161p to 148p over the 12 months to 
30 June 2012. Faroe reported a significant boost to production, oil 
and gas reserves and cash flow, together with continued exploration 
success. However, after an unsuccessful result at the company's 
first operated well in Norway, targeting the Clapton prospect, the 
share price dropped to 148p at the 30th June 2012. We remain of 
the view that Faroe has long-term upside with an ongoing drilling 
programme and a broad portfolio of exploration licences.
Outlook
The Directors of Parkmead are delighted with the significant 
progress the Group has made to date in building an exciting, 
new independent oil and gas company. With a balanced asset 
base and first production already achieved by the Group, we 
believe Parkmead has gained considerable momentum in the last 
twelve months. In addition, we are particularly encouraged by the 
substantial licence interests we were awarded, as operator, in the 
UKCS 27th Licensing Round.
Parkmead's wholly-owned subsidiary company, Aupec, continues 
to perform oil and gas industry benchmarking and petroleum 
economics for a wide range of energy companies and governments 
and the Directors believe that the Group benefits from the 
experience, technical capabilities and relationships that have been 
built up over 25 years of successful operations within Aupec.
As we look ahead into 2013 and beyond, the Group has a 
continued appetite for acquisitions and will look to add reserves 
through its active drilling programme. We believe the Group has 
created a strong platform to become a key E&P player in the 
North Sea and elsewhere in Europe. We will continue to update 
shareholders as we make further progress.
