PENTAGON PROTECTION PLC 
 
CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2008 
Introduction 
 
I present the results for the year ended 30 September 2008 to you in this statement, my first as Chairman.  
The Group has faced some challenges over the year, not least, the pressures of the economic downturn, but 
subsequent to the year end, the Board has been reconfigured and the new team intends to focus ever more 
sharply on improved strategies and operational efficiencies. 
 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank my predecessor, Alan Nicholl, for his dedication as Chairman of 
the Group for the last 3 years, and wish him well in his retirement. 
Moving on to the other changes to the Board this year; Mr Chunlin Liu, who joined the Board of Pentagon 
Protection Plc (Pentagon ) in November 2007 as Deputy Chairman, has since taken the decision to focus on 
academic pursuits and resigned in August 2008.  The Board wishes Chunlin, who continues to be a 
substantial shareholder in the Group, every success in pursuing his doctorate. 
 
More recently, we have been joined by two new directors; Mr Patric Fransko and Dr John Wyatt MBE.  Patric 
brings with him nearly ten year's experience in the window film industry and can also contribute his expert 
knowledge of the US market.  John, who has been awarded an MBE for gallantry in counter-terrorism, is a 
highly-respected authority in the area of security consultancy and is very well known in his field.  Both of our 
new directors are working with me to evolve the strategic direction of the Group and I am excited about the 
opportunities this brings.  
 
As we explained to you in the interim statement to March 2008, Pentagon has won its largest contract to 
date; a  2m turnkey contract to retro-fit glass containment window film and anchoring and replacement 
windows for an overseas government to their worldwide premises.  This project commenced in Autumn 2008 
and continues into 2009 although, unfortunately, the benefits of this contract have also been impacted by an 
extensive and costly legal battle with another party who tried to stop the Group from benefiting from this 
prestigious work.  This litigation diverted significant management effort away from the day-to-day running of 
the business and has had a detrimental effect on the results for the year.  However, this issue is now behind 
us and we can concentrate fully on maximising the benefit from this contract and our other new projects.  
 
Financial Review 
 
In the interim report to 31 March 2008, it was reported that turnover was lower than the comparable period 
last year due to a lack of sales in the Far East.  Unfortunately, this trend continued for the rest of the year 
with disappointing sales in this region.  Turnover in the Far East for the year ended September 2008 was 
just  971.  This is a drop from the year to September 2007 of  398,771 (almost 100%).  Sales to Africa and 
the Middle East also fell from  526,740 to  303,275 from 2007 to 2008 (representing a 42% reduction in 
turnover).  However, results across the rest of the world have been much more encouraging; UK turnover 
has increased by 16% from the previous period, from  606,232 in 2007 to over  700,000 this year.  The 
Group has also made exciting inroads in North America where revenue increased from no revenue in the 
region in 2007 to  95,451 in 2008. Sales within Europe have also increased by an impressive 68% from 
sales of  204,283 in 2007 to sales of  343,725 in 2008. 
The gross profit for the year of  376,621 was 54% lower than the 2007 gross profit of  818,719.  This 
results from a reduction in the gross profit margins from 47% in 2007 to 26% in 2008 reflecting the very 
difficult, competitive markets we continue to face across all sectors.  The smaller margins also result from 
performing a high proportion of much smaller contracts, where set up costs inevitably impinge on our ability 
to make good margins.

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT (CONTINUED) 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2008 
The Group continued to control other expenditure during the year; distribution costs of  256,691 have 
reduced by 28% on 2007 expenditure of  356,761.  Administrative expenses have also fallen, from 
 791,745 to  730,169, representing a drop of 8%. 
 
The Group operating loss for the year was  610,239, an increase of 85% on the 2007 loss of  329,787.  
This reflects the reduced turnover and margins arising from the current economic environment. 
 
Finance income in 2008 of  10,974 (against 2007 finance income of  10,440) is a marginal increase on last 
year and finance costs have reduced by 53% to  2,916 (2007:  6,196). 
 
Overall, the Group consolidated loss for the year was  2,991,274.  This is arrived at after an exceptional 
charge for impairment of goodwill of  2,389,093 (2007:  nil).  The impairment relates to the historic 
goodwill which arose on the acquisition of Pentagon Protection (UK) Limited (formerly Filmtek Limited).  The 
current lack of demand, which stems from the tight controls being applied to capital expenditure in our 
markets, has impacted the activity of this business unit.  The goodwill generated upon the acquisition of SDS 
Group Limited in the year remains unaffected. 
 
The Group balance sheet at the end of the period has net assets of  1,183,957 after the above impairment 
(2007:  2,912,418); this is a decrease of 59% on the previous year.  The cash position of the Group remains 
strong with cash reserves of over  500,000 (against 2007 levels of  260,904; an uplift of over 100%). 
 
Cash raised from the issue of shares amounted to  1,154,813 and this cash inflow was used to fund a new 
acquisition in the period; SDS Group Limited, which was acquired just before the year end, hence its balance 
sheet, but not its results, are included within the consolidated financial statements for the year.  I comment 
further on the operational impact of this strategic acquisition below. 
 
The Board does not recommend the payment of a dividend. 
 
Operational Review 
 
As I mention above, the operating climate has been challenging in the year to 30 September 2008.  
However, as terrorism and the ongoing issue of global warming continue to impact the thinking of the 
Group's customer base, the Group continues to be a leader in its field. 
 
Acquisition 
 
in September 2008, Pentagon acquired SDS Group Limited (SDS ).  SDS has been established for over 30 
years and is a leading supplier of security equipment and products.  SDS is also a world leader in security 
consulting and training, these services being led by Dr John Wyatt.  John is highly respected in his field and 
also widely known both in the UK and overseas; his knowledge and reputation are substantial assets to the 
wider Group.   
 
SDS supplies equipment, including highly-specialist security and search equipment, mainly to governments, 
police forces and security and defence forces in the UK and around the world. SDS has strong relationships 
with customers and extends their offering to clients by providing expert knowledge and further training and 
consultancy.  The Board and management of SDS are working together on new products, particularly in 
order to penetrate the private sector in the hotel and leisure industry. 
 
The success of this acquisition supports plans for continued expansion of the Group's activities in the 
security industry, which is affected less by the world economic downturn than many sectors.

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT (CONTINUED) 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2008 
UK Operations 
 
In this turbulent economic climate, we have continued to invest in sales and marketing.  This policy will 
ensure that the Group maintains its presence in the industry and will seek to inform the market of our 
leading services. With carbon footprints now being a priority, for example, and the reduction of CO2 
emissions being paramount, we have a golden opportunity to introduce our energy-saving films to a wide 
range of clients. 
 
The Group launched a speculative new venture in the year to supply glazing to the commercial retail sector 
including shopfronts, curtain walling, balustrade glazing, and mirrors as well as emergency glazing.  During 
the year, approximately  25,000 of set-up costs were incurred.  However, this venture was started prior to 
the collapse of the UK economy in Autumn 2008, before the virtual freeze on capital expenditure and, 
subsequent to the year-end, investment into this venture has been discontinued. 
 
USA Operations 
 
Taking on the role of Chairman has allowed me to further strengthen links between the UK Group and 
Pentagon USA given my strong involvement with operations in the States.  I bring detailed knowledge of the 
American market and am excited about the potential in this area. 
 
Middle Eastern Operations 
 
The Middle East still continues to be an area of growth in the supply of security products and blast mitigation 
products continue to be at the forefront of this revenue stream.  Our agents in Algiers and Saudi Arabia have 
obtained enquiries of over  1 million to date, in addition to a healthy order book. 
 
Rest of World 
 
In my introduction, I explain that Pentagon's largest contract to date commenced in Autumn 2008; this 
contract continues to go well and Pentagon will see the benefits over the coming years.  On our other 
projects, blast mitigation film and anchoring remains high on the list for the protection of staff and 
equipment within all buildings.  
 
The overseas government I referred to above has also confirmed that Pentagon is now one of their 
approved contractors for the implementation of security Assessment and Examination consultancy works 
globally, and this contract will run for 3 years with a potential value of approximately  500,000 per year. 
 
We also continue to tender for other substantial contracts in Europe. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Despite the challenging trading conditions, the Group remains in a strong position to emerge from the 
economic downturn leaner and more efficient, with a focus on technologies and expertise valued by our 
customers.  On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of the employees for their continued hard work 
and commitment.
