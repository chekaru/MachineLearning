 4 Annual Report & Accounts 2002
This is the first annual report for the Company since it was formed
and inherited the media software business that was demerged from
Pilat Technologies International Limited and commenced trading
independently on both the London Alternative Investment Market
(AIM) and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in February 2002, when it
also successfully raised  3.5m in what were difficult capital markets.
Despite the continued difficult market conditions, 2002 was a year
of considerable expansion of the Company's client base, leading
to a 20% increase in revenues compared with 2001. It was also 
a year of further organisational and product development, which
through tight cost control and hard work of our 90-strong team,
we have managed to deliver at significantly reduced operational
costs. As a result we are proud to report a significant increase 
in gross profit to  4,565,000 from  2,751,000 in 2001 and also
earnings for the year compared to losses for prior years.
Five new IBMS contracts were signed during the year. Four were
reported in previous quarters - with Discovery Communications, Inc.
(international implementation across their European, Asian and 
Latin American regions), Flextech Television Limited (UK), National
Geographic Channels International (USA) and Southern Cross
Broadcasting (Australia) Limited. The fifth new contract, signed in
the fourth quarter of the year, was with Playboy Enterprises, Inc.
based in Los Angeles, USA. Playboy will be using IBMS for the
management of their content and channel scheduling, replacing
several separate legacy systems. This is Pilat Media's sixth
contract with a North American based broadcaster. To develop
further our business in North America we have recently opened 
a US sales and support office, situated in Denver, Colorado, with 
its first three employees already recruited.
Pilat Media's client base includes over 20 broadcasters spread over
Europe, Middle East, Australasia and the USA. These range from
small to large and represent a different mix of functional needs
and transmission platforms and technologies, manifesting IBMS
breadth and depth as one of the world's most comprehensive
and integrated solutions of its kind, now including the new
advertising sales functionality developed in partnership with
Network Ten, Australia over the last two years. Discovery and
Southern Cross have followed Network Ten in adopting the 
enhanced IBMS to handle both their programming and
commercials. This demonstrates that IBMS is becoming a natural
candidate for many other broadcasters seeking to integrate
departments across their entire business to achieve operational
efficiencies not possible with diverse legacy systems. 
Indeed, our pipeline of potential contracts for which Pilat Media is
being considered through formal tender processes remains healthy, 
with a cumulative upfront value in the region of  20 million of
licence and implementation fees. While the mix has changed
principally through some won and lost opportunities as well as new
tenders, the value of the pipeline remains broadly unchanged and
we are optimistic about the future. However, it is worth re-iterating
the note of caution we sounded in June, that whilst we hope to 
win a fair share of these opportunities, it is a highly competitive
environment and both the award and timing of contracts cannot be
predicted with any certainty.
Q4 was our highest revenue quarter to date and was significantly
profitable. This was a result, in part, of installations at National
Geographic and Southern Cross that were completed in the 4th
quarter, a quick and successful installation for Playboy and the
on-going Discovery  One Discovery' project, which is progressing
satisfactorily and generating further revenue opportunities, and
continues to be a major contributor to revenues. We were also able
to benefit from the steady maintenance revenues, which grow as the
client base grows, and the incremental high-margin licence fees
occasionally paid when existing clients seek licence extensions to
accommodate their growing business beyond what was originally
contracted and paid for.

Results
Q4 revenues of  2,756,000 (Q4 2001:  1,780,000) were in line with
management's expectations as were the cumulative figures for the
year:  7,347,000 (2001:  6,139,000).  
Revenues from licences recognised during the quarter include the
licences from the implementations completed at Southern Cross,
National Geographic and Playboy as well as a proportion of the
Discovery licences (where contract
accounting applies according to the
percentage of project completion).
In addition, one of the other existing
customers extended its IBMS licence
to cover additional television channels.
Licence fees in Q4 totalled  1,239,000.
Licence fees recognised in the year 
were  2,456,000, representing 33.4% 
of the total revenues, a rise of  449,000 
(22%) in comparison to last year.
Additional revenues of  1,244,000
were earned during Q4 from services
including implementation, consulting,
customisation and system integration,
mostly derived from the newer clients Flextech, Discovery and SBS,
and the already live clients five and Network Ten. This component of
the revenues for the whole year was  3,983,000 representing 54.2%
of the 2002 annual revenues. The balance of revenues comes from
recurring support and maintenance fees, which totalled  908,000
(12.4% of 2002 revenues) from clients already live, post
implementation. Recurring maintenance and support fees in Q4
from existing clients totalled  273,000.
The Company generates the majority of its revenues from new IBMS
implementations each year and therefore only a longer-term (i.e.
annual) view of revenues can provide a reliable basis for
analysis and comparison. Prior year quarterly comparisons could
prove misleading as in most cases the timing of recognition of
licence fees depends upon the date of clients' formal acceptance of
the system. 
Gross profit in Q4 rose to  1,955,000 (Q4 2001:  1,283,000), which
represents a margin of 71% compared to 72% in Q4 2001. Gross
profit in this quarter benefited from the licence fees mentioned
above which were recognised in the quarter.
The Company continued to invest in enhancing the IBMS software
in response to requests from its existing customers and market
demands. The Company spent  177,000 on research and
I am pleased to report that the Company has
achieved a considerable 20% growth in
revenues for 2002 and generated earnings. 
This has been achieved against a background of difficult
markets in general, in particular in the broadcast industry, and
we are happy with the substantial progress we have made.

development in Q4 (Q4 2001:  777,000), which is less than in
previous quarters as the initial development of the new advertising
sales modules is drawing to an end and is being replaced with
chargeable client-specific work.
Selling and marketing costs in the three months to and year ended 
31 December 2002 show an increase over the previous year as 
the Company has continued to devote greater efforts in this area.
General and administrative costs were similar to previous quarters
but were higher than last year as the Company created the
infrastructure required as a separate public company. 
The profit before tax for Q4 was  1,018,000, being in line with
management's expectations, compared with a loss of  211,000 for
the equivalent period last year. There is a loss for the year before tax
of  236,000 (2001: a loss of  2,235,000), however the Company has
made a claim under the Inland Revenue's Research and Development
tax credit scheme for the years 2000 and 2001 and has received a
payment of  303,000 after 31 December 2002. This has resulted in
a profit after tax of  37,000 (2001:  1,978,000 loss).
Balance sheet
The Company's current assets substantially increased as a result of
the fund-raising and sales activity ( 4.8 million in December 2002,
compared to  2.5m in December 2001). The cash position at the
end of the year is  1.5 million. Current liabilities decreased from
 6.0 million in December 2001 to  2.4 million in December 2002,
principally because of the assignment of loans to PMG from Pilat
Technologies International Limited totalling  3.1 million as part of
the demerger process. Following the fundraising in February 2002
and current trading, the Directors are confident that PMG has
sufficient funds to carry out its operations for the foreseeable future.
Current trading and prospects
It is very gratifying to be able to report annual results which are
close to breakeven in the first year of independent operation,
despite the difficult market conditions and whilst the investments in
the product and the organisation remain substantial. This reflects
both the quality of our software as well as the dedication and skill of
our employees. We have demonstrated again our ability to reach
and satisfy different clients around the world and, with a healthy
pipeline of prospects, we remain optimistic about 2003.
