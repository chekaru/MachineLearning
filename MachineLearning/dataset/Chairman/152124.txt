 Pilat Media Global Plc / Annual Report 2012 4
The Group continues to add new clients 
while preserving the existing client base.  
As in previous years two contracts were 
signed with new clients, as well as five 
license renewal contracts demonstrating 
a high degree of client loyalty.  These 
include a new strategic client which is a 
leading global media and entertainment 
group where IBMS will serve as the 
central rights management, content 
scheduling and media trafficking system 
for all their linear channels and on 
demand new media services across 
Europe, Middle East and Africa.  It will 
replace several disperse systems, and 
will deliver new efficiencies through 
centralisation, standardisation and 
workflow automation.  As the client is 
also implementing the Group's MediaPro 
advertising sales software provided by 
Pilat Media BV, this major contract win 
also demonstrates the synergies across 
Pilat Media's IBMS and the MediaPro 
businesses.  
A record number of over twenty 
implementation and post go live 
upgrades and expansion projects were 
undertaken during the year, generating 
revenues for 2012 and leaving a healthy 
pipeline for 2013.  As a result of this 
additional work and the likely signing of 
new contracts the Group has continued 
to grow its development capacity.  
Following the trend that was reported last 
year, these projects include a growing 
number of TV Everywhere (TVE ) 
related initiatives with clients looking 
to utilise IBMS to serve as the central 
content management system supporting 
their multi-screen multi-platform strategy 
from rights management, meta-data 
management, linear and non-linear 
scheduling and media workflow 
orchestration perspectives.  
In 2012 Pilat Media continued to direct 
a high proportion of its research and 
development (R&D) efforts at further 
enhancing IBMS' capabilities for TVE 
related purposes.  Going a step further, 
the Group also launched OTTilus in 
mid-2012 to focus on and dedicate 
to OTT (Over The Top ) solutions for 
existing and new clients.  OTTilus is 
developing and starting to market an 
end-to-end platform that can deliver 
streaming, catch-up and VOD (Video 
On Demand ) services through the 
Internet to the viewer, whether on a PC, 
a tablet, an internet connected television 
or a Smartphone.  It can work in 
conjunction with IBMS or independently.  
OTTilus started as a joint venture with 
a specialised partner so that Pilat 
Media could leverage proven existing 
technology and expertise. However, upon 
completion and delivery of the first phase 
of the platform, which was developed 
for OTTilus by the partner according 
to our specifications the Pilat Media 
has acquired the partner's stake and 
transferred the lead engineers to OTTilus.  
The Group should achieve simplified 
management and accelerate progression 
of the new initiative with 100% control 
going forward.  
Clients' feedback on the new platform 
is encouraging and the Group hopes 
to achieve OTTilus' first sales later in 
2013.  At the year end, as Pilat Media 
had not received the final enhanced 
OTT platform, the  250,000 initial 
payment it had made in respect of the 
platform, is shown in the balance sheet 
as a prepayment together with a small 
amount of development costs spent in 
the second half of the year.  In future 
reports, now that the Group has received 
and tested the delivered software, 
these investments and the subsequent 
payments to the partner will be shown as 
additions to intangible assets.  
Chairman's and Chief Executive Officer's Statement 2012
Pilat Media is pleased to report its results for the year 
ended 31 December 2012.  This has been another year 
of improvements in all the key metrics.  Revenues grew 
by 4.2% to their highest ever level of  23.5 million and 
cash balances, net of loans, increased by  4 million to 
 10.7 million.   www.pilatmedia.com 5
The Board believes that the opportunities 
that the OTT market presents for Pilat 
Media are very exciting. Whilst it is 
already a very competitive market, 
the Group has a number of unique 
advantages over other entrants, given 
Pilat Media's 14 years of broadcast 
experience and the complementary 
role IBMS can play both on the content 
distribution and the advertising selling 
and insertion fronts.  
Revenues
The revenues in Q4 2012 were the 
highest ever quarterly revenues for the 
Group at  7.7million (Q4 2011:  6.2 
million) and this resulted in an increase 
in annual revenues for 2012 by 4.2% 
to  23.5 million, again the highest level 
ever.
There was a substantial increase in 
license fees in 2012, increasing by 50% 
to  4.5 million (2011:  3.0 million).  In 
2012 license fees represented 19.2% 
of total revenues (2011:  2.8 million, 
13.4% of revenues).  In addition to the 
license fees recognised for ongoing 
implementation projects, a number of 
existing broadcasters paid additional 
license fees for license renewal and 
extensions as well as for licensing 
additional modules, such as the relatively 
new IBMS-Rights module.  
Revenues for recurring support and 
maintenance services decreased slightly 
to  5.5 million (the same level as 2010) 
as a result of the loss of the maintenance 
revenue from the Fox Television Stations 
contract terminated in 2011.  Support 
and maintenance revenues are expected 
to increase to 2011 levels and higher in 
future years as implementation projects 
come to completion and broadcasters 
take more channels and services live.  
Revenues resulting from professional 
services, which cover project 
management, requirement analysis, 
customisation, integration, data 
migration, training and general customer 
support, continued to be as strong as 
last year and altogether amounted to 
 13.5 million, representing 57% of 2012 
revenues (2011:  13.7 million, 61% of 
revenues).  
In respect of the large and long-term 
implementation contracts, revenue on 
license fees and professional services 
are recognised progressively according 
to the project's stage of completion, as in 
previous years.  As the Group completed 
a number of implementation projects in 
2011 and 2012 the revenue contribution 
of these projects decreased in 2012 to 
26% of revenue (2011: 49.5%).
In 2012 there was a reduced reliance on 
the Group's largest three clients.  These 
top three clients contributed 25.5% of 
the total 2012 revenues (32% in 2011).  
The North and South American clients 
contributed 40% of total revenues in 
2012 (2011: 46%), the European and 
African clients contributed 37% (2011: 
30%) and the Australasian clients 
contributed 23% (2011: 24%).
Research and development
Pilat Media continues to invest in 
improvements to the IBMS software to 
ensure it remains relevant and attractive 
to existing and new clients. In 2012 
the Board increased the resources 
allocated to R&D by 25% to  3.7 
million (2011:  2.9 million) due to the 
continued investment in new modules 
and features and a higher proportion of 
enhancements commissioned by clients 
that were of a generic nature.  R&D 
efforts focused on making IBMS better 
equipped to support multi-platform TV 
and TV Everywhere/Anytime initiatives by  Pilat Media Global Plc / Annual Report 2012 6
further enhancing the Advanced Rights 
Module (adding customer-defined, 
multilevel rights management to support 
multiplatform media environments), 
developing a version of IBMS that can be 
deployed in a cloud infrastructure and 
the creation of IBMSExpress which can 
be deployed in just a few weeks.  
Profitability
Gross profit increased to 52.4% of 
revenues (2011: 51.1%) as a result of 
the increase in license fees from contract 
renewals. During the year additional 
analytical and development staff were 
recruited in response to an increase 
in demand from the existing client 
base and in preparation for additional 
growth anticipated in 2013.  However, 
thanks to restructuring and cost savings 
initiatives taken in late 2011, general and 
administrative costs were reduced.  
Operating profit before impairment 
of receivables and amortisation of 
intangible assets in 2012 was  2.8 
million representing 12.1% of revenues, 
compared with  2.4 million or 10.7% in 
2011.  Finance income increased due to 
the higher cash balances whilst finance 
costs were higher due to the interest 
charges on the foreign currency loans.  
The effective rate of tax in 2012 is 
25.8% (2011: 11.7%), approximately 
the standard rate of corporate tax rate in 
the UK.  The 2011 charge was lower due 
to the overseas tax charges being offset 
by research and development tax claims 
made in the UK relating to earlier years, 
together with other adjustments to prior 
year tax charges.
Statement of Financial Position
The Group achieved a significant 
reduction in trade and other receivables, 
to  10.2 million at the end of 2012 
compared with  11.3 million at the 
end of 2011, primarily as a number of 
implementation projects were completed 
during the year and the final milestone 
payments were invoiced and received.  
As a result of collections during the year, 
cash balances increased to  14.9 million 
from  12.4 million at 31 December 
2011.  This balance includes the sterling 
value of the currency loans designed to 
minimise currency fluctuations.  During 
the year the Group repaid  1.6 million of 
these currency loans and the balance of 
the loans at 31 December 2012 reduced 
to  4.2 million (2011:  5.8 million).  The 
currency loans are repayable on demand 
but are not due for repayment in full until 
31 December 2013.
Cash flow
As noted above, the Group generated  4 
million of cash (2011:  3 million), and 
achieved a significant increase in cash 
balances to  14.9 million (2011:  12.4 
million) whilst reducing the currency loan 
balance.  The cash balance net of loans 
increased at the end of 2012 to  10.7 
million (2011:  6.65 million) as a result 
of collections of receivables, the profit 
generated in the year and  0.5 million 
received from the conversion of share 
options into shares.
