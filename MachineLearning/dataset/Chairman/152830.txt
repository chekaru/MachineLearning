CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
PIPEXPERTISE
OVERVIEW
I am pleased to report another record year 
for PIPEX with strong organic growth in 
broadband and hosting services supported 
by accretive acquisitions in both these areas. 
Revenues increased by 30% to  133 million 
(FY 2004:  102 million) and adjusted EBITDA 
(pre-integration and UITF 17 and 25 charges) 
increased to  17.0 million (FY 2004: 
 13.7 million). Free cash fl ow generated 
in the year was  7.9 million compared to 
 1.3 million in 2004.
PIPEX's focus is on selling multiple 
products to its new customers, particularly 
those subscribing initially for broadband. 
High demand for broadband provides 
the opportunity to deliver a range of 
complementary services (particularly voice 
and line rental) to both our residential and 
business customers. The post year end 
acquisition of Homecall gives the group 
scale and additional capability in this 
fundamentally important area.
The acquisition of Donhost in April 2005 
strengthened our position as the UK's largest 
dedicated and shared hosting and domain 
names business. Donhost was particularly 
successful in the reseller market, skills which 
have been added to PIPEX's Web Fusion 
and 123Reg brands.
On 17 October 2005 we acquired Freedom 
to Surf for a cash consideration of  10 million. 
Freedom to Surf was a UK ADSL business 
with in excess of 40,000 customers, 
consolidating PIPEX's position in this market 
as the fifth largest broadband provider. 
The increased customer density from the 
acquisition enabled the company to expand 
its LLU target to 100 exchanges.
SUMMARY
  Acquisition of Donhost in April 2005 
strengthens position as the UK's 
largest dedicated and shared hosting 
and domain names business.
  Around 50% of all new PIPEX Internet 
broadband subscribers also sign up to 
take voice services.
  Acquisition of Homecall takes PIPEX 
to over one million customers.
  The fi rst migration of customers onto 
our unbundled exchanges will start in 
April 2006.
  Creation of wireless broadband 
company with Intel.

BROADBAND SERVICES
We ended the year with 283,000 customers 
up 47%, from 192,000 at the end of 2004. 
Average revenue per customer reduced in 
the year from  25 to  23, in line with market 
pricing. Business customers continue to 
comprise 20% of the total.
Following a successful trial, around 50% 
of all new PIPEX Internet broadband 
subscribers also sign-up to take voice 
services. From the second quarter these 
customers will also be offered line rental 
in our bundle of services, thereby removing 
their billing relationship with BT. We believe 
that the sale of these bundled services will 
increase average revenues per customer over 
the year and help protect margins. We also 
know that the average life of a customer 
is extended by 44 months for a customer 
who takes all three services (broadband, 
voice and line rental) compared to a single 
service voice customer.
HOSTING SERVICES
The division enjoyed good organic growth 
in the year and benefi ted from the acquisition 
of Donhost to close with 290,000 hosting 
and 1.3 million domain name customers 
up from 154,000 and 935,000 respectively 
at the end of 2004. 
During the year we closed three UK data 
centres to focus our resources on our three 
remaining, world class, UK facilities. The 
closure costs are included within integration 
costs shown on the face of the 2005 profi t 
and loss account. In Germany, strong organic 
growth was maintained throughout 2005 
requiring us to secure a second data centre 
in Cologne.
NETWORK SERVICES
We continue to believe that the increase 
in broadband penetration in the UK will drive 
the demand for more complex access, 
hosting and security products amongst 
corporate customers; a trend which is 
evident from the behaviour of many of 
our network services customers. 
This division also provides infrastructure 
and network management for the rest of 
the business, with all of the company's 
key technical sites sitting on a common 
backbone. During 2005 the division took 
on responsibility for the implementation 
of PIPEX's LLU roll out.
OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
Turnover increased in the year by 30% to 
 133 million, with just  4 million coming from 
2005 acquisitions (compared to  24 million 
from acquisitions in 2004). Gross profit 
increased to  61.2 million, from  48.5 million 
in 2004; the slight gross margin decline, 
of 1.4 percentage points, being in line with 
market reductions in broadband pricing. 
Going forward, our broadband margins 
should be maintained by the sale of bundled

products (broadband, voice and line rental) 
to our customers. EBITDA, pre-integration 
and UITF 17 and 25 charges, rose to 
 17.0 million from  13.7 million in 2004. 
Free cash fl ow for the year was  7.9 million 
compared to  1.3 million in 2004.
POST PERIOD-END UPDATE
ACQUISITION OF HOMECALL
On 23 March 2006 the company announced 
the acquisition of Caudwell Communications 
Limited, trading as Homecall, for consideration 
in the form of assumed bank debt of  43 million.
Homecall is one of the UK's leading providers 
of voice, line rental and broadband services 
with over 500,000 customers, taking PIPEX 
to over one million customers in total. The 
acquisition is a major milestone towards the 
company's stated objective of selling multiple 
services to its customers in order to strengthen 
average revenues per customer and to reduce 
churn. With over 350,000 of Homecall's 
customers buying more than one service, 
the company now has 29% of its customer 
base subscribing to multiple services.
Homecall has a retail presence through 
Phones4U's 363 high street shops and has 
a strong outbound telesales function which 
complements PIPEX's existing web based 
sales channels.
Homecall is trading profi tably and is expected 
to add approximately  2 million to group 
EBITDA in 2006. It is not expected to have 
a signifi cant impact on current capital 
expenditure forecasts for the year.
CREATION OF WIRELESS 
BROADBAND COMPANY WITH INTEL
Today the company announces the 
formation, with Intel Capital, of PIPEX 
Wireless, to deliver wireless broadband 
to the UK's major metropolitan areas. Intel 
is initially investing US$25 million in the new 
company and PIPEX, which retains a majority 
interest, has transferred its 3.6GHz spectrum 
licence into the venture.
PIPEX Wireless will deploy high speed 
broadband services based on the WiMAX 
standard starting, it anticipates, in London 
and Manchester in 2007 and expanding 
to reach the top eight population centres 
by 2008.
Intel brings to the venture a strong brand 
and second-to-none industry knowledge 
and technical expertise.
FUNDING
On 19 January 2006 the company 
announced a placing of 109,000,000 ordinary 
shares at a price of 13p per share to raise 
 14.2 million, before expenses of  0.6 million. 
PIPEXCELLENT
PIPEX 05 PIPEX COMMUNICATIONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
The funds are to be used to fund future 
growth opportunities in the UK market.
On 23 March 2006 PIPEX Finance (Jersey) 
Limited announced the private placement of 
 80 million 3.875% Guaranteed Convertible 
Bonds 2011. In addition, Lehman Brothers 
(International) Europe was granted the option 
to increase the size by an additional  20 million. 
At the time of this announcement, 
subscriptions for  80 million of the bonds 
have been received. The bonds represent 
senior unsecured debt subordinated, up to 
a limit of  60 million, to future senior secured 
debt. The bonds are convertible into ordinary 
shares of the company at a conversion price 
of 19p. The company has an option to call 
the bonds after three years, should the price 
of the company's ordinary shares exceed 
130% of the conversion price over a 
certain period.
The proceeds of the issue were used to 
repay a  40 million bridging loan, obtained to 
fund the purchase of Homecall, and to repay 
all of PIPEX's existing bank debt, amounting 
to  35.2 million when repaid.
It is intended that an application will be 
made for the bonds to be listed on the 
Professional Securities Market (PSM) of 
the London Stock Exchange.
OUTLOOK
The fi rst migration of customers onto our 
unbundled exchanges will start in April 2006. 
As we have previously indicated, the group' s 
current intention is to unbundle 100 exchanges 
where we have suffi cient existing customers 
to ensure payback within two years. Homecall' s 
broadband customer base would allow us to 
extend our LLU programme whilst maintaining 
our strict payback criterion.
The group has traded well in the fi rst quarter 
of 2006 and the addition of Homecall has 
strengthened our service portfolio. With an 
increasing number of our customers buying 
multiple services, we are protecting margins 
and reducing customer churn. These factors 
lead us to believe that PIPEX should enjoy 
strong growth across its consumer and 
SME businesses.
We look forward to working with Intel, who we 
believe is an ideal partner for PIPEX, to roll out 
new wireless broadband services across the UK.
