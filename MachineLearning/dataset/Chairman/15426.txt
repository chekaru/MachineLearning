We have advanced  a number of key projects with 
production from new wells in Hungary, sizeable new 
prospects identified from new 3-D seismic in both 
Slovenia and Hungary, and of course the recent sale 
of our Swiss subsidiary for  8 million post period end.  
The fact that we were able to obtain such a strong price 
for our Swiss subsidiary, while retaining the opportunity 
to participate in any conventional development in 
the Swiss permits, illustrates the inherent value 
in our portfolio of multiple oil and gas production, 
exploration and appraisal assets across Europe.  
Our established strategy of participating in low-cost 
onshore assets with high upside potential gives us 
a degree of flexibility and mobility that has proved 
invaluable given the recent market uncertainty.  Indeed, 
the diversity of our portfolio has become one of our key 
strengths in such a volatile market and has allowed 
us to schedule a very active technical programme for 
2010.  This programme is intended to enhance our 
asset base by increasing reserves and generating 
additional production volumes and revenues.
During the year we continued gas production from the 
Pen szlek area of the Ny rs g permits in Hungary.  We 
also announced additional discoveries that will provide 
a valuable revenue stream in the coming years that will 
enable us to pursue a number of larger opportunities 
across our portfolio. The Pen szlek project, although 
small in size, demonstrates our ability to accomplish 
the full cycle of the exploration and production process, 
from the preliminary geological analysis and the 
acquisition of seismic, through to the drilling and 
construction of facilities and in due course, to gas sales.  
Slovenia and Hungary remain the core focus for 2010 in 
particular the Peti ovci-Lov szi project which covers an 
area of 178 square kilometres, about 90 km
2
 in either 
country.  120 km
2
 of 3-D seismic data has already been 
acquired and the interpretation of this seismic data 
has revealed a number of new drilling targets mapped 
outside the area of the core deep gas field.  In addition 
to the substantial deep gas reserves, independently 
estimated at greater than 300bcf only on the Slovenian 
part of the project, our estimates for these newly 
identified prospects show a combined potential of over 
75 Bcf of additional recoverable gas and it is likely that 
successful drilling of some of these prospects could 
lead to further follow-on targets. Slovenia, like Hungary, 
has a strong demand  for domestic gas production 
and with this in mind, planning is now underway for a 
number of wells to be drilled both in 2010 and in 2011 
and discussions are on-going with project partners 
to prioritise the drilling of identified prospects.    
Acquisition of a further 65 km
2
 of 3-D seismic 
in the adjacent Lov szi field area across the 
Hungarian border has been completed and an 
initial two exploration wells in this area are planned 
and possible locations have been identified.
In Italy's Latina Valley our project partners 
agree that the results of the Fontana-1 well 
are sufficiently encouraging to proceed with 
the permitting of a hydrocarbon appraisal well, 
Anagni-2, located within 1 km of the Fontana-1 
location, targeting an adjacent structure.  
As previously referenced, in April, Ascent sold its 
100% owned Swiss subsidiary, PEOS AG, to eCORP 
Europe International Ltd., for a cash consideration of 
 8 million along with various participation options.  
We believe this was an outstanding transaction, 
having retained, without obligation, the opportunity 
to participate in the development of fields within the 
permits whilst simultaneously realising  8 million 
from our investment in the Swiss assets.  We expect 
that the drilling of the Hermrigen-2 appraisal well will 
commence later this year.  Our estimates of reserves 
is 150 Bcf in the Muschelkalk and Bunter layers of 
the Hermrigen prospect and Ascent has the right to a 
45% interest in the development of these reserves by 
choosing to pay 45% of the well cost after discovery.
With a portfolio of European assets and a 
technical team with in-depth experience both 
operationally and corporately, we believe we 
have a structure that can be utilised to generate 
substantial additional shareholder value.  
Outlook for 2010
I believe that the Company has never been in a 
stronger position to move forward.  We have a 
diverse portfolio of assets with a healthy balance 
of development, appraisal and exploration projects.  
We have a significant amount of work scheduled 
across the portfolio for 2010 with our priority 
being the Peti ovci / Lov szi project in Slovenia 
and Hungary.  We believe this to be a potentially 
sizable onshore European project and we look 
forward to accelerating the development of this 
exciting opportunity in the coming period.
Finally I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
everyone involved in the Company for their continued 
hard work and the part they have all played in 
moving Ascent further towards achieving its goals 
this year.  We continue to place significant belief in 
the value of our assets to generate genuine returns 
to shareholders and I look forward to updating you 
with further developments, during what I believe, 
will be a year of great activity for the Company.
