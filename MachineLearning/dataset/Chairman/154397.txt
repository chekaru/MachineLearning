continued
Khakanja was one of our assets where the mine plans were 
amended mid-year in response to the significant decline in gold 
and silver prices. The change was made against the backdrop 
of a scheduled decline in grades at the main Khakanja deposit. 
Nevertheless, our total production target for the hub remained 
intact and the cost performance was better than expected due 
to increased recoveries and an increased share of high-grade 
ore from Ozerny and Avlayakan compared to the previous year.
2013 highlights
Mining
Mining at Yurievskoye was completed in the beginning  
of 2013. At the Khakanja open-pit mine, the pushback  
at pit 1 continued, which limited the amounts of ore mined 
(down 78% on 2012). Average gold and silver grades in ore 
mined decreased by 42% and 28%, compared to 2012  
when ore was mainly sourced from pit 3 and Yurievskoye.  
Ore mining is expected to be resumed in Q2 2014. As a result 
of additional studies, the commencement of underground 
mining at Khakanja has been postponed indefinitely due  
to geotechnical concerns, with the corresponding reserve 
being reclassified as resource. The resulting reduction in 
life-of-mine is expected to be compensated for by reserve 
additions at Ozerny, which are based on the results  
of ongoing step-out drilling.
At Avlayakan, open-pit mining ceased in November,  
one year earlier than originally planned, and underground 
development (919 m in 2013) commenced ahead of the original 
schedule as a result of decisions made following the strategic 
review. 78 Kt of Avlayakan ore were safely shipped by sea 
during the 2013 navigation season, compared to 41 Kt in 2012. 
The average grades in ore mined (8.7 g/t gold and 116 g/t 
silver in 2013) are expected to increase following the ramp-up 
of the Avlayakan underground mine and the beginning  
of stoping in 2014.
At Ozerny, mining works achieved full scale in 2013: stripping 
volumes increased to 4.7 Mt, more than 10 times over; ore 
mined increased more than five times over to 319 Kt, with 
average grades of 3.6 g/t gold and 40 g/t silver. 139 Kt  
were trucked to the Khakanja plant by winter road and were 
processed in 2013. A further increase in volumes of ore mined 
and trucked in 2014 is expected and will support the grade 
profile and production levels of the hub as a whole.
Processing
Gold production for the full year increased by 14% while  
silver production decreased by 44% as a result of a structural 
change in the plant's feedstock year-on-year. Processing  
of high silver grade ore from Khakanja's pit 3 was substituted 
by ore from Ozerny and Avlayakan.

 2014 pRioRities
Sustaining the grade profile and extending the life-of-mine 
remain our top priorities for Khakanja in 2014. In the year 
ahead, the development of the underground mine at 
Avlayakan and increasing the volume of ore shipping  
by sea, as well as further growth of mining volumes  
at Ozerny, will be the key contributors to support the 
volume and grade of ore processed at the Khakanja plant.

Operating review
continued
Voro continues to be one of the most profitable and effective 
mines in our portfolio. This is achieved by a combination  
of an attractive location in the Urals region, with full access  
to cheap power and infrastructure, and solid operating 
performance. Despite a significant decline in the gold price 
during the year, Voro delivered a resounding 61% adjusted 
EBITDA margin for 2013.
2013 highlights
Mining
The open-pit mine at Voro demonstrated a strong performance 
throughout the year. Mining in Q1 traditionally focused on primary 
ore, with a solid improvement in average grade mined allowing 
us to increase the average grade processed to 6.0 g/t. With  
the reduction of the stripping ratio in Q2, ore mined increased 
by 76% quarter-on-quarter, mainly represented by oxidised ore 
from the Southern pit to be used in heap leaching. In Q3 works 
continued at a stable pace across the Central and Southern 
pits. The amount of oxidised ore mined nearly doubled 
quarter-on-quarter, in order to supply material for the seasonal 
heap leaching. The amount of ore mined (both primary and 
oxidised) in Q4 was up 6% year-on-year. 
Total ore mined was 1.79 Mt, 6% up on 2012, with the increase 
split proportionally between primary and oxidised ore. Average 
gold grades in primary ore were stable at 5.7 g/t while average 
grades in oxidised ore decreased by 11%, fully in accordance 
with the mine plan. Mining works were concentrated on the 
Central (primary ore) and Southern (oxidised ore) pits.
Processing
In the first half of the year, Voro used third-party sources  
of ore from nearby deposits in order to leverage its processing 
capacity. This caused a temporary increase in the cash costs 
of the operation. Following the decline in the gold price in the 
second quarter, purchases of third-party ore were discontinued 
resulting in total cash cost improvement in the second half  
of the year.
Gold production at Voro in 2013 decreased marginally by  
1% year-on-year and comprised 154 Koz, of which 15% is 
produced at the heap leaching circuit and the remaining 85%  
at the CIP circuit. The modest grade and throughput decline  
at the heap leaching circuit was fully offset by a 7% increase  
in average grade and continued improvements in throughput 
(+1%) at the CIP circuit.
Ongoing improvement process
In 2013, the Carbon-in-Column (CIC) process was  
introduced for the extraction of gold from heap leach  
solutions as changing ore chemistry slowed down  
recoveries at the historical Merrill-Crowe circuit.

 2014 pRioRities
The Voro mine was one of Polymetal's original acquisitions 
in 1998 and although it remains one of our lowest cost and 
highest margin assets, we remain committed to searching 
for new methods of enhancing both its efficiency  
and profitability.
Efforts are under way to identify additional sources  
of primary and oxidised ore, including third-party supplies.
At the Voro mine, the start of mining at the Gorevaya zone 
of South Voro is expected in 2014.
