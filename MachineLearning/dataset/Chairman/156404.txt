2013 was an operationally critical and ultimately
successful period for President, largely focused
on Paraguay. Since the 2012 farm-ins to the Pirity
and Demattei concessions in Paraguay, President
has completed an extensive seismic campaign to
evaluate the basin potential and define high
graded drilling prospects. Preparation of drilling
sites commenced at the end of 2013, and we are
now at the point of commencing the 2014 drilling
campaign. Argentina and Louisiana continue to
provide a core foundation of reserves and
production for the Company, with the potential
for further production growth, particularly
in Argentina.
The Paraguayan concessions combine to cover a north of President's existing Paraguayan
