Chairman's  
Statement
Summary
The overriding theme in 2011 was to move from 
an exploration led model to a production focused 
company, with exploration and appraisal upside.  
This has been successfully achieved through our 
major new acquisition in Argentina, which sets 
President on a path to material production growth 
and a foundation on which to build a larger presence.
Argentina
In June, the Company announced the acquisition 
of a 50% working interest in the Puesto Guardian 
Concession (the Concession) in the Noroeste basin 
in northern Argentina. The acquisition cost US$2.2 
per 2P barrel and provided existing production, 
immediate development opportunities and further 
reserve exploitation potential. 
The drilling of President's first two wells in Argentina, 
PEE-1001 at the Pozo Escondido Field and DP-1001 at 
the Dos Puntitas field, have now been completed in H1 
2012. PEE-1001 successfully encountered a 32 metre 
gross oil column at a depth of some 3,420 metres, 
predominantly in carbonates, which currently 
produces in an offset well. Based on logs and data 
from the offset well, President estimates that there is 
28 metres of net pay. The second well DP-1001 was 
also a successful well, encountering 33 metres of net 
pay in both sandstone and carbonate.
Well DP-1001 has been brought on stream as a producer 
at 300 bopd gross, with production contribution from 
just the carbonate interval. Once a frac campaign 
has been completed, it is expected that this well will 
also produce commingled with the A6 sands, which 
President believes will flow at similar rates to the 
carbonate. These rates suggest that pre drill estimates of 
380 bopd (post frac) can be exceeded on this and other 
wells. The free flow from the carbonate also provides 
affirmation of the potential from this reservoir across 
the Concession, where President has preliminarily 
identified additional oil in place across three fields.
Petrophysical review of many old wells drilled some 
30 years ago on the Concession has provided President 
with encouragement for additional reserve upside in 
the area. The review to date of three of the five fields 
on the Concession have yielded internally estimated 
scoping numbers of additional 66 million barrels of oil 
in place which were not considered in any previous 
reserves estimates. Even applying prudent recovery 
factors to these estimates could have the effect of 
materially increasing President's reserves. Similar 
petrophysical studies will be carried out this year for 
other existing fields on the licence, and indeed on 
other areas within the Concession boundaries.
A fraccing programme for a number of old shut-in 
wells is planned for 2012. President believes that this 
work could generate meaningful production in wells 
which had been previously shut in. In parallel with 
the drilling of new wells and the fraccing programme 
at Puesto Guardian, President with its partner are 
expediting a work-over programme on shut-in 
production wells which will include testing electric 
submersible pumps for the first time. If successful, 
a number of shut-in wells would be switched from 
beam pumps to electrical pumps. This programme, 
together with the additional work-over activity on 
shut-in production wells, which have suffered through 
lack of capital expenditure, is expected to increase and 
thereafter maintain production from these wells.
Gaffney Cline & Associates were commissioned to 
report on the exploration potential of the Martinez del 
Tineo prospect at the Puesto Guardian field. Gaffney 
Cline have estimated unrisked gross prospective 
resources of 570 bcf of natural gas and 14.5 million 
barrels of condensate. Although this prospect is at this 
stage an exploration target it is possibly a play opener 
and does point to the potential of the Concession in 
addition to the current reserve profile.
President approaches this work with some confidence 
in the near-term potential of uplifting production and 
the scope to materially increase President's reserves at 
Puesto Guardian during 2012.
Net production in Argentina averaged 183 bopd for 
the six months July through December. Realised oil 
prices increased steadily during the second half from 
approximately US$60/barrel to US$70 per barrel 
(due to government relaxation of controls), and 
resulted in revenue of US$2.2 million. Drilling and 
work-over activity in 2012 are expected to generate 
materially higher daily production.

US Operations
While smaller scale work-overs were performed in 
the first half of the year, new wells and recompletions 
commenced mid-year which have contributed to 
higher production rates. In Louisiana, average daily 
production in the second half of 2011 was 182 boepd 
(H1: 136 barrels of oil equivalent). Full year average 
production was 160 boepd (2010: 185 boepd). At 
year end oil accounted for approximately 90% 
of production, with an annual average of 66% 
(2010: 45%). The higher oil weighting and realised 
prices resulted in a 41% increase in US revenue to 
US$4.8 million (2010: US$3.4 million). Strategically, 
the US operations have become secondary to our 
focus in Argentina but remain important as a cash 
generative asset, contributing US$3.6 million of 
operating cash flow after tax to the Group. 
President continues to assess low-risk accretive 
opportunities in Louisiana.
Australia Operations
In April, the Company announced the drilling results 
of its Northumberland 2 well on PEL 82 licence, in the 
Otway Basin, South Australia. While no commercial 
discovery was made, President has been encouraged 
by hydrocarbon fluorescence and gas shows. 
President's current licence commitments on PEL 82 
have now been satisfied and the next steps on this 
licence are being actively considered.  President Petroleum Company PLC | Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2011 04

The USA reserve reduction relates to proved undeveloped reserves at East Lake Verret. Management has taken 
the decision not to proceed with the development of wells for which 1P reserves were previously recognised as a 
consequence of the drilling result of Kafoury 3 and President's primary focus on Argentina.
Financial Summary
Revenue increased to US$7.0 million (2010: US$3.4 
million) as a result of higher oil production and 
realised prices in Louisiana and the inclusion of 
six months' revenue from Argentina. In aggregate 
cost of sales remained broadly flat at US$5.1 million 
(2010: US$5.3 million) resulting in a gross profit of 
US$2.0 million (2010: gross loss of US$1.9 million). 
Lower depreciation charges were offset by higher well 
operating costs, reflecting the fixed cost component 
of the five field Puesto Guardian Concession in 
Argentina. As material production growth is delivered 
the fixed cost component will become less significant, 
leading to improved margins on incremental barrels.
Group Overheads increased from US$2.4 million to 
US$8.0 million due to increased staff costs critical to 
the expansion of the business, the build-out of our 
Argentine business, costs associated with business 
development and costs related to restructuring. The 
key components of administrative expenses were 
staff costs of US$2.8 million, costs related to business 
development (including the Argentine acquisition) of 
US$1.6 million and share based payments of US$0.4 
million. Other administrative expenses include 
advisory fees, corporate structure costs and costs to 
establish the Argentine office in Buenos Aires.
As stated in the 2011 Interim Report, the Group has 
recognised an impairment on the unsuccessful well 
at Kafoury 3 of US$12.9 million, which together with 
other impairments has contributed to an impairment 
charge of US$15.8 million (note 13). As a result 
operating loss for the year is US$21.9 million.
Loan finance from Macquarie Bank was repaid during 
the year and the Group had no debt as at the year end.
As continued evidence of the support and conviction 
in President's strategy and prospects, Peter Levine 
(through a wholly owned subsidiary of Levine 
Capital Management Limited) has extended an up to 
US$6.5 million loan facility to President, on fair and 
reasonable terms, in order to provide the flexibility 
to maintain momentum and pursue an increasing 
number of growth opportunities.
Outlook 
President looks forward with confidence to an exciting 
2012 as the Group capitalises on the momentum 
started in the second half of 2011. This will see 
President moving towards material production 
growth and advancing its very promising position in 
Argentina. President believes that recent events in 
Argentina are unrelated to its own activities. President 
remains in a good position to take advantage of the 
opportunities for growth and will continue to work 
constructively in the country.
In February 2012 the company successfully raised 
US$9.4 million, net of expenses, in an equity raising 
from existing and new shareholders.
As previously announced, Peter Levine has been 
appointed the Executive Chairman, effective 11 May 
2012. The past 12 months have been eventful for 
President and, with the momentum we now have in 
Argentina, I trust 2012 will continue to be an exciting 
time for President and its stakeholders. Finally, I would 
like to thank our shareholders, staff, advisors and 
other stakeholders for their meaningful support and 
contribution during the year.
