Chairman's  
Statement
Summary
The year 2012 was rightly dominated by our 
acquisition, by way of farm-in, of two concessions in 
Paraguay covering some 16,000 km
2
.  The directors 
are confident that this world class exploration asset 
will provide the platform for significant growth 
in the future. Argentina and Louisiana continue 
to provide a core foundation of reserves and 
production for the Company, with the potential 
for further production growth, particularly 
in Argentina.
Paraguay
In September, we announced an agreement to farm-
in to two contiguous blocks in the Pirity sub Basin 
of Paraguay. This was a significant transaction for 
the Company in a relatively untapped region of the 
world. The transaction is a strategic fit for President, 
as the petroleum system is well known to the 
Company through its operations across the border 
in Argentina. The transaction builds critical mass in 
the region while providing entry into a new country, 
and utilises President's expanding technical and 
operational team. DeGolyer and McNaughton have 
independently assessed net mean risked recoverable 
Prospective Resources of 94 mmbbls of oil, which 
management estimates to underpin a greater than 
US$2 billion success case value to President.
We have made significant progress in Paraguay 
since the completion of the transaction six months 
ago. Seismic operations have commenced, with 
Global Geophysical Inc. (Global) contracted to 
acquire approximately 780 km
2
 of 3D and 100 km 
of 2D, with results due in Q4 2013. Global have 
demonstrated confidence in President and the 
prospect areas by agreeing a success based fee 
schedule whereby Global will deliver their full 
range of services at cost in return for President 
and its partners paying a discovery bonus to be 
paid from production over time. Considerable 
effort has been made to building up an in-country 
infrastructure, and we have now commenced 
planning for the Q2 2014 drilling programme. President Energy PLC | Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2012 03 
Argentina
Against a subdued market backdrop, the period was 
busy for President in Argentina. Three new wells 
were drilled, 3D seismic was reprocessed and our 
acreage position increased, the DP-1001 well was 
brought on-stream while the PEE-1001 well and 
DP-1002 well are part of a future frac sidetrack and 
work-over programme. Average daily production 
was stable against the previous year and oil prices 
held firm at approximately US$70 per barrel. 
We recently announced the results of a 
comprehensive independent reprocessing and 
remapping exercise of the 2006 3D seismic data on 
two of the five fields within the Puesto Guardian 
Concession. The work shows significant undrilled 
highs within the proven field areas and an increase 
in stock tank oil initially in place (STOIIP ) in the 
Pozo Escondido field of 215% from 20 mmbbls to 
63 mmbbls. These results, when combined with 
the low oil recovery to date, 1% and 11% for Pozo 
Escondido and Dos Puntitas respectively, confirm 
management's view of further development 
potential in these fields through fracs, sidetracks 
and further drilling.
After the delays caused by bad weather and 
upgrading of equipment, we also commenced 
an initial three well fraccing campaign targeting 
carbonate reservoirs in the Dos Puntitas and Pozo 
Escondido fields. If these are successful, it provides 
encouragement for a further sequence of fracs to 
target the large oil in place in this reservoir.
Gaffney Cline & Associates (Gaffney Cline ) 
reviewed an exploration prospect in the Martinez 
del Tineo field. The prospect is a gas and condensate 
target analogous to prolific fields near the Bolivian 
border. Gaffney Cline assigned a gross mean 
unrisked Prospective Resource estimate of 570 
bcf and 14.5 million barrels of condensate. The 
economics of this prospect have been made 
materially more attractive now that the gas price in 
Argentina has increased for new discoveries from 
US$4/mcf (on which the Gaffney Cline report was 
based) to US$7.5/mcf. 
Based on this prospect, President applied for 
three open exploration concessions contiguous to 
Puesto Guardian. We were awarded two blocks as 
operator, with three years to study the prospectivity 
on the Concessions on which only sparse data are 
currently available. 
Louisiana
Operations in East White Lake and East Lake 
V erret continue to provide President with solid 
cash flow. Production is up 15% from the previous 
period at 183 boepd for the year and post year-
end it continues to rise (currently producing 
approximately 250 boepd) following a successful 
new well and recompletions. Oil prices have 
remained strong, and the bias towards oil 
production continues at 88% (2011: 66%). New 
exploration leads have also been identified.
Australia
As the Australian assets are not core to the central 
strategy of the Company, work on these assets has 
been low level, and has concentrated on finding 
industry participation in further activity on PEL 82. 
These discussions are ongoing.
Corporate
We are delighted to have welcomed Miles Biggins 
as Commercial Director and Dr. Richard Hubbard 
as Chief Operating Officer to the Board of Directors; 
each brings a wealth of relevant experience to the 
team. Dr. David Jenkins also joined the board as 
Non-Executive Deputy Chairman, bringing 50 years 
of experience with BP , BHP Billiton, Riverstone 
and others.
Two share placements were undertaken during 
the year to fund the Paraguayan farm-in, work 
programmes in both Paraguay and Argentina, and 
general working capital. The Company also agreed 
a US$15 million working capital loan facility. President Energy PLC | Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2012 04

Financial Review
Revenue for the year increased to US$11.3 million 
(2011: US$7.0 million) due to increased production 
in Argentina as a consequence of the development 
drilling undertaken in Q4 2011/Q1 2012, a full year 
of production contribution from Argentina (50% 
interest acquired in July 2011) and a 15% increase in 
production from Louisiana coupled with a further 
increased bias toward oil production 88% (2011: 
66%). Cost of sales has increased to US$8.1 million 
(2011: US$5.1 million), reflecting a full year of costs 
in Argentina. Gross profit for the year stood at 
US$3.2 million (2011: US$2.0 million).
Administrative expenses increased to US$8.5 million 
(2011: US$8.0 million) due to a full year of Argentina 
costs, the continued strengthening of the Company's 
board and recruitment of key staff to deliver 
operations. The main components of administrative 
expenses were staff costs of US$3.6 million, initial 
setup costs in Paraguay of US$0.6 million and share-
based payments of US$0.6 million.
Y ear-end cash balances of US$17.5 million 
(2011: US$6.3 million) reflect new cash raised in 
October of US$28 million less Paraguay back costs 
associated with the deal. The Group's non-current 
assets have increased to US$75.7 million (2011: 
US$54.8 million). Loan finance from IYA (a related 
party as further detailed in Note 30) was repaid in 
full in October 2012 and the Group had no debt as 
at the year end, with a new US$15 million 24 month 
facility from IYA remaining undrawn.
Outlook
President has exciting prospects in Paraguay with 
the very significant potential for exponential growth 
in shareholder value during 2013 and 2014.  The 
independent report by DeGolyer and McNaughton 
underpins management's estimate of a success 
case in Paraguay of over US$2 billion of value to 
President.
Argentina, without which we would not have the 
opportunity to invest in Paraguay, has the potential 
to materially increase production should the current 
fraccing campaign be successful.
Peter Levine
Chairman
1 May 2013
Louisiana continues to contribute to profit and cash 
flow and discussions are ongoing regarding a farm-
out of the non-core Australian asset.
President has never been in such a strong real asset 
position as it is now with Paraguay, the jewel in the 
crown of our portfolio, and we look forward with 
confidence to great success in the future.
Finally, I want to express my gratitude to my 
colleagues, management and staff.  Their efforts 
are exemplified by the professionalism and the 
expeditious way President has moved in only six 
months in Paraguay from acquisition to the start of an 
extensive seismic acquisition campaign.  It is further 
appropriate to extend my sincere appreciation to 
our loyal and patient shareholders and assure them 
that we remain fully focused on delivering them the 
rewards that their patience and loyalty deserve.
