ProStrakan Group plc Annual Report 2006
Chairman's Statement
Financial results
Turnover for the year increased  
to  38.5 million (22%) and  
on an ongoing basis by 38%, 
excluding Sandoglobuline as  
it was discontinued in 2005.  
The great majority of turnover 
arose from the sales of our 
products by our sales forces 
and was derived from organic 
rather than acquired growth: 
organic product sales growth 
was 23%, bringing product 
sales to  33.6 million. Operating 
costs remained tightly controlled 
and consequently the operating 
loss at  18.3 million was in  
line with expectations. This 
operating result is stated before 
taking account of discontinued 
operations (being our Paris-based 
Discovery unit which was sold 
during the year) with the after 
tax result after discontinued 
operations being a loss of  
 29.6 million. Cash on hand at 
the year end was  20.5 million. 
These results represent a highly 
satisfactory year on a financial 
basis combined with significant 
progress in both the pipeline 
and supporting infrastructure.
Secured debt facility
In order to fund the Group  
fully towards profitability,  
a secured debt facility of  
 50.0 million was arranged in 
March 2007. The secured debt 
facility has a five year term and 
no scheduled capital repayment 
obligations during the first three 
years. Amounts may be drawn 
down by reference to the level 
of sales from key products 
recorded by ProStrakan in the 
prior 12-month period. There is 
an initial committed drawdown 
capability of  30 million of 
which ProStrakan has now 
drawn down  20 million.  
Interest is generally charged  
at a rate of (i) the greater of  
either 3 month LIBOR or 5%  
plus (ii) a margin of between 
5.0% and 5.5%. In addition,  
the lenders have been  
issued with warrants over 
approximately 5.0 million  
shares (representing 2.5%  
of current shares in issue).  
The warrants have a 10 year  
life and an exercise price of 
98.052p per warrant.
Strategic overview
During the course of the year, 
we took the decision to divest 
our Discovery unit and this was 
successfully sold in December 
to Galapagos NV for an exit price 
of up to  45m. We had gained 
many things from its ownership 
and, through the structure of 
the sale, will continue to have 
an ongoing interest in many 
aspects of its activities without 
having to bear the costs of 
running the unit. However, 
the lead time until any of the 
projects would have become 
products for commercial sale 
was sufficiently long - and  
our in-licensing activity has  
been consistently successful 
- that we concluded that the 
annual cash running costs  
could be better deployed in 
other areas of our business, 
driving near-term revenues. 
ProStrakan made real progress on many 
fronts in 2006 towards its goal of becoming a 
profitable, sustainable, international specialty 
pharmaceutical company.

+38%
*  Excluding Sandoglobuline 
in 2005 as discontinued
Continued organic growth was 
supplemented by advances 
in all of our near-to-launch 
development programmes. 
In addition, we acquired the 
North American rights to two 
of our key European products 
and disposed of our Discovery 
unit, thereby allowing us to 
concentrate our financial 
resources on growing our 
business through product 
launches and late stage clinical 
trials. As a result, we believe we 
are well on track to achieve our 
target of break-even during 2009 
and sustainable profitability 
thereafter. The secured debt 
facility that we entered into in 
March 2007 is another marker of 
our confidence in the profitable 
future of the Company and of 
our intention to create value for 
existing shareholders.  3

Corporate development
In an active year, we built on  
the buy-out of the Rectogesic 
royalty obligations and  
in-licensing of Rapinyl towards  
the end of 2005 by undertaking  
a placing of shares in July which 
raised  1 1.3 million to cover  
the costs of these transactions. 
We then succeeded in partnering 
two of our Discovery programmes 
with excellent partners, Amgen 
and Novartis, prior to divesting 
our Discovery unit to Galapagos 
NV. We retain the majority of  
the financial upside from these 
two partnered programmes.
Our low risk approach to 
product acquisition and 
development continued to  
bear fruit as all our key 
programmes successfully 
achieved major milestones.  
The key elements of our 
business model remain:
Focusing on revenue 
and earnings growth 
Driving the sales of our 
existing in-market and 
near-to-market products 
Expanding our EU sales 
and marketing capability 
Commercial entry into  
the US
An active approach to 
licensing and M&A
Selective investment in our 
development portfolio.
We believe that this approach 
will create the most value  
for shareholders over time.
 
 
 
 
 
 
   2006 has been a transforming year for 
ProStrakan, with the Company having 
been substantially repositioned to focus 
on the regulatory approval and global 
commercialisation of its late stage 
product portfolio.

Chairman's Statement (continued)
Commercial
2006 saw the consolidation of 
the sales forces that we have 
grown organically or acquired 
with much preparation for 
the roll-out of our first pan-EU 
products which commenced 
from the beginning of 2007. 
The UK continues to be our 
largest market by some margin 
and generated over half of our 
product sales income although 
we expect revenues to become 
more geographically balanced 
over time. We have selectively 
added sales representatives in 
a number of markets and may 
continue to do this as we roll  
out additional pan-EU products 
in the future.
Development
Our lead development product, 
Sancuso, for the prevention of 
chemotherapy-induced nausea 
and vomiting (CINV) produced 
positive results in its Phase III 
trial, sufficient for us to take the 
product forward. It will enter 
the regulatory approval process 
during 2007 with launches,  
if approved, commencing the 
following year. Considerable 
progress was made with our 
near-to-market products: 
both Tostran and Rectogesic 
were approved in Europe and 
Rapinyl was submitted for 
regulatory approval, as was 
Xomolix (Drop ridol) for certain 
EU markets where it does 
not currently have marketing 
authorisation. The acquisition 
of US rights to Tostran and 
Rectogesic has meant that  
we have started the process  
of planning the final clinical  
work required to gain full 
approval for the products for 
that market. We also obtained 
promising data from our Phase I  
programme in Testosterone 
Glucoside that support further 
progress of this compound.
In Discovery, we were delighted 
to record two major partnership 
arrangements prior to the 
unit's disposal and also to retain 
substantial exposure to that 
unit's future performance both 
through a financial earn-out 
arrangement and through 
negotiating a right of first refusal 
over one of the most promising 
programmes for cancer cachexia 
once that programme reaches 
proof of concept.
People
ProStrakan has a dedicated 
workforce that brings many 
diverse skills to bear in growing 
and developing the Company. 
Sales and marketing, drug 
development and associated 
clinical and regulatory activity, 
business development, support 
services and administration 
are all essential skills and are 
being demonstrated in action 
every day. We thank all of our 
employees for their contribution 
to the very considerable 
progress that has been made 
during the year.
Perhaps the most significant 
transaction of this year was 
buying out the European 
milestone and royalty stream 
to Tostran from its licensor, 
Cellegy Pharmaceuticals Inc, 
and acquiring in the same 
transaction substantially all 
of the remaining worldwide 
rights, including the US rights, 
to both Tostran and Rectogesic. 
Together with our own 
developed product, Sancuso, 
we now have a platform around 
which to create a potentially 
highly profitable commercial 
business in the US and finding 
an entry point into the US 
market will be a priority for us.
We also continue to generate 
value from assets in geographic 
areas in which we do not intend 
to build our own sales forces. 
We sub-licensed the Central and 
East European rights and certain 
other jurisdictions to external 
partners for Tostran, Rectogesic 
and Rapinyl. We also out-licensed 
the rights to Zindaclin and 
disposed of Siklos.
  The UK continues to be our largest market by 
some margin and generated over half of our 
product sales income although we expect 
revenues to become more geographically 
balanced over time.  5

Outlook
2006 has been a transforming 
year for ProStrakan, with the 
Group having been substantially 
repositioned to focus on the 
regulatory approval and global 
commercialisation of its  
late stage product portfolio. 
All four lead products, each 
of which we believe has 
significant sales potential, made 
progress towards market launch 
during the year and we shall 
be continuing the regulatory 
process for each during 2007 , 
with revenue contributions  
from these products expected 
to climb from the second half  
of this year and during 2008. 
With the divestment of 
the Group's Discovery unit 
having also been successfully 
completed during 2006, 
delivering substantial savings 
in cash burn, as well as the 
recently-arranged secured 
debt facility, ProStrakan is now 
well positioned to achieve 
its objective of creating a 
sustainable, rapidly growing 
and profitable specialty 
pharmaceutical company.
