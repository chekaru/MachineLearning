The past year has been one of significant change and progress for the business.  
 
The Board appointed Stephen Moon as Chief Executive in July 2006, believing his skills to be ideally suited to 
this phase of the Company's development. The Board has worked closely with Stephen to refine the strategy of 
the business and to put in place the necessary working capital to achieve our aims. 
 
We believe that long-term shareholder value will be enhanced by focusing more fully on the discovery, 
development and licensing of functional and medical food technologies. This sector is substantial and is growing 
strongly, as consumers seek to enhance their health and quality of life through daily diet. This consumer demand 
is being met by major global food and beverage corporations developing new functional products. Our expertise 
in developing patented, scientifically-proven food technologies for an increasingly regulated environment leave 
us well placed to meet the needs of these potential license partners. 
 
In this respect, we were delighted to announce a major collaboration with Unilever to develop an advanced 
version of our patented Fruitflow  heart-health technology and we expect this relationship, subject to reaching 
technical, regulatory and economic milestones, to develop into a full licensing arrangement. In addition, we are 
making progress on a further project with a major international beverage brand owner to assess the feasibility of 
the launch of a Fruitflow  based beverage. The awareness created by this activity, together with the constant 
progress being made on the regulatory and scientific fronts is resulting in increased attention from brand owners 
and major ingredients businesses. The size and quality of our future partnerships is a real endorsement of the 
value of our technology. 
 
We are now also stepping up activity on our plantain-based medical food technology for the treatment of 
Crohn's Disease and are to commence human trials this year. The management team is now also actively 
seeking to acquire the rights to technologies in other areas, such as cardiovascular disease, digestive health and 
cancer prevention. 
 
Our Sirco  heart-health juice brand performed well, with 1,800 distribution points being achieved. While 
revenues were below expectations, this was in the context of reduced marketing expenditure as we focused our 
resources on potential licensing and development activities. Most importantly, the Sirco  brand has achieved its 
goal by creating a global awareness of our Fruitflow  technology within the industry.  
 
I am very positive about the Company's prospects for the year ahead and believe we have in place the 
management team, technologies and working capital to make strong progress.

Strategy and management structure 
 
The new management team has developed a focused strategy for the business which will see Provexis become a 
pure discovery, development and licensing business in functional and medical foods. Given the global market 
for functional foods is worth over $73 billion and growing faster than conventional foods, together with the 
strategic aims of global brand owners to deliver health-oriented foods and claims to consumers, we believe this 
is a fertile sector. While regulatory demands are increasing, particularly in the EU, we believe this is to our 
advantage given our approach of providing clinical proof for our claims, together with the capability of our 
management and R&D teams. 
 
As part of the strategy, we are to attempt to exit the Sirco  heart-health juice brand. This brand has served its 
purpose by raising the profile of our Fruitflow  technology globally and demonstrating consumer awareness 
and demand to potential license partners. Exiting the brand will clear the path for potential license partners who 
require certain geographic and retail channel rights and will allow for deployment of cash and human resources 
to our development and licensing activities. We believe that the brand has been a success and, indeed, the 
breadth of distribution has exceeded our expectations. However, in a sector where global brands are increasingly 
assuming a leader role, the cost of doing business is rising sharply, leading us to the conclusion that 
shareholders' interests are best served by partnering rather than competing with these major brands. 
 
In the 2007/8 financial year we intend to eliminate the bulk of Sirco  marketing and selling costs. We have also 
identified other administration, overhead and headcount savings. The result will be a reduction in total costs of 
approximately 45%.  
 
Shortly after the year end, the Company raised approximately  2.15 million through a placing of 143,316,664 
new ordinary shares at 1.5p per share. This working capital injection, together with the cost savings identified 
above, will give us sufficient cash to deliver our strategy. 
 
We see the further development of a top quality R&D team as being key to the strategy and, as a result, we will 
continue to strengthen our team during this year. The acquisition of the rights to new technologies in the areas of 
cardiovascular health, digestive health, cancer prevention and skin health will be a focus during the upcoming 
months and we are working actively in this area.  
 
Fruitflow licensing 
 
We signed a Collaboration Agreement with Unilever in March 2007 to develop a concentrated format of 
Fruitflow  for inclusion in Unilever branded products. During this year we will work with Unilever to finalise 
technical specifications, carry out clinical trials, meet regulatory requirements and identify a cost effective 
supply chain. Subject to achieving this, we expect to progress to a long term and extensive license agreement. 
Following any agreement of a license arrangement with Unilever, Provexis will retain exclusive global rights for 
the use of Fruitflow  for drinks (excluding mini-drinks) containing fruit juice, products marketed for deep vein 
thrombosis, over the counter medicines and medical products. Categories outside of the exclusive areas are 
available to Unilever on a non-exclusive basis. 
 
The management team is continuing to work with a major international beverage brand owner to assess the 
feasibility of a multi-country launch of a beverage containing Fruitflow . In addition, global business 
development activities continue, with the Company being in dialogue with a range of major brand owners and 
ingredients manufacturers. The concentrated format under development will lend itself to tablets and gel 
capsules and, as such, will provide a platform for the dietary supplement and over the counter medicine sectors 
and as a result we are exploring routes to supply these sectors.  PROVEXIS PLC

During the year, the Fruitflow  technology gained high profile recognition in the scientific arena, with the 
publication of two peer-reviewed papers in the prestigious American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The FDA 
affirmed they had no further questions related to the GRAS dossier, clearing the way for products containing 
Fruitflow  to be launched in the USA. With a new EU health claim framework being introduced, a 
comprehensive support dossier has been completed and we have lodged our claims with both local and EU 
regulators. 
Our scientific team have identified in-vitro proof of a beneficial mode of action related to the treatment of deep 
vein thrombosis and as a result we have filed a patent and will continue the development of this area. Deep vein 
thrombosis, commonly associated with economy-class airline travel, affects a wide range of people including 
those involved in long distance travel and patients immobilised for long periods in hospitals. 
   
Pipeline 
 
A US patent was granted for our plantain-based technology for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and 
specifically Crohn's Disease. We remain committed to this important technology and will carry out a healthy 
human trial in the summer, before commencing a trial on Crohn's Disease patients later in the year.  
 
Our extensive network in the global functional food sector has highlighted a number of opportunities. We are 
continuing to assess these as well as continuing the search for new functional and medical food technologies. 
Selection criteria include opportunities where we can secure full ownership of the rights and the presence or 
potential for scientific proof.  
 
Outlook 
 
I am optimistic that we will progress successfully through the milestones with Unilever and proceed to a full 
license agreement for Fruitflow . Given the ongoing discussions with a major international beverage brand 
owner, major brand owners and leading ingredients manufacturers, I am confident we will secure other areas of 
revenue generation for Fruitflow . We aim to devote more resources to the plantain technology in the coming 
months and, in parallel, we will seek to acquire further high-potential technologies. 
 
Cost saving programmes have been implemented and with our recent fund raising, we have sufficient resources 
with which to deliver the strategy. We are in advanced discussions for exiting Sirco  and expect to make an 
announcement in the near future. 
 
Overall, I believe that the business is well set for the coming financial year, with license revenues in prospect, a 
focused management team and reduced cost base in place.
